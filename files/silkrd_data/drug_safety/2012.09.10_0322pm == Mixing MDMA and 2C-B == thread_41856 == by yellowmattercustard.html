				I&#039;ve heard a lot about these two making a FANTASTIC couple. But advices and examples do vary. So let&#039;s find out few things to find the optimal way for this duet to sing.<br /><br />1. Which one goes first? MDMA or 2C-B?<br />2. How much time should I wait between taking them?<br />3. Should I correct (make lower most probably) dosages for safety reasons?<br /><br />Your experience and advices are highly welcome!<br /><br />Also advices on plugging (per-rectum) the aforementioned drugs would be appreciated.

				I used to make capsules with MDMA MDA FMA and 2c-t/c/b. And the best rolls was with 2c-t and 2c-c in my opinion.

				For adding 2c-b, take the mdma as normal, then have 2c-b about 2 hours after peak. Also take half your normal 2c-b dose. 10-15 mg is plenty for most. <br /><br />I made the mistake of taking a full dose of 2c-b. There wasn&#039;t any negative physical affects. It just turned me into a puddle with all that euphoria. By the time I came back to reality, I had no memory of the 2c-b part of the trip. Haha, good fun.

				At a festival this summer, my molly hadn&#039;t kicked in yet, so I went into the bathroom to drop another, but accidentally took 2C-B (the marking from the Sharpie which indicated the difference was gone because of nut sweat haha).&nbsp; I must say it was an awesome surprise, and I still took two more molly that night.&nbsp; Best night of my life!&nbsp; For your brain&#039;s health, however, I do not recommend taking it like this.&nbsp; Take some good molly and then a good dose of 2C-B at the tail-end of your roll.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to try it that way.

				Take the MDMA first.<br />If you&#039;re into snorting 2C-B (Not recommended, it hurts alot!) snort a 15mg line as the MDMA peak is just beginning to disappear as it hits you within about 5minutes. <br />If you&#039;re going to bomb, drop 25mg about 45/60mins into your MDMA peak. <br />You&#039;ll get a nice euphoric body/mind high along with some texture/audio hallucinations, slight pinky tan glow to everything and slight visuals. <br />Its a wonderful combination my friend!

				^^^ this is what i do when i do this particular combo and it has provided me many happy returns.<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that taking the two simultaneously can diminish some of the MDMA effects.&nbsp; <br />So do what the person before me said and get ready for a great day/night.

				Hi yellowmattercustard,<br /><br />I&#039;v recently read a very interesting article about proper use of MDMA by Metzner &amp; Adamson. I&#039;d advise it to every mdma user.<br /><br />This is a paragraph from that article:<br /><br />The only other chemical used in the present series of studies is 2-CB, which is 4-bromo-2,5- dimethoxyphenethylamine. This is more potent than MDMA, being active in some people at 18-20 mg, and 25-30 mg being the recommended maximum dose. Energy tremor, jaw clenching, heat, and greater blood pressure are the usual kind of stimulant side effects. There is great individual variation in sensitivity to this substance, so one should at all times proceed with caution, beginning always with a lower dose, and only gradually going to higher amounts. Psychologically, 2-CB is empathogenic, like MDMA, although it appears to be somewhat more body oriented and also to have some mild visual effects not unlike mescaline. Some therapists and researchers have experimented with MDMA, followed three to four hours later by 2-CB, which basically serves to extend the empathogenic experience by the same amount again. <br /><br />source: https://www.maps.org/research/mdma/revision.html

				Okay, thanks everyone. Next week I&#039;m gonna try to take it like 2c-b after MDMA and comment on experience. After significant break (1 month) I&#039;ll try this vice versa and make a report in this topic also.<br /><br />If anybody is going to try one of these - please comment, let&#039;s collect the experience here.<br /><br />BTW, does this mixture have a name? Maybe we should call it somehow? Like somehtingflipping or mollynexing or nexyrolling?

				I&#039;ve experimented a little bit with this combo and it&#039;s super nice.&nbsp; Even a small amount of 2CB after a good molly roll with give the desired effect, so you can start with as little as 5mg, snorted.<br /><br />Yeah, 2CB is nasty stuff to snort, but the rush is worth a little stinging, yeah? :)&nbsp; Plus, if you snort it after taking molly, you avoid the rough come-up and go straight to the fun bit&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />What I like to do is take 100-160mg of molly, then as I&#039;m coming down from the peak, I snort 5-10mg of bees.&nbsp; The actual quantity depends on you.&nbsp; For me, I started at 100mg of molly taken orally, then T+3:00 snorted 10mg of bees and that was a plenty mad euphoric rush for me.&nbsp; I do distinctly remember saying &#039;fuck&#039; a lot and having to catch my breath&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />All-in-all, a wicked combo and heaps of fun.&nbsp; Can&#039;t believe this shit is illegal.&nbsp; ::)

				Tried this combo few days ago.&nbsp; Me and my girlfriend took MDMA (200 and 150 mg) and approx 4 hours later some 2-CB.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t nice.<br /><br />My girlfriend had constant fear.<br /><br />I was OK but not too high, no intense euphoria or empathy or anything else. Some slight visuals, some nice body high but really nothing special if to compare to what we have on MDMA. Plus I became horny as hell. Sooooo horny! But I could not come because of previously taken MDMA. It is always like that but 2-cb made my libido even worse. So I had sex for a few hours and my dick and testicles and belly were in severe pain by the end of the day.<br />Luckily we became very sleepy soon.

				ive tried this combo a few times.<br /><br /><br />im doing it again this weekend!<br /><br /><br />all in all, if you do it right (seriously drop 2cb as U ARE COMING OFF your peak), it bring your trip back to a higher gear and yet gives it a smoother, calmer decent back to baseline.<br /><br />one thing that is fantastic with this awesome chemical duo it the laughter! i have never laughed so much for so long on any drug, ever<br /><br />cant wait to do this again, will hopefully remember to post about it here or somewhere similar sunday/monday

				YMC, I guess people just react differently. I&#039;m still going to have to try this after the review stickafinger has given.

				So I tried it again. It turned out to be nothing very special to me. Actually it wasn&#039;t my best MDMA high. And followed by 2C-B immediately after MDMA started to wear out it was nice but not very euphoric state. I guess I just need to wait and &#039;recharge&#039; my brain for a next good roll.<br />And this was the first time I had strong visuals from 2C-B. Amazing and nothing like LSD or 25.

				BTW, there was an amazing effect when I was falling asleep after taking this combo. I was very sleepy (2C-b effect), but at the same time my mind was still alert (MDMA typical insomnia). And I started to breath as only deeply sleeping person can breath. I inhaled deeply and noisy, I never breathe like that when I&#039;m awake. And still I was totally understanding what is going on, my mind was on.<br />So it was like sleeping and not sleeping at the same time. Alert mind in a sleeping body.<br /><br />And before that I&#039;ve bit my tongue in such a state. Rather scary effect.

				How are the hangover effects the next day? If there are any? (assuming SR quality mdma). Considering trying this combo out, but I might have to travel the day after, and I want to know how miserable I&#039;d be.

				Some people have headache after 2c-b, but there is definitely no &#039;hangover&#039; after MDMA. However I would not recommend taking this before travel. Especially if you drive. You may have &#039;afterglow&#039; after MDMA (some residual feelings of empathy, enhanced sensitivity, sexual arousal), which is very nice state but not when you have to do something.<br />Also you most probably will be lack of sleep so you may have trouble with attention and taking care of passport/visa/custom declaration.<br /><br />I took this combo twice with moderate dosages of each substance and had no significant afterglow next day. I guess this depends on your tolerance.

				planning on trying mdma + 2cb at the same time. Will report back with the experience in a month or 2. They have synergistic effect, so will dose 170mg/20mg<br /><br />Taking 2c-b when coming down from the mdma peak is what&#039;s recommended by most, but will love to hear all ur experiences on the combo taken at the same time.

				One good reason to take them together at the same time is that you get to experience the come up of both at the same time.&nbsp; Me likey.

				So, I try to take as many drugs in as varied of combinations as I can to ensure I have lots of info for you all. In my opinion, 2CB is best used after an MDMA roll.... however... it goes really nice with straight MDA. The visuals are so similar to MDA that I get all the physical goodness of MDA plus it amps the visuals up a few notches. I&#039;ve combined with MDMA before and it&#039;s all right but I normally take MDMA for the love and the visuals from 2CB tend to be a little overkill. I take MDA for the visuals and powerful body feels like god thing so 2CB snaps right into that blend just fine.<br /><br />If you are a rave / party user, the visuals might be fun on MDMA with 2CB but it just complicates home use since it becomes hard to tell where your girls face is so you can kiss it.

I was trying to be all sweet and loving but as she sat there the whole &quot;You look really fucking weird&quot; thing kept popping into my head. I guess on MDA I am a little more into the visual mindset so I can welcome stuff like that a bit more. On MDMA I sort of just like everything being really beautiful.
