				I&#039;m just curious on the comparison between the two, mainly about potency.&nbsp; I have a decent tolerance and take 30-50mg&#039;s orally and feel damn good.&nbsp; I see that most DHC Dihydrocodeine pills I see are very high mg&#039;s.&nbsp; So... is it like 300mg to 30mg of oxycodone.&nbsp; I see those narcotice calculators on the web and all are different.&nbsp; Also, is there a difference between regular codeine compared to DHC.&nbsp; I love me some opiates and just looking for my best bang for my buck when it comes to pills.&nbsp; Yes, I know H, is definitely the best bang for your buck.&nbsp; Just looking for some members experiences with the drug and thoughts about it.&nbsp;

				all I know is from what I read on another forum, <br /><br />10mg Hydrocodone = 60mg DHC<br /><br />oxy is only slightly stronger. Sorry I don&#039;t have any experience with this drug, but figured I&#039;d say something since I love the opiates so much. <br />I doubt the high would be too similar to oxy though, from what I read. More like vicodin, the relaxed euphoria, not the speediness that oxy seems to have.<br /><br />Just read the Wiki, it will tell you plenty.<br />Have fun!

				hydro is soooo bomb<br />almost milli for milli comparison to oxy... personally prefer the hydro<br /><br />DHC, on the other hand is shit, and like guy said, the dose equivalents of DHC to oxy or hydro are going to be astronomical.<br /><br />because it&#039;s shit.<br /><br />so, get something else. it&#039;s mostly a waste of time. like, if people want a solid opiate high, i don&#039;t understand why not just buy smack? $/dose, it&#039;s so much more cost effective and so much nicer...

				the DHC seems kinda like poor mans vicodin, so if you don&#039;t wanna do H get some vics or perks, or some OC&#039;s or something. <br />Seems the best thing on SR is oxy 30s, a couple sellers have them for around $1/mg. close to street price for where I am located but it used to be half that before the OC&#039;s got changed and a lot harder to come by.

				the only dihydrocodeine I saw for sale was from toyotaman which was a shame when he turned cunt and scammed people but was a mixed blessing because it means I have discovered oxycodone which thus far has been beautiful. not sure i&#039;m ready to try H. strong prejudice I know.
