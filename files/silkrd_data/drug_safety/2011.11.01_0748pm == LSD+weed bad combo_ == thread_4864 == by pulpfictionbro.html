				So i had taken some lsd and weed about a month ago and had the most terrifying, profound and deep trip ever. Although it wasnt my first time on either drug it was my first time mixing the two.<br /><br />This past weekend i repeated this but was keeping tabs on how i was feeling. So here&#039;s what happened (written in 1st person),<br /><br />1 pm - first lsd tab<br />2 pm - minor lsd effects, minor visualizations, high heart beat rate, overall calm and feeling good.<br />2:30 pm - second lsd tab since the first one didnt do much. <br />3:30 pm - feeling awesome and high. <br />4:15 pm - Smoked the first bowl.<br />5 pm - Enhanced lsd effects, probably the peak of the trip?<br />5:30 pm - Not feeling great anymore, dark shadows in corners, paranoid, delusional, not able to concentrate on a single thing.&nbsp; I think the marijuana makes it harder to keep control very confused.<br />6 pm - all lights are on, beginnings of a bad trip (same as the one a month ago), trying to be rational and sane but its hard. Watching tv but the character on the tv looks scary. What are they even talking about? Cant concentrate, multiple thoughts at the same time, lost in my own mind. Who am i? Getting a sinking feeling in my stomach, naseous maybe because i am hungry? Havent had anything since 1.<br />7 pm - get a grip, dont lose yourself, this has happened before you can get through.<br />8 pm - looks like the thc is wearing off, feeling better now<br />9 pm - In control, lsd is still active but not scared anymore<br /><br />After that i just rode it out easily so i think maybe the weed is what effects the trip or did i take too much? It was only after smoking the weed that i started having bad ideas and sorta lost control and thats when the lsd takes over and really messes me up. <br /><br />Am i the only one? I know bad trips occur for a number of reasons but i have taken lsd a number of times in the past and not had any bad experiences its only when i combine the two when shit happens.

				Dude thate harsh you had to experience that. I agree with blackops I smoke like an 8th day so no matter what drug I take I will.always want a spliff and with lsd I like smoke like 1 joint during the tripping I basically just hold it all time and take the few drags at a time which works and does not cause the extreme paranoia. Hope ya dont have to experience a bad trip again there never good to go through been there before with that dirty salvia

				Hmm i think you are right it must be the paranoia and the fear (i HATE the fear)<br /><br />But i smoke like everyday but not an 8th more like 0.2-0.3 gms :P (i dont need more because i vaporize) but i feel happy when just smoking weed. Weird...

				Ye the paranoia is a bitch can fuck up ur trips. Well if you smoke more the more tolerence builed up and u can handle with other drugs cus I agree with you smoking weed makes me feel great but if u cant handle it with other drugs the other drugs bring out the worse of it by like 10x blackops told me that and it makes sense I can handle so thats prob why I dont get bad trips from it. Thats awsome you have a vaporiza wish I had one

				I&#039;ve not had a problem.. In fact, if anything, the weed seems to reduce the effects of the acid for me. First time I took lsd I was a bit nervous and so my friends and I smoked loads of weed, and I&#039;m pretty sure I was mostly high all night with the lsd poking through occasionally. Since, I&#039;ve kept the weed to a minimum (maybe 2-3 bongs over the ~8 hours) and enjoyed it a lot more.

				Marijuana and LSD is a great combo.&nbsp; I know loads of people that wouldn&#039;t even think about touching LSD without a joint or two.<br /><br />Marijuana potentiates LSD to such a degree that it&#039;s easy to get swept off your feet when combining the two.&nbsp; With experience you will learn to love it.

				Any rough patches I&#039;ve experienced while on LSD occurred while not high. After a few trips I came to this realization and now make sure I always have some bud to toke during a trip. Smoking up right after dosing makes it come on much easier in my opinion. I&#039;m sorry you had a difficult experience though&nbsp; :-\

				I like to smoke a little as soon as I start to comedown from LSD. This usually increases the effects of the acid for a bit. Then smoke again when almost sober to help sleep. If you get really paranoid a benzo can take the edge off, but might dull the experience. Inhale a nitrous balloon to go to another world. ;)

				LSD and weed are perfect for each other in my opinion. I mix them aallll the time, at any point during the LSD trip and they work perfect together!<br /><br />I can take up to 5 hits of 100 mics and not lose it (ego death). when i don&#039;t lose it, i can smoke weed during the whole trip and without any troubles. I think i have done it so much that I am used to it! I think that the more you do it, the less bad experiences you will have with it. So i say, you should do it a lot more :)<br /><br />But when I lose it, i forget who I am, where I am, who i am with, and i think that i died. This hasn&#039;t happened to me in a long time, and I think i need to eat at least a 10 strip to feel it again. But it is only at that point that i CANNOT smoke ANY weed while on lucy.....<br /><br />Most people I know (me included) ALWAYS smoke copious amounts of weed during LSD trips and we find it to be amazing. Both amazing drugs, but lucy will always be king in my book...<br />

				the only bad trip i ever had was when smoking and tripping together. i was in a room with 5 or 6 people, and I ate the acid (probably about 200 mcgs), waited about an hour and then smoked a blunt. i had severe paranoia, felt like everyone was giving me dirty looks and every time anyone would laugh i swore it was about me. I couldn&#039;t stop thinking that at any time someone was going to come in with a gun and kill us all, then someone did actually come in and my heart rate sped up like crazy... the paranoia went away as i came down off the weed, and no one else had the same experience. I&#039;ve tripped at least 20 times, and even when they get dark and even &#039;sinister&#039; they&#039;ve never resulted in this kind of paranoia. then again, I&#039;m a firm believer in &#039;atmosphere is everything&#039; when tripping, and who knows? it could of been poor lighting or the wrong mix of people.

				Personally I would never take LSD *without* weed, but weed has never made me nervous/paranoid. If that&#039;s a common side effect of weed for you, I guess you should be cautious.

				I&#039;ve never had an issue myself... but I don&#039;t get paranoia from anything I&#039;ve ever smoke or eaten.<br />I guess if you are susceptible to paranoia I would avoid combining, or maybe take a xanax at the beginning to calm you down.

				I can&#039;t speak to your specific situation but I can say that I have witnessed 3 freak outs on LSD and 2 of them where shortly after mixing weed in. I am a med mj user and have never had any bad trips on any substance... though Salvia was a biiiiiiitch. <br /><br />Both people described the feeling as losing their ability to keep track of time... the feeling of dejavu every minute or two so powerful that they were convinced that they had done something terribly wrong.<br /><br />Sounds similar to the first time I mixed weed with DXM... I was all over the place. Unable to stay inside a moment.
