				You could still fail.&nbsp; Holding a shirt over your face is not going to stop you from inhaling everything.&nbsp; Not sure how much you would actually need to get into your system before you will trigger a positive, but you could probably get enough in you.&nbsp; I would get yourself a test kit and test yourself before hand, so at least you have an idea or not if your in for a bad day.
