				I took 175MG of MDMA about 2-3 hours ago. I feel &quot;ok&quot;. A little warm, but ok. I was expecting a lot more, but what I wanted to ask is body size a factor in dosing? I&#039;m a big and tall person. I&#039;m over 6 feet tall and over 300lbs. Football player type. Do you think I&#039;m not getting the full affect at 175MG? Barely no euphoria at all, just balmy hands I guess. I can wait a few weeks until trying again but I&#039;m almost tired and could fall asleep. I thought this stuff supposed to pump me up? Hey, maybe I need 200MG +?<br /><br />

				No don&#039;t bother taking any more mate. Just leave it. It&#039;s probably that the Mandy was impure or that you aren&#039;t reacting to MD this evening. That sounds like an odd thing to say but with MD sometimes you are just not able to come up properly because it can be subjective to your mood or something. <br /><br />The most likely probability is that it&#039;s bunk product. Just leave it because you don&#039;t know what the impurities will be in it if there are. Just chill out, drink some OJ, and maybe take a Valium and call it a night. <br /><br />

				MDMA dose is recommended at 1.5mg/kg - 2mg/kg. At 300lbs you&#039;re looking at a dosage of between ~200mg - ~275mg. Since you had 175mg, it&#039;s close enough to 200mg that you should be feeling a little more euphoric than you describe but it&#039;s likely that, as mentioned above, the product was probably impure. Next time try closer to 250mg of that same batch and if it&#039;s even MDMA at all it&#039;ll make you feel right.

				Yeah take it on an empty stomach too, it makes it alot more intense. It can take several hours before you start to feel anything though, I only weigh about 100lbs. and at a 130mg dose I sometimes don&#039;t feel it until much later in the day/night.

				I&#039;m a big guy too and my magic number is 200mg. Any less and it feels like something is missing.
