				I&#039;m thinking sort of like a homebake, I suppose it&#039;s called. You would have to get the morphine from the pills, cleave the sulphate, react with AA, then add some HCl, is how I&#039;m guessing the reaction would go. How to get rid of sulphate, though?

				How about this TEK?<br /><br />http://forum.opiophile.org/archive/index.php/t-9267.html<br /><br />NEver tried it and am not a chemist by any means so if it works I have no clue.

I just wonder what sort of yield I can expect, potency (whether fully converted to diacetyl, etc) and whathaveyou. If I could get 3 grams MS contin, and turn it into 2.5g heroin, that I would be quite happy with. Then I could cut it by a third, and have some absolute fire. Hmm....

				Ya I would think you would have to cut it too to keep from OD&#039;ing folks who are going to IV a whole point and not understand what they are getting into. So would this be water soluble or would you have to use citric acid to dissolve it? It may be obvious but as I said I have no chemistry knowledge.

				I think it would be either way. If you stopped with the acetylization of the morphine to heroin, and purifyied, I think that would be the base that would require citric. Probably great for smoking, though. Or, you combine with HCl and that will make the &quot;No.4&quot; heroin hcl. Yeah, I think purity would be a concern. I think 60-70% is perfect; excellent high, not too dangerous, and stretches the product just a bit for the seller. And some adulterants add to the high, with is an additional bonus.
