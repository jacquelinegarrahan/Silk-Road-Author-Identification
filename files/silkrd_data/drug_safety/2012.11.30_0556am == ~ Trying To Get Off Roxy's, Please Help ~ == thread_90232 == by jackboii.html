				i have my last few pills here , about 4 15mg roxy&#039;s, and tomorrow is going to be the last day i will be doing them in incraments (halfs throughout the day) <br /><br />i have weened myself off of these for the past week, going from taking 5 30&#039;s a day, to 3 30&#039;s a day, to 5 15&#039;s a day, to 4 15&#039;s a day, and now i have my last 4. i plan on doing them all tomorrow to get it over with, and then the next day try and stay as hydrated as possible and eat plenty food until i start to feel the withdrawals. <br /><br />i have quite a few suboxone, but i REFUSE to get hooked on those too, i need some suggestions, but my plan is to wait until i feel the withdrawal and put 4mg&#039;s of suboxone (2mg on each under side of my tounge) .. the suboxone should last around 48 hours so once that weakens up i plan on just taking 2mg (1mg on each side under tounge) and just stay hydrated, eat as much as possible, work out to sweat the shit out and go out in the sun to sweat some more.<br /><br />if anyone has suggestions or remedies to help the withdrawal symptoms PLEASE im begging you give them, i really hate going through the pure hell of withdrawals. this is really a big step for me stopping myself without anyone else telling me to or the help of anyone, im just sick of doing these things, lost alot of weight, and am just not myself. <br /><br />PLUS i CANT FUCKING PEAK when i eat MDMA anymore because of these damn opiates. so please, any suggestions for detoxing would help. thanks alot.

				you just gotta tough it out man, and never go there again<br /><br />grab some imodium. it helps alot if you get stomach issues. if its just roxis you probably will be alright within 1-2 weeks<br /><br />if you can score some prescription drugs, pick up some clonidine, it helps alot with chills and sweats<br />also some promethazine for nausea<br /><br />oh yeah... have a nice fat bong and an ounce of weed on hand... this will be your best friend.

				I would stretch your 4 15mg roxies over the next 3 days<br /><br />2 Tomarrow<br /><br />1 1/2 the next day<br /><br />1/2 the day after the next <br /><br />Would suggest staying away from any stimulant (even caffeine) to help with the sleep issue, and try to physically tire yourself a bit.<br /><br />I would also suggest taking 1 MG of xanax (if you don&#039;t normally take it) before bed for 1 or 2 days. <br /><br />Good Luck, getting off shit is a bitch (happened to me with xanax and I didn&#039;t even abuse the shit)

				i&#039;ve heard positive things about using ibogain to break opiate addiction. i would do a lot of research about it before attempting though, because there can be bad results and it is extremely dangerous to do.

Loperamide is an synthetic opioid, it&#039;s an opioid-receptor agonist that acts on the receptors in your large intestine. It is designed to not cross the blood brain barrier so it doesn&#039;t get your high. However there seems to be some controversy to this, as large doses (80mg+) can keep a heroin addict out of withdrawal, and some people report actually getting a pleasant, mild opiate glow. I can tell you from experience that it does work, while some claim no benefit from it, most will at least get out of withdrawal.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works for me. If you plan on taking a break from, or getting off your opiate of choice, get high the night before, when you wake up, and are starting to feel withdrawal setting in, take 30 of them (I take 80mg for my first dose), 60mg, then 20mg every couple hours until you&#039;re ok enough. The first day isn&#039;t great, you&#039;ll probably still feel tired, maybe a tad restless, but nothing like full blown withdrawal. The second day however, if your body chemistry is like mine, you will feel halfway decent, if not good, at the very least you&#039;ll feel normal, not high, just ...normal. On the second day you don&#039;t have to take as many, 40-60mg, I&#039;d break it into 40mg twice, once in the morning, and again in the early evening. Loperamide has a pretty long half life, I have found that after the first high dose day, and the following day or two at lower doses, I don&#039;t have to take anything for a day or two.<br /><br />The good thing about the long half life is, that once you have done the high dose &quot;induction&quot; day, and the few following lower dose days, before you know it a week has gone by, and you are passed what would be the worst of your days straight cold turkey from you DOC. Now you can start lowering the dosages of the&nbsp; Lope, the second week, drop to 30mg a day, or try going a day without and then dosing 30mg if you start feeling ill, the week after that drop to 20mg a day, and so on until you get to jump off. Now, the jump is going to be a little uncomfortable, you&#039;ll probably have some stomach aches, some restlessness at night, but it will be very, very mild compared to jumping off a full agonist opiate.<br /><br />Now you may be thinking, &quot;Taking all that Imodium, will I be able to crap?&quot; The first day, probably not, the second day maybe, if you try you should be able to. Once your body gets used to the Lope however you will be able to go fairly easily. You can counter this the same way opiate users do, either just deal with it, or take a laxative with it, or eat lots of fiber. That&#039;s another thing, using Lope you can actually eat, and get hungry, as opposed to cold turkey where you&#039;re puking and pissing out of your butt, and can&#039;t eat anything for a few days.<br /><br />Anyways, good luck on your journey, may you end up where you want to be.

				ibogain is a really powerful hallucinogen that has the ability to break an opioid addiction when you take it at the right dose. it comes from iboga root bark. i honestly don&#039;t know too much about it, but they did do a drugs inc about it being used to break opioid addictions with success.

				Iv&#039;e been on roxy&#039;s and oxycontin for close <br />to 10 years recreationally..Ive &quot;had&quot; to stop <br />numerous times..Today i&#039;ve taken about 3 40mg <br />tablets ..anyhow on stopping ..Here&#039;s how i do <br />it...I know its really hard ...I know it takes<br />alot of willpower...The first thing i&#039;ll say is<br />i don&#039;t recommend the methadone clinic...Been their<br />done that...I found it twice as hard to get off methadone..<br /><br />So anyhow this will require some willpower and determination <br />on your part...This is not gospel this is just how i do it....<br /><br />....Things you will need....<br /><br />energy drinks --preferably redline<br />daily vitamins<br />gabbapentin or xanax but the gabba works the best and i think is legal<br />Roxi 30mg pills<br />exercise<br /><br /><br />Be ready and start ...Don&#039;t take any roxi until you start feeling <br />slight WD&#039;s ...Take just enough to lessen the WD&#039;s ..But not enough<br />to feel great...the idea is to go through WD&#039;s ..But gradual easy ones<br /><br />At the same time take 1/2 of a green gabbapentin..Along with the <br />small bit of Roxi..The Gabba takes about 2 days to get used to.<br />The first time you take it,you&#039;ll feel kinda messed up.This is <br />normal ,after the second or third time .You will adjust to it<br />It feels kinda similar to Roxi and xanax but is not a narcotic.<br />It will amplify and opiate you combine it with..<br /><br />The Gabba gets rid of the mental anguish ,which i think is the <br />hardest part about quitting..You&#039;ll feel almost &quot;ZERO&quot; mental <br />torment .Which i litterally couldn&#039;t believe it when i tried it.<br />And the WD&#039;s will seem very faint ..It really is a miracle when <br />it comes to this process...<br /><br />Take the vitamins every day and energy drinks as needed ,when you <br />feel heavy limbs,and lethargy...<br /><br />Gradually reduce your roxi amount ,but keep taking the 1/2 gabba<br />every day and time you would take the roxi..After 4 days<br />your mostly out of the woods ,for the hard part.....<br /><br />Gradually take less and less gabba..You should by then be <br />off the pills...the hardest part by far is &quot;staying off&quot; <br />the roxi&#039;s once you quit..As life will seem boring and <br />time will pass very slow...<br /><br />This is how i do it...i am not a doctor ..but just maby<br />some of this info may help you ..I feel your pain ,and financial<br />destruction....Best of luck to you ..and if i can help in any way<br />pm me......&nbsp; &nbsp; and im sure you know cannabis helps out alot with the process as well<br /><br />Daft

				Dear Jack,<br /><br />I know what you are going through brother.&nbsp; Due to a neck and back injury in 04 that required neck fusion surgery, and lower back surgery... I was put on oxycontin and roxicontin for chronic pain.&nbsp; I dont need to get into the whole story but if anybody has been there these pills take hold of your soul and heart...<br /><br />I have kicked maybe two dozen times over the years... AND each time it seems to get harder... because you just DREAD the feeling you will have and the NOT sleeping at all.... I think I went 9 days without sleep once.... maybe 30 min a night.&nbsp; Terrible leg shakes and sweats... I even started to have seizures.... I think I have had&nbsp; seven over the last five years...&nbsp; I have also had End stage kidney failure in both kidneys... <br />&nbsp;<br />So brother.... I have been there... I am there... and I pray for you...&nbsp; Tramadol is what helped me and of course cannabis in strong edible doses,&nbsp; Fresh juice, and veggie drinks.... small walks around the house or block ...&nbsp; SUNshine...&nbsp; If you can make cannabis&nbsp; edibles strong enough you WILL sleep...&nbsp; RSO (Rick simpson oil)&nbsp; see Run from the Cure...<br /><br />I am ashamed to say that the past year I have been taking a HUGE dose each day prescribed by by doctor.... 420mg a day.&nbsp; Three 80mg, and six 30mg...&nbsp; Of course in the beginning&nbsp; (04) I took my pills like a good patient and just ate them.&nbsp; Then so called friends said they would work better if I crushed them and railed them up my nose..... I wish to GOD I never was tempted to see what that first line was like...&nbsp; That was a bad choice....<br /><br />The good news is I found Silk Road.&nbsp; I just found the site 10 days ago.&nbsp; I have been on a quest for LSD for some time as I have found it greatly reduces my pain level perception.&nbsp; I grabbed some WOW from JahBUDS and was so happy I did.&nbsp; The LOVE that flows from LSD makes you reconsider what you are doing to yourself.... I mean we all know there has to be a better way right?&nbsp; Why kill yourself for a nothing high that in the end you are just taking to not be sick?&nbsp; Does not make sense.....<br /><br />In the last week since I knew I found SR. and Lucy... I have reduced my dosage from 420mg a day down to 160mg a day.&nbsp; Two 80mg each day.&nbsp; I dont know but it seems the leap from high doses to medium 420-160 is quite easy (for me) compared to the weeks that you try to get off the lower doses..... Does that make any sense at all?<br /><br />If you are down to two 15mg a day I would say you are almost there..... If I were you I would just stop TODAY and like the poster above said DONT LOOK BACK.&nbsp; It is so easy just to keep going.... or to return to the pills.&nbsp; It takes real courage to walk away and live your life...<br /><br />I think LSD can help me and others do that.&nbsp; They give Ibogain to heroin addics.. Why should LSD not be effective for Oxy and Roxi addiction?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know I am rambling.... I did not sleep last night... but I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone... many have been there.&nbsp; You can succeed.&nbsp; The thought has gone through my head, hey what if I sold some........&nbsp; if you look on SR you see vendors making a fortune selling these pills.&nbsp; 420mg a day sold on the Road would be a small fortune to most people.&nbsp; I could get rich and get off these pills at the same time.... But you know what man... I could not hurt my fellow brother like that.&nbsp; Selling him death for a dollar.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; LSD is LIFE and I would rather be poor ( i am ) than contribute to someones death.&nbsp; I could not have that on my head....<br /><br />So Good luck man.... just stop today if you can.&nbsp; Dont look back.&nbsp; I think I will be there soon.&nbsp; I have found the help I need to get off these pills and it comes in a drop or a small paper square or a microdot...<br /><br />I wish you the best.... please pm me if you wish to talk or just need to vent... <br /><br />Look in your heart... listen to your mind.&nbsp; <br /><br />All the Best&nbsp; &nbsp;:)
