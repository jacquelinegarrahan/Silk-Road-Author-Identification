				Combination with psychotherapy is one of the oldest known medical uses of mdma, but it is good to see that this is still being researched. <br /><br />I hope that in the near future such things will not even be news at all. Research into the clinical application of substances that can also be used as recreational drugs has been slowed down too much. This applies to a host of substances including mdma, but also lsd, cannabis and numerous others. <br /><br />It seems that substances that have any recreational potential are shunned from research, unless there is no alternative. Morphine is broadly used clinically, but milder substances seem to be mostly ignored completely.

				Agree with Ben I do know psychotherapists that use MDMA and they can vouch that it works - But people do need to know when they are doing before hand and need to be trained as it can have devastating consequences

				I think its great that its finally gaining acceptance in certain circles of society, i was reading the other day how it is being researched to help children and young adults to cope with autism.<br /><br />&nbsp;Could MDMA be the next &#039;legalize&#039; poster child after weed eventually is legalized? <br /><br />Maybe this is just a poor attempt by the federal government to get drugies to join the military...who knows? lol

				Well, on the long run MDMA might be a candidate for legalization. <br /><br />Cannabis is a natural substance (at least to some degree considering the potency of strains available at the moment) that can be unbanned. Banning a plant seems a bit silly, especially when growing plants that yield more dangerous substances like poppies is perfectly legal in most countries. <br /><br />MDMA would be the first synthetic recreational drug to be legalized, which would be a milestone as such. I think it will take quite some time for that to happen though. <br /><br />Danger to&nbsp; health seems to be a small factor in the process however - drinking and smoking are quite hazardous but legal. Something like eating a pound of chocolate a day also is legal, although doing so will probably kill you much faster than most &#039;recreational drugs&#039; could.

				MDMA is also good for depression in my experience. It breaks the loop of helplessness by reminding the patient that they physically can feel good and happy.<br /><br />Of course this is just my personal experience, and I think you would have to go into the session with an open mind to these sorts of things, but I like to imagine how powerful the effect would be if some trained psychologists/psychiatrists (forget which one uses substances...) were involved in directing patients.

				The government wants to use drugs to brainwash the population.<br /><br />That&#039;s why we are moving towards the gradual decriminalisation of all drugs.<br /><br />It&#039;ll start with medical cannabis, MDMA, etc.<br /><br />Eventually LSD and mushrooms will be decriminalised.<br /><br />And they&#039;ll be used to brainwash the population.<br /><br />This is because LSD and mushrooms wipe clean old personality baggage, so that people can start over fresh with a new personality. I&#039;ve done this myself.<br /><br />This can be a good thing.<br /><br />But it can also be used by the government to build new personalities that serve their own agendas. Brainwashing, in other words.<br /><br />LSD and mushrooms have the potential both for good and evil.

				That seems very far fetched, but if the net result is legal availability of substances like mdma, it sounds like a perfectly good line of reasoning to pursue :D
