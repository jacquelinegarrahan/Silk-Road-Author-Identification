				with LSD? I dont think so.<br /><br />i found something interesting:<br />&quot;Tolerance and cross-tolerance relationships between lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) were studied in rats trained on an operant task. The results demonstrated that behavioral tolerance to both compounds occur in the rat and that asymmetrical cross-tolerance relationships exist; that is, animals tolerant to 5-HTP were cross-tolerant to LSD, but animals tolerant to LSD were not cross-tolerant to 5-HTP.&quot;<br /><br />I remember reading studies about measuring serotonin levels in rats after giving them LSD-25 and its analogues. The levels decreased drastically after the administration of the drug. It slowly went back up to the normal as the effects of the drug faded.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think&nbsp; if you preaload 5-HTP the serotonin levels you begin with will be higher and LSD will not be able to decrease the levels as much as when you don&#039;t preload with 5-HTP. (LSD dose is the same in both cases) This effect is like a a&nbsp; tolerance. <br /><br />If you dose 5-HTP after LSD You might get some&nbsp; interesting effect but i think there is a possibility that it would just result in a faster comedown. <br /><br />I could be totally wrong tho. <br />Try It! <br />It sounds like a pretty harmless combo.<br />

				Taking 5-htp and also taking substances like mdma is not recommended really. <br /><br />The psychological effects may seem very limited, but the combination is quite dangerous as it could lead to serotonin syndrome which can has very serious consequences sometimes. There is no guarantee that you will suffer these effects, but the risk is serious. The condition is not always deadly if you have access to medcal services quickly, but it certainly can be if you do not.
