				Alright, I know this is a weird question but bear with me. Do you grind your weed? I used to have a grinder back when I was smoking regurally and most of my friends did. But not I&#039;m hanging around new people who insist on NOT using a grinder? I don&#039;t know though. I was wondering if it makes it any different, like do you lose extra THC when you grind because the kief falls off? Or it just a matter of personal preference. Personally I like to grind mine, but that just me. I find it easier to smoke that way.

				Wooden grinders have round edges on the teeth. <br />Causing the weed to be pulled apart, rather then shredding to bits.<br /><br />Metal Grinders have diamond cut steel teeth. <br />Causing the weed the be shredded, and trichomes falling in to the keif tray.<br /><br />Wood is the best choice.<br /><br />

				I dont really smoke anymore but when i did i always just broke it up with my fingers over a piece of paper, never saw the reason to spend $20 on a grinder, plus having that huge piece of paraphenelia to carry around with you in the car on the way to ur buddys house to go smoke

				Always grindin&#039;<br /><br />Then for special occasions (Such as 4/20) I take ALL that delicious keef that builds up and I lay out fat coke-sized rails in some zigzags and twist up some curiously strong, chronic joints. We went through 7 of them on Saturday.<br /><br />Sometimes I&#039;ll just roll a normal spliff but sneak a fat pocket of keef in the middle somewhere then watch as it goes around a circle... You&#039;ll notice who gets it :) -- Its a stoner russian roulette

				I just rip it up with my fingers, then pack it in my bowl. No need to fuss with a grinder.

				Yes - metal with kief catcher. I grind the weed and tobacco together for an even mix.
