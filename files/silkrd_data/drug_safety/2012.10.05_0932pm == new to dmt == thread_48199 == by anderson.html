				i got some dmt freebase to sample from elvis. it was a tan color. i expected it to have a strong psychedelic experience with all kinds of extra worldly things going on, but i got was a nice mellow, albeit meditative feeling that lasted for a good 15 mins and had me in good spirits the rest of the day. what should i have expected?

				either you didnt start with high enough dose <br /><br />or the product was low quality<br /><br />or your method of administration was too inefficient. possibly you pyrolyzed the compound, didnt take a large enough dose rapidly<br /><br />if you take a large enough hit of n,n-dmt you should experience intense visual activity and even become completely dissociated but obviously this was not your experience<br /><br />if you are on an ssri or something then you cant trip anyway

				I&#039;ve smoked elvis&#039; DMT and managed to get very good experiences off of it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to blast off from DMT period but to me that&#039;s okay and is mostly because I haven&#039;t wanted too.&nbsp; I have had amazing experiences with it and it&#039;s opened my mind more then anything else I&#039;ve experienced.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also had a very scary experience with it when I went in with to many expectations and doubt.<br /><br />Do not burn it.&nbsp; Do not burn it.&nbsp; Do not burn it.&nbsp; You need to vape that shit.<br /><br />Either get a glass meth pipe, a glass vapor genie, or chase it on some tin foil but don&#039;t burn it.&nbsp; If it tastes harsh and shitty you&#039;re burning it.&nbsp; If you feel like you need to cough up some DMT flavored lung cheese when you come down you&#039;re burning it.&nbsp; If your SO tells you your house smells like shit after you smoke it, again you&#039;re burning it.<br /><br />The three hits rule is a myth, as is the do it all under one minute or wait an hour rule.&nbsp; This was Terrance McKenna&#039;s belief and I&#039;m sure it was his experience.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve gone right back into a DMT experience immediately after coming down.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very powerful tool.&nbsp; It opens the doors of perception.&nbsp; And your faith in it and willingness to allow the experience to be what it is without your preconceived notions are a huge part of it.<br /><br />As to SSRIs you can trip on them but you&#039;ll need a higher dose.&nbsp; DMT works on a ton of different receptors and so is something of an exception to this rule but it also works on the big receptor most other psychedelics do.&nbsp; So yeah, you&#039;ll need to smoke more then the rest of us if that&#039;s the case.&nbsp; Or at least, that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been told.<br /><br />DMT has really shown me that the universe will be what it is if you allow it.&nbsp; So maybe the SSRI thing doesn&#039;t even hold water when it comes down to it.<br /><br />Sorry if I sound like some mystical headed hippie.&nbsp; But DMT has changed my mind about a lot of things.

				I have had experiences similar to yours on my own extracted DMT. It was my first few times smoking it and it was because I was smoking it horribly wrong. I was using a foil square, then having a glass bottle broken in half on it. Put the DMT on the foil, then toke when vapor rises. If I had enough DMT, sure, it would have worked, but little did I know I was WASTING quite a bit with that method.<br /><br />Make yourself a Machine, there are wiki&#039;s and forums dedicated to DMT that have tutorials on how to make yourself one, but I will give you the rundown.<br /><br />Materials<br />- Glass Bottle<br />- Copper Scrubber<br />- Torch<br />- Glass Tube (or straw)<br />- Diamond Drillbit + drill *Optional. You can do it this way without it, it will just look better.<br />- Screw driver + hammer *That is if you don&#039;t have a diamond drillbit + drill.<br />- Duct tape<br /><br />Procedure<br />Alright. If you have a diamond drillbit, just drill a hole in the bottom of the bottle. Duct tape the glass tube so it is sealed on the hole. You will want to burn the copper scrubber until it stops smoking, to get off whatever they coat it in. When it stops smoking you should be good. You may want to clean it with warm soap and water also to get the black stuff off.&#039;<br /><br />So just have the amount of DMT you want to consume (You can blast off with 25-50 MG DMT with this method) and rub the scrubber on it, it should pick it up easily. Put the flame on a tail of the copper scrubber so the DMT melts into it. Stick the scrubber DMT side into the mouth hole of the glass bottle. Light the TAIL end (FLAME ONLY TOUCHES TAIL) and hold it there until vapor rises, then take the flame away. Keep toking and take a large first rip. Then re-light if needed and take another big hit. Remember to hold those hits in for quite a bit. You should be well on your way after you take in that second rip so set the pipe down. BLAST OFF!

				I&#039;m pretty sure my next purchase is going to be some DMT from rogerpete. I&#039;m just wondering if anyone has any dosage recommendations for a first timer. Just FYI though... I&#039;m looking for an out of this world, life changing trip. Maybe this isn&#039;t recommended for a first time DMT user, but I really need a therapeutic trip to point my life in the right direction. Any suggestions are more than welcome.<br /><br />I&#039;m very experienced with LSD and reasonably experienced with psilocybin and MDMA just to give a little background. I can generally handle VERY large amounts of drugs....

Get some weed, place in a pipe, and put a thick, wide layer of DMT, on top of the weed. Take a huge rip, and hold it, as long as you can, exhale, then quicly take another huge rip, and hold it, by then you should enter the matrix... ;D ;D ;D

Only smoke it...<br /><br />Go outside, somewhere with grass, and trees, with beautiful view. And set a chair outside and sit down. You most likely drop the bowl, after the second hit.<br />

Just pour it over the bowl, alot, and you are set. You cant overdose on this stuff, so you are safe, more the better.

No euphoria, there is no come up, You take one, two hits, and you are Gone.<br /><br />3. Yes on small hits, you are still there, in This world, but everything becomes a cartoon, really... Some South Park episode stuff.... Its like your mind is creating a videogame :)<br /><br />4. yes setting is everything and nothing. I seriously prefer being outside, on a chair, with green forest trees, on a sunny day. You can do it everywhere, but thats just me..<br /><br />5. Last time I did DMT, the music on the radio, made me cry...seriously... Its like it touched my soul, I had a tears running down my face... But thats because I didnt break through, I was still in this world..<br /><br />6. Yes, it feals like the best dream in the world. Thats exactly what it feels like...<br /><br />7. Cant make you crazy, its very harmless for mind and body... its&nbsp; in you in small amounts too, and animals.<br /><br />8. No, dont do small amounts. Just jump in! Huge rips, and you will love it. Nothing to be afraid of...<br /><br />9. I have never done LSD, so I have no clue, or resemblance to DMT.

A lot of people have trouble breaking through for quite a while. Some (me for instance) have no desire to do it. Honestly the experiences I&#039;ve had, while in many ways positive, have scared me pretty thoroughly. My experience with the ineffable, mystical, scary side of psychedelics has taught me to take things slowly and in small pieces. <br /><br />You pose a number of excellent questions which I&#039;ll address individually:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have a few questions about DMT for the seasoned users - <br />is there a general feeling of euphoria associated with the come up (similar to LSD )?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes. For me it&#039;s unlike LSD, at least to some extent. It&#039;s more intense, sometimes to the point of being uncomfortable. Like light filling me up so fast I can barely stand it. Not wholly unpleasant, just intense. Smaller doses are more enjoyably euphoric. I also get weird sensations in my teeth. Stronger doses feel like they&#039;re shattering in my mouth. Again, I wouldn&#039;t describe this as unpleasant. This sort of extends back into my soft palate and into my sinuses. I&#039;ve found that a few small doses of DMT can clear up a stuffed up nose.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">on smaller doses, do you still possess the feeling of the &quot;self&quot;, i e, do you feel like it is YOU (your ego / consciousnes ) that is having the experience? Or is there some sort of dissociation from the ego even on lower doses?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I always have, except for the first time I did it. It wasn&#039;t a breakthrough experience, but it was damn close. Most of my negative DMT experiences have been the result of me thinking I&#039;ve smoked to much and desperately trying to hold on to my ego. This is part of the reason I&#039;m not in any hurry to get a breakthrough dose. I don&#039;t want to go into it kicking and screaming. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">how does set and setting affect a trip of such a (relatively) short duration? Is it sufficient to have music playing and some nice lighting around you indoors ( like in a room ) as opposed to outdoors?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />As much as with any other psychedelic. Don&#039;t forget that while &quot;set&quot; refers in part to how you&#039;re feeling at that particular moment or for the days and weeks leading up to a trip, it also describes your whole psychological profile, from birth to present. Some people, IMO are going to have a more difficult time with entheogenics just because of who he/she. Because of the velocity and intensity of DMT, I think it&#039;s easier to have negative experiences with. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does it feel like a dream when you come out?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />It depends on the dose. My highest doses have left me with an utter lack of understanding w/r/t the world I reemerge. While the drug wears off, things I was doing an hour ago seem strange and distant. If you blast of entirely I imagine coming back to this world would far stranger. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can it potentially make you crazy?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is a very interesting question, one that probably deserves it&#039;s own thread. The short answer is no. Nothing can &quot;make&quot; you crazy. What we typically think of as insanity (at least in the context of the question) is very complicated and the result of a multitude of factors. It&#039;s basically what I was getting at with what I said about Tim Leary&#039;s notion of set. It CAN, however, fundamentally change the way you look at reality. People react to this shift in different ways and for some it can be difficult. The thing about it is you&#039;ll never know unless you try it, and once you&#039;ve tried it, you can&#039;t unlearn what you&#039;ve learned. <br />For me, it has been difficult, but for the most part I&#039;d say I&#039;m doing alright. I have a good friend who isn&#039;t. DMT has taught me, more than anything, that you can&#039;t rely on others (as in any human being who has ever lived) for answers to life&#039;s ultimate question. There are some helpful suggestions, but in the end nobody knows. It&#039;s a hard lesson to learn, but it&#039;s helped me, if not let go, than relax a little bit when facing the mysteries of the universe.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">should i approach it slowly (start with 5mg, move on to 10, 15, 20, and so forth ) till i feel comfortable with the intensity?<br />any other advise would be greatly appreciated.

				I had my first DMT-smoking-experience yesterday, <br />had lots of difficulties finding it on the local markte an didn&#039;t want to try it from SR the first time...so it took me almost 2 years before finding it around here. That&#039;s ok, most of that time was also used as a &quot;preparation&quot; for the experience and I believe such thing&#039;s shouldn&#039;t be forced - it comes when the time is right. <br /><br />I went &quot;up&quot; three times in 10 minutes. <br />The first one was only light visuals, no trip. <br />The second was a &quot;cartoon-ish&quot; visual in trip, very light. I could see the &quot;door&quot; in the distance, but was not able to go in that direction...still, it felt like &quot;coming home&quot;, very pleasant and relaxing. Maybe 2, 3 minutes or so. I also felt the presence of an &quot;entity&quot;, but couldn&#039;t really see him - it&#039;s more like I could see him because he made a little discrepancy in what I was seeing - he stood &quot;behind&quot; the cartoonish visuals... a small, fat man pointing at me and laughing... I&#039;m not shure if he was laughing at me or with me, but he wasn&#039;t scary or violent or agressive or whatever... so no worries there and I&#039;ll probably be seeing him again pretty soon. <br />The third was similar to the first. <br /><br />But, I felt like my lips were burned where I had put the straw... so I guess I burned the stuff...<br />After that, I &quot;prepared&quot; it for a friend, whose lips didn&#039;t burn at all - so I guess I didn&#039;t burn his stuff...that&#039;s a good sign: I&#039;m learning&nbsp; :D<br />(I&#039;m using a glas chemical tube with a cork on it, 2 holes in the cork and a straw in 1 of those 2 holes)<br /><br />Will do it again with a more experienced friend. <br />Hope he&#039;ll show me &quot;the way&quot;. <br /><br />But, damn, that stuff really runs away from the heat - I did my research and was prepared for it, but I didn&#039;t expect it to be running away so quickly and so hard.

				I too am also looking to experience my first DMT trip soon, am waiting for a bit of money to come in and then i shall purchase some from SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading tons of trip reports from bluelight, its a great forum for finding links on all sorts of drug reports/trip reports. <br /><br />Have a look in trip reports they&#039;re usually a couple of DMT reports lurking around.<br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/forums/40-Trip-Reports

				I&#039;ve been very interested in trying some DMT for a long time now. I&#039;ve not purchased any yet however as I&#039;m looking to get a bit more experience with psychedelics like LSD first, I will be tripping next this weekend.<br /><br />Basically I just want to say thanks to everyone who&#039;s posted in this thread, it&#039;s been very informative and helpful. There are quite&nbsp; few things I either didn&#039;t know or I&#039;ve received bad info from somewhere and you guys have helped clear them up for me.

				Just another question... I know it was suggested that I just mix it in with weed, but I can easily get one of those freebase pipes with the big sphere on the end. I was wondering if there are some who think using this would me more efficient.

				The anti-depressants (SSRI&#039;s) thing is 100% true.<br /><br />If you are on prozac or anything in that class your trip will be 10-20% of what it would normally be.<br /><br />If you want something psychedelic Ketamine will work no problem, although it&#039;s a different experience.<br /><br />Also do not try and go cold turkey off your SSRI&#039;s to have a good DMT trip.&nbsp; The withdrawal symptoms will make your trip evil and scary.<br /><br />

				i did 5-meo-dmt. small dose. nasal.

				If it tastes like burnt plasticy death it&#039;s smoke and you&#039;re burning it.<br /><br />If it tastes like a waxy plastic it&#039;s vapor.<br /><br />You can certainly burn it without touching a flame to it.

				A trick that I use is to cover the airholes (light globe based pipe) with 2 fingers while heating, keep them there even as the vapour starts forming until the globe is completely opaque, then remove both fingers and start inhaling while still heating.&nbsp; After 300+ trips that would still make me break through from a single inhalation.

				i broke through the first time i tried it.&nbsp; i just loaded a big pile into a meth pipe, exhaled hard, and just inhaled for about 40 seconds straight while holding a torch under the bulb.&nbsp; obviously i burnt the shit out of it, but boy did i trip out hard!&nbsp; it was exhilarating and very intriguing, so i repeated that procedure later that day.&nbsp; <br /><br />well, a week later i had a really strong acid trip that played heavily on the mystery of what happened during my DMT trips.&nbsp; well, to make a long trip-story short, i totally unraveled and devolved into a purely paranoid schizophrenic state.&nbsp; it took months and months to recover from that trip.&nbsp; and really i haven&#039;t been the same since.<br /><br />after about 5 years of obsessing over these events i started wanting to want to try DMT again, but it was hard.&nbsp; one of the first times i tried to pick up the pipe again and do it i got the shakes so bad that I couldn&#039;t properly do it and had someone else hold the lighter for me.&nbsp; obviously i only smoked a little bit and called it off.<br /><br />then i got smart and got a glass vapor genie.&nbsp; i had no idea you could experience DMT without feeling like you&#039;re suffocating on melted plastic.&nbsp; so that was step one.&nbsp; then i realized that smoking just a little DMT is wonderful, euphoric, titillating, and refreshing.&nbsp; it also tempts you to keep going and do more.<br /><br />Its been a lot of fun getting into DMT for real this time.&nbsp; i don&#039;t do more than i can handle, but am getting more and more comfortable adjusting to the space it puts you in.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyway, DMT is great, just don&#039;t get cocky with it.&nbsp; it can and will blow your mind apart if you bite off more than you can chew.&nbsp; but if you respect it and take your time it is a truly beautiful thing

				Eep. Thanks, Joey Terrifying. I&#039;ve been hanging back waiting for a good time to get into the DMT, and was wondering about effects of other recent psychs interacting (in this case one of the NBOMe but more likely on other days LSD). <br /><br />Do people advise waiting out typical psych tolerance periods (1 or 2 weeks) before DMT, or was that just a case of too much too hard along with the acid, JT?

				OK - so snorting is an option, but it hurts as hell...<br /><br />so here&#039;s the question: did anyone try snorting DMT together with something else (such as coke) to have less pain, <br />or tried to snort it just after another line from something else (again, I&#039;m mainly thinking about C). <br /><br />Does it help? <br />Would it help? <br />Any suggestions? <br /><br />

				Any of the &#039;caines should theoretically work, cocaine/lidocaine etc.&nbsp; Essentially, any local anesthetic that would not damage soft tissue, and can be snorted.<br /><br />That being said, I really don&#039;t see the point in snorting DMT.(or 5-meo-DMT)&nbsp; One of the best parts of the trip is the takeoff, given the slower absorption rate from insufflation, I can&#039;t see it being anywhere near as good.&nbsp; Added to that, the decrease in bioavailability from that particular ROA, makes me less willing to consider it.<br /><br />

				So I have to say I&#039;m a little bit let down. Today I got the chance to try this drug for the first time, along with two friends. A little background info -<br /><br />This took place midday, outside, and in a calm environment. The last drug I used (not cannabis) was 25C NBOMe a good month ago. We used a wooden VaporGenie purchased specifically for DMT. For each of us, a thin layer of mint was put on top of three screens followed by 50mg of DMT. Me being much more experienced with psychedelics than them, we agreed that I would take a turn watching over them and once they came down they&#039;d watch over me. <br /><br />Okay. Friend one takes one big-ass puff, forces another one off the residue down, and is knocked on his ass. Got a bit windy at this point so friend two struggled with his first hit but on the second was also knocked on his ass. They started coming down maybe ten minutes later apparantly having the most intense experience of their lives. All friend one could manage for the next ten minutes was &#039;holy shit&#039; while friend two just laughed in disbelief. My turn! I decide I want to &#039;smoke&#039; it so I take the pipe&#039;s top compartment off, load up my 50mg and light up, making sure not to touch the DMT with the flame. I wait until the DMT disappears, only a little residue was left on the leaf. I hold in my hit for as long as possible and exhale. Almost immediately I have a rushing sensation throughout my whole body. I decide to load up another 20mg or so for kicks and breathe that in as well. These two consecutive hits took place within a minute. I layed back on my blanket and waited. All I can really describe was my breathing becoming inaudible as well as my heartbeat racing. The sky turned ever so slightly red and &#039;melty&#039;. That was the extent of my five minute &#039;trip&#039;, followed by a good half hour of euphoria and wonder.<br /><br />Congrats! You&#039;ve read my book. I now want to know what I did wrong. Let me stress that I was not unaffected by this substance - it&#039;s just that my experience was no where near what I&#039;ve read and what my friends were attempting to describe and I&#039;m quite let down. I was very careful not to burn the DMT and we all determined that I indeed hadn&#039;t. According to erowid, I had 10mg over what is considered a strong dose of this substance and I know for a fact my scale is accurate. Did they have their breakthroughs because they vaped and I decided to just use the bottom half of the genie? Is there a better technique than just taking my full hits and setting the pipe down? Was my experience normal and you kind of just have to get lucky with the breakthroughs as I&#039;ve read in some locations? Should I maybe just try reloading it up until I&#039;m physically unable to take another hit and drop the pipe? Thanks a lot guys, answers in the next two days before I try again would be wonderful.

				My first breakthrough was off one big hit.&nbsp; It&#039;s very important to make sure you&#039;re vaping the DMT and not burning it.&nbsp; The best way to tell this is by the taste (if it tastes like burnt plasticy death you&#039;re doing it wrong).&nbsp; Just because you didn&#039;t touch the flame to the DMT doesn&#039;t mean you didn&#039;t burn it.&nbsp; The shit&#039;s barely solid at room temperature and vaporizes at like 200f I believe.<br /><br />When you get the big one you&#039;ll know it.&nbsp; It&#039;s like smoking weed or anything else.&nbsp; When you get that hit that you know is going to put you on your ass you know long before you exhale.<br /><br />For me I just hit it hard.&nbsp; I loaded a good amount, held my lighter where it needed to be, and inhaled deeply.<br /><br />A lot of Terrance McKenna wisdom gets passed around in the DMT community but that was what worked for him.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned I need to disregard everything he said and figure it out for myself because that&#039;s life.<br /><br />Anyway keep at it.&nbsp; I probably went through a half a gram if not more before I had my first breakthrough.&nbsp; I had some crazy unexplainable experiences along the way for sure and I wasted a lot of DMT at the beginning by burning it.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s just how it goes for most people.<br /><br />Play around with it until you find your own sweet spot and your own method.
