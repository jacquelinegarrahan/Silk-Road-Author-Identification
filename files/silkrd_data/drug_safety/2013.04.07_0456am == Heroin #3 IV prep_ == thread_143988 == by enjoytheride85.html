				Would anyone with experience in IV use of Heroin #3 care to share how they prep it safely? I know you need to use vitamin C or citric acid... but how much? And is this prep really hard on the veins - I imagine it would be (considering the resultant pH).&nbsp; Maybe I should just smoke this stuff...?

				OK I did this in the heroin thread but for you I&#039;ll say it again<br /><br />#3 is more alkaline than #4 and has trouble dissolving in water, so for a 100mg shot a small (0.01g) of citric acid (from the supermarket) OR 4-5 drops of lemon juice will allow the stuff to<br />dissolve with a bit of heat!<br /><br />&nbsp; Citric acid is very mild and the small amount used (roughly 1/10th the amount of gear) should see you fine ;)<br /><br />With lemon juice, MAKE SURE you use a freashly cut slice of lemon (cut with a CLEAN KNIFE..unless you want to risk a dirty shot&nbsp; :o ) and just squeeze a few drops in ...some dope might need a little nore, some a little less<br /><br />After a mild heating, NO BOILING is necessary, the solution should become &quot;clear&quot; (grey brown pink!&nbsp; YES I&#039;ve seen &quot;pink rocks&quot;) and then you filter it and you are good to go ;D<br /><br /><br />BTW&nbsp; the tiny amount of fluid, acidic or otherwise (as long as it&#039;s &#039;clean&#039;) will not cause you ant heath problems<br /><br />WARNING:&nbsp; I do NOT suggest using anything but #4 for IM&nbsp; aka&nbsp; &quot;intra muscular&quot; injections .... your blood has the most &quot;immune cells&quot; in it and will beat any shit faster than if it goes into a muscle&nbsp; or under the skin (skin popping)&nbsp; <br /><br />Do your very best to keep EVERYTHING clean/new and you should enjoy a lovely warm rush from good gear&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I hope this helps ..... pm me for info IF&nbsp; you need it!

Abscorbic acid (Vit C) is the least damaging to veins, one draw back is that one can often get a hive like reaction around the injection site (like a nettle sting) it seems to be harmless though, and disappears in an hour or less, citric is a stronger acid- does more damage, with citric, use less than a tenth of the amount of H- better to add less- then add tiny bit more if everything does not dissolve- you get to know through experience, what is undissolved H and what is bash, that won&#039;t ever dissolve. With Vit C start with about a quarter of the amount of H, and aslast poster said- never boil the solution- the heat will degenerate the heroin, you want more of a light simmer- if that, basically, just enough to dissolve the H- you should be using sterile water before, and don&#039;t share spoons, or if you have to, wipe well with an alcohol wipe before
