				im bored shitless and have nothing at all to kill it so im going to do a CWE from some paramol, ive done it before with codeine (despite my constant worry that it left some paracetemol behind, and it didnt kill me so it cant be too bad) just wondering what the dosage for DHC is? my last codeine one was quite a while ago and if im right it was somewhere around the 240mgs mark and was somewhat dulled by the caffeine in the pills, just wondering what the dosage should be roughly for DHC and aslo if it needs to go through first pass metabolism before becoming active like codeine does or can i use cy p450 inhibitors like tonic water and white grapefruit with it (they hinder the mechanism of codeine) also be aware that ill likely be popping a 2mg clonazepam too<br /><br />oh and one more thing, a question on filters, most people use coffee filters, i however dont (i make my coffee with an espresso machine) but thanks to my youthful nerdyness i do still have some lab grade &quot;fine crystal&quot; filters, i have used coffee filters before but they seem to leave the final product looking a little milky which bothered me, with the lab filters it comes through clear but am i losing any of the good stuff like that or is it totally water soluble and as long as the liquid comes through then what i want is still in there.<br /><br />forgive my ignorance if i should know this already but opiates are generally my last port of call when i got nothing else so i cant say im massively experienced with it, normally id just buy some j collis brownes or something but that means a walk into town that i cant be bothered with today<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />well im halfway through the first filtering, liquid is coming out completely clear, im not sure if thats a good or a bad thing but i guess ill know soon enough, once the first filter is done ill cool it again and refilter just to be sure, but just in case i fucked up somehow and im dead come the morning youll know why im not posting anymore :P<br /><br />and whilst im thinking about death i dont know about anyone else but i personally wish there was a way that when i die all posts ive ever made on any forum or board anywhere could be deleted, im the kind of person who wants to be forgotten when i die, there will be no funeral, no obituary and no grave. man people are going to be so pissed off reading my will, i got bugger all to leave to anyone but a list of requests/demands!
