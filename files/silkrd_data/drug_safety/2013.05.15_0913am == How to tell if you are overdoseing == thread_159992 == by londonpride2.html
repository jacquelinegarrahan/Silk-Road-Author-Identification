				How do you tell if you are overdosing on an opiate? Will you just black out?<br /><br />Sometimes I find its slightly hard to breath but I think that might just me be paranoid/over aware of my breath.<br /><br />Probably a stupid question but advice would be most welcome.

				Not too stupid of a question, thing is, you wont be able to tell if you OD&#039;d on H or w.e until its too late..<br /><br />Typically opiate over doses are when an individual does too much, eventually just nods out, never to wake up. <br /><br />EDIT; try not to focus too much on your breathing, as this usually leads to hyperventilation syndrome. What you can do, when not high, is practice breathing exorcises, to better be able to control your breaths.

				LOL<br /><br />Yea OP, Im not expert, but i do believe thats how it goes.<br /><br />Ive taken lots of opiates in my day, and the only ODs i would ever hear about, is heavy heroin users, that OD by doing their &#039;normal&#039; dose, with a new batch of H. <br /><br />Always go easy when doing different dope. What you consider to be good stuff, may take 2 bags or how ever much to get you stoned, that same dose on another bag can kill you. Always start light. Feel out the gear, and work your way up.

If it is just a little, you have a small margin in which you can understand you are going in dangerous territory (i.e. you cannot stay awake and are going down to sleep, that means death if somebody is not there).<br /><br />It also depends on administration. With IV and a large OD you don&#039;t either acknowledge it. You do it, you fall unconscious, you are dead.<br /><br />With routes that are less direct (as oral administration) instead you can feel you are about to nod-off and that should be an alarm (but, again, it depends on the amount of OD; if it is large you will simply blackout and goodbye).<br /><br />I OD only once in H, snorting it (it was the beginning when I was still not doing IV and luckily I&#039;m out now of those black days) and I could feel I was going to fall unconscious (my eyes felt very heavy, my breath was very shallow etc.), only that I stupidly thought I could &quot;master&quot; it by simply forcing me to stay awake by walking and talking. I was wrong. Luckily I had a friend that called an ambulance when I did fall unconsciousand I&#039;m here now for this. If I was alone I would have died.

				If you go over when injecting, if you are lucky, you will wake up with a blinding headache, unsteady on your feet, with the syringe still stuck in your arm. If you aren&#039;t lucky, don&#039;t sweat it- you will be dead! lol. Usually, you will loose consciousness first, before your breathing is affected, if you have no tolerance, you really should not be injecting because there is a lot smaller window for a recreational dose- ie. it is easier to go over. When you have a tolerance, you have more leeway in your dosage. If you are a novice injecting, you should certainly have a mature, level-headed friend with you, who won&#039;t leave you to die if you go over, but knows what to do!

				Some medical professionals deem &quot;overdose&quot; as any experience that is unpleasant. This is too broad in the sense of recreational drug use, I think.<br /><br />An overdose is the point at which your body goes into shock: drop in BP, elevated HR (&gt;160-180 BPM), seizure, loss of consciousness, confusion--beyond the effects of hallucinogens... stay away from Datura products, or unexplained and unwanted symptoms.<br /><br />Alcohol is the best teaching tool for understanding an overdose. <br /><br />Drink too much = pass out/black out = overdose. <br /><br />Drink too much = vomit = overdose.<br /><br />Drink too much = stomach ache = overdose.<br /><br />Drink too much = become aggressive/violent = overdose.<br /><br />Drink too much = Don&#039;t drink too much!

				Yea man you are buggin... Honestly I had a nurse about 5 years ago at a methadone clinic/ detox center tell me that if done with any smarts what so ever heroin via snorting is one of the safest drugs unless you pull some Pulp Fiction... first sign you did too much will be the fact that you will be throwing up a lot... don&#039;t get me wrong I throw up all the time and I have a huge tolerance and it doesn&#039;t mean you are OD&#039;ing but they actually do by definition considering that slight Overdose but you will be fine.... I almost always throw up when I get my hands on some good dope because I always love to NOD and that sometimes takes a lot and combined with the cigs I get nauseous... so unless you are sick like a dog and can&#039;t stop throwing up then don&#039;t even think about the word OD because that would for sure be happening bro!&nbsp;
