				Hey guys!<br /><br />A quick question for those who have had the pleasure of trying and comparing both.&nbsp; In all my 7 years of chipping h I&#039;ve only had access to black tar due to geographical location, however since some have been having success with getting powder vi SR I think I might give it a shot finally.<br /><br />So my question for those who have tried both is how does the potency compare between the two?&nbsp; I know it will vary greatly between cuts etc but say on a per point basis would you say that one is definitely better than the other?<br /><br />I&#039;ve certainly heard that tar is the trash of H so I would be very excited to see just how much more enjoyable it can get.<br /><br />Thanks guys!&nbsp; :)

				I have been chipping on both.<br />Where I come from we call it brown and white.<br />I smoke the brown and insuflate the white, and I like both.<br />Brown is not thrash heroin and speed is not thrash coke - some LE propaganda moron invented those terms.<br />White is suitable for shooting, while brown is not, and shooting is pretty good - i have heard, but I know nothing about it, have never tried it.<br />If you are not IV&#039;ing, you are not really missing something.<br />On the other hand, I have insuflated some pretty good white stuff, expensive also...<br />I would try it, if I were you, but I wouldn&#039;t chase it...<br />Hope that helps...<br />

				Welcome to SR!&nbsp; First off, a recommendation of a great &#039;normal&#039; website for any matters opiate/H related is opiophile.org...it will bounce you to forums.opiophile.org, if I remember right.&nbsp; Great site, good, understanding people, and they know everything about all this.<br /><br />My own take is always going to be pro-powder.&nbsp; It&#039;s just real H to me, no comparison.&nbsp; *Especially* if you are injecting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen twice now, the ravages of this sort of skin eating crap that can hit you if you *miss* tar...these guys had their arms bandaged all the time, and it was gross/gruesome to see what it had done...<br /><br />The other, I&#039;ve only heard about, but way too many credible stories of amputatons due to tar...and most of us have found out the hard way that it all too quckly destroys veins; they&#039;re gone, never come back.<br /><br />That&#039;s the negative, and it&#039;s just one opinion.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had powder heroin in vietnam and in thailand, and it was&nbsp; pure, no cooking, perfect high.&nbsp; <br /><br />Trouble is, in US, in past 20 years or so, the mexican cartels have just driven out the old powder sellers, and you are stuck with tar.&nbsp; Many, who&#039;ve been around a while, just will not &#039;fix&#039; it...plugging is what works best, but it&#039;s just too nasty to describe...again, go to opiophile for details ;)<br /><br />Quality is where there is plenty of room for argument: I&#039;ve had really good, strong tar, and really cut-to-shit powder.&nbsp; But any port in a storm.&nbsp; And I remember when tar first hit up in chicago area, and some of my buds preferred it to powder, said it was stronger.<br /><br />I&#039;m a powder guy, in most areas, it wins, hands down.&nbsp; Colombians do make good powder, and I can&#039;t for the life of me understand why the cartels don&#039;t just get a colombian chemist to show them how to make it.<br />But, just opinion...

				Yeah, I only IV tar about 15% of the time or less just because it is so horrible for your veins.&nbsp; Unfortunately that does also mean not getting as good of a high.<br /><br />That seems to be about what I expected.&nbsp; Thanks for the info and the welcome, I&#039;ll for sure be checking out opiophile.
