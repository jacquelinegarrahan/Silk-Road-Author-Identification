				okay, so lets say you had something very potent and concentrated for sale. something that should NOT be in the hands of someone who didnt know what they were doing.<br />this person assures you that all is okay, pays for it and you ship the item. that person now informs you they intend to use this item to commit suicide, now what?

				Not much you can do here. If you are still in contact, try to dissuade them obviously, but you are (assuming) not a professional psychologist. Perhaps send them some online resources that could help out, like http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch

				You shouldn&#039;t feel guilty whatsoever, had you had knowledge prior to selling to him/her I&#039;m sure you wouldn&#039;t have. Unfortunately there is not much you can do

				If you really wanted to do something, you could call the police from a payphone.&nbsp; Tell them nothing, obviously, except for the fact he&#039;s a friend.&nbsp; Might be too risky if you don&#039;t want the possibility of your relative location revealed.<br /><br />Just a thought.

				If I made up my mind to die, I would not want others butting in. His life might truly suck and stopping him may just be like torture. You didn&#039;t sell it with that knowledge, so youre straight. Just try to understand how dude feels, he might be ready to die.

				I don&#039;t mean to sound cold here, but it sounds to me like he is trying to guilt you for some reason, maybe for free product? Or maybe just a cry for attention. If I was going to kill myself with drugs I bought from SR, I would never message the vendor I bought them from and tell him, that&#039;s just low. Why would anyone want their last act on earth to be making someone else feel miserable in guilty? I doubt this person actually plans on committing suicide, most people who are legitimately suicidal keep it to themselves.<br /><br />

				If I went to a gun store, bought a gun, and killed myself, would the gun store clerk be responsible? No. Would they FEEL responsible, more than likely. That&#039;s a asshole move to do that, stupid people are stupid.

				&quot;I have explained the only valid reason existing against suicide on the score of mortality. It is this: that suicide thwarts the attainment of the highest moral aim by the fact that, for a real release from this world of misery, it substitutes one that is merely apparent. But from a mistake to a crime is a far cry; and it is as a crime that the clergy of Christendom wish us to regard suicide.&quot;<br /><br />Arthur Schopenhauer

				Hated Patriot totally nails it.&nbsp; You see when people are depressed and want attn they often play the suicide card.&nbsp; In college I minored in psyche and worked a 24 hr crises hotline. We had to go through a 16 hour training session put on by a local University in coalition with 911 / emergency services city of _________, 3rd highest suicides per capita in the country at that time.&nbsp; Very very rarely when someone is truly suicidal do they think hmmmmm, i guess I should call the crises line (or email this seller at SR) before I do this.&nbsp; lol kinda funny when think about it.&nbsp; Some cities have put in suicide phones on major bridges now.&nbsp; The idea is right before people jump they will pick up that phone and call.&nbsp; I suppose it helps people get into treatment for major depression but I really dont think a suicide minded person thinks ok, lets see, i am ready to jump now but gotta pick up that phone and call it in.....
