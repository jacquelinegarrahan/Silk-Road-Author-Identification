				I have to snort 30mg of roxy to get where I want(pretty f&#039;d up). I tried a 40mg morphine once(so I was told) orally and it didn&#039;t do shit to me. I would have rathered just went with the roxy but the 30mg morphine was so much cheaper.<br />So the question is do I crush it and parachute it or snort it? I&#039;d appreciate answers from people who actually know what they&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Eat it, it has an extremely low oral bioavailability, only 30% if I remember correctly, but it&#039;s even worse to snort it. The only shit you&#039;ll feel is the stuff that falls back down your throat. By far the most effective way is plugging it, if you&#039;re down with that. It&#039;s the most bang for your buck, so to speak. Shooting is virtually impossible to do safely so that&#039;s out of the question.<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely one of the weaker opiates when taken orally. Btw I think 60mg is a safe first dose, you might as well double it next time if you have enough. It won&#039;t feel like 30mg of Roxy but it&#039;s not bad.

				54 262 , the white round one -- I&#039;m not into IV but thanks for the tip though. <br />Oh yeah and btw Anon, a little off topic but, I hope I didn&#039;t piss you off with that whole Oliver thread, I was just honestly speaking out of experience, I ordered from him twice. I really wonder what it is, maybe my body doesn&#039;t process the powder the same way as other people, I mean I have a high tolerance too so I really don&#039;t know. <br /><br />Yeah I really wanna sniff the morph but I&#039;m worried that it&#039;s not gonna be soluble being that the sulfate is a salt...

U just spoke your feelings, cant no one fault u for that. I do the same man, I give my honest review on vendors and their products.. Im not a fake dude i keep it real and if someones product is not good im gonna say it ya know.. I respect u for voicing your thoughts man.. I just dont see how someone could do 100mg of real alrozam powder and not feel anything, let alone almost be dead.. I just think all these guys selling Alprozam powder are crushing up Xanax bars and it wouldnt take many xanax bars to = 1gram of it, and then chargin 100 buckd or 200 for a gram..&nbsp; Bro im a long time benzo user and i feel good off 1 bar to start.. So if people are sniffin 20 and more MG of it, man thats like taking 10 2mg bars.. I would be trashed..LOL<br /><br />Hang on let me look up the morh u got

				I didn&#039;t weigh out exactly 100mg.&nbsp; <br />I ordered a 1/4 gram bag for $100 and did like 30 mg(well I have a regular scale so whatever .03 on my scale actually is, idk probably not too accurate), didn&#039;t feel nothin&#039;. <br />So then I go to my buddies house the next day and split the remainder of the bag with him in half, then drank a couple 24&#039;s. He didn&#039;t get any effects. I didn&#039;t get zombied out, still had perfect motor skills, but I slept A LOT and had memory lapses the next day.<br />It tastes very similar to xanax,was definitely some sort of benzo, I really don&#039;t know what that stuff was but it was sketchy as all hell. <br />Whatever though I&#039;m pretty sure it won&#039;t kill you so it doesn&#039;t hurt to try, you just might risk losing some money.<br /><br />

				Yea 20 was to high u should of at very least got 2.. Morphine is not expensive at all.. I use to get the green ABG 200mg long ones for 60 bucks.. I would break it into 3 pieces and snort it like that.. The IR&#039;s are always good to snort.. Im sure u know but IR means INSTANT RELEASE, So if it is gonna be even more faster but crushing it.. Man those white ones are goooood!! Like i said i use to get 10 every week from someone.. I use to do 2 in the AM before work and 1 off and all all day ..LOL.. I love pain pills man and i love snorting them!! U ever got any questions PM me iv been on opiates for 10+ years dude.. I know about them all.. I got a killer Gram of #4 H monday!! 150bucks for the gram!!! New guy, I still have about 1/4 left, its some of the best iv had, i seriously cant do more than 3 shots in a day man.. Im gonna order some original OC&#039;S here soon

				Damn 10 years, every day man how do you do it, are you functioning lol? I&#039;ve been dabbling with opiates for probably 5 years, never do em more than a few times a month, I&#039;ve been tempted to grab some h because oxys are so expensive and nothing else really does it for me but them, but I&#039;m scared to cross that line between the oxys and the h. <br /><br />20mg of methadone barely even touches me. Only oxycodone seems to do the trick. I bet a 10mg bump of quality h would do me in, which is soo cheap, but I&#039;m worried about the addiction factor.

				Man that one pill broke up into a big pile, just sniffed it about 15-20 min ago. It tastes real weird and chalky, nothing like roxys. I&#039;m feeling a little air in my step but nothing crazy. Oh well I kinda knew when I ordered it it wouldn&#039;t be anything special. The writing on looked a little fuzzy too, perhaps it wasn&#039;t the freshest pill.
