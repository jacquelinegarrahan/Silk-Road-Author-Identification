				I am a casual smoker, I smoke weed 4 or 5 days a week minimum for a year or more. I got some new weed in and I immediately did not care for it that much for whatever reason. Others liked it just fine. I still smoked it and thought it was alright until yesterday when I smoked about half a 1g blunt which is not uncommon for me. I got cold, clammy, and started shaking uncontrollably. I had friends over and I had to leave to my room because I started feeling so bad. It was to the point where I started to get very worried about my health and I felt my heart racing too.<br /><br />I am in very good health and I go to the gym nearly every day. I can run for miles etc... so I know it&#039;s nothing to do with that department. Only other thing I&#039;ve taken recently has been MDMA several weeks ago and alcohol a couple times but not with the weed.<br /><br />Should I be worried? I&#039;m hoping it was just the strain and maybe changing that up will get things back to normal

				Jack,<br /><br />I think what happened was that you had too much Nicotine.<br /><br />Maybe the blunt leaf was way too saturated in Nicotine, and you got sick?<br /><br />There is no point on spraying bud with JWH.<br /><br />Low blood sugar maybe?

				My mistake on the blunt, it was actually just rolling paper so that cannot be the case.. and yeah it just didn&#039;t feel like a weed high but I have many customers and friends who said it was just fine so I do not think it was sprayed but who knows...

				yah It might just be the strain didn&#039;t work to well with you. Sounds like a panic attack almost. maybe looks for strains that are good anti anxiety.

				Think about whether you had eaten recently or were properly hydrated, or whether you might have eaten something suspect. I find that usually when my body does weird things on cannabis it&#039;s usually just heightening some other underlying issue.

				Thanks SpaceAce, it&#039;s just strange as I have no history of anxiety at all. Maybe the weed brought it out, I&#039;m definitely waiting til my new strain comes in to smoke again and hopefully all will be well

I had consumed an energy supplement several hours prior and the effects had largely worn off, but could weed possibly re-heighten the effects?

Maybe that certain&nbsp; terpene or level of terpenes in that strain reacted weird to you. could even have an allergic reaction I suppose. <br /><br />edit: fuck this broken keyboard

				Its called a whitey where I come from mate, it happens occaisonally. Usually if you&#039;ve had a break from the weed or if its some super potency stuff. You&#039;ll be fine.
