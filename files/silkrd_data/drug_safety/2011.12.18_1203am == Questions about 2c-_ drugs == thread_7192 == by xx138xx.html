				So in the past I&#039;ve done my fair share of tripping balls. I have yet to try any of the 2c series of goodies and was looking for some input from others about them.<br /><br />I used to enjoy LSD quite a bit but always had a weird natural tolerance to it causing me to have to normally take 2x the dose my friends were taking to get similar effects which just wouldn&#039;t be cost effective at current SR LSD prices. Which of the 2c chemicals would offer the closest experience to LSD? I used to take LSD and intentionally think through some seriously challenging stuff (both personal and intellectually) because of the feeling I&#039;d have the day afterwards that reminded me of feeling revived as if my stress responses had been reset.<br /><br />I&#039;m also open to experiencing different kinds of trips at this point. A stint in the Army left me with PTSD and after reading up on the usage of hallucinogens in experimental treatments for it, I think it&#039;s time for some mind and reality expansion so any suggestions and/or information would be appreciated.

				2c-P is super intense, 2C-I is moderate, and 2c-E is pretty good too:) They all make you trip balls, but 2c-P is intense as HELL! As far as the closest, I thought 2C-I was closest to LSD but nothing compares to good old LSD ha. They are all fun, moderation though. 2C-E is also nicknamed psychedelic cocaine:)<br /><br />-NS<br /><br />-PM me if you have any specifc Q&#039;s, I&#039;m pretty knowledgeable:)

				In a technical sense the stomach stress is caused by the lining of your Small intestine being irritated by the substance, Because the 2c-x family of chemicals kinda works on the 5-HT axis and the small intestine is lined with receptors for 5-ht2 which is responsible for telling your brain its time to puke (releasing the stomach acid etc) and the 5-ht2 receptor is being antagonized(think tickled) by 2c-e it sends the signal to your brain saying &quot;Hey dude time to puke, I dont like all this tickling&quot;

				25mg of 2c-i is now my &quot;default&quot; trip. I have tried many 2c-xs and 2c-i is a good combination of plenty of visual activity with completely manageable body load. As far as nausea goes, if you eat some ginger (I have ginger candies) or a little bit of benadryl before ingesting the 2c-x, your stomach will thank you. Also, try to have a few hours between a big meal and ingesting 2c-x or you may get quite gassy and uncomfortable.

				2c-b is like a super trippy roll, but really mainly just very trippy.<br />2c-i is like, about an hour into a shroom trip. for 4 to 8 hours. But more stimulating.<br />2c-p is said to be like mescaline. I&#039;ve never done mescaline, but 2c-p gave me 18 hours of MAD visuals and almost ego death.<br />2c-e is a middle between em all, can be very intense at higher doses though. 25+ mg and its not easy for an unseasoned psychonaut to tell the diff between this and LSD.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7192.msg70724#msg70724">Quote from: mushkin1 on December 30, 2011, 03:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a technical sense the stomach stress is caused by the lining of your Small intestine being irritated by the substance, Because the 2c-x family of chemicals kinda works on the 5-HT axis and the small intestine is lined with receptors for 5-ht2 which is responsible for telling your brain its time to puke (releasing the stomach acid etc) and the 5-ht2 receptor is being antagonized(think tickled) by 2c-e it sends the signal to your brain saying &quot;Hey dude time to puke, I dont like all this tickling&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hahahaha, wow.

				- get the dosage guidelines for each of the 2c&#039;s you want to take, especially if moving onto NBOMe&#039;s, and summaries like the previous post are invaluable in giving<br />&nbsp; you an idea what your getting yourself into.<br />&nbsp; my readups on the 2C&#039;s and NBOMe&#039;s describe users freaking out, finding the trip way too overpowering, too&nbsp; much turning into a 3 day trip, think was<br />&nbsp; mostly NBOMe&#039;s being &quot;like Hell&quot;, excessive nasal&nbsp; bleeding -all seemed to be as a result of getting dosage wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />- 2c-t-7 -&nbsp; one chap ended up in hospital ...cardiac arrest and died (incorrect dosages!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ct7/2ct7_death1.shtml<br /><br />- NBOMe&#039;s {25x} , can be 16x stronger than the 2C&#039;s.<br /><br />

It is a great drug to just pass around as long the people you are with are used to psychedelics. No experienced psychedelic user I have given it to has ever not liked it. It is probably one of the most pleasurable 2cs and mood positive 2c. The 2c-t-x series is radically different from the 2c-x series. It is definitely something you take bumps of. Probably the best part of it is it&#039;s short duration.<br /><br />However, the dose is a tiny bump, like barely a key bump. I can&#039;t imagine what a full blown line would do to someone.<br /><br />2c-d is my favorite 2c from the 2c-x series. It is by far the most visual 2c and is the most cognitive enhancing. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7192.msg70724#msg70724">Quote from: mushkin1 on December 30, 2011, 03:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a technical sense the stomach stress is caused by the lining of your Small intestine being irritated by the substance, Because the 2c-x family of chemicals kinda works on the 5-HT axis and the small intestine is lined with receptors for 5-ht2 which is responsible for telling your brain its time to puke (releasing the stomach acid etc) and the 5-ht2 receptor is being antagonized(think tickled) by 2c-e it sends the signal to your brain saying &quot;Hey dude time to puke, I dont like all this tickling&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />2c-i can make you puke for sure. But once you puke once or twice you are gold. <br /><br />My friend once mistaked 2c-e for MXE because he thought the E on the bag was a K due to really bad handwriting of my supplier. I had left a couple of bags of psychedelics at his house. <br /><br />Him and his GF did a small MXE sized line each (still not a completely unreasonably large dose for 2c-e) and tripped like it was no one&#039;s business. He puked his brains out lol.<br /><br />He called me up and he was like, &quot;Yeah man I tried that K.&quot; I was like &quot;What K, that supplier was out of stock of MXE, I only got 2c-i and 2c-e.&quot;<br /><br />He also took a shit load of 2c-e during the Electric Zoo festival.
