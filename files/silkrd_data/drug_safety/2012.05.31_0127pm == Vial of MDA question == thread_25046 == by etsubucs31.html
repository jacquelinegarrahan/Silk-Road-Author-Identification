				Hey guys, I am thinking about trying out MDA. There are not a lot of options out there right now. davidd is offering 100mg pre-dissolved vials of 2ml of sterile distilled water. My question is do you have to inject this, or can you just drink the vial orally? Thanks for any help

				You can just drink it, but it&#039;s a little hard to suck out because the vials are so small. Using an oral syringe (which davidd offers for .99 cents) makes it a lot easier to dose. 2ml is not very much liquid! Also, they are VERY potent, I&#039;d suggest only one for a night out if you have no tolerance.

So is it something you would want to party on, or would it be better just to do with a couple friends and chill at home? Also has anyone tried his M1/MDA mixed vials. Those sound pretty interesting as well!
