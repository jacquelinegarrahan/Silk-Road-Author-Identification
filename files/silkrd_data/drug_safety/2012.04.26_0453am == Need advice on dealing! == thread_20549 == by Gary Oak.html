				Alright, so I&#039;m in a complex situation and could use the advice of some seasoned dealers.<br /><br />My sisters friend (who we&#039;ll call Sydney) has been texting me asking to buy some adderall for her and some of my old work buddies, to which I told her she can just have the rest of my supply for free. However, she then continued by asking me if I sell acid. Now I know this isn&#039;t the best situation, but I&#039;ve advertised to a few people she works with so I&#039;m not surprised she&#039;s curious. <br /><br /><br />The problem is, she&#039;s friends with a sister of mine (who we&#039;ll call Kim) who has snitched on my twice before. Kim is seriously a complete psycho bipolar bitch who thinks she knows what is best for everyone in the world. She&#039;s been nothing but trouble my whole life, and is always getting me involved with the police over these matters. I can vouch for Sydney though, as I personally know she smokes weed behind Kim&#039;s back.<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid this is a setup by Kim to get me arrested, but Sydney flat out told me to keep this a secret from her. Based on this information, would you guys give me the okay to sell this really cute girl drugs?

				Unless tail is a guarantee it&#039;s pretty hard to justify this. I seriously doubt you would have any trouble selling that acid to someone else.

That&#039;s just sleazy, and I pride myself on being a gentleman when it comes to relationships.

One of my mate&#039;s took her out before with those intentions but got completely shot down, so unless she takes the lead it&#039;s not a great idea to get sexually involved. Besides, I&#039;m currently fooling around with her friend and it would be more trouble then it&#039;s worth at the moment. :(<br /><br />Not to be rude, but your post was a little hard to interpret. So are you telling me I might as well deal to her since she&#039;s already aware?

				I would not deal to Kim or any of her friends if she has gotten you in trouble with the police multiple times over this. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I would do. I don&#039;t deal to anyone who does take drugs.

				Fuck no mega sketchy!<br />Don&#039;t even bother it&#039;s not worth it. Tell her you got bagged up or something and are out of the game. One sketchy customer is like one domino your business; it falls and everything else can collapse too.

				Either shoot or sell your sister and then you can sell to her mates all day long.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t down for murking a family member or selling one into slavery then I would just par it off mate. I know you run a business, fuck we all do but you have to balance profit and what could potentially be a huge cock-ache.
