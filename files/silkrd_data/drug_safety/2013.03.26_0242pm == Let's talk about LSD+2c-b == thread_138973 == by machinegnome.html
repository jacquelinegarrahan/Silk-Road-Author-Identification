				After chemistry class today I plan on taking 2 or 3 Gandalf blotters from JerseyCow (150ug). I also have a gram of 2c-b. The plan is to take about 20 mg 2c-b around the four hour mark of my LSD trip. This dose might seem slightly high but I enjoy a strong intensity. I would like to hear from any others that have experience taking these two wonderful chemicals together.<br /><br />Oh shit! I&#039;m late for class. Okay, get back to me my fellow travelers!&nbsp; ;D

				WOW! LSD+2c-b is an amazing combination. I took 450ug LSD+20mg 2c-b. The result was wonderful. Here it goes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3:00 pm- Dropped three Gandalf tabs (150ug). My girlfriend and I try to figure out what we will do during our trip. We decided that we wanted to be outdoors. Since it&#039;s still pretty cold where I live, I ended up gather some leaves and twigs for a camp fire. At this point we are still on the come up. The acid is kicking in. It feels great. The fire is keeping us warm even though it&#039;s only about 35 degrees outside. It&#039;s perfect. The brisk air combined with the smokey heat of the fire is amazing. I can smell the different types of wood we are burning. They each seem to have their own unique smell. The acid definitely accentuates my senses. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4:00 pm- We smoke a little weed to catalyze the intensity. We continue chatting and poking at the fire for about an hour. The visuals are starting to set in. Classic LSD visuals. Everything seems to have an interchanging purple to green tint to it. The dead grass in our back yard seems to turn into liquid as it gently ripples, and flows. I start to see hexagon patterns in the sky, and in the flames.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6:00 pm- Okay, the trip is getting to be quite enjoyable. However, I&#039;m looking to experience something a little different. Something new. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6:15pm- I weigh out 20 mg of my fluffy white 2c-b powder. I fold it up in a small piece of paper and send it down the hatch. We return to the campfire, and smoke some more weed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;approx 8:00 pm- The 2c-b starts to kick in. It&#039;s still subtle but I can already tell that it&#039;s going to be great. I noticed that my thoughts had become deep, and philosophical. I start thinking about the world as a big game. A game we all are forced to play. Also my visuals seem to have evolved. I look up at tree. It&#039;s leafless branches are slowly waving around. The air in front of me seems to have swooshes of purple, red, and green. As if the slight breeze revealed itself as these colors. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9:30- This is so fucking cool. A few friends join us at the fire. They don&#039;t know we are tripping face. It&#039;s amazing how well we are able to maintain composure. We all talk about the world, and how we are destroying our planet. We talk about our up-coming trip to NYC. I try to convince them all to do acid with me while we walk around Manhattan.&nbsp; As we are conversing I almost forget that I am tripping. It&#039;s such a comfortable trip. Once I remember to pay attention to my visuals, some very interesting things start to happen. My friend is standing in front of me. His entire body is outlined in a thin line. The line is made of color, the same interchanging purple, red, and green from before. Now it has some blue, pink, and gold it seemed like. The colors have also evolved into an electric glow. As if they were neon lights.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have to cut this off early because class is about to start. I&#039;m debating redosing today. Even though it would be kind of a waste as I would have to take at least double dose of both. I&#039;ll probably do it anyway.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I highly recommend this combination. If i could turn back time, I would have taken 35 mg of 2c-b. Maybe even 40.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for reading!
