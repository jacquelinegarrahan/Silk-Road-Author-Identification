				Hi guys.<br />Today i received some GBL vials from Amsterdope.<br />Stomach status: empty :P<br />I dosed 1ml with a syringe and put in on a glass of water... i drink it and just waited... after 1,5 hs of pure nothing (except some sleepy feeling and ass sweating lol) i decided to measure 0,5 ml and try again... But unfortunately still nothing (this second dose i took it 1 hour ago).<br /><br />So yea, my question is: what did i do wrong? Why it didnt hit me?<br /><br />Thanks.

				hmm im bumping this thread hopefully someone could answer.<br />2 possibilities i would guess: one is that gbl is diluted and the other is that you need to take more. I dont know much about gbl but when i take ghb i need at least 2 grams to feel anything

				Consumer vails are 99% ghb and 5ml.<br />Is one shot.<br />Take 5 ml ghb all in once.<br /><br />That you have to feel.<br />Time that you will be &quot;&quot;gone&quot;&quot; is short.<br />No longer then 30 minutes.<br /><br />If you think you are still able to do some grosery&#039;s shopping, be readdy to fall asleep in the supermarket.<br />Standing on your own 2 feet, thinking it was not so bad.<br />The second you wake up, you will be wondering how that could have happened...because you are not feeling anything.<br /><br />It can be tricky.<br />When you are new, you will have to feel the feeling right.<br />It&#039;s easy going from feeling a little differend, from yeh maybe a little to completely gone the next second.<br /><br />You can&#039;t drive. Even if you think you can, don&#039;t drive on ghb.<br /><br />0.5 gbl is to little. 2 ml.<br /><br />I live over there, so here in the Netherlands and see ghb all the time, but gbl never.<br />Not for consumption.<br />Only bulk usually 1000 ml or 1 liter, to make about 2 liters of ghb.<br /><br />A vail of 5 ml will knock you out for 30 minutes.<br />After 1 hour you will be sober again.<br /><br />Great drug to take a nap during lunch on the workplace.<br /><br />Gbl is not illegal,&nbsp; nor is caustic soda and DE-mineralised water.<br />All gbl are legit over here.<br />At 70 euro for 2 liter GHB you don&#039;t have to cheat for profit.<br />I mean that 70 euro you need to make the ghb, will come back in 2000 euro.<br /><br />Of every 5 euro vail of 5 ml is about 4,70 euro clean profit.<br />For 20 ml ghb you pay 10 euro over here.<br /><br />Bla bla...but the answer to your question is ; you took to little.

				Actually AmsterDope doesn&#039;t seem to be selling vials of GBL, unless he&#039;s delisted it.<br />It doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense to sell vials of GBL either, seeing as how easy it is to convert to GHB.<br />If it&#039;s indeed GHB then 2ml might indeed not be enough for you, in that case try a full 5ml vial.<br />Had it been GBL then you should definitely have felt something from 2ml..<br />If it has a salty taste, then it&#039;s probably not GBL but GHB.

				GBL actually is more potent per ml so it should have had more effect that the equivalent GHB.&nbsp; But you also really don&#039;t want to be doing GBL.&nbsp; It&#039;s really hard on your stomach (it also melts some kinds of plastics -- it&#039;s a solvent).&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to convert it to GHB which is a lot less harmful.&nbsp; In doing the conversion you end up with more grams of GHB that the GBL you started with, so it&#039;s <br />&nbsp;really what you should do with GBL.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;If you didn&#039;t get an effect from the GBL you did, I&#039;d say it was probably fake.&nbsp; It would have tasted pretty damn nasty if you were drinking straight gbl.&nbsp; And the mls you were taking, if not diluted or totally fake, would definitely have worked.&nbsp; DO NOT EVER COMBINE WITH ALCOHOL!<br />&nbsp;

				UPDATE: ok, i took 6 ml and finally hitted me. I tried 3 ml at first.. and after 45 mins of nothing, i took the other 3.

				Well I&#039;m sorry to hear your vendor was horrible with communication. If you plan to order more GHB in the future I would highly recccommend the GHB from BlueGiraffe. His GHB is spectacular! and he has a couple of threads about dosing with his GHB and other FAQ, he will usually answer within 2 or 3 days at the most. His shipping is a little slow (to the US) but his product and stealth make up for it!

				I&#039;d just like to chime in and echo the good advice about being careful with this stuff. I OD&#039;d on this a few years ago,I did too much combined with E and coke and a bit of alcohol too on a big night out,the guy who was measuring it out gave me too much basically,although ultimately it was my stupidity that caused it. I&#039;m a big boy and take responsibility for my actions.<br /><br />I was comatose for around 6 hours, I can&#039;t remember a thing of course but was told after that people were really worried about me ( not enough to take me to a hospital tho!)my breathing became very shallow apparently. A close thing really so please take care with it.<br /><br />I found out later that GBL is used as an alloy wheel cleaner,stands to reason it&#039;s not the safest thing to drink really!<br /><br />SF
