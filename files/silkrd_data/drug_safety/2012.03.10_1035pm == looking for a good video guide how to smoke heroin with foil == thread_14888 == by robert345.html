				Yeah BKind, we get it, heroin is bad, mkay.<br /><br />robert345, I&#039;ve never smoked heroin out of foil, so I can&#039;t give specific advice.&nbsp; However, the general goal is to heat the foil without actually directly applying flame.&nbsp; You just want the hot foil to heat up the heroin until it vaporizes, so you can suck the vapor into your lungs.&nbsp; If you apply flame directly, the foil or heroin could burn, ruining the product.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t find any videos, but this thread (clearnet) discusses this subject in more detail: drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=71194<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: someone in the above thread</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">chasing on foil is fine just make sure the flame doesn&#039;t burn the foil rather it should just vaporize it, do not burn it directly as this will ruin most of the high,if at all any is obtained.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sure you already know heroin is addictive and dangerous, so no lectures coming from me there.&nbsp; It should also be noted that smoking out of aluminum is bad for your health; a glass pipe (globe/crack pipe style) would be a way better method here.&nbsp; There are vendors who sell these on SR for less than $10.

				Your concern is well-founded, heroin is dangerously addictive.&nbsp; But OP already knows that.&nbsp; Everyone already knows that.&nbsp; OP asked for advice on how to do something, not on whether or not it should be done.&nbsp; Everyone has the right to make their own choices free of judgment.&nbsp; Scare-mongering videos are, in my opinion, bad form, especially on a site celebrating the freedom of choice that is drug use.

				@BKind - There are plenty of medical studies that prove nicotine is a much more addictive drug than heroin. The U.S. government never mentions the large amount of casual heroin users there are. They&#039;d rather use scare tactics than share what their own research shows. (Search engines and library databases are your friends.)<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe me - that&#039;s cool, have a fabulous day.

				Get the cheap, thin foil. Thin is the key. Don&#039;t worry about urban myths regarding smoking off foil (go ahead and research it for yourselves). It also helps to have a lighter with an adjustable flame. You will want to set it on low.<br />Rip off a large piece of foil, 6X6 is a good size. Don&#039;t let the foil get too crinkled. Place a small piece of Heroin near the outside of the foil so that it has room to run the length of the foil. I think the tube from a Bic pen is best for chasing the dragon. Cut it in half so its not too long, you will have better control over the smoke that way (a long tube swings around more). Aim your tube behind the heroin because thats where the vapor will be, and gently bring the lighter flame under the foil where the Heroin is. It will melt fast and run down the foil leaving a trail. Be gentle with the lighter, it doesn&#039;t take much heat to vaporize heroin. Just gentle taps of heat with the lighter.<br />Once you get the hang of it you&#039;ll be a pro and hardly waist a bit.

				Hey sickboy, +1 for actually providing detailed chasing instructions, unlike the rest of us! :D<br />I don&#039;t do H, so forgive my ignorance, but what is the benefit of using foil as opposed to a globe-style pipe (aside from expense)?&nbsp; When smoking hash, I&#039;ve realized using a &quot;crack pipe&quot; is often more efficient than sucking the vapors with a straw in a method similar to what you described (especially for newbs).&nbsp; In a pipe like that, I rarely lose any vapor.<br /><br />Random aside: is your name a reference to Gambino?

It is also too slow to cool off. When vaporizing heroin you only need small touches of heat. It vaporizes and melts very fast. The glass pipe would just get your Heroin smoldering away and probably just make a mess in yor pipe. Thats why I suggest the thin foil and low flame.<br /><br />The name is from &quot;Trainspotting&quot;<br />Thanx for the Karma!
