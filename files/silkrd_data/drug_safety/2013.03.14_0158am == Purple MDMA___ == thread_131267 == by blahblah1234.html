				Ordered some MDMA from a well respected vendor.&nbsp; Came in dark, almost purple colored and smelling like playdough.&nbsp; This was very unlike the tan I have had previously.&nbsp; Can anyone comment on how/why this would smell and look so purplish?&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone ever have this color or smell?&nbsp; Can you comment on the quality of your experience?<br /><br />I have to get a test kit to make sure this is real, my buddy threw ours away!!!!<br /><br />blahblah1234

				I&#039;ve seen a lot of purple MDMA. <br /><br />Now, the reason the stuff I had seen was purple was because it was brought in to the country in red wine, then re-crystalised over here. No idea about yours. But over here in the UK, most people go mad for the pink/purple stuff. <br /><br />They assume it&#039;s better quality, fuck knows - most people don&#039;t know the first thing about drugs. <br /><br />Your gear should be OK, though. Try get a test kit to be sure.&nbsp; :)

				Thanks, that&#039;s an interesting concept, how about the playdough smell?&nbsp; I did some searching and it seems common.&nbsp; I also read around that the licorice smell that I am used to may be artificially added to mask the real smell, if any.<br /><br />blahblah1234

				I&#039;ve had purple mdma twice before. I didn&#039;t ever get an explanation for it&#039;s color but it definitely had me rollin&#039; for a good 4 hours!

				purple &#039;polished&#039; should be due to the excess of the Ionian,I have often tried mdma red / purple&nbsp; and it is a bomb!!!!&nbsp; ::)<br />exists in many colors,I think sometimes add color to recognize the various lots or something

				Thanks all!!&nbsp; I taste tested a little bit and it certainly has that tang so it is at least some percentage MDMA!!!!&nbsp; I had some festie stuff last year that smelled like play-doh and it was weak so I am hoping this is as bomb as this vendor&#039;s other batches.&nbsp; Looking at the vendor reviews, I should have no issues.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />blahblah1234

				Its just food colouring. MDMA is brownish or white crystals. It has an aniseed kind of smell - I could be wrong, but I think that this is something to do with the use of safrole during the synthesis. Good pills always have the aniseed smell.

				Off topic but I once came into some blow that smelled like grape pixie sticks without the grape flavor; not sure if anyone else ate that candy when young. It was off of a trusted friend, and I thought it was fake at first, until I did a line. The stuff ended up being very strong.

				Theres two synths for MDMA; one uses PMK and the other uses safrole. I have smelt a large bag of the party flocks and they smell kind of anissed liquorice to me. It makes me gag!
