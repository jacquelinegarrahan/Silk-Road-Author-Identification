				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve still got some LSD left&nbsp; 2 x 80µg blotter and I&#039;ve got 2 x 110mg of MDMA coming in to share with a friend. Since I don&#039;t have a great deal of either I was wondering about using them together after googling I found out this is called candyflipping. I wanted to get your guys opinion on when it was best to take them, or at all?<br /><br />All opinions welcome!

				Have you ever done either in isolation before? if not, do the two tabs of acid at the same time one day, then save the MDMA for another (either two separate times, or take one then take another an hour later or at your peak of the MDMA).<br /><br />If you have already experienced the wonders of Lucy and Molly, however, then most people I know recommend Lucy first, Molly an hour or two in. It&#039;ll negate the acid trip somewhat but become an incredibly long state of euphoria.

In doing so, the LSD will have nearly (if not fully) manifested itself and will guide your MDMA peak so that they both align beautifully. I’ve stressed it before and I’ll stress it again: they key to a successful candyflip is TIMING. Why? Because you want your trip and roll to end at about the same time.

MDMA is meant to add a euphoric and positive undertone to the trip and enhance tactile and musical appreciation even further, so don’t go balls to the walls with your MDMA dose. The combination is incredibly gentle, and any worries, anxieties, or ill thoughts you think you may have will completely vanish once you finally realize just how beautiful the candyflip world is. LSD and MDMA are, in my experience, the two most synergistic substances out there. They complement each other amazingly well and the odds for a bad candyflip are close to nil.<br />

				I&#039;ve candyflipped twice but the first time was phenomenal. We were at a rave and picked up some good clean mollies, a few pills, and a few hits of liquid LSD dropped onto pieces of gum. <br /><br />I first popped the two mollies; and even was shown how the molly was small little crystals rather than powder.<br /><br />We partied and listened to the music for a bit and then about almost an hour later I popped a white gucci and it felt really clean. By an hour and 20 mins in I was Rolling nice! Close to an hour after popping the white gucci pill I finally take my hit of LSD then we left the club. The Candyflip really started hitting as soon as we got back to the house. <br /><br />I was feeling very euphoric and awesome, I was starting to get nice colorful visuals and we took a walk to the park then the foot hills to watch the sun rise. We were Candyflipping for a good 10+ hours just feeling so blissful and awesome the whole time with very nice clean visuals. <br /><br />I honestly can&#039;t wait to Candyflip again.

				Not trying to hijack!<br /><br />But im looking to candy flip this saturday at a rave but i want to add mda into the mix aswell. My normal starting dose for mdma is a .2 to .3 when i take it alone. and mda i always do with mdma at a .1 and another .1 maybe later. So i was thinking it would be good to do a .15mdma .1mda, but what i am unsure about is the lsd dosage. I have 5 200ug tabs left and i was hoping for a solid experience, but i am not sure how much to dose the lsd. I have done lsd only two times. the first being what felt weak, and the second being 120ug and not being super effective either. <br /><br />What do you think would be best dosing? thanks in advance!!!

				I also have a candyflipping question :)<br />I have a couple of Tess&#039;s tabs and 120mg of MDMA, so I&#039;m considering doing it this weekend.<br />Is the comedown from the MDMA noticeable? I feel worried that the I&#039;d crash from the MDMA and it could possible cause a bad trip or just make me feel shitty for the rest of the trip. I&#039;m not sure though..

				If somebody offered cheap domestic bk-MDMA then I would certainly give it a try and then buy more.&nbsp; It is cheap coming from China of course but I&#039;ve read about a good few seizures of methylone coming from China both on SR and in the news.&nbsp; mg for mg it isn&#039;t as potent as MDMA of course.&nbsp; Does it cause a release of serotonin or does it act directly on the serotonin receptors?&nbsp; I need to look that up.

				Tonight I&#039;ll be combining ~400ug of jesusofrave&#039;s TOC LSD, and then at T+2:00, a mixed capsule of 80mg of 3Jane&#039;s MDA and 60mg of luckylucianno&#039;s MDMA.

				Does anyone find the MDMA induced eye wobbles to be a bit more annoying while tripping on LSD and trying to enjoy the OEVs?<br /><br />I need MDMA (or MDA) to remove anxiety that I get from seemingly every other drug but I wonder if MDMA ever takes away from the LSD experience.&nbsp; Perhaps similar to zebra420kitty&#039;s question I think that at least once I&#039;d like to trip more than roll.&nbsp; But man rolling sure is nice.

				I&#039;ve never candy flipped and never heard of &quot;how to do it&quot; but I chose the majority vote. Probably because it makes sense that the LSD will last longer so you want to catch the tail end of the acid trip with the mellowing soothingness of the MDMA.

				200-300µg LSD 1.5 hours before MDMA, for a very intense and unique candyflipping experience<br /><br />I strongly suggest anyone to try both drugs out separately first, to get to know them, some people, especially new users probably can&#039;t handle the intensity of stronger LSD dose, so if you are not experienced or unsure, take less(around 100-150µg)
