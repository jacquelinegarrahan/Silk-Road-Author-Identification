				Hi all,<br /><br />Recently I purchased some Rockstar Pills with MDMA content said to be around 187mg. This is a lot stronger than any other pills I&#039;ve tried. So I have a few questions that I would like to find out for the safety of myself, my fiancee, my friends and my clients:<br /><br />1) I noticed after testing out these pills that they do not last as long as some of the other pills I have tried in the past so I had to keep re-dosing. When I tested them I knew that they were a lot stronger than anything I&#039;ve tried so I started off with only half a pill and had another half about 45 minutes later - this was good but not good enough so I took another half about 30 minutes later followed by another half about 30 minutes later. All-in-all, i took 2 pills and all seemed fine.<br /><br />2) The next night I took a full one followed by another one and then a half of one later. This was two and a half pills. Is this safe to do two nights in a row? I noticed the next night I only had two left for my fiancee and I and I got absolutely NO EFFECT from it. Is my tolerance to high now from taking the previous 4.5 pills?<br /><br />3) How many pills would I be able to take of these Rockstars before doing serious damage to my body?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />The Godfather

				You&#039;re in the process of doing some serious damage to your body.<br /><br />DO NOT take pills 1 night after the other, this is stupid and a complete waste. You need to space out your rolls, a minimum of 30 days between them is recommended. The more frequent you take MDMA the quicker you&#039;ll find your tolerance to increase and the lesser effect it will have (loss of magic).<br /><br />Anyone that consumes more than 500mg in a night, needs to rethink about what they&#039;re doing, its completely unnecessary.&nbsp;

				The second day is definitely your tolerance, you don&#039;t want to roll a second day you have to space it out with a 30 day minimum. However, i have abused MDMA alot.. i&#039;ve rolled the most 3 days in a row with some 2 days a row, and taking 6+ pills a night and double dropping.. when you abuse it, it&#039;s when you take a break from it that you start to appreciate it more. If you want to go hard one day go ahead but at your own risk, but don&#039;t try to roll a second day it will fuck up your tolerance.. and always space it out. I don&#039;t know if doing it this much caused damage to my body, but at the beginning of my break i would have problems concentrating and horrible sleep problems, but after a while it goes away. <br /><br />You don&#039;t want to do too much MDMA, you WILL lose the magic.. and always having to re dose.

				I abused MDMA in my mid-to-late teens when I sold Es. Ruined it for me for a long time but I stopped using it for well over 2 years and then I got the magic back. <br /><br />Don&#039;t make the mistake of those that had to &quot;Get the magic back&quot; and if you are out two days on the trot just switch to something else. Say Meph or Bing. If you hit MDMA to much and loose the magic then you will definitely regret it. I missed it so much while I had a break from it. Now I make sure I have breaks like I should have before. <br /><br />I&#039;d say if you leave it 2-3 weeks you&#039;ll be on track. :)

				In the late 90&#039;s when them mitsubishis came around my friend and I were eating 10-20 each over a weekend for several months before we went through 100 pack between 3 people in 3 days and we&#039;re all still alive. I&#039;m not suggesting you do this but I&#039;m just fine... I did lose the magic though&nbsp; and just started getting it back into mdma from a 10 year break, and the magic&#039;s back!<br /><br />I was young and dumb, learned a lot since then and wouldn&#039;t abuse it&nbsp; like that again.

				It all depends on the pill I suppose but I&#039;ve seen people go through tens of sketchy pills in a night. I&#039;ve also heard of people who tried ecstacy when they were young not knowing their antidepressants make it not work, and they kept taking more and more, upwards of twenty pills.

				Ecstast is a great drug, I understand your craving for more. It is the most blissful effect in the world. But.<br /><br />You&#039;re not respecting the drug you&#039;re taking. Ecstasy is not a drug you take every day, every week or every month. When you use it you expend a backup resource of hormones (serotonin), generally it takes months to fill itself up again. When you take a lot in a short time the drug will hardly effect you because you&#039;re out of serotonin. When you persist to drain your stockpiles your brain chemistry will change, eventually leading to serotinin syndrome. You really don&#039;t want your brain to stop producing the hormones that make you happy. Respect your drug and it will treat you right. Go all out but do it far apart (I recommend 4 to 6 months), dose up as high as is comfortable and save it for special occasions. MDMA can be a really special experience, don&#039;t waste it all on the dancefloor.

				Back in my senior year, I was taking 4+ pills every friday night for three months straight. The most I ever reached was 4 pressed pills and 4 molly caps throughout the night. After that night I noticed some mild visual distortions when I turned my head quick or in the corner of my eye. Anyways other than that I never suffered depression or any other symptoms really. Although, I wouldn&#039;t want to relive that experience no matter how much fun it was at the time. :)

				Well i can&#039;t comment on the multiple rolls thing as i have never taken MDMA more than once a month. <br />But for taking in one night, most MDMA i have ever done is 1.3g in a night. Not something i will ever do again, though i don&#039;t really do MDMA anymore anyway, much cheaper, better imo alternatives.<br />It was pretty good MDMA, best i have ever had and i only took so much because some how we had half a gram left over and no body seemed to think they had paid for it so as i organized it i had it. And a couple of people gave me a bomb because they didn&#039;t fancy any more (think that was partly due to the getting laid being on the table)<br />Any way it was massively intense, couldn&#039;t stop moving (dancing on the spot, little unfortunate as i had work) until about 18 hours after i first dropped. When it wore off it was pretty unpleasant, just felt really down, due to serotonin depletion i imagine. I still reckon .5g is probably the bang on amount for a night out, though i do normally feel it has worn off by the end of the night so sometimes it ends a tad early.

				Most I have taken is like 12 in a night. I used to boost ( half a pill every 30 mins ) But have taken 5 in an hour once. Not a nice experience. I&#039;ve taken 10 and passed out before. I used to crush them up and snort with coke, do wizz bombs and finish off with weed. washed down with booze. Surprised I didn&#039;t kill myself in them days. Not I have the odd blast on coke and the odd smoke, few benzos. I stay away from pills and haven&#039;t done acids for over 20 years. Pills are very morish. The only reason you usually stop taking them is because you run out. Seriously just stick to 1-2 pills max and just enjoy it. And as for taking 2 nights running, I used to do that and ended up with crazy mental zaps and just felt a inch short of losing it. Brain totally fried. Give yourself time to recover.

				You will be ok, but i agree wait a month, also if you are doing RC&#039;s like methylone and MDPV it will mess with your tolerance too. Skyys pink rockstars are pretty clean if thats what you took, but be very careful cause a lot of pills are not that clean and eating that many could be very dangerous.

				Me and my mates used to chain a couple of nights together.<br /><br />Second night was usually at home, so high on speed and/or stoned that we wouldn&#039;t have known if the pills were doing much or not.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also eaten a 10pack of pills to myself in 1 night which at the time, we thought were &quot;ok&quot;.<br /><br />But as others have alluded to, after the second or third one there was basically no improvement in the quality of the roll. I just got more retarded / awake and stayed that way for quite a few hours.<br /><br />Gnarly headache in the latter stages also (mild serotonin syndrome?).<br /><br />Thinking back on it now (was 5-6 years ago&nbsp; :o) almost makes my stomach turn.<br /><br />The thought of my poor little brain up there just crying...<br /><br />No need to rehash &quot;best practice&quot; as others have covered it well enough.<br /><br />Just wanted to discourage anyone from getting too eager and ruining this beautiful drug.
