				Hi, I&#039;d appreciate a bit of advice from someone who knows more that me please!<br /><br />I am going to an outdoor party this weekend and want to share my coke with someone who has bad hayfever. Would dissolving the coke in a small amount of water, then drinking it be a reasonable ROA if her nose is blocked? Any other ideas gratefully accepted!<br /><br />Cheers.

				They could freebase it or you might look to see if coke can be absorbed subligually.

				Don&#039;t drink it!! You can dissolve it into a nasal spray, but working the dosage would be tricky, I suggest an eye dropper and a tiny amount of water.. make sure you drop into the nose!<br /><br />Or you can plug in...

				Clear one of their nostrils temporarily with ZICAM nasal spray/gel solution. It&#039;s worked for me before. lol

				Would suggest plugging or freebasing like the others but probably not the easiest roa at an outdoor party! Don&#039;t drink it - it won&#039;t work.<br /><br />Gumming it could be an option if snorting impossible.

				Swallowing it would be a total waste of money. <br /><br />People have already recommended shooting or plugging. You said your friend is female, tho? In that case there&#039;s a 3rd option: <br /><br />(clearnet) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15236978<br /><br /><br />If she&#039;s totally new to the stuff just have her rub it on her gums or dissolve it under her tongue. It won&#039;t get her as high as snorting &amp; won&#039;t be quite as fun but she&#039;ll still get a decent buzz of it.&nbsp;

				Really I wouldn&#039;t freebase it.<br /><br />High lasts like 5-10 minutes tops.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just plug it or clear your nose with netipot and nasal decongestant.

				Thanks for all the advice. In the end she was fine snorting it, though it did take her ages to hoof up the lines through the blocked nose.<br /><br />Not sure if I offended someone, or if I have been reported to a moderator for making an &#039;Infowars post&#039;. I had no idea what that meant, though I will guess that it is a post designed to get people arguing. Which this wasn&#039;t, it was a genuine request for advice as we aren&#039;t very experienced with cocaine.<br /><br />Someone gave me my second -1, I assume for this post ...
