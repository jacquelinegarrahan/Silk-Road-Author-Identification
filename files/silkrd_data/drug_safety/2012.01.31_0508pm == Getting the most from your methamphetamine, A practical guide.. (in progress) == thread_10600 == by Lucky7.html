				Ok, there is a lot of misinformation circulating the drug culture, as well as misleading myths and rumors about methamphetamine and its use. So I am starting this as a guide and how-to, with helpful tips and troubleshooting, to get the absolute most from you high grade methamphetamine. I cannot possibly complete this in one sitting no matter how much I use to try an attempt it, so I will post what I can when I can, hopefully updating frequently. I am going to edit in the updates to this first post to keep everything neat and in one place, and will post something afterwards to bump the thread and inform the community of a new update.<br /><br />Anyone is welcome to post here whether it is a discussion, questions, constructive criticism, or your own knowledge/advice/info/tips that you have discovered along the way, which I may even add into the guide. However if anyone posts anything that is downright false, misleading, dangerous or would be a substantial or unreasonable waste of product, I will update the guide with a warning not to follow said info and my reasoning for doing so.<br /><br />*In my step by step guides I am not going to make additional steps for stupid stuff like &quot;buy meth&quot;, so this guide will assume you already have high grade meth, and maybe some common household items and most important, common sense.<br /><br />So lets begin.<br /><br />Someone was asking in another thread about how to properly do a hot rail, so I am going to start with that... Hot railing meth combines both smoking and snorting into one very enjoyable practice. *Note- you will need a small mirror{best} or metal surface)<br /><br />1- Go to your local gas station and buy a glass stem (used to make a crack pipe, will be sold wherever they have meth pipes, ask for a glass rose) the thicker the glass the better your experience will be.<br /><br />2- Take your meth and crush/chop as finely as possible, you want straight powder for this, no pieces left or your gonna be in pain. After you have your powder, place a normal size line on your mirror, or other heat resistant surface, you don&#039;t want it all bunched together but you don&#039;t want it exceptionally long either.<br /><br />3- Using a quality butane torch lighter or better, a propane torch, heat one end of your glass stem, the bottom 1/4th of it will do. You need to really heat it up good, at the least 45 seconds, but I always go for a minute. Now if your using a propane torch with a large flame then you will need to heat for less time. Make sure to get the entire end by moving the flame around evenly, you&#039;ll know its done when it starts to glow red.<br /><br />4- Immediately after removing the flame (if using a propane torch, take the extra second to turn off your torch before proceeding!) and quickly, bring your nose to the top of the stem, or as close as you can get ( a thin crappy one will transfer heat and may be too hot to put directly in your nose, but a thick glass one will be fine, and works the best). Using the stem as a straw, or &#039;tooter&#039; as some say, bring the super hot end to the beginning of the line, holding it at an angle,&nbsp; take a deep sniff, finishing your line in one motion.<br /><br />And that is a hot rail! Exhale, if that line comes out as a cloud of vapor then congrats, you did it properly and are now high as fuck! :-)<br /><br />If you sniff dry meth regularly, you will most likely like the feeling in your nose, I do, but if not it will burn. Hey, no pain no gain!<br /><br />That is why its important to make sure its hot enough, the meth will vaporize instantly when passing through the heated part of the stem, if its hot but just barely not enough, you could possibly end up sniffing up molten meth that hasn&#039;t completely turned to vapor yet, which will suck. Rule of thumb, its better to heat too long than not long enough.<br /><br />The best upgrade for this is a decent size (4in or so) pyrex tube, the pyrex will hold the heat MUCH better, ensuring that it is hot enough to vaporize lines on the sniff, plus it doesn&#039;t transfer heat up the tube so theres no worry about burning your nose or finger if your in a hurry or are real fucked up.<br /><br />The hot rail works the best for people with a tolerance that require larger amounts, amounts you couldn&#039;t smoke out of a ball pipe or off foil in a single hit.<br /><br />My next guide is coming very soon. It will be on how to properly vaporize meth off of aluminum foil, while not wasting anything! :)<br /><br />I&#039;m in a bit of a hurry now that I took forever with that last part, so I&#039;m not spell checking or proof reading until I get back from some errands.<br />

				^^bump<br /><br />although if you smoke it you know you are not getting the most of your gak, as, when you exhale, the smoke leaves you and you see it go......<br />so in addition, to get even more out of your twak, use the main-line method. it is much more than what you get from any other mean of ingesting. yes, it is not recommended if you want to keep the life you currently live, but, it will be the only acceptable way after the fist time you push that plunger.<br /><br />peace

				That&#039;s neat, I&#039;ve never heard of that method. It&#039;s pretty interesting, I might give it a try with one of these glass stem crack pipes that I haven&#039;t been able to sell. :P<br />And maybe I can actually sell some of them now.... lol!<br /><br />Very informative thread, looking forward to the next update. ;D

				Holy shit, I&#039;ve never thought about the hot rail before, I really want to try that, now... I presume that it&#039;s more effective than smoking by itself? That&#039;s how I usually do it...

				here is a video of some guy doing hot rails youtube.com/watch?v=NZrntoYdUyE<br /><br />my recovering meth addict friend told me that when he did hot rails, it felt like getting punched in the face. Then all of a sudden you exhale this huge plume of smoke. You get retarded high when you do it right. <br />I&#039;ve tried using a windproof BBQ lighter with mediocre success since I don&#039;t have a real blow torch lol..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Appreciate the comments, glad you guys like it. I really had planned on updating the guide some more by now but you know how time flies when your high on meth, lol. I should have an update soon, I just like to wait until I have the time to sit(get spun) and work on it for a while to get all the details in and everything &#039;in place&#039;. Planning for much more random helpful info in the near future.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: PriscillaMarie90 link=topic=10600. msg97388#msg97388 date=1328062279</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That&#039;s neat, I&#039;ve never heard of that method.

Did you get a chance to try it yet? Always looking to hear feedback from another seasoned user, especially with this method as its usually more appreciated by those that prefer larger doses as it all goes straight to the brain in seconds!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10600.msg99750#msg99750">Quote from: tordemon on February 03, 2012, 01:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You get retarded high when you do it right. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;Yep! First time I did it I was underestimating it, thinking like yea yea just another more complicated way of smoking for the people afraid of the ball pipe stigma, but then I did it, I swear it hit quick and hard I was literally sitting there with my mouth open, disoriented, but in a good way, once my brain could process what just happened it was like, oh yeah, damn I&#039;m high as fuck.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10600.msg100380#msg100380">Quote from: funway on February 03, 2012, 06:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To get the most from meth, do low doses (5-15mg) orally. It won&#039;t blow your mind, but it is more sustainable in the long run. A lot of positives, almost no negatives.<br /><br />People take adderall daily without problems. The same can be done with meth, but without adderall&#039;s shitty side effects.<br /><br />I&#039;m not against smoking it or doing hot rails. I&#039;m just sharing my opinion of how to get the most from it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thats pretty much how I take it for work&nbsp; except I prefer average doses doses, but oral ingestion and even sniffing is smoother and more clear headed than adderall. I just use meth instead of adderall. I mean it is an fda approved drug (desoxyn) in the same family of amphetamine stimulants after all.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I really should stop smoking the stuff though, It&#039;s pointlessly addictive cause you keep wanting to go back for another, when you can take the whole amount orally or insufflated and have better end results. What I find helpful is when you first get something, especially a few grams and don&#039;t want to smoke through it all, weigh out a couple 1/2g or 1/4g bagged separate, for smoking, and put away the rest. That way when you finish those and still want to smoke more at least you&#039;ll still have some left. It really helps you realize how much your actually using, cause if you just drop an 8ball in your pocket and grab your ball pipe your gonna be missing days.<br /><br />Also, when your on a run and your old bag is almost empty and you already have new product on hand, instead of finishing the bag just stash it somewhere out of the way and one day sooner or later you will be glad you did.<br />
