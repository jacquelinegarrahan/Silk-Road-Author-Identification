				HI there! As some of you may know, I&#039;m LOVE Opiates!!! Started off my adventure with pills, and other than occasional poppy tea, I&#039;ve pretty much stayed with Rx. I&#039;m thinking the next step should be to try some Heroin :-D<br />Well I&#039;m not into IV&#039;ing anything EVER (I hope), so I want to try some for snorting; now I see there are different types of Heroin available and I have no idea which one to pick. Can someone please recommend which brand and vendor I should go with first? I&#039;m in the USA btw. Again, I only want to snort it!<br /><br />Thanks Gang!

				I would recommend going with one of the vendors from our lovely neighbor to the north. In terms of quality, OPI&#039;s #4 pebbles are the best of the best, but also the most expensive. A cheaper, but still high quality option, is #4 from a vendor like No GenRx or Tomorrowman. If you&#039;re just looking to sample a little bit, then maybe try Deluxe Delivery&#039;s NYC stamp bags - they have great reviews and I&#039;ve actually just placed an order to try them myself.<br /><br />Some good vendors from the EU include Psilocin&#039;s or drNyx&#039;s #3, but I believe they&#039;re both out of stock at the moment unfortunately.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a snorter, stick with #3 or #4 to start, as black tar cannot be snorted unless it&#039;s dissolved in saline (or a similar liquid) and then dripped into the nostril. <br /><br />As a first time user, please be careful - snort a very small bump to start, you can always take more - but not less. Have fun and enjoy the awesomeness of H responsibly! :)

				I agree with everything said above^^^^ except for ordering euro #3....its not very good for snorting and usually weaker than the #4 on here.

				Any you can get lol. As a Brit I&#039;d go for some #3 if available, very versatile i.e. you can smoke it, snuff it or slam it.<br /><br />I will usually buy a bag, snort half and smoke half.<br /><br />Smoking gives you more of a rush whereas snorting gives you more long term effects.<br /><br />Needles are scary but shooting is a piece of piss, doesn&#039;t really hurt and lets you fuckin got that gear whereas smoking and snorting is wasteful!<br /><br />Happy journeys!

				Make sure you get #4, it&#039;s the best quality and also water soluble.<br /><br />Some of the best vendors have been mentioned above, you will not be disappointed by any of their product.<br /><br />I&#039;m a new vendor and have afghan #4, check the link below for some info on the gear.<br /><br />I will soon have Double UO Globe China white in stock...............<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/dc9d5fe9a5

				I&#039;m Awaiting Psilocin&#039;s return. his No 3. more than satisfied, seeking better stuff or service would be gross greed.<br />And the sneakiest packaging I&#039;ve come across.<br /><br />Give his stuff a try, I&#039;m sure you would not regret.

				I am the same as you, new to using H. I was taking oxys regularly to control pain and decided if im being prescribed opiates i may as well take the real deal :D So...... I started using H 10 days ago and have bought No4 and No3 from AfghanApothecary, Frank Mathews And am currently witing for some from Poppy Power.<br />I have allready realised i like to sniff rather than snort and i like you dont intent on IV. What i would advise is for you to buy a promo pack from AA, it consists of 0.1 of No3 &amp; 0.1 of No4 both of which worked well for me. I prefer No4 to No3 as im not really fussed on the taste of chasing and aslo i have to spend time in hospital, so i can just have a sniff when im in bed on the ward ;) ONLY ONE THING !!! i was advised by a wise vendor on here (poppy power) that if im going to sniff, i should buy some scales and weigh all my hits. Thus minimalising the chance of overdose and im really REALLY glad i listend. The stuff off frank arrived today, No4 that stank like vinigar, so i put out 30mg, sniffed it and by christ did it work lol, if i had just tipped it out and judged it i may have got into trouble. Now if it was OPI&#039;s or from what the photos look like Poppy Powers gear i would probably be dead lol ! <br /><br />From what i have learned in 10 days there are only a few things to remember -<br />No2 is tar and is for smoking <br />No3 is brown and is also for smoking (free base)<br />No4 is pale (white) and is for sniffing (HCL)<br />i think they can all be IV&#039;d<br />anything you sniff MUST be weighed<br />START OFF SMALL WITHOUTH THE INFLUENCE OF ANY OTHER DRUGS (including alcohol)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; !!! ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY !!! <br /><br />I hope this helps and i hope people will join in and correct me because i must be wrong lololo<br /><br />Stay safe,<br />Skunky.
