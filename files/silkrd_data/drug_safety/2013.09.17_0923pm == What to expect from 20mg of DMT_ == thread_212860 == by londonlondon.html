				If you smoke the whole 20 mg in one hit it will be pretty trippy but not out-of-this-world.&nbsp; everyone&#039;s experience of this drug is different, but in my experience:&nbsp; you&#039;ll feel a very warm body buzz and possibly sexual arousal.&nbsp; you might feel a bit disoriented or confused, but just focus on the enjoying the warm body buzz and you&#039;ll get over the disorientation.&nbsp; with eyes open you&#039;ll probably see some flashy visuals or morphing fluid 3D shapes.&nbsp; with eyes closed your mind will wander into strange territory that you can&#039;t exactly explain.&nbsp; it&#039;ll start to fade after about 5 minutes and be totally over in 30.&nbsp; there&#039;s no hangover, and if anything, you&#039;ll feel refreshed and invigorated.&nbsp; you&#039;ll be totally fine to go to work the next day.<br /><br />i wouldn&#039;t eyeball the dose if you want to keep it low.&nbsp; i have a cheap milligram scale that i got for 20 bucks on amazon...its no good for dosing under 10mg, but anything above that it works fine.<br /><br />enjoy!

				Hi londonlondon and welcome to the DMT world!<br /><br />Well if it is your first time you are about to use it, you are doing a right thing to use 20mg just because it is easy to burn it until you learn the technique. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">as title reads, im going to start experimenting with DMT and was wondering what 20mg would be like?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t know which method you are going to use, but some experienced users can break through even with 20mg. All that matters is vaporizing it perfectly and holding your toke long enough. So the answer in what to expect depends really on how successfully you will vaporize it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> thinking of doing it tomorrow or thursday afternoon/evening. wanted to know if it would be a dumb idea to do it even though i have work the next day? what after effects can i expect?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />It wouldn&#039;t be a dumb idea even if you had to work 1 hour after you take it :) <br />Really, mean it. The after effects are really simple and they will be gone after 1 hour. Lets, say you don&#039;t vaporize it perfectly. In this case you may feel a bit tired and not wanting to move a lot for 10-15 minutes.<br />Let&#039;s say now that you do vaporize it correctly and you break through. The time pattern will go like this:<br />First 10-15 you are tripping, then you &quot;wake up&quot; but you will still be on your bed/sofa amazed, thinking of what just happened. In maximum one 40-60 minutes you will be as energized as before (if not more). <br />They only after effect I can think of that will last longer is euphoria and calmness. But that&#039;s a mental state. Your body will be as before taking it after 30 minutes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and last question, is there any object i can use for reference or any way to eyeball 20mg? besides the &#039;dividing-it-in-piles method&#039;?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Eyeballing such small amounts are really difficult. The only thing I can think of is to divide your total amount in equal pieces. That&#039;s will kind of work only if you know the exact amount of it and if it is a small amount like 50-100mg. If you don&#039;t know the total amount, then I would suggest to wait and find a scale. But if you have a lot, well... Just put some dmt there! There is no overdose or anything to be scared of :) It is not LSD.<br /><br /><br />Good luck with your attempt, and please let us know how it went.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz<br />

				I like to use a meth pipe to smoke my DMT. First time I tried loading it with just 30 mg. I got really close to breaking through, because it was pretty clean DMT, but it stopped short just of going all the way. After feeling like falling through a tunnel for what seemed like 2-3 seconds, I just felt like I&#039;d had too much acid.<br /><br /><br />Second attempt at breaking through, 30 minutes later, loaded the pipe with 100 mg and was careful not to burn any. I broke through and once I was ready to take more hits, the pipe was already loaded and ready for me to blast off several more times.

				http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/The_Machine<br /><br />Hm, it looks like I can just use an older smaller bong of mine and modify it just a little bit. Just put a cylinder made out of foil into the head. Is that really the amazing DMT machine? :P<br />A standard bong with foil and holes puls the DMT inside is exactly the same, or not?<br /><br />Even if I&#039;m missing something here it should work like this, only problem is maybe that you suck the DMT out of the foil cylinder while trying to vaporize it.<br /><br />Fun side-fact: In Gaspar Noé&#039;s Enter The Void just in the initial scene the main protagonist smokes DMT out of a &quot;crack pipe&quot; by just burning it. ;)

In your first try you maybe was a bit successful with vaporizing it. As for your second try that you got heavy headed I would say that the problem is the weed. Many talk about the sandwich method, but then again many say the DMT shouldn&#039;t be mixed with weed. I makes the trip blur, plus you will get this feeling of tiredness. Try and use only ash next time. But again I would suggest building The Machine. It is quick and easy to built. Plus you will use only DMT with it and it is a very successful method to vaporize your DMT. As for the wait, no don&#039;t worry. The quicker you will learn to do it right and breakthrough the better.&nbsp; If you believe that you are not &quot;ready&quot; to breakthrough I would say stop trying. Trust in the substance.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=212860.msg1548339#msg1548339">Quote from: londonlondon on September 19, 2013, 07:13 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">my key question is the following, how is the dmt supposed to vaporized? i have been using the sandwich method, which i know is highly regarded by many. i am using a regular, weed, glass pipe. made a bottom layer which is now and ash/weed bed. sprinkled the dmt over that. then some weed over the dmt (ive read that i should add a further layer of ash above the dmt, does this make a difference?).

				todays update: <br />not satisfactory :(<br />must&#039;ve gone through a further 150mg and had pretty much the same results as yesterday..slight morphing, patterns with eyes open...no CEVs<br /><br />you recommend i build the machine, but from what i&#039;ve read it&#039;s almost as confusing to start operating it, as it is by &#039;sandwich&#039; method :/<br />will maybe try making the machine tomorrow now that it&#039;s the weekend, but still want to know how to do the sandwich method! it&#039;s more practical...<br /><br />today i just laid the DMT above a bed of ash, with nothing on top the dmt. i inhaled veryyy slowly until the dmt melted, and i just kept inhaling just as slowly. not sure if after the DMT is melted i should pull harder? lower the flame so that it burns the ash? continue pulling very slowly? <br /><br />also, just as a side-note, i purchased from Vatican, don&#039;t know if anyone&#039;s familiar with his/her product, but the taste i am getting is not as harsh or as &#039;hard&#039; as people claim DMT is, is this normal? i have no doubts that Vatican&#039;s product is top notch and im not questioning the quality, but maybe this lack of smell is indicative that i am not burning it properly? <br /><br />:( i really want to get this right!<br />thanks for the thorough tips guys, you are the best :)<br />LL

				I will say it one more time, and then I will sit in silence. Maybe the mix of dmt and weed makes all of this.<br />Second of all, you use way to much. Don&#039;t do it. And finally what is confusing about the machine?<br /><br />Look how simple it is.<br />1. You take a 50-100 ml glass bottle.<br />2.Drill a hole at the bottom<br />3. Place some brillo in the neck. (after you have burn it a bit so you take away any chemical colors)<br />4. Place your 20, 40 100, 200mg dmt (doesn&#039;t really matter in the machine) up there<br />5. Heat the neck so the DMT melts in the brillo<br />6. Light up your lighter, put it close to the brillo and inhale.<br /><br />I mean this is the most simple thing to do. It takes 10 minutes to drill the hole, and 2 minutes to prepare before inhalation.<br /><br />

I tell you mate, you will not succeed soon the way you use it. Hopefully I am wrong, but I don&#039;t see it happen. You have already wasted a lot of DMT. You said also that you are going to love dmt, so maybe a good option if you plan to use it in the future is to invest on a GVG pipe. You will never go wrong with it and everytime you will have success.<br /><br />So if you you go away from your country and still plan to use dmt, how will you do it? Is it better to have a pipe or a bong and weed instead of a glass bottle with a hole in the bottom?&nbsp; :P :P <br /><br />I give up trying to convince you about the machine. It is the best way. If you love the idea of the mix weed/dmt, then I can only wish you good luck...<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m thinking about getting some DMT and vaporizing it, I have a friend who had some, smoked it off a paper in a glass pipe, didn&#039;t get beyond a 7(8-9 is breaking through.)&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that I can do it either 1 of 2 ways that I&#039;m going to try.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; First, I&#039;m gonna take a glass chillum and put steel wool or 5-8x fine metal screens in it, and heat with a waxed cord(this is how I smoke weed, minus the screens) with 5x screens below, and 2-3x screens above, and maybe some ashes or bits of weed below the first screen below the DMT.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, I&#039;m going to take this heating element P shaped thingy I got at a garage sale and put it inside a large(plastic) bottle with a hole in it, and put the DMT on a piece of foil inside the o part of the P.(I think its for making tea, so it gets up to 120C or so)&nbsp; Will 120C be hot enough to vape, or should I use my chillum(w/steel wool or screens)?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve also started filing down the bottom of a broken test tube, to make a crack-type pipe, only bigger than most, about 1.5cm across.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll heat it with a small candle or waxed string.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll update when I actually do it, because I think my friend is fucking insane for torching it with a lighter, I told him to put steel wool in the stem of his glass, and hit it through the carb!<br />

				Hm.. Interesting methods to try my friend GGGreenbud. Never heard anything about similar attempts.<br />I would suggest method one with the glass chillum. I would also say that maybe the ashes and the weed is not necessary. People use ash or herbs just because liquid DMT tends to &quot;run&quot; away from the heat and that&#039;s why they use steel wool or fine metal screens so the liquid DMT gets &quot;trapped&quot; and not run away. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t quite understand your second method to be honest, so I can&#039;t really judge it.<br />As for the temperatures, 120 Celsius with definitely burn it. The temperature of vaporization if between 60-80 C, (140 – 176 F) where 80 C (180 F) is the burning point.<br /><br />One more thing I would really like to know more about is how do you heat your spices with the waxed cord. <br />Can you share same more information about this process? Sound interesting.<br /><br />Good luck with your attempts and please keep us posted on how it went.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz

				Heyo londonlondon,<br /><br />[DAMN THIS WAS LONG: RECAP AT BOTTOM]<br /><br />DMT is one of my favorite substances and you&#039;ve gotten a lot of good tips and, while I wouldn&#039;t claim to be an expert by any means, I&#039;ve got a few success stories I can add. <br /><br />First, the quality of the product is a big thing. I&#039;ve never gotten any off of SR (always been able to access some homemade goods) so I can&#039;t comment on vendors so it can always be an issue there. <br /><br />Second, I&#039;m going to describe a technique that is easier to do (hard to master) and doesn&#039;t involve any extra equipment or work. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got a VaporGenie but a regular weed pipe would probably work too (meth pipe is something else I think would work really well but have never tried it. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t know what a VG is you can look it up but basically it&#039;s a pipe with metal on the inside with a proper narrow bowl for applying screens (I like to stack three screens in my pipe). <br /><br />I&#039;ll assume you&#039;ll be using some sort of regular glass weed pipe so you&#039;ll need that, preferably three screens (I&#039;ve used steel and copper[brass? I can&#039;t remember atm] so use whatever you like/got]) and a regular &#039;ol bic lighter (although I like to have 3 or 4 on hand just in case one gets too hot or something [not too likely but it can happen depending on your strategy]). <br /><br />So what to do is clean out the pipe if it isn&#039;t already -- you can have a thin layer of ash but I never bother with it: weed ruins the experience and I&#039;m too lazy to find the perfect ash or what have you. <br /><br />Place the three screens in the bowl -- depending on screen/bowl size this could be a frustrating chore so hopefully you have a bowl/screen combo that you know works. I hate trying to cut down screens. <br /><br />Measure out your DMT (please invest in a scale -- go to amazon or what have you and get a cheap .001 scale: it&#039;ll work wonders forever if you take care of it and even a cheap one can get you to +-5mg). I would suggest a pile of anywhere between 15-25mg (until&nbsp; you have a good technique, more, for me, seemed to result in more chance of wasted product). <br /><br />Take your DMT pile and scrape/sprinkle it onto the screens. The overlapping screens should keep it there pretty well (if you are going the ash route, I&#039;d suggest putting the ash on the bottom screen and piling the other screens on top with the DMT at the very top). <br /><br />Now, when you flick the lighter the flame should be above the bowl (not touching it or going inside it!)<br /><br />Below is some butchered ascii art showing the flame and the pipe (the first being closer to the pipe I imagine you might use and the second being closer to a metal pipe/is set up similar to a VG)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/ ) (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(_)/&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; __.....--....____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (_[...._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`--.._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ,----------.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `-._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&quot;`--.._/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `-._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;J<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`-.._/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`-.._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ,&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`--..______.-&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/ ) (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(_)/&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;_______<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;___)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (__<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ,-.-&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;|----------------|&nbsp; `-----&#039; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|_._&nbsp; &nbsp;|________________|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`--&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `----------&#039;<br /><br /><br />The important part is that the flame be an inch or so above the bowl when you are pulling. Pull gently so you don&#039;t run out of breath and adjust the flame height until you can see/feel the flame/heat being pulled towards the bowl (try not to actually suck the flame inside unless the DMT is really deep in the bowl -- if the flame gets to close the DMT will just burn up and that&#039;s no good). If you get an idea amount of flame-heated air pulling through the DMT should start hitting you rather harshly -- encouraging a cough. Try to suck in as much as you can and hold it in for several seconds. Breathe out. Do it again. Try for three pulls in quick succession for an intense experience (it&#039;s hard. Usually I settle for some shallow hits held for a couple seconds and do two pulls unless I&#039;m really wanting to push myself). <br /><br />The DMT melts really easily and so the screens/ash should catch it and keep it close and then it&#039;ll vaporize quickly after that. It&#039;s a technique that I use often and works well for me. Maybe it&#039;s one you&#039;d prefer as I feel it gives me more control over the conditions of melting and vaping the DMT (when I&#039;ve tried with weed and ash and stuff I feel like I have no idea what&#039;s going on with the product and that I&quot;m just hoping for the best. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That was really long so here&#039;s the recap:<br /><br />1) Any glass bowl<br />2) Some metal screens (3)<br />3) 15-25mg DMT sprinkled either on top or on the bottom screen<br />4) Distant flame while pulling gently so the flame doesn&#039;t touch or go in the bowl<br />5) Pull lungful, hold for several seconds (some friends have encouraged a 10 count), breathe out<br />6) Repeat step 5 2-3 times<br />7) Be someplace comfortable, dimly lit or dark (my preference), and close or nearly close your eyes and let your mind drift/paint the world that opens up.<br /><br /><br />Cheers and I hope that helps. I look forward to a successful trip report sometime!<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

And unforunately the ascii art isn&#039;t mine: I did have to do some modifications and changes because the art didn&#039;t come over well but the majority of the work goes to someone else. I completely agree with you about the weed/DMT -- just tried it again with a buddy the other week because he recommended it so highly and...nope. I really did see it as a waste: holding in weed smoke for a long period of time isn&#039;t my thing and it just overall fucked the experience up.<br /><br />You summed it up great though: flame and breathing. DMT is probably the drug that I feel takes the most finesse and practice to get the most out of it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

The overlapping screens should keep it there pretty well (if you are going the ash route, I&#039;d suggest putting the ash on the bottom screen and piling the other screens on top with the DMT at the very top). <br /><br />Now, when you flick the lighter the flame should be above the bowl (not touching it or going inside it!)<br /><br />Below is some butchered ascii art showing the flame and the pipe (the first being closer to the pipe I imagine you might use and the second being closer to a metal pipe/is set up similar to a VG)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/ ) (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(_)/&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; __.....--....____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (_[...._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`--.._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ,----------.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `-._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&quot;`--.._/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `-._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;J<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`-.._/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`-.._&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ,&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;`--..______.-&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) \<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/ ) (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(_)/&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;_______<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;___)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (__<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ,-.-&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;|----------------|&nbsp; `-----&#039; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|_._&nbsp; &nbsp;|________________|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`--&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `----------&#039;<br /><br /><br />The important part is that the flame be an inch or so above the bowl when you are pulling. Pull gently so you don&#039;t run out of breath and adjust the flame height until you can see/feel the flame/heat being pulled towards the bowl (try not to actually suck the flame inside unless the DMT is really deep in the bowl -- if the flame gets to close the DMT will just burn up and that&#039;s no good). If you get an idea amount of flame-heated air pulling through the DMT should start hitting you rather harshly -- encouraging a cough. Try to suck in as much as you can and hold it in for several seconds. Breathe out. Do it again. Try for three pulls in quick succession for an intense experience (it&#039;s hard. Usually I settle for some shallow hits held for a couple seconds and do two pulls unless I&#039;m really wanting to push myself). <br /><br />The DMT melts really easily and so the screens/ash should catch it and keep it close and then it&#039;ll vaporize quickly after that. It&#039;s a technique that I use often and works well for me. Maybe it&#039;s one you&#039;d prefer as I feel it gives me more control over the conditions of melting and vaping the DMT (when I&#039;ve tried with weed and ash and stuff I feel like I have no idea what&#039;s going on with the product and that I&quot;m just hoping for the best. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That was really long so here&#039;s the recap:<br /><br />1) Any glass bowl<br />2) Some metal screens (3)<br />3) 15-25mg DMT sprinkled either on top or on the bottom screen<br />4) Distant flame while pulling gently so the flame doesn&#039;t touch or go in the bowl<br />5) Pull lungful, hold for several seconds (some friends have encouraged a 10 count), breathe out<br />6) Repeat step 5 2-3 times<br />7) Be someplace comfortable, dimly lit or dark (my preference), and close or nearly close your eyes and let your mind drift/paint the world that opens up.<br /><br /><br />Cheers and I hope that helps. I look forward to a successful trip report sometime!<br /><br /><br />Snoopish<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+++++1!!<br />you sir, and everyone posting in this thread, are gold mines :)<br />thanks a million for taking your time to carefully write this out in such a detailed and clear manner :D<br />will be ordering a scale right away, and im seriously considering the VG, it&#039;s not too expensive but definitely going through a saving-money phase <br />hope to have a trip report for next week, when scale arrives<br />LL<br />

				20mg will have a significant effect only if you smoke it very efficiently. In reality some will likely be burned and do nothing.<br /><br />35-45mg if smoked correctly will certainly create a major event.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about going to work later, no matter how big the trip you will be back in 10 minutes and fully sober in 1 hour(there is a euphoria afterwards that lasts longer than the trip).<br /><br />If you have the means I recommend a &quot;Vapor Geni&quot; as your smoking device. It lets you get all of it every time.

				big ups for all the continued, solid advice from such knowledgeable, experienced, selfless individuals :)<br /><br />the reason why im aiming for a sub-threshold dose is because i will be trying it alone. i don&#039;t have any friends were im atm who can tripsit :(.<br />want to at least get my feet wet with a lower dose.<br />i guess i will end up buying the Vapor Genie.<br /><br />sending the bestest most amazingest vibes to all of you!!! :P<br />LL<br /><br />ps: how good is the VG for vaping weed? can it be turned into a normal bowl too? <br />i ask this question below here cause i dont want to deviate the main point of my post, or the thread in general, just a side note :)<br />

				I don&#039;t know if this is the best advice but here is a trick I have done to smoke DMT alone.<br /><br />I take a length of string and I tie it to a hook on the ceiling and the other end to my pipe such that there is enough slack for me to sit back and smoke it. Then I can just drop the pipe and it will swing away from you harmlessly.<br /><br />You will want to test the the length is right and they it will not swing into any objects.<br /><br />I do this with a vapor geni which never produces a cherry, doing this with a pipe that has embers is not a good idea.

The first phase is the rotating rooms. Here you have complete mental rationality and functioning. You may panic due to the intensity. But you will be aware and have enough control for long enough to put down any pipe or bong onto a surface close by.<br /><br />Try closing your eyes after taking a hit of weed laying back and then placing the bong or pipe on a table next to you. You have to be aware of hot pipes and putting them down, but it isn&#039;t the problem most people make it out to be.<br /><br />When you are in the rotating rooms moving through the experience, you may feel some panic, this is because the speed of the from body to out of body is quick. Too quick for you to work out what is going on, try to focus on your breathing. And if you get feeling that you are dying just go with it. Knowing that you have taken DMT.<br /><br />If sacred about it, start slow and work your way up, 5mg, 10mg, 15 mg, 20mg etc Practice meditation for 30 mins before the hit, get your mind and intentions calm.<br /><br />A trip sitter is good. But if they are in the same room very very distracting. You audio process are sensitive and any outside world distractions will bring you back. Even hearing them breathing can be annoying.<br /><br />Get them to wait outside the room, once you have taken the hit.<br /><br />The second state is the breakthrough and if you make it here you won&#039;t even care any more about letting go.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I only take DMT with acid after a good meditation and being in the right mental state, or with MDMA (only before the MDMA peak) afterwards it is just a waste of product.<br /><br />The first time you take DMT you&#039;ll have no idea of what to expect. So you actually won&#039;t be that nervous more excited. So try to go for a big hit, after reading loads on smoking techniques. I find a small bong, with a little water and ash or several metal screens in the bowl. Is the easiest method apart from buying a GVG.<br /><br />The second time you take DMT well, then , then you&#039;ll be shitting your pants...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />FH <br /><br />
