				Has anyone ever done LSD around 1200 micrograms? How was it? How did you integrate those experiences?<br /><br />I did 1200ug once, and it was mindblasting! The onset was a bit scary because it was so intensive, but at the peak I somehow elevated to another level of reality. What I experienced there can&#039;t be put in words! :)<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend such high doses to anyone, because it can seriously screw your mind. Those who are chosen to go 1200ug and beyond will do it anyway...<br /><br />Share your experiences

				I have once done a dose of around 1000 mics which was really insane, even more so because it was accidental (when making vials, remember to wash the cup before you take a glas of water). I havent gotten the feeling that I was different after that but I do remember that it was a frightening experience. Remember how you feel when you are alone in the forest and the wind blows for a bit and makes that &quot;swishing sound&quot; and then stops again. Thats how I felt. Almost like I was dissociated and just staring at all the strange lines appearing everywhere I looked. It was really insane :P<br /><br />I cant even begin to write how that trip went but it also had a difficult feeling, everything was easy yet I kept on saying how difficult thing were, not because of what they were but how they were made. When I have time I might make a cool trip report out of it!

				@robotzombie @Holly<br /><br />I could quote every sentence you posted in this thread and add &quot;I agree&quot;. Thank you for contributing, in this thread and in the world.<br /><br />I feel exactly the same about the solo aspect and the lucidity that Holly has described. And I made a similar experience like robotzombie when I did 1200ug almost 5 years ago. It was the complete dissolution of the self with the universe in its full entity. The things I experienced were very abstract. There was no such thing as linear time or 3 dimensional space anymore. Instead I perceived the direct implementation of reality. The best expression I can think of to describe this state is &quot;ultra-plural existence&quot;. It&#039;s the most sublime experience one can have.<br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t sound too weird...

One of the best parts of acid IMO.<br /><br />That&#039;s awesome that your parents were cool with you tripping man. That&#039;s actually huge. When I lived at home and I would trip, (alone in my room), I had to make sure not to laugh too loud or anything, because my parents are both right-wing, almost-fundamentalist christian, EXTREMELY anti-drugs. They literally think cannabis and LSD are from the devil...and I&#039;m up in my room tripping really hard, trying to smoke weed and mask the smell...rofl.

I&#039;ve only tripped with someone else once, and he wasn&#039;t into acid for spiritual reasons, he was more of a &#039;IM TRIPPING BALLS LOL IM HALLUCINATING ALL OVER THE PLACE&#039; kind of person, so that was the last time I took acid with someone else.

				I&#039;ve eaten some pretty large doses. Please don&#039;t take this as dick-sizing. It&#039;s definitely not, I just want to explain how things work at megadoses. I&#039;ve eaten unmeasured crystal a few times, not like 10/th of a gram size, but a good bit. The largest measurable dose I took was a sheet of needlepoint back in &#039;97...back when there was real american needlepoint (there isn&#039;t any &#039;real needlepoint&#039; available sorry to say, the chemist responsible doesn&#039;t work anymore, just fluff). My friends had a jar of juice with .05g of needlepoint in it at a festival I think it was the great went or lemonwheel, don&#039;t remember which. It was a present from the man... the day before they asked me if I was ready, and they were kinda joking, so I thought...welp, the next night came around, they grabbed me and asked me one more time, I said yeah because I knew this was something I may not see again for a while, and 5 of us split that juice.<br /><br />As soon as it hit my tongue I was LIT. The crazy and great thing about doses that high is you are too high to worry...you don&#039;t get any of those jitters and you don&#039;t get paranoid, you are just THERE. Total ego loss. I was walking with my friends, holding a girl Amanda&#039;s dreads, when I lost them...oh well...:) Everything in the world was in these crazy neon bars of light, twirling in all colors of the rainbow. I didn&#039;t know where I was, just lost in this place, but I knew I was safe and it would all be ok. At one point I&#039;m just wandering around and some very good friends of mine grabbed me and sat me down...:) I was sorta beyond talking...This girl I had been hanging out with for the tour tried to get me to come hang out with her and get dirty, but I was WAAAAY too fucked up to be doing that, I wanted to wander...I saw some of the late night show I think, blacked out for a bit of it, then miraculously found my car...:) I laid down in the car for a little while, regained a little bit of my senses, and chilled. I started coming down around 8-10 hours...if you&#039;ve been on a big trip you&#039;ll know what I mean. you go from super spun to just pretty high but coherent rather quickly. <br /><br />Anyway, thats one of my stories...I got some more, but my fingers are tired...;) <br /><br />Take care guys. Remember, it&#039;s always gonna stop, and if you take enough all your worries melt away. You&#039;re just too fucked up to worry.

				I took the offcuts from my WoW sheets (the spare corners and slivers that are left over when I&#039;ve drawn the squares on) the other weekend, probably around 750ug, 5 altogether guessing by the ball of paper i was chewing on but not 100% sure. The put it mildly,: Total madness<br /><br />I was in a burble where i could see the real world, my computer, house, dogs etc, but moving focus inside the bubble was like i was just pure energy.&nbsp; Felt i could see the whole world, past/, present and future, all intertwined in a a timeless realisation, all interacting with each other.&nbsp; If listened, the emotion of all those entities was flowing through me like a torrent of happiness sadness, Pain, suffering, joy and elation, i wept tears of joy hours for hours. It was just beautiful<br /><br />Why this FUCK this stuff is illegal is beyond me

I always prefer solo tripping. I&#039;ve only tripped with someone else once, and he wasn&#039;t into acid for spiritual reasons, he was more of a &#039;IM TRIPPING BALLS LOL IM HALLUCINATING ALL OVER THE PLACE&#039; kind of person, so that was the last time I took acid with someone else.

And I made a similar experience like robotzombie when I did 1200ug almost 5 years ago. It was the complete dissolution of the self with the universe in its full entity. The things I experienced were very abstract. There was no such thing as linear time or 3 dimensional space anymore. Instead I perceived the direct implementation of reality. The best expression I can think of to describe this state is &quot;ultra-plural existence&quot;. It&#039;s the most sublime experience one can have.<br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t sound too weird...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not weird at all.&nbsp; ;D perfecto.
