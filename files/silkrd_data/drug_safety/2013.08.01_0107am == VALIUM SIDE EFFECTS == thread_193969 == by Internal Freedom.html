				Hey guys, I have a question about the Benzo valium if we have any experts here that may be able to provide me with an answer.<br /><br />On monday, for the first time ever, I tried a 10mg valium. It was nice, but the next day I woke up feeling severely nauseated, dizzy and quite weak. I thought I might be getting sick but I looked it up online and it seems that these are side effects that people get the days after valium. I woke up again today (Wednesday) and also had the same nausea and weakness that I had the day before. I also attended a music festival and unfortunately had a shitty time because I was so dizzy and weak the whole time.<br /><br />Does anyone know how long these side effects will last? This is completely fucked. I&#039;m never doing Valium again, hands down the worst experience Ive had with any drug. The fucking dizziness wont go away!

				I do not experience many side effects other than feeling a bit zonked for a few days, although I took 10mg yesterday and have felt kind of queasy since last night but only very slightly. You may be just more sensitive to the side effects. <br /><br />Keep in mind that valium has a very long half life. I&#039;ve read that overall it&#039;s 36 hours and that one particular metabolite of valium has a 100 hour half life! So, it stays in your system for a very long time. Give it about a week from when you took it and the side effects should be gone.

				That&#039;s pretty sensitive! RU sure it was pharmaceutical Valium/Diazepam? Some of the Diazepam sold on here is shitty Pakistani garbage. <br /><br />It&#039;s ideal to find Roche brand, what&#039;s left out there, as Roche just discontinued Valium name brand. <br /><br />Though any American or UK brand generic Diazepam is good.
