				The first time I rolled, like 15 years ago, it was an amazing experience.&nbsp; Of course I have never replicated it fully, but I have had some good times on pressed pills I bought at concerts in the 2000&#039;s.<br /><br />Recently I got some MDMA, as well as methylone, from several dealers on SR.&nbsp; I got a little buzzed, but nothing like those times last decade.&nbsp; My friends, who took the same stuff, said that they were satisfied, so I don&#039;t think I got bunk. <br /><br />All I can think of is that now I am now on a light anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication called Celexa.&nbsp; Its my only prescription.&nbsp; I know it is a brain-chemistry modifier, and someone suggested that it is maybe preventing the molly from releasing the serotonin as it should.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone else made this connection, or know anything about it?&nbsp; <br /><br />-B45<br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;It could be that elevated levels of serotonin on a permanent basis are keeping you from feeling the flood from taking MDMA.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a friend who takes celexa, and I don&#039;t bother with doing psychs or MDMA with him because I know it is almost impossible, and even if you can get past the blockade, the high isn&#039;t as good.&nbsp; You gotta cut down over a cycle and get to a lower dose so that the difference between your max levels and constantly elevated levels from the Celexa is there, because you need space between those two levels to have an experience.&nbsp; I could go into it more, look into 5-HT-1 receptor desensitization(important.)&nbsp; Celexa is pretty much the hardest psych med to trip/roll on, as far as SSRIs go.&nbsp; &nbsp;Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers aren&#039;t even as strong, at least the atypical ones.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people have suggested that people on SSRIs might roll better off of Methylone.&nbsp; Hope that helps!

				SSRI&#039;s bascially ruin your mdma experience by definition. It is their very mechanism of action that prevents you to roll on mdma, and it does not matter that much which exact ssri you are on. These effects are widely known for medications like fluoxetine (prozac) and citalopram. <br /><br />If you are interested in the biochemistry behind you can probably find a bit about that on this forum, wikipedia and other sources, or i can explain it a bit further if you want to know. <br /><br />An important notice is that this is valid for all ssri&#039;s, regardless if prescribed for depression, anxiety or otherwise. Other anxiolytics like benzodiazepines do not have this effect and allow mdma to be effective, although they may reduce the intensity of the trip and in high dosages prevent/cancel it mostly.

				Yup any SSRI will ruin a roll or in better words pretty much not allow you to roll.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried it both on Celexa and Lexapro.&nbsp; Both a big fail.&nbsp; Both times popped a fairly good roll and with in 20-40 minutes I started feeling that glow and the slightest rise in peak of euphoria but than it just doesn&#039;t go anywhere at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;
