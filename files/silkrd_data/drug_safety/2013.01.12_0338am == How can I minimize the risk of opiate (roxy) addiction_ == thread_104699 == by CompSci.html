				On average, how often must one take roxies before one develops a physical dependence to the drug? For example, could someone get away with doing a 30MG roxy everyday for a week and then immediately stop without getting &quot;sick?&quot;<br /><br />I ask because I love opiates but I also value my safety. Unfortunately, as an opiate lover who values their safety, I find it really hard to gauge safe use etiquette of the drug. In fact, there seems to be so much disinformation out there regarding the recreational use of opiates. For example, a lot of anti-drug types will tell you that doing heroin once will get you addicted for life yet we all know that&#039;s complete and utter bullshit. (Any addict who claims otherwise is just making an excuse for their complete lack of self-control)<br /><br />So, to the responsible opiate lovers out there: How do you minimize the risk of becoming physically dependent on the drug?

				tl;dr: A week binge of 30mg of Roxy a day appears to be my absolute limits in order to avoid physical dependence but tolerance becomes an issue after four days. Meanwhile, 3-4 day binges of 30mg of Roxy each month appears to be an ideal sweet spot.<br /><br />Long version:<br /><br />I appreciate the responses. There seems to be a lot of people who say &quot;never do it&quot; and; &quot;There is no way to do it safely!&quot; Sadly, this is all misinformation and is exactly what I was trying to avoid. I&#039;m not trying to be a dick but those answers are grossly inaccurate and perhaps even dangerous because it enables addictive behavior. Anyhow, despite popular opinion, opiates don&#039;t have some sort of supernatural addiction properties hidden within them. In reality, it is just that addicts of opiates are the most vocal users. Addicts also tend to justify their stupid actions by claiming they are &quot;powerless&quot; against the drug. Meanwhile, those who use opiates responsibly for recreational purposes are rarely ever heard from for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Anyhow, despite some of the inaccurate answers I appreciate those who tried to give helpful advice. (e.g. taking it once a month or a couple times a month) However, I still feel that the figures mentioned above are far too conservative. I also feel that saying the cliche phrase &quot;use in moderation and have self-control&quot; is a vast oversimplification of the issue, too. The real purpose of my post was to come to some sort of agreement on what the definition of &quot;moderation&quot; and &quot;self-control&quot; is.<br /><br />Personally, I just did 30MG of Roxy everyday for a week and today is my first sober day. I&#039;m not feeling any physical withdraw symptoms and while I&#039;m most certainly wishing I could do another 30MG tonight I won&#039;t -- I don&#039;t even have any available even if I wanted to. However, I have the necessary funds to buy more and yet I&#039;m not going to do it because I know that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do. In fact, I recently came into an extra couple thousand dollars this month of disposable income and most of it is going towards long-term investments. (e.g. stocks and bonds) Sadly, I will have to say goodnight to my &quot;sweet prince&quot; until next month. (Anyone get the reference?&nbsp; :P)<br /><br />So to sum things up: if you&#039;re a responsible opiate user who enjoys the occasional opiate binge I&#039;ve successfully found that a week of 30MG Roxy&#039;s a day has given me no ill effects so this might be a good limit for monthly usage. (Obviously, results may vary though) The only negative I found was that towards the end of the week 30MG felt a bit weak -- I was clearly building up a tolerance to it. Fortunately, I discovered that I was able to counter this by taking 50-100MG of Diphenhydramine (OTC sleeping pill). I also found that It also helped to take 15MG orally with the sleeping pill and then, once the pills took effect, to insufflate the remaining 15MG.<br /><br />For over a decade I&#039;ve actually stuck to 3-4 day binges a month which I&#039;ve found works extremely well. The great thing about 3-4 day binges is that my tolerance to 30MG of Roxy never really became an issue. This is the biggest positive I can think of to sticking to a 3-4 day binge rather than a week binge each month.<br /><br />In conclusion I suspect a week binge of 30MG a day is the absolute limits for me. If I were to go longer it became clear that my tolerance was going to require significantly higher doses which I took as a sign a physical dependence to the drug was imminent. As a result I&#039;m now thinking that I should usually stick to 3-4 day binges a month for most of the year and occasionally treat myself to a week binge once to twice a year.<br /><br />Anyhow, good luck to the fellow responsible opiate users out there.

				Compsci you are the one spreading misinformation. How long have you been using? Not long I betl<br /><br />Of course you feel no withdrawal from a 30mg &quot;binge&quot; because that is a tiny dose. The point is people keep chipping away and up the dose over months/years. It is inevitable if you want to keep getting as high as you used to.<br /><br />Don&#039;t call me a junkie you know nothing about me.

				its not so much about self control, as it is about each individuals will, every one is different. Some people have addictive personalities , some dont. I take any where from one 30mg roxy a day to none, for moths at a time, and ive no mental addiction to them, or any opiate. <br /><br />Now as far as physical addiction, thats another story, opiates take as little as 2 uses to develop mild forms of physical addiction. You just have learn to tune in with your body, and learn to ease your self off of them by gradually reducing your dose and how often you dose. As you stated if you take 1 30 a day for a week, by the 7th day if you dont dose, you will have almost full blown opiate withdrawal, kicking like a junky. Good luck friend.

				Come on dude, one blue per day for 3-4 days at a time isnt a binge and not nearly enough time to grow physically dependent. We are talking consistant use for weeks or months, and getting sick as a dog with flu-like symptoms after not getting your dose...knowing full well the only thing to making you well would be more opiates.<br /><br />I agree that I hope you never experience such an addiction, but you advocating chipping like that are coming far too close to the flame to not get burned.<br /><br />Yes, the best way to not INEVITABLY get hooked is to abstain.

We are talking consistant use for weeks or months, and getting sick as a dog with flu-like symptoms after not getting your dose...knowing full well the only thing to making you well would be more opiates.<br /><br />I agree that I hope you never experience such an addiction, but you advocating chipping like that are coming far too close to the flame to not get burned.<br /><br />Yes, the best way to not INEVITABLY get hooked is to abstain. Still you have nof answered my question, how long have you been using? If in 2 more years, you have to stop, who is to say it will be easy? and i doubt 30mg 3-4 days in a row will not get your rocks off anymore, make that 3-4 times a day.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve been doing the 3-4 day 30mg Roxy a month thing for over a decade.

To see how much self control I really do have and to see if I have an addictive personality, which I believe I do not. I have done this test with crystal meth and I passed. Shit I still have half the bag of crystal left, its just been sittin in my drug treasure chest. I have no desire to do any so I&#039;m just saving it for a rainy day. Heroin I heard was a different ballgame so I wanted to try it out. I have full confidence I will not be purchasing again when this bag is done.
