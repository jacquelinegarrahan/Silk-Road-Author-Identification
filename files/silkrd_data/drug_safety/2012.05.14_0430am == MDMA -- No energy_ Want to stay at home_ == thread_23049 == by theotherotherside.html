				Hey all,<br /><br />Before stumbling upon the road, I got all my &quot;MDMA&quot; on the streets, and it always had me super chatty and active. Obviously cut with who knows what.<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve only ordered some MDMA from Tony, and though it&#039;s definitely weak (had to weigh out close to 250mg and I&#039;m not super experienced), I ended up just wanting to chill at home and listen to music. No energy to do anything! Even left a club after less than an hour on one ocassion. <br /><br />I have an order from PremiumDutch on the way, and though I&#039;m sure that it&#039;s better quality, I&#039;m starting to think that MDMA alone might not make me want to dance and party all night long.<br /><br />Question is: Do you think that this is a consequence of Tony&#039;s MDMA being kind of weak, or do I need to mix something into my roll, and if so, what (product and vendor recommendations would be nice).

				MDMA used to be known as &quot;the relaxing amphetamine&quot;.<br /><br />If you have true blue MDMA which is not stepped on with some speed or other stim, you will probably wind up floored and just want to lay down and chat. That being said, if it is pure MDMA, you would experience these effects at a dose much lower than 250mg... <br /><br />I suspect his product was just very cut. <br /><br />When you get some really really clean MDMA it will feel somewhat like a weird, bizarre, loving, distant relative of an opiate high. All you need to do is add a little dopaminergic stimulation in the mix and you&#039;re set - get some Adderall!

				It could be MDEA, if it has a stoning and can&#039;t be arsed effect that may explain it because MDEA has a stoning profile.<br /><br />Try Ivory, his is the boss.<br /><br />If it was cut (I doubt it was cut, you don&#039;t cut MDMA you just get bad synths mostly) it was probably banged full of by products and not washed and thus weak.

				Well PD is supposed to be good so I guess I&#039;ll see if that&#039;s any different. My next order will likely be from Skyy once I have seven transactions for escrow (currently sitting at 5). So you guys figure some quality M won&#039;t have such a stoning effect and thus I won&#039;t need to mix in another drug? I&#039;m going to order some K from Reich pretty soon... that might be fun.<br /><br />Aderall is super expensive. Shiiiit.

				This is generally how pure MDMA feels..usually when you get tablets there&#039;s a fair bit of some other stimulant in there, just enough to get you wanting to dance around, simply move. The few doses of pure MDMA i&#039;ve had have all felt like that..reaaal relaxing, not very stimulating at all. <br />Although, I have to disagree with GreenPEAS....it feels nothing like an opiate high in my opinion.

				Yeah, don&#039;t let tony&#039;s MDMA shape your impressions. I ordered his, and in comparison to what I&#039;ve tried from other vendors it was cat piss. Either not actually MDMA or cut to hell with something inert. There were a few of us that posted in his review thread but everyone was so preoccupied sucking his dick that it went largely unnoticed and everyone kept saying he had the best molly on the road. Granted - I was on that bandwagon for a little bit, so I shouldn&#039;t be talking lol. Oh well, live and learn. <br /><br />But yeah, +1 for Ivory. Seriously, it&#039;s the shit. 150mg and another 50mg booster had me rolling face. His shipping is ridiculous too. Comes across the pond in literally 3 days. <br /><br />He also calls me Mate in his PMs. Nuff said. ;)<br /><br />Pure MDMA should, in my experience, be perfect for any setting. I can take it and lay on a couch with some friends, I can take it and rage for hours. Very versatile substance. I&#039;d also encourage you to try dosing a medium amount of 2c-b 3 or 4 hours into your roll. It rocks my socks.

The feeling of everything being alright with the world, the desire to just kind of lay down, the deep in my chest and stomach &quot;rolling&quot; feeling. I dunno, it&#039;s probably not the best descriptor, but at least to me I see this faint similarity in the &quot;language&quot; of the high - particularly when speedballing.<br /><br />I think the truest comparison would be the feeling you get when you hit that perfect level of psychedelic euphoria and feel like everything is in its place and you have love for everything (for me the closest has been mescaline). Just instead of coming and going, it&#039;s consistent for the experience and more forcefully loving.

				I would agree with most of what was said here. I had some of Tony&#039;s MDMA (but later got scammed by him at the 4/20 sale), and I took 150g + 50g an hour later and it was an okay roll--not that great, but it was something. Definitely wasn&#039;t mixed with speed, but I didn&#039;t roll that hard either. Anyway...<br /><br />Usually, I like to take Adderall before taking MDMA, and it gets me rolling with some great energy. If you want to dance like crazy person, the Adderall will give you the energy to do so. Plus, I think it&#039;s safer to take prescription Adderall instead of some speedy E pill.<br /><br />Tip: use the IR (instant release) Adderall instead of the XR (extended release). If you take Adderall XR you won&#039;t be able to sleep for 12-16 hours.
