				I was wondering what is the difference between amphetamine sulfate and amphetamine paste? Because when I googled it, I kind of got the idea they are both the same thing. But what confuses me is that I read on some vendor&#039;s page and also on WWW that amphetamine can reach a maximum of around 72% purity, but then I saw this sulfate being sold at SR (silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/79c8a878c2) and it claims to be almost 100% pure. <br /><br />And how much weight would a sulfate loss after drying? Paste loses about 30-40% I think, ofcourse it depends how much it was dried before.<br /><br />thanks

				That 72% thing means it&#039;s 72% pure amphetamine but it&#039;s the same as saying 100% pure amphetamine sulfate, because sulfate accounts for 28% of amphetamine sulfate&#039;s weight.. The advertised 72% pure amphetamine are 99% pure bullshit though.<br />The only ones that have pretty pure amphetamine right now (that I know of) are boymaster and capecrusader.. Their stuff have been determined to be around 80-90% purity (of amphetamine sulfate). And oddly, they&#039;re the only ones that don&#039;t call it 72% pure speed :P I can&#039;t load your link right now though so I can&#039;t really take a look. And paste loses about 30% usually yeah.. <br />Most guys ship it as paste so that they actually sell you less stuff without having to add even more caffeine/lactose/whatever to make more profits.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a website with lab tests of speed and coke vendors :<br />http://braqrsskizlusigz.onion/ <br /><br />UPDATE : The link you provided IS from boymaster x) Well, you&#039;re good with that one, his stuff is pretty dams pure, even though it varies from batch to batch, it&#039;s never cut with caffeine. According to the test results at least.
