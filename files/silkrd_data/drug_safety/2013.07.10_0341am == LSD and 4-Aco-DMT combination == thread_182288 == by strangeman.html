				I couldn&#039;t find anything on the forums about this particular combo, so I thought I&#039;d share a recent experience with this in case anybody else is thinking about it. A little background: I&#039;ve done some fairly intense doses of LSD (up to around 500ug) and I&#039;ve had some really interesting hallucinations, but never anything really overwhelming. Also, I&#039;ve done 4-Aco by itself and with Methylone, Weed and one time JWH-18 (which was a really weird experience, but not particularly visual). My wife always enjoys 4-aco and she gets crazy visuals. I, on the other hand, have always found 4-Aco to be pretty disappointing in the visuals department, so this time around I thought I&#039;d see if combining it with LSD kicked it up a notch. <br /><br />So here&#039;s what happened: About noon I take ~240ug of LSD. I trip for a while and then we have dinner. My wife was going to take some of the 4-aco with me, but she decides she&#039;s not in the right mindset. At around T+5 hours, squarely in the middle of my LSD peak, I take approximately 20mg of 4-Aco. I&#039;ve taken this dose before and found it profoundly meh. I usually need 30mgs to even make it worth my while. Thankfully my wife talked me out of the larger dose.<br /><br />We sit down to watch some cartoons and wait for me to hit the 4-Aco peak before. Somewhere between T+6 and T+6:30, shit goes completely sideways. Words can&#039;t do justice to the shit that I was seeing, and I&#039;ve forgotten most of the internal monologue that accompanied it. Halos of kaleidoscopic light filled the room. At the edges of my vision holes burned open like the cigarette burns in old movies, but bigger and more stable, ringed with shimmering rainbow color. Inside the holes there&#039;s an incredible depth, like the night sky if there were no stars.&nbsp; The room was breathing, and completely suffused with light. I could feel the weight of the light on me and at times the room appeared to be shrinking. The walls were changing colors, shifting, deeply saturated pastels, mostly green, red and orange. <br /><br />While all this is happening, I am very quietly losing my fucking marbles. I remember thinking I must have taken way more than 20mg and that I&#039;d poisoned myself. Also frogs. Fuck me if I know what that was about, but I kept seeing frogs when I closed my eyes (basically every time I blinked), along with a fractal spinning triangle pattern. I wish I&#039;d spent more time appreciating the CEVs, because they were the most detailed I&#039;ve ever had. <br /><br />Meanwhile, I can&#039;t really follow what&#039;s going on on the TV anymore, but it gives me a vaguely bad feeling that rapidly magnifies. At this point, there are some gaps in my memory. Apparently I wandered around the house and could only speak coherently for short bursts. I don&#039;t remember talking to my wife at all after I got off the couch and said something like &quot;Let&#039;s do something else, this feels bad,&quot; but according to her she was trying to communicate with me the whole time. This may have gone on for like 30 minutes. At some point my wife got me to take 1mg of Xanax (that I don&#039;t actually remember taking), which takes everything down about a dozen notches. <br /><br />In retrospect, I would have liked to ride things out and see where it went, but I was getting some crazy-ass mood swings and could not sit still for anything.&nbsp; Anybody else out there tried this combo and have similar results?

				The LSD was Jannis. The 4-Aco was kwiktrip, if anybody wants to replicate the experiment. (Not that I recommend it. The better angels of my reason told me this was not a bright idea, but I never listen to that guy.) Kwiktrip has acid, too,&nbsp; or did last time I looked, anyway. <br /><br />Also, addendum: A few days after the experiment, I get higher off weed than I used to.
