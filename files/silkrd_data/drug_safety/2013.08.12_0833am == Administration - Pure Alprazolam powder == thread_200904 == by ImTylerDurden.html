				I am considering dipping into the Xanax/Alprazolam market. I noticed the alprazolam powder is much cheaper than actual xanax bars. Obviously it is a waste to snort xanax bars since it is so much powder to snort up. But, is the alprazolam powder worth snorting? I read a few things saying xanax is not water soluble and it wont work and blah blah blah. But I couldn&#039;t find anything specifically on snorting the pure powder. Can it just be put under the tongue to dissolve? Or does it have to be capped to reach the stomach for maximum effect? Is a filler 100% necessary?&nbsp; Would it be more worth it to slang bags of this powder locally or go with the bars? <br /><br />Also, who are the best vendors for Alprazolam, for both bars and powder, at the moment? I see some selling bars for $5 USD each and some selling for just over a dollar per bar. what gives with the huge price differential? <br /><br />TL;DR: How alprazolam powder can be administerd. pro&#039;s/con&#039;s of pure alprazolam powder and bars. best vendors for both products for local resale purposes.

				Powders not worth as much. People want the bars intact whole. How are they going to know they&#039;re bars? How are you going to know how much to weigh out a bar?<br />Answering your other questions, yes you can snort it. Yes you can chew it, put it under your tongue, ect.<br />$5 USD is usually what a bar goes for on the street. $6 if you&#039;re lucky. So if people are selling them for even $3, jump on that shit!

I can cap up anything and sell it off and people are willing to take the risk because theres nobody around that sells xanax consistently. All I have to do is sell off good shit for a moderately fair price and they will come back, even if it is powder in a capsule.

				True<br />Go for it if you think you can. Personally, I&#039;d buy the real things, though. Especially if you can get them for cheap like you mentioned

				If you&#039;re going to sell alprazolam powder you&#039;re going to want to sell at least 100mg at a time in my opinion. You&#039;re going to need extremely high quality milligram scales to do 2mgs at a time and you are going to loose A LOT to spillage and spend hours packing tiny caps for little profit when it comes to adding in the labor. Go get some flour or any other powder and weigh out 100mg then try weigh 2mg and see how hard it is to do.

I think people would be a little skeptical about buying a pin amount of powder inside of a capsule. They want the appearance of the actual Xanax bar.<br /><br />It&#039;s really not that much powder to snort up. People that are willing to snort it don&#039;t really mind the amount of powder they are snorting.<br /><br />I&#039;d go with bars.

				It&#039;s not worth snorting because the body will not absorb it faster nor in a higher percentage then taking it orally. The only benzo worth snorting is midazolam. Now dosing alprazolam powder safely is not that easy. I would really not just cut it with any other powder and hope for the best :P.<br /><br />The easy way to dose it is to dissolve it in propylenglycol or something similiar and then via drop vial.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine how you would resale xanax powder beeing dissolved tho.<br /><br />Regarding powder I can warmly recommend the vendor Caslava (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7e974b5837)<br /><br /><br />edit: if you are thinking about just reselling like 100 mg bags, I&#039;d really advice you not to. People usually have no idea how to handle such things, they might be in for an unpleasant surprise.

A 3 cm line is too much. This is a clever idea from a powder vendor - 50 X 1mg blotters<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/60cb83677a

				HA the powder is quite tricky.&nbsp; You never know you might end up falling asleep behind a police station for a cop to wake you up on his way to work to tell you to go home.&nbsp; I am not sure how you would go about snorting 2 mg of any substance also xanax has such a high bio availability it is almost useless to try and take it any other way.<br />

				Dude you&#039;d need an extremely good milligram scale to weigh out less than .005g at a time and it would also be a BITCH to cap 1 and 2 mg at a time. You&#039;d have to make a liquid solution, then you could drop that onto like sour patch kids or something. But I&#039;d just go with bars. Xanax king sells 1k bars (they&#039;re a copy but he claims they are all at least 2mg and usually stronger) for only $1,050. I&#039;m about to buy 1k of them as soon as this M1 gets here and I flip some. Stoked as fuck on this deal, my city is boutta be barred the fuck out.
