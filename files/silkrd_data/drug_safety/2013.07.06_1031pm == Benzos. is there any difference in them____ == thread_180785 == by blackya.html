				I was thinking to order some benzos in case of a come-down or sleeping disorders.<br /><br />But there are so many different names and brands: Lorazepam, Diazepam; Xanax, Alprazolam, Apaurine, Etizolam and so on...<br /><br />Is there really a difference in them?<br />I mean for example one would stronger, the other one would maybe give headache or hangover afterwards, the third one would be too weak/too strong and so on.<br /><br />Or are they all the same and produce all in all the same effect on the body?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				All benzodiazapenes are pretty similar.<br />Lorazepam is the generic name for Ativan<br />Diazepam is Valium<br />Alprazolam is Xanax<br />and I&#039;ve never messed with Etizolam but I heard its very similar to Clonazepam (Klonopin) as it&#039;s a little longer acting and has some beneficial muscle relaxant properties as well.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just coming down from MDMA or speed bender, I&#039;d just get some Xanax. They&#039;ve always got the job done for me. <br /><br />If you&#039;re having chronic sleep issues though you could try Klonopin given it has a longer half life but because of that they always made me feel &#039;groggy&#039; or &#039;brain fog&#039; in the morning. At the end of the day they&#039;re mechanisms all effect you the same. <br /><br />They are extremely difficult to shake if you become dependent on them though. Just a warning.

				They all have different strengths and durations.&nbsp; The effects are sometimes very similar but not all of them.&nbsp; For example, chlordiazepoxide is nothing like any other benzo.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken eight 30mg chlordiazepoxide pills and I didn&#039;t feel anything.

				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_benzodiazepines + checking out the attributes ( hypnotic, anti convulsant, etc)<br /><br />diazepam is good for getting through the day, keeping you calm and functioning <br />alprazolam is good for a comedown and to sleep<br />rohypnol (brand name) is extremely euphoric when dosed properly<br />etc

				There&#039;s so many different god damn benzos that i like to keep a couple of each and customize my intoxication based on my desired effects! Shit boy if you&#039;re benzo naive and fuck about you end up as the kind of kid that takes ambien or temazepam at noon and blacks out and wakes up in jail for huffing whipped cream cans in a Wal-mart. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seent it.

				For me, clonazapam is pure grace.<br /><br />The rest that I&#039;ve tried... not so much. I can easily looe a week of my time on this so called alprazolam powder.

				For me, 100mg Valium barely effects me but I love Xanax.&nbsp; Klonopin are nice too.

				They all effect everyone differently so you may have to experiment and find the one you like. I used to take a lot of xanax but I quit them for over a year and now a half mg makes me want to sleep. A blue football gets me all pissed off at everyone and then I feel groggy all day the next day along with bad times in the bathroom.<br /><br />I get headaches from the come down off valume. I tried etizolam and found it to be more like a sleeping pill<br /><br />I just don&#039;t agree with benzos and take them on rare occasions. I don&#039;t even care for them when crashing from a multi night no sleep crash or to gear up for a psychedelic event<br /><br />Coming soon my vendor account with lots of xanax for sale

				As mentioned above, Intensity &amp; Duration!<br /><br />For example, I was originally prescribed Ativan to treat my anxiety. It&#039;s a long-lasting benzo of moderate strength that should&#039;ve kept me calm throughout the day.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m prone to random spikes of VERY high anxiety. I was switched to Xanax, which is more powerful and helps me a lot more. However, it does last a shorter period of time and is therefore more addictive. I have, however, managed to take it infrequently enough that I&#039;ve not developed an addiction, albeit I have a slight tolerance.<br /><br />Finally, to go completely non-medical- I&#039;ve heard that Valium is the best muscle relaxant for sex, in regards to chicks and gay bottoms taking dick.

				Ok, I see! Got your point, guys!<br /><br />Its more about those nasty and long-lasting come-downs one gets when partying too hard and too long, like after C for example<br />I used to stop any come-down with Heroin but lol, got addicted to it and it took a while to get off it. Weed is good for coming down but sometimes it feels its not strong enough to fight against the pure chemistry inside of my body&nbsp; :o ;D<br />anyway I thought I try benzos next time I take acid, xtc or coke to see if it can relax and come down body and sole.<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; ;)<br />
