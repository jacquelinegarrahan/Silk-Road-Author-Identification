				Has anyone had any complaints using tony76&#039;s LSD? I know it&#039;s been a while since anyone would have bought it as he made his famous Houdini act, but did anyone ever had any untoward effects from it?<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				The first few batches got nothing but rave reviews that I recall, towards the end though who knows, it could have morphed into something else entirely. Why do you ask?

				Even though I never had tried LSD before that, I had what I thought (and still think) were strange effects, not the least of which was an exceedingly long duration, approaching twenty four hours from one pane of (supposedly) 100 micros. Could the fact that I never had LSD before (but have had mushrooms numerous times, as well as Salvia) account for this?<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				I had one of momiji&#039;s 100ug blotters. They were described as &quot;tony&#039;s acid&quot;. My friend and I each took HALF of one blotter along with lots of bud and alcohol, and both of us tripped balls for like 10-12 hours. This was my first time using any major hallucinogen other than a small dose of shrooms. However, my friend has done 2-CI or 2-CB, lots of shrooms, and some other strange shit and even he was floored by the supposed ~50ug dose. There is no way any of this was placebo. At first it felt like I was just extremely high, but then I was seeing entire landscapes--complete with animated skulls and simmering caves that go on forever--inside of hot coals, paintings were melting and turning into other shit, distant sounds appeared to come from nearby, everything was brightened, colors were intense, plus all the introspective emotional shit although we were too busy discussing the freaky effects to delve into personal stuff too much.

You can have lingering effects for LSD for many hours after if you can&#039;t fall asleep, but you shouldn&#039;t be peaking for more then 8-10. What blotters where they? The first batch were the some sort of multi colored mayan dot&#039;s, those I&#039;m pretty sure were legit. The next batches like I said, who knows, with him going rogue its hard to tell what happened.

				Peak is hard to say, but I was very &quot;stoned&quot;, with the typical numbness of face I usually feel on psychedelics, for as I said close to 24 hours. It was a very tiny multicolored pane and I got it from a reseller of tony&#039;s lsd whose name escapes me at the moment.<br /><br />I started to get very worried at the length of it, which only exacerbated the uncomfortableness of the unsetlling imagery I had, some of the most unpleasant and even repulsive eidetic images I&#039;ve ever experienced unfortunately.<br /><br />The whole thing made me feel that maybe it wasn&#039;t lsd but something else or even contaminated with something else. Like DOB for instance, isn&#039;t this an extremely long-lasting compound? Course that&#039;s a phenethylamine not an indole, and the experience was indeed indole-like in many ways.<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				Tony&#039;s blotters were the best I&#039;ve ever had. Super clean and strong crystal. I had one of the first batches, so I can&#039;t speak about the ones around the time he went scammer, but I would give anything for a sheet of the shit he started selling. If you&#039;re curious about the print, check out 3Jane&#039;s thread for a pic of her most recent listing - it&#039;s the same print as the one that Tony had. I snagged some of that and I&#039;m really hoping that they&#039;re the same crystal or laid by the same chemist.
