				About time we got some good press.<br /><br />Tonight I had to go to a Business Cocktail event&nbsp; Europe, full of British ex pats abroad upper class Tory arseholes. I dropped 50mg of MDMA, and 10mg of 2C-b.<br /><br />Worked the room, sold my sustainable company vision, made 2 sales and kept people employed.<br /><br />A good day.<br /><br />With minimal side effects, get that from alcohol you sanctimonious bunch of right wing twats...<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				I suppose the difference between someone &#039;being really enthousiastic&#039; and &#039;someone being on dope&#039; is mostly in the ear/eye of the beholder ;)<br /><br />That said, i can think of plenty of business situations where drugs of some kind can be beneficial. It could be taking some xanax before public speaking if you are affraid of that, to taking stimulants that allow you to pitch the same idea 20 times in a row.

				I have a positive drug story. <br /><br />I took some drugs.. and it was awesome! <br /><br />Also, I didn&#039;t die, lose my job, kill anyone or steal any VCR&#039;s. <br /><br />The end.

				I like the idea of using small does to gain therapeutic&nbsp; results.<br /><br />MDMA has been used in this way before, I can operate a lot easier socially on a low dose of MDMA. 40-50 mg takes the edge off and make me interested and pleasant around other people without any visible on drugs effect.<br /><br />The 2C-B smooths out the come down and drags the peak effects a little long and keeps things a little sharper.<br /><br />Be nice to see if other people use drugs to medicate/improve their lives. I mean getting fucked up safely just to get fucked up is good as well. We all need to turn off now an again.

				cannabis allowed me to experience relief for the first time after years of sickness. since i&#039;ve been using psychedelics (psilocybin mushrooms, lsd, dmt mostly) i&#039;ve cured my chronic depression and feel better than i have in years. tread with caution, respect these divine chemicals. always pay respect and you will see what you need to see.&nbsp; ;D

				I suppose &#039;taking the edge off&#039; is something broadly shared between people that have positive experience with drugs of many kinds.<br /><br />Also, i think this is a very important aspect, as it allows people to use substances in very moderate amounts enhancing their qualtiy of life, as opposed to taking amounts that get you absolutely wasted (for fun) without having any benefit on the long term.
