				I have tested some pills from candy shop, streetpharmacy, and SKYY. <br />I&#039;m scared as I&#039;ve seen the results, because they have not the dose which they have wrote!<br /><br />8 ) Streetpharmacy´s Sonic have a dose of 60mg (wrote 135mg) and this is&nbsp; not correct from this vendor<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to write this. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pills are normal dosed with MDMA. No other substance !!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think good pills but it´s not correct to lie with the dose.<br /><br />9 ) SKYY has only good feedback´s so I wonder why the pink stars&nbsp; are so bad.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They contain 57mg MDMA, little bit MDME and a little bit caffeine. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He write that they have 160mg and they were custom made for SR.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;this is more than unfair to lie.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />10 ) Candy´s defqon are the only pills who have nearly the correct dose of 152mg (wrote 170mg) ,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but every pill can have +/- some mg.&nbsp; Only MDMA !!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Correct seller with top pills and you can buy them without problems.<br /><br />You can see the test results on this links:<br /><br />8 ) http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=042b99f414e5800524ff5c93420b7603.jpg%22%3EThe%20Image%3C/a%3E<br /><br />9 ) http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=3766118cca393f1c7e5f004f0af7d677.jpg&quot;&gt;The Image&lt;/a&gt; <br /><br />10 ) http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=0bb9dc3bd389c53002be773e1bde782e.jpg&quot;&gt;The Image&lt;/a&gt;<br /><br /><br />I hope I can help with the results and buyer think about to bring the drugs to a test senter.<br />If you are a seller pls be correct and don´t cheat your customs..<br /><br />***********************UPDATE**********************UPDATE******************************UPDATE****************************<br /><br />Many people here thought I faked the test results and I work with a vendor!<br />After some time &quot;check it&quot; made some test results public and post them on their homepage,so here you can see the results they have tested..<br /><br />http://www.checkyourdrugs.at/aktuelles/warnungen-jannerfebruar-2012/<br /><br />Than click on the orange &quot;hier&quot; and than open the pdf<br /><br />Normally I would shit on it, but this is for everyone who wrote I´m a liar.<br /><br /><br />Regards

				Thanks for getting them tested.<br /><br />SKYY sent me a couple of stars, the one I tested had closer to 120mg in, might have been my sloppy technique but I wouldn&#039;t have been 60mg out. A friend ate the other and it definitely worked- big pupils, empathy, euphoria etc and 57mg wouldn&#039;t have had any effect. Maybe the MDMA and binder weren&#039;t mixed thoroughly so the spread is wider over the batch? Maybe someone else could get another tested?

				Yes I also wonder and they can have +/- mg in it, so it could be that in other pills are 80 or 90.<br />But normally it is about 10mg lower or higher.<br />If you eat a pill with 60mg you also get stoned and the most pills are about 50-90mg.<br />At this party were 30+ pills tested and only the defqon had more than 100mg!!

				The test results are 99.9% true! You go into a tent and then they test it and you <br />get the numbers with your pills.<br />(they take numbers instead photos because there are so many pills with the same logo)<br />They sent the tests to the AKH hospital and after 1-2 h they stick the <br />results to a wall.

				This seems awfully fishy... CandyShop posting the review and this thread only praising his product. As posted before, the writing style is highly similar. It&#039;s a conflict of interest. Maybe the milligram dosage isn&#039;t right, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;re as off as you&#039;re making them.

				I wasn&#039;t aware that there was any sort of accurate testing methodology that allowed results on upwards of 30 pills in under two hours. I&#039;d want to send it to a lab that I specifically asked, so to speak, rather than one that was just offering at a party.

				The methodology is on the website: www.checkyourdrugs.at<br /><br />The pill is weighed and measured and a small sample of the pill is scraped off. This sample is weighed then put through an HPLC. <br />The HPLC will have an assay set up whereby the recorded peaks are integrated and their retention times compared to a reference assay. <br /><br />Depending on the column and solvent system, MDMA could come off within a few minutes, so 1 machine could conceivably run 10 samples an hour. <br /><br /><br />BUT- herein lies the problem:<br /><br />If I were to analyse a pill by this method, it would be destructive testing- the entire pill would be ground to a homogeneous powder, then 10 mg of this homogeneous powder would be analysed to ensure that the distribution of MDMA to binder was even.<br /><br />However in this testing method, only a small sample is scraped from the surface of the pill and&nbsp; there maybe a very uneven distribution of binder to MDMA. <br /><br />

				Pls don´t say that I work with someone together, because it is not true and what mean you with writing style is highly similar??<br />We all writing English here and I have 50+ orders on my acc. So why should I do something with my acc to help someone??<br />For free samples?? If I would do this I would search for someone with coke! LoL<br />Here are the vendors with the DEFQONS: schizofreen, candy shop, aakoven, PremiumDutch<br />And from all of this vendors candy I know his package, never buy from schizofreen again at my last order(1-2month) he don´t have a vacuum machine<br />and his package was relay poor. Should I order from all this vendors only to give a feedback??<br />I don´t wanted that candy post my feedback, but If it is a problem for someone pls write him to delete it !!<br /><br />I wrote to SKYY that I will delete my feedback if there are other test results, but from hundreds of people here I was the first who go<br />to a drug test.<br />I have one pink star left and this pill I will sent to a test center. I only know one but, if someone know a better pls post!<br />This test I found in Switzerland: http://www.ecstasydata.org/ <br />But i don´t think that they have made mistakes maybe 10mg +/-<br />If they would make so much mistakes they would be not allowed! Let&#039;s just say they made so much mistakes and tested<br />a pill with 160mg and they write they have 60mg. A girl with 50kg ate this tested pill and suck down or go crazy??<br />They want to help people and would rather more than to low. This party checks could not exist If they would made so big mistakes!<br /><br /><br />

				I think the question here has already been answered in the post of the method of testing &quot;a small section of the pill is is scraped off and tested with the binder&quot;.<br /><br />You could cut a pill in half and have like 100mg in one half and 30mg in the other half, this is not proper drug testing. At proper drug testing centers they test the whole pill for the actual amount, not just making up some random results.<br /><br />Not even possible to roll of such a low amount.

				They give you the option- if you want to, you can scrape off a small amount of the pill to be analysed and they weigh the pill before and after. <br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m not investing any more time in this. I&#039;m pretty sure the pills aren&#039;t 60mg and to be honest I don&#039;t care. I&#039;ll eat one on Friday and report back. Aside from that, I&#039;m out of this.

At proper drug testing centers they test the whole pill for the actual amount, not just making up some random results.<br /><br />Not even possible to roll of such a low amount.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would love to see you sit there for 50 hours watching the solvated contents of an entire pill run through the elution column of an HPLC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pills ... or anything are tested the way he said, a very small quantity of the substance is solvated and run through the column.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they weighed the pill before and afterwards, the HPLC report&#039;s there&#039;s lets say 500nanograms of MDMA ... then you do some basic math to extrapolate the entire pill&#039;s mass of MDMA.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any pill that hasn&#039;t been mixed to complete homogeneity is firstly dangerous, and secondly nobody would buy&nbsp; them as they&#039;re garbage.&nbsp; The people that press pills mix them beforehand so that if there&#039;s 500ng of MDMA in one 2mg scraping of a pill there will be 500ng of MDMA in any other scraping (homogenecity ?????).<br /><br />Anyways, moving along to things of relevance, how often do you think this testing group that makes you go into a tent replaces their HPLC elution columns?&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna go with .. never (yes yes I know NaOH will elute a column, but they still need to be replaced about annually).&nbsp; Can you ask them for the elution profile next time, and not .. some sheet with number&#039;s that just &#039;says&#039; it has that much.&nbsp; Any analytical use of an HPLC will produce an elution profile, which they could easily print/take a picture/etc. of.

				Seems a bit weird that the Red/Pink Stars SKYY is selling would be that low in MDMA. First of all, how come people would be giving him that good feedback from shit pills like that? As far as I&#039;ve understood, the stars have been told to be quite good from the opinion of the people who have tried them. <br />I&#039;m hoping someone else could run a test for them too so we could get an definite answer. In the mean time, I&#039;d rather trust his almost 100% good feedback rather than this guys test. No offense to the tester at all, the work you&#039;re doing is really valuable for our community.

				The checkyourdrugs results are from the same test as was posted here a few weeks back. Whilst it&#039;s entirely possible it was a bunk pill, there&#039;s also some shortcomings with the testing method. If someone in NL could take one of these to another test center, this could be cleared up.<br /><br />I have absolutely no agenda and no reason to side with SKYY but I did eat one of the stars last Friday and they are without doubt at least 100mg and felt more like 110/120.

				I agree with wowzers.<br />We do not know how they test it and if they take just a small chunk, test are inconclusive.<br />That still can only be information on this web site and we do not know exact method, step by step test.<br />Homemade pill presses, unexpensive equipment and people who actually make those pill can use not standard methods and low grade and non applicable adulterants.<br />That cause low quality pills. Mass are not homogenous and with same quantity in each one.<br />Even with proper test, we can only speculate how good or bad will be next from the same batch.<br /><br />In pdf submited article its interesting that speed is around 10% typical and coke is pretty pure.<br />Those heroin pills are interesting also, but its now allowed to disclose purity results, shame.

				Yes I also think that SKYY`s pills have more than 60mg, it could be that I got a low pill.<br />I posted this pdf because so many people wrote that I faked the results and that is not true and I don´t <br />want that someone think candy work with me!<br />But shit on it!<br /><br />Next week is the next &quot;check it&quot; date and I will ask them many questions about there doing!<br />Than I will post it...<br />I will&nbsp; test the Speakers and pfandleier´s pills and I will crush them.<br />I also think about to order H or coke, don´t know??
