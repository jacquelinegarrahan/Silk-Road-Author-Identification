				I&#039;m getting an Opana 40 ER from Pharmville tomorrow (those guys are the shit, btw) and I&#039;ve been searching here and at opiophile for the best way(s) to prepare it for insufflation and am having a hard time. I know I could just crush it and snort it, but there is the issue of gelling, i guess? Does the oven/freezer method apply or is the time release mechanism altogether different from that in the OPs? Is the IPA extraction method people use for IVing worth it for insufflation? Any other tips?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I insufflated a small amount of Opana ER a few years back and had no problem with gelling. Just don&#039;t get the pill wet beforehand.<br />I don&#039;t know if anything has changed with the formulation. BTW it kicked my ass and I was railing 300+mg OC a day. So be careful. start small.

				Just grind it up using a ped egg(spelling?), or hose clamp.&nbsp; Then divide into lines and snort.&nbsp; They work just like the old OCs, but be careful as the bioavailability is much greater when snorted compared to oral.&nbsp; Also, be aware of your tolerance and look up an opiate conversion so you don&#039;t do too much.&nbsp; And FYI, the conversion charts usually only include oral and IM/IV routes of administration, but if you know the bioavailabilities of each ROA you can do the maths to calculate the proper dosage.&nbsp; Which, from wikipedia, they are &quot;Bioavailability, 10% (oral) 40% (Intranasal) 100% (IV, IM).&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used a needle before, but knowing the extreme bioavailability of oxymorphone I&#039;m very tempted to try it.

				does oxycodone have a 100% bioavailability IM? It has a mean intranasal bioavailability of 46% compared to 40% for oxymorphone, so then the IV conversion would be approximately the same using the calculator (e.g. http://www.medcalc.com/narcotics.html) if oxycodone IV was also 100%...

				Yeah it doesn&#039;t sound like a very big risk when you look at the numbers for infrequent use. Someone remind me not to buy Opana very often ;)<br /><br />This quote from the bluelight link caused me to read it twice: &quot;There is one single case report that might be relevant - 20 year old woman intentionally used Ajax (95% silica by weight) intranasally for 5 years and developed silicosis.&quot; WTF?! Anyway, by comparison Opana is 2% silica.

				Remember, Opana is much better/stronger than oxycodone. IT will&nbsp; only get more expensive and more rare. Im surprised on how inexpensive it still is. If you haven&#039;t tried opana and want to, I would jump on the chance, because I see in the not too distant future that the opana 40mg will be much higher than 100 per pill. (still worth it)<br /><br />I cant keep mine in stock. I also know that other vendors don&#039;t have an endless supply, so, if you see it, not only would I buy one, I would buy as many as I could afford. because one day those suckers will be in the 150 dollar range.

				I ran across this cus of the new formulation situation and doing experimenting with different teks, you can read my thread in the product offers section but I think I have had some success with a new completely DRY etoh tek that I&#039;ve been messing around with.&nbsp; I started with a 40mg new &quot;skittle&quot; pill and ended up with ~25mg of IMHO pretty pure opana powder... I&#039;m going to test more but I think I may be close to posting a working tek soon!<br /><br />PS. the opana powder I ended up with was definitely active!&nbsp; It&#039;s just about working on getting the best yield now...

				Be careul with opanas...&nbsp; When I first started them a couple months ago I could get 40mg pills for 30$ ... One tiny line would have me flying and 1 pill would last a day or two, sometimes 3, between my boyfriend and I.... At the point where I am now it takes almost a full 40mg pill to get me nodding, and you can&#039;t find them for less than 70-80$ a piece! I&#039;ve spent thousands of dollars on them in the past couple months thanks to SR...&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to have your DOC so easily accessible and that&#039;s the beauty of SR, but it is soooo hard to stop when they&#039;re just a few clicks away... But back to opana, be careful and set a limit for yourself so your tolerance doesn&#039;t skyrocket. Once you get to the point where 40mg of oxymorphone doesn&#039;t get you off there really isn&#039;t much else out there that will. I even tried some H to hold me until my next appt with my sub dr., thinking it would last.... I had never done it before so I just ordered a small batch to start with, 1/4g. I snorted lines all day and barely got a nod by the end of the night when it was all gone. Bummer. Enjoy opana and get the good ones while you can, but be careful and never forget how powerful the drug is!!
