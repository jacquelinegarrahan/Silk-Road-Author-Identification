				I used marquis reagent today on two different samples of mdma from different people both from the same country. Both went form an olive color to jet black instantly. The thing that really got my attention was the jet black had a dark green color around the edges as opposed to the normal purple around the edges that Im used to seeing from my home country. <br /><br />I know marquis turns black with brown around the edges when cut with meth/speed. Could this mean my mdma is cut with 2c-b/i ? Is the problem my testing kit? Im new to this.

				I don&#039;t know what green means for a marquis reageant. If green means 2C-B then there&#039;s probably traces of it, but chances are the purple and green edges are due to the impurities from the synthesis. Was it tan stuff? If so, it hasn&#039;t been properly washed so there&#039;s still some precursors. I don&#039;t much about reagent testing but cutting with a little 2C-B would make sense... It&#039;d be a better idea than cutting it with meth. Maybe it&#039;s methylone or something like that too.<br />So what does green mean?

				how old is your test?<br />did you store it in a dark place?<br />the tests are sensitive to heat was the place you stored at relatively cool?<br /><br />Id also recommend getting the test combo from dancesafe it has 4 tests for 50. it would help discern exactly what was in it thru trial and error

				My testing kit is brand new right out the box, had it in the freezer for a day. <br /><br />One did have impurities, it was a darker grayish purple color and the other was a bright sparkly white with no smell that seemed to not have impurities. Yes, the chart points to 2c-b being a green, I was thinking methylone as well since the roll seemed shorter then usual but I imagine it would turn a lighter brown since meth/amp turns orange without the presence of mdma and methylone turns yellow.
