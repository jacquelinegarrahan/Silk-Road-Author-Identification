				from my research, which isnt much, psychedelics mechanisms on the brain arent very well understood compared to more simple drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin etc. people say the basically break down the filters of your brain. my question is, how bad are they? how much would one medium dose of LSD effect your brain? people can become &quot;fried&quot; from taking lots of it, so i dont doubt that it is bad for your brain from a purely &quot;health&quot; stance, but i know it can lead to new perspectives that outweigh the potential negative affect on your brain. they just seem way stronger than any normal drug that just gets you high, if DMT can basically put you in another universe then it must be radically altering your brain chemistry much stronger than just simply releasing chemicals that make you feel good. does anybody have anything to say about this?

By that I mean if you have any doubts about your set or setting (that is mindset and physical setting) then you should be extra careful, on top of normal precautions of course. I&#039;ve only ever had one bad trip, and it was BAD. But looking back it was because I was stressed in my everyday life, possibly even depressed (although not technically diagnosed) and so I really shouldn&#039;t have dropped that day. I did still learn something, but it was a lesson of &#039;tough love&#039;...<br /><br />As for my personal physical health, after sleeping off the after effects of a trip I feel positively refreshed. The next few days very little can bother me, and any niggling injuries (sore muscles, cramps, that sort of thing) are gone for at least a week. This could be just the power of a positive mind set after a trip, or it could be something that the drug is actually doing, I&#039;m not sure. I&#039;m not sure the difference would really matter?<br /><br />And one last piece of trivia, there are studies into Psilocybin (the active in shrooms) being used to treat cluster headaches. If you&#039;re not familiar, these are described as being anywhere from 10 to 1000 times worse than a migrane, and can practically incapacitate sufferers for hours at a time. The kicker is that no one has really discovered the cause of these yet (as far as I&#039;ve heard), but psychadelics can&#039;t be too bad if they can help here.&nbsp; At worst this means they&#039;re a medicine with serious side effects. I&#039;ll leave the at best scenario up to the individual though.

				In the UK there&#039;s clinical trials into using certain psychedelics and their respective component compounds as long term anti-depressants. I believe LSD and 2C-B are amongst those being trialled by Professor Nutt.

For me the only bad trip was BECAUSE of me being down/depressed at the time, but maybe we&#039;re talking different doses here? Looking back the bad trip was actually good, I definitely still got a lesson which helped with my issues at the time in the long run, but it was in no way like LSD just made me feel happy or at peace.

There has been a study that is investigating a positive causation between psilocybin (the ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms) and neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons and synaptic connections in the brain) http://www.psychonaut.com/psychonautic-news/28865-psilocybin-neurogenesis.html. I would think that since LSD and psilocybin are similar in terms of chemistry, that all psychedelics would induce this state of neurogenesis as well.<br /><br />Many users say that on high dosages of smoking grass or typical psychedelics that a natural brain-filter is bypassed, which is why users report a feeling of enhanced creativity, sensitization to music, enlightened feelings of inner awareness, connectedness with Nature and the Universe, and at higher dosages, synaesthesia (when the senses blend). In addition, there are anecdotal quotes from influential figures extolling and preaching on the benefits of psychedelics. Examples include Steve Jobs, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, Tim Leary, Richard Feynmann, Kary Mullis, Francis Crick, Ken Kesey, Aldous Huxley, Jim Morrison, Andrew Weil, Ralph Abraham, Alex Shulgin, Alex Grey, and John Lilly, to name just a few (I could go on all night). And let&#039;s not forget every rock band that ever existed.

The funny thing is that after my last acid trip, my friend told me I should shroom up before seeing Lucy again. Though he suggested 5-7 grams normal cubensis or 2.5-3.5 for... erm... what was the type... don&#039;t remember right now. Anyway, 6-8 grams of normal has always been my standard. I&#039;ll be shrooming when I can afford to for sure, then I&#039;ll be seeing Lucy and Dimitri, but for now I have my lovely cannabis.

As senior LSD researcher Dr. David Nichols, Distinguished Chair of Pharmacology at Purdue University and head of one of the world&#039;s top LSD research labs, stated in his 2004 review article on hallucinogens, &quot;There is no evidence that any of the hallucinogens, even the very powerful semisynthetic LSD, causes damage to any human body organ. [...] Hallucinogens do not cause life-threatening changes in cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic function because they have little or no affinity for the biological receptors and targets that mediate vital vegetative functions.&quot;1 Deaths resulting from the pharmacological effects of LSD are rare to non-existent.<br /><br />However, like all psychoactive drugs, LSD can induce cognitive and emotional alterations that can greatly affect behavior. With psychedelics such as LSD, there can be powerful and unexpected changes in thinking and perception. While under the influence of these drugs, an individual can exhibit poor judgement and delusional behavior, leading to accidents or dangerous situations. In those individuals predisposed toward certain psychiatric conditions, hallucinogens may precipitate psychotic responses or depression. In some individuals, long-lasting anxiety and/or depression may result from the unpleasant experiences and frightening visions that occurred during the psychedelic experience.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is quoted from the &quot;Health&quot; tab under the LSD vault on erowid.org. I hope that helps some. There are specific vaults for each psychedelic drug on this site, and with each, there is a health tab that will provide more information on each specific drug.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wonder if the same applies do MXE and/or K.<br /><br />Can MXE cause damage to the brain, other the alleged Onley&#039;s lesions?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Olney&#039;s lesions, also known as NMDA receptor antagonist (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) neurotoxicity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) (NAN), are a potential form of brain damage (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage). <br /><br />They are named after John Olney (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Olney), who conducted a study (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olney%27s_lesions#) in 1989 to investigate neurotoxicity caused by PCP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) and related drugs.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				psychedelics can definitely be hard on the brain if you are unprepared... do as much research as possible before jumping in the water. they can be very powerful tools for expanding the mind, but they must be used with deep respect. i would not be healing without them.

				Psychedelics have been used in research for plenty of years in improving people with depression other mental illnesses.&nbsp; I&#039;m not gonna post links mostly out of laziness but there is some documentary about how scientists and other sorts of people would take it so they could focus on certain problems and try and wrap their head around tough issues.&nbsp; Before the hippies got it, people thought of it as an amazing drug to improve the mind.&nbsp; Now the government won&#039;t touch it with a ten foot pole, no matter what research shows.

Both lower the uptake of seritoen in the brain, mushrooms simply provide extra seritoen. Continued low dosing appear to build up in the body and make a person who is depressive feel better/normal.<br /><br /><br />
