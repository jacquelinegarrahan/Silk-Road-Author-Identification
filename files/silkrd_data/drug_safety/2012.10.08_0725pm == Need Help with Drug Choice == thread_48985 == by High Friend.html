I respect you for doing that. <br /><br />if I were you I&#039;d look up 2 drugs on erowid - Adderal (4 amphetamine salts) and Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine 1 pure amphetamine salt)<br /><br />I have been prescribed both, tried both for a long time, stayed up several days on each, worked in huge social environements on each, etc.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a few advices:<br /><br />-Before buying, ask to see a picture if you can&#039;t see one. A lot of people here call their brand name &quot;Generic&quot;. If there&#039;s a b/B/barr/BARR on it, stay away unless it&#039;s dirt cheap. <br /><br />Generic is the drug produced by a company that spent over 30,000 hours (for dexedrine as an example) to figure out the perfect recipe and release form. <br />Brand name is the name of the company that took that same formula and whipped it together without adequate testing. Most times brand name will give you a &quot;dirty&quot; high. BARR is the worst brand name when it comes to the amphetamine world. <br /><br />-For the duration you&#039;re looking for, try to find an XR version of the drug. Some people call it ER, but the medical field has it labeled as XR. IR is the instant release and you will peak and come down much faster.<br /><br />-Amphetamines will make you more alert and more chatty. That social aspect you&#039;re looking for comes with every amphetamine (to my knowledge).<br /><br />-Amphetamines affect the &quot;reward&quot; part of your brain. As long as you don&#039;t sit in your room sulking about your lowly life, any kind of achievement ( Understanding a therory, etc) will give you the feeling of euphoria.<br /><br />-Visuals are not a huge part of amphetamines, unless you get a blood rush, are really dehydrated (Drink LOTS of water on those by the way.) or have been up for several days, you won&#039;t be seeing much. However, your senses are heightened as you focus on everything you see, hear, taste or feel. Not sure if that counts as a visual.<br /><br /><br /><br />TLDR;<br /><br />I&#039;d personally go with Dexedrine XR Generic.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be selling some as soon as I get around to setting up my vendor&#039;s account and as soon as I get a quote from anyone that knows their stuff about amphetamines or get a decent offer, seeing as the generic ones are damn hard to come by in Canada.

				I agree, with that list of requirements RX amphetamines would be the way to go, although I would say its mild euphoria, not moderate to high euphoria. With moderate to high euphoria you are generally gonna find a drug that is either highly addictive or really bad for you/your brain, or a little of both. Or, Acid which would be disqualified on several of those other requirements.

				Kratom would be something to look into. It is an herbal pseudo-opioid so the potential for addiction is still there, but that actual risk is much lower than any prescription or street opiate.

				Thanks for everyone&#039;s input. I should have mentioned that I&#039;ve tried amphetamines and they make me too jittery and don&#039;t have enough euphoria. I&#039;ve tried opoids and they make me too drowsy. I think I&#039;m going to experiment with various dosages of MDMA and see if that gets me where I want to go.

There is no perfect drug for everyone, I think the closest thing to it when it comes to pros vs. cons is weed, but for your criteria I would say amphetamines or oxycodone. Oxy provides a lot of energy for most people, maybe give it another try but be careful.

As euphoria goes up, concentration usually goes down. As others have suggested, Adderall/amphetamine may be a good choice, but if you&#039;re looking for even more euphoria, perhaps methamphetamine. As an infrequent user, I haven&#039;t found meth addictive, but I can&#039;t speak for others. Be smart, know yourself, and above all, be careful.

				oxy is highly addictive, i wouldnt recommend it<br /><br />also imo you have two sets of contradictory goals<br /><br />anything that causes strong euphoria will likely have a decent potential for addiction <br /><br />also, anything that causes visuals will likely make focusing on linear tasks more difficult and potentially hinder social interaction <br /><br />personally i think you should look into the phenethylamine class, very low doses of a mild psychedelic like 2c-i for me would meet nearly all your goals

				Try any of these before you sink cash into it:<br /><br />2c-i (15-20mg)<br />2c-b (15-20mg)<br />MDMA (100-150mg, 180mg if that&#039;s still not enough to get a desired roll)<br /><br />All of the above can get most of the desired effects.<br /><br />MDMA I&#039;d be a bit careful with since it tends to have a heavier crash on some people, but IMHO is the holy grail of party drugs and should be treated with a lot of respect (i.e. space your rolls out at least a month apart, keeps the magic, &quot;magical&quot;), binging for a weekend or a festival here or there won&#039;t kill ya, but some of my most epic party nights have been with good old M.&nbsp; Also the intensity of rolling varies from person to person.&nbsp; I find I can concentrate well on it if I really try, but I also tend to have a lot of fun letting the drug distract the fuck out of me and take me all over the place.
