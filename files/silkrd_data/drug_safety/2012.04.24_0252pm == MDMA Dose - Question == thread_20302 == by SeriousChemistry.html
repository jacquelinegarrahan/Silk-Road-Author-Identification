				Hey guys!<br /><br />I have here 1g of 80+% MDMA crystals. It&#039;s my first time, so just a question:<br /><br />Formula [weight in kg]*[1,5mg MDMA]=130 mg<br /><br />But does that mean, that I have to take 130 mg of the 80% MDMA or 130+20% to have 130mg 100% MDMA?<br /><br />I hope my question is clear enough xD<br /><br />Thanks for help!

				I would go with the 130MG and see how you feel in 60-90 minutes. Also, remember to x2-3 your dose if you&#039;re on SSRI anti-depressants.

				i think up to 250mg would be fine for a first time, but not at once. <br />i reckon if you split into 3 piles of 125mg, 62.5mg and 62.5mg.<br />Wrap each pile up in some cig papers, or dispense into gel caps if you have them.<br />take the 125mg cap then see how you feel after 2 hours, if you feel good and want to take it further take one of the other caps, and after another hour (maybe 2) take the other.<br /><br />Above all i wouldn&#039;t worry, on a standard night if i was taking MDMA i would allow myself 500mg. Even when i once went a bit silly and took about 1.2g i was fine and still had a great night. Comedown however was a bitch, started dropping at 10pm and couldn&#039;t stop dancing/moving til 4pm the next day.<br /><br />Stay hydrated but don&#039;t go drinking liter after liter of water.<br /><br />Most of all, Have Fun!

				I did 100 mg my first dose, it&#039;s up to you dude. At 100 and above you WILL feel it. If it&#039;s your first time, anything between 100-130 mg will do you fine. If you want to have a religious experience do 200 mg for your first time, but again not recommended unless you REALLY want it.

				I say maybe do 150mg and then drop another 50mg at the peak for a good night. Drink water but not too much, overhydration is dangerous too.

				I agree with jollymolly 150mg to start and then a booster of 50mg, you could bump up the initial dose to 200 mg if you wanted to but don&#039;t go any higher than that. Either way you are going to have a great time! Haha what I wouldn&#039;t give to re-experience my first roll again. Spread the love dude 8)

				150mg is a great dose.&nbsp; 200mg if you want to get absolutely floored. Heh, at 200mg you won&#039;t really want to move too much you&#039;ll feel so good.&nbsp; Your eyes might be wiggling and/or rolling to the back of your head.&nbsp; Otherwise I agree with 150mg dose with a 50mg booster!

				I would go 150mg the first time with no boosters.This will give the total experience which you can have only once. For later rolls you can experiment with smaller doses to see if you prefer that.

				Thank you all for your replies! You really helped me!<br /><br />I decided to take something between 130mg and 140mg. And I can tell you: It was FREAKING AWESOME! Omg, never had such a good night in the club before. I think I don&#039;t have to describe how awesome it was, you know it already! ;)<br /><br />Now taking a 5-6 week gap and then we&#039;ll roll again!<br /><br />Thank you so much! ;)
