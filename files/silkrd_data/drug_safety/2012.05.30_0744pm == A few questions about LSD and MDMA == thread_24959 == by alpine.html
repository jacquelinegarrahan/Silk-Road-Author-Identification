				Sorry if these are dumb question but I am a complete noob when it comes to LSD and MDMA. Really only smoked pot before. <br /><br />1. Is it ok to take my normal meds while on LSD or MDMA?<br />2. Is there anything I should not mix with these? Pot, alcohol,ect?

				LSD is remarkably safe, and MDMA is *relatively* safe in most contexts.&nbsp; Depending on what your regular medications are, you may want to cease taking them for a bit beforehand.&nbsp; There are less contraindications with LSD, but with MDMA, you should /definitely/ not take it if you are on any MAOI medications--it would put you at a higher risk for serotonin syndrome (no fun).&nbsp; Take at least a week off MAOIs before dosing MDMA.&nbsp; It would probably be wise to stop taking amphetamines (like Adderall) for at least a few days before MDMA, which is an amphetamine itself.&nbsp; I would also suggest avoiding SSRI medications for at least a few days before MDMA.&nbsp; There is little/no risk associated with this combination (as far as I have found), but it can heavily weaken the experience.<br /><br /><br />As far as what to &quot;mix&quot; with the experience, a lot of people (myself included) find cannabis to be nice with LSD, and a great complement to the come-down on MDMA (can kind of distract from the main MDMA experience, though).&nbsp; Keep in mind that smoking weed while on LSD (and most psychedelics) will generally make the experience more intense.&nbsp; If you are past the peak and are starting to come down, oftentimes smoking a bowl will jettison you back to the peak again.&nbsp; This can be good or bad, depending on what you want.<br /><br />I generally avoid mixing most other chemicals when rolling or tripping, simply because there&#039;s already enough going on for me.&nbsp; Alcohol can be satisfying after either experience, but I usually find I don&#039;t get much out of it--not much buzz, just a little relaxation.&nbsp; A benzo can be nice after a heavy roll, to help you relax and fall asleep.<br /><br />More &quot;intense&quot; combinations include taking MDMA and LSD at the same time (&quot;candyflipping&quot;) (or MDMA and mushrooms [&quot;hippyflipping&quot;], or many other variations of psychedelics and other chemicals).&nbsp; I recommend getting to know these chemicals individually before mixing and matching.&nbsp; They can create something very different than the sum of their parts.

				Don&#039;t drink beer when you&#039;re high on MDMA. It&#039;ll make you &#039;sober&#039; in a matter of minutes. <br />I have absolutely no clue how, or why, it works but my experience is that it just does. <br /><br />Drinking some beers beforehand tho seems to be fine, don&#039;t overdo it because else you will get a big black hole in your memory ;)
