				Ok I&#039;ve got exams coming up in 2 weeks and I haven&#039;t been attending many lectures or reading the required text books. I plan to stream the lectures, make notes and read the text books of all 4 units I&#039;ve chosen in the next 2 weeks. I study business so the units I have are pretty un-motivating. I have access high quality Meth and Speed. The meth is the cheaper option and I assume the stronger option. I intend to ingest the substance as capsules, not smoke, IV or snort.<br /><br />I have no tolerance to both drugs and I weigh about 170lbs, what would be a good dosage for a study session and how long will it last?<br /><br />I&#039;ll also note I have access to plenty Valium so comedowns are not an issue for me.<br /><br />Thanks

				If you&#039;ve never done meth then avoid it. Chances are you&#039;ll enjoy it too much and before you realize it, life is dull without it. <br />It is fantastic orally ime.<br /><br />If you have.actual high quality speed (not adderall), please consider vending here. You&#039;ll do well.

				Are you saying I&#039;d enjoy it too much I&#039;d stay away from studying or that I&#039;d get addicted?<br /><br />The speed is sold on here by an Australian vendor, but its about 170 a point. Basically I could get 2 points of Meth for the same price as 1 point of pure speed.

				Methylphenidate is good, I&#039;m on it right now.<br /><br />Though, you must actually want to study when you take it, and be already studying so when it kicks in you dont&#039; get side tracked.<br />Don&#039;t expect to take them and be like &#039;I want to study now!&#039; they&#039;ll amplify what you want to do.<br /><br />So #1 advice, start studying before you take them, then let it hit you as you&#039;re mid-way through.<br /><br />Adderall is also good, wank beforehand. <br /><br />Don&#039;t do meth, it&#039;s just not good for studying.<br /><br />Methylphenidate has some brain plasticity, so it&#039;s good for remembering things better.<br />Methylphenidate is Ritalin SR, Ritalin, concerta, focalin (IIRC).<br /><br />So basically yeah.<br />Also, if you use it each time you study, you become reliant on it.<br />I should be studying now, but I took methylphenidate now I&#039;m dancing around going &#039;FUCK YEAH FUCK YEAH FUCK YEAH&#039; waiting for a comedown that&#039;s gonna be shit.<br />Listening to one 20 second clip on replay for the 400th time (no joke).<br /><br />And yeah, fuck.<br />Speed, ampthetamine that is, is alright. Adderall is better because it&#039;s pure.<br /><br />

				I have studied on drugs for a number of years now, ive tried pretty much every amphetamine derivative ever made but unlike yourself i prefer the smoked route since it has a faster onset. I did use 5mg dexamphetamines for a bit (swollowed) but got frustrated at it&#039;s irregular onset due to erratic absorption. <br /><br />I found crystal meth useful, if i had too much it&#039;ll make me too mellow to study (as with all others with a methyl on the nitrogen). This is due to it&#039;s serotonin action.<br />So, for a study aid, you&#039;d want a drug with least serotonin action (not hallucinogenic and not empathetigenic) <br />The one with the least serotonin action is 2-FA (2-Fluoroamphetamine) and i have found that to be by far the best study aid (nootropic) i have taken (smoked that is)

				Would try and get some modafinil if I were you. You can buy it on the clearweb, &quot;pharmacy geoff&quot; springs to mind. Really helped me through a set of exams.

				I second the modafinil. It&#039;s fairly cheap, and no chance of getting addicted. The main drawback is that it really isn&#039;t all that fun, so if you planned to use it solely for studying, it should work well, but don&#039;t expect it to be all that recreational.

Definitely modafinil. Look it up on google.

				I&#039;m prescribed Vyvanse and its awesome. Basically extended release dextroamphetamine, but its just as effective as adderall with less pronounced side effect/comedown (there really is no come down with Vyvanse, it just very gradually wears off). That is available on here, so I would strongly reccomend Vyvanse. And yes, he did mean you will get addicted to Meth. Stay away from that shit.

				Yup, meth is too enjoyable. It wouldnt be so bad if it permitted sleep. To uses it non-recreationally takes more discipline and willpower than most people have. It is however a ADHD med in the US. IIRC, it has been shown to be better tolerated and more effective than dextro amphetamine in children, but the.stigma has made it less commonly prescribed. <br /><br />Speed, dex amp (incl vyvanse) or mixed amp salts (adderall) are much better better options than non-prescription meth.<br /><br />Ive only tried SR street speed and it was garbage compared to Rx amphetamine. <br />&nbsp;<br />Of all these, Rx amps are my preferred choice. <br /><br />And do have a wank prior to taking (hillariously true btw), and do begin studies before you ingest as others have said. Very important.<br /><br />Also disable your internet connection and computer, and delete/throw away any and all porn, turn off your phone, and stay far away.from any potential sex partners :)

				You might want to consider Amphetamine Sulphate (speed). I&#039;ve been a stimulant user on and off for over half of my life and I usually wouldn&#039;t recommend speed. But currently there&#039;s 3 vendors who claim to have pure speed, i.e. unadulterated Amphetamine Sulphate. I&#039;ll try all of them, the first one today and by now it&#039;s pretty awesome. Most of the nervous/shaky feelings from speed is not the Amphetamine, but the adulterants. Take them out and you have a very clean experience. I&#039;d wait til all 3 vendors are reviewed, but this could be a decent alternative that safes a bunch of money.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36934.msg419767#msg419767">Quote from: blowdrobro on August 20, 2012, 01:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have us pharma grade Nuvigil brand-name (armodafinil) it&#039;s probably the best study aid out there. 250mg for 10$ PM me if you&#039;re interested.

It&#039;s the best method of ingestion IMO and lasts longest. I strongly recommend doing this:<br /><br />1. Crush up your crystal shard into powder.<br />2. Weigh out your 25 mg dose and add to a capsule.<br />3. Fill the remainder of each capsule with a white baking flour .<br />4. Done. This should minimize (but not eliminate) any abuse/addiction potential because now the only ROA you have is to swallow it.<br /><br />Bring one capsule to the library and leave the remainder of the stash at home. Best to take it early it the morning because it will keep you up 12-18 hours.<br /><br />If you are totally new to both amphetamine and/or methamphetamine, it&#039;s likely that will get good results from 10-15 mg. <br /><br />If sleep is still a problem at the end of the day: GHB&gt;benzos&gt;beer + weed. GHB is a fucking miracle drug for sleeping post-stimulant use but you have to be responsible with it and know what you are doing.<br /><br />V8 juice and V8 Splash (= tomatoe/vegetable juice drinks in the US) posses magical restorative properties and are fantastic to drink if you begin to feel strung out, drained, or crash.<br />

Baking soda can be used to mess with the metabolizing of some stimulants (possibly make them last longer), depending on what pH-value of stomach/urine is optimal for quick excretion. But I think in this specific case, given the low amount, it&#039;s used as an antacid, to help keep your stomach calm. <br /><br />Two weeks of daily intake of crystal meth will fuck up your stomach for sure. Srsly dude, this is a bad idea for so many reasons. Why do you think all those ADHD guys get d-amp or MPH? But still, good luck to you. You&#039;ll need it.

				Oxiracetam+Piracetam+Choline if u like Noops. Possibly even Ginkgo Biloba, I used to use it for studying but be careful because its a mild maoi and i got serotonin syndrome from it back in the day when i binged on bk-MDMA&nbsp; :(

				I second Vyvance. imo, it&#039;s a more effective stim. if you&#039;re studying. <br /><br />Like soccerpros mentioned, nootropics are getting a lot of attention for their cognitive&nbsp; effects and super low toxicity. I haven&#039;t had much success with them but they&#039;re definitely worth taking a look at.

Baking soda can be used to mess with the metabolizing of some stimulants (possibly make them last longer), depending on what pH-value of stomach/urine is optimal for quick excretion. But I think in this specific case, given the low amount, it&#039;s used as an antacid, to help keep your stomach calm. <br /><br />Two weeks of daily intake of crystal meth will fuck up your stomach for sure. Srsly dude, this is a bad idea for so many reasons. Why do you think all those ADHD guys get d-amp or MPH? But still, good luck to you. You&#039;ll need it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I meant wheat flour, but you are absolutely correct about baking soda. That would work too.<br />The reason I said wheat flour is for the reasons john_snow_da_bastard stated. The idea of snorting flour up your nose (should he be tempted to do so) would not only be a disaster but it would likely impede absorbtion as well. You&#039;d end up with yeast bugers in your nose.<br /><br />Baking soda won&#039;t clog his nose up the same way, but interestingly, it does seem to reduce absorbtion in the nasal passages (IME). But orally, it would act as an antacid as you describe.<br /><br />So both would work.<br /><br />And to OP, I agree with Muslix about it being the least wisest choice. I understand your dilemma (I made the same choice earlier this year for the exact same reasons as yourself). Personally, I find a desire for use to be equal to that of which I once had for Rx amphetamine, and when I do use it I tend to use about the same amount as I did with dexamp. I&#039;ve never used it for more than a few consecutive days in a row and have always taken 1-4 weeks off. I&#039;ll be the first to admit that I&#039;ve struggled to use it as I originally intended (but I also had the same problem with adderall).<br />&nbsp;Just be careful and make sure you are aware that the risks of things getting out of hand are very real. I strongly recommend doing the flour/baking soda thing and sticking to your planned regimin of a couple times per week, oral only.

				My bitcoin client has become corrupted so I won&#039;t be able to order anything this week. I&#039;ve had to get some street meth, the guy showed me the product and it looked like nice clear crystals but I know fuck all about meth purity so I dunno how good it will be. It&#039;s gonna be the same price as on here though. I&#039;ve snorted Oxy before and never ordered or been tempted to try it again so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll become addicted at all. I&#039;m just not that into stims or opiates, I like my benzos and MDMA, that&#039;s the only addictions I&#039;ve struggled with.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered 2 points since I have a feeling this stuff will be weak. I will use the baking soda as advised. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll have my hands on it til tonight so I&#039;ll head into uni early tomorrow, get my head into the books and try 25mg. I also eat very healthy and have plenty of benzos so do not worry, I will be looking after myself.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a variety of pills and caps and I&#039;m pretty sure a few of them have been meth or speed bombs. I also have mates that have ingested Meth before and never become addicted, I even have a friend who smoked meth nearly every weekend but when holidays were over he stopped completely and hasn&#039;t touched the stuff in over a year.<br /><br />Obviously next time I&#039;ll be going the pharmaceutical route but this time I just don&#039;t have the time to wait for an international delivery when exams are a week away.

				I suggest you study on little more than a small amount of caffeine. (And nootropics if you use them). <br /><br />Set yourself study goals, then reward yourself with drugs later and actually enjoy them when you clock off.
