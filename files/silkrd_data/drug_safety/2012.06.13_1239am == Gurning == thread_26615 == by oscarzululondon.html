				A few weeks ago I took some really good MDMA, had a great night but gurned like crazy.<br /><br />Now a few weeks later, I haven&#039;t taken any MDMA or gurning drugs at all, however every time I drink alcohol I find myself gurning.<br /><br />Does anyone know what could be up? Am I just noticing this as I&#039;ve started to become aware of gurning from my experiences with MDMA, or is it some kind of psychological hang-over?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :)<br /><br />OZ

				What they said, just take it easy and let it work it&#039;s way out of your system before jumping back on the saddle.<br /><br />If it worries you any, you should take some magnesium in the meantime and see if it prevents any gurning when you go out drinking and don&#039;t want people to notice if the gurning is pronounced.

				I also am very prone to gurning on drone and mdma. Never alcohol though? <br />I&#039;ve tried taking a shit load of magnesium, although it helped, i still gurned a lot. I try chewing gum but that usually just turns to a pulp after 20mins and gets stuck to my teeth, so that&#039;s useless as well. The best antidote for me is talking my ass off and drinking water. (water because it lubes up the mouth.. pause ;) )&nbsp; If anyone has a &#039;cure&#039; for gurning, then please let us know? My friends are shocked when they look at my mouth after a night of &#039;gurning drugs&#039; just because i&#039;m so unfortunately prone to it :( . I fear my gums and tongue will suffer irreversible damage at some point, even though i rarely do these drugs, about once a month tbh. But still, it hurts for about 10 days after, just cos i&#039;ve fucked up my mouth so much. <br /><br />and i beg no-one is going to comment and say &quot;don&#039;t take such a high dose&quot;, nah fuck you bruv that&#039;s boring.&nbsp; ;D
