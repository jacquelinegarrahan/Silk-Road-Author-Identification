				Hey there SR! Curious to knowing what are the mental damages of K if any? My other concern is that i have done about 3grams of ketamine in my life time, should i be concerned? I first tried it to see if it helps with depression. Now its got me thinking what are the dark sides of this. any one have the scoop on any of this?

				Don&#039;t worry about it. The people who are obviously suffering from mental issues from this drug go through grams a day.

				My friend is went through the same thing (long story.) Basically with k its not the short term side effects you should be worried about its the &quot;Ill just do it one more time factor.&quot; My advice would be to stop taking k altogether and never touch the stuff again. But its your high and therefor up to you, just bear in mind that recreational k use can escalate.

I can see how it is very habit forming. I finished a gram of k in a week and a half. I dont really do k much but i got some really good stuff so i have just been trying it lately, which lead to me wanting to do more. I dont see how you can get addicted to this unless a big group of your friends does it and you get peer pressured or more like just being around it so much you are more likely to try some here and there anyways. At least in my case that is how it is, I need to do more research on any mental effects.&nbsp; I doubt i will be getting more as its gone

				The only time i do K is to k hole, so usually 300-500mg in two lines one after another, headphones and lay in a dark, trip out with closed and open visual shit. Is this more dangerous than having little amounts over a day time?

				I&#039;m thinking about trying some K but I&#039;m a little confused as to what it is. Is it a psychedelic or not?

				The biggest concern heath wise of Ketamine is Kidney damage.<br />Me being one of the biggest Dissociative heads on the Road is having to deal with kidney stones that is caused maybe half the time by Dissociatives and the other times refined sugars and such.<br /><br />It&#039;s quite easy to to realize it damages your kidneys because after a night dreaming with kitty you can feel it in your kidneys. You don&#039;t have to take my word for it, it is well documented in medical journals.<br /><br />MXE is was suppose to me an improvement on on the kidney damage issue because the guy that developed MXE for Phantom Limb Syndrome needed an alternative to Ketamine and it&#039;s damaging effects.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad

Buy a gram. Experiment. Start off with low doses and work your way up. I wouldn&#039;t recommend that anyone use K in a rave setting without first experiencing the K hole in a more comfortable setting. I couldn&#039;t imagine being launched into that warped reality in a very public place with no prior heavy psychedelic experiences. That is one thing I&#039;ve noticed about the rave scene, people take MDMA and think they can handle psychedelics and that they will be similar, and end up having their mind blown to pieces. Sometimes good sometimes bad. I dosed a kid on NYE with some very potent liquid that I thought he knew what he was getting himself into. I later found him screaming nonsense outside the venue, then curled up in the back of our party bus vomiting and crying and had lost his shoes and jacket. I felt bad but hey he asked me for it. I think K is similar, people with no experience take small doses and enjoy it at a rave, so they take higher doses expecting the same and end up wandering around lost with that scared puppy dog look in their eyes. <br /><br />Smaller doses will give you waves of euphoria, light visuals, appreciation of music, feels amazing to move around. This is why it is fun in rave settings. Higher doses are more like DMT jaw dropping holy fuck I think I&#039;ve died and moved on to the next realm type of shit. And as you can imagine their is a whole spectrum of different experiences in between the two extremes. <br /><br />Very interesting chemical, I&#039;m fairly new to it myself. Hopefully this experimentation will not lead me down a road that will leave me bed ridden and pissing blood like nomad.&nbsp; :P

				I would personally never take Ket on a rave, anything that will lower my reaction time to that point is stupid to take at raves. Usually you have to have your eyes open, and pretty much be alert if we are talking about squat raves, we all know there is the good and the bad people attending these. Saw loads of fights, and was involved in many, local scum takes an advantage and looks for people who are less likely to fight back. I also saw people k-holing at raves, on the floor tripping. Usually people just take small amounts not sure why because I never tried it like that. <br />MXE gave me the worst trip of my life which lasted about 20 hours, I will never take it again, I did a whole gram of it&nbsp; thinking it was just cut ketamine, the person who gave me the ket was trusted, and he was actually tricked by a new guy he was buying from, got a full refund but the depressing state I was in that night/day was just unforgettable.
