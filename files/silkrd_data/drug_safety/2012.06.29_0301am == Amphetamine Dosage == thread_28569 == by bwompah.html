				I noticed there&#039;s some inexpensive amphetamine powder available in the U.S. now. The vendor is reputable and claims it&#039;s ~70% pure. I&#039;m wondering about how many doses you might get out of a gram--anybody know? I currently have no tolerance to stimulants, so I can&#039;t imagine it&#039;d take a huge amount, but I&#039;m not sure. Help me, SR, you&#039;re my only hope.

				20mg of amphetamine is plenty for a new user.&nbsp; I highly suggest you read up on amphetamine suppliers.&nbsp; If you are referring to juergen, his product is so bad I would honestly call it a scam.&nbsp; He has consistently lied about quality as well as where he was getting it from.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I highly doubt it is 70% pure.&nbsp; I would pay well over $100/gram for stuff that good.&nbsp; Pretty much every speed vendor on SR has lied about it&#039;s purity when they give a percentage.&nbsp; Check out the thread in rumor mills regarding amphetamine vendors and make your decision based on what people are saying there.

				Someone on the Rumor Mill sticky just ordered from the vendor you are referring too. Said he will post up his test review soon -- I think UGS&#039;s shipping turn around has been about 2-4 days domestic so it shouldn&#039;t be too long. <br /><br />The only bad thing is last time I checked he went from 50 grams two days ago to now 15. <br />

				I&#039;m expecting mine tomorrow (from UGS). I&#039;ll have a review up by tomorrow evening.<br /><br />I agree that 20 mg should be plenty for a pure amphetamine (like adderall) for a new user. Even as an experienced user of amphetamines, 20 mg jazzes me up nicely if I&#039;ve been sleeping &amp; eating.<br /><br />FWIW, I believe the 70%+ may be akin to the MDMA 83%+ thing. That0 is, a molecule of amphetamine sulfate salt has a molecular mass of ~185 [~135 amp + ~50 sulphate]. The amphetamine part accounts for &gt;70% of the salt molecule.<br />That&#039;s why all speed and MDMA vendor write 70%+ and 80%+ (respectively), because those numbers (if accurate) leave little room for anything else (impurities). <br /><br />Obviously, this doesn&#039;t mean shit, as evidenced by all the garbage sold by european vendors with the same claims.<br /><br />UGS&#039;s stuff, to me, looks different (at least in the pictures) than the other crap on SR.<br />I&#039;ve never bought from him before but I&#039;ve been aware of him for a while now and he&#039;s a solid vendor (super nice too). I doubt he&#039;d sell garbage with a rep like his. And it&#039;s listed at a damn good price (but so are some of his other items).<br /><br />And 328502E, 100/gram, really? For me,&nbsp; that&#039;s just far far too high and from a practical standpoint, meth is a better choice at that point. <br />Neither substances should be that high imo. Personally I prefer speed but it quickly loses it&#039;s appeal when it approaches the price of pure d-meth.<br /><br />And legit speed is being sold for ~20/, it would be undeniable rape to charge that much. That&#039;s why I&#039;ll never buy adderall from here, no matter how much I want it. Also similar is the scenario of some of the outrageously expensive domestic MDMA vendors who&#039;ve had shit listed for weeks and not a single review or sale.<br />

				Thanks, everybody. I sincerely doubt this stuff is actually 70% pure, but I&#039;ll be satisfied with mediocre quality given the price. I&#039;ve always enjoyed the occasional coke and Adderall binges, but its been a while, so I&#039;m hoping this can satiate my craving to some extent. I just refuse to pay the exorbitant Adderall prices on here. Fuck. That. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had good experiences with UGS in the past. I don&#039;t think he would intentionally sell anything bunk, so my hopes are pretty high. Looking forward to seeing some reviews in the next few days.
