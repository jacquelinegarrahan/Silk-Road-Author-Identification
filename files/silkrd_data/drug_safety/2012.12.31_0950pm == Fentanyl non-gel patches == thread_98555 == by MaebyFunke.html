				I&#039;ve done the fentanyl gel patches before by putting some of the gel on tinfoil and smoking it. I have a 12mcg non-gel fentanyl patch and I&#039;m not sure what to do with it. Should I just wear it? I&#039;ve been doing about 50mg of roxicodone a day, so I have some tolerance right now. Since 12mcg is such a low amount, should I just wear it?

				Depending on your tolerance just wearing it might not work to get you the effects you might want.<br /><br />I have personally only smoked the gel patches (can you even do that anymore?), but I have read a lot and some users say they cut off a piece and chew on it and it gets absorbed through the mouth, like sublingually but obviously it&#039;s not directly under your tongue if you&#039;re chewing it so I don&#039;t know where exactly it would be absorbed unless you made sure your saliva pooled under your tongue..&nbsp; There was also something that involved Isopropyl alcohol in the mouth and that seemed like a horrible idea to me so I can&#039;t recall the exact method. But also make sure you don&#039;t swallow the patch because there are some bad ingredients.<br /><br />If you Google it you will be able to find forums with peoples experiences and practices, that&#039;s how I found out, but I can only remember the chewing. Blulight might have something, not sure if you go to other forums though but there is a ton of info on how to abuse almost anything just waiting on the interweb.<br /><br />Sorry if I wasn&#039;t much help, but search engines are!

				Chew it once every 10 minutes and hold it between your molars and your cheek. The buccal membrane is made for fent,.&nbsp; I did this with the Mylan patches that had no gel.&nbsp; They&#039;re not worth going through the effort of converting into a powder, I tried this and despite following some decent instructions the best I could, the product became like plastic and was useless.<br /><br />Chew it like a dip.

				Depending on your tolerance I&#039;d cut it up into a bunch of small pieces, maybe like 4x4 and chew one by one for 20-30 minutes, let it absorb through your mouth and re-dose as necessary.
