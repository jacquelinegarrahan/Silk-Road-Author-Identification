				I&#039;ve tried the following things and these are my negative experiences with them.<br /><br />Ritalin:<br /><br />Short lasting; heavy crash<br /><br />Adderall<br /><br />Medium lasting, ridiculous tolerance curve (from 20/mg to 80mg/day in one year)<br /><br />Meth (pill form)<br /><br />Long lasting; great high but even more neurotoxic, withdrawals kick in very fast (next day), minor short (20 sec) psychotic episodes after only two weeks of use.<br /><br /><br />Isn&#039;t there anything better with less negative side effects (don&#039;t say coffee). Something with good potency and slow tolerance buikd. I tried anything, from taking piracetam to increase the intensity to taking memantine to lowering tolerance, on the long term, everything fails.... I Need uppers for work, i&#039;m a store manager working about 60hrs/wk and I hate my job but my personal situation isn&#039;t secure enough to just quit and get another job. Any advice is welcome.

				How was your experience with Piracetam? I know you used it to potentiate amphetamines, but it works great on its own in high doses too. However; I didn&#039;t get many effects off of it until I started combining it with Alpha GPC.<br /><br />What worked WONDERS for me is something called Phenylpiracetam. I have no idea what the specifics behind it are, but I believe it was made by the russians as a stimulant (with a Piracetam structure). On some web pages it says its prescribed as a general stimulant or to increase tolerance to extreme temperature/stress.<br /><br />I ordered a few of these 100mg capsules, and took two of them one day before going to work. <br /><br />I was amazed by how much energy it gave me. Getting out of bed that morning I was sluggish and tired, within an hour of taking it I was completely energized and I didn&#039;t feel like I was being stimulated by any drug, I just felt really good and energetic. I also felt like my thoughts flowed a little better, and I was working non-stop for about 8 hours. No crash or anything at the end.<br /><br />I think I remember reading that it does build a tolerance over time (like most things). I don&#039;t think it builds up too fast though. Its definitely worth looking into, I still have about 15 capsules left of the stuff, and I save it for days when I need an extra boost at work.<br /><br />If you want something natural, anything with high doses of Vitamin B&#039;s will work pretty good as well.

				I think modafinil/armodafinil seem like they might be a worthwhile alternative.&nbsp; They&#039;re not recreational, it&#039;s more like you take them and don&#039;t feel sleepy for hours.&nbsp; None of the addictiveness too, although there is a some tolerance effects.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel twitchy like with caffeine either.
