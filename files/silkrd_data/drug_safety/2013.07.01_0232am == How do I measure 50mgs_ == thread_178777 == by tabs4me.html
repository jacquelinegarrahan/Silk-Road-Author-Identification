				1. Buy a milligram scale<br />2. Weigh out 50mg&#039;s<br />3. ? ? ? ?<br />4. Profit

				Hmm... Scale is best, but if you want serious alternatives...<br /><br />1. Do you know the qty you started with/have left?<br />2. Find something it is soluble in. It doesn&#039;t seem to be a water soluble compound, judging by its structure, but I could be wrong. It has a low solubility in isopropanol, but that doesn&#039;t rule out ethanol.<br />3. Take your stash, dissolve in a measured amount of liquid. Now you can estimate you mg/mL solution to take the desired dose.<br /><br />For example: 1 g of MXE in 1000 mL everclear = 1mg/mL. 50 mg = 50 mL.<br /><br />If it isn&#039;t soluble in ethanol, water, or oils, then you might be forced to get a high quality scale.<br />

Take a tiny, tiny, tiny bump, wait 10 mins, and continue from there.

				HAH! I can understand, being high in front of your family is veeery awkward.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you should avoid it.<br /><br />Get a decent scale that measures mgs.&nbsp; There&#039;s pocket scales that are used to measure precious stones, they also measure mgs very precisely.<br /><br />DO NOT skimp on the price.&nbsp; If you buy it from the right place it&#039;ll be worth every penny.&nbsp; A scale worth about 80£ is the minimal investment.<br />You can find one for about 20£ that will accurately measure mgs for a few months but that&#039;s as long as they will last for.&nbsp; They will start making mistakes and you won&#039;t always realize it without comparing.&nbsp; Kitchen scales can be purchased for 20£ they&#039;re not made to measure milligrams.&nbsp; For the same price you get the same quality as a kitchen scale or worse, that&#039;s why they&#039;ll just cock up and screw you over.<br /><br />Get one with a weight so that you can re-calibrate it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry about the price, share it amongst a friend or two that would have a need for one.<br />If you think you don&#039;t need it after a few months you&#039;ll be able to sell it off and get some of your money back.<br /><br />The brand I have is Kern, I&#039;ve had it for over a year I re-calibrate it every month or so.&nbsp; It&#039;s even got a guarantee.<br /><br />Do this and you&#039;ll never pass out in front of your family again&nbsp; ;D

				Excellent advice above. <br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck around eyeballing chemicals that are potent in very small doses.<br /><br />Buy an mg scale
