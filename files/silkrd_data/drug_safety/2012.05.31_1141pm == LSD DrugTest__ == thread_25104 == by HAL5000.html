				Simple answer: 24-72 hours<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_testing.shtml<br /><br />You can almost guarantee that LSD won&#039;t be tested for in 99% of drug tests, unless they are specifically looking for LSD in particular.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem like anything else would give a false positive either, except for maybe morning glory seeds(just a guess)

				As far as I&#039;m aware, usually less than a week, but possibly up to 2 weeks.. Guess it also depends how often you do it. And also standard drugs tests won&#039;t test for LSD, from what I&#039;ve read countless times in the past; a simple google search will probably confirm that.

				Also, most, if not all, LSD tests have to be done using spinal fluid, and I can&#039;t remember that ever being done in the past 20 years - too invasive a test with the risk of spinal cord damage. Few doctors would be willing to do the test.

No.<br />Reference, please.<br /><br />NMS, home of the esoteric lab, offers LSD/trace screening of blood/serum/plasma, urine, tissue,&nbsp; and they do offer additional generic &#039;fluid&#039; screening, but CSF testing is not standard. <br />I agree that a lumbar puncture would be really over-the-top invasive, though, for a live human being.<br /><br />OP: there are urine immunoassay screens done for LSD/metabolites. They are extremely rare. It does require send-out for LC/MS confirmation when there is a positive.&nbsp; As far as a urine LSD screen, per Mayo Lab, &quot;The clearance half-life of LSD averages 3 to 4 hours. It takes 5 to 7 half-lives to clear 98% of a drug dose. Therefore, the presence of LSD greater than the lower limit of quantification (LOQ; cutoff concentration) indicates exposure to LSD within 1 day.<br />&nbsp;LSD is metabolized to 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD, which is present at concentrations 16 to 43 times higher than LSD, and is likely to be present in urine for up to 4 days after last exposure.<br />Cutoff concentrations:&nbsp; <br />IMMUNOASSAY SCREEN<br />&lt;0.5 ng/mL<br />LSD BY LC-MS/MS<br />&lt;0.5 ng/mL<br />2-OXO-3-HYDROXY-LSD BY LC-MS/MS<br />&lt;5.0 ng/mL<br />Interpretation <br />Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) exposure is confirmed if LSD is present &gt;0.5 ng/mL or if 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD is present &gt;5.0 ng/mL.<br />Cautions <br />The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) test is not subject to any known interference.<br />Positive immunoassay screening results should be considered presumptive due to documented cross-reactivities with the lysergic acid diethylamide reagent antibody.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />There has been a major surge of interest in hair testing, however, and LSD use can be detected in hair samples. Hair testing has been discussed on this forum in the past.<br />That&#039;s a longer detection period. There are not standards yet for whether or not LSD is run on hair, as far as I know.<br /><br />Right now, it&#039;s one of those &quot;only if they&#039;re looking for it&quot; tests, and needs to be added on special. It&#039;s not part of the SAMHSA panel and it&#039;s not something that is screened routinely in almost any health care setting.<br /><br />hope that helps.<br /><br />
