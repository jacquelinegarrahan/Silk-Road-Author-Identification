				I&#039;ve used plenty of softer substances in the past- pot, good ol&#039; alcohol (blegh), acid, benzos on prescription, Ecstasy and whatnotâ€“ but the big no-nos for me have always been Coke, Meth, bizarre designer chemicals like bath salts, prescription opiates and heroin.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m curious- what&#039;s the fun in heroin? Before you need it to satisfy an addiction, that is. Is it relaxation, floatiness- what is the &#039;high&#039; per-say?<br /><br />Also, if you simply wanted to try heroin but not fall into an addiction- is this possible? Let&#039;s say you purchase a small amount off SR, then restrict yourself from purchasing any more online or local. How hard will the withdrawal symptoms hit, and how long will you have to wait until they disappear?<br /><br />Thanks!

				no it&#039;s satisfying a psychological addiction and if you have physical addiction especially that. psychological addiction - craving for it and not doing for some time then doing it and getting warm and comfortable nothing special at first or if you have physical curing yourself getting from feeling like shit to getting very comfortable , warm ... It&#039;s just satisfying yourself by doing it when your brain gets used to it. At first you might not even notice it&#039;s effects.

				I have found that enjoying a &quot;lazy&quot; from time to time (months+ apart) is no issue and very relaxing. You pretty much roll your rolling paper up into a tube, draw the liquid into the paper, let it dry, and then introduce miss jane. This brings on a very LAZY buzz... you will be stuck so put on a nice movie or 3. I have never used IV for this and wouldn&#039;t. The shit grabs you full force if you aren&#039;t careful.

				I&#039;ve used it six times just to fight to effects and I&#039;m never going to use it again just to prove a point about junkies. It&#039;s very addictive stuff, I still end up thinking about using it again when I&#039;m sad. The effects will be burned into your memory for life.

				So... no real positives then? From what I gather it&#039;s just a lazy relaxation that you&#039;ll only want to do again to satisfy cravings?<br /><br />Any other opinions? The likelihood is that I may not try it as I&#039;ve been addicted to substances as simple as caffeine; but I&#039;m curious if there is any &#039;fun&#039; to it.

				I haven&#039;t done it but I want to tell you DONT do it.<br />It is not worth the risk. I prefer to fantasize about it, once youve gone there, especially Heroin, that&#039;s it then, its got to be the ultimate feeling.<br />If i did it, id be in the gutter and end up dead I reckon because id love it sooo much.<br /><br />IM some ketamine, it&#039;s apparently a lot like the floaty rush of herion..&nbsp; i do it a lot and its blissful but that does get psychologically addictive. Not as bad as heroin tho.<br /><br />IM K is so fun floaty and peaceful if you do a little starting off :)

				The first time is so great that users chase that feeling for the rest of their effed up lives, but it can never be repeated fully.<br />Psychological addiction sets in fairly quick (days) whereas physical dependance takes a while (a few weeks)<br />Smoke it, snort it or chase the dragon, but only once, not twice.<br />Be careful not to overdose, so read up and best ask the vendor on what you should take as that ONE dose of your life.<br />Remember an experience, don&#039;t create yourself a problem.<br />All this applies only to a responsible drug user.

I&#039;m one of those people &quot;who can do it recreationally&quot; and with needle mind you I can do cocaine/heroin in one needle recreationally too but so what I&#039;m not really happy I have constant cravings and they never seem to go away so the moral or friendly advice is stay the fuck away for your own well being - mental - if you can handle it - or if you can&#039;t you will destroy your life. It&#039;s a gambe you just don&#039;t know how your brain will react to it. Sometimes - most of the times - hell all the time&nbsp; I DON&#039;T HAVE THESE DRUGS I wish I never tried them at all and should have done only non addictive ones. But everyone decides for themselves I&#039;m not regretting my decision but I&#039;m not happy about it either these fucking cravings feels like they&#039;re burned into my brain.

Then when your body gets used to it then you&#039;ll know all about it ( it starts to get used to after 3 days - that means physical addiction starts to build up). Feeling is really great when you wake up in a morning before a hard days work and start to feel sick and you know you HAVE a fix that will give you great warm rush, great energy, great mood its just amazing.<br /><br />P.S. Deeper into addiction rushes get more enjoyable and more intense.<br /><br />P.S.S. If you want something like BANG for the first time buy cocaine and try injecting it.

I do find caffeine incredibly relaxing so perhaps they might relax me as well.<br /><br />The mere fact that I&#039;m anxiety prone is dissuading me from Opioids because if they can effectively reduce my anxiety I fear addiction. I did overcome a psychological and physical caffeine addiction- but that&#039;s fucking caffeine, not heroin.

				I&#039;ve experienced practically every single drug out there and heroin gives me the greatest euphoria over any other drug. Heroin itself is nontoxic so it does very little (if any at all according to many research reports) damage to your body compared to other drugs. The dangers of heroin use stem from overdosing (although in all my years of using I have never overdosed and neither have any of my friends) and using dirty syringes or unsafe injection procedures (easily prevented...you can buy packs of syringes for $2 at Walmart or visit your local needle exchange).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using heroin for 10+ years off and on (2 years snorting and the rest as an IV user) and I live near by the &quot;Heroin Capital of the U.S.&quot; so it&#039;s very cheap (a $10 bag can have even an opiate tolerant user catching a great buzz here), very good, and all over the place. It&#039;s kinda hard to describe all the amazing effects of heroin and not to mention every user has a different experience with it.<br /><br />Personally, when I get a few bags of heroin...I get excited cooking a bag up in the spoon and once I have hit a vein and push the plunger down - the intense rush and euphoria is AMAZING. I immediately feel like I&#039;m on top of the world and become overwhelmed with feelings of happiness and well being and I get extremely sociable and hyper wanting to talk to everyone. It also gives me a ton of motivation and lots of self confidence.<br /><br />The problem with heroin is addiction...it&#039;s quite easy to become addicted to if you have an addictive personality (I have some friends who are able to do it every now and then with no problems though). I would venture to guess that it took about 3 weeks of every day heroin use for me to first start experiencing physical withdrawals although it&#039;s my belief that the mental addiction is far worse.<br /><br />Summary: I love heroin but addiction can suck and if someone asked me whether they should try it or not? I would tell them to not try it but it&#039;s totally up to them and they&#039;re free to do as they please.<br /><br />EDIT: I forgot to add........sex on heroin ROCKS! and it makes you last really freaking long, your girlfriend or wife will think you&#039;re a SEX GOD!&nbsp; :D

				As a long time smoker/drinker/snorter, I have never trusted myself to go near H. I probably score near zero on the Addictive Resistance scale.<br /><br />Also, I much prefer stimulants &amp; psychedelics to downers.<br /><br />I was struck reading some of DM Turner&#039;s book (posted elsewhere on the forum) where he referred to K as &quot;psychedelic heroin&quot;. That frightened me, as I like (insufflated) K a LOT, and I can guess at what he means. It&#039;s the one drug I can fully daydream about: dark, mysterious, relaxing, mind-blowing and seductive, all at once...<br /><br />MXE is definitely a &quot;healthy&quot; option for instant reliable bliss. A methylated sibling of K, it does have some concerns attached to it (around the bladder...) but I think the jury is still out, especially given how relatively new it is. You only need a tiny amount, and even after a couple of years regular use, I am hard-pressed to find any negatives.<br /><br />What I have been getting back to lately is &quot;micro&quot; doses of smoked DMT, 10-30 mg. Fucking amazing. Easy to inhale, beautiful spin on things (nothing too heavy visually) and the warmest huggiest internal glow, like a very long slow orgasm. And nourishing, not consuming. The opposite of fiendish!<br /><br />A (very) wise person here basically said, if you follow a good path, you end up liking tryptamines above all other substances and I can definitely see what he means.&nbsp; ::)

				Opiates are just rediciously addictive. Something like morphine will actually make you feel good despite you just came out of bone surgery. <br /><br />I suppose it&nbsp; is hard to describe, but opiates just make you feel better then you ever conceived to be possible, and you will do anything to retain that sensation. <br /><br />This in itself is not really the problem, but the price of keeping up that habit will be.

				Alot of opiate/heroin addicts start off by getting in really bad accidents and doctors prescribe (overprescribe?) strong painkillers to help them thru recovery. After its over, the doctor takes them off painkillers but theyre&nbsp; addicted to the painkillers. So they go to the streets to find their meds. Then when they start running low on money and they cant afford to pay 80 dollars for a pill to get high their dealer tells them about this wonderful drug called heroin which is much cheaper and stronger than their pills. and the rest is history

				I tried prescription opiate pills, to me it was like a weed high but with no impairment, and much more euphoria. When I smoke pot, after the first hour or 2 I start to get relaxed and sleepy (regardless of indica or sativa, the tail-ends of my highs always get lazy), almost identical to the opiate high, but less intense, and more sleepy.<br /><br />That bliss, though, it took me back to the happiest I&#039;ve ever felt in my life. It wasn&#039;t intense like sex, though, it was like cuddling afterwards with someone you&#039;re completely enamored with and just feeling completely consumed by your bliss. (which i also found necessary to inform my party)<br /><br />Only tried it once, not really sure I want to acclimate my mind to those levels of happiness, I more enjoy the variety drugs offer, than the intense peaks any one may have.

Then when they start running low on money and they cant afford to pay 80 dollars for a pill to get high their dealer tells them about this wonderful drug called heroin which is much cheaper and stronger than their pills. and the rest is history<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think thats somewhat of a common misconception. most patients prescribed pain meds are started out a very low dose of either hydroconde, codeine, or oxycodone. there usually given a small one time prescription for short term pain like out patient surgery or a broken arm. the chance of a physical addiction occurring is extremely low, the chance of a psychological addiction occurring is possible but still unlikely unless they have a addictive personality. if someone was in a really bad accident or had a serious bone break on something that required a long surgery they might get something like mscontin or oxycontin with hydrocodone or oxycodone for break though. any decent doc would be able to keep someone for getting addicted in any way for at least 1-2 months. if the injury requires longer use of opiates it should be handed over to a pain management doctor. they deal exclusively with long term chronic pain management and would probably prescribe oxycontin, mscontin or possibly fent patches. with most pain management doctors your meds are tightly controlled and you have to visit them several times per month. the patient is almost always going to develop a psychical dependence as would be expected and when the medication is now longer needed a long taper will begin. a taper involves either, stabilizing on a long acting opiate like oxycotin or mscontin and slowly decreasing the dose every few weeks until you can switch to hydrocodone and continue to taper with that. if the patient had a large tolerance and or the need for some pain management during the taper they would probably be switched over to methadone a synthetic extremely long lasting opiod with nmda antagonist property&#039;s. they would then be slowly tapered until they were able to get off without going into any withdrawals. in summary if the doctor is half way decent people dont develop a recreational long term addiction without the predisposition to addiction or extraordinary circumstances. just to be clear im not a doctor just a psychotropic drug enthusiast and long term chronic pain patient currently dependent on opiates. personally i dont think anyone should use heroin unless there experienced with other opiates first. if you want to see if you might enjoy opiates without much risk i recommend that you try a low dose of either hydrocodone or oxycodone. please take the time to thoroughly research any drug legal, prescription or illicit before using it. be sure to know how to dose, what to expect, what the risks are, any possible drug interactions, and that what you have is actually what you think it is. feel free to ask me any questions you may have i have a fairly broad understanding of drugs and only want to help spread legit drug education to any and all. i would also like to note that benzos ( xanax, valium kpins ect.) potentate opiates greatly. both the risks and euphoria are potentate and its much much easier to overdose if you combine them. for example you might be able to take 1mg of xanax alone and be completely fine maybe not even all that impaired. as well 10mg of hydrocodone might be a perfectly safe and euphoric dose for you but if you were to mix 1mg of xanax and 10mg of hydrocodone you could be in real trouble. please note these dosages are very very small and even none tolerant people would most likely be fine its just a point of reference. tolerance to both benzos and opiates increases the dose you can safely take but also increases the risk you might push you dosing to high and overdose. again everyone feel free to ask me any questions you might have through pm or post in the thread. remember theres no such thing as a stupid question and be safe :)

				I&#039;m a major LSD and MDMA fan and currently extracting DMT; my curiosities about opioids/heroin are merely to see what they&#039;re all about- I somewhat presumed that since they&#039;re the most addictive/harmful that they&#039;d be the most fun, but it seems not.

				From my experience, opioids and opiates provide a unique combination of pleasure and pain.&nbsp; Though the returns diminish, opioids can provide an amount of euphoria that is unimaginable and indescribable to those who have never experienced it.&nbsp; For many, a taste of the euphoric potential is what drives an individual to eventually try heroin.&nbsp; My first overwhelming case of euphoria was when I had 10 leftover hydrocodone/APAP 5/500 pills leftover from a small surgery.&nbsp; I did a cold water extraction on 5 of them (since 5g of APAP isn&#039;t good for the liver) and also ingested 5 pills directly.&nbsp; It was absolutely incredible nodding off in a blissfully apathetic state of transcendental relaxation.&nbsp; The next morning I was sweaty and puked some.&nbsp; It was comparable to a typical hangover of mine, except I didn&#039;t have a headache and did feel somewhat anxious.&nbsp; <br /><br />Eventually I did decide to use H since I heard it was cheaper and stronger than using pills.&nbsp; Aside from a few experiences smoking some #3, I almost invariably sniff my gear.&nbsp; Though I normally just use it on the occasional weekend, I&#039;ve binged before.&nbsp; Withdrawal is not pleasant at all; puking bile, sweating, shitting, and feeling restless were the main difficulties.&nbsp; Withdrawal, I justified to myself, was something of a tax or penalty for having surrendered to temptation and dosed on 3 or more consecutive days.&nbsp; Snorting a ton of powder also didn&#039;t do me any good.&nbsp; After one binge (from a free gram of NoGen&#039;s extremely potent #4) I had really nasty tonsil stones that triggered my gag reflex and had me puking constantly for a week or two.&nbsp; One binge had me suffering through withdrawals at an inconvenient time, so I took a few maintenance doses before I had a weekend to waste in agony.&nbsp; After this binge my nose got scabbed and gross for a while, and it took a couple weeks before it healed completely.<br /><br />I still use occasionally, but I never dose on consecutive days anymore.&nbsp; I occasionally will get a heroin hangover but I don&#039;t get full withdrawals this way.&nbsp; Though the euphoria hasn&#039;t been as good as it once was, it&#039;s still very pleasant and helps me relax.&nbsp; On smaller doses it&#039;s great in social settings for me since it completely eliminates my anxiety.&nbsp; This removes my unreasonable inhibitions, but doesn&#039;t cause me to make stupid decisions unlike enough alcohol.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyhow I&#039;ve rambled on too much here, but I hope you can get a better sense of why people use opiates or heorin.

				This is an interesting topic, a nice read. I used to have a fascination with H, thinking that it must be a whole lotta fun and that I should try it sometime. Since I&#039;ve been using the internet for sourcing I look elsewhere (as in at other drugs) first, especially after my experiences with 2c-e and mxe, especially. <br />I&#039;m looking for the experiences that will leave me feeling like I come out of it a better person. Tripping can be difficult for me, just as often if not more than it has been blissful, and there have been times where I thought it best not to do it again because of the mindfuck. The worst that happens is that I come out of it happy to be alive, not craving another fix like when I&#039;ve binged on alcohol, OC&#039;s, coke, meth, and even weed. I know these things can be enjoyed and if they enhance your life than happy trails and best wishes to you.<br />I definitely relate to being wary of the addictive potential. <br /><br />I do kind of want to try some of The Scurvey Crew&#039;s opium, though ;)

				well heroin is safer than&nbsp; suboxone or methadone i suppose. those drugs are much more physically addictive and the withdrawals from them can last months. only downside is that the government wont pay for your heroin.. oh and suboxone/methadone is a great way for pharmaceutical companies to make money, they charge the government for keeping you addicted to drugs

				no all in all i think people off here getting H are relatively educated and kinda well brought up <br /><br />at least id imagine based on how to properly get everything off here. <br /><br />i just refuse to believe any drug has this auto pilot on a person. its all about the person, addictive personalities, choice, will power.<br /><br />I have done it and will do it here and there...but doing it all the time or blowing wads of cash on it? no thanks<br /><br />besides, i have sold off a bundle of remaining bags i had to an old highschool friend..who IS a junkie, because i got bored of it. i simply tested it and can see its social fun side and reckless side too.&nbsp; but practically every drugs on here can be destructive.&nbsp; <br /><br />but if anyone were to recommend, should i try this? id say no. but the same can go with coke, meth, acid, mushrooms..etc.&nbsp; if u have no strength within, ur done yo.&nbsp; <br /><br />sorry for the harsh name calling though, i agree with you, that was unnecessary , i guess i just find it weird that heroin is like THE worst drug on this site, i totally dont think so. The amount someone needs to do to be &quot;lost&quot; in it can differ from person to person, but you have to be pretty fucking dedicated.<br /><br />its like people who are addicted to cigarettes....you were never ever hooked on the first cigg or even the first pack...but you kept doing it.

I smoked cigarettes for years only at certain times, usually only when I would party on the weekends. It didn&#039;t bother me to go without cigarettes. I had to force myself into cigarette addiction because I found myself in a very dangerous, long term situation that required me to stay awake and I had limited access to caffeine. At first they really didn&#039;t taste or smell good. After chain smoking for months I couldn&#039;t quit even when though I wanted to. Eventually I quit and now the only way I can stay away from an &quot;addicted&quot; everyday all day habit is to just stay away from them completely.<br /><br />I think if a thing is fun, you have to work at keeping it that way by respecting that and controlling what you can. If you become addicted, I think the scientific term is &quot;dependent,&quot; then you can&#039;t really undo that.

				Do not&nbsp; iv , snort , im, or put it up you&#039;re ass.<br /><br />The safest war is to smoke it, on a foil.<br /><br />That way you can not overdose or die.<br />You will pass-out before it get dangerous<br /><br />Heroin should be out of your system after 5 days.<br />To use once a week should be safe.<br />To stay on the safe side you have to pick your day of the week and never do it an other day.<br />If you aint sure, keep 10 days in between<br /><br />It&#039;s better then the 7 day&#039;s so your body can recover 3 days extra.<br />A day of 10 in between and you will never get hoocked.<br /><br />7days is the minimum you will have to let in between the days you do use<br />Using&nbsp; every 5th day will hook you for sure.<br />It might take some time.<br /><br />Very few people manage to use only in the weekend.<br /><br />The kick is de dream, but subtle, opium gives a dream that is to much on the forefront.<br />The dream of Heroin is more on the background.<br /><br />You are dreaming while you are awake.<br />After using your skin can itch.<br />Your noose for example.<br />And you will trough up.<br />After vomiting the nice feeling comes...<br /><br />H gives a nice high, but I think it is too expernsive<br /><br /><br /><br />\<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t use heroin<br />There is no why.<br /><br />To many alternatives at hand. <br /><br />The herion sould be out of youre sustem after 5 days.<br />So if you stick to that day, you should not get hooked. <br />the days in between are sort, to short. <br />When you use 2 or 3 times max each month you body will be recovered<br /><br />The feeling is lik a mellow opium.<br />&nbsp;And just mellow anyway.<br />Where opium-dreams can be quite intensive.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				smoking preferred over snorting ? it gets drug to your brain faster, the feeling of a &#039;rush&#039; you tend to crave builds up.

				I didnt go through any posts after the first page but wanted to share with you advice and my thoughts on it. My advice is don&#039;t ever do it regardless of the ROA. I was living with a girl for awhile and she used so I eventually gave in and tried. I wasn&#039;t hooked immediately but after a few days of use I didn&#039;t want to live without it and when we ran out money or our connect ran out of dope we were sick. I kept my use in check at first but it quickly built up to to just having to have it. Being dope sick is no fun at all. It feels like your bone barrow is sore and every part of your body and mind just feel like shit. It&#039;s been about 4 years since I have done any and I still think about it all the time. So much so that I&#039;ve got a sample bag on the way. Any more and I&#039;d go all out. It&#039;s seriously what made me fall in love with IV&#039;ng about every substance you can b/c I keep wanting that rush I got. Just avoid it to be safe b/c it&#039;s got talons man. They dig deep into your psyche and never let go. You can stop using but you probably will never stop fiending for it.

				A lot of good points in this thread.&nbsp; This is the type of content that makes this forum so valuable.<br /><br />I would reinforce the concept of a linear progression of experimentation &gt; enjoyment &gt; dependence &gt; addiction &gt; desperation.<br /><br />We know in materialist terms that nicotine, methamphetamine, heroin are the most physically addictive drugs.<br /><br />Anyone with experience will understand that you need many doses to get addicted!&nbsp; <br /><br />Stay mindful and you can stay safe.&nbsp; Take a break and balance your hedonism with some good old fashioned aerobic exercise and healthy food.&nbsp; It does wonders.&nbsp; If you need a day or three of nasty withdrawal first, that is fine.&nbsp; Just learn your lesson and on day four get some exercise!<br /><br />Anyone with experience with addiction can admit that they chose to do their DOC many days in a row before they ended up in a bad place.&nbsp; Ideally those who are not addicted but using can be mindful of the same concept.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

How many mg of oxy do you use per dose and per day?
