				I know coke for many years,&nbsp; been using quite a lot when i was teen- than stopped completely,&nbsp; very rarely for the last few 7 years&nbsp; (maybe once in 2 years)<br /><br />Than i found SR - which is all about quality and availability, and the rest is clear :)<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; i really don&#039;t use much in quantities terms - but as you know once you start a session its very hard to stop until you are really wasted or run out of coke - i usually get the first option and than tired on morning and all this shit (i own a business and have a family and cant be too wasted... my wife gets angry at me&nbsp; :-\)<br /><br />Are you guys/gals able to stop?&nbsp; like saying i will do only 2 lines and actually do that?<br />any psychological methods to help with that from your experience?<br /><br />* i have no intention of taking any other chemical for that...

				I have redose issues to energy drink coca-cola and cannabis... but oddly enough never to stimulant drugs like coke speed or meth haha<br /><br /><br />but anyway.. it is tempting to continue but you just have to rtemeber that after the first hour any more coke is just gpoing to be wasted as the euphoria is gone.<br /><br />i just set out with the intention that im going to do my first line.. wait another 45 minutes and do another line and then put it away.<br /><br />i also try to think of it as a &quot;short experience&quot; as in - &quot;coke is a wonderful drug and i love its qualities of euphoria but it is a short experience and any more re-dosing is a waste that could be used for another day.. therefore i am going to commit to my use of this drug as a short term high and save the rest for another day. i will not re-dose anymore than 1 time in the first hour and after that hour the coke will be put away for another day. i will make the most of the experience in the short time it gives me. I understand my post-usage cravings and acknowledge that it may make me feel lousy. i will be pre[pared for that, and i know it will pass and i will thank myself next time&quot;.<br /><br /><br />

				I want to start by saying you are not alone by any means.&nbsp; The only thing I found that brings you down smoothly is an opiate, so if you aren&#039;t interested in another chemical, you may be screwed.&nbsp; Psychology will lose to physiology in almost all cases.&nbsp; Physiological responses ALWAYS precede psychological ones.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t care how much cognitive behavioral therapy you try to apply, you loaded your brain with dopamine and serotonin and every cell in your body felt great.&nbsp; Your brain cells are physiologically in pain after stopping.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not saying it can&#039;t be done, but it&#039;s hell, and it&#039;s not just &quot;in your head&quot; so to speak. Alcohol only helps, as you said, by making you pass out.&nbsp; In this scenario, the physiological, as well as psychological, intensity of the opiate high is pretty much null, and the risk of becoming dependent is actually quite minimal if that is what you are scared of.&nbsp; The opiate will simply change how your neurons respond to this pain, and therefore kill the &quot;craving&quot;.&nbsp; Seriously, just take a couple Vicoprofens with your drinks after and see how much easier it is ( stay away from anything with acetaminophen, especially with heavy drinking).

				Thanks! <br />But what you say makes me feel even worse - cause i do the same but still continue :)<br />Im usualy a very strong person, but since i started coke with SR, i feel like a little kid again who cant control himself (not in general- but at the times i do a session, also the amounts are fairly small) <br />&nbsp;A great advice i can take from what you said is - &quot; to remember i will thank myself next time&quot;. <br /><br />This is also something i had in mind in the past, i probably need to bring all my old techniques back after they have lost in the years i did not use almost any drug....<br />I like your direction cause thats exacly what i was looking for - tostart building my psychological set of mind again to have full control at my sessions .

Even with the dophamine blast, you can understand that, and react. Just need some practice which i dont have anymore, i know people kicking opiate addiction in a second cause of a strong mind :)<br />Anyway - the alcohol advice might be ok but from my experiece i do not sleep when taking both (mean, the coke effect is more dominant)

				The right mindset is the key, if you&#039;re in the right environment you&#039;ll be able to control your mindset, if you have high grade coke you won&#039;t need a lot to reach your destination (always remember that!). Saline spray, a heavy indica, a strong dose of melatonin (such as swanson&#039;s triple dose), and green tea, are all good choices from experience :)

And yeah, its the mindset - and more than that, strenght of the mind which i have lost during my sober years, <br /><br />Saline spray - i use regulary, and of course during a coke session.<br /><br />This thread acctually made me feel great - even that im in the comedown, lying in bed with laptop, not fighting and trying to sleep when i know it will not work and not doing anymore lines even that i have left a good amount of great coke,&nbsp; well i will probably be tired as shit tommorow and i did spent two hours of session more than i have planned -<br /><br />But my best gain is the fact i realised&nbsp; i should be bringin back the right state of mind for occasional timulant use in a more healthy way cause i will do it again so it least it should be done right - and next time i hope i will do it right.<br /><br />Btw , love this community - SR is a life changer if treated with respect and right planning. <br />and its not the coke talking since i stopped an over an hour ago!

So true. Its kinda like the cigarrets addiction (a habit i kicked 7 years ago in one day) only it makes you feel much better so the situation triggering the &quot;i want some&quot; are stronger<br /><br />With coke even after years of not using&nbsp; i was exited like hell and was my first SR order the minute i could :)<br /><br />And i agree and also think that if i will find a person who can do only one fat line and nothing more until the next time - i will consider him the perfect person to use cocaine :)

				So not sure if your wife is cool with this but you seem to imply that she knows you occasionally get wasted so...<br /><br />Have you tried pulling out a party dose and then just handing her your stash?<br /><br />If she&#039;s like my girl it would be easier to get her to take it in the backdoor without lube after a fight where I told her how her sister was even prettier than her during a sci-fi movie I refused to turn off even though it was date night than it would be to get my stash back.<br /><br />If she&#039;s not cool maybe a trusted friend that lives an inconvenient distance away?<br /><br />Last but not least, for about $120 you can order a safe online that will only open X number of hours after you lock it. Can set it for minutes, days, weeks. Since me and my girlfriend tend to fiend together on stuff I actually think I&#039;m going to have to pick that up. I remember spending about an hour and a half completely incapable of speech essentially both of us having a shared overdose and when we finally came to I looked over to my lovely girl who managed a smile and one tiny word:<br /><br />&quot;Bump?&quot;

				Yeah I was looking up time lock safes as a joke, found this and realized... man it would really help:<br /><br />(clearnet: http://captureddiscipline.com/CapturedDiscipline_OrderPage.html)<br /><br />Their website sucks and their may be a more mainstream commercialized version out there, I just didn&#039;t see it in my quick web search on the topic.<br /><br />Not the toughest thing in the world I suspect but if you lockup your power tools and put the key in their with your drugs it might stand a little abuse.

				I have no experience with this, <br />but I was just thinking: would some DMT be a nice way to quit an evening... <br /><br />I know using LSD can &quot;reset&quot; some things in your brain so that you don&#039;t crave the stuff afterwards - and I love to end on a little journey with Alice... but I have never heard of anyone using DMT in this manner...<br /><br />Someone has any thoughts about it? Experience?

				I have experience with LSD to stop cravings&nbsp; but only &quot;the day after&quot; cravings and not on the same session&nbsp; - with 100% success (of course they are very easy to build back once you come accross coke again :)<br /><br />The DMT sounds interesting - but i do believe in general, that using psychedelics while on coke is almost a sure way to have a comedown from hell, so i never wanted to try it...<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t do coke anymore just because of any drug i&#039;ve ever tried the more i did the more i wanted, it was the biggest challenge for me and i just had to stop 5yrs ago because for whatever reason I can&#039;t quite once i start and had to admit that and move on, plus the comedown was the worst ever for me.

I seem to suffer from this and friends don&#039;t as bad as me!<br /><br />I was sick before Christmas with a chest infection and ended up on anti-biotics and asked the doc for something to heal my sinuses which were fucked up from coke. He said the anti-biotics would clear them up which they did so I searched the net for a more natural remedy for sinuse probs. and found forums where people with sinus probs used wild oil of oregano so I ordered some and it seemed to work. It&#039;s a natural anti biotic. 3 drops per day for 5 days and left it at that. Apple cider vinegar with mother is good for it too.<br />i was clean of everything for a month too so not sure how much that helped with the oil but my head would be blocked up for ages of late.<br />Give it a go anyway. Look for the oil of oregano with 70%+ of carvacrol

				I&#039;ve a new plan!<br /><br />Pick a weekend to do coke, space the times and use it as a treat, order a gram, no more, enjoy the gram over the weekend and that&#039;s it till next time!<br /><br />I&#039;m on it 3 nights now because I had too much around calling me as it does. If I only had a gram, that would be well gone now and I&#039;d be back to normal (ish).<br /><br />I thought I was gonna be OK with it around and after tricking myself into just trying 1 or 2 lines, that was it, I was off and find it hard to stop.
