				Title: <strong>MDMA ?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I buy MDMA on here fairly often and I came across a guy in college who sells it, I haven&#039;t and nor will I ever buy off him but he showed me his MDMA and it seemed to have quite a sand-like consistency and had some bits in it which were very dark, almost black. He said the black parts are really strong and hit hard, I would&#039;ve thought they would have maybe been impurities or something? Anyone have any opinions? <br />I&#039;m not experienced in this sort of area and I just thought I&#039;d see what people have to say about it.

				i cant tell you for sure, but it sounds like a pretty poorly&nbsp; cut product.&nbsp; you could always ask him for a sample dip as a test, because taste really does help determine the quality of the product.<br /><br />and unless he just took those &quot;black&quot; parts alone i dont see how he could tell if they hit hard and strong. so i would advise against his product based off what i know from your post.&nbsp;

				Just dirty polymeric crap clinging to the crystals from where the chemist didn&#039;t clean his product. MDMA comes in all colours but if it&#039;s truly pure it will be blindingly white or absolutely clear. The colour has absolutely nothing to do with the effects, how clean it feels etc though. Because the impurities are often very highly coloured, it only takes a fraction of a percent to discolour the product. On SR there&#039;s some filthy looking MDMA being sold which is actually pretty pure.<br /><br />Last year I had some MDMA with little dark purple chunks in it, the dealer told me some bullshit about how it had been smuggled over in wine bottles. Dealers always have to spin a tale to justify selling impure product.
