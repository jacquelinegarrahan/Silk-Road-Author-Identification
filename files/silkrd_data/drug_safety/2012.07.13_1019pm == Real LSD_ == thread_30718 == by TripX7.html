				Hi, I&#039;m new here and about to make my first purchase :P Looking to experience some real LSD, in the past I believe I have taken LSA or some other knock off sold as LSD... Anyway, I would just like to know which sellers on here sell real LSD and not an imposter. So if anybody has &quot;confirmation&quot; as in they have tested the product and has bought multiple times from that seller etc. etc, please tell who i can trust. thanks :D

				Just check out most of the highly rated vendors in the LSD section. Pretty much everything in there is going to be legit. Not cheap.... but itl be legit.<br /><br />Also if what you had was one a blotter it probably was not LSA. LSA is not common at all on blotters. Was probably some research chemical! Hope this helps a little bit.

				Its really hard to fake LSD tabs, especially with LSA. You can`t fit a lot of LSA on a tab compared to LSD. You`d have to take a few tabs (5 or more) to be dosed properly by LSA. You can identify LSA tabs by feeling them sometimes, they`ll have this sticky/icky feeling. As for your question, it seems like you got an answer.

				I always wonder ho you, fresh in psychedelics, know that something is a real LSD...?<br />I am quite old bastard, and I grew up in different world without Research Chemicals. There was always only strong or weak LSD, now we have such a range of psychedelics substances that you just cannot be sure that what you eat is a real LSD if you have never tried it before RC&#039;s...

				people can go on all day about lsd and how none of the l on the street is legit but i will tell you one piece of information you should never forget.<br />anything in the microgram range (lsd-wise) is going to be TASTELESS. <br />if its bitter its a spitter, is the old hippy saying.<br />if its a small blotter, dissolves without taste, and comes on in about 60 minutes, its lsd. the experience can vary each time, but you will know if you let it dissolve in your mouth and there is no taste. i had some microdots that had a sort of strange taste and they gave me super weird body feelings but i loved it. after having done confirmed lsd, nbome, dox, and 2cx, i would say that it was a DOX substance inside of that microdot.<br />thats the only time ive ever been fooled into thinking what i took was lsd when it wasnt. still had a great time though.<br />its not hard to tell if you have legit lsd though regardless of how the experience unfolds... but dont try guessing before you have taken confirmed lsd.<br /><br /><br />

				Find the LSD Avengers topic in the rumour mill and go with a proven vendor from the first post. Some people on SR still try to pass RC&#039;s off as LSD but they get outed and the good vendors have the real stuff.
