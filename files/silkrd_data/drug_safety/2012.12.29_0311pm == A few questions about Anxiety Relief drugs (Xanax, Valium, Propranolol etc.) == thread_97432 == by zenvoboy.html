				I had a big slap in the face in my personal life recently, and it&#039;s made me realise how unhappy I am with my life / the way I am.<br /><br />Part of what I want now is to get out and socialise more, after realising how harmful it has been to me staying behind closed doors and avoiding social situations just because of a little anxiety etc.<br /><br />I want to meet new people. Learn from them and grow. Maybe even find that special person.<br /><br />But I do suffer from a bit of social anxiety. I am shy, and terrible at small-talk with people I haven&#039;t met before. I struggle to pee at urinals, and have been that way for a few years now, but all this time I&#039;ve let those things stop me from going out altogether. I&#039;m sick of it.<br /><br />Soooo... I&#039;m thinking drugs maybe like Xanax, Propranolol or Valium, could be perfect for me to take prior to stepping out of my door and going on a night out with my friends, to relieve that initial anxiety that usually stops me altogether, and then get drunk and enjoy myself for the rest of the night.<br /><br />But is it safe to mix drugs like these with alcohol? Or which ones are/are not safe to mix?<br /><br />Also, any other suggestions other than the three drugs I listed are welcome. There seems to be so many anxiety related drugs out there, I&#039;ve just kept it basic with the &quot;most famous&quot; ones.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read that most of these drugs are things you are supposed to take regularly? E.g. 3 doses per day, every day. Is this correct?<br />Honestly, I&#039;d prefer if there was a drug that I could take only when necessary (i.e. - When plans are made to go out with my friends, I can take it an hour or so before going out and feel the anxiety &quot;wash away&quot;)<br />Or can I do that with the drugs I mentioned? Only swallow a pill on the days I need it.<br /><br />Probably could&#039;ve googled this. I apologise. I prefer getting my information from the wonderful and wise people that I trust on this forum though&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Edit: Also, I&#039;m from the UK, and currently my only way of getting this stuff is SR, and only want to order domestically at the moment. Which actually rules out Propranolol for me... Unless anybody else on here from the UK has ordered similar stuff from overseas before and had it arrive successfully without a customs charge? (If so, please tell me which vendor(s) you bought from)

				I wouldn&#039;t suggest drinking when taking any Benzodiazepine unless your goal is to blackout and not remember anything. Benzos and alcohol impair your judgement and you run the risk of respiratory depression. They aren&#039;t a good mix. I dont&#039;t know alot about Propanolol, I thought it treated hypertension. If your going to take a benzo I would suggest Clonazepam (Klonopin) its designed to be taken for situations that give you anxiety. You put it under your tongue and as it dissolves your anxiety will go away. It doesnt taste bad either. In my opinion I would take Clonazepam over any other benzo because of the almost instant onset. <br /><br />Be careful with any benzo its easy to take too much. I personally mixed alcohol with benzo&#039;s and have ruined a good friend of mines wedding. Friends have blacked out and been robbed. My brother even wrecked my car and parked it back where he got it and had no clue that it even happened. If you take too much or mix with alcohol odds are you will do something you regret.

				I don&#039;t have any experience with anxiety relief drugs, so I can&#039;t help you there.&nbsp; I do however know of a person who mixed alcohol and benzos and stopped breathing, his best mate had to give him mouth to mouth (and he wasn&#039;t to happy with that at all!!).<br /><br />I have recently read an article of a man who &#039;recovered&#039; from shyness and it might be of help to you: <br />(clearnet warning:) <br />&nbsp;www.raptitude.com/2009/04/how-to-always-have-something-better-to-talk-about-than-the-weather/

				Hmm. I&#039;ve done a (tiny) bit of reading and seem to be getting mixed messages. A lot of people though are saying it&#039;s safe in moderation, you just have to be careful, because the benzos make the effects of alcohol stronger, so it wouldn&#039;t take as many drinks as it usually would to end up passed out in a ditch.<br /><br />Thanks for that link, it was a good read. I think I do a lot of what he said already, but maybe not enough. I guess being more aware of the specific people I&#039;m with would help, so I can talk to them about things they&#039;re interested in, rather than worrying that I&#039;m not very good at &quot;general conversation&quot; with &quot;people in general&quot;. Although the only problem with that would be trying to find the balance between being interested in interesting people, and forcing fake interest in the hope of gaining acceptance and not to be perceived as shy.

				I am glad you found it an interesting read. <br />Forcing and/or faking interest doesn&#039;t seem like a good idea. I mostly pick up on that when people do that and I really dislike it. But if you do have sincere interest, go for it and expand your comfort zone. And people may surprise you.&nbsp; :)<br />Wishing you good luck on your adventures.

				As the previous posters have stated taking benzos with alcohol can be extremely dangerous. <br />I also suffer from anxiety, though it is very extreme and sometimes keeps me from work etc. I used to self medicate (still do when I can, but more responsibly, without alcohol - and not having a ton on hand) and I&#039;d get clonazepam off a friend and have a couple beers. The problem with this is mostly memory, like you take 1mg clonazepam and two beers, then you take another mg while having a third beer. *Then* you can&#039;t remember if you took any more and end up taking the rest over the course of the night and you wake up the next day with all your pills gone having no memory after 10pm. Not a good situation. This may not be a problem for you, but I have a bit of a drug problem to be honest, so.<br />I, personally, never did anything I regretted (except eating all my pills in one night), as I feel the alcohol itself has that doing things you regret later effect and is not to do with the benzos. And I have been LUCKY enough not to die from some of the things I&#039;ve done.<br /><br />Benzos are also depressents and to take an effective dose to ward off anxiety, in my case, makes you feel kind of drunk without the euphoric/fun-ness that alcohol gives. Its&#039;s not a fun going-out-and-socializing feeling in my opinion.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d give another opinion/experience. Be safe in whatever you decide to do, and if you do decide to mix alcohol and benzodiazepines together limit *both.TD<br /><br /><br />*****Benzodiazepines (Xanax, klonopin, Valium, etc) are generally NOT prescribed 3x/day. They are mostly prescribed to take as needed for anxiety/panic attacks, most of the time along with an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication such an an SSRI or MAOI (like Zoloft, Prozac, etc). The reason they(DR.s) do not like to prescribe these drugs to take everyday is they have a very high potential for abuse, you can also become dependent and build tolerance. I think benzo withdrawal is one of the very dangerous drugs to withdraw from, but I could be wrong about that.

				Great post H, thanks. I&#039;ve popped your karma cherry :)<br /><br />I&#039;m beginning to think benzo&#039;s, for the situation of making me less anxious before going out to socialise at pubs/clubs etc. - are probably not the answer. I think I want something that actually gives more confidence and talkativeness, rather than simply taking away some anxiety. MDMA feels awesome, but I&#039;d prefer something I can just have a little amount of, or keep bumping a few times during the night, rather than be rolling off my face (plus a added risks of dehydration when mixing MDMA and alcohol). Plus I couldn&#039;t do that on a regular basis, and wouldn&#039;t really want to be rolling on MDMA in a simple pub/club setting.<br /><br />Not that I&#039;ve tried it, but I imagine cocaine would work, but it&#039;s just too expensive for me. I&#039;m thinking of trying speed or MDPV which are pretty cheap, but I&#039;m not sure how much euphoria/confidence/talkativeness they give you.<br /><br />I guess I just need to research everything that&#039;s out there and find what I think might be best.

				Thanks Zenvoboy!<br /><br />And good luck trying to figure it out.. I was also thinking coke might be up your alley but then again, perhaps not.. I&#039;m not sure how it would effect you, but it never made me talkative and out-going/crazy like you see in the movies and on TV haha<br />Speed might be good, when I was younger and started using methylphenidate that made me very talkative and less inhibited, but I took a lot (60mg).. It did help when I was nervous about an interview or something in school. I also never wrote a paper not on speed, it was the only way I could concentrate long enough but you&#039;re not writing papers..<br /><br />If you do figure out the right mix or chemical, maybe let us know? I&#039;m curious...

				you may have depression-induced anxiety.&nbsp; Many people go to the Dr. complaining of symptoms similar to yours, and as it happens they are clinically depressed. Personally, I&#039;d recommend you try Wellbutrin as it acts on dopamine and norepinephrine rather than serotonin.<br /><br />Klonopin is the only benzo I&#039;d recommend you take at this point due to your inexperience with this class of drugs.&nbsp; Drinking with Xanax in public is a recipe for disaster, you will probably either steal something in a store, and walk out with it in your hand as&nbsp; if you&#039;d bought it. A worse result, and one I have witnessed several times, is people drinking on xanax and blacking out on the street.&nbsp; One person at a place I used to work as a summer job did this, became disoriented, and died of exposure in the cold.<br /><br />Klonopin would manage your anxiety and allow you to lose your social inhibitions and I&#039;d bet the farm that you&#039;d have absolutely no trouble emptying your bladder in a public restroom.&nbsp; If you must drink on this med, do so lightly, a little alcohol multiplies the effect the klonopin quickly.

				Thanks&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Popped your karma cherry too minister&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll have a read about everything mentioned. And I&#039;ll probably just get some Speed anyways, to see if that helps at all - I was always gonna try it at some point anyway, might as well make it now.<br /><br />Some people seem to consider MDPV to be a sort of cheap replacement for cocaine, so I&#039;ll probably see what that&#039;s like too.

				I&#039;d recommend either Adderall (dextroamphetamine + levoamphetamine) or Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine).&nbsp; I find the speedy high to be much more pleasurable than MDPV.&nbsp; MDPV also has a litany of health risks associated with it that it does not share with Adderall or Dexedrine.&nbsp; These include a high incidence of psychosis and cardiac arrest or infarction in high doses.

				Propranolol will only mask the physical symptoms of anxiety and not the mental ones. I do take Propranolol before things like presentations or interviews etc as it really calms me down. It works by blocking beta receptors in the brain and it stops the production of adrenaline. Although i do &quot;feel&quot; nervous and anxious... my body doesn&#039;t react in any kind of way... eg face going bright red, quivering voice, shaky/sweaty hands etc.... and knowing that i don&#039;t look nervous actually works for my very well. I do not know what country you are in but im in the UK and i just went to my doctor explaining my &quot;stage fright&quot; and she gave me the prescription. I do recommend it.

The ground rule is that benzo&#039;s and alcohol do no mix well. Passing out in a ditch isn&#039;t that likely with moderate amounts, but the combination can result in a dangerous condition called respiratory depression in some people. This most basically boils down to stopping breathing in your sleep for some time. In most people the breathe reflex will still kick in at some point before CO2 blood levels reach dangerous values, but in some it does not, resulting in dying in your bed. <br /><br />Many people combine them anyway, and there are some pointers to safety there:<br /><br />First of all, take a short acting benzo like xanax, do not use valium. Limit the dose of xanax to 1 mg as an absolute ceiling, try managing with less (0.75 or even 0.50 give some relieve to many people - enough to function without the anxiety being gone completely).<br /><br />Once you have started drinking, never take any extra. Alcohol itself is a very strong anxiolytic, so once drinking a few glasses there really is no need to take any more xanax. The half life of xanax is in the order of 6 hours. On a night out the xanax will be removed from your system as the alcohol kicks in. As the night progresses you will get more drunk from alcohol, but less affected by xanax. Over the course of 6 hours you will have lost half of the xanax you took, yet ingested enough alcohol not to need it at that point. <br /><br />I realize the combination has its dangers even when taking precautions, but the key issue is not to fall asleep with both benzo&#039;s and alcohol at high concentrations in your system. Replacing xanax with alcohol over the course of a night can help with that if you take it slow, though the risk is never eliminated. <br /><br />Also, do not attempt to drive when taking the combination even in small amounts. A tablet of xanax combined with alcohol below the legal driving limit can impair you greatly. If you were to fade away for a few seconds that&#039;d not be a big danger to your health normally, but if you&#039;re operating a car you&#039;ll end up hitting something before you know it, literally.
