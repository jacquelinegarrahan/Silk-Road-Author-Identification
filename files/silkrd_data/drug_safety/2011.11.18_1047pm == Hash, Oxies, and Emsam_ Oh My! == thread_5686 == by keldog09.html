				This is a three part question. Get ready.<br /><br />What&#039;s the best method to smoke hashish? I&#039;m a pretty seasoned toker, but I&#039;ve only smoked hash once and I was too wasted to remember it well enough to repeat the process. From the tid bits I&#039;ve read online, it appears that I should be able to smoke hash like I smoke h (tin foil method). I wanna get the biggest bang for my buck though.<br /><br />Keeping the tin foil method in mind, could I mix a little hash and oxycodone (obviously pure oxycodone) and smoke them together on the foil for shits and giggles? I almost always parachute or plug pills, but I&#039;ve successfully smoked morphine so I think it could work. <br /><br />The third question is somewhat random: if I were to ingest something of the 2C family would it interact badly (i.e. psychosis, death) with the Emsam (selegiline transdermal system, 6 mg/24h) that I have to take? I&#039;m aware that it enhances everything (and I mean everything. Three bong hits of dank and I&#039;m done even though I smoke everyday) and that this can be especially dangerous when using psychedelics. I&#039;m not very familiar with MOAIs and the 2Cs, so any help would be wunderbar! I would just cease taking it, but when I do I hear voices in my head and it&#039;s quite upsetting. :(

				Thanks for the info mrgrey! Really appreciate it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">depends on the hash type</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m looking at this listing specifically: http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/9458<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">also about the maoi, i really dont know the answer, but i would seriously suggest researching this yourself and not trusting what someone on a forum posts. maois have some pretty serious interactions with certain drugs, sometimes lethal. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve looked pretty hard for a reliable source, but forums seem to be the only place where the two are covered in conjunction. Plus I just like to hear others experiences to see if I&#039;d even like the experience assuming it wouldn&#039;t put me in the hospital lol. I&#039;m very careful, so no worries!
