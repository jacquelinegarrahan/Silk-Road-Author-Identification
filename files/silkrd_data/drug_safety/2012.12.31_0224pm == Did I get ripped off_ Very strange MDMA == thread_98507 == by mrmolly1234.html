				Hi all, 1st I would like to thank everyone for any help feedback. Got some great molly off the road a few times, small moon rocks of white maybe a little yellow but toatlly white when crushed. Amazing rolls. Anyways my favorite vendor was selling very dark mdma which I read was bad not properly washed etc. So I decided to try a new vendor with great feedback tons of transaction great reviews. His looked to be the same off white ive been getting. Anyways I get the package fast but what i find inside im not to happy with. Everything is already crushed and it is brown/light brown, def not tan but BROWN. It does not have the shimmer or crystaly look my other stuff had when held in the light. It smeels VERY strongly of liquorice where my other stuff was very faint smell. It is also somewhat sticky, sticks to the bag a little more and also if I squeze it together it clups together momentairly. Now here is the kicker, i did marquise mecke and simons test and it passed with flying colors, very fast and strong reaction mdma positive. And alot of other people gave this product great reviews saying it was flame. Im big on harm reduction and have been piped in the past horrible time and actully thats how i found this site ;) So what does everyone think? Throw it out and get new stuff only a g not much of a loss, try acatone wash? Never done before but think I can after reading about it. Leave as is and try a small test dose 1st, thx for your help everyone

				Color does not represent quality. Unless you&#039;re getting some green MDMA or some shit&nbsp; :P<br /><br />But really, I&#039;ve had stuff just like you&#039;re describing and its always been fire! Especially since you tested it too man, I think you&#039;re good to go. It would be a waste throwing it out.

				Yeah man, I remember when my friend showed me brown/tan molly for the first time (I was way younger and previously thought that all &quot;pure&quot; MDMA had to be white). I thought it was weird until I hit it and went flying&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />You will be fine man, and I think you reassured yourself by marquis testing it. Happy rolling, and be safe!

				If it passed the regent test then you should be good to go.&nbsp; The color of the MDMA does not not indicate the quality!!!

				Color does not usually matter, but I&#039;ve heard great things about brown MDMA, I think it&#039;s called fire MDMA, I have no idea why though.
