				I left some potentially hazardous information that I&#039;d like to clear up; the other topic was deleted. Please DO NOT follow any iso/oven recrystallization techniques as it is very flammable and could lead to disastrous or fatal consequences if a spark or source of ignition is there.&nbsp; This applies to a lot of other solvents, such as xylene. Very sorry for misinformation.

				Xylene in the oven... sounds like it was an exciting night.<br /><br />Hope the damage was minimal.

I&#039;ve actually never done it with xylene-but I have made &#039;Spice&#039; by evaporating small amounts of iso in an infrared oven. No damage was incurred, but I figured I&#039;d leave this here for a bit in case anyone read my other thread and thought it was a good idea.

				Thanks for taking responsibility and admitting your mistake. Glad some people here still take accountability for their actions, even in the veil of anonymity.<br /><br />And going back to the scaleless measurement, I would more than likely suggest dissolving soluble substances in a high proof ethanol/water tincture (e.g. everclear), and just taking small amounts of that, since the amount of ethanol in said tincture would almost never be enough to actually alter the drug&#039;s effects of you make it concentrated enough.<br /><br />However, my number one recommendation, as before, is just BUY A GODDAMN SCALE lol.<br />I got a 0.001 g (milligram) scale off amazon for $20 2 years ago, and it still works to this day. <br />I would NEVER trust it with ultra-sensitive substances such as the NBOMEs, but it works fantastically for anything with an active dose in the 10+ mg range (e.g. MDXX drugs and tryptamines).<br />The small investment is truly worth it in the long run.<br /><br /><br />
