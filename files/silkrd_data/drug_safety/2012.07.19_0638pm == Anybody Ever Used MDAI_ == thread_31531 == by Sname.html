				I see one listing for MDAI on SR but no reviews. Granted it is uncontrolled currently in the US, but I&#039;d love to hear about people&#039;s experiences with MDAI. I haven&#039;t heard a lot of talk about it on the forums here though so maybe I won&#039;t get any responses. <br /><br />In the alternative, if you have tried another analogue or RC similar to MDMA that you prefer, I&#039;d like to hear about that as well.<br /><br />Thanks everybody!

				Hey I have and HATED it... ItÂ´s the worst tasting, foulest smelling shit on earth, I threw my guts up for about 2 hours whilst rushing slightly... Nowhere near as good as MDMA dude..

				I&#039;ve tried it once and I thought that it had little euphoria, More like a background feeling or undertone. its what the FDA would of picked over mdma&nbsp; if they were to ever use those type of compounds&nbsp; in Psychotherapy legally or something lol. mine was brownish tan in color and I got it from Georgia, not on sr , about 4yrs ago. if your looking for an mdma substitute. I&#039;d say 4mec&nbsp; was. prettty close, it had the warm of chest and eye fluttering aspects , but no energy the type you closed your eyes and cacooned yourself.&nbsp; methylone isn&#039;t bad either it works with the same receptors as mdma, you just have to dose right or you&#039;ll miss the train out forest..sorry bout formatting and spelling, I&#039;m on a phone at the memento .<br />

				There&#039;s a lot of bad MDAI out there. The best MDAI I had was sparkly white. Pretty sure most tan MDAI is very iffy. 200mg bombed gave me a pretty strong high for 1.5-2 hours (total duration ~3-4.5hr). It&#039;s a more sedating roll than MDMA or mephedrone. It&#039;s very nice when combined with a high-dopamine drug like 4-MEC, 4-MMC.

Tread carefully, we don&#039;t know much about this drug.
