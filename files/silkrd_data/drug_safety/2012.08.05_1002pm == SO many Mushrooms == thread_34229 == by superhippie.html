				Different kinds have different levels of potency and they feel a little different. Nothing too different, plenty of my friends can&#039;t tell the difference between strains, I think I can sometimes but honestly I may just be tricking myself. Cubensis is the way to go in my opinion.

				There is no potency difference between the family of cubensis.&nbsp; No penis envy&#039;s are not stronger.&nbsp; It depends on how it was grown, the other family, cyanesceans, carry almost twice the psilocin content compared to cubensis

				as they say on the shroomery, &quot;a cube is a cube is a cube&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />don&#039;t worry about the strain, just find a good price from a reputable dealer and buy whatever cubensis they got.&nbsp;

Always better than shitty brown caps.

				I&#039;ve noticed some differences between strains, but set &amp; setting changes the trip SO much as well. I&#039;ve taken shrooms in my room, friend&#039;s house, hiking trails, and psytrance parties. Smoking weed will also make the trip different, and the feeling varies between how you smoked (vaped, pipe, bong, etc).

We&#039;d spend the day mildly tripping while collecting, such a clean high, real laughing shrooms, you&#039;d get quite creative on them, i had a friend who would draw some amazing stuff under the influence.<br />Nothing there now though, they probably sprayed them off, the place got quite famous for them after a while.<br />&nbsp;
