				Title: <strong>Methadone Withdrawl</strong><br />

				I&#039;ve been taking a small dose of methadone for a few years now for nerve pain. About 30mg a day 10mg/3x a day but I don&#039;t always take them or if I do, I&#039;ll take the whole 20-30mg at once and skip a day or 2 (it stays in system for 2 days which is why I can&#039;t go past 2 days b4 withdrawl starts). The way I take them leaves lots of extra left over &amp; I basically have a collection going. But I want to stop taking them with as little withdrawl as possible.<br /><br />Has anyone done this? Is there a successful way to do it?<br /><br />Next problem is I still need pain meds but really don&#039;t like the whole addiction thing.....isn&#039;t there any decent pain med that doesn&#039;t kill your mind and make u dependant onit?<br />Over the years its been really messing with my head and crystal meth is the only thing to bring me back to myself for the most part but again.,,,having trouble actually getting that here lately. A really decent connection would be awesome but I know there are no guaratees with those kind of things... <br /><br />Ok I&#039;m feeling a little better getting that out. Thanks :)<br /><br />

				I took Methadone for about a week. Oral administration, which I presume you&#039;re talking about here, as well. I got withdrawals from it, which I treated with Heroin, which I admit is usually a poor idea, but I think a good idea can be garnered out of it: another drug can be helpful in easing your addiction.<br /><br />Eventually what you want to do is taper off your usage, but I think that&#039;s difficult with something you&#039;ve been using for so long. I&#039;m obviously not a doctor or anything, but I believe Gabapentin (neurontin) is a product available on SR capable of treating opiate dependence. If you were to taper yourself onto Gabapentin slowly while slowly tapering off Methadone, I think it might be easier for you to quit the Gabapentin since it&#039;s new.<br /><br />This could theoretically work with all sorts of different drugs, but basically whenever I&#039;m addicted to something I find something to replace it for an even shorter time period, and I always find the newer one easier to quit than the old one.<br /><br />But, as more legal-friendly advice, you might want to talk to your doctor about your desire to go off the medication. He might support your desire to do so, in which case he could be an even greater help (ie, actually understanding the BEST methodology for doing so based on clinical research).<br /><br />I wish you the best of luck. =]

				Actually that does work....whenever I have the C. Meth, I don&#039;t even think about taking the methadone. I don&#039;t get addicted to the Cmeth either, I just like it. <br /><br />I actually tried nuerontin (yeah can&#039;t spell it lol) and it made me kinda sleepy without enough pain relief so I&#039;m not sure... thanks for helping!

				I am not telling you what to do or anything, but do you see a doctor about your nerve pain? It could be the sign of something more serious, and may not be good to ignore. Not trying to scare you, just trying to look out for a fellow SR user :) . Anyway, AFAIK your opioid analgesics are going to be the most effective pain relievers, so basically to get that kind of relief addiction is just part of the game. Methadone is a particularly nasty one though, as its withdrawal symptoms last MUCH longer than those of a short-acting agonist like Heroin, or Oxycodone. If I were you I would honestly order a few norcos or something to help ease your way through it, as kicking methadone can be very rough. Thankfully, you are on a really low dosage -- a buddy of mine recently kicked 180mg/day of methadone, took him about 3 months to feel totally normal he told me. Once you&#039;ve kicked it, I honestly don&#039;t know what to tell you to take for pain (at least I don&#039;t know any that aren&#039;t opiates). Think you might need to consult the doctor on that as well.&nbsp;

It didn&#039;t make me pass out sleepy, didn&#039;t feel &quot;drugged&quot;, helped pain &amp; I could function better.....I was never told about the long term effects. I get less motivated as time goes by &amp; I notice my mind isn&#039;t as sharp as it was.....these are subtle slow effects but I&#039;m noticing them &amp; hate it.<br /><br />I get some burning like feeling on my skin but only in various patches all around....thankfully not a lot but for instance, my left forarm gets very sensitive &amp; even a shirt sleeve can be uncomfortable touching the area. Its almost like a skin surface burn feeling. I know its weird.<br /><br />My pain doc likes to push things they might pay him more for.....or stuff I don&#039;t want like fentanyl patches. It takes forever to try things his way so SR is great.<br /><br />I have high tolerances to things that would kill the average person &amp; that makes it tougher.<br /><br />Thanks for response -)
