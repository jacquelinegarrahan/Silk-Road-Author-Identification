				Hey Guys,<br /><br />So, for the very first time ever I tried medical marijuana about 35mg (total) on 6/26 and&nbsp; 7/5 well, finally pain management called and was all like &quot;come in for your initial appoint this upcoming Thursday!&quot; So, now I have a Thursday appointment and I&#039;m really spooked because I think they&#039;re gonna drug test me as standard procedure. <br /><br />I&#039;m not ready to discuss or admit to Marijuana usage especially since it was my first time using it ever and I used it because of the pain. I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;ll test positive this week on Thursday or if I&#039;ll be able to blame a positive result on the oxycodone I take regularly? <br /><br />Please advise!<br /><br />Thanks!

				It will be in your system, because you&#039;re not a regular user it should only be for a few weeks. To be honest with you I would tell your doc, you have nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. It is so so so much safer and better for you then oxycontin, your doctor would probably be happy to get you off OC and onto marijuana.

				yah - I&#039;m all for being honest with my Dr. thing is my family doesn&#039;t know I tried it once - it is a discussion we need to have but I&#039;m not ready for it so, I&#039;m less worried about my Dr. than I am my family...

				I get the message that you are probably in your teens, which changes the situation. But honestly I think it&#039;s best to be honest, quiet some time ago when I was 17 (this was before the days were people thought marijuana could be medicinal) I started smoking weed, I thought my parents would be disapproving so I hid it from them. One day my Mom found my stash and we talked about it and she was cool with it. It made life so much easier and made me feel a lot more comfortable about smoking. Be honest with your family kid, it really makes life easier. Especially if you are using marijuana for medicinal reasons, I&#039;m sure after some explaining they would much prefer you smoking marijuana then using OC.

				Depends what they&#039;re checking for. It might just be a blood screen to make sure your liver enzymes and stuff are OK before giving you any other medications. Only if they specifically scan for THC would they know about the MJ. There are supposedly some good &#039;detox&#039; products out there that might get you below the detectable limit before the appt. I have not tried any such product.

				Does it really matter what they find in this test?<br /><br />If it were employee drug screening it could be a problem, but this seems to be some medical test for blood levels of a number of substances. In a medical setting admitting you smoking some pot is not that much of a deal. Perhaps they will ask why you did so, and how much you took, and if it provided any relief.<br />

				Firstly, I am in my mid-20s. I have an overprotective family because, a sibling of mine passed away from a Heroin Overdose at a young age.<br /><br />I personally am not like my sibling. I am only on SR to get pain medication that I&#039;m currently having trouble obtaining. (My family has been withholding my medications for fear I&#039;ll end up like my sibling and its exceptionally irritating and a constant battle with them to the point where I&#039;m considering legal action myself) and doctors are hesitant to prescribe because of what happened with my sibling.<br /><br />Secondly, it DOES matter what they find I have on this potential drug test. <br /><br />I suffer from EXTREME chronic pain and if I come up positive - they pain clinic is likely to NOT prescribe any opioid pain medication. I have this appointment to get help so I don&#039;t have to be on SR to get what I need.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have no problem telling the Dr. &quot;Hey look, I was desperate - I was in so much pain, I tried Marijuana once in all of my 24years of life ... now I just need your help so I don&#039;t have to resort to marijuana or other methods of obtaining medication&quot; BUT -- translating that to my parents who I&#039;m considering legal action against is a whole other story.

				It depends on what kind of test they do. If they do a urine test and this is your first time, it will be out of your system in 3 days. (the more regularly you use it, the longer it will linger).<br /><br />Good luck!

				hey iamglover<br /><br />i saw this post and i had to chime in.<br /><br />im currently in pain management, but i dont have a pain contract so i dont have to drug test. ive been getting percocet 10s for the last 5 months for chronic back pain. i also smoke weed, so i know the time eventually will come when i will have to come clean to my doctor.<br /><br />BUT..and this is a BIG BUT<br />i am on [CLEARNET] spine-health.com forums and people have been denied medications (especially opiates) and are dismissed as drug seekers, even for something as simple as weed being found in your system. once labeled a drug seeker, it will be very hard for you to find treatment<br /><br />i dont want to scare you, just be prepared. you only had a small amount so i doubt it will be in your system long, try and postpone the appointment for a couple of weeks

				So pain management went well. They prescribed some good things (no opiates) but we have a solid plan going forward and its stratus quo for my opiates. AND Best of all this clinic didn&#039;t drug test me. They didn&#039;t even ask about illegal drugs - they did ask if I wear my seat belt though, which was interesting but I can see why they asked it (risk assessment). So yah that was my experience -I&#039;m glad it went the way it did.
