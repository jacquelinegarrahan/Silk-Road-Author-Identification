				so at a music festival this year i took some random pill of some random guy that asked if i wanted to buy one.. needless to say this was a stupid idea and i ended up missing out on the headline act (SHM). im trying to find out what it might of been because after the intense comeup it was pretty fucking cool! the pill was litteraly just some pill with all kinds of random ass speckles in it, no print. <br /><br />anyways so i took it and started to come up about 1hr - 1.5hr after i took it.. was in mosh for headline acted and was extremely nausous (never been this bad before) head spinning and coulding stand up at all.. anyways this continued for about 40-50mins of nausousness and massive up and downs (within about 1min of each other.. would feel happy then sick) when finally i was in a walkable state<br /><br />so after the comeup he effects for me were<br /><br />euphoria<br />massive pupil dialation<br />annoying as fuck (talking to everyone possible) <br />then i would get angry and stare at people eyes wide open<br />i couldnt feel my heart beat however i made my friend check who said it was fucking insanely high<br />after the concert i started getting real nervous and not talking to anyone or looking at anyone, just looking at the ground thinking everyone wanted to fight me or something..<br /><br />thinking it was some bad e or something i tried to keep cool, then on the bus home was when things started to get fucking weird.. <br /><br />my friend put his thumb on his nose and i followed suit... and couldnt stop, it felt as if i had a massive snot thing up my nose and i was trying to blow/pick it out and just kept at it.. <br />then i noticed that i started to feel things that my friends were talking about... like having have a grased knee and then i could feel as if i did too..<br /><br />then someone brought up when i broke my collarbone.. i couldnt move my whole arm when he said that, i could litteraly feel the pain of when i broke my collarbone.<br /><br />felt things that werent actually happening to me; stepping on prickles, wetting my pants, getting my tounge stuck on ice, trying to pop non-existant pimples....&nbsp; a whole heap of weird shit!<br /><br />i couldnt feel the freezing cold weather either until my friend mentioned how cold it was then i be came insanely cold<br /><br />&nbsp;this was some crazy shit sold to me as e.. but from past experience it most definately was not.<br /><br /><br />anyone have any idea what it could be? i know there is so much shit it could be but any clue at all? probs just a fuckin whole heap of chems or something lol.. <br /><br />cheers. <br /><br />edit:<br /><br />i slept in my friends car that night by myself... still effected by it... still picking at my nose and thinking i was going to stay like that forever... was really quite scary.<br /><br />

				Never heard of such a crazy mash up of effects before from any drug would really like to hear what others think it might have been sounds like a combination of drugs but what i dont have a clue, probably a homemade pill with alot of legal RC&#039;s in it! But that sounds like a pretty awful experience at least your ok though! Be careful next time and dont just buy of randoms unless they really seem like they know what there talking about when you ask questions its pretty easy to pick out the dodgy dealers from the real deal ones. Peace!

				The nausea and hour-long come up make me think mescaline but mescaline would not be cost effective to sell as an e pill it seems. Maybe one of the RCs that are structurally close to mescaline like a 2cx or 2c-T-x?

				Yea, this kinda sounds like mdpv as DJsmiles said. My first trip on mdpv wasnt exactly like that, but i could believe it if it was mixxed with something. But now....it seems you&#039;ll be on a mission to find this shit on the road. chances are someone will know exactly what this is

				Who knows what could have been in there... i wouldn&#039;t be inclined to take pills form people i don&#039;t know or trust by reference. <br /><br />Considering the effects it could be mdma tainted with atropine, but such things are very hard to determine on experiences alone.<br /><br />You should be extremely wary of drugs sold like that though. I remember people selling 50 mg doses of vallium as xtc om festivals - not to recreate the proper experience, but just to be able to flee the scene before any of their clients came to well enough to start complaining.

				wow, that sucks. does not sound pleasant at all. 6+ hours doesn&#039;t sound long, did you have long lingering effects after the peak?

				It does, but at least in ended well in the long run.<br /><br />Taking drugs from untrusted suppliers clearly has its dangers, and could result in overdose, poisoning and such at some point.<br /><br />Dealers at festivals and such are more likely to con people, as they have no reputation to risk, and will be long gone by the time you feel like complaining if they sell cheaper sedatives as stimulants.
