				So what if you had a party at the beach once a month or so for people dying of cancer, people who are anxious about death.&nbsp; Point being to let them have a little peek as to what&#039;s on the other side, so they will understand there&#039;s nothing to be afraid of.&nbsp; Have appropriate music, activities like painting and crafts.&nbsp; Kool-Ade.&nbsp; I feel, at times, that I&#039;ve been called to do such a thing.

				My favoritest times in my life have been spent on a beach, at night, rolling my balls off with my family of the heart. I have healed from soul death because of MDMA, and the unconditional loving acceptance of those that give a flying fuck about me.<br /><br />Those that are close to dying may not be able to make it to the gathering, so an alternate way of sharing the love, acceptance, grief, might be necessary. <br /><br />There is also a call to heal the healers, the caregivers, those that are left behind. <br /><br />Make with it, and you might just find me lurking, waving my glow sticks in the air like I just don&#039;t care.

				Electric kool-ade!&nbsp; <br /><br />Sheesh they are already dying, don&#039;t have to kill them, too.<br /><br />I like the healing-the-healer idea.&nbsp; Excellent idea; in fact, probably the way to start.

Living to tell the tale seems ultimate proof that someone did not die at all, no matter how close they have come.

				funny how psychoactives can show you death is nothing to be afraid from... even special... while in reality your physical brain/body stops working and you will experience the same as being KO (from ghb or something).. meaning NOTHING.<br /><br />Meanwhile, you can be burned... fun like a joint...<br /><br />OR:<br />eaten by bugs, they shit parts of you, other things pick it up etc. etc. REINCARNATION!

				I think we should be more clear on what dead, or nearly dead, actually does mean. <br /><br />In terms of drug-induced &#039;nearly dead&#039; complete narcosis as used in surgery is as close as it gets. When you are under full anesthesia to have surgical work done on you, you are complete unconscious. Pain medication suppresses you from waking up due to the pain of the actual surgery to some degree, but you would not wake up from other stimuli either: Loud equipment, operating lamps aimed straight at your face and such will not awaken you at this point. <br /><br />This point is, however, very very far away from death. If the doctors decided to cancel the surgery, stop administering IV narcotics and just walk away, you would wake up after a short while and be perfectly fine (assuming they have not started cutting into you yet). <br /><br />A step closer would be when you need a ventilator to survive, i.e. you cannot breath properly on your own anymore, though your circulation is otherwise intact. This condition would be fatal without the ventilator, but not unlike it would be fatal to be without water in the desert for a week: You will die from running out of oxygen, but apart from that are still very much alive. <br /><br />Death is mostly a thing of the brain: you are dead when your brain has suffered so much damage it can never recover from it. It is also a finite state - once you are actually dead you can by definition never revive, if you somehow managed to you have not been dead. <br /><br />Interestingly this also means that you can be dead, but still appear very much alive, just asleep. Some coma patients are actually dead, but can sustain their own breath even when their brain is damaged so badly they can never regain consciousness. On the exterior someone in this state could look much more alive than someone else that has sustained severe injury, needs to be on ventilators, have numerous resuscitation attempts and all. The defining factor is simply the outcome: if you live, you have never been dead in the first place, if you do not, you have died somewhere along the process, even if its not precisely known at which point the situation become irreversible.
