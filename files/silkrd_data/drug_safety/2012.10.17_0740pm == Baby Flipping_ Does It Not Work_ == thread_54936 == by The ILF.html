				Ok, no, not juggling infants in the air or anything.<br /><br />One of the members of the ILF has, on more than one occasion, been rolling on a good dose of an MD-compound and thought it would be cool to add a small dose of say, 30 mics of acid, half a gram of dried mushrooms, or a threshold amount of DMT, to tinge the experience with a more psychedelic flavour (a bit more humor, universal oneness, all that).&nbsp; The only thing is, it doesn&#039;t seem to work.&nbsp; The acid just seemed to make things more speedy -- for instance, he was getting turned on by wholesome mom types -- and the tryptamines seemed to make things more sluggish -- so, like, he wasn&#039;t turned on by anything.<br /><br />Anyone had similar experiences?&nbsp; He&#039;s had no trouble getting good trips out of standard doses of the aforementioned, but does he need to just go whole hog and take a regular dose of both the MDxx and the psychedelic to properly flip?&nbsp; Another member of the ILF advises this and has had wondrous times both hippie- and reality-flipping.

				i have never &quot;baby flipped&quot; however i have taken a full dose of mdma, and lsd at the same time, with a little bit of k. ..&nbsp; was quite the experience. i would recomend it, cause it was an awesome trip, but i honestly don&#039;t know the exact amount of k i took, it was at a festival in the middle of a crowd. i feel like taking such a small amount of lsd or another psychedelic would not really make that much of a difference, but i honestly don&#039;t know.

				Ah, k-bumps (off a key?) in the middle of a party.&nbsp; Mmm, yes!<br /><br />Good to hear you had an excellent time with the full-on candy flip.&nbsp; So yeah, that member of the ILF is thinking he should just get on with a whole dose for each half of the combo!

				Sounds like a lot of fun. What would be the effects of taking 30mg 2-cb and then an hour later railing about 30 to 50 mgs of ket? Then an hour later parachuting 200 mgs of molly and smoking weed the whole time?

I was a block away from the beach and my friend didn&#039;t know the area too well so I was having to tell him directions when I was having a hard time thinking in general. But after we got to the beach I saw the most beautiful sunset ever and couldn&#039;t even take my eyes away from it since I felt like it was the most beautiful thing I&#039;ll ever see.<br /><br />But yeah all my friends say that MDMA and LSD are an amazing combo. Also 25i and MDMA are a good combo too<br /><br />

				Digital Hippie you give out strange info for someone that says they have little experience. <br /><br />Also WTF is baby flipping? Do you mean candy flipping (MDMA+LSD)?<br /><br />Candy flipping is incredible if done correctly. The key in my opinion is not to take too much of either. Some of the most intensely enjoyable experiences in my life were on a single quality pressed and a tab of fluff.

				I&#039;m going to try candy flipping in a couple of weeks at a festival. Anyone have suggestions as to how much I should take??

My tolerance doesn&#039;t seem to change too much though. I&#039;m not super experienced with acid, so that&#039;s the part I was worried about. Bringing some K to chill me out... also because I love K. Is it good to let the acid drop for a while then take the mandy or let the mandy peak while I&#039;m just feeling the acid?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, from what I understand, you should do a bit of the molly, like .15, then do another .1-.2 and drop the L, about 90minutes after the initial .2.&nbsp; &nbsp;So basically, you piggy-back the bombs and drop the L to roughly follow the second peak, if that makes sense? after thaI always piggy-back molly, so thats just how I roll, otherwise I feel like I missed out on the second peak.&nbsp; Induction into the MDMA-space is something you want to mediate when you are going to drop L, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise I would say drop the L and do the bomb 20 minutes after, if you want the first peaks to coincide, because L takes longer than MDMA to kick in and peak, for me at least.&nbsp; Hope that helps.<br />GGG!
