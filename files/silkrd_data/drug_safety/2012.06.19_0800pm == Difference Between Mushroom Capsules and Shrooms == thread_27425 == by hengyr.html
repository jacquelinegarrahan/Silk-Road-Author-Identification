				Hey are there any noticeable subjective differences between ordering mushroom caps as they naturally are versus the shroom capsules? Does it take longer to kick in since the capsules take time to dissolve in stomach acid?

				There aren&#039;t any real noticeable differences, as far as I know. Capsules are usually taken by those who don&#039;t like the taste and nausea associated with eating the mushrooms.<br /><br />sdesu

				Onset is probably 20 minutes delayed depending on what kind of material the capsules are made out of.

				I used to love the taste of shrooms but now that I have eaten them way too many times, I put them in capsules.&nbsp; I don&#039;t notice any difference in the time frame to kick in (unless it is 5-10 min) or the intensity.&nbsp; It is much easier to ship capsules but the shelf life is a little diminished since you are increasing the surface volume.

				Capsules usually take around 45 minutes - an hour to hit me. If you want to cut down on that time, you can just dump the capsules into some boiling water and make tea. With that method you&#039;ll be feeling it in around 15-20 minutes, but the trip will be both shorter and more intense.<br /><br />If you are interested, here is a nice guide from a member who is sorely missed<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &quot;It is very easy to brew a small tea for your dose.&nbsp; Simply measure out 12oz of water into a small pot, bring to a light boil, toss in your capsules and simmer for 10-15 minutes.&nbsp; Then take your tea water and add it to your favorite mug with a tea bag, lemon and honey for taste.&nbsp; Allow this to steep for 15 minutes.&nbsp; Drink your tea.&nbsp; I personally consume the sclerotia solids at the bottom of the cup, though I don&#039;t think it is truly necessary.. but I&#039;m a waste not want not kind of person.&nbsp; Your choice at this point.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Consuming tea will change the trip.&nbsp; The onset will be within 30-45 minutes.&nbsp; The peak “climb” will happen very quickly and the peak will be higher.&nbsp; The duration of the trip will shorten with the Tea Method.&nbsp; Expect 4 -5 hours total with the tea method. &quot;
