				I know this is going to be abit vague and alot of variables come into play.<br /><br />But at music festivals, I&#039;ve never ever seem to have been able to last the entire day and into the night.<br />Usually the last 1 or 2 hours of the festival, I will begin to come down, and get a headache, and anything else I take just has no effect.<br />I assume my serotonin has depleted?<br /><br />Does anyone have any tips on make my roll last for longer.<br />I have tried delaying taking anything until late afternoon, but somehow still doesnt help. Or perhaps its just from being out in the sun and dancing around all day that causes it?<br /><br />And Yes I am drinking sufficient water throughout the day!

				Yeah, you simply can&#039;t roll on MDMA for that long - you run out of serotonin. In addition, any redosing you do just causes further harm (neurotically, worse come-downs). MDA lasts longer than MDMA and has similar effects (some people even prefer it), so you could switch to that, or combine the two. If you leave longer between rolls (up to two or three months), I expect they&#039;ll last longer and be stronger as well.<br /><br />Other than that, perhaps you could try mixing/switching to other drugs? Candyflipping is supposed to be very good (LSD + MDMA) and LSD lasts about 8-12 hours, and you wouldn&#039;t necessarily need/want any MDMA for the first 6-8 of those. In addition, taking 2c-b as the MDMA wears off is supposed to be an amazing combination, reducing the comedown and having better effects that 2c-b alone. Hopefully I&#039;m trying LSD-&gt;MDMA-&gt;2c-b this weekend, so I can let you know how it goes.<br /><br />Other than that, you may just have to find an alternative or live with it. Apparently AMT has some similar effects (but a few different effects as well) and lasts longer. 5- or 6-APB would be worth looking into, too.<br /><br />EDIT: forgot to add: dosing MDMA orally lasts longer than snorting it. The ideal dosing schedule seems to be your initial dose, then another 1/2(ish) that dose again about an hour or so later. Any more and you&#039;re causing more harm for less benefit, and really only getting the stimulant effects rather than the lovey-dovey-ness we all love about it.

				So I&#039;ll tell you, I kept a nice roll going on MDA for like 12 hour with the physical euphoria and probably another 6 hours with some visual craziness but it took a gram of MDA to hold onto that ride and to say I felt like shit for about 3 days after it would be a serious understatement.<br /><br />I agree with the above that you&#039;d be better off coming up with a cocktail to keep you high even if it&#039;s not all an MDMA high. Dropping some LSD, a few hours later taking some MDMA then an hour or two later bumping that MDMA or MDA followed by a good dose of 2CB or Moxy when the last X hit starts to trail would likely fit the bill. I&#039;d lean towards Moxy for the best synergy just because it has a nice electric buzzing feeling that trails the MDMA pretty nicely and a bit of a stim effect too which is a plus 12 hours in. Did this once and really didn&#039;t feel bad the next day which is a plus.<br /><br />Honestly though there&#039;s only so much fun a brain can handle for a day before it has to stop seeing it as being fun. Getting past 12 hours on a non-Meth high is going to be hard and a meth high isn&#039;t exactly the most fun at a festival with everyone on MDMA. Personally I would just Shroom or Cid in the start and end the night with a good roll if you didn&#039;t want to hurt the brain too much.
