				I thought I would give a little summary on my first k experience which was a couple nights ago. I started with taking a small bump around 6 pm. I had to eyeball since my scale is still in the mail so I&#039;m not really sure the weight. I was extremely relaxed at this point. Even though I got a little nervous thinking about trying k beforehand, when I actually took it I was I was perfectly calm willing to go down whatever road it took me.<br />About 20 minutes later I wasn&#039;t feeling a whole lot so I did another bump around the same size. Over the next 20 minutes I started to feel it. I was just laying on my bed listening to music with my eyes closed. It was a nice feeling. I felt comfortable enough that I decided to really explore, so I took one more line, about twice as big as the first 2. Within a couple minutes a felt it much more intensely, yet still very pleasant. Over the next hour or so I laid on the bed with my eyes closed. The best way I can describe it is like when you are half way asleep, kinda out of it and have a bunch of random thoughts. The cool thing was that I could go wherever my mind took me, I was totally in control. It seemed like I changed scenes every couple of seconds. Every scene different and very interesting. I was very happy the whole time, never anxious or scared. Every so often I would semi snap out of it, and a lot of times I would feel like it had been awhile yet the same song was still on. At certain times, I felt like I was on a water bed, and was sinking through it. It was lovely!<br />The only thing I didn&#039;t really like was the after effect. I felt pretty dizzy, was unable to focus, and felt semi drunk. It was probably about 2 hours before I felt I could drive safely. Next time I try it out I will likely do it later at night, so that when I come down I can just try to go to sleep. <br />Overall it was a very cool experience. At no point was it overwhelming. Once my scale comes in I will definitely give it another go. Since I felt so comfortable the first time I will definitely try to travel a little deeper. Oh yea, one last thing... I want to give reich a shout out. Great communication, fast shipping, and great product!<br />

				Read my topic: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4527<br /><br />My first K sessions were very good and mystical, but as I continued to use it regularly every weekend, I started to build up tolerance.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t had K since March, so I hope my next use will be like the first one.

				If I want to K-hole, I snort 250mg. Break it up into however many lines you feel like. Do them all over the course of 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />The LD50 from K is really high, like 400mg/kg. So basically you&#039;ll be fine. Just snort it up, lie down in a dark room, perhaps put some Moderat on.<br /><br />This is precisely what I shall be doing tomorrow when my 1g of crystal K arrives.
