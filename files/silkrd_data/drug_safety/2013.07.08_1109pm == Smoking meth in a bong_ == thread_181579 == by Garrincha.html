				The title says it all really : can you smoke crystal meth in a water bong, or does it have to be a proper meth pipe?

				You can also smoke it off tin foil.<br /><br /><br />If you must do it this way, don&#039;t get the flame too close to the bottom of the foil as the product may get so hot that is catches on fire.&nbsp; It will waste a lot of the product.

				Think i&#039;m gonna try an experiment with my bong! Empty the water out and remove the bowl, put meth through hole at the top, put a coin over this hole, and finally, heat the bottom of the (glass) bong and inhale the vapor! Does this sound feasible, turning a water bong into a meth pipe?<br />I&#039;ve seen a real meth pipe and they look like they&#039;d be good for smoking some other drugs too : opium, heroin, kratom etc. Smokeable drugs which shouldn&#039;t be burnt like you would with cannabis. BTW, should hash oil be burned, or melted like the drugs mentioned above?

				Hollow out an ordinary light bulb, you can do it quickly with a pair of pliers, practice makes perfect. This is MUCH better than tin foil as its so hard not to waste it because the meth continues to vape for longer than you think and in a pipe or light bulb you will see this and suck it up but on tin foil its hard to see and to suck it up, so get crackin with that light bulb but keep up a nice supply its so sad when every room in your house is dark because you keep forgetting to buy lights, but not forgetting to buy meth!

				I&#039;ve never been keen on chasing the dragon, having tried it with H. Think it takes practice to do it correctly, and not waste half the drug in question.<br />By remarkable coincidence, my light bulb went yesterday and it has already been hollowed out, ready for its new use. Perfect!<br />Is a meth pipe essentially the same as an opium pipe? Could you smoke opium (or heroin) in a meth pipe?

				yes -&nbsp; i have done it with water pipe- you get a vey long drawn hit that isnt very fufilling as compared to a pipe or foil hit.<br />Diet- pepsi on the other hand&nbsp; , the artificial sweetner in it , binds with some of those nasty iodine+ephedrine impuities and seems not to steal as much of your dope&nbsp; as straight water does. Also it give it a complimentary nice taste to the smoke.<br /><br />o yeah , and in a water bong the dope tries to run away from the heat&nbsp; and towards the cooler water&nbsp; quickly- more of a pain in the ass than it&#039;s really worth.<br />and dont be stupid like those freebasers who&nbsp; put ether or some solvent in their bong,good way to end up in a burn ward

				As far as the lightbulb method, is there a danger of the bulb cracking or shattering because of the intense heat applied to it?

				Cheers Jack, good man. ;)<br />Sounds like quite a delicate procedure, lol. Hope i&#039;ve got a strong enough bulb, don&#039;t know the wattage, will just be extra careful not to burn the glass.<br />How do meth-heads in the States do it, there are enough of them lol&nbsp; :o
