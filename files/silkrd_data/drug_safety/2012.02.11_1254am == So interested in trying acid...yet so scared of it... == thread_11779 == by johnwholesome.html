				So,<br /><br />what&#039;s a guy to do? I&#039;m really so curious about tripping. I would love to try it. But the thing is, I generally don&#039;t like drugs that make you lose control. I tend to get very paranoid, even with small amounts of coke. I go straight from not high to ultra-paranoid, is that a bad predisposition to be using acid?<br /><br />Way I see it, my biggest fear is that I&#039;d be so anxious that I&#039;d prolly set myself up for a bad trip just by being so afraid of having one.<br /><br />My drug of choice is MDMA, all cuddly and none-threatening. I smoke a spiffy now and then but not regularly, again with the not liking to be &quot;out of control&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m aware of the set and setting requirements, but I have recently moved to a new city, and pretty much don&#039;t know anyone here yet, so I have no opportunity to surround me with people that have some experience and could guide me through the first trip a bit.<br /><br />Acidheads whaddaya think? Should I just leap into it? Make my place all nice and comfy and just drop one and hope it will work out? I&#039;m really scared shitless of the possibility of not liking the way it goes, and that not liking becoming a really bad trip. From various experiments I know that I have real trouble with psychedelics and the whole &quot;just letting go and rolling with it&quot; thing. Not being able to &quot;snap out of it&quot; is a really terrible possibility to me. You know like, when you&#039;re rolling or stoned and some outside events require you to at least act sober you have some control and can force yourself into a more &quot;sober&quot; state of mind. From what I understand there&#039;s no chance of that with LSD.<br /><br />What to do, what to do?

				Thought about it, but just not sure if it will have the desired effects. Been scouring Erowid and while some say it worked for them others claim it made their tripping even worse...<br /><br />I presume that would be me if I did.<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m that bad with some drugs.

				Maybe it&#039;s just not the right time in your life to try LSD. Since you&#039;ve recently moved to a new place, and have no friends there yet, I could see you falling into a bad trip since you&#039;re kind of isolated right now.

				You could try 2C-B at like 15mg, it&#039;s like brain candy at that dose, not too heavy going and not as many dark places as mushrooms. It&#039;s a good way to get used to the tripping headspace too and it&#039;s lovely on the tail end of MDMA. <br />After that, try mushrooms at maybe 2g, then work the dose up to 4g. Acid is the only one of the three I haven&#039;t tried but most of my friends are experienced with acid and say that if you can use higher doses of mushrooms comfortably, then acid is no problem.

				Having done lots of both I would not recommend trying 2c-b before acid even for an experienced mdma user but that&#039;s just my two cents. I think you should wait a little while until you get some people you trust, everybody gets bad trips and for me, all it takes to snap me out of them is one of my friends reassuring me that things are going to be all right. Psilocybin always gave me the worst bad trips though interestingly, I&#039;d need to scarf down etizolam or whatever antipsychotics I&#039;d have laying around to feel better.

				I&#039;ve never had a bad trip on LSD, I&#039;ve had bad trips on shrooms though.&nbsp; Through many experiences with DMT, Shrooms, and LSD, during your trip, it is necessary to just &quot;go with the flow&quot;.&nbsp; Saying the word &quot;yes&quot;, can trigger positive feelings, emotions during your trip that will offer it more stability.&nbsp; Freaking out is of course normal, but freaking yourself out even more by telling yourself you&#039;re going insane or something of the latter, will make you freak out even more, telling yourself it&#039;s just acid, and that no one has died from it, and trying to have fun will put you in a better mindset.&nbsp; LSD is a lot easier on the mind than shrooms too.&nbsp; The first time I did LSD, I did shrooms and DMT many times before, and my first experience with it, I actually felt more sober than ever before.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s why it&#039;s called lucy / similar to the word &#039;lucid&#039;, I felt more lucid than I would have sober.&nbsp; The storm of the mind was calmed.&nbsp; From that point, LSD became my drug of choice.

				wow, thanks guys...seriously....really appreciate all that good advice.<br /><br />I think maybe now really isn&#039;t the time in my life to try something that can have such profound effects.<br /><br />Hopefully I&#039;ll meet a few good people here soon, then I&#039;ll think about it again....

				Yeah I&#039;d have to agree with everyone in this thread.&nbsp; Being comfortable in your environment and self is key to not having a bad trip.&nbsp; Having done acid and shrooms a couple of times each and never having a bad trip except almost once from acid and I&#039;d say it was caused by the environment/people around me (I was the only one tripping and there were a lot of people drinking/being obnoxious).<br /><br />A go with the flow attitude and just letting go is completely necessary to enjoy the trip fully.&nbsp; Not necessarily being &#039;out of control&#039; but just going with it.&nbsp; Doing it with friends you trust just makes the experience that much more enjoyable.&nbsp; Some of my best drug related memories are doing shrooms on a farm in complete isolation with a group of friends I had complete trust in.&nbsp; <br /><br />So to better answer your question if your comfortable with everything, paranoia shouldn&#039;t be an issue.&nbsp; You&#039;ll find yourself more exploring your mind and what seems like a different reality. If you have the slightest bit of doubt in your environment or who you&#039;ll be around then I would say don&#039;t try it.&nbsp; At least until you can find a setting and friends that will make it a blast.&nbsp; That&#039;s just my opinion anyway.

				I did one hit of a 100mic blotter a few months back for my first time. I was concerned too, because weed makes me stupid paranoid but one hit was not at all overwhelming. You should be able to control yourself while still definitely getting your feet wet.

				Acid is something I have yet to try as well. I&#039;ve tried Mushies and a few of the 2Cs, but I&#039;m waiting to attempt Acid.<br /><br />I think the best idea would be to start with other pychadelics, and at low doses. Maybe a gram of Mushies one month, up it to two a month later. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d suggest Acid/MDMA, as Acid lasts longer than MDMA. If you don&#039;t like the come-down of MDMA, you&#039;ll probably hate the fuck out of it if you&#039;re tripping balls.

				i consider myself to be a pretty experienced user. Acid is my favorite high, it gives you the best body high and visuals (of course if the quality is right and dosage.)&nbsp; I believe everyone should have a clean trip or two in thier lifetime but wait till your ready. It can really take you on a journey. Acid only changes your perception of things in real life.<br /><br />I love dose but i&#039;ve taken my break for almost ayear now. It takes a toll on you if your not careful and not spacing out your trips.

				I felt the same way as you before I tried acid. I was so worried about loosing control and all that stuff. but too be honest, when I finally did it, it was fucking fantastic. first time I did was at a concert. each guitar note felt like orgasmic colors flowing through every crevasse of my body. acid isn&#039;t something to be feared, but to be embraced. it can be magic. it will alter your perspective of life, and what it actually is that makes us &#039;alive&#039;. once lsd is embraced, everything becomes one - I know it&#039;s a cliche, but it&#039;s a cliche for a reason. <br /><br />if I were you, I would go ahead and buy some. save it for a special occasion. when you feel as if you&#039;re ready. you will be nervous as the magic dissolves within you, but you will quickly realize that these nerves were not necessary once the warmth begins to fill you. maybe you go to the beach with some friends, take it around twilight, and let the waves guide you through the odyssey that is you and have the star filled sky fill you with empathy.

How long does a trip last assuming a 150ug dose is taken for a first time user?<br /><br />2. When your under the effects of LSD if need-be can you pass as normal around other people should a situation arise where you might have to talk to someone?<br /><br />3. If the trip goes bad would a good dose of 40-50mg of Diazepam help abort the trip to a cretin extent?<br /><br />4. Also what are the best movies to watch when tripping in LSD? I the moment I am torn between Avatar/The Shining and Torn Legacy....But to be honest I may end up watching them all.<br /><br />5.Last but not least my whole point/reason for wanting to do LSD is to gain more insight into creativity. I want to think up new creative ideas and think more out-side of the box and see a different perspective of life<br /><br />Any advice and or experiences anyone might have would be appreciated<br /><br />kind regards<br /><br />SpeedCrunch<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m by no means an expert on the subject so take everything I have to say with a grain of salt but I will try my best<br /><br />1. It will be a slow onset that will take an hour or so and will plateau for about 5-6 hours.&nbsp; Then a comedown phase of about an hour or two, so you basically have to devote the night to it.<br /><br />2. You may be able to handle normal conversation during the onset and come down phase but I would say during plateau communicating normally with people would be largely out the window.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be on another plane and normal reality won&#039;t make much sense so talking to sober people in normal converstion is almost completely impossible.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; From my experience Diazepam will do no good, you will still be stuck tripping pretty hard.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like weed where that would decrease paranoia.&nbsp; I have heard that certain anti psychotics my bring you out of the trip though I cannot say for certain from personal experience.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Not real sure...when I tripped a few times the easier the story was to follow the better.&nbsp; The more visually stimulating the better.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think deep movies will be good because you&#039;ll most likely not be able to follow.&nbsp; I can see how Avatar may be good or the Shining.&nbsp; Anything with good cinematography should keep you engrossed.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been overly creative on acid.&nbsp; I tried to write while on acid but kept find myself wandering in my own head but not being able to put words on paper.&nbsp; But during the comedown and afterwards during reflection I can see how there could be a creativity spike.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps.&nbsp; All the best and good luck in the future!

I&#039;m really so curious about tripping. I would love to try it. But the thing is, I generally don&#039;t like drugs that make you lose control. I tend to get very paranoid, even with small amounts of coke. I go straight from not high to ultra-paranoid, is that a bad predisposition to be using acid?<br /><br />Way I see it, my biggest fear is that I&#039;d be so anxious that I&#039;d prolly set myself up for a bad trip just by being so afraid of having one.<br /><br />My drug of choice is MDMA, all cuddly and none-threatening. I smoke a spiffy now and then but not regularly, again with the not liking to be &quot;out of control&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m aware of the set and setting requirements, but I have recently moved to a new city, and pretty much don&#039;t know anyone here yet, so I have no opportunity to surround me with people that have some experience and could guide me through the first trip a bit.<br /><br />Acidheads whaddaya think? Should I just leap into it? Make my place all nice and comfy and just drop one and hope it will work out? I&#039;m really scared shitless of the possibility of not liking the way it goes, and that not liking becoming a really bad trip. From various experiments I know that I have real trouble with psychedelics and the whole &quot;just letting go and rolling with it&quot; thing. Not being able to &quot;snap out of it&quot; is a really terrible possibility to me. You know like, when you&#039;re rolling or stoned and some outside events require you to at least act sober you have some control and can force yourself into a more &quot;sober&quot; state of mind. From what I understand there&#039;s no chance of that with LSD.<br /><br />What to do, what to do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You may try our Zyprexa - Abort The Acid Trip!<br /><br />Go here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/16901<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Matrix<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol, sorry Matrix but Zyprexa is poison!&nbsp; I hold it up there with quentiapine (Seroquel) and chlorpromazine (Thorazine).&nbsp; Drink some fresh milk a&#039;la&nbsp; Albert Hoffman ;)&nbsp; Drink some tea, coffee, whatever your favorite drink may be!&nbsp; I have found that antipsychotics only make the trip worse and really mucks things up..&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as benzos.... High doses of Valium tend to send one into a drunken stupor.. high doses of Clonazepam tend to make one wake up with dead babies strung from the ceiling fans.. stick to organic, like something that contains natural theobromine.&nbsp; Buy a dark chocolate bar.. etc<br /><br />My personal favorite is to drink some Guyakai... this is Yerba Mate.. which contains &quot;naturally&quot; theobromine, caffine, and other cocoa alkaloids.&nbsp; Yerba Mate WORKS WONDERS PEOPLE!<br /><br />Give it a try before using poisonous antipsychotics!

				Johnwholesome, honestly it sounds like its not the best time of your life to be trying psychedelics but hey, i don&#039;t know you or your life. my advice is to wait till you feel more comfortable and have a good group of friends and more stability. i dont think dropping a tab by yourself is really a good idea, i would say do it with friends if your gonna do it and maybe have a sober person to talk to. and maybe think about doing shrooms first because you never really know how much acid your getting so it hard to dictate the dose. maybe try half a tab if you really want to do acid or a gram of dried shrooms. bare in mind a gram of good shrooms can be pretty intense. like i did a gram of dried shrooms of silk road it and was quite intense! but then ive had a gram of average quality stuff and that wasn&#039;t so intense. i say always start smaller because you can always do more but if you start big than theres no going back. first time you trip just have a mild one to get you comfortable with the feeling an then the next time you trip if you want to go higher then you are more experienced etc. I have found with psychedelics trust your intuition! what i mean is before i do a drug i always know whether it is a good idea or not and sometimes i ignore my feelings and go againt them. with pills or mdma it isn&#039;t a big deal because they make you feel good but with psychedelics is is extremely important to go with your initial feeling. for example one time i was at a commercial music festival and was sober and bored. i had some shroom caps on me and i asked myself whether it would be a good idea, i knew it wasn&#039;t but i took them anyway and didnt have the best trip and regretted it. i always know when its a good idea and when it isnt and i feel most people do to. sure there are some people who can take anything anytime but i am not one of those people and you dont sound like one either. it might also be a good idea to have a benzo on you to chill you out if shit goes pear shaped. some people think thats cheating and if your having a bad trip it indicates personal problems that need to be worked out. while this might be true the fact is if you arnt having a good time theres no reason why you shouldnt be able to stop it. the thing is just because acid is bringing out your problems doesnt mean they can be worked out while the person is having a bad trip. maybe if your with a psychologist trained in psychedelic therapy (fat chance) or with good friends that can talk you through it but sometimes it doesnt work itself out. im not trying to freak you or saying that this will happen just being realistic. ive been with people who have tripped out and but been able to work it out with friends but ive also been with people who have tripped out and not been able to work out whatever is going on and just had to ride out a horrible experience. for that reason i think its handy to carry a benzo of some sort in case your not having a good time/cant get into a good groove despite your best efforts. ive found candy flipping is amazing btw, i always take the acid and wait 4 to 6 hours till ive definately peaked and plateaued and then drop some mdma and its just a lovely end to the trip and mellows out any after trip scatness/uncomfortableness. some people dont get a comedown off psychs but i definately do and mdma is the perfect way to maek the transfer from no ego trippy fuckedness to sober. <br />all the best!

				I always felt like the worst trips were the ones that I learned the most, and gained the most strength, from. To me conquering the fear and learning to deal with the possibility of a trainwreck trip is what made psychedelics so great.

				The most important factors when taking LSD are set &amp; setting, if you have done a little research you might know that. Going into a trip with the thought that you have some stuff to abort (which usually doesn&#039;t help anyway) in case things are going the wrong way, is a prime example of a bad set and not recommended at all. If set &amp; setting are right and you don&#039;t suffer of any major psychological problem, there is nothing to worry about.

				I&#039;ve had good trips and only 1 bad one....my theory would be &quot;don&#039;t do it alone&quot;.. plan to be with someone the whole time cuz that always made it awesome for me.<br /><br />Also I saw a listing on SR that claims to stop a trip instantly and give you a mellow calm effect instead. It was a pill I believe. Maybe u should get one of those to keep on hand in case u freak out.<br /><br />If u have a good trip though,,,you&#039;ll love it in my opinion :-) <br /><br />Good luck!

				Tripping is fun, and can be serious if you&#039;ve taken a high enough dosage.&nbsp; I think a single tab would not be so bad.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never felt completely out of control, but I have found myself &quot;warping&quot; around.<br /><br />&nbsp; I once went to cross the street, looked both ways and crossed.&nbsp; Then a cop walked over and said, are you OK?&nbsp; I looked to the left and saw him standing next to the grill of a huge truck... I was standing in the middle of of the road and the cop had stopped about a foot to the left of me.&nbsp; I told him I was pretty drunk and just proceeded to cross the street.&nbsp; He left me alone, but I was paranoid for about an hour after that.<br /><br />If you do it alone, do it at home with maybe a few &quot;zones&quot; prepared.&nbsp; One place to entertain yourself, one to relax a bit with some calming music, and another with very little stimulation so you can gt introspective without distractions.&nbsp; Sometime music can propel you more than a film.<br /><br />I love movies on LSD though, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;d watch a horror movie like the shining.&nbsp; Sure some of it is trippy, like all the steadicam work they did in it, but it&#039;s pretty scary in some parts.&nbsp; I like to go to theatres and watch it on the big screen.&nbsp; Here they have &quot;midnight screenings&quot; every once in awhile.&nbsp; I saw The Wall a couple years back this way, and it was pretty awesome.&nbsp; Independence day was pretty good too... so much so I couldn&#039;t understand why some people didn&#039;t like it until I watched it again years later.&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />The key is your frame of mind.&nbsp; If you have a lot of self doubt and anxiety, it will come out in the trip.&nbsp; Get yourself into a good frame of mind, and be confident in yourself that you will have a good trip, and you will.

				I think to try something mind-altering, you have to be either in a good space, so you can handle it, or so totally<br />f*cked up things cant get worse, it sound like you are not in either.&nbsp; So I probably wouldnt try it, definitely dont try by yourself, for this you need a safety belt, either someone experienced or not taking.&nbsp; And remember if things go bad - get help.&nbsp; Doctors never take users to the police, and even the police if someone has already taken and iff not violent will try to help and generally wont charge you unless you still are in posession (so leave stash at home or throw away).<br /><br />You probably shouldn&#039;t take it if you really are f*cked up, it will make things worse.<br /><br />Smoke ice, it is good for you.

				i always heard that orange juice will intensify the trip, while a base like milk will calm you down.&nbsp; i used to blend fresh psilcibin with OJ to ingest them more easily.&nbsp; i have also made tea from psilocybin and doing it that way oppose to eating them is less of a gradual build up... with the tea it hits you all at once. <br /><br />would definitely get some Zyprexa or at least a few mg of Xanax or something just incase the trip goes bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it...

				I&#039;m planning on taking my first trip this weekend.&nbsp; I&#039;m the paranoid/unwanted thoughts-type when I smoke weed, so I&#039;m a little apprehensive, but at the same time I&#039;ve been wanting to do this for so long.&nbsp; I will be tripping with another friend who will also be losing his acid-virginity, along with my girlfriend who will stay sober, but has never tripped herself.<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;m in a good mindset aside from my paranoia, I&#039;m happy, very comfortable with my girlfriend, I have a reasonably quiet apartment, and a nice sound system.&nbsp; My friend and I don&#039;t intend to do much beyond sitting, thinking, and listening to music.&nbsp; But I&#039;m still paranoid about being paranoid.&nbsp; Mostly paranoid about &quot;losing control&quot; or doing potentially dangerous or destructive things I don&#039;t intend to do, which I&#039;m reasonably sure doesn&#039;t happen with LSD but I just need some reassurance.&nbsp; Is having a generally high paranoia alone enough to reconsider tripping?&nbsp; How can I relax myself before I take it?&nbsp; Any other advice not already mentioned in this thread?<br /><br />I do have access to klonopin, how much should I have ready just in case?&nbsp; I know just having it around will make me feel better about tripping.<br /><br />Also I&#039;m on lamictal for seizures.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s also used as a mood stabilizer so I feel like it could potentially interact...does anyone know if lamictal affects the trip any?

				blockrockinbeats- yeah it&#039;s an urban myth. <br /><br />nativebelle- sounds like you shouldn&#039;t be tripping yet, negative thoughts can get amplified hugely on hallucinogens resulting in an all out bad trip. You absolutely must be positive, happy and calm before taking any hallucinogen even if it means spending a week preparing yourself mentally. Is this your first time tripping on any drug?<br /><br />Also, you may disagree but it might not be a brilliant idea having a sober, non tripping girlfriend around, particularly if she&#039;s never done any hallucinogens before. She may be a little apprehensive if she&#039;s with 2 hallucinating people even if she doesn&#039;t outwardly show it and she&#039;ll be concerned that you&#039;re feeling okay throughout the duration of the trip. Hallucinogens make you ultra sensitive to other peoples emotions and you&#039;ll pick up on any anxiety or apprehension she may have, which could feed into your emotions and cause you to start to feel negative or anxious. From my own experiences, the worst thing in the world is to have someone continually fussing over you and asking if you&#039;re okay when you&#039;re tripping.

				definitely what wowzer said. Having someone who isn&#039;t accustomed to hallucinogens worrying the whole time is recipe for disaster. It&#039;s cliche,but it can&#039;t be stressed enough, SET and SETTING. Be in a good place mentally. This isn&#039;t everyone, and if it&#039;s not you, WAIT. Hallucinogens are beautiful substances but they aren&#039;t for everyone at every time. If you&#039;ve got a ton of shit on your mind that is bad, stressful, scary, I wouldn&#039;t trip. The other part of the equation is be in a comfortable place that you know. Do it in your room, or a friend&#039;s basement, somewhere you feel totally comfortable. Later, after a few trips, you can explore.

				Sorry if I implied that I&#039;m in a &quot;negative&quot; place right now, I&#039;m really not.&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy with life, I&#039;m generally a calm person, and it takes a lot to stress me out.&nbsp; I consider my setting now to be &quot;very comfortable.&quot; I&#039;m excited about trying this.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that I&#039;m paranoid while high (isn&#039;t everyone though?) so obviously there&#039;s that little thought in the back of my mind that I could become so overwhelmingly paranoid that I panic-attack and have a bad trip or do something stupid.&nbsp; This something everyone has in the back of their mind or is that just me?<br /><br />I&#039;ve done salvia a few times before, I think it&#039;s fun for the 5 minutes that it lasts.&nbsp; The first time was in my dorm room in college several years ago.&nbsp; Once I got past the &quot;what is this new feeling&quot; feeling, gravity suddenly became so hilariously strong that I had to crawl on the floor back to my chair 3 feet away, laughing my ass off.&nbsp; Then I hugged my tower fan, telling everyone else that &quot;I just love what it&#039;s doing to the air.&quot;&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t even on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Next time, same place, except my roommate&#039;s desk started stretching backwards into a tunnel and it was trying to suck me in.&nbsp; But not like a scary sucking-in, I was just laughing my ass off as I was holding onto my chair for dear life.<br /><br />Most recent time was in my old apartment.&nbsp; I hit it and then immediately felt like I was being comfortably squished between two cushions shaped like egg-cartons.<br /><br />All three times my mind sketched out for just a second, wondering where it was gonna go, but that anxiety went away very quickly.<br /><br />So no, the one hallucinogen I&#039;ve done didn&#039;t make me freak out.&nbsp; But then again, it&#039;s salvia...barely even counts?&nbsp; 5 minutes is a lot shorter than 6+ hours.<br /><br />I just moved a few months ago and all my friends that have tripped before are all very far away from me.&nbsp; I know the best thing to do is have a sober sitter who has had experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably not a good idea to do this with no sitter, at least not for our first time.&nbsp; My girlfriend has read the Leary and Huxley books, she finds it interesting.&nbsp; She&#039;s very curious to watch us.&nbsp; She just doesn&#039;t want to try it herself.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think she&#039;s nervous about it now, but you&#039;re right, maybe she will be once we actually do it.&nbsp; Is it ultimately better to wait til we have an experienced sitter?&nbsp; That&#039;ll probably be a while unfortunately.<br /><br />ALSO LAMICTAL + LSD = WHAT HAPPENS?

				<br />Here is how I feel about the first times: <br /><br />-I think that LSD is a very strong drug that you &quot;learn&quot; how to deal with every time until you feel totally comfortable with it. I have done it three or four times and it has been always different and pretty much a huge trip/adventure. Yes I have had bad trips, but I think this constitutes part of the trip, and as someone said before in this thread, that is how you learn and grow stronger. It&#039;s is like life.<br /><br />I have done shrooms another three times and felt it was a very smilar trip, maybe more mild and closer to &quot;reality&quot; but still intense. <br /><br />- In a way it&#039;s is kinda all about letting go, loosing control (mentally, it&#039;s not that you loose control of your body), giving in and even losing your ego through a bad phase of the trip, to then be born again much stronger. So if you are paranoid and have thoughts that overwhelm you with weed, that WILL happen with LSD. <br /><br />-Having a sober person by your side. Well, when I have tripped with both LSD and shrooms I could NOT be around, not even close to, not even ten feet away from, sober people AT ALL. I would laugh, stare at them, avoid them like a maniac... I could not communicate at all with a &quot;normal&quot; person. I could only relate those that were with me on the ride.<br /><br />BUT: Having a sober person by your side is THE BEST thing when you have a bad trip. Just whispering, saying everything will be ok, that it is only temporary, that you took a drug and it&#039;s effect will pass, that you will be happy tomorrow.. Telling you to enjoy the moment, this wonderful world this drug takes you to, the good things you can get from it.. <br /><br />It helps if this person knows the drug and how it works. But if the person is committed to help, listen, is immensely patient and has a taking care of/mother/babysitting instinct, with no judgements (wont tell you what mistake you made for taking LSD and that kinda stuff), it will be wonderful. If you trust your girlfriend 100% it can be good to have her around. <br /><br />-This is why the idea of set and setting is repeated over and over. Have a positive mindset, tell yourself this is for fun and introspection, nothing bad will happen and all that. And remind yourself or have someone remind you of this during the trip if any thoughts, anxieties appear. Think about the wonderful things people say and write about LSD. This is why you have to give in, loose control and get rid of any fears you may have. I personally would take anything to stop the trip. Having some bad moments IS part of the trip, you will learn how to deal with it better the next time, or the next minute, hour... <br /><br />As someone said, it is like a rollercoaster. If you go with fear, hidding your head, wishing it to be over as soon as possible.. you will have a bad trip and will not enjoy the ride. If you keep your eyes open to what is going on, scream, and open your arms when the train is dropping at more than 80 miles an hour, you will have the trip of your life. <br /><br />And setting. Make sure you have anything you might want to need like cigarettes if you smoke, water, anything you might feel a terrible need for. And make sure no mailman, grandma, cop, neighbor is gonna knock on your door. That is why people go to the woods or the beach to take LSD or shrooms.. It is all about where, how, with whom... for what... <br /><br />-I wouldn&#039;t worry about any movies, especially terror movies, are you crazy? Why would you want to see that on your first trip? Killings, blood and a family trapped in an empty hotel with their father trying to kill them with an ax??? And you want to avoid a bad trip??? hahahah!!!! LOL! Think about your favorite music, electronica, house/trance... anything you love and that you feel touches your soul. <br /><br />-I am preparing myself for a new LSD trip (last one was in august 2010). And I am reading tons about it (I wish I had before all my trips in the past), also about ayahuasca, which I also intend to do at some point. I just read &quot;LSD my problem child&quot; by Albert Hoffman and watched a couple of documentaries like &quot;Inside LSD&quot; and &quot;LSD Problem child and wonder drug&quot;. Also &quot;Food of the Gods&quot; by Mckenna. Of course Huxley and Leary are all wonderful reads.<br /><br />-It is a very spiritual drug and it will open you and take you where it wants.. so you wanna be in the best possible environment for the first times... People take it in huge festivals and stay right in front of the dj enjoying every note of the music.. experience, intentions, mindframe... it all counts. Everyone reacts differently to LSD.<br /><br />-It can last anything from six to twelve hours with very different phases. And the interaction with lamictal... Doesn&#039;t sound very appropiate. I am no doctor, but from what I read on wikipedia.. I would not mix them. I think it says it stays in the body uo to 36 hours.. Can you do without taking it for a couple of days?? Or, hey, ask your doctor, he will know. <br /><br />-I wouldn&#039;t take e or anything the very first time. Enjoy this unique substance on its own. <br /><br />Hope it helps&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

				Helps a lot, thanks for typing that all out man!<br /><br />I have not taken my lamictal for the past two days, and from what I gather via google, the &quot;worst&quot; that can happen if they interact is &quot;nothing.&quot;&nbsp; As in &quot;just wasted my dose&quot; nothing.&nbsp; We will see though, totally willing to give it a go.&nbsp; Will update on how it goes!
