				PureO Tonic.<br />This is a Cold water extraction recipe that will allow you to remove nearly all the acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol, or APAP)from Percocet.<br /><br />There are many CWE (cold water extraction) recipes out there but we’ve been given the best by our customers and successfully tested it out to find which was best. Some recipes on the internet claim they can remove 95-99% of Tylenol and leave nearly pure Oxycodone within a 2-4 hour timeframe. It cannot be done in less than 3-4 days!<br /><br />What you are going to need to start:<br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 Percocet, Codeine, or Vicodin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coffee filters and someone to hold them in place<br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 2- 2 liter bottles of water<br />4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 containers to hold the fluid like an water/ice tea pitcher.<br />5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpine Apple Cider Mix in those envelopes or Crystal Light Lemonade<br />6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A refrigerator, the mixture needs to sit in the fridge during the 72-96 hour process. <br />7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience approx. 3-4 days worth<br /><br /><br />Step 1: Crush, smash, or place 20-25 Percocet in blender for 2 seconds.&nbsp; DO NOT blend then to fine powered<br /><br />Step 2: Mix that with 1.5-2 liters of warm water (NOT BOILING WATER*).<br />&nbsp;*If you put boiling water in the mixture it worthless. Toss it, heat is does bad things to Oxycodone. <br />Make sure the water is the temperature of the hot water in about warm as water from your faucet, not hot enough to scold you.<br />Step 3: Chill that mixture in the fridge for at least 24-30 hours. Do not shake that mix, let the white stuff fall to the bottom and separate during this period.<br />**Notice the crap on the bottom of the pitcher<br />Step 4: Pour that mixture into a water pitcher, making sure you aren’t pouring the whitish substance on the bottom. You will see some chalky white stuff on the bottom of the container. Some people offering 4 hour recipes believe this is the acetaminophen (Paracetamol, Tylenol, or APAP)- it isn’t! That is corn starch used to bind tablets.&nbsp; The cloudy stuff on top of that chalky stuff is the Tylenol and you need to make sure you don’t transfer that into the next pitcher when you are pouring it into another container- toss it.<br />Step 5: After you poured the clearer stuff on the top into a new water pitcher stir in 1 or 2 tablespoons of Alpine Cider Mix or 1 Teaspoon of Lemon Crystal Light.&nbsp; Those two acidic drinks have large amount of Soda Ash and Lime to clarify their drink mixes.&nbsp; It will cause the remaining acetaminophen to bind up and fall down to the bottom of the pitcher. <br />Step 6: Put it back in the fridge and wait 24-36 hours again for the substance to self filter.<br />Step 7:&nbsp; Move the mixture to a new picture.&nbsp; It should be clear enough to see through, and be slightly tinted. Again toss the cloudy stuff on the bottom out.<br />Step 8: If you made sure to follow the first 7 steps carefully, you won’t need to filter anything because it should be clear and filtered itself during the unbinding process. Just to be safe, run that mix through a coffee filter.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />After trying this a few times move on to your Cold Water Extraction Ph.D.- which is slightly heating that mixture for 12-24 hours until you’ve condense most of the water out.<br /><br />This step should not be handled by novices as you are gambling with a lot time and finished product.<br /><br />Step 8 (the Ph.D.) if you feel that you are indeed mastered this, then and only then try your hand at extracting water from the mixture and making a powerful tonic that fits nicely into a flask or shotglass.&nbsp; What is very important to remember here is heat does bad things to oxycodone and can make the mixture less potent or brownish if done incorrectly. <br /><br />Carefully place the finished batch into a pot (like a spaghetti pot) and genteelly heat.&nbsp; NEVER BRING TO A BOIL OR SIMMER. Gas stoves are notoriously bad from this, a crock pot or rice cooker with a “keep warm” option is idea.&nbsp; Electric stoves work also well too, but make sure that the fluid always remains warm or hot to the touch but no heat bubbles form in the pan.&nbsp; Over the next 12-24 hour period you should be able to reduce the amount of water by ½ to ¼, or even 1/8 of the original batch. This is some potent stuff so be very careful about chugging or gulping the entire mixture as each time you swallow can be equivalent to taking a 20 or 40 mg oxycodone tablet (depending how many Percocet you started the process with.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to cut the recipe in half if you want to experiment with 10 tablets and 1 liter of water. <br /><br />Have fun. Be Safe.<br /><br />PureO<br /><br />******Now’s the time for the Commercial*****<br />At PureO we offer an unlimited supply of Percocet on the net. Our supply and distribution channels originates and shipped from a lawful modern countries where there counterfeit meds are severely punished and all but non-existent. The expiration dates are at least 3-4 years. More importantly, at all times medications are kept and stored in a cool dry place, which is important for oxycodone as heat, humidity, and bright light can weaken or render oxycodone harmful.
