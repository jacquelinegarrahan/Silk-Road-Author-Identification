				so SR has turned me on to the exciting world of MDMA. I am thrilled with the product that the Tesseract puts out, and my world has changed. Seems to me that his MDMA is quality.<br /><br />I know myself, and there is potential for abuse. I&#039;d like to get a good understanding of what sort damage I may be doing to my body. I started with and will continue to do small doses. I&#039;m talking 100mg each time with no booster. I take a bunch of vitamin C, magnesium and HTP-5 just before and after the roll. Seems like the next day I get pooped, but otherwise all is well.<br /><br />I wanted to stick to once a month, but here I am having just rolled last week and new years is coming up fast. Will I be a wreck if I roll two or three times in a month? How often do you roll? Do you pre/post load? What&#039;s the routine?<br /><br />Thanks for any advice on this. I want to make the most of this new discovery, but the last thing I need is a depression or other drug-induced condition!

				You should wait AT LEAST a month between rolls.

				I take Piracetam every day, you don&#039;t have to take it everyday, but worth thinking about the day after a roll. Feed the brain with some blood.<br /><br />Think about your diet as well, if you are taking drugs regularly. Maximize your health in other areas, exercise and get plenty of good quality sleep.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to go overboard, but you would be amazed at the different good structured diet and exercise can do for your drug taking.<br /><br />If my great grand parents didn&#039;t think of it as food, then I probably shouldn&#039;t eat it. <br /><br />Rest up, and leave reasonable gaps between heavy rolls.&nbsp; You can dose MDMA lower to remove social anxiety, in these cases shorter spaces between doses is acceptable.

				Just wondering if any of you have body weight dosage recommendations. I&#039;ve seen 1.5mg/kg (+16% for 84% purity) but that seems pretty low - my 48kg (105lb) partner would only be taking ~84mg. And I (at 190lbs) would be taking ~150mg. I was already planning on 150mg for myself since I haven&#039;t tried this MDMA before (CF&#039;s tan powder), but am interested in a good dosage for my partner as this is her first time and she is somewhat sensitive to psychedelics. I want it to be manageable, but also worth her time (i.e. not too mild). I was originally planning on around 120mg, but am not sure. What do you all think?

				I don&#039;t roll anymore unless I have 5-HTP on hand for the morning after. As a seratonin precursor it really is fundamental for making the following day a bit more bearable.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94218.msg889790#msg889790">Quote from: jackxblack on March 07, 2013, 04:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just wondering if any of you have body weight dosage recommendations.

You can always redose later.
