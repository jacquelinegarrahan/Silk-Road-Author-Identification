				Hi all<br />I cannot find this method anywhere (or have not been seaching enough) but the first and only time I tried white H it was with a guy from pakistan, he took a small bottle of water,take off the &quot;stopper&quot;(the thing u unscrew sry for my english)<br />replace it with foil done some pinhole in it and made a hole in the bottle to inhale.Then we light up some cigs, he put the hashes on the top of the bottle and then the white H he light it up , the H turn into a liquid and was smokable cause it melted into the hashes, it was the best high of my life I was feeling great.I ve done the same with brown H once,the bum way on a K cider can same thing pinhole in it hashes and H but it was definatly not the same high it was street and dogy brown.<br />So I want to get some #4 is this what I got from my paki friend ll I be able to do that?and why are people smoking on foil and dont use this method cause it s pretty hard not to waste u re H when u re a casual user?<br />thanks SR fella ;)

				Hello.<br /><br />You can do this way - it is not very common except in the countries where it&#039;s cheaper than water because its a waste. The way that you smoked it is the same way many, myself included, smokes crack.<br /><br />But yes you should be able to do that - MindGuru on SR sells #4 which I both snorted and smoked - I sprinkle it on the weed before rolling up my joint or I moist the outside of a ciggie and roll it and then heat it up.. its a waste but you don&#039;t need many puffs before you&#039;re nodding - if you have MindGuru&#039;s stuff/your friends stuff or if youre lucky and happens to be in SE ASIA where you can get insane china white.<br /><br />The reason why people smokes on foil is because it doesn&#039;t burn the product straight away which is a waste and afaik #3 is what goes hand in hand with foil.<br /><br />Cheers!
