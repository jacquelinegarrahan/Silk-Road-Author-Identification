				After some researching today it seems this is the kind of scale you need - especially considering I&#039;m using low milligram dose drugs as opposed to MDMA etc.<br /><br />I have a rubbish scale that I bought recently. I find that it&#039;s very easy to waste fine powder such as 2CB - it sticks to your fingers, the inside of tablet containers etc. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll have a hard time pouring the weighed amount off the surface of the scale without wasting it.<br /><br />Any ideas?

				Ahh this can be tricky.<br /><br />The best method I find is to use index cards and simply pour the powder from one card to another. <br /><br />You can also use small spoons or the cap of a bic pen as a spatula in order to transfer the powder between containers without actually touching the product.

				I generally eyeball everything.<br /><br />25i, 2c-p, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just kidding.<br /><br />I&#039;m lame, have no bad ass scale, so when I dose out my moon dust, I initially weigh it on a normal scale to see if it&#039;s &quot;roughly there&quot;.&nbsp; I put it on a shiny piece of paper, the kind with a&nbsp; smooth surface.&nbsp; once I know I have a semi accurate amount, and trust in the dealer, I distribute it into capsules, tamping them all down until they are pretty much even.<br /><br />Now, this is a stupid tek, but mdma is rather lenient on dose variations.&nbsp; Nobody will die.<br /><br />But, my idea for when I get into the truly powerful shit is to use liquid gelcaps.&nbsp; either buy new ones, or empty out prefilled ones and seal the injection site.&nbsp; I&#039;m still trying to figure out how to seal the injection site on store bought and filled liquid gel capsules.<br /><br />Much testing will have to be done on this subject.

				a few of my friends and i actually dissolved some xanax in everclear (95 percent EtOH) and then just put them in regular clear gelatin capsules<br /><br />they held up surprisingly well, some leaked a bit but were able to be stored for at least a few weeks.. then id just put my bud in the bags to soak up whatever leaked. i wouldnt recommend it though really<br /><br />i dont really remember that summer. lol except that it was awesome<br /><br />if you are measuring doses to take orally, as mentioned just measure weight of capsule then directly fill from initial container with a small scoop to correct weight.&nbsp; use small slick surfaced folded paper weighing dishes and i like to use a cut straw actually to scoop. if you want to snort you can just pop open the cap and pour out the desired amount or just snort the whole capsule directly <br /><br />for storage, the most important thing is airtight and in the dark to prevent degradation. some things are sensitive to moisture and should be kept dry (especially lsd). the cooler the better generally, but room temp is usually sufficient cause fridges and freezes cause moisture build-up. many dont like plastic baggies cause they can split and arent as airtight or things stick, and recommend small glass vials. i like using opaque capsules then just fill a normal vitamin bottle (of same appearance or no description) with em so you cant even till its not the vitamin (as long as no one else has access thinking they are actually whats on the label)
