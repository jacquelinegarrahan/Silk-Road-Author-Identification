				In my area, synthetic pot and bath salts were huge.&nbsp; All these bible-belt thumping idiots and narrow minded people put pressure on politicians to write new state and local laws prohibiting synthetic drugs.&nbsp; These laws are written loosely and I feel this will lead to the eventual abuse of these new laws.&nbsp; It is sad people even smoke that shit when weed grows so easily and is so abundant.&nbsp; The whole war on drugs is....well...I don&#039;t need to tell you;)<br /><br />They shut down like a bunch of head shops in a bordering town.&nbsp; It is just so sad.&nbsp; It is cat and mouse and they are loosing.&nbsp; All the while, some tweak-er is making meth in his car in McDonald&#039;s parking lot.<br /><br />Saddest part is that the real problem is the big elephant in the room. Oxycodone and oxymorphone. Both are everywhere.&nbsp; People are hooked at some of the highest rates when compared to anywhere else in the U.S.&nbsp; If they want to go after somebody, go after the big pharmaceutical companies that manufacture more and more pain medicine every year.&nbsp; Could you imagine what restricting manufacturing and distribution would do to the blackmarket price of oxycodone?&nbsp; It would only make heroin more prevalent, which BTW is impossible to get locally.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hate to even see. We are all hooked!&nbsp; And if you have never been hooked, you will either be recovering or becoming addicted sometime soon, I promise.<br /><br />PS: DONT DO PAIN PILLS<br />

				Literally only solution is to make them all legal. Needing a prescription to buy drugs is total bullshit in my opinion. The problem isn&#039;t that people are doing drugs, but that it&#039;s illegal for people to do drugs.
