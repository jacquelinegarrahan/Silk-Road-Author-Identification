				I see the 80 mg listed for around $45 to $50 USD per pill.<br />I remember when I used to get the 60mg pills for 2$ or $3 a piece and i had a hard time finding ppl to sell them to&nbsp; beca theyre not crushable or anything so i stopped getting them.<br />did ppl find a way to crush them yet or are they just way overpriced?

				yeah...people have found ways to crush them and use them in various ways, however i still don&#039;t find they are nearly as good as the old formula, and I could never ever ever bring myself to pay 50 bucks for an op80.&nbsp; I just think that&#039;s ridiculous.

				how do you crush them, do you know? I can probably still get them for a buck or two apiece and would love to get fucked up for a week for under 10 dollars lol<br />or who knows maybe ill sell them on SR for 20 bucks a pop and make a killing :)

				do a search on bluelight.ru...there&#039;s a few different methods posted on there...<br />I&#039;ve heard of people using a dremel type tool to grind them into a fine powder...a cheaper alternative is something called &quot;pedi-paws&quot; which i think is supposed to be a dremel type tool for clipping pet tonails.&nbsp; <br />i&#039;ve gotten them pretty powdery using a hoseclamp or an emory board, but it takes forever and starts hurting your fingers after a while...

				almost sounds like its not worth it..<br />I think i&#039;d rather just pay the extra 6 bucks and buy roxie 30&#039;s for like 8 or 10 bucks. problem is i go thru them so fast :(

				Their easy to crush and sniff like the originals...Even shoot...U can bypass or destroy is a better word the gel cap thats pretty much inside it ...When u cruch it gels out as u know..<br /><br />But if u lightly take a wetnap or wet your t shirt and wipe the green coating off, then take something like one of those Peg things i forget the name, i think people use them on their feet to get off dead skin or calasis, or&nbsp; dremal tool, or anything that can grind the pill into powder over a ceramic plate take the plate then put it in the oven, watch it the whole time, And the white powder will turn lightly golden then take it out ASAP and then put it in the freezer too cool it off and harden the powder up..Leave in about 5 to 8min take out..<br /><br />then take your razor blade or card whatever scrape it into a pile and snort it or u can shoot it..<br /><br />Iv done this perssonally several times and also u can watch vids of peoples doing the process on Youtube..<br /><br />Some people use a Microwave, but to me a oven works faster if u set it at 400 throw it in and in 3 min its ready but u HAVE TO WATCH, U CANT LET IT BURN!!..<br /><br />I wouldnt pay 45bucks for them though.. I have a friend that gives me 10 off and on.. <br /><br />Also once a mnth i get the Original Oc 30mg;s sent to me from a friend in AUSTRAILA where there still made, just by a nother company but everything still the same and purdue knows and sold the rights to the compy , they only stopped the original formula in the states..<br /><br />But the the&nbsp; OP 2bucks for a original OC&gt;??? MY GOD MAN!!! back in 2000 til 2007 when i quit doing them hardcore i started out paying 20 a 80mg, then went up to 50, some times 60 tword the end..<br /><br />The best thing now bar far Is fentynal Pure Powder.. Its better than Heroin or anything.. Iv done Opiates 13 almost 14 years, i started out with Oc&#039;s so iv always had a high tolerance, I use to go through 25 4mg dilaudids a day at one time..I tried some fent powder from dutchguy he&#039;s from netherlands but now has ppl in the USA selling it for him also, If your just a weeknd warrrior dont even test those waters it will drop u dead.<br /><br />i got a 10mg sample first, and i did a tiny key bump and injected it, it put me on my ass i hadnt been that fucked up since the first time i did a OC 80mg... <br /><br />Only thing is fentynal your tolerance jumps fast, so u only get that great rush the one time or 3 from a bag imop ... But its great.. Fentynal lolipops are great too, i found a clear net site from inside the usa sells for 85 a pop 1600mcg, in case u dont know MCG-MICRO MILI GRAMS..

				Well where I&#039;m from I get them in botttles of 100 (or 180) pills for between $8 to $12 a piece. Usually i find someone who will take them all for 14 apiece and thats an easy $200 to $600 in my pocket with 20 mins of work :)

				Yea ive thought about it but I&#039;m really nervous about the whole bitcoins process and how to cash them out. Plus i dont want to have to buy a vaccum sealer (do they have dogs for roxi&#039;s anyways?)<br />I only get this hookup the 8th of every month when the doctor fills her script and she needs that cash so she can buy crack. It&#039;s hard to be a vendor but maybe next time i sell those blues ill invest the 500 dollars in a vendors account. Once I have a vendors account, I&#039;ll beat everyones prices and sell out quick :)

				I don&#039;t think dogs are trained to smell roxies but it&#039;s really probable. Vacuuming would still be a wise move, especially if you plan on selling internationally. I really hope you can become a vendor and if you do, save some roxies for me ;)<br />You&#039;d me the man if you sold oxy at those prices, even though you&#039;d still have a pretty big margin especially for the OPs.

				If a vendor came onto SR with roxies for 25 bucks, they would disappear so fast it would be ridiculous.
