				As long as you sleep the normal amount of time, you wll dream - regardless if you recall the dreams or not.<br /><br />5-htp can have some effects comparable;e&nbsp; to ssri&#039;s, in some people it some state of mind.&nbsp; It is by no means comparable to taking ssri&#039;s though.<br /><br />The most important thing is not to combine them though. Taking 5-htp and ssri&#039;s could result into a very serious medical condition mostly known as serotonin syndrome. Worst case the outcome of that is fatal, though i rarely is when proper medical care is at hand.

				I&#039;m going to second Ben&#039;s advice about not taking 5htp while simultaneously on an ssri. I was on about 75 mg of Zoloft for severe depression and anxiety. I was so desperate to feel better (and dumb) that I tried to add a low dose of 5htp (50mg) and experienced very worrisome physical and psychological effects about 3 days in and a massive anxiety attack. I will never do that again.<br /><br />But on it&#039;s own, it&#039;s fine and works pretty well. I would take 50- 100 mg for a mood lift and relaxation. Also, as said before taking it for a few days after a roll may help alleviate your post-roll blues.<br /><br />And you will begin to get some crazy dreams, so watch out for that :)

				I absolutely swear by 5-htp to ease a comedown. I dont know if its helped me pre loading, hard to judge how your roll would of been without it. But after a roll 100mg with a meal and 100mg before bed for a few days absolutely kills any depression the following week. I exercise 5 days a week which probably helps me more than the 5htp but the 5htp deffo gives me that extra perk i need the few days after.

				Yeah, pretty much what everyone has said is true.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY listen to people when they tell you to not do 5-HTP when you&#039;re rolling, to extend a roll, or immediately before your roll. You&#039;re already going to have enough serotonin in the synapse and the 5-HTP is only going to do you harm. I&#039;ve heard anecdotal evidence that it can extend your roll a bit, but if you want to do that you might as well buy some 2c-b. That does wonders for extending a roll, and really adds to the experience, AND it smooths the comedown by a lot if you are one of those people cursed to have bad comedowns. <br /><br />Some people recommend waiting a month between rolls, but if you maintain a regular regiment of 5-HTP up until a day or two before you roll and the week or so after you roll, you can probably get away with doing it every 2 - 3 weeks. And that&#039;s on the safe side. I&#039;ve known people to do it more than that with no problems, but everyone&#039;s body chemistry is different and you really have to feel out the situation before you can make any decisions like that. <br />

				L-Dopa seems to be fairly useless as a recreational drug. Its mechanism of action on the dopamine system is comparable to that of 5-htp on the serotonin system, but people don&#039;t usually lack dopamine at all, unless this is caused by disease. <br /><br />Adding extra dopamine to the brain of a healthy person doesn&#039;t do much since it doesn&#039;t increase the amount released by the neurons. Similarly, 5-htp doesn&#039;t have hat noticable an effect on most people unless they are for some reason short on serotonin. <br /><br />As for drug combination problems: Just do not take 5-htp in combination with ssri&#039;s or mdma, it will add nothing to the experience of the latter, but can pose a very serious health risk with both. Serotonin syndrom can be deadly, and also cause you to be unconcious, hindering diagnosis that could suggest a proper cause of action for medical workers. <br />

And yes, most parkinsonian drugs like L-Dopa and Requip seem to do very little recreationally. I&#039;m prescribed requip for my moderate restless leg syndrome, and have found that it has an extremely low abuse potential despite activating a fuckton of different receptors of all sorts in the brain. I think as far as dopamine goes it&#039;s a D1 and D6 receptor agonist, but I could be mistaken... I just remember those for some reason.

				My post roll 5-HTP regimen is 150mg per day for 2-3 days, then down to 100mg per day til the end of the week, then 50 per day for just a couple more days.<br /><br />Eat turkey! Turkey is full of tryptophan. Same with chicken! Great for balancing out your neurotransmitters.<br /><br />Someone said earlier to take 5HTP until you have vivid dreams...and that is interesting but the vivid dreams are more likely due to the fact that many 5-HTP supplements also combine Vitamin B6 (Aspartate) which is well known for causing vivid dreams that are more easily remembered. <br /><br />I seem to recall that there used to be a message board of people who would take really high doses of B6 right before bed (like 50mg!) and then they would share their dreams with others.

				B6 is pretty common in lots of things... from your multivitamin to energy drinks... fairly abundant in food.<br /><br />But if you are interested in the dream thing, then I highly recommend a sport supplement: ZMA, appropriately named because it contains Zinc, Magnesium, and Aspartate (B6).

				It might be one of those myths though. There is a similar one about vitamin B1 protecting you from mosquito bites - a fair number of people believe it does, while that effect has not been demonstrated in any tests. <br /><br />Supplements like zinc or magnesium aren&#039;t likely to cause any noticeable effect either, unless you are suffering from a deficiency. <br /><br />Things that are supposed to cause you to remember dreams and such can be effective as long as you believe in them though.
