				You have all probably seen my previous threads, trying to decide which form of hallucinogen to take.&nbsp; So here it is.&nbsp; I have decided on shrooms but seriously, looking at the market i do not know where to start.<br />Can anyone out there point me in the right direction please?

				I&#039;ve tried USAShroomz chocolate shroom bars and Rocker&#039;s shrooms. They are both comparable trip wise, the chocolate was a stronger trip for me even though it was supposed to be a full gram less. For the &#039;experience&#039; I would maybe go with Rocker&#039;s so you can relate to taking the shrooms, plus some people get paranoid on shrooms and if you are one then you may freak out wondering what was in that chocolate or how much of it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read plenty of good things on this forum about Galindoi&#039;s shrooms.

				The best advice about dosage is to go with what you feel at the time. If you know you are going to be anxious about diving in with a huge amount, take a smaller amount. If you know you are going to be wondering &quot;What if I took more&quot;, then take a large amount. A &quot;bad trip&quot; can happen at any dose, it&#039;s all about what is going through your head at the time. Take however much or however little you need to ensure that you won&#039;t be thinking about how much you took.

				Why not try ketamine have a line, the best thing is if you start tripping all you have to say to yourself is it lasts 45 minutes, you can almost time it after 45mins you completely snap out of it. With the shrooms you could mince them up and boil them up in a tea strain and drink it hits you in bout 20-40mins if you wanna trip more drink more tea. I recommend if you wanna trip be in a good mood with good friends that you can laugh your way through it with, don&#039;t trip on your own for the first time and don&#039;t go in with doubts or in the wrong frame of mind, go in wanting fun and it will be rad

				Thanks for the help guys.<br />I think im okay trying shrooms alone as this was intended to be a personal experience.&nbsp; Although i have tried ketamine, at the time it was good but i couldnt help feeling disappointing once the &quot;trip&quot; ended.<br />To me, ketamine seems to be more of a &quot;party&quot; drug.&nbsp; At the time we were all listening to loud music and i noticed that we were all inside our own little worlds somewhere.&nbsp; Fun, but not exactly spiritual.<br />You are right about the amount, this is something i have been questioning.&nbsp; But if i am after the ultimate trip then taking more instead of less sounds good!.<br />

If you were just wanting to &#039;see what it&#039;s like&#039; then I&#039;d say a half 8th, but to get the full experience I&#039;d say an 8th of good shrooms and you&#039;ll know from that experience whether or not you&#039;d rather try an 8th again or move up to intensify it even more.<br /><br />I really do recommend 25i nbome though, shrooms will give you perspective of psychedelics to have better lsd/nbome trips. Quality LSD is somewhat limited and pricey, I personally loved the 25i nbome and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good psychedelic experience.

				honestly, the best recommendation should reflect on your environment, company and free time.<br /><br />if you are around the beach, open land, forrest, some chilled out nature-ish area with people you trust and have 24hrs+ of NO RESPONSIBILITY....well, wear your most comfy clothes, turn off your cellphone and go hard on an 1/8th...embrace the momentary rocketship anxiety ride....and keep reminding yourself to SURRENDER to the shroom, let it take you over...thats a concept often over looked. when people think that can deny its possession...things can turn bad..but thats only if your an asshole about it.<br /><br />now if you have some sort of dilemma in those three key components (environment, company and free time) start subtracting the amount to eat.<br /><br />Example: Almost all my trips, I have a week to look over my life, relationships, everything, sort shit out, accept stuff, a sort of elongated/lazy self reflection/meditation thats purpose was to get ready to psychonaut. all those times I ate a shit load and ALWAYS felt better even after the trip and had a residual effect that was so powerful and positive that I was content to not trip again for months.<br /><br />only 2 times I looked over my leisure time and area i was in and what not and realized I had something to do early or some prick that was going to be around me or something that involved too much light and technology shit, so Id eat like 1.3grams-2.3 grams and enjoy a mild body load with decent visuals.<br /><br />just remember those key components and the concept of surrendering to the shrooms. and you will never be a newbie again.<br /><br />happy tripping

A couple shady looking ones at best, when I posted the only vendor with legit feedback was Oz but I think he only had powder form, USAShroomz has listings back up for the chocolate bars but for cubensis he only has 1 listing for sample bars (max 2, 2.5g each) and 1 listing for bulk, requiring 4 bars @ around $54 each. I&#039;m just looking for the middle ground, like 1oz or a half oz, but if I were you and wanting to try some I&#039;d definitely get 1 or 2 of the sample bars, 1 of them gave me a hell of a good trip a month or so ago.

				From what i understand liberty caps grow pretty much everywhere in the UK around summer time ay? Head on over to shroomery.org on the clear webz and study up mate. learn how to identify and pick your own. Fresh is best but the dosage for fresh is different from dried shrooms. Fresh pack more of a puch so be careful. I&#039;ve got about 60 recently dried and another 40 or so drying as we speak so I&#039;m set for the weekend&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Shroomy

				If it hasn&#039;t been stated already make sure you have some form of benzos on hand. Shit can get weird at time&#039;s to the point you won&#039;t enjoy it but most likely wont happen if your in a good mood and have a nice place to relax. I&#039;d recommended tripping during the day as it can be damn hard to fall a sleep at night. Which when your body&nbsp; is drained and your brain is tired but you can&#039;t fall a sleep thats when things get uncomfortable for me at least. <br /><br />Another thing to take in is that from what i heard shrooms on SR pretty potent start off light then you can always work your way up at a later time.

				you don&#039;t need benzos to trip, you just need to accept whatever happens and GO WITH THE FLOW. don&#039;t fight it or attempt to control it. let the divine mushroom be your guide. it&#039;s as simple as that. look up some terence mckenna on youtube... that should give ya some preparation.

				That is quite good advice, and if you start to get that anxious feeling just change up what you are doing. Little things change the whole world when you are tripping. Turn the lights off/on, remove a piece of clothing, go sit outside for a while etc

				In the right environment, shrooms can be the most incredible experience. But, it can also be pretty weird, I&#039;ve always heard my friends sitting in a dark dirty room just trying to get high off of it and they don&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on so they just fuck with each other. Just respect the spirit of the mushroom and you&#039;ll have a great time.

				Im said it before and ill say it again<br /><br />SURRENDER to the mushroom. Say in your mind &quot;lead me the way and ill enjoy the rest<br /><br />thats the frame of mind, to accept and give it your mind and body. and thats not a bad things. thats the thing that makes it become great, when you accept that you will be popping boners (figuratively speaking)

				Stick, love the idea of surrendering to the shroom mate.&nbsp; I have taken everyones advice, but seriously i dont think i will use benzos.&nbsp; In my mind its either do it properly or dont do it at all.&nbsp; Everyone is different of course.<br />Although i am unsure of what you mean by popping boners lol<br />You get hard-ons taking shrooms ?? lol
