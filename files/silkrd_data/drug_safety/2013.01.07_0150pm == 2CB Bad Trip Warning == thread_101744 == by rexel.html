			<dd class="postbody">
				Just wanted to post my trip experience as a warning to those who want to try 2CB.<br /><br />Prior to taking 2CB I researched it, and read as many trip reports/advice as I could find, however I feel that nothing out there was a sufficient warning as to how powerful this stuff is.<br /><br />The point of this post is not to say &#039;don&#039;t try 2CB&#039; - it&#039;s more of a &#039;what not to do so things don&#039;t go wrong&#039; kind of post. <br /><br />In retrospect I do realize that taking the 2CB at the time when I did and in the setting that I did was silly, and so hopefully this might prevent some people from going through what I went through.<br /><br />I also feel, however, that with the info that&#039;s out there (e.g. 2CB is the gentlest of the 2Cs, people taking 30mg doses) it&#039;s easy to underestimate this substance.<br /><br />To give a good balance, I&#039;m including a report overview of both my trips, one very good and one very bad.<br /><br />For both trips the dosage was 15mg.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Trip 1<br /><br />Setting: At home, alone, well rested, taken quite soon after waking up on an empty stomach. Dosage 15mg in Gel Cap.<br /><br />Trip duration: around 4 hours. Left the house at +3.36 when there were no more visuals to speak of, just a cloud over my thinking. Music/sound was still distorted at this time and walking felt weird.<br /><br />The come up was slow and gentle, easy to deal with, not overpowering at all. It started with my thoughts being more focused. Visuals started at +45, with gentle wobbling around the edges of my vision.<br /><br />They fully kicked in at the one hour mark at which point everything came to life. My experience with psychedelics is limited to salvia, but the visuals were the most beautiful thing I&#039;ve ever seen. <br /><br />Everything seemed to be alive, and had tonnes of depth to it. Flower-like patterns would appear on everything. For me this was the best aspect of the trip.<br /><br />I felt very very happy, probably even more so than on MDMA, but there was no rush of energy. I was quite happy to just sit down and look at things and think about life. <br /><br />Music was very enjoyable too, but I much preferred slow chilled out music. I tried listening to some trance and it wasn&#039;t pleasant. Something to maybe consider if you&#039;re planning to take this at a rave.<br /><br />My thought process was very very weird. It seems that there are two sides to this drug: one makes you see everything move, and everything is pretty. The other side is much darker - you feel as if you notice things that no one else can, but these are usually bad things. For quite some time my thinking became very cynical, mocking and arrogant. The feelings of happiness took a very weird turn when I suddenly saw myself (in my head) as a jester. I know this sounds weird, but I just saw myself as a little smiling mischievous goblin that was finding everything funny. <br /><br />I was writing up my thoughts and feelings at the time and browsing through facebook and I remember thinking very mean things about certain people. <br /><br />At the same time I felt a great urge to share this experience with people (I didn&#039;t) and to get try it with as many people as possible. I nearly ended up ordering a gram of the stuff online at the time. There was a weird sense of urgency in my thoughts. The most logical way of putting this into words is that it time no longer had any meaning, but it felt like it was running out. <br /><br />I had a timer on during my trip, but I found the concept of time very confusing. Sometimes it would rush by, at other time it would go awfully slow. <br /><br />There is also a very sexual side to this drug, which is heavily linked with feeling of happiness. In short I felt like some sort of ancient demi-god, and my dancing was at times very sexual which is very unusual for me as I hate dancing. <br /><br />Overall after trip 1 I fell in love with 2 CB - great but not overpowering visuals, a different way of thinking, happiness, heightened senses - and I found the jester episode funny rather than worrying. The comedown was gentle and pleasant, and if anything I felt happy afterwards. I also noted that this substance should be respected and not abused. <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Trip 2<br /><br />And so it&#039;s kind of my own fault that things went bad on the second trip. The key points for this trip, which I believe had a serious impact on why it turned out the way it did were:<br /><br />- Tiredness/lack of sleep/bad mood? - taken at 11.30 p.m when I was feeling tired after a whole day at work, and I knew I had to be up early the next day. I got more tired as the trip went on, and so subconsciously I&nbsp; couldn&#039;t wait for the trip to end, and seeing as time was warped I got more and more annoyed when it was going on and on. <br /><br />- Taken alone - bad bad bad idea. But having been fine alone on trip 1 I assumed it wouldn&#039;t be a problem to do it on my own again. <br /><br />- Taken 2 days in a row - I have no idea how long 2CB stays in the body for, but I believe this was a very strong factor here - the second trip happened 35 hours after the first one - but was way more intense even though the dose was the same (15mg Orally).<br /><br />- I remembered reading someones bad trip report on how they woke up naked not knowing what they&#039;d done.<br /><br />In short, the trip started really good, but then things took a bad turn. I was again writing a report whilst on the drug. At one point I went outside to do the bins. On coming back I looked at the time and wrote &#039;anything could have happened in the last 45 mins and I wouldn&#039;t have a clue&#039;. <br /><br />That thought set me off. I tried to not think about it, but the more I tried the more difficult it got. In the meanwhile the visuals got way more intense, it was no longer gentle and pleasant, nor did i feel like I was under control. Everything had 4 dimensions to it, and I existed in all 4, but it wasn&#039;t me who was in control of my body.<br /><br />In short I went though a massive panic attack, which lasted about 4 hours. Even thinking straight was difficult. I basically felt that in that 45 mins I did something really really bad. My short term memory was gone. Although I thought I knew I just spent all that time in my room dancing, I simply couldn&#039;t account for it all in my head (this had a lot to do with the time perception being so warped). I knew that the trip should end at around 4 hours from ingestion, but time meant nothing and was confusing. <br /><br />I had semi-suicidal thoughts - i.e. I was worried I might take my own life. I am normally a very happy person, I have a happy life, a good job, a happy relationship and so this was very out of character for me. I was stunned by the way my brain worked. This is an extract from my trip notes:<br /><br />&#039;the mistake was I was anticipating something to go wrong. The combination of wanting to go to sleep and the <br />recollection of someone elses account of how they thought they&#039;d killed someone were enough to set me off.<br /><br />I kept listening to happy happy songs but my mind was already stirred. I remember writing<br />&#039;I could have done anything&#039; and then deleting it in panic. Before that I was looking through<br />the window and saw some cops.<br /><br />Somehow my mind amplified all that.<br /><br />I now had an hour of time which was un-accoutnable for. My short term memory was wiped out completely.<br />I had to actively tell myself everything was ok, and to calm myself down.<br /><br />There was no stopping it; unlike before there was no way to snap out of the vision - it became the new reality.<br /><br />Everything took a sinister spin. All the ads [I was watching telly] seemed to warped; &#039;just send us your details to win&#039;. AT the time it all<br />seemed like a plot.<br /><br />Id think I was back, being happy to focus on a face, familiar sound or object, and then the evilness would resume.<br /><br />The best way of describing it is hot rising air, everything split into 4-layers and then put together so everything isnt quite right.<br /><br />I thought i could just sleep it off, but then the darkness was scarier than the light when I closed my eyes.<br /><br />My main panicked thoughts were just survival. But then everything i knew or thought i knew was cast into doubt.<br /><br />Drink more water, youll get rid of it quicker. But what if you overhydrate. I felt cold, so I got under the blanket. But it could be a false alarm<br />just my body being so fucked up it didnt know what it was doing. I felt my hair to check whether it was dry or wet. It was both. <br /><br />My normal sensory observations meant nothing. <br /><br />And then there was time.<br /><br />In this world it was an alien concept.<br /><br />I kept juggling three times: the current time, the time since taking 2cB and then time when i was expecting it to start wearing off (+3 hours)<br />judging by my previous experience.<br /><br />And i am so greatful that i made notes. It sort of calmed me down because i knew id been here before.<br /><br />I was paranoid and afraid that id already hurt someone, or that i could still hurt someone.<br /><br />At one point i got out my ties and wanted to tie my hands and feet together to stop myself from hurting anyone or doing anything bad.<br /><br />Then my &#039;sober&#039; mind had an instant realization and said WTF put that down you could strangle yourself.<br /><br />My thoughts ran deeper than Ive ever had them run before.<br /><br />When getting hot chocolate, i put some sugar in, and wanted to stir it, but all that was there was knives. <br /><br />My mind screamed to leave the knives alone.<br /><br />At one point my exact thoughts were if i slit my wrists i wonder what would come out. This was as I was looking at all my veins etc&#039;<br /><br />I ended up watching the news to calm myself down. The fact that I wasn&#039;t mentioned on the news came as a relief, and it at least made me think that if I had one something bad it wasn&#039;t bad enough to make the news. As mentioned before everything was sinister, the whole world was scheming. something.<br /><br />I felt really helpless inside, and felt like my end was inevitable. I genuinely though I could end up taking my life. I felt sad for letting down my other half, my friends and my parents. <br /><br />I also felt angry that I took the drug. I ended up flushing (and filming the flushing) the remainder of my 2CB caps. I also wrote a note saying &#039;NO MORE DRUGS JUST WORK&#039;.<br /><br />The trip lasted longer than previously, around +4.30 which did little to calm my paranoia. <br /><br />I was just so happy to be back, but it took me a good hour of sitting outside at night drinking water and watching people to calm me down. <br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Conclusion.<br /><br />Was I silly? Yes. Would I do it again? I probably will. Overall I&#039;m thankful for the experience. I genuinely feel it has made me a better person, I take things for granted a bit less now, and I am also calmer (if i got through this, everyday &#039;problems&#039; are not a worrying).<br /><br />But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE respect this substance. <br /><br />Don&#039;t take it when tired, or in a bad mood. <br /><br />For gods sake don&#039;t take it alone. If I had had a sitter I doubt the trip would have gone bad at all.<br /><br />Be very careful with the dosage. From other people&#039;s reports 15mg is considered a low dose, lots of people say they take 20mg+, some go 30mg+.&nbsp; Start low. If I was to ever take it again, I&#039;d go down to 10mg. <br /><br />I&#039;d be weary of taking it two days in a row, I genuinely feel that it strengthens the effects significantly.&nbsp; <br /><br />If taking for the first time, make sure someone knows you&#039;re taking it. I&#039;d take it in a controlled environment (home) first. I&#039;m so glad that panic attack didn&#039;t happen at a rave. <br /><br />And don&#039;t be fooled by reports which say it&#039;s a harmless, gentle substance. <br />

				psychedelic phenethylamines are a bit trickier than tryptamines...<br /><br />amphetamines themselves have phenethylamine cores and when 2C-B was administered to rats they exhibited amphetamine like behaviors...<br /><br />amphetamines tend to make people overthink and paranoid...<br /><br />this coupled with 2C-B&#039;s tendency to make one really aware of their own bodies can lead to some unpleasant ideation...especially if one is sick or extremely fatigued...

				Interesting. I took 25mg my first time and my experience was no where close to this. I just remember having a really good time. I liked it so much I&#039;m going to try it again.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never taken any other psychedelic before. What I liked about 2CB is how clear headed I was, just that everything around me looked weird and interesting. I did have a feeling that I had mind powers but it was only a feeling, I didn&#039;t actually believe it.<br /><br />But I&#039;ll still heed your warning some and if I ever have a bad trip I&#039;ll be sure to post it here and say you were right.

Interesting how you were considering flushing your stash too though. And I get what you mean about feeling really high, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been as high as on 2CB, but this isn&#039;t necessarily a good thing. I can also relate to the humbling side of it, I felt so small and insignificant (I remember writing down that this stuff should be respected) and also regretful about doing drugs in general. <br />
