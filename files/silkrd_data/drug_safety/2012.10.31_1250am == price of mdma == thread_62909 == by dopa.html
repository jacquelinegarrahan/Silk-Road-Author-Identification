			<dd class="postbody">
				Not really sure if this is a proper question for the forums but...i got a guy thats tryna buy some larg(ish) amounts of mdma (which he then resells) from me but i Dont really know what the going rate is. iv been selling G&#039;s for 120 and that seems to be around the price or slightly cheaper then not as good quality &quot;molly&quot; on the street. This guy wants to buy anywhere up to a QP, although we will probably start with a Oz or two, but i Dont know what to charge him.<br /><br />Anways, does anybody know the wholesale price of MDMA on the US Westcoast? what would be a fair price for a zip?<br /><br />thanks!

				Do you guys live in the States? the only times i have ever seen G&#039;s under 100 has been at festivals, and the quality has never been on par with SR quality. usually g&#039;s of this quality go for around 150 (street level)

				Price with all the fees and stuff plus postage/stealth I dont know. I only know I was able to get about 80% pure crystals a few years ago for about 10-20 euro&#039;s. 1 euro is 1.3 dollars at the moment I think.<br /><br />Once/if I become a vendor I&#039;ll try to show that good mdma doesn&#039;t have to be expensive. I&#039;d rather let people donate if they like it.<br />Some retard buys stuff from SR from here (NL) and sells it in the states for more than 10 times the amount of btc&#039;s. Such a shame. Mdma produces lovely feelings. Why rip people off with stuff that&#039;s supposed to make them have awesome times with perhaps even life changing insights or overcome mental issues???<br />

				it fluctuates by area in the US but the average price i&#039;ve seen throughout my travels, not including festivals, is between $100 and $120. however, at festivals, its normally more expensive, averaging $150. the only exception to that $150 i know of was at electric forest, where if you were lucky enough to have found the right people, they were selling a g for $90, and it wasn&#039;t shit quality, but pure as it gets. these are the prices for quality btw, not cut shit. as for the prices on here, once you start buying bulk, most prices are below $35 a gram, while the best i have seen/gotten was around $21 a gram. there are better deals, but you have to buy in larger quantities to get those discounts.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen the same, for it to be a $100/g though $80 is common enough and it&#039;s lower if you know the guy. In england I never ever would have paid more than 40 GBP/g (55-60 usd) and 40 euro on the continent. $150 is fucking outrageous but if that&#039;s you&#039;re only option then... let&#039;s just say I would be finding alternatives like SR asap.

				the only time i ever really saw it for $150 was at festivals because everyone wants to get fucked up. also, once people see its crystal shards, they are usually willing to pay that price, with people often buying more then enough for the festival so they can bring some home with them.

				Sorry offtopic.<br /><br />In Finland I sell good MDMA for 150 euros (~190$) per a gram. Imagine that I pay from my MDMA about 20 dollars per g (~17 euros). It&#039;s so easy to make money here, as the prices for every drug are high as fuck.

				MDMA is £40 in the UK street but you only get around .7&nbsp; .8 if your lucky and its not usually good quality unless you know the right people. Personally i pay around £18-30 dependant on how much i buy at once. Usually a load of us will chip in get a big bulk and shot it on to others. Where i live i believe i could get rid of an ounce within a few days easily.

The prices for grams generally isn&#039;t that high around here more like 80-130, but Dutch&#039;s MDMA blows anything most people have ever had in their lives way out of the water, so I can get away with those prices because they know the extreme quality.People roll pretty nicely off just 100 mg&#039;s of it, unlike lots of &#039;molly&#039; sold around these parts which you have to take 2-4 hits to have a good time. West coast USA is generally cheaper as far as MDMA goes, with prices averaging around more like $70-$100 a gram and $10-$15 a hit.

Pills generally go for no less than 20 a pop here to a standard buyer, as far as I am concerned one hit (100 mg&#039;s) of Dutch&#039;s molly for the same price or a bit lower is extremely reasonable considering you will roll harder than taking one of your average E pill. In my opinion I am running my business as efficiently as possible, making the most amount of money I can charging a price that most people pay already for product far worse than what I have. I am not losing any customers over these prices and no one has ever complained. Call me greedy but I also am the one taking the risk of getting large amounts of product shipped to me, so I will make sure the price is worth it for my own risks. I do this purely to make money, sorry if it is a disappointment that I&#039;m &#039;not in it for the love&#039; but I consider my ethic of selling to be very reasonable considering the fact I never cut product or short people, therefore providing them with quality of MDMA most have never experienced close to.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Be glad your not buying your molly in AUS. People pay $30e for a pill or cap of ecstasy usually produced domestically and usually containing RC chems / BZP&#039;s /speed and any assortment of who knows wtf, and that&#039;s considered the norm, but only for the most part because people haven&#039;t had the legit 84% uncut dutch and don&#039;t know what the true magic is or simply just can&#039;t get it... Once you show them the light, you&#039;ve suddenly got a lot of new friends.<br /><br />Recently had a regular indulger of AUS produced pills try one of my dutch caps for the first time.. Got a text later that night saying saying how fucking incredible it was, needless to say, we catch up a lot more often.<br /><br />$2.10c it costs to pack a 100mg cap, with people happily buying them by the dozens at $30 knowing full well it&#039;s the good stuff, suddenly a 1000%+ markup seems generous. Especially knowing that there are illicit entrepreneurs out there who charge $50 for good stuff with people still happy to pay.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				settled for 1600 an OZ... with all due respect to the people that say you shouldnt sell over 80...we are taking risks importing a controlled substance into the US ....SR makes the risk easy to forget because its easy to order but believe me its there - every order we make something can go wrong ...iv been selling g&#039;s for 120 and people are MORE then happy to buy them because it beats ANYTHING on the streets right now. i take the risk, they are happy campers - win-win :D

				Methylone has completely destroyed the MDMA market. I&#039;ve been trying to sell dutch SR molly $15 for a single .100 capsule and people just complain about the price saying they get it for $5-10 per capsule. Some people don&#039;t even believe what I have is molly because it looks different than the white powder they get.

				US here...any decent molly capped around 130 or so...goes for 20 bucks around here.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t take any less than 100g....usually get closer to 120 or more.

You can find shit Molly&#039;s here for $8-$15 per gram and for an O $800-$1200. All depends on how shitty it is. With SR quality, you can easily get $185-$200 per gram and $1500-$1800 for an O.. Trust, you can easily do so, you just have to be confident in your product! It&#039;s just a matter of convincing them to try it first!
