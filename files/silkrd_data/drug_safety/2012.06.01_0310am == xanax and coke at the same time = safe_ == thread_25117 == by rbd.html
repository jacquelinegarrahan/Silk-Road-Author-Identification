				What order do you take them in?<br /><br />Some people like to get high on coke, and later decide to have a xanax and go to bed after all. This is not especially dangerous with reasonable doses for either.<br /><br />Doing both simultaneously is another matter though. Since many of the effects are counteractive, you risk taking too high of a dose of either (or both?) substance.&nbsp;

				IMHO, No. These are both real powerful drugs by themselves, affecting seemingly &quot;opposite&quot; parts of the brain. Again, just my humble &amp; not well informed opinion. I ain&#039;t an M.D., otherwise I&#039;d charge you $207,548,986.14 for 2 minuted of babble. LOL

				i&#039;ve been doing this for a while based on research i did a while ago. basically doing this is somewhat safe but only if you are very careful about doses because one drug masks the other. your best bet to keeping this safe though is to use xanax after you&#039;ve done your last lines or only taking really small doses while high. by small i mean .5mg or less.<br /><br />basically this is a speedball and should be treated as one.

Assuming you have some nice SR coke anyway, the comedown shouldn&#039;t be bad and why would you need benzos while blowing lines? Lines alone with some cigarettes or some beers too are great

				i&#039;m sure it&#039;s safe as long as you&#039;re not going buckwild with both of them...<br /><br />but i&#039;d save the xanax for when you&#039;re coming down, since xanax &amp; coke really work at cross purposes...<br /><br />

Not only do the blood vessels in your nose contract as more cocaine is in your system (as in snorting other drugs after cocaine isn&#039;t the most effective way to go about hings), but most of the effects of the xanax are from the drip that you orally consume. The rest just clogs up your nose.<br /><br />JuStSaYiN 8)

				When I said 100% safe I assumed the OP knew proper use of cocaine.&nbsp; I was referring to using Coke and Xanax as safe together.&nbsp; They wont cause a negative interaction.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s the smartest idea by no means but it wont hurt you either if you follow safe usage guidelines. <br /><br />JUST DON&quot;T OVER DO IT!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Stunt Bum

				My boy had a seizure at Ultra from doing Coke and Xanax. I have no idea by what you mean &quot;They wont cause a negative interaction. &quot; A seizure sounds pretty negative to me. My friend literally thought this guy was to die.

				I LOVE the combo personally. As foxy said EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT, know your body. USE SAFELY. Sorry for yelling those points but they are important. I think of it as a less intense then street speed balling, but for me, its bliss. <br /><br />Just me man, you are not me, so know you ya know :)

				If you have some shitty cut speedy yak, take a benzo before doing lines so your not so tweaked and needing a line every five minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;When your crashing take a comfortable dose of Benzos so you soften the crash and cravings.<br /><br />I personally always use Benzos and coke together. Its technically speed balling so you got to keep that shit under control!<br /><br />I had a seizure from speed balling four days straight on coke, morphine, Valiums.....not fun
