				Hi I looked but can&#039;t find the answer on the forum , so I read somewhere that you can wash coke with ethanol, methanol, or even Isopropyl alcohol. Is this true? I can&#039;t find nearly as much info on it as the more common acetone wash. I am going to try an acetone wash on coke i get irl but is defo cut with amphetamine which acetone doesn&#039;t remove.<br /><br />sparkus

				Yeah I agree anhydrous acetone is probably your best choice. Mixing chemicals with coke can be a tedious and slightly dangerous process. Especially if you are not very experienced <br /><br />If your getting stuff that&#039;s cut with levimisole or amphetamines I&#039;d just bite the bullet on this batch and work on finding a new supplier :/

				lol you don&#039;t.<br /><br />Often times after an acetone wash you get significantly less cocaine depending on the source and the purity.<br /><br />You may be confusing acetone washing with cutting agents. <br /><br />Even so with very pure cocaine you probably not going to want to cut down to 33% original product.<br /><br />Might pass as decent street coke in certain areas but you&#039;ll loose out on return customers and professional bulk buyers.

				I actually just tried the Ethanol wash (Everclear 191 proof) if it&#039;s available in your area.<br /><br />The issue with acetone is that it needs to be anhyrdous (without water) to work well. Cocaine is very water absorbing and the purpose of the acetone is to clump up just the cocaine hcl and leave the cut in the acetone, then you pour it through a coffee filter or two, and dry it back out.<br />(You do need to add epsom salts on aluminum foil and bake at a low temp on the oven, the pour that into the Acetone to absorb any water)<br />&nbsp;<br />On the clearnet Google&nbsp; LeJunk&#039;s Acetone wash, he has a good writeup that I have followed before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Back to the Ethanol/Everclear wash. This was REALLY easy to do.<br />-Get Everclear pour ~15ml of ethanol per 1g of Cocaine into a glass cup. (stir slightly to dissolve it all)<br />-Place a coffee filter on top of another glass cup<br />-Pour dissolved cocaine liquid through filter into collecting glass cup<br />-Pour filtered mixture onto a flat glass/ceramic plate to dry/evaporate. Putting a warm lightbulb overhead&nbsp; will head do this faster, or using a warming plate on the lowest setting. Give that ~24-48 hours to completely dry out, and enjoy!<br /><br />It&#039;s scary at first because I tried this with 2g and it all dissolved, BUT after it starts drying back out you start to see a goopy yummy mess, the more you cut that and it dries, the better the powder appears.&nbsp; IT did actually work, as I pulled out .2 of white powder cut (not sure what it was).

				Stolen from the Cocaine vendors review/list from -- Redalloverthelandguyhere<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I doubt very much sesampinos coke is 0%! I had a tester of the sale coke - it was very powdery but I was a LOT more animated on 100g or less than I was with 1500mg of speed doktors sleeping paste.<br /><br />I am going to wash sesampinos cheaper coke and have ordered my acetone (100%) plus some Epson salts to bake and add to the acetone which removes ALL water. Putting Epson salts into a home cooker on 400 degrees for two hours will turn your Epsom salt into anhydrous magnesium sulphate powder.<br /><br />Most commercial acetone does have water in there, 1 gram of coke will vanish in 1 ml of water so need NO water washing coke!<br /><br />Also acetone does not remove ephedrine or amphetamines! To test coke for amphetamines is simple! Fill a small glass with some plain bleach. Drop 1mg of the coke into it. If you see some reddish coloration in the granules then its amphetamines! Only a twat would put speed in good coke.<br /><br />Trick with amphetamines is that it takes 3.2ml of ether alcohol to dissolve cocaine. But with amphetamine it takes (off the top of my head about 500ml. So washing the speed from the coke is easy really. For one gram of coke 10ml of ether into a container, top on and shake. Filter it as normal. Add more ether to get out any remaining coke. <br /><br />To get the ephedrine out its ether but you can find posts on this and people who know this procedure inside out. It is so easy! Really.<br /><br />I&#039;m excited as I done my my first wash! I discovered the coke has speed in it! I also lost about 60-70% of the actual &#039;coke&#039; - the remaining stuff I left to evaporate on a plate and it looks like coke or good speed - even meth! God knows what it is! bit there is more of that than the actual remains of the coke!All I know is that is it is the garbage that we normally put up our nose. I&#039;ve saved myself snorting a lot of useless rubbish and feel good about it. I feel not so good that I bought cocaine advertised as &#039;better than your local UK street or pub coke&#039;. Better than some perhaps but its still shit coke!<br /><br />So the 800 mg special now becomes 150mg of coke with speed added! When I get the speed out (which is easy even for a 15 yr old studying chemistry!) I reckon I maybe have 50mg or so of coke! The most expensive line I ever ever had!!<br /><br />My advice to anyone who uses a lot of power is to do basic chemistry. you can buy a &#039;kids&#039; chemistry set with ALL the stuff you will ever need. Cleaning coke is simple and I would love to sell kits on here with all the chemicals needed. The chemicals are legal but some are watched if you order&nbsp; lot!&nbsp; Anyone who works in a firm with license can order them if they are on good terms with the lab manager! Its amazing how little you need - 250ml bottles of ether, acetone and chloroform plus you long glass dropper, glass funnels and filter papers. Even the reagents uses to test your drugs - I was blown away at how cheap these chemicals are when you buy a liter! There are MANY cheap reagents which work just as good at detecting various things like speed, ephedrine and other shit. Between ether, acetone and chloroform you have the basic kit to create cocaine that will make you likely give up buying coke so much. you will become picky. Vendors can praise the product to the high heavens but these three cheap chemicals actually prove pretty much whether you have decent coke or not. <br /><br />I have just spent an hour washing out a UK cheap coke, one sold on SR as a sale special (they are not coke vendors in the least!)<br /><br />I had 800mg of the coke - so took 650mg to wash. I had no funnel so made do with a filter folded over a glass bottle top. It worked well but I ordered a glass funnel through work. We have a lab in some dept I rarely visit and I never knew they had a license to get tricky things! I have ordered chloroform - now anhydrous ethyl alcohol (ethanol), 190 proof, 95%, ACS grade) I scrounged some items from the lab manager who did do a few lines of coke back in New Year 2005! We bonded smoking some top grade hash! <br /><br />So my next hope is that a mate saved some of the yellow speed he ordered off the speed doktor (no reply off the guy yet) I&#039;d like to see how much of the 5g or 10g comes out as speed. I really got visions of us getting like a couple of lines of speed. A line of speed that cost more than a blowjob. Not that I pay for BJs - unless you count the Valentines cards, chocolates and love letters!<br /><br />So that was my first wash. Will wait to get other chemicals before trying as there IS speed in this mix. I know not how much and it could be meth also - which would really make you feel something but I want to feel that classic subtle coke - not the UK up all night too paranoid to bang the wife and too uninspired to do something creative.<br /><br />So if my coke turns out to be a 50 mg from 800mg - the original cost just over 2 bitcoins for 200 mg (200mg was free) It works out about 120 BTC for a gram of coke!!!!!<br /><br />Like WTF!<br /><br />Are we made of money here?<br /><br />lol<br /><br />So - get cleaning and we will make coke dealers clean up their act or find suppliers that do not repress the blocks before selling on.<br /><br />Washing is THE weapon to ensure SR only has good coke vendors.<br /><br />I myself use coke so rarely its hard to justify but my women uses seldom and I will wash ALL coke from now on. I will be getting samples of 100mg and if I end up with less than 50% coke then its misleading advertising and claims of 70^ purity or more have to be taken down IF trusted members so the washes with various chemicals and we all see the results.<br /><br />I was amazed at what shit I would have been putting up my nose. Basically looks like its 90% + shit. <br /><br />I will contact the vendor with the report but it was a sale special and he bought an 8 ball or something to help the sale have more items. It was not a rip off in my opinion, just the usual UK street/pub/club coke.<br /><br />Basically total shit.<br /><br />I&#039;m no glad i am not a coke head in the UK.<br /><br />For Americans, I got there and snort some mad coke - its just feel good all the way - inspiration and party time for all! UK is fighting, couples falling out, people getting glasses and strangers accosting you in the street and 16 yr olds with blood stained shits who want to fight the world.<br /><br />Wash that coke!<br /><br />Lets see more reports on washes.<br /><br />I got photos of the 100mg of the so called coke untouched, the shit that was cleaned out and the stuff left so far that still has speed in it!<br /><br />Interesting night, Chemistry is fun.<br /><br />Next clean up is 900mg of sesampinos sale &#039;quality cocaine&#039;. There IS cocaine in it for sure! how much we will see. Washes do not lie. Performed correctly your loss of any cocaine ought to be less than 1% of the weight (usually coke stuck to filter)<br /><br />I will get a friend to order for me as some dealers will read this and make a note to send me their own stash. I only buy coke for the missus and usually end up with shit. With chemistry it is worth buying a real life 8 ball which would only cost 25 BTC. Off &#039;the block&#039;. ( a solid block) Even if its just 30% I would be doing better in real life than for some of the deals here. Cannot wait to wash one of my mates prized &#039;pure as the driven snow&#039; 8 balls and watch him become worried as the 8 ball becomes smaller and watch him grow even gloomier as I tell him we have found amphetamine and need to wash that out.<br /><br />But if people use this street rubbish and allow dealers to treat them like shit - we will always be ripped off.<br /><br />As someone who does not use coke I feel I am doing the community here a duty by reporting how easy it is to wash.. I enjoy hash and would hate for it to be less than perfect. Coke should be washed by vendors really but my guess is they would have to sell for 30 -&nbsp; 50BTC a gram&nbsp; at least and people would complain.<br /><br />If I can sell kits they would cost less than 5 BTC I guess. But its easy to source the chemicals I mentioned and they are great for polishing the ornaments,<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Hope your day tomorrow is a good one.<br /><br />Cheers!

				I can&#039;t get everclear here in the uk, can&#039;t really get any sort of ethanol other than stuff for cars easily. I know I should try acetone 1st and I will, but I can get isopropanol easily so was wondering if it would work instead of ethanol?

				here how i do my acetone wash i post the other 3 kind of wash as well if someone asks. just a copy and paste form where i found out how to do the wash. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, please note that I&#039;ll be using 3 grams of adulterated cocaine as my example for this procedure, so keep that in mind. You should use 15 ml.s of acetone per every 1 gram of cocaine.<br /><br />Crush up your 3 grams of adulterated cocaine as fine as possible. I have personally found that using a fine screened juice strainer best for getting finely ground powder.<br /><br />Pour your crushed up cocaine into 45-50 ml.s of acetone. Put the cap back onto your acetone bottle immediately to avoid any moisture from the air getting in. Stir the cocaine in the acetone for approx. 3-5 minutes making sure to get around the bottom edges etc. Cover with a small piece of paper or something to keep any moisture out and let settle until the cleaned cocaine crystals are on the bottom and your acetone at the top has become completely clear or dirty looking, but free of any crystals floating in it. This should take anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes.<br /><br />Now, carefully pour your dirty acetone into a filter placed inside of your plastic funnel and resting atop your drinking glass. It is important on this first run to stop as short of any cocaine falling out into the filter as possible (it&#039;s okay if some crystals fall into the filter paper, leave them there). This will provide us with the opportunity to perform a second wash on the crystals in the beaker. Now, with some crystals stuck to the side of the beaker from pouring and most at the bottom, pour 30 more ml.s of fresh acetone into the beaker trying to collect those crystals stuck on the side while pouring in. Stir again and cover. This time, pour your entire contents into the filter paper. If some crystals are left clinging to the beaker, pour a lil&#039; fresh acetone in, swirl and pour them in as well. With your clean crystals inside the filter paper, cover. Once all, or most of the acetone has drained thru into the drinking glass, pour 20 more ml.s of fresh acetone into the filter paper. This will provide us with the third and last cleansing. Cover and let drain completely. This could take 5-10 minutes at the most.<br /><br />Once all of the acetone has drained thru, carefully remove the filter paper containing the newly cleaned and now beautiful crystals and place it between three or four paper towels. Fold the towels over the filter paper and press firmly on the cocaine to absorb any additional acetone. Discard paper towels and place the somewhat dried filter paper still containing the crystyals under a heat lamp for approx. 20 minutes. Remove from under heat lamp.<br /><br />Now, this last step is very important. For your own health and for the true taste, feel and aesthetics of the newly cleaned cocaine, you must let it evaporate on it&#039;s own, still inside of the filter paper for at least 24 hours in a non-humid environment. At the 24+ mark, gently heat the crystals, while still inside of the filter paper, for approx. 10 minutes or so. Remove from heat.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />also it use pure acetone or your lost will be a lot more.<br /><br />as mntmnwva posted it helps to add the anhydrous magnesium sulphate powder to the acetone. there no need to buy the ACS grade or the higher kind it cost a hell lot more then buying the acetone at a hardware store, the acetone you can get form the hardware store is just as good as the ACS grade one when you add the powder to it. (have tested it the lost is about the same if not the same. with the way im going to post how i make it) <br /><br />here how i make the acetone i use for my wash.<br /><br />just buy it form any hardware store. take your anhydrous magnesium sulphate powder what mntmnwva posted how to make. put in the acetone about 10g of the power for every 1 liter of acetone in the container. shake it very well. i shake it for like 5 mins or so then wait a 1 hr and shake it 1 more time for a other 5 mins or so. then let it stand for 24+ hrs. after the 24+ hrs pour it out into a container that has a airtight lid (the one i use is just the one the ACS grade acetone came in so dont know if just any container that has a airtight lid will work) with a glass lab funnel with a lab filter paper inside the funnel. <br /><br />also dont know how must if any using a glass lab funnel and lab filter paper helps. over just some plastic funnel and a coffee filter or some other kind. i use all lab kind for all of this b/c i just fell it will come out better if done like it was in a lab lol. <br />

				When making anhydrous acetone with epsom salts, how long can can the mix be kept in a airtight jar for? Or should I add more baked epsom salts before each use? I will only be washing every couple of weeks. Also once the salts have been baked can they be kept dry or will they start absorbing moisture again?
