				Anyone here try this combination? Is it a good combination?<br />I have read reports that alcohol, amphetamine and weed are supposedly a bad combination for the cardiovascular system, although the evidence seems to be only anecdotal. Not sure if this is because of the weed though.

				Uhhh, yeah! I live my everyday life on this combo. Its pretty much the best. You get all of the benefits of both, while the speed keeps you sharp after the weed wears off and curbs your appetite a bit too, but the weed boosts your appetite just enough so you eat a normal amount. Vyvanse and weed is all I need.

				I find mixing weed with any stimulant makes my heart race a bit too much to be comfortable. I don&#039;t find the mix particularly pleasant, except when I&#039;m at the end of the comedown period. Then a bunch of vicodin and a vape helps me eat and sleep. I never drink alcohol, but when I take stimulants I find drink a couple beers is really nice. It calms down the edginess and increases sociability.<br /><br />At least one study has shown that mixing cocaine and weed is worse for your heart than cocaine alone. Not sure if this applies to amphetamine as well.

				I&#039;d advise against this combo if you struggle with anxiety at all. Both drugs have a tendency to cause anxiety/the jitters. Combining the two could lead to a panic attack (If you can&#039;t handle the increase in heart rate). If you&#039;ve never had a panic attack, let me tell you they&#039;re not pretty.<br /><br />You notice an increase in heart rate<br />You try to stay calm, tell yourself its ok<br />Your heart rate is still high<br />You keep breathing but you&#039;re convinced you&#039;re going to have a heart attack<br />You get a bit light headed, right you&#039;re convinced your having a heart attack<br /><br />It&#039;s just a horrible cycle... most panic attacks don&#039;t last that long, but they&#039;re not nice!<br /><br />If you don&#039;t struggle with anxiety and you have experience with both drugs, you most likely will be fine and have a good time. But start off taking low amounts of both, and gradually build up until you&#039;re at a comfortable level. Don&#039;t go all out and take a lot of both, as this may be too intense and you might panic.<br /><br />Have fun, take it easy and stay high ;)<br /><br />Another good combo is MD + Weed. MD takes away anxiety and paranoia, so combining Weed with MD is fucking brilliant! Weed really does increase MD&#039;s euphoric properties. I&#039;m not a smoker myself, but I love that combo!

When it comes down to it though, almost any drug can cause anxiety, aside from the intended effects of sedatives like benzo or alcohol, but coming off of benzos or alcohol can cause SEVERE anxiety, as I have exerienced. I am diagnosed with panic disorder, I have been to the ER like 5 or 6 times because of panic attacks (thinking I was dying).&nbsp; MOst of those times I was suffering acute alcohol WD from isoated booze binges. Anyway, the advice you give is sound, especially starting with low doses of each. Getting too high on weed can make anyone anxious.&nbsp; But in my experience, as someone with panic disorder, I am prescribed Vyvanse and fall in and out of pothead habits, but this combo is the one I have experienced more than any other drug combo in my life, and I have very rarely, if ever, had a severe episode of anxiety because of it. So approach with caution, like with any drug combo, but it really is a great one. Also, like homie said there isn&#039;t anything better when coming down off a substantial dose of amph than a few beers (in my case usually more like 6-8).&nbsp; It evens you act and takes the edge of perfectly, and there is no specific interaction that I know of.

				By the way, to &#039;sollemnis&#039;<br /><br />What&#039;s MD? Are you speaking of MDMA? Cause that combo is amazing, but I am curious what this &#039;MD&#039; is that you speak of.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also add that there is certainly no dangerous chemical interaction with amphetamine and weed. Yes your heart rate can be raised, but that is mainly due to anxiety and often subsides after a short period of time. Unless you have some kind of heart condition in which amphetamine in general would be a bad idea, than its not a risky or harmful combo. I mean, THC is rarely ever risky or harmful PHYSICALLY, although it can be psychologically problematic with certain individuals.

Obviously if you have an underlying heart condition it is a no-no. <br /><br />&nbsp;You&#039;re right, caution should be taken when taking any drug or drug combo. <br /><br />Yes, Benzo withdrawal and Alcohol withdrawal can cause bad anxiety. I&#039;ve never had a Benzo addiction, but I&#039;ve heard the withdrawal isn&#039;t at all pretty. <br /><br />On the subject of Benzos, I&#039;d advise anyone using Stims to keep a Valium handy, 10 mgs is enough. Just in case you get anxiety. Some people say this is dangerous, I beg to differ... Valium is used in Hospitals for Stimulant overdoses (To calm the patient down). Benzos have little effect on BP, so it&#039;s perfectly safe. <br />

I am prescribed vyvanse regularly and every time I ask if that combination is ok and a every time an doctor has told me that it is, assuming reasonable doses. THey didn&#039;t even say that part, but I am.<br /><br />I have had benzo WD is pretty much the worst thing imaginable. I had about 5 solid days of xanax WD from only using/abusing xanax daily for about a month and a half. Talk about proceeding with caution, benzos are sneaky little bastards, but when used occasionally are pretty great. Pure relief from whatever ales you (anxiety, insomnia, hangover, too much stimulants/stimulant comedown, other drug WD etc.).&nbsp; But when I was having that xanax WD, it was like I was having a pnic attack 24/7. THe insomia was absolutely fucking rediculous, and you body just feels horrible, its really the worst and ive had Alc WD which comes in #2 for me and Opiate WD twice, but both cases were very mild (like 24 hours or less). SO I can&#039;t really speak on hardcore opiate WD, and I never want to be able to. But DONT TAKE BENZOS EVERYDAY!!! I can&#039;t stress that enough. I suppose the same goes for opiates unless you have severe chronic pain.<br /><br />I should add that during that 5 days of hellish xanax WD, on the first day I was able to get two 2mg kolonipin from a friend and broke them up into 4 pieces each (eight .5mg pieces) and took one in the morning and one at night before trying to sleep. THat fucking saved my life, I would have most likely had to go to the hospital if not for that.
