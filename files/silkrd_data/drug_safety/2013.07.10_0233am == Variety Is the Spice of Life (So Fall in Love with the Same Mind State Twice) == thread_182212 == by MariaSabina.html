				I think it&#039;s easy to forget how important it is not to keep going back to the same well even after it&#039;s run dry, or to go only to that well and forget that one needs to go to the baker and candlestick maker also.<br /><br />I see this over and over with MDMA use.&nbsp; So many people talk about how their first time or their first few times produced a sort of Shulgin plus four and they&#039;ll never feel that way again.&nbsp; Loss of magic is, at this point, a well-known phenomenon, so why are we trying to get into the same state of satori with our 50th pill as we were able to with our first few?&nbsp; What we&#039;ve forgotten is that it&#039;s not the E itself -- the E is a tool to awaken our mind into a beautiful state of transcendence.<br /><br />But there are many ways to get there.<br /><br />Maybe take the E during the day with your boyfriend and go strolling through the meadows, instead of just caning a bunch of pills out clubbing or raving.<br /><br />Maybe take a good break from the E and try something new: mushrooms on a beach with the sun setting, sacred cactus in a cabin with the snow falling, or acid in the desert with the sun rising.<br /><br />Also, there&#039;s a reason some people call GHB &quot;liquid E.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, in the spirit of harm reduction, let me say that GHB is very dose sensitive and there can be serious danger combining it with other psychoactives.&nbsp; The difference between a heavy dose of G (around 2.5+ g) which leads to a gorgeous, empathic love of the universe, yourself, and everybody around you ... and nausea or vomiting can be, according to Erowid, 250 mg.&nbsp; Un-rouseable sleep or overdose could be around 3 - 5 g.&nbsp; Poisoning, with risk of death, can be 10+ g.&nbsp; Try to mix it with alcohol or K or something like that, and you can !really! increase the risk of overdose.&nbsp; So, like the Wu-Tang, GHB ain&#039;t nothin&#039; to fuck with.&nbsp; But used responsibility, it can be a gorgeous companion.&nbsp; <br /><br />So do your research, be cautious experimenting, and pack your bags!&nbsp; You might just find yourself again in a state that you thought had barred you from entry, but in reality, you just needed to find a new place to get a visa and a new place to cross the border.&nbsp; (This is in no way an endorsement of the State, as in Nation State, btw).&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to develop a relationship with these substances, which I&#039;d prefer to think of as entities.&nbsp; We don&#039;t know much about consciousness, but it&#039;s quite possible that it exists in some way even at the level of molecules, atoms, and energies.&nbsp; So what&#039;s wrong with starting small, getting to make some small talk, and seeing how you get along?&nbsp; Maybe hang out a few times.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to sleep with it on the first date.&nbsp; Maybe you tried a heavy dose of something once and had a bad trip.&nbsp; But maybe that was too much, too fast.&nbsp; Or you tried a small amount and didn&#039;t like it.&nbsp; But hey, first impressions, while important, aren&#039;t everything.&nbsp; And sometimes we aren&#039;t in the right mood to hang out with a particular chemical.&nbsp; Or maybe it&#039;s not in the mood.&nbsp; Then again, especially with a substance where there&#039;s very little (or almost no) risk of overdosing, maybe going whole hog because you really want to get to know it deeply and quickly is the way to go.<br /><br />Sometimes friends fight because they&#039;re hanging out too much.&nbsp; Sometimes you meet somebody and it&#039;s so magical at first, but later you get bored with her and have no interest in exploring what&#039;s under her surface.&nbsp; Or maybe you meet someone you don&#039;t like very much at first, but then later you become good friends.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s the same thing with chemicals.<br /><br />And as much as I love entheogens, empathogens, and maybe a pharm or two, it&#039;s important to realize that drugs are !tools! and can !definitely! be part of the answers you&#039;re seeking, but they&#039;re not a panacea.&nbsp; People can do some not so good things or get confused about the ideas they learn under the influence of them.&nbsp; Maybe sometimes it&#039;s time to take a break from them altogether.&nbsp; Then we&#039;re back to the questions of use vs. abuse.&nbsp; And when we consider all types of drugs, maybe some are just plain not very good for some, or even most, people.&nbsp; Now we&#039;re back to the question of personal freedom and the ability to experiment.<br /><br />And most importantly, meaningful work, meditation, exercise, relaxation, sports, martial arts, gardening, making music, watching movies, going to parties, kicking it in the crib, hanging with friends, spending time alone, etc. ... whatever you&#039;re into that makes your life meaningful ... all those experiences and activities are so important ... so we can recognize the divinity within ourselves and others (whether we&#039;re high while doing them or not, lol).<br /><br />It&#039;s so sad that so many of us live in a society that fills our life with a shit job we really hate and shit passive entertainment that really bores us.&nbsp; And we basically have only a few legal drugs, namely, things like alcohol and caffeine, which may have their place in moderation, but are only a very small sample of the ways in which one can alter one&#039;s consciousness.&nbsp; Alcohol can be highly addictive, make people very dumb and selfish, and really cause a lot of destruction to the user and those around him.&nbsp; And caffeine can also be addictive, make people very jittery and impatient, and allow us to do all sorts of work we&#039;d never want to if we had our druthers.<br /><br />We don&#039;t ever have time to stop and think about what we want and need, what our loved ones want or need, and what we can do to really live life and not just be surviving, rushing around, in a hurry to get to the next thing that&#039;s going to make us experience even !more! suffering than just the basic difficulties that being a human being entails (birth, sickness, old age, and death).<br /><br />But the Road is helping change all that.&nbsp; And all youse out there who are a part of this, who are a part of BTC, who are a part of sustainable living efforts, who are a part of achieving greater autonomy in government, and who are a part of all kinds of new ways of living are helping change that.<br /><br />Maybe our post-mammalian (advanced primate) bodies and minds can adapt to this post-industrial (advanced technological) world in a way that is beautiful, instead of failing to evolve and ending up in a 1984/Bladerunner/Metropolis-like dystopia (or something even worse).
