				The people that live near me take them with alcohol. They say the feel invincible, can do anything. Reduced inhibitions. A bit of a buzz. Forget the night (is that a good thing)?<br /><br />I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever felt like that. Or even felt a buzz. I take a high dose to come down from various things. Mostly end up a sleep or extremely sedated so I don&#039;t care about anything.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised you&#039;re on them long term zvp1014. Generally they try to get you away from benzos for stuff like that. Did you try other things like mild antidepressants or CBT or anything? I have a bit of experience for personal reasons.

				I dunno.<br /><br />I got a script for them, and my inner druggie was like &quot;woah these are gonna get me fucked up.&quot;&nbsp; I noticed nothing aside from a realm calming effect that I needed for anxiety anyway.&nbsp; I have never gotten a &quot;high&quot; off a benzo. Given how fucking awful withdrawls are, I much rather do something that gives me a real high, like weed or opiates

				People take benzo&#039;s for a very wide variety of situations. <br /><br />The primary one is to cope, to function, to reduce irrational anxieties and such. This is bascially what the less-narcotic benzo&#039;s like xsanax were developed to do, and they often do this very well.<br /><br />Another major application is as hypnotics, i.e. sleep aids, for which other benzo&#039;s prove quite effective in the short term, though tolerance usually developes quickly, making it only a temporary fix.<br /><br />Lastly there is the strictly recreational use, where people take large doses of things like xanax to produce a feeling comparable to alcohol intoxication. This is not very common though since in most places alcohol is more readily and cheaply available. <br /><br />Combination use is another thing entirely though: substances like xanax can be used to &#039;cancel&#039; bad trips in many cases. People using psychedelics like lsd often keep some benzo&#039;s at hand in case their trip turns bad to have a way of stopping that and dozing off for a bit instead of riding out a negative experience.

				Pure benzo&#039;s surely are not tasteless. Xanax is rather bitter, both as a pure powder and as a tablet if you decide to chew on it, and the taste really is rather foul. You may have positive associations with it that make it acceptable, but the basic taste is nasty. <br /><br />Diazepam is also a bit bitter, but somehow not in a negative way to me - the taste doesn&#039;t seem to linger very long compared to xanax. <br /><br />Clonazepam is a bit odd here, since its often offered in tablets with some added flavour like mint or banana. I dount straight clonazepam will taste very good, but i&#039;d have to go to the point of extracting it from tablets to find out. <br />

				Xanax is pretty good for come-downs, IMO.... Or just to take the &quot;edge&quot; off of all stimulants. <br /><br />I do have a prescription for it. <br />While I do not have social anxiety, it makes everything much more manageable for me. <br />Some people take xanax and pass out; I take xanax and clean the house, pay bills, etc. <br />Makes it way easier to sort my tasks out and think straight. <br />Also if I fight with my boyfriend I might pop a xanax and it helps me act like I don&#039;t give a fuck. Haha. <br /><br />Seroquel isn&#039;t a benzo- but if we&#039;re on that topic, last time I took seroquel I fell asleep for around 30 hours and missed my flight. It also made my arms and legs swell up. No love for seroquel. I&#039;m sticking to xanax.&nbsp; :-\

				It&#039;s weird seroquel is actually sought after in jail. It must&#039;ve been good for you I guess.. <br />Is it true people get raped in jail? I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s some sort of exaggeration or if people actually get raped as much as they say they do.

				Seroquel works better as a sleep aid at 25-150mg dosages. Get higher and it becomes more antipsychotic. People take upwards of 600mg Seroquel sometimes. It&#039;s not really much more sedating than 100mg.<br /><br />Seroquel is pretty crappy in my opinion though. I hate it. I only take it if I&#039;m running low on Valium (which I almost never am).

				I suppose seroquel is one of those drugs that really affect people differently. For some a low dose (25/50mg) seems to be a very effective hyptonic, where others experience little effect at all. <br /><br />Personally i find a nice dose of benzo&#039;s to do the job just fine, but everyone is different and for some benzo&#039;s don&#039;t seem to do much at all while seroquel knocks them straight out.
