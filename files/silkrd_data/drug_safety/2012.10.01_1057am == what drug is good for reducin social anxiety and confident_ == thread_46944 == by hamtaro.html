				A lot of stimulants such as Meth and Adderall will give you a lot of confidence, a strong sense of euphoria, and will make you very talkative, but the come downs can be very harsh and make you even more anti-social after the drug wears off.<br /><br />Others may suggest MDMA which is also a stimulant, but the comedown isn&#039;t nearly as harsh....<br /><br />I personally have found that GHB provides a strong sense of euphoria, producing a lot of confidence, an overall general happy feeling which usually makes me very talkative and social. However; you have to get the dose just right with GHB because if you take too much you will just pass out.

				What&#039;s called &quot;Smart Drugs&quot; are legal in most parts of the world and generally quite affordable, (compared to S.R wares- lol). Check out cerebralhealth.com for all your cognitive enhancer needs. I use a regiment of Piracetam and Choline and recommend them highly. Also, command yourself to get out there and start interacting with happy looking people. Ask them where the library is or talk about the weather, anything light and friendly. Face/ embrace the fear and you will overcome it. Always maintain friendly eye contact when conversing. Been there myself when I was younger. The few friends I did have called me a &quot;shut-in&quot; because I never wanted to do anything but sit at home and be miserable. Weed just made it worse. Now my problem is everywhere I go people are drawn to me like ants to honey due to my smiling, radiating confidence. Hope this helps ya.<br /><br />Tat

				Cocaine but don&#039;t do to much or you will become overly confident and just act like an asshole.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend xanax, not sure how it effects everyone but my first time I pretty much just blacked out and woke up the next morning feeling like a zombie.

				Doesn&#039;t alcohol sort your social anxiety and confidence issues?<br /><br />Small amount of MDMA would go nicely but don&#039;t combine too much Alcohol with it.<br /><br />Goldust

				To be honest if you suffer from anxiety and low confidence you would be better off not taking any drugs.<br /><br />If you take drugs for this purpose you will end up being unable to interact unless your high.<br /><br />Get more exercise and make more of an effort to interact with other people maybe join a club.

Valium. Or like he said, natural self-esteem, there any various ways to achieve that. None of which are drug related.<br /><br />Never uppers to treat &#039;social ANXIETY&#039; uppers are gonna eventually exacerbate anxiety, most likely anyway. I&#039;m prescribed Vyvanse, I also dont have social anxiety just the regular kind, with unknown causes im plenty social. But yeah, Valium. But you should probably see a good shrink and maybe they can help in a natural way and if necessary give you some medicinal assistance.&nbsp; Sure is shit ain&#039;t gonna be adderall or MDMA hah.

				Moclobemide!! Just dont ever take it with MDMA/Amphetamine/Cocaine/most recreational drugs or you&#039;ll end up in intensive care.. <br />Gives you great euphoria and great for social anxiety, lots of energy, bliss (warning aside it actually is really good for social anxiety)<br /><br />Atomexetine gives you great euphoria but also can make you a little sweaty <br /><br />Hydroxyzine is really good for mild anxiety but makes you a bit sleepy<br /><br />Methoxetamine is amazeballs for these problems but dissociatives are not a good idea for regular use and may make you a bit odd if you have more than 15mg, maybe for parties?<br /><br />MDMA is great for occasional but useless for longterm use, maybe using it will help you get over your anxiety completely. the comfort it brings will allow you to experience a temporary state of self acceptance, which may carry on to sobriety.<br /><br />Valium would make you sleepy and i dont think it&#039;s particularly constructive to overcoming social anxiety. however would remove the anxiety completely. <br /><br />And you can never beat a good dose of amphetamine.. but may make you anxious. keep doses to 20mg or less

If it&#039;s already at the point where he&#039;s not interacting with anyone and doesn&#039;t want to leave the house then it can&#039;t get any worse, can it? And you don&#039;t have to take drugs to become this way. I had severe social anxiety way before I ever took any drug. Ever since kindergarten I was the quiet kid in class that never spoke a word to anyone.<br /><br />I was at this point and yes drugs did help. The only problem is when I&#039;m sober I go back to being the way I was. So it is only a temporary fix. Where it gets dangerous is when people think they can take drugs everyday to fix the problem. Obviously this will lead to addiction, physical dependence and high tolerance to the drug of choice. <br /><br />So what do I do? I accept the fact that I can&#039;t be the person I want to be all the time. Most days I have to go alone and only use something when I really need it. <br /><br />Benzos help the most to take away social anxiety but speed will give you more energy, motivation euphoria and it&#039;ll keep you awake . I don&#039;t feel that it works as well in taking away my anxiety but it does help some.

				Yeah I mean, I am prescribed Vyvanse (XR Dexamph) and have been scribed valium, k pin, whatever for short periods of time and docs always said it was fine to combine. I agree that is pretty killer if youre goin for a temporary chemical solution.

				The best tools I have used for this are both completely legal where I am.&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Kava-Kava (try kona kava farms&#039; 84% extract/paste)<br />2. Kratom<br /><br />Small to moderate doses of Kratom make me super confident and talkative.&nbsp; Too much will sedate however, which you don&#039;t want.<br /><br />Kava-Kava has been helpful in easing the come-up on psychedelics, and is well known for its anti-anxiety effect.
