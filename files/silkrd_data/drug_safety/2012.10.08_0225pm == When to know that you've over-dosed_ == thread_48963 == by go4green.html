				Hello,<br /><br />I was just wondering at what stage you would consider that your life is in danger and you&#039;d need medical intervention ASAP?<br /><br />I had an experience last year where I thought that I was dying! <br />I couldn&#039;t breathe, I couldn&#039;t see, I had ringing in my ears, I couldn&#039;t move a single muscle, including my tongue, so I couldn&#039;t even speak with the operator on the phone. and I had the worst headache and dizziness anyone can imagine.<br /><br />I was taken to the ER. Given my past history of severe depression, it was considered as a suicide// self-harm attempted, and was admitted to psych unit. <br /><br /><br />However, <br />I did NOT need any intervention other than laying down in the ER for some hours!<br /><br /><br />So, I was wondering if it was kinda early for me to make that call ?? <br />since I did not need any treatments of any sort. Maybe should&#039;ve just rested in my bed&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Long story short,<br />What makes you believe that a moment is THE moment you should make the call.<br /><br /><br /><br />plz ignore spilling/ grammar. ... I may have OD&#039;ed LOL. :D

				u know u die. when u hit the floor... when u think u can make it to the phone.. but not even...<br /><br />or when u see yourself turning white from lack of oxygen.. its a serious call for help..<br /><br />with weed. i seen people faint.. but unless u really messin around with death. then u got nothing to worry about...<br /><br /><br />i hear heart attacks are not even noticable.. thing about death is you never know how u goin out.. but most importantly<br /><br />natural ways of dieing are alot better than any purposely caused ones

				You shouldn&#039;t overdose in the first place. Drugs are fun as long as you control them not the other way around.<br /><br />Most people realize they overdosed after they die so good luck with that.

				^ death is the answer.<br />and you should always be using your &quot;drug of choice&quot; with sincere moderation.<br />why do you think the &quot;big brother&quot; wants to control the shit? because people like this die, every day. every day. every day. every day.<br /><br />OD&#039;s serious. half of the time.. you don&#039;t know you&#039;re gonna OD until you&#039;re asleep, and well, then it&#039;s obviously too late.<br /><br />be careful op.<br /><br /><br />/thumbs

				if you&#039;ve overdosed you&#039;re consciousness will be so altered that you may not be aware of it till it&#039;s too late...<br />you need a sitter that&#039;s well educated and knowledgeable in the medical field to check your vital signs and make sure they&#039;re within reasonable limits...<br /><br />in the case of using prescription drugs recreationally....taking anything over the prescribed dose is considered overdosing...so if you&#039;re having fun, you&#039;ve already ODed....

				I&#039;ve only ever over dosed once, and I don&#039;t remember overdosing at all. <br /><br />I highly doubt you&#039;ll be able to tell, I suppose it could be possible...

				Depends on your body. For me, at that moment just when I am about to enter &quot;sleep&quot; my breathing goes from slowing down to completely stopping as I enter sleep and I fly up gasping for air. But most a lot of people aren&#039;t that lucky and fall asleep and stop breathing immediately.

				Look i hate these threads because they scare the shit out of me since losing to friends to OD&#039;ing.&nbsp; Just always start out very small and conservative with your dose. If you&#039;ve never done it before don&#039;t do it alone and have someone who is level headed and knows what they&#039;re doing with you so you don&#039;t OD out of ignorance of the substance.&nbsp; You can always take a little more to get you where you want to be but you can&#039;t suck that shit out of your body once its there so be cautious.&nbsp; I just want people to enjoy what they want to safely and responsibly
