				Title: <strong>Question about DMT</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>AncientX</strong> on <strong>June 07, 2012, 12:07 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				So, ive been wanting to try dmt for a little while now, since i joined the SR community.<br /><br />And, i have had prior experience with it before, but only 1 little scary mishap.<br /><br />Once, i got a new weed pipe from a friend, it was caked in resin, and i was out of any actual bud ( i was like 15-16 at the time )<br /><br />Well, he mentioned to my brother he use to smoke DMT out of it, and i&#039;ve never had any experience with dmt, or anything.<br /><br />A few hours pass by, and i clean the pipe, and smoke a bowl of some funky smelling/tasting resin. But it gets me stoned.<br /><br />Once i finish the bowl, my mom had asked me to run to the grocery store, about a block away.<br /><br />So, 20 minutes pass, and im paying for some groceries, when all of a sudden, all i can see is this mango and redish hue everywhere, my vision is completely blurred,&nbsp; and i can hardly understand any of the sounds around me, i stood there for about 3 -5 minutes, just paralyzed, i couldnt speak, or move. I was just frozen, while my vision kalidoscoped. Well it wears away, and i snap to, and the cashier is looking at me like &quot; Wtf.....is this kid okay? &quot; She asks if im okay, i just shrug it off and say i got light headed, and quickly head back home, wondering what the fuck had just happened to me.<br /><br /><br />Well, fast forward 5 years to now, im much wiser, and more experience with psychedelics, and think im ready to give REAL legitimate, DMT a shot.<br /><br />From what ive heard and read, its a life changing experience. <br /><br />Can anyone tell me what its like, is their a high they can compare it to?<br /><br />Is it dangerous?<br /><br />Is it safe to do in a locked room by myself? <br /><br />I just wanna know everything i can before i commit to buying it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really have anyone to test it with me, or babysit me for the experience, otherwise i wouldnt really be so cautious.

				No, it&#039;s not even remotely dangerous; you&#039;ve had firsthand experience of like the worst that can happen to you which is to be in a very public place and have the effects hit you. It&#039;s safe to do it by yourself if you know yourself well enough, it might make you yell like OH MY GOOOOOOOOOD ITS REALLLL FUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKING AMAAAAAAAAZZINNGGG at the top of your lungs (no joke) so you might want to make sure the house is empty and not just your room. <br /><br />The only high I can compare to is Salvia, which is like being completely taken out of your body and being switched realities/dimensions. It&#039;s extremely intense but also just as euphoric. If you smoke pure DMT it&#039;s like going on a rollercoaster for the very first time, where you won&#039;t know what&#039;s going to happen and then BAAAM you&#039;re going down 100mph seeing the most incredible shit and feeling amazing but you don&#039;t know where to concentrate because it&#039;s all happening so quick. <br /><br />But if you smoke Changa, it&#039;s a lot more controllable plus you can extend the trip as long as you keep smoking. It also doesn&#039;t taste as bitter. <br /><br />Good luck, it&#039;s one hell of a ride.&nbsp;

				Thank you for the info. <br /><br />But that brings up another question, What are the side effects of DMT? <br />Are there any adverse health effects.<br />I heard from a friend that intense hallucinogens can cause brain bubbles, or even seizures. <br /><br />I&#039;ve dont plenty of E, LSD, Mushrooms, Salvia, so im no stranger to hallucinogens, but i never push my luck by increasing the dosage than what i know my body can handle.<br />

				From what&#039;s reported there are no reported side effects other than nausea or headaches from being overwhelmed from the visuals. Tribes have been using this stuff safely for hundreds of years so I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much. Nobody has ever heard of an OD from DMT. Studies show that the usage of Ayahuasca keeps your brain healthier than not using it.

It&#039;s so incredibly intense that you forget your entire identity and even the fact that you&#039;ve smoked the plant, but you&#039;re thrown into some new reality with no knowledge of yourself and no reference point to anything but the infinite. Extremely intense to say the least. <br /><br />DMT lasts about 5-10 mins at the most where at a peak of a breakthrough you&#039;re having conversations with alien lifeforces showing you 4-D gifts and trying to teach you how to do celestial tricks with your spirit body. And the come down is another 10 mins where you&#039;re back in a human body but still feeling extreme euphoria and slowly the CEVs and OEVs evaporate. <br /><br />Changa lasts 15-20mins and takes a bit more to breakthrough but it&#039;s a lot less intense and controllable and you can extend the trip to even 2 hours as long as you keep smoking it. <br /><br />All I can say is, don&#039;t give be in awe, &quot;Don&#039;t give in to astonishment&quot; as Terrence Mckenna once said. You&#039;re just a witness to this extraordinary event and as long as you keep calm, you&#039;ll be shown the most amazing things the universe can offer. Easier said than done, especially on your first try!&nbsp; <br /><br />DMT Nexus has a good lexicon of all the different terms, and descriptions of common astral beings you can meet. <br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Hyperspace_lexicon</code><br />

				Breaking through on DMT is one of the most intense and interesting experiences out there. I&#039;ve only met an entity so clearly defined with DMT. It was a blue child-like creature who appeared to the right and started screaming out til my ears were filled with a loud pitch.

Set and setting (internal&amp;external) are extremely important. Be in a safe and relaxing place with no chance of someone wandering nearby. Eliminate any distractions, you&#039;ll want to be able to completely forget and let go of this world. I&#039;ve had a few trips where I&#039;ve opened my eyes thinking &quot;someone might be coming&quot; which really puts a hamper on the experience. On that note, I always try to keep my eyes closed as long as possible. Opening them once the peak of the trip finishes is nice -- the world looks finely polished and everything seems.. bigger, extra-dimensional -- but I enjoy keeping them closed as it prolongs the visions. Always respect DMT. Submit to it. Listen to it. Learn from it.<br /><br />So, backtracking, first have a comfortable set and setting. Somewhere to lean back or lie down on some pillows will be necessary. Wear some comfortable clothes or no clothing as you might not even have a body in hyperspace. I find that slowing my breathing down improves the quality of my trip and helps me progress to deeper levels of hyperspace. Take large hits and hold each for 10-15 seconds. I still feel the effects of a hit of DMT building at 15seconds, but stop there to take the next hit. I know I&#039;m ready for hyperspace when: A) I&#039;m already there. B) I&#039;m falling backwards onto the cushion of pillows. C) Audible noises (dmt tone, trees in the wind, etc) begin getting louder, and louder, drowning everything else out. D) I didn&#039;t hit enough for hyperspace but close my eyes to visit &#039;in-between&#039;<br /><br />I also prepare pre-trip for items and activities I&#039;ll want post-trip, or on the come-down. Speakers are set up with music ready to be selected (I enjoy music post-trip, not during-trip unless I&#039;m fucking around), glass of water, a smoke, a mirror for self-reflection is interesting as well. The come-down from a DMT trip is beautiful! I frequently say &quot;holy shit!&quot; and similar statements, my body feels relaxed as ever, I say &quot;holy shit!&quot; again when I look at a clock, feel very happy and lucky to alive and to experience this, and all that jazz. With how fundamentally different hyperspace is I think it really gives me a better understanding of just what makes up reality, and then I enjoy those little things.<br /><br /><br />It can certainly be life-changing. In what way? I&#039;m not exactly sure. DMT raises lots of questions, and I love questions. It also paves the way for a few answers, but requires me to do the footwork. If I&#039;m not using it to seek a better understanding, it certainly still has a use as a psychic rollercoaster.<br /><br />With Pure D my breakthroughs are usually under around or under 10 minutes, with the come-down lasting maybe 20-30 minutes. I am back to a relative baseline at 30m-1hr from initial dosing. However, I notice that my sense of time is a bit off for the rest of the day, with each hour seeming to take longer than usual. After one of my more profound and deep trips, I had an afterglow that lasted well over a month. Subjectively I&#039;ve noticed their is a decent increase in introspection in the days after a DMT trip.<br /><br />Breakthroughs feel hyper-real, if you can imagine it.<br /><br />Short on time, but here is further reading I&#039;ve enjoyed and a link to a thread on the nexus that has loads of scientific research on DMT/aya<br />http://www.serendipity.li/dmt/weebit2.pdf<br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=1441

				Thanks for that!, definitely answered some questions.<br /><br />But it raises a few more. You said it puts a hamper on the experience when someone is nearby, or lurking. ( assuming that its somone who doesnt know your 9 clouds away from earth lol )<br /><br />How easy is it to determine reality from the DMT hallucinations? Like...for example.<br /><br />Im going to be in my room, and my mom never comes down there, But she sometimes calls for me to come answer a computer question, or let me know something is going on in the weekly schedule of things. <br />I want to be able to quietly,&nbsp; enjoy my DMT experience, while the threat of wandering person is around. ( not my choice, she just never fucking goes anywhere cause shes retired )

				Ah I suppose there&#039;s a few things I could clear up in that regard. It is such a full experience I never know quite where to begin.<br /><br />I was referencing more of a semi-private location with possible unknowns.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been disturbed mid-trip by a friend and it doesn&#039;t really ruin the entire experience, just stops it in its tracks. I was glowing, smile smacked across my face, sputtering whatever words I thought fit what I saw so I could try to remember it all. Everyday questions were impossible for a few minutes, I can&#039;t imagine trying to pay attention to a weekly schedule. But so long as she can wait a few minutes for a response or functionality I think you may be alright.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How easy is it to determine reality from the DMT hallucinations?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>A breakthrough, to me, is when enough is smoked to see (eyes closed, usually) only the DMT hallucinations and enter the vivid world to meet its inhabitants.<br />Before that is an overlay of psychedelic visuals and the color tinting you mentioned in your original post. Sometimes entities will appear surrounding me here in our reality, however I have not attempted to engage with them.<br />Personally I&#039;ve found it easy until I truly let go and break through. Some trips will seem and look like a full-on breakthrough but I&#039;m still fully aware of my body and surroundings. Then there are the trips where it&#039;s &quot;lights out, Earth&quot; and you are fully emerged into hyperspace.<br /><br />One of the (many) things that surprised me about DMT was how clear-headed and focused I feel while tripping. The focus is purely on the moment and its details. I&#039;m fully aware and cognitive, but it&#039;s as if&nbsp; my attention is payed almost exclusively to whatever visuals I might be seeing. Or perhaps that my visuals are a product of my thought and attention, a movie of the mind. Who knows, I hallucinate everything so reality is what I make of it.

				Thanks for clearing that up. I think i may wait....I know 100% i will try it....but i believe something is coming up soon, as to where i&#039;ll be able to be completely alone for the experience. Which is what i would prefer.<br /><br />haha, i like how you ended that. &quot; I hallucinate everything, so reality is what i make it &quot; <br /><br />Very true words.

				After trying DMT in many different forms. I believe that worst thing that can happen is a case PTSD. Which can happen with any psychedelic.<br /><br />For an example of DMT induced PTSD, one can look up what happened to Neal Cassady when Timothy Leary gave him some during the infamous meeting between the merry pranksters and timothy leary&#039;s group. there is a good account of it in Tom Wolfe&#039;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;<br /><br />Aside from a freak accident like that.

There are just too many simple options out there (like the DMT Machine) to use a standard pipe. However, if you do use a pipe be sure to place a number of screens in the bowl so the DMT doesn&#039;t just melt and fall down into the pipe before vaporizing.

If you break through, you&#039;ll most likely either stop hearing the music or the music will become integral in a way that isn&#039;t really about the music itself. You can&#039;t really predict that ahead of time, but either way it&#039;ll be right.<br /><br />(That happened to my girlfriend on salvia the other day -- we were at a burn, so there was heavy dubstep music playing most of the time.&nbsp; She started hearing her name in the beat of the music, and then she BECAME the music, and started thinking the person she remembered being was just made up in a song. Then she thought &quot;Who am I?&quot; and concluded that she must be whoever was making the song, but couldn&#039;t remember anything about herself.&nbsp; When she came out of it, she called me and her other boyfriend into the tent for assurance that she remembered her name correctly and that she was real.)

				The music thing all depends on how you feel about the music you choose and your feelings about music in general.<br /><br />If you are the type of person that doesn&#039;t care about music beyond its novelty as a form of entertainment (like most ignorant kids that like whatever MTV and radio tells them to like now-a-days) than you will get about as much out of listening to music on DMT as you would from trying to watch your favorite sitcom on it (not much)<br /><br />If you are passionate about music and/or are an advanced/classical musician who cares deeply about such things on many emotional and intellectual levels (like myself) than the right piece of music (which has a sincere emotional value to yourself) can help you to have a powerful, one-of-a-kind, transcendental experience.<br />If you fall into this group, than I would suggest that you try listening to a slower but emotionally powerful (to you) piece. Like a ballad or a love song or even better (IMHO) a softer classical piece. You could always listen to something hardcore and aggressive as well but this could affect you trip quite negatively if you aren&#039;t careful. However, I have had some epically profound trips on DMT while listening to Beethoven&#039;s Presto Agitato (3rd movement of moonlight sonata.....Its like the classical/romantic period equivalent of a heavy metal piece)<br /><br />I personally have acquired the ritual of listening to Vladamir Horowitz&#039;s 1952 Carnegie Hall recording of Hungarian Rhapsody #2 by Franz Liszt when I smoke DMT (it has to be that specific recording for me now).<br />I turn it on and let the first part of the music prepare my mind me for my journey to the beyond and light up the pipe at the 2-3 minute mark when it starts to speed up. And I try to get at least 3 big hits to make sure I break through. If I come back to reality and it is still playing than I stumble for the pipe and take another good toke to get back into outerspace for the rest of the song.<br /><br />THE EXPERIENCE: <br /><br />[The following is one of many personal experiences that I long kept to myself, awaiting for the proper time to share it with a community such as this]<br /><br />&nbsp;As the DMT comes on, this once rigid piece that I know by know by heart begins to&nbsp; change shape....expanding and contracting.....undergoing a transformation until it becomes a wholly alien sound that I no longer recognize intellectually but can still somehow understand on at least an emotional level.......<br />Then ......all of the sudden........BANG!!!!<br /><br />I am quite suddenly on or in an astral plane that consists entirely of the sum and difference frequencies of the tones, pitches and harmonics...... beating dissonantly against one another in the way that only 12 tone Equal Temperament can, while simultaneously managing to coalesce as a single, harmonious, sonic entity.......<br />I become the strings, the felts, the keys, the hammers.....I am the piano and the Piano is me.....the tinkling notes of the upper octaves create a blanket of multidimensional stars above me, while the thundering bass notes transform into the ground on which I rest my weary metaphysical head.....it undulates powerfully beneath me like a rough tide in the middle of the ocean and yet remains firm, keeping my head afloat the cascade of raw emotions that lie just beneath the surface. I watch the Big Bang of creation unfold in the heavens before my very eyes for an eternity of infinitesimal duration.....I avert my eyes for fear of being blinded by this universal beauty only to discover that&nbsp; one of the DMT elves has appeared at my feet and is trying to distract me from the profundity of my experience with some superficial device of intricate design..... but it ultimately seems to have little meaning in the grander scheme of things......I decide to Ignore him this time and take the plunge into the 11th dimension, instead of attempting communication with this often-sighted creature of unknown origin (which always seems to be a fruitless endeavor with those bastards anyways.....no matter how hard you try).....<br /><br />So I let my self be absorbed into the ground.....which suddenly seems to ascend high above me at such a speed that I no longer know If I am falling or it is rising.........no matter.....it is soon forgotten and no longer visible or of importance......I look around into the seemingly empty void of kaleidoscopic wonder, feeling lost and utterly alone.....when all of the sudden I am assaulted by a barrage of long forgotten, ancient, knowledge that precedes time itself......revelations become apparent, as if they were always known to me, in the blink of an eye....The true meaning and overlooked purpose of the cosmological constant becomes apparent (along with many other things which cannot be recalled in my human form) ....... as I realize the importance and truth of these revelations I become a being of pure ecstasy. Elated with the false belief that i can bring this knowledge back to human race....But then it becomes apparent that I can not bring this knowledge back with me due to the inherent restrictions of my 3rd dimensional body and I shed a tear for this loss to mankind.....knowing what could be....if only........if only........(i can not describe or concisely remember this sentiment in human words)<br /><br />As the tear falls from my face, my perception is suddenly switched to that of the tear.....and Innocent speck of nothingness falling to its doom below.......I accept my fate and embrace the end that is to come......But as I hit what I first assumed would be ground I am filled with shock and to realize that it is the emotional ocean of before and no matter how hard i struggle to keep my individual atoms together as a single entity amidst the torrent, my being is quickly assimilated by the waters of Cthulhu.......after a short struggle I accept the futility of my attempts to remain a separate entity from these seemingly mirthless waters....and in that instance of acceptance my consciousness is permeated thoughout the entire ocean until the division between me and it ceases be relevant and there is know only we...and we are one......I spend what feels like an eternity adrift in this purgatory. wondering if/when/how I will get back to my former self.....for some reason, the implications of being stuck in this place no longer seem to bother me at all and as I reflect upon my journeys, I notice a faint sound far off in the distance.....foreign yet somehow familiar.....I than sense that the once steady rhythm of the tide is growing faster and stronger and then the once far off sound is becoming closer to me and more aggressive....and more familiar......and one of the stars in the sky is also becoming brighter and larger with every second......as everything is speeding up, the very fabric of this world that I have grown accustomed too seems to be fading away....to be replaced by what (if anything)? I don&#039;t know......<br />My previous complacency is quickly becoming replaced by a panic akin to that of a surfer being carried off into the great unknown by a powerful rip-tide and the sound is now a deafening roar that is becoming all the more familiar...somehow.... while the light of the ever-growing star is seeking to engulf my entire vision.....<br />........But wait....... could it be............YES..........That is a music instrument i hear.............Yes..........a stringed instrument.......A...........Piano!!!!!!<br />And in that last moment...... the final chords of Hungarian rhapsody are struck with a fierceness that only Horowitz could accomplish. And those very same chords shoot me back into my human body which is sprawled on the couch gazing into the 100watt light-bulb affixed to my ceiling fan....<br /><br />In that moment of return to reality, I am so overjoyed that I leap from couch, knocking over a bottle of rum and scream .....SHORE!!!!! at the top of my lungs.<br /><br />I quickly realize that I am still disoriented from the trip and that I have a GIGANTIC FUCKING PURPLE DOT in the center of my vision, Which I imagine is from my mindless body staring at the lightbulb for an extended portion of my trip.<br /><br />So I pick up the bottle of rum and gulp down the last bit that didn&#039;t spill. Light up a cigarette and spend the next hour or so musing about my experience in the afterglow......... I have never been quite the same since this particular trip and to quote Martha Stewart.....&quot;It&#039;s a good thing&quot;<br />

				Sounds like two are DMT pills and two are MAOI pills. Take the MAOI pills (likely the colored ones??) 30-60 minutes before dosing the DMT pills.

SR vendor trojan has a really cool combo pack where you can get a gram of changa, half a gram of pure DMT and half a gram of Jungle spice at a very decent price. His shit is absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />In terms of effects pure DMT is like being shot into the sky and then freefalling without a parachute, Changa is like having a magic carpet which guides you gently through the entire journey.
