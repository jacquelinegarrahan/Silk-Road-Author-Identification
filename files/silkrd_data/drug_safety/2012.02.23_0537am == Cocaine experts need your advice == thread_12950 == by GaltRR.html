				So I have done it a few times but it was always in powder form and I just did the line. I never had to break it up and make the lines. But here is my question; I ordered .5g from HM last week and what I got wasn&#039;t a powder. It had been extremely compressed, and the best description I can use is that it was a small malleable sheet of cocaine. It broke when it was bent and I was able to break it into a white powder. It wasnt in a soft rock that I expected. It has the same smell of the previous cocaine I have tried but a lot stronger. Before I do this with a friend I just want to make sure I got cocaine and not crack cocaine or something else.

				You got cocaine my friend.<br />You got good cocaine.<br />If it were crack-cocaine then it wouldn&#039;t have nearly as good of a kick up the nose due to the inactive ingredients.<br /><br />I think you&#039;re safe to try with a friend :)<br /><br />have fun with my girl Christina

				Good coke is rocky and solid like that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Crack that I&#039;ve seen/had has been a powder, and salty tasting.<br /><br />Have fun with that yummy shit.&nbsp; Let us know how it goes.&nbsp; Do a smaller line than you usually do at first to see how strong it is etc., play safe!
