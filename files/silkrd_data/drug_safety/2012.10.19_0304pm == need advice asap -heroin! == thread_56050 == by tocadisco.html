				first time user<br /><br />have used 3 days in a row. about &lt;50mg a day.<br /><br />have around &lt;100mg left .<br /><br />i keep telling myself that i want to finish it, so i never have to deal with it again.<br />and then another part of me keeps saying that i should not do it, to avoid withdrawals..<br /><br />i come here for professional advice. will i experience withdrawals if i stop today? and don&#039;t use for a few more days?<br />or should i use the rest of my H, and get it out of my site? the temptation is real as fuck<br /><br />i also supplement with L-DOPA (95% mucuna pureins) each morning since, but have been taking everyday for my workout supplement (testostorone supplement)<br />I also take a plethora of vitamins to help replenish what i have used up.<br /><br />need an opinion asap! ps. i only use in a span of 6 hours, usually at night time. never during day.<br />

				Dude, trust me... just get it out of your sight and forget about it. Every one of us opiate users wish we could go back and just forget about it. Good luck on the road ahead whatever you choose.

				It&#039;s your first time ever using it?&nbsp; Is the cravings to bad for you to put it up and save some for tomorrow? Have you been or still are a user of other opiates? If not and this is your very first time then the withdrawals shouldn&#039;t be all that noticeable. In the meantime you could do very small bumps when ever you feel any withdrawal effects. Yea save what you got and lower the dosage each day. Are you shooting it? So you beend doing 50mg a day for three days then I&#039;d say try to get by tomorrow on a 20 mg dose. After you do it tuck it away nice and tight, don&#039;t make it easy to get to and right in your line of vision. Try to forget about it and keep yourself occupied. Find something to do that requires you to be focused on it and then really pour yourself into it.<br /><br />What has always helped me the most with withdrawals is marijuana. To me it&#039;s a real God send. Good luck
