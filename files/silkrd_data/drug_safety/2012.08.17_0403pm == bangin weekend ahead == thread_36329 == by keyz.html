				Is this your first time rolling? Also whats the specific dosage on those reds you purchased? I thought they were around 200 mg, which means too much for your first time in my opinion. Also its not advisable to roll for 3 days, you&#039;ll likely experience some&nbsp; form of depression or anxiety afterwards. Please be safe dude as festivals can be great fun, wouldn&#039;t want to ruin it by taking too much and rounding out the weekend in a bad state. Good luck.<br /><br /><br /><br />Be safe,<br /><br />Shifty

				It&#039;s downright stupid to take MDMA on three consecutive days. You could do that with just about any other drug, but not MDMA. The stuff releases massive amounts of serotonin in the brain, and the brain needs time to restock and refuel your depleted serotonin levels. <br /><br />Think of it this way: you&#039;re running your car&#039;s motor in a high speed race on less and less oil and you&#039;re going to ruin the engine.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong. MDMA is wonderful and I love the stuff. It&#039;s just important that you know how it effects your body. Ideally you should give yourself at least a week between each roll.

				Aye mate, the next day when you take the pills you are very likely to not feel anything, it happened to me even after taking 3 days break in-between. You will basically need like double the dosage to feel the same, and you will also feel twice as crap the next day. I would suggest doing mandy the first day, then drink the next day and on the last day try a higher dose of mandy again, but it isn&#039;t a healthy way in my opinion, take care of your body.

				i am taking measures for increasing my serotonin levels between each day from the amount of protein needed, i have vitamin B pills which also help a lot in getting those levels back up as well as Fish Oil, im also planning on sleeping atleast 9 hours a night but never really sure about that...i&#039;ve also been thinking about taking seratonin pills starting a week before so that those levels will remain a constant in my bloodstream<br /><br />i do realize that there is a risk...i wasnt planning on goin balls out hardcore all 3 days but to take enough to have a great time...im on an MDMA break now i havent rolled in about 3 weeks now and wont for til the festival which is still 2 weeks away<br /><br />btw thx everybody for giving me their opinions it really helps

				Please be safe and do your homework! I don&#039;t think B-vitamins and sleep are going to be sufficient. It would probably be alright to roll twice in this span with a day off in between, but personally I would never do that. <br /><br />And please, DO NOT take &quot;serotonin&quot; pills! -- I assume you mean 5-HTP, right? You could run the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is serious. <br /><br />Sorry if I sound preachy. I&#039;m of the persuasion that you should always know your shit when it comes to taking drugs. Stay safe and have fun!&nbsp;

Sure rolling will be fun but try some shrooms or something the next day. Maybe just smoke some ganja the last day as you&#039;re likely to be worn out from two days of rolling/tripping.
