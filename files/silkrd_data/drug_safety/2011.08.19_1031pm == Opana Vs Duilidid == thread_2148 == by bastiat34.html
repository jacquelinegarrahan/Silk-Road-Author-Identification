				I&#039;ve typically used about 6mg (a 4mg and then half of another 4mg) of Hydromorphone the way people would typically take D. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got a 10mg Opana IR - I&#039;ve heard tons of stories about how strong Opana is, a lot of experienced people have run into trouble with them. <br /><br />Since I don&#039;t have a steady supply, I can only use them for really bad breakthroughs of my chronic pain - a few times a week. So - it&#039;s not something that is going to have to happen today, but then again I never know when I&#039;ll get the breakthrough either. <br /><br />In any case - I just want to make sure I&#039;m safe and so wonder about how much I should be looking at taking. <br /><br />Thanks

				I would probably start with 2-3mg if you have a 6mg dillie habit. Its easy to add, but not take away... go check the conversion with iv dilaudid vs iv oxymorphone and see what it says..

If you have a full day with nothing to do or for breakthrough pain management Opana is your friend.<br /><br />Also do you have the IR or ER version of Opana&gt;?<br /><br />:D <br />nomad bloodbath

				It&#039;s an IR. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that getting the ER out of the Timex is a real pain in the ass. <br /><br />With the IR, is it a simple matter to do? Meaning the same as with the D - put it in some hot water, stir and do your thing? Or is there more of a process to it? <br /><br />Thanks again

Your first filter will look like a piece of bubblegum in color and each filter afterwards it will get lighter in color, use different spoons for each filter as well to not reintroduce the binders into the solutions.<br /><br />nomad bloodbath
