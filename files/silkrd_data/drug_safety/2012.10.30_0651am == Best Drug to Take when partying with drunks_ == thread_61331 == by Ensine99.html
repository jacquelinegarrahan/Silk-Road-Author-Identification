				Lately I&#039;ve been trying to figure out a drug/ supplement to take at parties around drunk people since I no longer feel any desire to drink myself after experimenting with psychs.<br />But don&#039;t like rolling or tripping around drunk people. <br />Currently I&#039;m considering Phenethylamine, Phenibut, GHB, or Ketamine. <br />I&#039;m not really interested in strong uppers like amphetamines or coke, or in benzos.<br />Anyone have a suggestion?

				I enjoy it with MDMA, but if you&#039;re against amphes it won&#039;t please you too much. I don&#039;t fully get why you should take Ketamine, Phenethylamine or Phenibut if you&#039;re going to party?<br />If you want to party you should get pushed up, not pushed down.

				I agree with yzxcv12693, taking ketamine or anything like it at a party doesn&#039;t sound like a really pleasant idea. I guess GHB would be possible but watch your dosage.<br />Personally I&#039;d go with MDMA, just take a small dose so you&#039;re not tripping balls but are energetic and happy. I&#039;ve tried many things but all are very different from being drunk so they won&#039;t get you on the same wavelength as the drunks around you. Unless the party&#039;s full of tripping people I&#039;d stay away from most drugs at parties.

				GHB since its somewhat like alcohol but when handled by a responsible individual its way better for you body then alcohol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also done low dosages of 2c-b and 25i-NBOMe (both psychs) around drunk people and at parties. People won&#039;t know you&#039;re tripping since you&#039;re not really tripping anyway. Its very enjoyable getting in the mood without overdoing it or moving towards alcohol. It beats being sober for me, just a little stimulation. Despite that you&#039;ve written of amphetamines and I don&#039;t think you should. But again in low dosages, most people forget how different drugs are at lower dosages.

				you eliminated quite a few of the options. Why don&#039;t you just drink moderately? Drinking is good when partying man, being a drunk is no good but if you feel you could easily control your amounts you should just drink a bit...

				Ket is amazing when partying and luckily there&#039;s a bit of a haze so watching all the ridiculous drunk people won&#039;t piss you off. Every drunk person seriously annoys me when I&#039;m drugs unless it&#039;s k, then I&#039;m too chill to care.

I&#039;ve rolled with other people rolling and that was fun too, I&#039;ve also flipped with people rolling, and flipped with people tripping. I&#039;ve enjoyed all those settings. I&#039;m not really a fan of taking mdma at parties with people drinking since I&#039;m concerned about the empathetic part and coming off weird, also its hard to hold decent conversations when people are plastered but it is more enjoyable then tripping around drunks. I&#039;ve done DOB/DOC, 25i, 25c, mdma, shrooms, and 4-aco-dmt around drunk people before and out of all of those shrooms was the best for me since it gave me the giggles and makes me have a really strong body high, but it still wasn&#039;t great.<br /><br />as for drinking moderately Its not really that feasible I need about 6-8 drinks to get tipsy so if I want to get to that point when everyone else is getting drunk I need to pound shots, and I&#039;m not a huge fan of the hangover the next day (I get really bad body hangovers, ie deadlegs) part of the reason for my asking this is because I don&#039;t like having to drink that much and dealing with the hangover.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=61331.msg556703#msg556703">Quote from: TreeTrunk on October 30, 2012, 06:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">GHB since its somewhat like alcohol but when handled by a responsible individual its way better for you body then alcohol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also done low dosages of 2c-b and 25i-NBOMe (both psychs) around drunk people and at parties.

It&#039;s a stimulant at lower doses, sliding to a hypnotic at large doses. I don&#039;t think there are any other drugs that follow that peculiar dose-effect relationship. <br /><br />Given that you&#039;ll need to choose between a substance that makes you &#039;gitty&#039; like low amounts of alcohol, or &#039;wasted&#039; like high amounts of alcohol - if you want to experience similar effects compared to the people around you. <br /><br />What is the reason you do not want to simply use alcohol like the rest of them though?

				Well whatever drug you take, make sure you&#039;re comfortable with the people around you and the place you take it. Nothing worse than tripping balls and getting nervous, it&#039;ll give you the biggest possible bad trip ever or get you stuck in a mind loop. That&#039;s why taking stuff like LSD at loud and busy parties with rowdy drunks is usually a bad idea. I agree with WhereAmI, Ket doesn&#039;t have to be a problem. Whatever you try, I&#039;d advise a low dose test run so you know what the drug&#039;s like in the setting you&#039;d like to use it in before taking a serious dose.

That said, i regularly drink alcohol are rarely use morphine. <br /><br />For historical reasons alcohol is an acceptable drug in western society. If it would have been discovered a decade ago, it would probably have been banned very quickly and considered a similar treath to GHB or opiates. From a pharmacological standpoint that would be a totally fair assessment. The big practical difference is that alcohol is legal, and for that reason widely available at low cost in most countries.<br /><br />This limits the social problems associated with the addiction largely. A drinking habit to the equivalent of half a litre of liquor a day can be met for $5 a day, while a gram a day heroin habit would cost 10 times as much. The $5/day figure makes it so that many people can afford to buy their dose from their salary or even social benefits, while sustaining a $50/day opiate habit would require criminal means to fund for most people.

				It&#039;s probably already been said, but I&#039;d go for low doses of GHB, mdma, amfetamines (but you dont want to), or benzo but you dont want to.<br />Actually I read somewhere that they are trying to make a beverage that makes you feel a bit like you&#039;ve had some alcohol. But without getting a hangover from it. The funny thing is that they test it with valium...<br />That would go so wrong :p<br />Then again, alcohol is a very destructive drug which can cause all sorts of problems. But yeah, they cant ban it. Wish that were true with all drugs. Things would be a lot better imo.<br /><br />
