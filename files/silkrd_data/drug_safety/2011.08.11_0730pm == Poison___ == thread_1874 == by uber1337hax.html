				I&#039;m new to this whole site and I&#039;m just wondering, how do you know if the drugs you get aren&#039;t poison or how do you know if the sellers aren&#039;t cops or feds? How do you know that the package that&#039;s being sent to you won&#039;t get found out and you might get in trouble???

				in all seriousness, anything that is not bitcoin has a higher risk of being traced back to you. paypal would create an electronic paper trail from your bank or credit card (and valid email address) directly to that persons paypal account, which is linked directly to his or her bank account. now, theres no proof that its for drugs, or whatever you want to buy, but its still linking you to that person... also, as a buyer, bitcoin is the only method that allows you the courtesy of escrow (which, if you havent figured it out, allows silk road to hold your funds as a sort of deposit until you receive your package, at which point you can release them to the seller or get them back if it never shows). paypal always leaves you open to never receiving your package AND it makes it so that you cant leave seller feedback for the other buyers. its really ideal for scammers b/c they dont care if theyre paper trailed to a person that WANTS drugs, they probly dont have any drugs themselves in the first place, and the only way u can bitch about them is on the forums, at which point its too late cuz they already hav your money and hav moved on to some other pathetic penny-grasping scheme. in other words, paypal doesnt guarantee that things will turn out badly for you, via cops, scammers, or otherwise... but it makes it a HELL of a lot more likely... hope i helped!&nbsp; ~love, smod
