				I have mixed up some pure alprazolam(xanax) powder with PG, 2mg per 1ml. I am very aware of the potency of the drug and the dangers it poses.<br /><br />I keep the big bottle locked in my safe deposit box but I want to store some around the house but I am worried someone will drink the liquid one day not knowing what it is.<br /><br />I have 5ml, 10ml, and 20ml bottles which will hold 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg of xanax respectively.<br /><br />I know that when not mixed with other depressants that benzos will generally not kill you in large amount but just knock you out for a few days and cause memory issues.<br /><br />For legal reasons it is disguised as another over the counter drug. I know from experience that you cannot rely on people respecting your medicine cabinet and that people sometime pilfer things without asking. While I resent people sneaking stuff from my cabinet I would rather they not have serious problems because of it.<br /><br />I want to keep as much as I can around the house without the worries of someone overdosing on it. How much can a person with no tolerance take and still be okay end after waking up?<br />

				There&#039;s no way to know what is going to be a dangerous/lethal dose for any specific person without knowing that person&#039;s body chemistry. There&#039;s also no way to guarantee that whomever is taking the drugs is not going to be under the influence of&nbsp; another substance when they accidentally swallow your xanax. If one is drunk and swallows 8mg of xanax, they&#039;re probably in for a bad time. If you&#039;re concerned about other people&#039;s safety, then you shouldn&#039;t be disguising xanax preparations as something else.<br /><br />It might be a better idea to instead disguise it as some sort of &#039;essential oil&#039;. They come in small, amber bottles (with eyedroppers), and someone is a lot less likely to ingest a few ml of patchouli oil. Inconspicuous, and less dangerous.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s pretty standard practice to dye GHB blue when it&#039;s stored in the fridge, to discourage accidental ingestion.

				Its a good question, but one with a difficult answer.<br /><br />If you look at animal tests, the LD50 (dose that kills half of the test animals) is in the order of 1 gram per kilogram of body weight. Extrapolated that means a 80 kilogram man would have a 50% chance of ingesting 80 grams of xanax - yes, that equates to 4000 bars.<br /><br />These studies only look at the rate of survival though, not at how badly you are affected if you do survive. Also, they don&#039;t usually take into account factors such as being unable to get up for a week for a glass of water, resulting in death from dehydration rather than the substance itself. Combined with alcohol (which i can imagine given the scenario) can me deadly at much lower doses as a consequence of respiratory depression. In that case taking someone to hospital and using a ventilator will vastly improve chances of survival. <br /><br />It&#039;s down to you calling the shots really. If someone accidentally took 10 mg of your xanax, i would suggest bringing that person to the ER for observation, especially if any alcohol was involved. If a lot of alchol was involved, i suppose it would be wise to do so after ingesting anything over 2 mg or so. <br /><br />As the onset of effect is pretty fast, you would probably notice if anyone took a significant dose, resulting in symptoms like drowsiness, or lack of response in general at larger doses. This in itself is usually not life threatening as long as you seek medical attention. If you do not, there is a realistic chance someone could suffocate in their sleep shortly after.<br /><br />Also, try not to keep benzo&#039;s in mis-labeled medicine bottles - you an use unmarked bottles if you want to hide them. Wrong labels can lead to incredible risks. Lets simply say that you would put 2 mg xanx tablets in a bottle marked as 25 mg benadryl. If i were to be bitten by wasp or bee (which i am allergic to) i would down 5 or 10 of those tablets to arrest anyphylactic shock caused by the sudden histamine release. Taking xanax instead of benadryl would in that case have the opposite effect, and be pretty dangerous to do. <br /><br />Obviously i would usually not be impolitely nicking someones medication, but if time is of the essence, and something labeled &#039;this will safe your life&#039; is within reach, i would not hesitate to take it without asking. <br /><br />

				I would go with the previous comment to put it in a bottle of something that people would not be tempted to ingest or borrow.
