				Dunno. They will probably help with heart racing, but I still wouldn&#039;t be very communicative.<br />MDMA seems just perfect. I really don&#039;t want to use it very often. Only in some specific situations. Less than once per moth probably.<br />I really just need something for the pupils. I&#039;m able to control the big grin. ;D

				Hey,<br /><br />social anxiety is a totally normal response when you meet new people or when you have to speak in front of a large audience. This is due to the fact that our brain still works in the same way as 100k years before when our ancestors strode through the savannaeh of Africa. Back then, meeting unknown people was a real danger. There were rivaling tribes, so chances were high that you would take a club to the head. The brain responded to that with a fight or flight choice, and still does. To be able to run as hell you get a pretty nice shot of adrenaline, free drugs so to speak :) Take it as a gift from your body, and after 2 to 5 minutes, you should be back to baseline and more relaxed.<br /><br />If you use MDMA, why not try a low dose at home, say 30 to 50mg, and check a mirror every thirty minutes.<br /><br />

				I know that social anxiety is normal to some extend, but defiantly not to extend I have it. I used to avoid the situations you describe as good as I could completely. I feel way more uncomfortable in specific situations than most people do. I&#039;m constantly thinking about what others think of me. I know it&#039;s irrational but still can&#039;t do anything about it.<br />However MDMA seems just perfect. But I know that I can&#039;t use it too often. That&#039;s why I decided to use it for the most awkward situations.<br /><br />I will try what low doses do to me and my pupils. Thx.

				50mg shouldn&#039;t blow your pupils up that badly.&nbsp; Try it first, see how it feels, it should be enough to take down your anxiety though.

				Based on your post you might be a DEA agent since you dont know shit about drugs. Only an experienced user could even attempt to hide MDMA use. Physical affects aside, its easy to identify someone thats rolling because they are fucked up. You will act different, not normal and thats what people will notice. If your around people that know your antisocial and all the sudden your a social butterfly the odds are someone will say to someone else &quot;thats what drugs can do for you!&quot;<br /><br />-1 for the worst name ever.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=51774.msg514492#msg514492">Quote from: DEA-agent on October 10, 2012, 04:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hey guys,<br />I suffer from slight social anxiety disorder.<br />I want to use MDMA in specific social situations, since it really helps me.<br />Obviously I cant&#039;t use that on an every day basis, but I could use it in situations where I&#039;m really unconfortable.

				DEA agent - you should make a new name because the DEA are the worst kind of scum there is. Turning 27.5grams into 28 grams so they can get trafficking charges. Counting pills mixed with fillers as all active ingredients. The DEA has hurt more people than any drug dealer I know. Your a loser.

				Did you expect a community of drug users to show you love after you named your nic DEA agent? Millions of Americans have been personally hurt by the DEA. I have never met anyone that was shot or stabbed by a gang member. In fact most of the pain I have felt in my own life and observed in others was directly because of the DEA. We dont believe in drug laws but we arnt hurting anyone. We dont push crack, coke, heroin, or meth. We dont sell to children. We dont rob, beg, or borrow. But the DEA is happy to raid us regardless.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=51774.msg514601#msg514601">Quote from: DEA-agent on October 10, 2012, 05:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Seriously boys?<br />I&#039;m sure nobody really thinks that I&#039;m from the DEA.<br />But wtf makes you believe that I like the DEA?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Members of The ILF have been on micro-doses of MDA/MDMA in plenty of &quot;social&quot; situations that require one to &quot;keep it together&quot;: work, get-togethers with neighbors/family, etc.&nbsp; There&#039;s a huge difference between eyes-in-the-back-of-the-head rollling balls and 0.2-0.3 mg/kg you-on-a-great-day incognito rolling.&nbsp; We&#039;ve found these latter experiences to be very rewarding in their own right and even attribute better work performance and social bonding to their assistance.&nbsp; Pupils might be a little bigger, but they won&#039;t be saucers, and they&#039;ll still look along the continuum of &quot;normal.&quot;<br /><br />In addition, maybe you could go by Anti-DEA Agent?&nbsp; Or maybe ATM Machine?&nbsp; And while we certainly understand the vitriol directed against the Agency, we would like to remind people of a great -- as pro-ecstasy and harm reduction as could be -- little web site out there that made a similar joke: [WARNING CLEAR NET AHH] www.thedea.org

				How old are you? The SA will fade with age, partially as you stop giving a shit and learn to chill, or tune out.<br />Some meds can help. Benzos work well but every dose is a step backwards due to the addiction and tolerance, nevermind the fact that they dope you out. If you have to use any benzos, stick with long half-life slow onset/offset diazepam. Stay away from lorazepam etc.<br />Buspirone or an SSRI can help. Venlafaxine is good but not so often prescribed. I believe citalopram is the current favourite.<br />Since you are happy to buy drugs on the grey/black market, you could try tianeptine, although it&#039;s a little bit activating which may be the opposite of the desired effect.

You missed the bit about tuning out too though :) Do you think you might have aspie symptoms?

This third time around I am struggling but I think I&#039;m making progress now finally.

A lot of the prescription drugs mentioned here have serious side-effects and can interact badly with other medication you maybe on. Also some of them could interfere with drugs you use recreationally. I don&#039;t think you were asking for advice on how to manage your anxiety but I hope you don&#039;t take advice about medication with out meeting a doctor. <br />If you&#039;re just looking for something to constrict your pupils REASEARCH pilocarpine 0.5% or physostigmine 1% eye drops. Medscape has a great drug interaction checker you can use to be safe. It also has dosing guide and side effect profiles for the mentioned medicines. Anyway topical medications are far more safe than systemic drugs. Both the eye drops I&#039;ve mentioned have been used safely for glaucoma for decades. But make sure you do your research anyway. Be safe. I&#039;m just trying to answer your question about countering the pupil dilatation without going into your SAD. Yes that is the accepted acronym!<br />You&#039;re 23 and you&#039;re smart enough to be on SR so you&#039;re smart enough to use the internet for thorough research. Make your own decisions about MDMA dosage and frequency after thorough research. Don&#039;t limit it just to erowid. Look for scientific papers on pubmed about acute and chronic toxicity of MDMA use. There are plenty of articles out there.<br />On a less serious note if you really want to hide the fact that you occasionally like to roll then just act like you&#039;re always rolling even when you&#039;re sober! Lol. Everyone will think you&#039;re just super enthusiastic about life and a really great human being.

				30-50mg of MDMA, will give you a nice mood lift with out any noticeable effects.<br /><br />Just try it in a solo setting and see what you think., I sometime drop 30mg for business&nbsp; social events. I hate small talk, and I would never be friends with these people, low dose MDMA will get you over the hump. You don&#039;t have to go balls out to get the positive effects of some drugs.<br /><br />Fuck those upset about your user name, offence is a self generated emotion.

				Ya, I tried 50mg alone at home and it seems like a good dosage. Mood was slightly lifted, but not to extremely, and my pupils looked quite normal. That should work out for me. No need for eyed drops, but thx for the tip.<br />I&#039;m now doing some research about the neurotoxiy in order to figure out how frequently I can use it safely.<br />Thanks for all your answers.
