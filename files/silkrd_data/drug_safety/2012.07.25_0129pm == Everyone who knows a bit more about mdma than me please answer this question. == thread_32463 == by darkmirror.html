				&nbsp; Me and my partner did around 140 to 150 mg&#039;s a piece last night of Juergen&#039;s old batch of mdma crystal&#039;s (the one that had mixed reviews from everyone). <br />She got upset to her stomach and stayed in bed all night, now my stomach was irritated but not to bad. We both also reported twitching and shaking about 45 min. to 2 hours after taking. Now from your experiences was this due to the mdma having some type of speed in it? <br />Or can this be normal?&nbsp; It should be noted that I like Jeurgen and I don&#039;t think he would taint his own crystals... <br />This info might help. We ate about 5 to 6 hours before dosing, small meals. I put the crystals in a emptied cap. This was her 3rd time doing mdma, and this was my 3rd time since I used to do it in the late 90&#039;s early 2000&#039;s. <br />Anyone&#039;s wisdom will be much appreciated. <br />Thank you, darkmirror

				Can I also point out that 150mg is a MASSIVE dose for someone who hasn&#039;t used mdma in 10 years (and back then im sure it was pretty weak stuff in comparison)<br /><br />Furthermore woman are more sensitive to mdma, I always give them less.<br /><br /><br />Next time try 100mg yourself and 70mg for her. You can always add more if you aren&#039;t rolling hard enough in 2 hours time...<br /><br />I have a female friend that throws up during the come up every time, until we discovered Ginger pills. Take one in the morning and another an hour before the roll and your stomach issues should be reduced by 90%.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I agree with lowering the dosage. Also, that whole imma roll harder on an empty stomach should be for more hardcore users. Mdma is all about factors to me especially if you been on the bench for a while. Lower the dose, eat normal couple of hours before, and always test your product. I get my reagents ready for each batch I get. I get amazed at the garbage my friend brings around for me to test. The stuff my friend gets is obviously from IRL not SR.

				I am a pretty regular MDMA user and I went through a stage where I would vomit every time I peaked. It lasted a few months, and it seems I just got over it. Funniest moment was when I walked out of a club quickly and was approached by a homeless guy asking for money. I projectile vomited while he was mid sentence. He laughed and walked away. I also laughed, then walked back inside the club for a fun nite!<br /><br />Jeurgen&#039;s stuff had some pretty mixed reviews, so it may have had something to do with the gear or it may have had something to do with the dose. Like was said earlier, lower the dose and see how that goes.
