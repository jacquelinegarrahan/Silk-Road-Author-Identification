				I&#039;m seriously considering spending the Summer enjoying a blend of methylone, 4-mec, and pentedrone, taken rectally.<br /><br />Is there any reason why this would be unsafe?<br /><br />Is there any advice or protips anyone would offer?<br /><br />In the interests of harm reduction, I thought I&#039;d doublecheck this.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />I plan on posting an Erowid-style experience report for the first few times, for those interested in this blend and/or route of administration.

				Aurelias, great info man.<br /><br />i also take 2x 500mg Vitamin C pills before roll.<br />And 2x more during the roll, before 2nd redose.<br />it gives energy, and makes you higher.<br /><br />And about mixing things,<br /><br />I heard M1 and PVP, is a great mix. <br />Pente is close to PVP<br />But I would just do M1, then do Small Bumps of Pentedrone, to keep you goin, like other have said<br />4 MEC---no clue.<br /><br />Ive done .6 grams of M1 in 6 hours. no harm done.

It is a pure dopaminergic and norepinephrinergic stimulant.

				One thing i find a shame is that all these -Drone drugs are getting a bad name for one reason amongst others.<br /><br />Theyre expecting a Mephedrone replacement. and Mephedrone was designed as a MDMA alternative/replacement.<br /><br />If someone tries one of these other analogues and doesn&#039;t get the blasting euphoria, then its &quot;Shit, not worth the money&quot;<br />I think when people write reviews on forums they should provide two things, <br />1) The drugs they&#039;ve tried previously and if they liked em/what they liked about em. you could have this in your signature as most people do. it provides a great deal of insight. for instance, alot of people might say Salvia or LSA is like LSD because they think thats what LSD must be like. Or they state mephedrone feels exactly like ecstasy when they mean that&#039;s what they&#039;d imagine it to be like.<br /><br />2) They should state what they were looking for in a drug.<br />This is why i&#039;ve seen 100s of posts saying that MPA, Ethylphenidate, MDAI, MDPV, Methylone, Pentylone, Pentedrone, 3-MMC, Benzedrone Brephedrone etc. are shit. and far less posts stating the actual effects of the drug, and how easy it was on the body etc.<br /><br />What I&#039;m interested in is MDMA&#039;s Oxytocin release and adding an Oxytocin nasal spray or sublingual tabs to an RC session to bring about the love feeling.<br />Also, MDAI has been reported to be massively enhanced in the sub 100mg range by predosing on Deprenyl or Hordenine, and possibly Harmaline but i&#039;m not sure.<br />there are many posts about the first combo on bluelight.<br /><br />Combinations of RC&#039;s are the way forward, but due to synergy one must be extremely careful. one RC may stimulate you via a different mechanism to another, and combined these could either be magical or fatal.<br /><br />Does anyone know of simmilar combo&#039;s? I&#039;m interested in Noopept as an enhancer for various drugs. If anyone has heard much about that it&#039;s worth looking into along with other nootropics<br /><br />PS: Is there a thread where we can discuss soups or other post-sess topup foods?
