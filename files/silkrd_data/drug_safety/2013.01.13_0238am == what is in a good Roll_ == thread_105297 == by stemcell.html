				i know some press pure molly tabs. Others have a mixture of chems. Does anyone know what is in a so called &quot;good roll&quot;? Is it best to just press pure MDMA or is there a ratio of differnt things that should be included for a night of fun?<br /><br />i have heard of Meth, MDA, MDMA, Ketamine all being included but I dont know if there is a special reciept or do people just preffer pure mdma rolls with nothing else in them?

				It depends on the person and the experience they are looking for.. a lot of street pill presses have additives because the added chemicals have similar qualitative effects and are cheaper.. They do alter the experience though. Sometimes people take these because they are all that is to be had. On the other hand a lot of people enjoy the empathic qualities of MDMA but are looking for a more specific type of high. Adding meth is fairly common to produce a more stimulant type high, which some find good in high energy settings.&nbsp; Addition of MDA will cause a more hallucinogenic roll (ie open and closed eye visuals, etc). Also people will often combine MDMA with other distinct dosages of drugs like LSD for candy-flipping or , as you mentioned, ketamine for kitty-flipping, or mushrooms for hippy flipping.. etc. It all depends on the desired experience

				If you&#039;re looking for personal opinions I&#039;d vote MDMA only. A lot of people seem to like extra stimulants, but I&#039;m overly sensitive to them. MDMA is the only stim that doesn&#039;t have me shaking and sweating. The energy is there, but I don&#039;t need to do anything with it if I don&#039;t want to.<br /><br />If you&#039;re planning on selling pills with something else in them at least do your customers a favor and be upfront about it. Repeat business is normally the goal :)

If you do decide to make your own combo, tell your customers exactly what combo you&#039;re putting in the presses so they know what to expect. It sucks to take a pill and expect it to be a pure smooth roll and then having some weird feelings that you know aren&#039;t coming from the MDMA. That being said, I can say that I&#039;ve had rolls that were mostly (read 85-90%) MDMA and the rest was meth and I know that I had a great time with the added euphoria with the meth. Was enough to keep me energized but didn&#039;t leave me feeling cracked out. I believe I&#039;ve also had some presses that had MDMA/MDA in them, and that&#039;s also fun. There may have been one that had some 2C-X in it, not sure which one though. The MDMA/Ketamine combo would be interesting, but again, it&#039;s best to tell the customers what exactly you&#039;re putting in your press.

				Personally I think I favor MDA over MDMA. The highs are VERY similar but I enjoy the visual and physical pushiness of MDA over the more empathetic effects of MDMA alone. Lots of people enjoy the combo though.

				thank you for the feedback and yes I would never cut something purposely in order to cut costs, only to make something better if people wanted it. What can one expect from 2C-X?<br /><br />Hmm maybe ill have to play with some differnet combos here to see what comes out best. Obviously there is a better for each situation. My personal choice is just pure mdma but i know those with a little meth can make for an awesome time at a club.

				I remember back in the day (90s)&nbsp; 99% of all pills were just pure MDMA , We didn&#039;t have to worry about testing or pillreports, You could always count on the pills being MDMA. I took 100&#039;s of rolls over a 10 year period and only got shitty Rolls a couple times. Now a days I would never buy a street level Roll unless I knew for sure it was Dutch sourced or pure MDMA.

				IMO 3 parts MDMA to 1 part Speed. <br /><br />Sometimes you get that mongy feeling off M.D. I always think it&#039;d better with a bit of speed for a more energetic rush
