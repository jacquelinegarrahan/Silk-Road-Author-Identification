				I´m planning to take a dose of sildenafil when taking amphetamine, since I usually can&#039;t get it up at all when I&#039;ve taken Amphetamine. <br />Me and my girlfriend like the sex when we are on...if I sometimes can get my little man up which happens rarely and not for too long&nbsp; :(<br />I have a lot of experience in drugs and cocktails and never had any physical problems with my heart function, circulatory system or collapsing, so that should not be a problem usually.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t find any real helpful information if there are actual physical dangers or correlations when mixing both, neither reliable experience reports...<br /><br />So I&#039;m asking you guys here, has anyone done it? <br />If yes, which dosage roughly of both substances? <br />Any strange side effects like heart racing or similar?<br /><br />Thanks for any answer and sorry for my odd english&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				From what I know most amphetamine derivatives have a similar effect on the erectile front. My experience with MDMA is that about 75mg of Viagra helps get things moving again and I&#039;ve done it numerous times with no known negative effects. I&#039;d probably start with a smaller dose on Viagra the first time just to make sure it doesn&#039;t react badly with you but otherwise I&#039;d say you are pretty safe.<br /><br />The problem you are likely to run into though is that while it&#039;s possible to force the erection, it is often difficult to actually have an orgasm. This makes for a fun little bit of fucking but almost always end with a sweaty girlfriend / wife begging you to stop fucking her for a while. One rather odd suggestion if you are doing it with your partner would be to hit the stuff midway though and you&#039;d likely finish right as you were coming up.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck!

				Well, the main problem for me is to actually get an erection at all and then keep it going for more than a few minutes, that&#039;s where we (my gf and me) have to start with...then experience will show the rest. I thought about taking 0.5 - 8.0 gram of amphetamine/speed which is my usual dosage distributed over an evening and then 50 mg sildefanil when we want to have sex. <br /><br />Thanks for your report DiamondSky.<br /><br />I hope there are some more people to share their knowledge on that topic, I really don&#039;t want to risk any real dangerous physical reactions or side effects!&nbsp; :-\

				Yeah I hear you, I think a lot of people end up bragging about being able to fuck all night on speed, meth, mdma but for me it&#039;s a shrivel fest made more frustrating by the fact that I really want to be fucking when I am high. Anyway, best of luck, sure a few other people will chime in but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have an issue. If you haven&#039;t taken it before without meth I strongly suggest you do so just so you don&#039;t get caught in one of those &quot;is this normal&quot; states of mind. For me sober or not I flush a little, sometimes get a little stuffy nose and well, obviously get wood when looking at a pretty girl :-&gt;

It can act as a Vasodialator, relieving symptoms related to Vasoconstriction (good thing).

				I take meth rather than just amph an I find that with good quality meth that has a high proportion of D-Meth, I have no problem getting it up and in fact sometimes have a &quot;harder&quot; and longer standing salute than sober (to be clear, I have no issues with getting it up sober)..<br />When I do mix in sildanefil with ice, if I&#039;ve been on a longer binge, about 6 hours after taking V I tend to exhibit signs of high blood pressure - bright red ears, bit of a headache, noticeable feeling of the heartbeat in my head, muscles more vascular, etc.<br /><br />Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but in theory mixing a cardio-exciter drug like amph/meth with a drug that lowers blood pressure may create a situation where your heart tries to work even harder as your body&#039;s telling it the blood isn&#039;t reaching extreme parts (fingers/toes in this instance).. this is purely my speculation, and the opposite may also be true - V&#039;s the effect of reducing your blood pressure alleviates some of the stress introduced by your heart getting too excited from the amph..<br /><br />anyways, do plenty of research and play safe kids :)
