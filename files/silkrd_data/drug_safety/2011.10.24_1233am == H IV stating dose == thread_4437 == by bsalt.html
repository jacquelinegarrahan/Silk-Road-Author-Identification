				It really depends on the quality of the dope. I wouldn&#039;t do more than a bag to start with maybe even just a half if you know it&#039;s good stuff. You can always do more later for stronger effects, but if you OD and no one is there to help you you&#039;re screwed. <br /><br />Be extra careful with dope you haven&#039;t had before. It might be stronger than you think. My friend almost died from just two bags of some potent H yet he could shoot two of most other stamps with no problem.<br /><br />Shooting anything is dangerous if you don&#039;t have sterile equipment and properly filter the shot. Make sure you understand what you&#039;re doing. It&#039;s helpful to have someone with experience with you in case of any problems.<br /><br />Smoking or shooting coke, meth, or heroin are much more addictive than snorting. The high is so good that you&#039;ll want to keep chasing it, yet you can never quite recapture how it felt the first few times.

If you can snort a bag with no effect at all, that means it takes you 3-4 bags to get fucked up. If this is the case you have a decent tolerance. And i would recommend 1-2 bags. I know a lot of people on here want to be safe instead of sorry, but half a bag? Unless its different dope than what you&#039;re used to, half a bag would do nothing for you, even if you shoot it.<br /><br />Sorry if anyone thinks this is bad advice, but if you&#039;re doing heroin you already know the risks. Please don&#039;t take my words as fact, you need to know your own body, and i know that when i was snorting dope, i got to the point where it took me 3-4 bags to get fucked up, and started shooting (as said above, worst mistake of my life) and with a 3-4 snorting tolerance, 2 bags IV&#039;d seemed to give the same effect (Although it doesn&#039;t last as long when you shoot it, as opposed to snorting.)<br /><br />Please think before you act, and do your research, and again YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR BODY. Dope effects EVERYONE differently.

				before you try the iv route try using rectally. <br />I gave up the pick many years due to social stigmata, and ive found up the bum is 85% as good. no breath but no track marks either.

				First, don&#039;t go thinking snorting 1 bag is the same as doing 1 bag IV.<br /><br />The bioavailibility of H is 40-60% when you snort it, it is 100% when you do it via IV.&nbsp; Then you have to take in to account the possibility of different strengths between one batch and the next.<br /><br />For the first time I wouldn&#039;t do more than 50-100mg via IV (basically 1 bag).&nbsp; I would suggest splitting one bag between two 1cc needles.&nbsp; Do the first one and wait at least 10 minutes.&nbsp; If everything seems good, do the second one.<br /><br />You should be able to judge from that what your tolerance will be.&nbsp; I figure if you can snort 1 bag without getting high you can probably do 1-2 bags via IV.&nbsp; But never go as high as you think you can the first time with any batch.&nbsp; Make it a rule of thumb to try 25-50% of your usually dose when you start a new batch, or you go from snorting to IV&#039;ing&nbsp; the first time.<br /><br />When trying a new batch I&#039;ll push the plunger down halfway the first time and wait about a minute, just in case, and I always start off at least 50% of what I would normally do until I know what I have isn&#039;t 4 times as strong as the last batch I tried.<br /><br />Better safe than unconscious on the floor.&nbsp; Tends to put a crimp in your day.<br /><br />

				Thanks Jojo I hit it today. I broke the stamp into 2 pins and did like you said did one. Waited about 15 minutes then hit the other one, but to be honest not what I expected.&nbsp; Definitely hit me but more of a disorientation then my warm blanket feeling that I love. Maybe just because the first time and the queasiness sucked. Any who thanks for the tips!!
