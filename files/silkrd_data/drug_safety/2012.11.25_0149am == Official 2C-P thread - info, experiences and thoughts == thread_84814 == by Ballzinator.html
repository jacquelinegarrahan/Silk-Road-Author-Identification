				Title: <strong>Official 2C-P thread - info, experiences and thoughts</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;m starting this thread because I think that 2C-P is among the most underrated psychedelics ever. Let&#039;s start with the basics:<br />2C-P is the longest-lasting and most potent of the better-known 2Cs (D, E, P, B, C, I) with a duration of 10-20 hours and typical doses of 2-16mg. It shares most of its effect profile with it&#039;s alkylated cousins D and E with a few very interesting exceptions. It can cause auditory hallucinations as well as out-of-body experiences and ego-softening or even ego-loss. It is also a substantially better creativity-enhancer at low to moderate doses.<br />2C-P is the most visual in the realm of the alkylated 2Cs but it is still considerably less visual than some of the better-known halogenated (B, C, I) or thionated (T-2, T-7) ones.<br />I encourage everyone to ask questions and post additional info, most importantly experience reports. The second post in this thread will be one of my own reports.<br /><br />What the SR community thinks about 2C-P so far:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6545.msg57022#msg57022">Quote from: towelie on December 06, 2011, 07:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I will assume by the emoticon you are aware of how mindfuckingly strong 2c-p is and how steep the dose/response curve is. Since 10mg is a light dose of I, I would probably go with the P and triple check my measurements before dosing.<br />Just check the wiki on the P and then choose<br /><br />Happy trips :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6545.msg57695#msg57695">Quote from: Crisis on December 07, 2011, 05:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From my experience, 2cp lasts a lot longer than e or I.

				Date of experience: 10/05/2012<br />Age: 20<br />Sex: male<br />Weight: 81kg<br />Prescription medicine: none<br />Chronic illnesses: Attention Deficit Disorder<br />Other notes: none<br />Substance(s) and dosages (if known), method and time frame of administration if multiple:<br />2C-P, ~3-4mg, intranasal, T+0h<br /><br />Report:<br />Because my scale isn&#039;t very accurate at low quantities, I weighed out a larger amount. I weighed it multiple times and I got consistent readings of 10-11mg. Then I divided it in three equal piles and snorted one of them. I have read about 2C-P giving people unbearable nasal burning sensations but I found it to be only slightly more painful than snorting a large dose of Methylone or 4-MEC.<br /><br />T+0:10h<br />Damn, this is coming on fast! If taken orally, it takes one full hour to feel the first effects of 2C-P but after only 10 minutes of snorting it I&#039;m already half-way where I want to get. I feel slightly nauseous.<br /><br />T+0:20h<br />Unfortunately I have to throw up. Fortunately I haven&#039;t eaten anything today. The effects are already stronger than I thought they would get. That&#039;s not a bad thing though. No anxiety whatsoever.<br /><br />T+0:30h<br />I throw up a second and last time. The effects are still intensifying. I&#039;m watching stupid shit on the internet until I peak.<br /><br />T+0:45h<br />The effects are not getting any more intense. Everything I see is moving/morphing/shifting in fantastic ways. I see patterns on plain-colored surfaces. For example, I&#039;m reading YouTube comments and the white background behind the text turns into a wall with graffiti of awesome detail.<br /><br />T+0:55h<br />I decide to take my phone and my good headphones (Creative SoundBlaster Tactic3D Sigma), put on some psychedelic music and let my thoughts drift while laying on my bed in a dark room. I choose the Album &quot;Blue Moon Station&quot; by Solar Fields (amazing music and artist!!!).<br />Despite the stimulating effects of 2C-P I can enter a hypnagogic/sleep paralysis kinda state rather easily (I&#039;m a proud lucid dreamer :D). The music and my thoughts create extremely plastic and vivid imagery and scenery. I won&#039;t even try to explain that. People who have had full-blown psychedelic experiences will know what I&#039;m talking about though.<br /><br />T+2:15h<br />The music is coming to an end and I&#039;m coming back from a fantastic journey through my mind. I&#039;m still trippin&#039; ballz but not as intensely as before. I continue to enjoy the stimulating and sensory-enhancing effects of 2C-P. The weather is beautiful (25°C where I live) so I decide to go in the garden and let my thoughts drift some more.<br /><br />T+5:20h<br />I decide to write this report. I&#039;m still feeling the effects of 2C-P quite clearly but nowhere near as intensely as before.<br /><br /><br />This is my first experience report. Please give feedback on what I did right and wrong :)

				I&#039;ve had 2C-P and it was overwhelming. I was not expecting to be tripping for that long. After awhile it was exhausting and I couldn&#039;t sleep. It was pretty intense. I could imagine with a better setting it being more pleasurable but with my experience, yikes. Tripping balls is the only way to describe it. I became one with the pudding, and the animals, and the sands. (there isn&#039;t any sand around here)

The day before I trip I go to bed two hours early to wake up two hours early the next morning and immediately drop the 2C-P after a light breakfast. That way, the trip has minimal impact on my sleeping cycle.

				Ok, I have took 60mgs of 2c-p last night and I&#039;m still feeling it.First of all I know this dose doesn&#039;t seems normal and I can&#039;t say it&#039;s normal but I was in total control of myself almost every moment of the trip.But of course I can&#039;t recommend this dose to anyone.Maybe I can&#039;t smoke the weed as you can smoke but simply I&#039;m good on 60mgs of 2c-p.Usually I don&#039;t take it this much my ordinary dose is about 25-30 mg but when I want to feel the electricity in my whole body and synapses between the neurons I just need to take it that much.Actually I can feel this electricity and vibrations on 30-40 mg 2c-e but 2c-p is very different and has clearer head&nbsp; than 2c-e for me.When I take 30 mg 2c-e,I don&#039;t need to listen to music for feeling the vibrations and electricity,I just lie down to bed to feel them and to live an OBE.But on 2c-p I just need to listen to music for that.On 2c-e I just can listen to my own voices and an electronic music like thing that I don&#039;t know where it comes from...possibly comes directly from the&nbsp; existence.On the other hand I feel much better be physical with 2c-p than 2c-e.Actually I never feel any nausea with both of them but I see many people(maybe everybody) feel nauseous and vomit most of them when it&#039;s picking.I also tried to snort 2c-e and 2c-p and I snorted 15-20 mg from both of them but it hurts much and I couldn&#039;t find this way is intense enough.I can see very specific patterns everywhere even on my skin or on my tongue and I think this is the pattern of existence.But I don&#039;t interest OEVs much because the CEVs are just fantastic with 2c-p.They are also good with 2c-e but I&#039;m seeing many snakes,reptiles or dragons with 2c-e and 2c-e CEVs are more static than 2c-p.I&#039;m lucid dreaming and living OBEs since I was a child and these substances can easy trigger this OBEs.I just need to close my eyes for several seconds to several minutes for this.After all these substances have a very special place for myself,yes 2c-e sometimes can be dark or very confusing but 2c-p can also be very dark too.But there&#039;s nothing to worry about this I think,I can easily going out this kind of state of mind if I want.Be physical I&#039;m feeling cold on high doses with both of them and I&#039;m squeezing my jaw more with 2c-e,I&#039;m feeling some tremors and lulling in extremities also more with 2c-e and I&#039;m feeling a burning on my back,jugular muscles and spinal cord on high doses more with 2c-p.I also feel some kind of intestinal weirdness and ass pain like something with both of them but it&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br /><br />I bought 2c-e from Nevita and 2c-p from TheScienceGuy on SR and both of them was very clean and fine.I just wanted to buy from Satire,His prices was so great I guess around 65$ for one gram 2c-p but he doesn&#039;t sell it now.I just want to see more 2c-p and 2c-e on SR but I know these substances never will be like 2c-b or 2c-i because simply they are not for everyone,if you think to take some drugs and dance at the party there are much more efficient drugs for this like mdma or 2c-i but if anyone looks for a really unique and interesting psychedelic for especially CEVs and OBEs,should give a chance to 2c-p and 2c-e definitely.

If shit goes sideways in your head you can always just lay down, listen to some music and clear your mind. The duration is something not to underestimate. Simply wake up 1-2 hours early, eat a light breakfast and drop the 2C-P. That way the trip won&#039;t disturb your sleep cycle as much, if at all.<br />Stay safe and happy tripping ;)

				The one time I took 2C-P, I was underwhelmed. It was like 2C-E &quot;lite,&quot; with the somber mindset I find in 2C-E and with a moderately high body load, although the characteristic auditory hallucinations were certainly there (not something I see in other 2C&#039;s). Honestly, unlike DOB, another long-acting psychedelic, it was not fun. It was just all right.<br /><br />The funny thing about the multitude of psychedelics out there is the fact that although almost everyone gets the same kind of effects from them and can expect similar things, every individual finds more value in different ones. I am glad that 2C-P is enjoyable for many. It just isn&#039;t for me - too tame and not insightful, plus exhausting.

				I&#039;ve had one experience, I&#039;ll be glad to share it:<br /><br />Male, 31 years old, 150 pounds<br />Set: tripping with 6 good friends, all experienced, excellent mood<br />Setting: Isolated large cabin in the woods, very secluded, have tripped there before. Pretty much the perfect tripping setting<br />Substance: ~10-12mg dose of 2C-P (I think I got it from KwikTrip), a few glasses of wine, and a moderate amount of good pot<br />Duration: about 14-16 hours, kinda hard to tell.<br /><br />Felt no effects for about 4 hours. I didn&#039;t take notes or anything, and it was over a month ago, but I can tell you a few things. First off, unlike LSD or the tryptamines. my appetite was intact the entire time; I think I ate twice during the trip, plus some snacks and a moderate amount of alcohol (a few glasses of wine).<br /><br />I did not get the chance to spend much time by myself, and there was plenty of activity, so I didn&#039;t notice too much in the way of auditory hallucination. I saw the craziest hallucination I think I&#039;ve ever seen with my eyes open: I was putting on a Poolside (awesome band) mixtape (free on soundcloud), and no shit, the album art just starting having a party. I nearly dropped my phone, the people were just moving all over, dancing, serving drinks, right there on my phone screen! My roommate saw me staring at my phone with this look on my face, he came over and tried to tell me that it was just the album picture, but he wasn&#039;t fooling me, there was definitely a party happening on my phone screen.<br /><br />I felt great the entire night. I think this might have been one of the &quot;funniest&quot; drugs I&#039;ve ever taken; I laughed so hard I cried several times, and I was cracking people up all night.<br /><br />I smoked about 40mg of DMT about 8 hours in, it was a mostly normal DMT trip, and was still tripping pretty hard when I came down off of it.<br /><br />I was pretty exhausted when I finally laid down in bed, but I can&#039;t honestly say it was any more tired then I would expect to be after having a very eventful day and a decent drive before we even started tripping, plus we got a good walk in during the trip. I was up for about 24 hours before I went to bed, slept for 2.5-3, and had a very pleasant day on Sunday, no noticeable effects other than a overall good, introspective, kinda spacey trippiness throughout the day.<br /><br />All in all, a very enjoyable experience I cannot wait to repeat (probably in the 14-15mg range this time). Highly recommended, just titrate your dose carefully!<br /><br />Album art in question:<br />http://www.echoparkrecords.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/poolside-night.jpg<br /><br />Highly recommended mixtape:<br />http://soundcloud.com/poolside/night-mixtape

				So, 2C-P has become one of my favorites. at the 8-10mg dose, after the 3+ hour come on, my friends and I have always had just an amazing time with it. Feels good physically, spiritually, and mentally, opens you up a bit (not like MDMA or 2C-B), and last for a solid 8 hours after first effects are felt.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to hitting the 13-14mg dose, see how quickly the effects ramp up.<br /><br />Buy some, tell your friends, and have a blast with this valuable compound!
