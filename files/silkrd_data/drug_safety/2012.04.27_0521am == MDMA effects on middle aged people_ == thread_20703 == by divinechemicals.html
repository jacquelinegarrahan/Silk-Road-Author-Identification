				This is kind of a weird question, but I&#039;m not sure where else I could find this information. Basically I know a woman who is somewhere in her late 40s/early 50s. She and her boyfriend who are of similar age used to be big in the hippie drug scene in the 70s, but they haven&#039;t done anything in a while. She knows that I have an MDMA contact and wants to try rolling with her boyfriend. I&#039;m fine with this, but does anyone know if there are bad effects that can come about from being that old and taking MDMA? I don&#039;t want to accidentally give her a heart attack or something. She has no health problems as far as I know. I&#039;ll probably give them 175 mg each so I don&#039;t overdo it.

				Personally I believe mdma is a young persons drug although I have heard of older (40+) taking it. But think about it. They probably haven&#039;t worked out in over 10 years and if they have they probably didn&#039;t get their heart rate to 160bpm for 3-4 hours continuously. Kids are usually somewhat active but a 40 yo cardiovascular system probably shouldn&#039;t be subjected to those kinds of conditions. Then you also have to take into effect if she&#039;s a smoker or not. How high is her blood pressure. Will she be prone to the mild panic attacks that newbies sometimes get when they first try X which could send her body over the edge.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve never done bk-mdma but that might have a less intense effect than mdma. I&#039;ve heard it was milder. I&#039;d recommend not giving her anything but if you do make sure its a low dose and go from there.<br /><br />Stay safe!<br />Xander

				I&#039;ve always thought of mdma as an older person&#039;s drug.&nbsp; By older, I mean late 20s thru late 30s.&nbsp; While there is some heart rate increase, pure &quot;molly&quot; tends to be very relaxing when dosed properly.&nbsp; Us older folks (I&#039;m 35) love the euphoria as well as the increased sociability it brings.&nbsp; Given the right conditions, the sex is fantastic also!&nbsp; There are much worse drugs out there for someone getting up there in age (meth/coke).<br /><br />I think part of the reason that there is so much crap out there on the street (in the States anyway) is that a lot of the pressed pills and even powder &quot;molly&quot; is cut with speed, caffeine, or some other crap that there is an expectation that X is going to fill you with insane amounts of energy to dance the night away.&nbsp; In that sense, it does become safer for the younger crowd.<br /><br />On the flip side, some young adults (late teens/early 20s) are still in the later stages of brain development.&nbsp; You could argue that pure mdma may have a chance of causing more permanent detrimental effects if not used responsibly.<br /><br />I personally know users from 23-56 and all of them love it.&nbsp; I think if you&#039;re an otherwise healthy adult, the risks are relatively low.&nbsp; I think the important thing is to be smart about it and know your limits....and most of all, have fun!
