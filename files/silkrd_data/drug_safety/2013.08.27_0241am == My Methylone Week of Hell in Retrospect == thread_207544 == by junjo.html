				Hello all,<br />&nbsp;<br />Just thought I would post a quick few things. If you don&#039;t remember me, I was the dude who freaked out and threw a bitch fit on the forums after a bad experience with methylone.<br />1) I sincerely apologize for flipping the fuck out and creating unnecessary drama because one guy hurt my feelings. It was ridiculous, and mainly the product of my shit state of mind after that experience.<br />2) Over 3 weeks later, I am feeling much, much better. I&#039;m not nearly as angry/depressed anymore, the circulatory issues have seemed to gone (my knees look normal again), and I can function like a normal adult again.<br />3) I am going through a series of doctors visits in the next week to make sure that vitals are all OK. My heart rate is still a bit erratic, but my blood pressure is within the healthy range, thankfully. I should have EKG and blood tests back by friday, which will tell me if I really did any lasting damage, but it looks HIGHLY unlikely.<br /><br />TLDR; Sorry for being a little bitch. I don&#039;t think Methylone &quot;permafried&quot; me or anything ridiculous. It definitely screwed with me mentally a bit, considering the violent mood swings and anxiety I experienced in the week after use, but things are getting back to normal again.<br />You know your own body better than anyone else; Methylone definitely made me feel BAD, but it doesn&#039;t mean I was permanently harmed, and neither will it do the same to you.<br /><br />Just be careful as always, and as I&#039;ve said before, if you want MDMA, then buy MDMA. Methylone is similar but not even close to a replacement for MDMA. Once again, my apologies for being whiny bitch and a drama hound. I was in a very negative, angry state of mind. I&#039;ll let you all know the state of my cardiovascular system as soon as I hear about it.<br />

				glad to hear you&#039;re feeling better, some drugs have adverse effects on some people and you were right to share your negative experience with the community.

				Thanks. I&#039;m in no way saying that what the Dilbert guy did was right to do what he did, he&#039;s still a douche, but starting a shitstorm over it isn&#039;t exactly a great way of dealing with things.
