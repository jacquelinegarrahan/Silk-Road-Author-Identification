				Got some 3-MeO-PCP the other day, gonna do it tonight. No idea what the dose should be. heard one source say that between 20 and 40 mg was a good dose, but then I read on another forum only 7-8mg! Also is it more relaxing like MXE or K or more energizing like PCP or DXM? &#039;Cause I was gonna do it tonight, but I don&#039;t want to if it&#039;ll mean I have to call in sick tomorrow.<br /><br />Last, but not least, is it okay to take sublingualy?

				I was disappointed actually. I really didn&#039;t get that high off the K. I have a lot of mucus in my nose, like all the time pretty much, because of allergies so I think that might have something to do with it. Kind of a waste of K, really. K felt more relaxing, less like DXM. Didn&#039;t get anything really trippy. Worst part was the post nasal drip.

				maybe one day if I get a needle and I&#039;m comfortable using it, I&#039;ll try K again. But I&#039;m not going the insufflated route unless it&#039;s very small amounts.

				This was last night. I did the key bumps at about 3:00 in the evening, just to test my dose. Then did the larger amount at 8:30 later that day.<br /><br />edit: body sensation very similar to MXE. squarish, quantized, numbish. mild stomach discomfort most likely unrelated to the 3-MeO-PCP.

				insufflated whatever rest i could. not much. it&#039;s such a slow high. licked the rest away.<br /><br />this is different from the other dissociatives. everything&#039;s calm and slow and what-not. probably need a higher dosage next time.

It&#039;s like id DXM weren&#039;t weird as fuck. It&#039;s like the polar opposite of PCP. PCP is sort of a manic, paranoid, trippy high. This stuff, at least when taken sublingually, comes on slow, makes everything feel slow, and leaves slow. There was the body high that&#039;s found with other dissociatives, but it&#039;s just slower. I realized one of the &quot;rush&quot; feelings of dissociatives is actually the feeling of moving while you&#039;re standing in place. You could feel the movement occurring slowly. And DXM might make you feel like a robot, but this stuff makes you feel like a sloth. Your movements aren&#039;t robotoic, it&#039;s as if you&#039;re moving through jello.<br /><br />It&#039;s been really interesting experiencing a range of dissociatives. This was the simplest, cleanest, least complicated feeling dissociative I&#039;ve had. There wasn&#039;t a whole lot going on to it which isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. There just weren&#039;t that many changes in consciousness or anything. It&#039;s minimalist. And everything was slowed the fuck down.<br /><br />The one thing I noticed which started while on the drug and still this morning is it&#039;s antidepressant qualities. My SSRI gives me a warm blanket feel, but MXE improved my mood where depression wasn&#039;t working. DXM made me realize that I needed to make radical changes in my life and 3-MeO-PCP feels like the cleanest antidepressant I&#039;ve had yet. It makes everything seem so simple and basic and reassuring. Everything will turn out fine since life really isn&#039;t that complicated to begin with. Only problem is I couldn&#039;t sleep for shit. I will update you guys with how I feel after I finish my work day.
