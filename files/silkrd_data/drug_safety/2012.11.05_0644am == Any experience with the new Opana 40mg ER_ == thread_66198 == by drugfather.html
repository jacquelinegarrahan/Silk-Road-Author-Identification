				I wrote you a pm about it.<br /><br />There is a tool you get at Wallmart(among other places) it is called a dremel. It comes with several bits and cost around $40. The model everyone go&#039;s with is the dremel 200.<br /><br />You use the &quot;orange&quot; bit that comes with it. You get a bowl, hold the dremel in one hand and using any speed you take the pill in the other and grind it down. It will turn into a fine dust. You must do all of this in a deep bowl so that the powder ends up in it.<br /><br />You then use a paint brush or other brush and brush it on to a plate. Then you can either smoke it by putting it on foil or make a line and snort it.<br /><br />Also some(not many) make a parachute with it. You take a piece of toilet paper and put the powder inside and then make a little ball of paper around it and swallow. Then when that hits your stomach the paper will dissolve and your body won&#039;t have to take on the time release.<br /><br />There is a write up on the listing. There is also a TEC that Hatter26 does and sells.<br /><br /><br />To answer your question, I have over 25 people that have done this and reported to me. I myself too have tried it. It is not a&nbsp; new thing and has been around for about 5 mo.<br /><br />Hope that helps

				Like powersmoke said there is the issue of hard opana w/d ... and personally, I don&#039;t know if I like opana ... but I may not have enough experience with it to make a fair judgement ...<br /><br />I&#039;ve been clean for 4 years (on suboxone), but just got a 10mg Opana through SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t take suboxone for 2 days before I thought the opana would be here and I take a VERY small does of suboxone (1/8th of a 2mg tab) Anyway, I broke it into quarters to IV it ... and the first time I IV&#039;d it, there was the nice rush and euphoria ... and that was what I continued to do with the pill, IV quarters.&nbsp; Anyway, a couple hours after IV&#039;ing each time, I felt like shit ... now given this could be because I&#039;ve been on suboxone for so long or it could be because the oxymorphone is just sooo strong ... anyway I wished to myself I had gotten dilaudid&#039;s or even roxys.&nbsp; <br /><br />Opana was just becoming more common where I live when I stopped using 4 years ago, so I did have the chance to snort the old hexgon (or octagon, can&#039;t remember) 40mg opanas ... at the time I was doing a LOT of dope and various rX pills (all IV), but with this Opana (it was one of the last things I did before I stopped) I just insuffulated about 1/2 of one and was HIGH for a LONG time ... hence my desire to try Opana again ... anyway, I might give Opana another short sometime since I didn&#039;t quite get the result I was looking for, but, like I said, I wished I&#039;d have gotten dilaudid for this round of revisiting my addiction.&nbsp; But, it seems like you already came to that conclusion, just thought I would offer my insight!
