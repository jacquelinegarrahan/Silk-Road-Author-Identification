				First and foremost i&#039;m not criticizing its use its like anything else if your not careful you pay but its especially unforgiving if you do not use caution and care.&nbsp; I do and have used it and will continue to do so but I just want everyone to be safe. One of my best friends went skiing and he took some G with him. From what some of my other friends and his girlfriend told me he was very unsafe and kept going out to his truck and took multiple caps throughout the day.&nbsp; Then they all went to bed and when she woke up he was dead lying next to her. He leaves a 4 year old daughter behind and its just really sad.&nbsp; &nbsp;They were multiple times we saw him either take a little too much when going out or when he passed out in his truck in my driveway thankfully after watching a couple of college football games.&nbsp; A number of us had some very direct and honest conversations with him and told him he needed to quit it if he wasn&#039;t going to be responsible. I guess maybe we should&#039;ve had a straight up intervention but we thought we had gotten it through to him but obviously we bear some responsibility for not doing more.&nbsp; Just everyone use some good sense when your doing this stuff and i know most people do but just be safe its so not worth risking your life by overdoing it.

				GHB can be EXTREMELY dangerous, even more so when combined with alcohol. I nearly lost a good friend to an unintentional overdose, and I&#039;ve had my own experiences of almost losing my shit while on that stuff. The dosage curve is very steep.<br /><br />In moderation, yes, GHB can be pretty fun, but the fun can turn into a hospital visit all to easily. I steer clear of it now.<br />

				Because of your post i decided to get some xanax instead. I know it isn&#039;t the best alternative, but at least the dose curve is for the most part predictable.

				Respect the drugs you are taking, if you don&#039;t know your bodies limits you probably shouldn&#039;t be indulging.<br /><br /><br />Simply enough. It&#039;s about maintaining a sense of level-headedness and clarity of mind ub being able to really experience drugs to their fullest potential imo.&nbsp;

				Hey organon,<br /><br />So sorry to hear about your loss bro. It&#039;s a hard one for sure. <br /><br />As a long-term vendor of GHB (pre-SR even) I feel moved to make a response here to help people understand better how to use it and thus hopefully avoid this kind of event again.<br /><br />GHB is actually very safe to use if some basic principles are followed. I have personally ingested 10g in a single dose (which is massively high for a 160 lb male) to test safety, and while it knocked me out cold quickly and I came around vomiting, I was fine otherwise.<br /><br />Basic Safety Rules:<br /><br />1. Use pharmaceutical grade GHB powder only. GHB powder is always clean whereas liquid may not be. Liquid GHB&#039;s may contain unreacted GBL (which will change the dosing dynamics - and is very heavy on the liver) or unreacted NaOH (which can burn you). Also it is easy for amateur kitchen chemists to make liquid GHB, and so quality may not be up to proper lab standards. The main reason to use powder though is that the dose can be known exactly, rather than guessed, as is the case with liquid.<br /><br />2. NEVER mix GHB with any CNS depressants. This includes alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methaqualone and ketamine - as well as other sedatives, hypnotics, sleeping pills, muscle relaxants etc. Not before, not during and not after. Leave at least 48 hours (and preferably longer) on either side of GHB use before/after using these. Interactions between GHB and these drugs are THE primary cause of all problems.<br /><br />3. Be cautious using GHB on a full stomach. The GHB will be absorbed a lot slower, causing one to potentially re-dose based on not feeling it. And then all of that GHB will finally kick in sometime later leading to a higher dose than one intended to take.<br /><br />4. If someone takes too much GHB (not in combination with the above-mentioned) and passes out, then let them be. Monitor them, put them on their side so if they do vomit it does not clog their airway, and let them sleep it off. It&#039;s not a problem, it&#039;s not a coma, it will be OK. If someone is &quot;twitching&quot; this is not anything serious but simply a response in the body (called myoclonus) which happens when someone is right on the edge of falling sleep - an indication that the dose has gone just a little too high.<br /><br />5. Dosing should be done progressively (perhaps 1g - 2g every 30 - 60 minutes, erring towards the lower dose and longer interval), rather than a larger dose all at once. That way people can adjust the dose based on how they are feeling.<br /><br />6. Leave at least 48 hours between GHB sessions.<br /><br />7. Maintain overall health through good diet, exercise and moderate (not excessive) drug use.<br /><br />If GHB is used with care then its effects (apart from the euphoria) will be benign and can even be positive. It is an endogenous neurochemical (i.e. it is produced naturally in the body), it metabolizes cleanly to carbon dioxide and water, and even stimulates the pituitary gland to release natural HGH - a very positive thing. As a drug it is metabolically one of the cleanest in existence.<br /><br />It is a precious substance, but life is more precious. So this post is in the hope that people will continue to use this with the care and consciousness it deserves - and which it requires. (There&#039;s a good, technically correct, article on GHB here for more information also: http://www.life-enhancement.com/magazine/article/76-the-truth-about-ghb-steven-fowkes-testifies-to-the-california-state-legislature-committee.)<br /><br />Blessings to you and to your friend as he begins the next phase of his eternal and mysterious life journey.<br /><br />BlueGiraffe<br />

				Thank you BlueGiraffe. I don&#039;t know if you read my response to the other thread you were in but you sound like you are pretty knowledgeable about G. That&#039;s what I was trying to get at that if you are a vendor you should at least try to provide people with the correct knowledge and follow through with it. It seems like you are. Someone please give this man/women some karma.

				I&#039;m sorry but I don&#039;t have sympathy for people who don&#039;t listen and ignore the warnings their friends give them...<br /><br />This is the face of addiction...when you totally disregard your own safety and wellbeing just to get high...when you selfishly and inconsiderately ignore the people who love and care for you....<br /><br />When push comes to shove you need to step in and take the drugs away from people who are putting themselves and others in harms way...<br /><br />I consider myself a strong willed person but still I never bring more drugs than I need or know that I can handle...that way even if the temptation to redose is strong, there are no more drugs to redose with and thus eliminating the potential for overdose....<br /><br />I always follow the guidelines for dosage from threshold to light to common to strong just so I can be familiar with the effects of each drug on each level....<br /><br />

				Thanks for this cautionary post, and I am quite sorry to hear about your friend. I have seen a few people go from blissed out happy to passed out and twitching (or vomiting everywhere) on G incredibly quickly. ALWAYS measure out your doses properly, give them enough time to kick in, and don&#039;t mix with booze!

				Hi, Am very sorry to hear about your friend. May he rest in peace. Good post and glad you put it up as important people are educated before taking drugs imo. Please don&#039;t hold yourself responsible in anyway (as you mentioned in your post). We are all responsible for our own actions. I too have lost a few friends from drug overdoses or accidents and it&#039;s a terrible waste. I&#039;ve also nearly been there too! I hope people learn from it so his death serves at least some purpose (I know that&#039;s not exactly comforting). It really isn&#039;t any of your responsibility as an &#039;addict&#039; or someone with drug problems will usually not stop until they are ready. We can only be there when they are ready, for support. We all know about hindsight...and it sucks big time!!<br /><br />My condolences to the family and friends he leaves behind. All the best + use safely peeps <br /><br />

				OP, I&#039;m so sorry (which I know sucks to hear) to read about this loss. I went through the exact same thing last year. If you need to talk about it, don&#039;t hesitate to PM me (in order to block spam, you must be my &quot;buddy&quot; first)<br />Know that you tried your best to help your friend, and in the end, it was not your fault! It was their choice to continue their dangerous behavior, unfortunately. Know that they don&#039;t have to deal with that aspect of existence anymore and believe they are free now. Time will not necessarily&nbsp; make things easier, but it will allow you to realize what great memories you hold and forgive both yourself and them.<br />Every chance you get, speak to them and let them know they are cared about. Grieve, it&#039;s ok that you do.<br />Never forget them. Recognize the lessons that they&#039;ve taught and will continue to teach you and those around you.<br />It could save a life though it meant the loss of your friend.<br />Regards,<br />SG.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83078.msg619292#msg619292">Quote from: gestaltassault2 on November 23, 2012, 10:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m sorry but I don&#039;t have sympathy for people who don&#039;t listen and ignore the warnings their friends give them...<br /><br />This is the face of addiction...when you totally disregard your own safety and wellbeing just to get high...when you selfishly and inconsiderately ignore the people who love and care for you....<br /><br />When push comes to shove you need to step in and take the drugs away from people who are putting themselves and others in harms way...<br /><br />I consider myself a strong willed person but still I never bring more drugs than I need or know that I can handle...that way even if the temptation to redose is strong, there are no more drugs to redose with and thus eliminating the potential for overdose....<br /><br />I always follow the guidelines for dosage from threshold to light to common to strong just so I can be familiar with the effects of each drug on each level....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;ve never lost someone that you were intimately close with, have you? I can honestly not believe you if you have lost someone and can post the above. I will say that you are right in that it is selfish to ignore those that love you...but it&#039;s not like it is the other person&#039;s fault for not being able to help the addicted. You might be a strong person, but not every one is. Regardless, I&#039;d never wish that kind of understanding on you or anyone close to you. With respect, I wish myself and many others didn&#039;t lose someone in the we did just to learn that you cannot control another person&#039;s life and addictions...
