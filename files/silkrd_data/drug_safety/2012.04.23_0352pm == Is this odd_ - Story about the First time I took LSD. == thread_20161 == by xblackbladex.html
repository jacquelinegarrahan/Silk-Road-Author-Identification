				I&#039;ve done salvia multiple times and shrooms multiple times, so keep in mind I have had my fair share of trips. But this was odd.<br />I picked up 5 tabs of lsd for myself along with 4 friends that picked up 4 each. I&#039;ve never done LSD before and they all have(multiple times), so I thought to myself, wow I&#039;m going to be tripping the hardest out of the group. We all took our tabs at the same time. Within an hour or two everyone in the room was tripping. I didn&#039;t feel a thing though! My friends were saying that they were seeing wavy colors and all sorts of odd visual things. I however on the other hand did not see or feel any different. The only thing I can say that had SEEMED to change, was that when I went outside colors seemed brighter and I felt like some of my senses were a little amplified. I was wondering if it was just bad stuff? But my friends were all tripping hard and can&#039;t really say the same.<br /><br />Maybe they were just faking it? I don&#039;t know, very strange though. When I was told about this site I got excited cause I figured I can definitely get some powerful stuff through here, which I will be doing soon. I just can&#039;t seem to wrap my head around the fact that I didn&#039;t really experience anything exceptionally noticeable.

				When I take LSD, if I take 2 hits or less no visual effects really occur other than colors seeming brighter, contrasts stronger, and the edges and details of objects appearing in higher resolution and greater quantity (for example, looking at my face).

If I stare at a textured ceiling and let my eyes unfocus, the ceiling will tend to drift or swirl around as if it were a fluid.<br /><br />LSD is something that doesn&#039;t really affect me— I affect it.

				First time I took it, I got some enhanced colors around me for about an hour (just brighter hues, but no patterns), and then I was capable of driving again. It was really quite underwhelming. I know my source better, now, though, and so I believe he actually did a Morning Glory Seed extraction rather than getting real LSD (he also way overcharged me, but that&#039;s a different story; I avoid him like the plague, now). I&#039;ve since had much better experiences with the vendors here on SR, and I must in particular give a shout-out to Dr.Amsterdam, who provided me my first great acid trip. I&#039;d say give it another shot, but I&#039;d also suggest not taking 5 tabs your first time. The come-up can be pretty harsh IMO.

				Hmmm, interesting. I remember vaguely something I read in one of Stanislaf Grov&#039;s books about psychedelic therapy. No offence there :) I think most of the people on silk road are saner than the average guy you see on the street. Anyway, he had about 2500 therapeutic sessions using LSD and he found out that some people really have high barriers against the effects of LSD - in the beginning. He stated some individuals where functioning absolutely normal at doses of 1000mics and higher... unbelievable to me. My first trip were 2 tabs of 80-100 mics and at the peak I thought: Oh man, that is so intense, when is it going to stop? <br /><br />I think if you do it more often there could be one point where these barriers brake, no idea how to influence that though. Be careful if you order some stuff from SR. I have experience with these<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/25fcebf324<br /><br />and one of them is usually enough for me. 1/3 of one trip gives me a nice body high and intense emotional capacity.<br /><br />What are your experiences on shrooms? Allthough I never did those I heard that Psilocybin and LSD usually have very similar effects which also experienced users can not differ. If you tripped on those that would be an evidence that the tabs you took were just very low dosed.

Regarding the barrier thing that sounds pretty right on, I remember the first time I tried weed, shrooms and even salvia I didn&#039;t feel anything. The 2nd and 3rd time I hit up mushrooms I tripped intense. Not a lot of visual hallucinations(although on the 3rd shroom trip; the room I was in turned completely purple lol.) But I pretty much had very deep, emotional trips. Oh yeah and on the 3rd trip I could swear I had some synesthesia-like experiences, I&#039;m pretty much positive I had them but it&#039;s weird because now I can&#039;t remember what it was like at all whatsoever. The only problem with me and shrooms is that they make my stomach turn like crazy, so I&#039;ll have like 5 hours of straight constipation which kind of ruins the trip lol.<br /><br />And yeah I love reading into those oldschool science research articles and watching those youtube videos of experiments in the 40&#039;s and 50&#039;s. A lot of the people they experimented on had a lot of problems before going into the trips and a decent amount of them came back a little more&nbsp; enlightened I guess you could say.<br /><br />Even today they&#039;re talking about the possibilities of LSD being a cure for alcoholism. I do agree that it is a strong drug that shouldn&#039;t be legally distributed just yet but I feel like if they do more research and figure out a way to prep a person&#039;s body for taking it and not having any bad reactions, good old Albert Hoffman&#039;s medication could do some good lol.<br /><br />

				how recently did you last use shrooms? I&#039;ve had friends build up crazy tolerances to shrooms that lasts weeks. Everyone is different and you might be one of those types. There is a cross tolerance between LSD and psilocybin/psilocin so if your tolerant to shrooms and have been tripping on those for a while, don&#039;t be surprised if you have to take much more acid hits than your friends to get the same effects. Just my .02, don&#039;t think your experience was odd at all, I personally always have to take shit ton more psychedelics then my friends to get the same effects.

				Yeah I have done shrooms multiple times but not recently. The last time I did em was probably my senior year of high school(like 4 years ago). I am a big guy though(6&#039;4&quot;, 215 lbs) and almost every drug I do usually gets my friends way more fucked up than me. I mean for god sakes I took a 60 of morphine a couple of weeks ago and my friends were on their asses. I went out and bought beer and 2 percs lol. They call me &quot;The Moose&quot;. I&#039;m not sure if body size has much of an effect on lsd though. <br /><br />Whatever though enough with the pondering, at the end of the week I&#039;m probably gonna grab some of that good stuff from Dr Amsterdam and see whats really good!

				Glad you could get some info out of my post. Another intersting thing is this:<br /><br />&quot;The only problem with me and shrooms is that they make my stomach turn like crazy, so I&#039;ll have like 5 hours of straight constipation which kind of ruins the trip lol&quot;<br /><br />My stomach reacts funnily to LSD. When I get hungry, it feels empty, but without the familiar feeling of being hungry... if you know what I mean. It feels like if there is a void in my body, exactly where my stomach is. My stomach somehow gets disconnected from my usual body feeling. But somehow I can &quot;reboot&quot; this connection by eating small amounts of food (nothing too heavy, and no fruit juices which have a lot of acid) and after some time, maybe an hour or so, I have my stomach-feeling back and can eat as usual. Which is quite nice because food tastes just 1m times better on acid :P

				I never knew about 2C until coming across SR. I&#039;m glad you brought that up. What is it exactly? What does it do to you?<br />Shit while I&#039;m at it, what are any of these generic/alternative drugs that I see on the market? Like that one called gnome or something like that, etc etc. <br /><br />And since were on the lsd discussion, I was also wondering if anyone has bought anything from AfternoonDelight and could vouch for him as a good seller?

				Oh yeah I&#039;m also finally recovering from a stress-induced anxiety period that I&#039;ve been making great progress with over the past couple months. So I&#039;m on k-pins and prozac right now. The first time I did the cid I wasn&#039;t on anything(i figured i&#039;d mention that in advanced because if i gave off the idea i was on those drugs while taking the cid some of you may have made a correlation between the ssri-k-pin-lsd combo and my weak trip) but when I pick up the heavier stuff, I&#039;m probably going to keep the pills on hand just as a precaution measure. But if I were to combine the cid with any one of those drugs how do you think it would effect my experience?<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely keeping them on-hand to ease myself if I reach any point of having a bad experience(ie: bad comedown, etc)<br />but I&#039;m also considering taking them beforehand just so I can go into with a super relaxed mind-state.<br /><br />Sorry about the TMI and TMQ lol.<br /><br />

				2C-I i found a bit stimulating. Felt like i was wired up off some caffeine. When you say crazy stimulation. Are you referring to a speed high such as an amphetamine? If so then, no 2C-I doesn&#039;t cause crazy stimulation. I don&#039;t know about 2C-E since i haven&#039;t tried it yet. I heard that 2C-B can be slightly stimulating too.
