				I last took heroin at 7 am yesterday but have been using poppy tea to try and keep the w/d&#039;s at bay. The tea is barely working as I still have the shits, constant yawning, runny nose and upset stomach.<br /><br />I have some subutex coming. My question is: how long should I wait before taking it if I&#039;m already kind of in w/d&#039;s? My last dose of poppy tea was at 7 this morning and I&#039;ve been advised to wait 12 hours since taking any opiates before using the subs. Is this correct?

				I&#039;ve been an opiate user for quite some time, and from my experience, if you can feel any hint of withdrawals, you should be fine. I think 12 hours is MORE than enough time. I think doctors who are taking patients in for the first time tell them to abstain for 12 to 24 hours in order to better evaluate the patients reaction to buprenorphine, but I think its A LOT harder to send yourself into withdrawal by way of early bupe ingestion than the medical community would like people to believe.

				12hours after should be completely fine just don&#039;t make yourself hurt even more by using a sub close to your stuff, or while it still might have you feeling nice...you&#039;ll be even worse off with sickness, etc.&nbsp; Best,

				This totally depends on what you&#039;re taking.&nbsp; Tea is long lasting, so wait as long as you possibly can.&nbsp; I agree that your symptoms sound strong enough, but if you take it too early, you&#039;ll know it in about 1/2 hour.&nbsp; Waiting almost 24 hours wasn&#039;t enough last time, and it&#039;s an experience I&#039;ll remember for the rest of my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I wouldn&#039;t go less than 24.&nbsp; Once you do it wrong, you&#039;ll be sure to do it right next time.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the advice. Will probably wait as long as I can tolerate it. I thought the subs would have arrived by now but bloody xmas post seems to be backed up in my part of the uk.
