				Title: <strong>IV Opana Dose ?</strong><br />

				Just received some IV ready Opana (oxymorphone) from Hatter&nbsp; :) and figured I&#039;d ask what a good starting dose is, as I just IV&#039;d 70 units ( ~ 1 mg) and am pretty disappointed.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Note I have no opiate tolerance as a result of dependence -- despite going the IV route when I use opiates, I only use occasionally, not habitually -- but that I have a bit of a natural tolerance. What&#039;s a good euphoric dose for me as a 190 lb male with little tolerance?

				Go with 2 mg then every hour or so drop 25 cents.

				Well the thing I&#039;d be worried about is the consistency of the extract... He&#039;s obviously not a pharmaceutical company. How do you know It&#039;s as strong as he says it is? Personally I doubt the guy but he seems to have good feed back and a fan club so maybe I&#039;m wrong... the $300 a gram or whatever he wants for black tar though is an absolute joke. There have been reports of black tar being up to 80% pure but I believe that was actually Mexican brown powder. Pure diacetylmorphine is white. If you mix 800 mg of H with 200 mg of the blackest shit possible I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be the color or consistency of tar. A theory I heard is the heroin isn&#039;t based out after being cooked in acetic anhydride and it&#039;s just mostly cooked off. This causes some reaction with oxygen.. I get pretty damn good black tar (80-85 a gram) and if you cut a nugget of it, the inside is brown powder that will soon turn black and gooey. As far as I know no one on the net knows 100% for sure how tar is made...<br /><br />Sorry for the tangent... To get back to your question, a hospital dose of oxymorphone is 1 mg IV. It is 9-10x stronger than morphine. I think 2-3 mg is a good recreational dose for someone without tolerance.

I think the description reads 1mg/ml. So you took 7/10th&#039;s of a dose. I would suggest 2-3mg<br /><br />But I agree with the above, it&#039;s likely not at that concentration unless he is a chemist or such. Let me know how it works tho. It&#039;s one of the greatest rushes I hear.

				I just thought about it some and it&#039;s really hard to believe he&#039;s measuring things so accurately. First off I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;s extracting from pills. How is he standardizing his extractions? Second one mg is awful small... You&#039;re putting a lot of trust in a bathtub chemist while using a very powerful opiate. What if It&#039;s stronger than said concentration? For a naive user a couple mgs could be the difference between death and a good time... This is why IVing drugs scares me. It all goes in at once...

While I agree I&#039;d be sensative to ordering from a chemist like him, I trust him. After all it&#039;s not that difficult to extract 10mg of Opana from a 15mg IR pill, remove all the fillers and binders, and then weigh out 10mg of that probable 12mg yield, and then dissolve it into 10ml of H20 that is anti-bacterial. I know I could certainly do it with ease. Whalah, 1mg/ml solution of 10mg. Not to hard. As long as you know how to extract. <br /><br />And even if snorting drugs, it &quot;all goes in at once&quot;. I think you meant to say the BA goes up significantly so there is less margin for error. <br /><br />And it wouldn&#039;t be hard to standardize this extraction. Get 10 15mg IR pills, and do one big extraction, mix with water, shake, and good to go. +/-.1mg I&#039;d say. IF he&#039;s competent.<br /><br />

				Well I snort black tar mixed in water and I snort a little bit at a time. What I mean is by dosing a bit at a time, if you have a strong batch, you&#039;ll know it before you die... With shooting its all at once. I guess not the best argument but I still don&#039;t like needles :)<br /><br />For some reason I was thinking he was using the er pills. They reformulated them recently and they are supposed to be really tough. I heard of a case where a girl was snorting the new OP oxy and the binders built up in her nose and sinus. The docs said it looked like cement in there... She had to have surgery. Well, that&#039;s what I heard... it&#039;s believable though considering how hard those things are. If you pop one, you&#039;ll poop out a ghost pill. If your stomach can&#039;t even break the pill done fully then that&#039;s saying something!<br /><br />I guess with the ir pills it&#039;d be a lot easier. Still though, I&#039;m not sold... Dunno maybe I&#039;m being stubborn... I&#039;m just starting to get into chemistry and to get an extract of 12 mg with 10 mg om in it would take some skill... I think. You&#039;d have to find solvents that dissolve the om and not the binders or vice versa. And if you do that, doing a big batch, why would you lose 1/3rd? Even still is he testing his batches to see how much om is in there? Even the best chemists make mistakes. Lastly, if it&#039;s so easy, why not do it yourself and skip his insane mark up? And if it is so easy, why such a high mark up? I guess the last question is easy to answer... Because he&#039;s a drug dealer and people will pay it.

And making IV ready vials. And pure snort-able powder for you.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />You hit the nail on the head with he marks them up because people will pay. Look at the prices for Oxycodone for damn sake.<br /><br />Also, it takes time to do these extractions. Especially if he doesn&#039;t have a vaccum distil and filter, or if he&#039;s not using a proper lab setup (this can easily be done as &quot;kitchen chemistry&quot;, at least with the IR compounds) I used to extract pure d-amph from my Dextro&#039;s all the time. It took a few days because I used gravity filtration, but once that part was done it was an easy B/A extraction. Dried it in the microwave. Didn&#039;t re wash, but if I were making vials I surely would.<br /><br />And I would certainly test yield. I would try and get the highest tho.<br /><br />We&#039;ll see, I may offer some of these. If I can get raw OM for cheap.

				Good point on the a/b... Didn&#039;t even think of that. Well if you can get some decently priced oxymorphone, I&#039;ll definitely try some, never have. Even if It&#039;s not well priced I have to try some at least once :-) Doubt I&#039;ll switch from the H though... Even I&#039;d price wasn&#039;t a consideration. I think I like the &quot;dirty&quot; mix of alkaloids better than pure ones.
