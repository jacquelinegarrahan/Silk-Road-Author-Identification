				If anyone needs any body building (steroid, training, diet) advice, feel free to ask me.<br /><br />if you could include some info, that would be uselful, eg. stats (age, height, weight, training exp, previous cycle exp), a brief description of your diet and training regime, and what your goals are.<br /><br />to get things going, here is a good first cycle for anyone (except females):<br /><br />week 1-12 testosterone enanthate/cypionate 500mg/week (split 2x 250mg pins 3.5 days apart)<br />week 1-14 Arimidex .25mg EOD (every other day)<br />week 1-14 HCG 500iu/week (split 2x 250iu)<br />week 15-18 PCT (starts 14 days after last enanthate pin, or 18 days after last cypionate pin)<br />Nolvadex 40/20/20/20<br />Clomid 100/50/50/50 or Toremifene 120/60/60/60 (i prefer torem)<br /><br />PCT dosages are per day, so eg. nolva week 1 is 40mg everyday, then next 3 weeks 20mg every day.<br /><br /><br />you can PM me if you don&#039;t want to talk on the open forum..<br /><br />IMPORTANT: steroid use for people under the age of 25 is not recommended due to a developing endocrine system,<br />but i am not here to judge, as long as you are an adult (over 18, i will not give steroid advice to you if you are under 18..), you are old enough to make your own choices..<br /><br />p.s. if you like my advice, donations would be appreciated :)<br /><br />1Gb2hpSfN2YcNtLZ8UFG23GJjnavsz5wrv

				Ditch the HCG.&nbsp; Using arimidex on your first cycle without having sides is just retarded, once you take it you can&#039;t cycle without it anymore. Just take it when you get sides.
