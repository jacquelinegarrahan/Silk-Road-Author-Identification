				Just started thinking about it yesterday 01/19/2013 been thinking on how to spread mdma for 6 months charity seems like best idea I&#039;d start and grow it for some time with money from selling mdma on silk road when i figure out how to make it (any help). <br /><br />I&#039;d like to not only reduce harm to those using drugs but also increase the good feeling drugs give and/or decrease bad feeling more. I&#039;d like to increase use of drugs that have positive overall effects on feeling. <br /><br />This post seems like it could become damming evidence so ill never mention my charity&#039;s name but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s enough so if anybody has any good suggestions post them otherwise ill have to remove this post before I get the charity started any cops or narcs well ya I want to spread drugs that have positive overall effects on feeling but its a charity so I might just stick to harm reduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t want to help immoral criminals so I hope I can get people to make or grow drugs or possibly get them off silk road.<br /><br />&nbsp;Mostly I&#039;d like to concentrate on increasing mdma use as priority number 1 and reducing mdma related harm as priority 2 because as far as I know mdma has the most positive overall effect on feeling.<br /><br />Ok the easy way to start a charity is to put up a website (it only cost like 30$ for a year) then put a donate to you button on their/there (finished). Ok so your not out of the unlikely yet so i&#039;d say video tape everything you do(headcam comon) and document stuff if it might be useful.<br /><br />&nbsp;The best way to do that would be to make a media scandal that people have been lied to about mdma destroying brain cells no matter what when it&#039;s easy to avoid brain damage and that this false info has destroyed peoples brains health and killed people. Just billboards commercials and ads ext. which would be slow and costly but if I get lucky then I&#039;ll get a media scandal and&nbsp; billboards commercials and ads might help that. It would seem like only 5% chance of a media scandal happening in the U.S. just my opinion. Idk about other country&#039;s chances if the media spreads false info on drugs then its unlikely that they would make a scandal about themselves I realize now but some media might be willing to scandalize other media. I think that a media scandal would be a lucky break still worth working toward in conjunction with ads not sure about media scandal only projects like looking for a specific news channel that hasn&#039;t spread false info. Not really well known or rich enough or whatever to cause a media scandal directly more of a future project.<br /><br />The other topics I&#039;ve made are &quot;spreading mdma , changing anti mdma laws , evidence that mdma ecstasy is safe&quot;.

				&nbsp;Everyone who needs MDMA will find it. One way or another.&nbsp; <br />Charity? You want people to send you money for what?<br />&nbsp;Media Scandal? <br />Harm reduction posters? <br />Advertisement? on the streets?<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry mate... Get off the roll for a week and think things over... You want to change Babylon. You want to change hundreds of years of brainwashing. You want to change human nature.&nbsp; With stupid methods. <br />You can shout all you want. Your words will get stuck in the earwax and bounce right back. Like a crazy &quot;the end is near&quot; shouting homeless person. <br />Sheep is sheep, morons will always be morons. <br /><br />I know you mean well and you just want to share the love but its not gonna happen. <br />Here is what you can do if you can get the funds: start making huge amounts of premium product, start pressing pills like a madman and mail every person on the planet a hit. That would be fuckin revolutionary.

Many people want to get messed up on drugs they know are harmful so the government is the enemy (even morally) prohibition on alcohol didn&#039;t work and the government stopped so why can&#039;t people do the same thing for other drugs even all drugs.
