				I saw this listing on SR for blue meth.. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0e4a85750d<br />At first I thought it was a joke or a scam, but the seller seems to have pretty decent feedback.<br />Can the blue additive or whatever makes it turn blue (probably food coloring ?) be harmful?<br />And 98% purity? Is street meth ever that pure, or is that wishful thinking?

				Oh well, i suppose breaking bad inspires some people to do business. <br /><br />The color is probably just food colorant, but it would be possible to have a sample analyzed and see how much meth is in there, as well as to determine what makes it appear blue. <br /><br />As far as science goes no proper synthesis route with proper purification should produce meth in any other color than white/clear. Actual meth may be tan/brown/yellow due to impurities, but the substance itself is colorless and can be crystalized into transparant crystals giving it its street names like &#039;glass&#039; or &#039;ice&#039;.

				The retarded preconception that the reduction of methylamine/phenyl-2-propanol to methamphetamine results in blue crystals is one of the reasons I hate that show...<br /><br />Firstly, the reaction yields racemic meth, as P2P has no chiral center, and therefore, no stereoisomers.&nbsp; Racemic meth is an amorphous powder, not a crystal.<br />Sure, there are some fancy organometallic variations that can be used to yield chirally pure meth, but anyone who has the ability, and access, to the precursors required is probably already using the L-PAC route anyways...<br /><br />Secondly, although I&#039;m not 100% sure(mainly because I wasn&#039;t a lazy fucker with my post-workup&#039;s so I never had a dirty product) I don&#039;t think its possible to get tan/brown/yellow methamphetamine HCl.&nbsp; At least, I have never seen anything other than white snowstorms when gassing the meth out.

				I&#039;m not really sure why they do not show real world reactions in these shows - perhaps spreading such information is illegal in the US, perhaps it is because it actually isn&#039;t that easy and complexity doesn&#039;t help the story along. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the mythbusters special on breaking bad a few weeks ago, and there they tried to replicate the scenario of dissolving a body in hydrofluoric acid, and the idea that doing that in a metal bath tub would somehow result into the tub failing and the whole thing eating through a couple of floors, ending up in the basement. <br /><br />Obviously this does not work in reality, as HF is extremely hazardous/toxic, it is not a strong or very oxidizing acid at all.<br /><br />In at attempt to &#039;replicate the results&#039; they switched to a different reagent, which consisted of mostly sulfuric acid (mentioned as such on the show), and a &#039;special ingredient&#039;, which was not named on the show. From the footage i&#039;d conclude that this &#039;special substance&#039; was nitric acid, although hydrogen peroxide would have been very interesting too.<br /><br />What i wonder about is why they do not name these chemicals (there have been several similar examples in previous episodes). Is it illegal to do so on US television? That would seem very odd as they do often enough mention what explosives and in what quantity those are used for other scenes. <br />

				you are probably right regarding the second ingredient being nitric acid.&nbsp; H2SO4 + HNO3 is more commonly known as piranha solution.<br /><br />I&#039;d say the reason why they don&#039;t give the name of it is to save themselves from litigation when stupid people do stupid shit.<br /><br />

				Piranha etch actually is sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide, and is one of the few mixtures that can actually attack carbon. It is sometimes used to remove residue in the lab from reaction vessels that cannot be cleaned otherwise.<br /><br />From the footage i think they must have used nitric acid as the additive though... just looking at the clouds of vapor coming out i&#039;d say those were nitrous oxides. Piranha etch is a really nasty mixture, and would probably have exploded on contact with the pig cadaver featured on the show. <br /><br />But what is the point of keeping it a &#039;secret&#039;: you can easily find out that the &#039;special additive&#039; must have been either nitric acid or hydrogen peroxide. Anyone trying to do this at home could try both, though i would recommend starting with the nitric acid ;)<br /><br />Breaking bad could show the full synthesis of meth too - its not something that is secret in any way, anyone could google the reactions involved in minutes, although making them work on a practical scale is difficult. They should just leave out the part that actually is difficult if they want people to prevent re-creating the chemistry on such shows.
