				Ive taken adderall for a couple years for ADHD but recently moved and having trouble finding a Dr. to get me my normal meds. In meantime I ordered some very high grade Amphetamine from a well known vendor. Works very well but its almost too strong (not too pure, no such thing as too pure) but its too hard to measure because of the micro amount I take...<br /><br />Id like to cut it and fill gelcaps with exact amounts so I always know exactly what dose I take. I want to cut it because its so potent I can hardly measure the tiny tiny bits I need accurately on a good scale.<br /><br />Whats the best/safest thing I can use to cut it with for oral administration? I want something similar in molecular size/weight so it will mix in power form without either substance settling...&nbsp; Any ideas on best way to go about this?

				why do you need to cut at all?&nbsp; Maybe if you really do need to cut, perhaps some high potency anti-oxidant or concentrated energy gluco-something form a sports store, at least you&#039;ll get something out of it then.<br /><br />Do not ever ever ever ever cut or mix with caffeine or any other stimulant.&nbsp; Try not to mix amph&#039;s with any other drug full stop.<br /><br />Try having beetroot juice instead to re-open the blood vessels which stimulants constrict.

				Just an update here... <br /><br />I ended up getting a good scale so that will help in the future fyi Ive been talking about BM&#039;s new pink batch in case anyone was wondering. Here&#039;s the odd thing though. On day 3 it stopped working at any dose. So I have had to stop taking all AMP. Unlike adderall which I take everyday and still feel the effects everyday I was micro-dosing all work day long, no binging, eating right and sleeping well with vitamins etc.. Wouldn&#039;t take it for more than 12 hours straight but by day 3 I would still be in a tired funk after 1st dose, so Id dose again and didn&#039;t really pick me up, so Id dose again and get an then only gert an hour pickup etc, etc... By the end of day 3 I clearly had built up a much larger tolerance than I have ever with adderall so I decided to stop and not waste anything... I was taking between 5-7mg per dose 3-4 times per day until last day which was maybe double or triple 4X that amount before I said screw it, and stopped.<br /><br />I saw a review from someone said that they also felt with BM&#039;s gear they needed to constantly redose also and thought that was interesting...<br /><br />So What im wondering is why would I build a tolerance to clean/pure amp-sulph and not to pharm mixed- amps? Does that seem strange to anyone or is this typical of non pharmaceutical grade AMP?

The different mixtures of amphetamine salts affect dopamine, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent (at clinical doses) serotonin receptors at different rates. For example, if you&#039;re used to taking dex, you&#039;re largely releasing dopamine, and to a lesser extent than adderall, epinephrine (some of the released dopamine also converts to epinephrine). So if you were to switch from dex to adderall, you would feel the peripheral effects caused by the adrenalin increase caused by the levo-amph.<br /><br />If you go from adderall to dex or meth, you&#039;ll notice that you will feel little peripheral effects at all from the dex and meth, as you would be tolerant to the epinephrine releasing effects, and since the activity in this synapse is affected far less in dex/meth, it is doubtful that you will notice any increase in adrenalin.

				What&#039;s the best way to take meth orally?&nbsp; You encapsulate in bees wax or something?&nbsp; You can&#039;t just mix it in water and drink on an empty stomach?&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve found around 20mgs is about right for me, more than that and the &#039;left over&#039; just seems to hang around doing nothing except giving me insomnia.<br /><br />I started with dex and that was good, I remember getting some good euphoria and motivation out of it. I did not realise the effects were so different between different types of amp?&nbsp; How is meth-amp different to dex-amp?<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with meth-amp was insomnia and eventually tolerance too, lack of euphoria and just not getting that nice feeling any more, but I think 40-50mgs orally was far too much for me.&nbsp; 20-30mgs seems like a good dose to last all day without come down and insomnia.

				Don&#039;t chase the meth euphoria. It&#039;s a lie. :P<br /><br />To take meth orally, just put it in a drink (that doesn&#039;t have vitamin C in it) and gulp it down! <br />I sometimes would put meth in about 1 liter of water and sip that throughout the day. Was a very nice and effective way to regulate my meth intake and keep the stimulation going throughout the day. Kinda like a self-regulated extended release :)

				So oral use is ok then?&nbsp; Stomach acids were not a problem for it, you did not have to mix with baking soda or other alkalising materia?&nbsp; Empty stomach is best?<br /><br />How much did you gulp down in a day, 20, 40, 60mgs type thing?&nbsp; Did you get insomnia if you kept it under say 50mgs or something?<br /><br />Yeah I got euphoria first time I think, may have been dexies though.&nbsp; Not since though.

				hi there,<br /><br />first of all I think that the best way to dose your self is to dilute it on a liquid, like water. Let&#039;s say you have a g and you want 7ug doses. So you dilute your g in 100 ml of water and take 700ul of it, 0.7 ml. You can freeze batches of those 100 ml... and it will stay safe!<br /><br />Meth is a methylated form of the amphetamine. So they are related, cousins, but meth is definitively stronger, I will say 5-10 times (personal perception).<br /><br />And the speed that you are getting from BM is not the same as the amphetamine you are getting from the pharmacy. Why? because the one from the pharmacy has to pass quality controls, etc, and the one that you are getting from the road, although it can be awesome, is not standarized&nbsp; as a product from the pharma industry. THat&#039;s one of the only good things that legal pharma has. the quality controls. <br /><br />Saying that, I am pretty sure that there is a really good speed (amphetamine sulphate) on the road. The only but is: because the synthesis is not standarized and not following certain protocols you will find your self dealing with some king of impurities (byproducts) that are not in the normal pharma. That will modify the way you feel. hope this helps<br /><br /><br />USalchemy<br />

				<br />[/quote]<br />Hey tintin23, your name seems familiar (amph thread? ;))<br /><br />Anyway, there&#039;s much wisdom in what you type. - For sure it&#039;s my mind lending the &#039;evil&#039; (I never said that! :P) to it all. <br /><br />That and the whole &#039;anti-Meth&#039; crusade going on. (in the US anyway)<br /><br />With good reason, a lot of this shit, is just that, - SHIT! :o&nbsp; - Probably high quality Meth, coming in from the Mexican superlabs, only to be &#039;cut&#039; and re-cystallized to look like the real thing. - The problem is, whatever they cut it with, is the shit that makes you feel like you&#039;ve been poisoned. <br /><br />I think out of 5 or six orders, only 2 vendors had quality. That was a nice clean, super euphoric high. Oral dosing seems best too. Well, I&#039;m glad to walk away with just a few &#039;tics&#039; leftover. <br /><br />Back to Amphetamineland for me. I like to speed, I just wasn&#039;t built for the Autobahn~! ;)<br /><br />&nbsp;8) Chip&nbsp; 8) <br />[/quote]<br /><br />you are right about the cuts, but I do not think cuts are evil... We have ego and supergo inside us just fighting for a place. <br />I agree that the degree of binging with meth is higher, but I also recognize that the high is weight higher. THe come down will be hell, and you will ask your self about why did you take that fucking half g last night. Believe me, as you, I have been there. but I can also recognize than is not a human problem, is a personal problem. And I still love my peers, and I want them as free as I want to be. <br /><br />And I selfish with this this but I only learn with my mistakes so I get this doubt to everybody<br /><br />:)

				No problem, I respect your opinion. <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re in EU? - Maybe better quality Meth there too?<br /><br />I only get my Amphetamine from the top 3, and they&#039;re all in EU. (is South Africa EU?)<br /><br />There&#039;s no amphetamine being made in the US. That should tell you something right there. <br /><br />Breaking Bad is fiction.

I think is the diffrence in the molecule. the same difference that after having kinky sex on meth, made me look for meth.<br /><br />And i didn&#039;t get it<br /><br />the sex was great, the feeling was great, but.... everybody should have its but<br /><br />And I did too much of speed tomite<br /><br /><br />

				Yeah Chip, Sorry to hear about what you went through. Ive been down dark similar roads when I was a &quot;young-in&quot; and I guess I learned some important lessons early to know where to draw the lines with addictive substances. Not to say I would never still make the same mistakes but Im aware that especially with AMP and Meth hcasing the &quot;high&quot; only brings you low. rather I try to regulate very carefully total dose and frequency and take breaks when I can,<br /><br />BTW&nbsp; - for anyone wondering those who do AMP or adderall tend to have very deficient magnesium levels which can cause the tolerance and receptors to stop functioning properly. Since starting AMP I have found that taking magnesium taurate at night (after all AMP effects are wore off) and getting a good night sleep has been amazing for avoiding tolerance buildup and withdraw symptoms! <br /><br />Make sure to take the magnesium taurate only at night or on days your not dosing AMP because thats when it is most effective to replenish receptors sensitivity to the AMP. One discovered, I would not even take AMP without a very good magnesium supplement!

				Its not that you cant, I read many sides as to why you can or should take them together. Some say it shortens the effects others say it potentates AMP.<br /><br />I know that Magnesium acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist and its just my personal opinion that in taking it during a down time or off period its more effective. I find that when taking large amounts at one time, as in vitamin or supplement form, I do so before bedtime to rest and &quot;reset&quot;

It is merely like a key that tells your brain to unlock&nbsp; some of the chemicals it keeps inside it&#039;s vaults. It&#039;s your own brain that made the substances giving you the high.&nbsp; Those chemical reserves will become exhausted after prolonged use of meth or amph , thus your brain needs to have raw materials&nbsp; and time , to continue production&nbsp; in order to refill those spent reserves. Sometimes this will cause certain food cravings, or thirst and oversleeping .<br /><br />BTW--&nbsp; Baking soda fucks&nbsp; up&nbsp; both of those chemicals&nbsp; ( stomach acid wont ruin&nbsp; it either ) when they contact. let the drug dissolve/ digest&nbsp; thoroughly before&nbsp; taking B-Soda// water. Plus&nbsp; Bsoda will help alkanalize the urine , which will help recycle&nbsp; &nbsp;the drug from&nbsp; the bladder before you piss it out.&nbsp; But it a;so needs&nbsp; time to do the filtrating process&nbsp; tha t removes the meth in the first place - approx 35% - 50%&nbsp; of the meth you last took is expelled in the next urination. Dont go overboard trying to alkanalize your urine- iit wont take much of a Ph&nbsp; shift for this to work,&nbsp; and may be so subtle a mechanism&nbsp; that&nbsp; you barely notice.

				ok so no more taking meth with baking soda, but take it long after it&#039;s been absorbed.&nbsp; Why not lemon juice or spirulina or even salad to alkalise the body?&nbsp; Does baking soda really work that well to alkalise the bladder?&nbsp; How much would you take, a few teaspoons every hour or so?<br /><br />And any thoughts on how to prevent dopamine or other neurotransmitter depletion, avoid down-regulation (which takes years to recover I hear) and recharge neurotransmitter levels?&nbsp; Obviously there&#039;s vitamin B, eggs and healthy meats..&nbsp; Anything else?<br /><br />How long can it take to recharge dopamine levels if you are taking high doses of vitamin B and eating lots of eggs and protein supplements?<br /><br />What if you use it every few days, or for a few days straight (orally say 40mgs most in a day, usually less, with normal sleep etc)?&nbsp; I feel a little light headed / foggy / demotivated today after dosing for a few days but nothing unbearable or that unpleasant.<br /><br />Also - what signs of addiction should one watch out for?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using this (in)consitently for about five months starting with dex then weekend oral meth which spread in to some week use.&nbsp; I do look forward to my next delivery, and while I don&#039;t feel a &#039;craving&#039;, the fact that I look forward to it and start planning it fairly quickly kind of concerns me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get a huge &#039;high&#039; off it, the effects are not that strong taking it orally I think compared to say snorting etc, but I do look forward to a running or other active type thing with some of this washing around.<br /><br />The other thing that I&#039;m keen to watch out for is neurotransmitter depletion and long term down-regulation.&nbsp; If anything that would totally suck having to wait months or years for neuro-transmitters or dopamine receptors to start returning to &#039;normal&#039;.&nbsp; But is that something that more heavy users generally need be more concerned with.<br /><br />For the whole time I&#039;ve been using meth (orally, around five months) I&#039;ve been loading up pretty hard on vitamin B&#039;s, protein and green supplements, meats / eggs etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s helped avoid damage and depletion, in addition to the active lifestyle.
