				Movies gave me a pretty inaccurate version of what &quot;tripping balls&quot; is actually like. After watching Tenacious D I pretty much expected that eating shrooms would have me soaring through the clouds atop of Sasquatch. Now that I have a little experience with them, and fucking love them to death, I&#039;m wondering if there is anything out there that would cause more lifelike hallucination? I&#039;ve been smoking a bit of DMT lately and haven&#039;t had a breakthrough yet, but I don&#039;t think that is going to be the sort of thing I&#039;m talking about. I&#039;m wondering if there is any hallucinogen out there that would actually make me see people that aren&#039;t there, clear as day right in front of my eyes like any real person? Or is this just a hollywood plot device? <br /><br />I think it would be terribly interesting to have a conversation with a product of my imagination

				No, nearly all psychedelics are more euphoric with strong visuals, unless you take some absurdly high dosage. Breakthrough on the DMT though. It&#039;ll be more overwhelming than you can imagine. And who you see and speak to there, is NOT a part of your imagination.

				I&#039;m thinking of having another go with the DMT right now, but I&#039;m not sure. I don&#039;t know why but I&#039;m pretty afraid of it, I haven&#039;t had anything that could even resemble a bad experience with it yet but I still get anxious just thinking about it.

				your set and setting is different compared to everyone else&#039;s, so is your brain physiology and the resulting psychology. in the end it&#039;s all about perception, some people (those who are really creative, the artists, I&#039;d say) may be more prone to seeing all those figments of their imagination. my 2 cents

				Dmt is amazing. First time i really tripped balls was dmt. Cause i took 1 tab of acid a year before which because it was rc or weak, plus tripping first time with someone else, made it weird. Then i took 2g of mushrooms by myself in the country at night in a open field while it was sprinkling. The lights from the city a few miles away made the clouds constantly change colors. I was really fucked up on that trip haha. I did trip balls but obiously not like dmt.<br /><br />But I took dmt the third time I tripped and it took away all the parinoia i had about anything, including psychedelics and going crazy.&nbsp; DMT really is the refresh button which everyone needs at least a couple months. But forsrue a good LSD/shroom trip a couple months as well. Got to keep your brain worth visiting haha.<br /><br />But don&#039;t be afraid. It&#039;s all right. Just listen to Welcome to the Machine while doing DMT tho. YOU WILL THANK ME AFTER HAHA :D<br /><br />OR do it do the song DMT by shpongle. YOU WILL ALSO THANK ME AFTER haha.<br /><br />Drugs are amazing just moderation is key or they will take control of you.

				This is gonna sound crazy but if you want real weird hallucinations take one who bottle of Dramamine. I believe its 12 total.<br /><br />I ate some when I was younger and skipping school chilling in some woods. After about 30 minutes I saw the AOL guy crawling over leaves and a broom in pot but no witch(this was small like the size of a cup). After this Isee a cop car pulling into the woods. I run and hide in a shed, I can hear the cops talking to my family telling them Im on drugs skipping school ect.<br /><br />&nbsp;I of course start freaking after what felt like 20 mins I decide im gonna bust out and make a run for it. I do and to my amazement no one is there.<br /><br />It was actually pretty fun and I ended up walking home and chilling. Its not a scary trip or anything but you will see weird things. I never did it again but my friends did and I have seen them try to climb a small tree cause they see their bowl and wallet on a branch. See the typical fake acid story shit like a clown and elephants but for real ect.<br /><br />Long story short this is the only drug ive done that I actually saw stuff that wasn&#039;t there.<br /><br />Ive had typical acid trips though but nothing like a pink elephant fucking a dog shit.<br /><br />Mushrooms also are more geometrical and patterns and from what I hear people rarely have full hallucination. <br /><br />Unless you wanna go for a heroic dose then you might have some luck, but good luck.

				If you want what it&#039;s like on the movies, that&#039;d be delleriants.<br />DPH, Datura, DMH etc.<br /><br />These are dangerous and not healthy, do not try these.<br />These hallcinations are so real, you cant differentiate between reality/fake.<br /><br />

I saw the same woman I saw in one of my previous trips, she was disregarding me more or less last time but she seems to have warmed up to me and showed me all kinds of incredible things. She&#039;s quite a sight herself, looks like Olivia Wilde&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I wish I could share this with my family, I know they would be blown away if they would try it, but if I told them about it they would look at me like I&#039;m either going nuts or am in some kind of drug haze, would probably end up going to therapy.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I have only tried listening to music once and it was with way too small a dose, the music doesn&#039;t take you out of the experience?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve heard things about Datura, mostly terrible things. I have to admit the more trip reports I read the more I want to try it, but if there is one thing I learned in the past 2 months it&#039;s that I&#039;m definitely not immune to having scary experiences with psychedelics. I guess some things should stay a mystery

				If you want movie-like hallucinations, you want to take deliriants. DPH, datura stramonium, that sort of thing. You&#039;ll go completely mental for a few hours, hold conversations with people who aren&#039;t there and watch your walls turn into mountains of spiders.

				I&#039;ve had rocks and plants and things come to life on high doses of the 2C family, but you&#039;re always aware that you&#039;re tripping and can even turn it off temporarily if absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Never had stronger visual on anything over DMT though - that stuff is spiritual.&nbsp; :)

That&#039;s DPH all right.<br /><br />If you want actual hallucinations you need to do deliriants. If you want visions, you&#039;re looking at DMT or dissociatives (ketamine, DXM, PCP etc) or salvia. If you want visuals, you can kind of take anything you like to get a ++, and if you want a +++ just smoke some weed. Or take a heroic dose, but I wouldn&#039;t do that with the PEAs or most of the tryptamines...<br /><br />At least, this is in my experience. The most profound visions I ever had were from salvia, Jesus Christ that plant is a monster, if that helps - but I&#039;ve never had a deliriant experience so I can&#039;t speak about that.

				Datura is no joke. The dosage required for a full-on experience is pretty much near the lethal dosage, and potency varies considerably from seed to seed. Along with possible death, one could set himself/herself up for a delirious state of indefinite length. Simply put, it just has a bad track record. OP wants a hallucinatory experience, not one of delirium. Look into the 2C series, perhaps 2C-P, the NBOMe series, high dosages of LSD/mescaline, or DMT.
