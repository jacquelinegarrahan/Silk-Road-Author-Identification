				Hello everyone,<br /><br />This is for anyone who has purchased Hatters IV ready solution of BTH (Cold Shot). Unlike when I shoot #4, it goes nice and smooth, no problems. But it seems no matter the dose of Hatters cold shot, it STINGS LIKE HELL!!!! I&#039;ve tried lowering the amount of H liquid and filling the rest with water. Even went as low as 20 ml of liquid H and the rest water (80ml+ water) in attempt to dilute the H and hope that it didn&#039;t sting. But nothing has changed. <br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions on how to reduce the stinging from Hatters cold shot!?!?!? I like his business, he&#039;s very professional and fast when you need it right away, but the stinging really turns me away. I would much rather get a smooth shot that doesn&#039;t BURN like hell when I&#039;m pushing. I even tried to go slow, nope, but it made no difference.<br /><br />HELP!!! I REALLY want to enjoy Hatters cold shot but the burn makes me almost not want to do it at all..almost =P&nbsp; &nbsp;But it kind of kills the whole experience from the extreme burning.<br /><br />Any and ALL suggestions are GREATLY appreciated!!!!

				Hey atthepeak23,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have read somewhere else that someone was having the same problem, but I believe the solution came to be the person was inexperienced with IV or IM drugs. I will try to find the link to the other thread and update when I do.<br />How experienced are you? Does it burn right away? Or a little while after?<br /><br />I noticed you said when you shoot #4, it goes nice and smooth, with somewhat good #4, there will be little to no burn when you miss, the only way to check is to &quot;register&quot; again.(Based on my experience, could be wrong) So, I think you might be missing, just going on you are inexperienced with IV/IM. (You may very well be experienced)<br /><br />I have used vinegar to extract fentanyl before, and people say that it burns slighty going in. And it really doesn&#039;t burn too bad, so i&#039;m just trying to figure out why it would burn so badly? <br /><br />Let us know, so we can get some answers (Hopefully from Hatters) about the product. I even believe he has steps of his process of making his solution on his page. Will update with a link for that also.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your friendly addict,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dillybarz<br />

Ive been bangin oxys dillies 4 H for over 2 years now. I have the whole kit fresh needles a tournie iso alc 90% for sterile and all. Ive noticed in larger veins it doesnt sting as much as say a vein in the hand. I rotate every shot. Im very experienced and if unsure i register again to make sure im still in. It stings while pushing. Afterwards it itches in kind of a painful way when im done and take off the tie for about a minute then goes away. But i have heard bth needs an acidic additive to properly turn into ivable form thats why i tried extra water in attempt to equal the ph if that was the case but no difference. Just last longer cuz its more fluid now. So im not missing the shot and im goin slow to check for bubling of the skin ass most missed shots would do. But everythin is fine and dandy and i feel it rigght away as a successful shot would.<br /><br />Thank you for your feedback

				Hi,<br /><br />Sorry to hear that you are having this burning issue.&nbsp; But, I do check the PH of the solution for every batch.98% of the time it comes out as neutral.&nbsp; If you would like to try it yourself all you would have to do is purchase some PH paper and put a little drop of it and you will see if it changes color and if it does not you will know that it is a neutral solution. At times if/when the PH is off I do make adjustments so that the solution is PH neutral, but the blood in our body is slightly Basic and for whatever reason it seems that black tar will sting a little even if you are sure that you are in the vein properly, although it shouldn&#039;t be an extreme burn. <br /><br />The majority of the time when it really hurts is when the needle is not entirely in the vein or perhaps it may have poked through the vein and therefor it may appear that it is registered but it is actually because the vein is leaking due to it being punctured through.<br /><br />It is always good to do your research on SR Forums in the harm reduction section as well as research on proper needle usage on Google or any search engine.&nbsp; ( I am not saying that you are using the needle incorrectly) Although being aware and having good IV technique will always help any of us with keeping our veins as good and healthy as long as we can, due to their delicate nature.<br /><br />Also the difference between BTH, Dilaudid and Opana is that Dilaudid/Opana are manufactured by a standardized pharmaceutical company and they generally will insure that their are no impurities which is why our Opana extract is crystal clear and as well as Dilaudid (which I actually rarely get my hands on but when I do have a chance to extract, it is clear as well).&nbsp; These solutions do shoot very smoothly but even then it can sting a bit if it is not entirely in the vein or if the vein has been punctured through and has leakage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as I am sure you know all the impurities from the unregulated processing resulting in BTH has a significant difference in the end product.&nbsp; This is why I created the cold shoot in the first place first for myself as I realized how &quot;dirty&quot; BTH actually is (even in the best uncut, there is organic plant latex) where as when it is made with the &quot;afgan process&quot; there is a purification step to separate the morphine before it is diacyatelated making it a lighter color.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is why BTH is so dark, even if it is completely uncut and I filter it many times it still has some water soluble impurities but it certainly makes it a lot better before the filtering.<br /><br />It may also be that H has a tendency to sting when IV, especially in small veins.&nbsp; It is like this even with many pharmaceutical drugs which is why they will greatly dilute it in a slow drips with isotonic solutions, Phengram is a great example because if it is directly injected into a vein it will burn like hell and as it is caustic and will literately eat through your vein and skin causing necrosis.&nbsp; Although this is a worse case scenario I just wanted to give an analogy that there are many types of IV drugs that will/can burn.<br /><br />You don&#039;t really have to worry if it stings a little but do be careful if it hurts a lot or get a sharp pain as you may have hit a valve or nerve or worse an artery.&nbsp; If it really hurts, don&#039;t push as if it&#039;s not absorbed right away it can cause celulitis or abscesses (and trust me you don&#039;t want that) Another tip is to rotate sites and try to get larger veins as it shouldn&#039;t hurt so much when you use those. <br /><br />Sorry for the long reply but I just want to help in giving as much information as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regards

				Hello Hatter,<br /><br />Thank you for your reply and information.<br /><br />I have all the faith in the world that you filtered it to the point where it&#039;s the cleanest BTH can get, I in no way think this is your fault. I was more curious as others experience if I was the only one experiencing this and wondering if maybe I am having some kind of bad reaction to something the BTH was extracted with on this particular batch. I have ordered from you before and don&#039;t remember it burning, at least not like this time. And I rotate every shot, that&#039;s why I notice it burns more in small veins as I don&#039;t use the &quot;good&quot; veins twice in a row and move to what I can get. But I have been hospitalized a lot and have had many IV&#039;s in my arms and put on a LOT of steroids (the medical kind, not for body building) which shrink the veins making them harder to use and I have to take them every day (prednisone). A long with a lot of other medications that I have to take due to an unfortunate event in life that really set me back. It&#039;s what actually put me on to opiates to begin with, except the doctors don&#039;t want to help and give me the amount that I need. They loaded me with extreme amounts while in the hospital constantly and around the clock that my tolerance is through the roof, then when I get out they give me this bullshit low dose that doesn&#039;t even keep me out of withdraws. I can&#039;t afford the pills because theyre way too expensive so I moved to H, a much cheaper solution!<br /><br />But anyway, yea I practice very good technique and am very experienced with using needles and the proper form/use of them from being in the hospital and getting them done so often. Of course it&#039;s a little different, but it&#039;s the same more or less. and I&#039;m positive I&#039;m in the vein, completely and not hit and miss or in the valve or went thru. Though I&#039;m very valvular, the nurses often have trouble getting the line and keeping it. But I register frequently because I&#039;m aware of this. And it doesn&#039;t just seep in, it shoots right up the rig, strong source. Well, I guess this is just something I won&#039;t really be able to solve, but I was hoping to try and at least find some way to sooth the stinging/burning. It&#039;s just unfortunate at the moment!!<br /><br />Thank you for your response.<br /><br />If anyone else has experienced this with any kind of BTH IV and found a way around it or to sooth it please fill us in!<br /><br />atthepeak23

				First off, Hatter is the fuckin man! Delivered in 3 days, awesome stealth (though I don&#039;t see why someone would mail what it came in) and potent product. Not to mention the harm reduction that the cold shoot brings over normal tar. <br /><br />As for the burn, I don&#039;t know, that&#039;s really weird&nbsp; considering you have the technique down and that the solution is neutral apparently. Normal tar burns for me but I know that&#039;s due to the acidity. Like someone else said too, small veins tend to burn more (in my experience also) than the mainline. Maybe try pushing the plunger in really slowly?

				Thanks for feedback &amp; replying Hater! While I&#039;ve got you here Hatter, have you ever done any of your solution with H#4? Well, In your case, you would probably start with H#3 for price, and do your thing from there. Was just curious, and possibly sparked a wire for a soon to come product ;)
