				this get ask every few week so making a post about all the test do you can do at home to see how good it is.<br /><br />FEEL TEST-The simplest is the feel test. In this test all you need are clean, dry hands. Take your index finger and press it into a small pile of chopped or screened cocaine hydrochloride. Then take what adheres to your finger (1/4 of a line is sufficient) and press it against your thumb pad. After a second or two gently rub thumb and forefinger in a circular motion. The coke should melt and feel very slick and oily, about the feel of fine machine oil. Any sticky or gritty feeling is a sign of adulterants. It&#039;s amazing how often this simple test will show its value.<br /><br />TASTE TEST-Warning:because there may be undesirable adulterants in your sample, use caution. Take a little cocaine on your finger and put it on the tip of your tongue. The taste should be bitter, but not terribly so, and there should not be an immediate or quick freeze (numbing). Rather, it should take a couple of minutes before you feel the anesthetic effect. The numb should not seem super intense, yet it should be definite, with an almost &quot;chill effect. If it&#039;s metallic or bites severely, it&#039;s probably cut with a synthetic caine and is to be avoided. Pure cocaine has a more organic taste; it&#039;s somewhat bitter but not sharp to the tongue.<br /><br />TINFOIL TEST-Cocaine will, upon being heated to its vapor point, completely evaporate, leaving a stain where it had been, but no residue. However, there are several other substances commonly used as adulterants which will do likewise. Therefore, lack of residue is not proof of purity, but residue is an almost certain proof of adulteration.<br /><br />Take a strip (about 2&quot; by 6&quot;) of clean, unwrinkled tinfoil (I prefer heavy gauge) and curve it lengthwise into a smooth, elongated valley. Take a small (5mg or1/4 of a line) sample of the toot in question and drop it on the foil about an inch and a half from one end, in the center of the valley. Holding the other end of the foil, heat the sample from underneath carefully with a match or flame. Keep the flame, yet close enough for the heat to be sufficient to vaporize the sample. When the sample has been heated to the point where no more smoke or reaction is evident, remove the heat source and allow a moment for the foil to cool. Placing the foil on a smooth, flat surface, take your index finger and and firmly press and pull it across the burned spot where the sample evaporated. There should be no residue visible upon your finger. There should be a stain of amber to dark brown color visible on the foil.<br /><br />The appearance of any residue is an almost certain indication of adulteration.<br /><br />WATER TEST-Drop a small, finely-screened amount of cocaine (at least 1/2 a line) in a clean, clear, tall glass of plain water. Clean coke is highly soluble in water. Upon hitting the surface, it will dissolve with almost explosive speed, leaving transparent trailers as the particles descend (the only adulterant to impart similar trails being procaine hydrochloride).<br /><br />CHLORINE TEST-The best simple test for discerning the presence of synthetic caine drugs (anesthetic adulterants) in your cocaine is the chlorine test. Virtually all of the synthetic cuts react positively to the bleach test and reliably produce an orange-red or dull brick-red residue on the surface of the bleach. Since the synthetic caines are not removed by the base process, they are of prime concern.<br /><br />To perform the test, use a freshly opened (unoxidized) bottle of chlorine bleach (Clorox, Purex, etc). Fill a clear, tall (8oz to12oz) glass with the chlorine solution. Run a small line (10mg) of the sample through a fine screen, or chop diligently with a razor blade. Care must be taken not to contaminate the sample with any precious cocaine (etc) residues. Even minute amounts of contaminants could affect the test results. Gently drop the pulverized sample into the center of the bleach solution.<br /><br />The sample should hesitate on the surface 5-15 seconds before starting its milky descent. Spiraling downward, the particles should dissolve on or before reaching the bottom. Particles which break out of formation or fall with no trail are usually sugars (mannite, sucrose, lactose, etc). These pose no threat as they are removed in processing.<br /><br />While illicit (mixed alkaloidal) cocaine will leave an oily spot, this oil slick could vary from almost colorless to faint amber. It will never be red without the presence of one or more of the synthetic caines. Pharmaceutical cocaine will leave no trace on the surface of the bleach.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE-There is a common street myth which relates a fizzing and spurting on the surface of the bleach solution to quinine sulfate. It is more probably an indication of the presence of lidocaine free-base occasionally used to cut cocaine hydrochloride.<br /><br />METHANOL TEST-The best simple test to determine the presence of sugar adulterants in the cocaine hydrochloride sample is the methanol test.<br /><br />In this test all you need are: a bottle of absolute methanol (methyl alcohol 100%, an unscratched stainless steel, or better yet, a dark teflon-coated tablespoon, and the cocaine test sample. Bend or place the spoon so that the bowl is level and fill at least 3/4 full with methanol. Drop a finely chopped sample of cocaine (one line, approximately 20mg) into the center of the spoon and observe. The cocaine (as well as the synthetic caines) will dissolve completely within seconds.High quality illicit coke and pharmaceutical coke will disappear within five seconds; poorly processed or adulterated products will take longer. No sugars will dissolve in methanol, therefore they will remain in the spoon for viewing. This test will show you the amount of sugar adulterant/cut (i,e,, sucrose, dextrose, lactose, fructose, inositol) in the sample. Since these sugar adulterants are removed in the free-base process, they are primarily of concern only if their proportion makes the purchase price of the coke unwarranted, for example: if the cocaine, upon testing, is shown to be 50% sugar, without a comparable reduction in purchase price.<br /><br /><br />METHANOL REMOVAL OF INERT ADULTERANTS-Dissolve the cocaine sample in a vial or test tube containing 10 ml (per gram of toot) absolute methanol (100%). Pour the resulting suspension through a filter paper. After paper has drained, place an additional 5 to 10 ml of methanol in the vial. Shake to rinse, and pour through the filter. The sugar adulterant will remain in the filter paper and may be discarded (or retained for your purpose, if any). The methanol solution may now be evaporated, leaving the unsweetened toot. Note: The possible presence of other adulterants may retard or prevent satisfactory end results. For practical reasons it is best to try this with a small amount of material first.<br /><br />MELTPOINT TEST- The test most often used by dealers to indicate cocaine&#039;s purity prior to purchase is the melt point test. This common laboratory technique calls for the gradual heating of the test material on a &quot;hot stage,&quot; an electrically heated and controlled platform. The operator of the melting device watches the material closely. The temperature of the hot stage platform is raised at a constant rate until the substance starts to melt. The temperature at which the melting action begins and ends is carefully noted. Since each different chemical substance is known to have a specific temperature at which it will change to the liquid state, a fairly accurate idea of the degree of purity can be obtained from the test results. A high degree of purity is indicated not only by the specific temperature of the melting action, but by the spread or number of degrees between the start and finish of the action. Free-base cocaine, if pure, will melt at 98 c* with a maximum speed of only one degree. The spread of pure cocaine hydrochloride may be 5 degrees or more, and range (depending on processing and origin) from 188-197 c*. The melting point of free-base offers a more definite and reliable test of purity, especially when used in conjunction with the &quot;weight return&quot; test, next explained.

				Nice post, +1.&nbsp; Unfortunately no easy test for levamisole.&nbsp; I&#039;d happily pay money for a quality testing kit that tested for all this shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pro tip: if you&#039;re going to do the flame vapor test, do it outside or someplace very well ventilated, because certain adulterants will smoke up and stink real badly.<br /><br />

				great post +1<br /><br />An other question I have is can I take the 99.5% ACETONE to wash my blow or should I first put some baked epsom salt in it?<br />thx<br /><br />take care<br />12345
