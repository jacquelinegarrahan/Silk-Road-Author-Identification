				I&#039;ve never had a good time smoking weed, its always given me fast heart rate/paranoia/overstimulation etc. and its just all around unenjoyable, the only positive I would get is increased creativity.<br /><br />Now this was smoking local bud and who knows what strain it really was, so I was wondering if anyone else gets effects like me and has tried Indica? I would like to be able to enjoy a nice chill high.

				I wouldn&#039;t say that necessarily, indica dominant strains generally provide a bit more of a body high/buzz than sativa and also tend to make you more sleepy/dreamy than sativa which I consider to me more of an energetic head high. Sativa is good for daytime smoking and indica is better at night.

				If smoking weed is giving you a noticeably faster heart rate you are probably over-doing it. Try taking smaller puffs. Maybe even a half puff then wait a few minutes. You can always toke more but you can never toke less :)<br /><br />If you have a low tolerance to cannabis, taking massive bong rips/vap hits will probably never be &quot;chill&quot; regardless of the strain.

				There are differences in CBD/THC ratios between different strains for sure, and relatively high CBD can make you more stoned then high. This doesn&#039;t rely on the sativa/indica mix per se, but it&#039;s information that should be available from any good vendor. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a big cannabis user myself - i find the results to depend too much on the mood i&#039;m in when smoking any. Surely i can enjoy a smoke when chilling at a bbq/campfire etc with little on my mind, but at stressful times i usually doesn&#039;t make things better at all. <br /><br />It&#039;s not that cannabis will usually make you paranoid, anxious or nervous, but it can make situations already present worse in some cases. This can ofter explain why one person has a very good experience and another a bad one when smoking the exact same pot and in equal amounts.

				try to find stains with a high CBD ratio instead of THC. CBD will get you relaxed and unable to go anywhere =)<br />Also CDB has a lot more medical potential than THC. But it really depends upon the strain and user. <br />Some people feel good with the light body heavy head stone. Others become paranoid with the head stone and prefer body stone.<br />Try some indicas or some 50/50 mix mate!

				I do prefer strains with a good amount of indica in them, something like white widow, over stronger sativa strains like ak47. To me its more the mood i&#039;m in that determines the outcome that the strain of pot though. This isn&#039;t a bad thing though, when i&#039;m a bit on edge i simply don&#039;t smoke any ;)

Have half as much then wait a few minutes. If you are sitting back, try to stand up and see if you can before having more.<br /><br />I seem to find indica a little bit stressful sometimes. Maybe because I am so used to sativa though and being couchlocked can feel a bit strange, especially if you try to resist it. Either way though, start with a small amount and see how you go.

Everything is mixed up. I only know of 4 seedbanks that keep their shit legit. That´s why names are so irrelevant now. You can get 10 seeds of white widow from 10 different vendors and you will see the differences. So some may say white widows is good and others white widow is shit. But names from pure genetics are not irrelevant.&nbsp; You should look from where the strain comes from and not it&#039;s name.

				If your a long-time smoker, then how can you not tell the difference between indica and sativa? It&#039;s not like comparing different wines. It&#039;s like comparing different kinds of alcohol..<br /><br />I personally just don&#039;t get that high with sativas. The mental effects I used to get are long-gone. Sativas just leave me feeling anxious for no reason while making my body feel less stoned than desired. I smoke weed to relieve stress, relieve pain, feel sleepy - indicas do all this much better than any sativa.&nbsp; Sativas are definitely better for some people - it&#039;s just not for me.

I&#039;ve been smoking heavily, and selling, off and on for 10+ years. I&#039;ve smoked it all and ate a bunch of it, grew myself, had friends grow (and get busted), hash, wax, $50/g wax from an Oakland dispensary and top shelf nugs both pure sativa, pure indica and everything in between.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always preached the differences between the 2, sort of praising one strain over another and even had girls that bought from me that would refer to them asking if I had workout weed (sativa) or movie weed (indica) since it was easier for them to remember.<br /><br />But with all that said, it&#039;s each crop that makes more of a difference than the strain. I&#039;ve seen the same strain look, smoke and taste completely different from one crop to another. There are way more important factors than the strain, the strain is just the potential.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten weed from 3 different vendors in the past 2 weeks from SR that people here claimed was &#039;dank&#039;, &#039;top notch&#039; nugs and they were in fact average nugs that were either not cured long enough, not trimmed properly, and they all had that &#039;regs&#039; type of smell rather than the rich distinctive aroma I&#039;m used to in top shelf buds.<br /><br />None of the named strains from vendors I&#039;ve gotten from SR are even close to the no named nugs that are being sold locally. It&#039;s pretty shitty when I sell the weed I bought from SR and then buy a bag locally for personal use.

It is the exact same alcohol, but i suspect the latter category resulted in worse hangovers. This is probably due to the total amount (and rate at which it was) consumed, but still its hard to compare one to the other. <br /><br />With cannabis the difference is larger though. Surely THC = THC, but pot contains other psychoactive substances as well, at variable ratios, so you cannot simply state that the effect of one batch of cannabis must be equal to that of another as long as the thc concentration is equal. All cannabis is a mixture of various substances, with&nbsp; more than one being active, so you need to assure they are all present in equal amounts to state that pot = pot.

				i recently watched a show on TV called &quot;Head Games&quot; where they took a box of wine and filled two bottles with the same boxed wine.&nbsp; The only difference is that they slapped a fancy label on one bottle and a janky looking label on the other bottle, and 100% of the people in the taste test said the one with the fancy label tasted the best..... but they were both the same wine.

				Which proves what exactly? The perception of quality may be subjective surely.<br /><br />But what if they drank equal amounts of the fancy and cheaply labeled wines and then took a breathalizer or drving test? Would that result in the cheaply labeled wine to cause people to appear less (or more?) drunk according to objective criteria?<br /><br />You cannot really compare wine (or other alcoholic drinks) to cannabis that directly though. Drink has only one single psychoactive compound, whereas cannabis has several in ratios that vary between strains, harvests etc. <br /><br />As far as boxed wines go: the bag-in-box packaging system is probably superior to bottling in tinted glass - it mostly depends on what they put into the package. The idea that a wine must be expensive to taste well is a complete fallacy and falls though on most blind tests, regardless if it came out of a box or a bottle.

				Weed is like human genetics. There is a wide variety of expressions of a gene but the end product is the manifestation of specific traits. You have specific characteristics within the sativa and indica groups, then you have the mixtures in the hybrids. Hardcore MJ geneticists go to great lengths to harness those expressions. HIGH fives to them ;). Depending on the type of high I&#039;m looking for helps me to decide what I want to buy. The effects of MJ vary with the individual too.

People get quite pretentious about the whole thing.

I think your own mood, your own personal biochemistry has as much of a&nbsp; impact as the the strain does.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You know, I somewhat agree with you. I&#039;ve been smoking heavily, and selling, off and on for 10+ years. I&#039;ve smoked it all and ate a bunch of it, grew myself, had friends grow (and get busted), hash, wax, $50/g wax from an Oakland dispensary and top shelf nugs both pure sativa, pure indica and everything in between.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always preached the differences between the 2, sort of praising one strain over another and even had girls that bought from me that would refer to them asking if I had workout weed (sativa) or movie weed (indica) since it was easier for them to remember.<br /><br />But with all that said, it&#039;s each crop that makes more of a difference than the strain. I&#039;ve seen the same strain look, smoke and taste completely different from one crop to another. There are way more important factors than the strain, the strain is just the potential.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten weed from 3 different vendors in the past 2 weeks from SR that people here claimed was &#039;dank&#039;, &#039;top notch&#039; nugs and they were in fact average nugs that were either not cured long enough, not trimmed properly, and they all had that &#039;regs&#039; type of smell rather than the rich distinctive aroma I&#039;m used to in top shelf buds.<br /><br />None of the named strains from vendors I&#039;ve gotten from SR are even close to the no named nugs that are being sold locally. It&#039;s pretty shitty when I sell the weed I bought from SR and then buy a bag locally for personal use.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree, you can grow two of the same seeds and wind up with two distinct plants that have differing effects. The time of harvest has a lot to do with the whole mind vs body thing; early harvests, especially with sativas, usually produce more psychoactive, trippy, racy highs. Late harvests produce more sedating, narcotic, couch lock-type stones, especially with indica strains (although going too long wll ruin most indicas completely).<br /><br />There absolutely is a difference between different strains though. I like sativas for the day and indicas at night. Smoking too much kush or similar strains during the day makes me want to sleep, whereas sour diesel, haze, etc makes me want to do shit. No way in hell this is placebo or dependent on mood.

				Agreed. One definitely shouldn&#039;t harvest way off peak in order to try changing one species of cannabis into the other. Many sativa strains needs to be flowered for exceptionally long in order to get the biggest yield and most balanced high, but wait any longer and the potency begins to drop off quick. Trying to harvest indicas early is also a bad idea, as it results in that burned out, confused &quot;premo weed&quot; feeling you mentioned. Wait too long and most indicas will fail to give much of a &quot;head change&quot; at all. This may be good for patients seeking the purported healing properties of CBD/CBNs, but it sucks for those of us that want to get high at the same time :)

				Theres not a ton of difference between the strains that I notice, Indica is more of a body high, makes you more tired. Sativa is more of a mind high and youre usually more awake.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some people just arent made for weed though, it just might not be the right thing for you. Like for me, I get extremely paranoid when I&#039;m high. When the high first starts I&#039;m always paranoid, but I&#039;ve learned to calm myself down just by realizing its alright and everything is chill and theres nothing to worry about. its easier for me to smoke alone, I find myself getting more paranoid when i smoke with other people, unless I really trust them. <br /><br />You can try not smoking too much bud at a time, and in a situation where you can feel safer maybe. and find someone who will sell you good quality stuff, if theres other shit mixed in or anything, and youre not able to handle that kinda stuff, it couldd be one bad trip.

K+ to you for that answer! <br />deffo..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Strain&nbsp; (more indica or more staiva) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Genetics (is it coming from a well known clone with stable characteristics or is it grown from 20 batch seeds? some people assume if they buy for example PPP seeds they will get the same PPP has everyone else. This is completely not true. If you are looking for example for the same Jack Herer that a dutch coffeeshop has, you should grow like 50 seeds and look for the right phenotype)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+Growing experience.Give a elite clone to a noob and to an experienced grower. I&#039;m 100% positive that the same genetic will give different kinds of weed. Whether the plants suffered a lot of stress, growing medium, nutrient uptake rate, light per square foot, co2, etc...) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+Harvest time will have a major impact in CBD and THC levels. Harvest too soon and u get high THC less CBD (more cerebral) Harvest late and u get more CBD and less THC (narcotic body stone) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+at last but not the least .... how you handle your bud. How you dry it, how you cure it how you store it. That will have 30% or more impact in flavor, potency, etc.. Most growers tend to think that the work is over when you send them trees down which is absolutely false. <br /><br />In general terms it&#039;s more or less about this. Off course there are very important factors not described but they are more growing setup related.<br /><br />And I&#039;m 100% positive indica and sativas are very very different. If you don&#039;t believe grow a pure indica and a pure sativa yourself. Look for the right pheno in each one. In the end you will look at day/ night results.<br /><br />Waka
