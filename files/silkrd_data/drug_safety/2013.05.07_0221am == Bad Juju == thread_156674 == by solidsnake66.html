				Today when I was about to take some MDMA I got from supertrips I got an extremely overwhelming feeling that it was a bad idea.<br /><br />This is how it went down. When I got out of work I got my stuff out sat in front of the tv and took some magnesium to combat the bruxism. But when I went to take the MDMA it was like my entire being just said stop, don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />My last experience not being a great one (I threw up and the trip was super intense yet only lasted a couple hours), I sat debating whether or not it was just the fact that last time was shitty causing the feeling but decided against it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tripped a lot on acid, shrooms, and a few times on 25i and 25c-NBOME, I smoke weed all the time, and have had MDMA on 5 occasions now. It&#039;s been about 3 weeks since I tripped last and over a month since I last used MDMA. I&#039;ve been anxious before, but I&#039;ve never had a feeling so strong that it stopped me from taking a drug before. I was even looking forward to it all day! <br /><br />I feel completely normal, other than a little tired mentally from a long busy day at work. Physically I feel fine.<br /><br />Does anyone else ever get this? Now that it&#039;s getting later I kinda feel like I should have said fuck it and just taken it, but when I get such a strong feeling like that it really makes me stop and think.<br /><br /><br />If this doesn&#039;t belong in the Drug Safety thread my apologies, but I didn&#039;t know where else to put it.

				Yeah, if you&#039;re body says no, listen to it.<br /><br />I have had experiences like you describe. I try to always go with my gut feeling. Obviously you will never know if it was a good idea to abstain or not but better to trust your guts. You can always roll another night&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t. Maybe it&#039;s just coincidence, but the last two days have been the most stressful days I&#039;ve had at work in a long time. I don&#039;t think I would have been able to cope with clients screaming in my ear the day after rolling.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad I did trust my gut!
