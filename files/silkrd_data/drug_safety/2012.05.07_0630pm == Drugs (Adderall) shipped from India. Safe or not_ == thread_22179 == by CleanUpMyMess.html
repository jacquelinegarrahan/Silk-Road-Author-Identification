				I&#039;ve read a lot of articles about drug counterfeit in India, and I&#039;m still capable to cancel my order at this time. Should I cancel?<br />I don&#039;t want to take drugs that are harmful for me, without giving me the desired effect.<br /><br />Seller is googleyed, but since he does not come in contact with the drugs, I doubt if he can vouch for the quality of the Adderall (if it even is adderall...).<br /><br />So, what would you do?<br /><br />Cheers!

				Googleyed had a pretty good reputation last time I checked, but I wouldn&#039;t know personally. India is a big source for lots of drugs, both legitimate and counterfeit, but it&#039;s hard to determine which would be which.<br /><br />While it&#039;s highly unlikely they would purposely sell you something that would damage your health, Indian pharmacies might do it to save money, or even more likely, just send you inactive ingredients. But Googleyed trusts those people; if they sent out bunk products, he would find a different source.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend you make your decision based on how much it costs, though. If it&#039;s not too expensive, it might be worth the risk to investigate them. But, be careful when you get them.

And I don&#039;t want my cancellation to be a trouble for him, as I might still decide to reorder the item...

				Price sounds too good to be true, I&#039;ve been thinking about it for a while but my last Indian order ended up in NY&nbsp; and I&#039;m from Australia so I&#039;m too keen to order from India again, plus the custom&#039;s seizure rate seems pretty high when ordering from India.
