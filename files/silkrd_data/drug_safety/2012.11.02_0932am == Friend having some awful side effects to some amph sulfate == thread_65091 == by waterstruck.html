				last night my friend asked if she could try some of my amph as we sat with a bottle of wine.<br /><br />I put a very small pinch into her wine and a large pinch for me, my normal. She had that and said she felt awake and no huge rush. After about an hour I gave her another small pinch into her wine. I don&#039;t know the weight but it was basically a few granules, small. This is quality stuff and you feel even a tiny pinch but not to any great degree.<br /><br />All good for 4-5 hours of us chatting awake bright and happy. Then she got up and falls over with severe vertigo (very dizzy and can&#039;t co-ordinate movements). She also feels nausea.<br /><br />She is now lying still and she&#039;s fine, but when she moves she feels awful and can barely walk. She has no other symptoms at all (heart is normal, no chest pains etc).<br /><br />What went wrong here?<br /><br />I have been taking this stuff for a long time and I have never once had an adverse effect from it.<br /><br />Was it the mixing with wine (I have always done this but maybe it affects some people?). We only had a bottle of wine between us over hours, small amount for us compared to normal.<br /><br />I have since found out she is on a mild-antidepressant but I&#039;ve done some reading and that doesn&#039;t seem to interfere with amph.<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling extremely guilty about this as I have basically harmed her.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming this will decrease as the drug wears off over the course of the day?<br /><br />Please feel free to tell me I&#039;m an idiot for anything above! I&#039;m a fairly seasoned user and have never once had an issue with this drug.<br /><br />Any advice appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks

				ideas: one or other of: she is dehydrated, she has underlying orthostatic issues (low bp = vertigo, dizzy spells) and the speed makes this worse, she struck a side effect 5% of Aderall patients report (dizziness).<br />If you don&#039;t go to ER she should keep her head below her knees or lie on an angle, or just lookup vertigo/dizzy on the spot remedies yourself. Plus drinki some water! speed dehydrates the blood very quickly, alcohol as well. The nausea is just what you get with vertigo.

				Thanks for that. We can rule out dehydration as we were drinking water and green tea all night along with our wine. She has also been sipping water all morning.<br /><br />She feels totally fine when she&#039;s lying flat, as soon as she starts to get up slowly she gets a sick feeling and very dizzy. She doesn&#039;t want to go to ER, she is lying on her side trying to fall asleep to sleep it off.<br /><br />I found an Aderall leaflet that says dizzyness can be common when first taking the drug, especially when combined with alcohol. I&#039;m wondering if she is just in that 5%. The amount she had was just so tiny it&#039;s difficult to believe these effects

				never heard of amphetamine causing any symptoms similar to that<br /><br />i have heard of alcohol frequently causing similar problems... potentially the amp interacted with the alcohol or A-D combo. sounds like your friend got especially drunk and is now hung over or something to me <br /><br />mixing drugs is a bad idea unless you are familiar with the effects of each individual drug. theres no way to tell what happened unless she has taken amphetamine alone before

				I take D-amphetamine sulphate daily and often get this.<br />On several occasions I&#039;ve passed out 5-10 seconds after standing up from a prone position.&nbsp; I believe its due to low BP, in my case, I have an extremely low BMI and I very rarely do physical exercise.<br />Given that she has also drunk alcohol, I get the feeling that this is very likely to be the cause.&nbsp; I usually just lie back down and work on tensing each muscle group to promote bloodflow, then try to stand after 1-2 minutes of doing this.<br />DONT take any other drugs to attempt to fix the problem.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what else she is on, but it&#039;d be a nightmare to figure out the interactions between that, the alcohol, the amphetamines, and whatever anyone suggests she takes to alleviate the problem.<br /><br />

				there is actually a drug interaction (i did some research) between ethanol and amphetamine where the amp actually potentiates the effects of the alcohol. <br /><br />one of the main effects is increasing the cardiovascular issues including increasing heart rate while subsequently thinning the blood causing increased strain<br /><br />also leads to greater dehydration which it really sounds like your friend is suffering from in addition to hypotension as mentioned<br /><br />many people report this issue of feeling less drunk than usual because of the amp but then quickly getting very sick with dizziness and nausea then horrible hang over symptoms exactly as you describe <br /><br />best thing to do is rest and consume fluids/electrolytes as possible just let both drugs get out of your system

				It sounds like you are being pretty level headed about it, that&#039;s probably the most important thing in these sort of situations.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t agree with the hype surrounding amphetamines + dehydration.&nbsp; Humans can survive more than a week without water, and I know from personal experience that even though I am quite unhealthy, I can still go more than 24 hours whilst taking amphetamines before dehydration becomes a major issue.&nbsp; That being said, I don&#039;t drink alcohol, which would almost certainly add to the negative effects of amphetamine based dehydration(duh)

				We&#039;ve booked an emergency appointment with a doctor in 2 hours as it has just got no better.<br /><br />There&#039;s no way she is dehydrated now, she has been steadily sipping water all day. Low bp sounds likely I guess

				Please let us know how you and your friend gets on, has the meds effected her BP and alcohol could have lowered her BP even more&nbsp; and mixing it with the amph could have caused her to feel dizzy , I have heard of this happening before ...Has she got a previous history of vertigo ?? Looked online could not see anything on any other forum

				If she tries to stand, make sure she&#039;s tensing her neck and chest.&nbsp; Keep the blood from rushing out of her head, thats whats responsible for the vertigo(imo)<br /><br />Do you mind letting us know how it goes? Especially how the doctor describes what is happening.&nbsp; Given the similarities in our physiological makeup, I&#039;d love to get more info on specifically whats happening from a professional medical background.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have to base all of my claims on research and abstractions.

				I&#039;ve seen some super bad reactions when combining amph with antihistamines like Claritin or Benadryl. Nausea, dizziness, and general bad-times.

				<br />Her BP was normal but her heart rate was still quite a bit elevated. Amazing considering it has been 20 hours since and she had taken so little.<br /><br />The doc said her size and the fact she&#039;s female would make the drug significantly more effective. She said the amount was basically too much for her. She agreed the amount of alcohol was not significant and that dehydration was unlikely given all the other fluids we were drinking. She check the AD and there was no issues with the combination.<br /><br />I explained how small an amount of drug was consumed and she replied that it must have been extremely good quality&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />She asked us to monitor the heart rate from time to time and if it increases at any point tonight, to go to ER.<br /><br />My friend has now been asleep for 10 hours and counting.<br /><br />Sorry the above doesn&#039;t provide more detail, but we&#039;d only get that if we went to ER. This was a local doctor.<br /><br />I&#039;m never going to let anyone try anything again unless they have done it before! I have never felt so guilty in my life.<br /><br />Appreciate the responses

				As a general rule you shuold always be taste testing something first to check for allergies.&nbsp; Just a dab of powder on the inside of the cheek and a 10 minute wait will suffice.<br /><br />Also, its very possible your friend is merely hypersensitive to amphetamines.&nbsp; I know I get a much bigger kick out of 20mg of dexamphetamine than some of my friends get out of 50-60mg of meth.

				I get minor headaches occasionally, I&#039;ve found taking a choline supplement is the best cure for this.&nbsp; I&#039;m not great with neurology so I don&#039;t know the mechanics of it but since I started taking centrophenoxine, the headaches have completely ceased.

				Thanks for the link. I actually have some valium that I&#039;m sure would have helped but I just really didn&#039;t want to make the situation worse.<br /><br />Just in case anyone else reads this re. hypersensitive:<br /><br />We did some really good quality coke one night and after a few lines I was high as a kite and she just felt a nice rush then fell asleep a couple of hours later. I was buzzing all night on the same amount. She also has a very high tolerance to caffeine.<br /><br />So this was specific to amph.<br /><br />Good advice re taste test. Although in this situation it was 4 hours until the bad effects started, after the drug had peaked.

				wow 4 hrs to get the bad reaction, would be worth having a look at the 1/2 life of the other medication she was taking , this might help to determine why it took 4 hrs , what was taken first the amph or the medication

				The doctor said that it is common for vertigo to start after the drug peaks, especially when mixed with alcohol. I also saw this on one of the sites I read which was a pdf of an aderall pamphlet.<br /><br />Btw although a lot better, she still feels weak and still has had the occasional lightheaded feeling. This is after 2 good nights sleep.

				Aha so the peak is the 1/2 life of the drug , that&#039;s why is so important for people to know the 1/2 life of substances reduces the risk of O/D and adverse effects . I do hope your friend feels better soon
