				To preface this, I&#039;ve seen studies where meth addicts&#039; brains release dopamine at the mere mention of the drug itself.<br /><br />Due to being a nerdy/faggoty mofo, I usually can&#039;t stand more than thirty minutes on the treadmill, or exercise in general.<br /><br />Well, I snorted 20mg of MrImporter&#039;s Speed Paste (Amphetamine Sulfate) and ran for 2 hours, 20 minutes. Went through 4 big bottles of water as well.<br /><br />I was wondering, if I continue this- do you think my brain will develop positive associations with exercise? I can&#039;t use amphetamine every time I workout, so it&#039;d be nice if my brain started associating cardio with feeling good. I know that dopamine (what amphetamine acts on) is considered by most the &#039;reward pathway&#039;- the neurotransmitter that rewards you for doing things right.<br /><br />So, do you think if I repeatedly take amphetamine while exercising that eventually I&#039;ll start getting a placebo effect through exercise alone? Thanks for your input!

				That&#039;s actually a pretty good idea, but you&#039;d need to always be on speed when you exercise and always exercise when you&#039;re on speed for a while. Then maybe you&#039;ll start associating exercising with amphetamine, but that could also mean that your dopamine levels would lower in anticipation to the dopamine release caused by the amphetamine. I don&#039;t think exercising on speed is very good for your heart though..

				IMO, it&#039;s a bad idea. <br /><br />From my experience, the more you work out, the better you feel. Get motivated and make the gym your 2nd home ;)

				Well I think it could work, zvp&#039;s arguments are good. I would just be careful with your heart and eat enough, maybe bananas for the potassium. You should try it out for a week or so and tell us how it goes! If he&#039;s not motivated enough to go to the gym, associating speed with the gym may be a good idea to make him start exercising, but well.. it won&#039;t necessarily work.

				Firstly constant use exercise is bound to put unnecessary stress on your heart, get a HR monitor and test out your max HR with and without speed. Potentially you could be taking some years off your life or force yourself into an early cardiac arrest.<br /><br />Secondly I have tried this with dexedrine, I&#039;ve run 13 miles on a dexie in my best ever time and it is an amazing way to chemically motivate yourself, but a few days later when you try to do it without it you realise how knackered you are and suffer extreme demotivation and tiredness.<br /><br />I dont think it is a long term solution.

				Using amphetamine or any serious stimulant on a regular basis during exercise is so bad I would not recomend it. Rise in BP during exercise over prolonged period will cause your left ventricle to grow abnormally and if not controlled will lead to a weakened heart/possible heart failure.<br /><br />Possible anuerysm and stroke during the exercise to and amphetamines are really catabolic so muscle wastage and strength loss will be an issue. Use for weightloss short term if you want when you are NOT exercising or at least use a real low dose when exercising.

Obviously you shouldn&#039;t take a high dose, but 20mg of speed of a purity of 50% isn&#039;t that high, even if it were extremely pure it&#039;d be an okay dose I think.<br />You&#039;re right saying that exercising on it isn&#039;t so great but his plan of associating speed with exercise is interesting and may be worth the try.

				Interesting experiment. Keep us informed if you do plan on doing it. One thing I&#039;m not sure is if taking beta blockers or calcium channel blockers will help reduce your BP while giving you the same motivation. It will make you feel a bit more tired but oddly it makes it easier to exercise for longer. Good luck.

				Considering that you can&#039;t even run for more than 30 mins without amphetamines, two hours and 20 mins is a bad fucking idea. I would only use drugs when first starting out, and then tapering off when you&#039;ve built up some endurance; as others have said you may end up fucking yourself up in the long term.

				I&#039;;d say no. Don&#039;t use speed as part of any plan to exercise.<br /><br />Others have eloquated very well on the fors and against, I&#039;ll just say that as someone who does exercise a lot, 30 mins a day is a good start. You can add on 5 mins each day and soon get into a routine.<br /><br />I like to work out then use cannabis as a relaxant. This helps ease my muscles and sets me up for more exercise. I used to stop mdway jogging for a shared joint but no longer do that.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Sex is a good work out also!<br /><br />Maybe you should try and meet someone - jog on over to see them and maybe get it on. <br /><br />Oh, I do a LOT of walking, mainly in work but I love to walk all day if I can and consider than my mainstay of keeping fit.<br /><br />Only drug I like for that is a nice joint for the end of the walk!<br /><br />Speed. is great for helping you get more motivated, but the trouble is that motivation itself might only be there when you have speed. It is a very addictive drug, only one I was ever addicted to in the sense that it was a stimulant I used daily for a period of months. Coming off it was hard but anyone who uses speed daily will confirm that.<br /><br />Exercise is best when drug free. There are too many drugs for people who exercise and I&#039;ve seen people start off on speed and end up on steroids, Human growth hormone and other dodgy things to put into your body.<br /><br />Drugs ought to be recreational, using for exercise, in my view, is a bad idea always.<br /><br />That said, half the Olympic gold medalists might disagree. There ARE performance enhancing drugs thst work, speed was banned long ago because anyone using it has an advantage over others not using in a variety of sports.<br /><br />The long term effects of the newer stimulants (RCs) has yet to be determined. I don&#039;t fancy being a test dummy for them and stick to tried and tested drugs.<br /><br />

				***********<br />BAD IDEA.<br />***********<br /><br />So for about two-three weeks, I&#039;d been trying exercise on 20mg insufflated amphetamine sulfate. I&#039;d give myself at least one day between workouts, preferably two.<br /><br />Well, the day after my last workout with my amphetamine- I was gaming online. Nothing seizure inducing; I was playing a good bout of Cards Against Humanity online with some friends and having a great time. Felt great, nothing was keeping me down.<br /><br />Next thing I know, I&#039;m completely dazed, surrounded by multiple ambulance workers and being convinced to be carted off to the hospital.<br /><br />From what my flatmates told me, they hard a loud crash (my desk chair) followed by an even bigger crash (my body to the floor).<br /><br />Multiple CAT scans including ones with contrast fluids show a perfectly healthy brain... and in the hospital my heart rate seemed normal. It&#039;s perfectly possible that this episode was completely unrelated to my amphetamine sulfate + exercise routine- but it&#039;s scared me to the point that I won&#039;t continue it any further. Thankfully the main scar from multiple cuts on my face will likely be hidden by my eyebrow.<br /><br />Use extreme caution with substances, everybody- I thought I was being responsible with low doses and spacing out between doses, but this was definitely a wake-up call for me!

				I can attest to this long term business. I work really labor intensive job landscaping, Lifting , walking and sweating all day. I would take add med dexmethylphenidate every morning for about 6 months. I lost about 25 pounds, pants were falling off. I had to make new holes in all my belts.&nbsp; I have not experience any use of speed before.&nbsp; I found out that if I exercised in the morning then I would take the med after and I would have energy for the rest of the day.&nbsp; This made working out not so bad.&nbsp;

				I can tell you from personal experience, the amph will only motivate you when you take the amph. The very first day you don&#039;t take it, is going to suck so bad, you&#039;ll quit the whole idea, and probably seek out another gram.&nbsp; I only went to buying it by the gram, when my shrink fell ill, and I was too old to start over with someone newer and younger. I&#039;m sure I forgot more, than they&#039;ll ever know. <br /><br />Back to the point. When you take amphetamine, sure, you&#039;ll get motivated to do some physical activity, like clean the house, maybe keep the kitchen cleaner than you used to. Make those extra trips to the trash to get rid of all that shit in the corner....etc. <br /><br />Eventually, you&#039;ll need more and more to achieve the same effect. You&#039;ll lose more weight, more mass, less energy. Now you&#039;re taking Amph just to feel normal. <br /><br />My advice? Try to go without it for 1 or 2 days. Both will suck, and you&#039;ll have moments of craving amph, along with a voracious appetite, but all that goes away, and you start to think &quot;Hey I can get by without it&quot; <br /><br />Then, for me, the ADD symptoms come back, the confusion, the want and need to accomplish everything at once, yet the mere thought confounds me to the point of immobilization. <br /><br />In closing <br /><br />There is no magic bullet. <br /><br />Give it a break, two days before your first workout, then try it for the 1st day. Maybe even the next time. Then try working out without it, and expect it to be harder. - You seem not to be that addicted. Yet. <br /><br />Finally I&#039;m back with a regular doc, and only hit the road for &#039;in between&#039; doses. <br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />jagfug 8)
