				I&#039;m prescribed amphetamine salts, which I use more than prescribes - but nothing over the top. Because the prices are disproportionately insane, I tried methamphetamine.&nbsp; Tiny amounts taken orally with water.&nbsp; By tiny I mean .25 works out to roughly 10 doses.&nbsp; The methamphetamine seems to have the same effect as the amphetamine salt. Provide one exception, I have this constant fucking ringing in my ear or head.<br /><br />While the wife working in the medical field, she has no idea way its occurring, she also has no idea what I am doing.&nbsp; It&#039;s gotten so bad that I&#039;ve made an appointment with an audiologist.&nbsp; Additionally, my vision is slightly blurred, but its probably because I haven&#039;t changed my disposable contacts in a year, ha..&nbsp; Obviously, I don&#039;t want to list my life, but I do work 14- 18 hours a day - 7 days a week, with or without supplements, so this might be a sources as well.<br /><br />There is a definite correlation with use, but this does amount to causation.&nbsp; Since I cannot tell anyone, I&#039;m here to ask one if this is common with other users as much as I despise anecdotal evidence. Google searches return a billion links to rehabs. <br /><br />Any info appreciated.

				Also tried meth first time recently, administration is orally 5-10 mg tops, occassionally with amph salts - kindda works like old adderall, when it had meth in it. Also had tinnitus for a couple of days, but it seems to have gone away for now. Obviously if it kicks in again, I would take a pause and start again with meth later. If the tinnitus does not go away, I would end using meth. Never had problems just using amph salts.<br /><br />I would suggest go for some memantine, just to deal with potential neurotoxicity.<br /><br />But yeah working 14-18 hours daily is crazy, so it might be stress-related.

				I shot up 500mgs or so of molly once. My ears rang for a week or more. I mean loud too. So loud I could feel my teeth vibrating. I thought I had blown a gasket for sure, but I healed up.

				When you bang meth I have heard it makes your ears ring. I&#039;ve never heard of it happening when you take it orally, especially in the tiny doses you&#039;re talking about. I smoke meth almost every day and have for close to 2 years, I have never noticed my ears ringing though.

				I&#039;ve been taking prescribed ADD meds more than half my life, amphetamines, and in the past two years I&#039;ve used a lot of illicit amphetamine/meth/speed whatever, and I have noticed a constant tinnitus whenever I hear quiet. I don&#039;t notice it most of the time, but whenever I notice quiet its there and whenever I think of it to. I also don&#039;t have a regular sleeping schedule at all.

				There are a number of drugs that cause the effect you are having.&nbsp; Aspirin in larger than normal doses can cause the same thing (I found that out taking a bunch of 222&#039;s when I was younger - Aspirin and Codeine).<br /><br />There isn&#039;t much you can do about it other than lower your dose as far as I know.

				After a visit with a specialist, it&#039;s organic.&nbsp; Fuck, I just turned 40, and the body is falling apart.&nbsp; Apparently, nutrition is key to quell the ringing.&nbsp; I wish there was a pill to replace eating - save some time.&nbsp; After drinking 3 nutritional shake from Costco (like slimfast) it&#039;s all but gone. <br /><br />If it matters, I take a small amount because I &quot;don&#039;t&quot; wanna get high.&nbsp; DOn&#039;t get me wrong, I love getting high, but not while working.&nbsp; When I do take too much, I&#039;m too happy and tend to get stuck doing repetitive tasks.... like writing a 10,000 word email that could have been conveyed with couple of sentences.&nbsp; ADD has it pros and cons - try doing a logic puzzle after some crystal.&nbsp; You cannot stop until it&#039;s done, at least for me. <br /><br />Thanks for all posts!

				yeah well, i actually have tinnitus from the teenage years, a fucker threw a few M-80&#039;s and they blew up right at the back of my head, have been hearing the ringing for YEARS...(permenant)<br /><br />the first two days, i literally was on the brink of going insane, but its tolerable now, obviously after so long...weird part is...i will never know what true silence is. creepy huh?<br /><br />but smoking DMT makes a REAL LOUD ringing come up as you do it...as for meth, not sure, maybe i just get super sensitive and know more of whats going on around me.

				Gawd, that sucks.&nbsp; This could easily drive a person insane.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of my panoply of therapists recommended classical music. Not my music taste, but if you are in isolation try listening to classical music without vocals.&nbsp; It a particular type, but the name eludes me at the moment.&nbsp; I think its Baroc largo.&nbsp; The beat mimics your heat rate and it significantly helps with concentration and relaxation.&nbsp; I grew up on NOFX, Pennywise, and numerous other punk bands, so I was very skeptical.&nbsp; First time I tried it, I was like where the fuck has this been all my life.&nbsp; &nbsp;The quieter it is the louder the ringing, for me.&nbsp; This helped. <br /><br />Edit - it&#039;s called Baroque largo tempo.&nbsp;
