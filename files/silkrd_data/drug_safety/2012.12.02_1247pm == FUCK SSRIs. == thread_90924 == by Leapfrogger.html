				So recently, after maybe three months of preparation, I finally placed my first order on the Road. I decided to buy some MDMA, because 1) I haven&#039;t rolled in five years, 2) it&#039;s a buyer&#039;s market for MDMA right now and, 3) my friend and I didn&#039;t have any plans for New Year&#039;s yet.<br /><br />I came home to find the box waiting for me. I stared at it in astonishment... okay, no, let&#039;s be honest, I pretty much ripped it apart in giddy excitement as soon as I was away from prying eyes. Then I came upon The Product. Holy shit, it was so beautiful. Wow, it really does smell like licorice. And these crystals...this looks like a fucking prop, I mean it&#039;s too pretty to be real. (Keep in mind I&#039;d never seen pure MDMA before, nor have I ever seen meth.)<br />&nbsp;<br />So, yeah, I bought it for NYE, but my friend (who I won&#039;t be seeing until then) knew there was no way I was gonna have molly just sitting in a drawer for a month- and I had a whole gram! I had to try it out, even if I was gonna be alone. I held out until the weekend at least.<br /><br />I put a total of 140 mgs into two capsules (it wouldn&#039;t fit into one) and, for the first time ever, plugged them.<br /><br />I sat, put on In Rainbows, and waited.<br /><br />An hour went by. An hour and a half.<br /><br />Are these some exceptionally thick capsules I used? Let&#039;s check to make sure everything went as planned up there... Hm. Not feeling any capsules. What the fuck...<br /><br />Maybe they just went up really far and still haven&#039;t dissolved yet.<br /><br />Two hours. I feel a bit more excited, but that might just be from the anticipation.<br /><br />Fuck this, I&#039;ll take what was supposed to be the 80mg booster now. Orally this time.<br /><br />Oh my god, my jaw is clenching! This is good, this is good.<br /><br />Fuck it, lemme rail 50 grams.<br /><br />YOW! That burned.<br /><br />I wonder how my eyes look. WHOA, my pupils are fucking huge.<br /><br />Two and a half hours. Man, that&#039;s a nice nasty drip I got going. I feel warmer than I did before, I guess.<br /><br />Three hours. It becomes obvious that it&#039;s not gonna hit me.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t make sense. This exact product has been described as at least &quot;great&quot;, if not the best MDMA they&#039;ve ever had, in every single review I read.<br /><br />And then I remembered. Last weekend, before making any plans to buy MDMA, I had been drinking all night and wanted to pop some pills before going to bed. I didn&#039;t have anything on hand, but I wanted to swallow SOMETHING, so I washed down one or two or three 20mg-Citaloprams with my last beer. Citalopram is some anti-anxiety bullshit of which I was once prescribed a non-pharmaceutical (he instructed me to cut the pills into 1/4ths) dosage, by a psychiatrist whom I never visited again.<br /><br />Citalopram is an SSRI, and SSRIs tend to, ahem, &quot;weaken the effects&quot; of MDMA. Weaken the effects to almost nothing. And one study gives you the impression that Citalopram is the absolute worst of them.<br /><br />The infuriating thing is that I fucking KNEW this- about MDMA and SSRIs in general, anyway. I even remember when I stopped taking Citalopram a while ago, thinking, &quot;Well, it doesn&#039;t seem to be making much of a difference, and any MDMA experience I might have is going to be far more therapeutic than this shit, so I&#039;d better be ready!&quot; I wasn&#039;t in denial about there being a potential problem, I&#039;d just honestly forgotten I&#039;d taken it.<br /><br />The lesson here? Don&#039;t swallow random pills just to do it. Pay better attention to what you&#039;re putting in your body.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m to blame for this. And it&#039;s testament to the purity of the product that I felt almost nothing- if it was cut with speed or even caffeine, those would have come through. But I didn&#039;t even have a caffeine buzz.<br /><br />So it looks like we&#039;re waiting till New Year&#039;s Eve after all. Until then I&#039;ll be jogging ten miles every day and taking oatmeal enemas every night in hopes of clearing this zombifying, ecstasy-killing SSRI out of my fucking system.<br /><br />Good thing I&#039;ve got some shrooms coming in next week.<br /><br />God bless Silk Road

				With me it was xanax I had taken about a week earlier for legitimate purposes, they kinda blocked the effects of psilocybin, I have no idea why. I&#039;ll never take a psychedelic again unless I am sure there are no residual effects or remains of anything else in my system.<br /><br />goblin

				Yeah I have a buddy who was taking Celexa and dropped a roll and some 2C-B and felt damn near nothing. SSRI&#039;s + serotonin, or dopamine in most cases if you have a partial agonist is a no go.

				Same thing here with my prescription SSRI and mj. Doesn&#039;t block it completely but have to work much harder for liftoff (I haven&#039;t been able to get shrooms and so have been trying to &quot;replicate&quot; the effects with 200-300 hits of mj on a vape).<br /><br />And then, just for shits and giggles, I get WD coming off the SSRI. Lord love the medical system.

				Wow I never knew that about ssri&#039;s and mdma.&nbsp; I have some molly i have been saving for the right time and I regularly (every other day or so) take a benzo.&nbsp; I see one person had a problem with xanax and molly, should I not take benzos for a while before i take the molly?&nbsp; How long do you all suggest?

You don&#039;t, really. Or at least, I wouldn&#039;t have thought you could till I started 5 hour mass-vaping sessions. These aren&#039;t little hits. These are &quot;inhale for 10; hold for 10&quot; each, in sets of 20 (ie: no fresh air until that set is done). On a good night, I blastoff around 120-175. On a great night, more like 75. Off nights I can&#039;t make it happen at all. (Yes, I am now in the process of finding a suitable high-grade mj vendor on SR and can&#039;t wait to see what these techniques and quality product will do to my li&#039;l ol&#039; brain)&nbsp; I am the high monk of doing more with less. If I get much better at this, I expect to be getting high off of air soon. (and if the laws in my country tighten much more, I&#039;m gonna have to)

				Thanks for the advice/commiserations, guys. I may wait another week before taking the shrooms just to be on the safe side.<br /><br />The halflife of Citalopram is 35 hours, so in a week 90% of it should have been gone. Assuming I took 3 pills, that&#039;s still only 6mgs in my system. And it still blocked that shit completely. <br /><br />What a wonderful class of drugs, the SSRIs. About as effective as placebos except in the areas of sexual dysfunction, lethargy, weight gain and blocking of the effects of the most wonderful psychedelics known to man.

				I believed the anti-depressive fx of ssri&#039;s when I went off them cold turkey, hit wd, and felt like life had no meaning whatsoever. So... mission accomplished?&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />But yeah, kind of the perfect conspiracy theory drug. Dose a population so they don&#039;t get too sad, no matter how shitty things get, but not too happy or inspired, either.

				This post caught my attention.<br /><br />I stopped taking the SSRI Sertraline (brand name: Zoloft) about 2 months ago, after being on it for a couple of years.<br /><br />Feeling pretty fucking stoked about it too, haven&#039;t looked back.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering when I should consider rolling again, because it&#039;s been a few years, and I would fucking love to toll my tits off again.<br /><br />Anyone got any experience or facts to report in this matter?

				I&#039;ve been reading more and more about SSRIs and psychedelics. I only found articles and studies about SSRIs killing the effects of MDMA and LSD, but there were plenty of anecdotes on Shroomery about people not being able to get a proper trip out of psilocybin mushrooms while on SSRIs. It was nowhere near as unanimous as it was for the MDMA; some people even claimed they tripped harder while on SSRIs (I somehow doubt this. Maybe they were just better shrooms. But they&#039;d know better than I would.)<br /><br />Anyway, it occured to me that I took well over six dried grams of P. cubensis back when I was taking Citalopram regularly and I didn&#039;t trip at all. I thought they were just exceptionally weak shrooms, but now I know there&#039;s another possibility...<br /><br />While I&#039;d love to set up a proper experiment with SSRIs and psilocybin, I&#039;ll never be taking another SSRI again, so I&#039;ll leave it to someone else. :)<br /><br />(Disclaimer: If you&#039;re taking an SSRI and it&#039;s working for you, more power to you. I know it&#039;s annoying to hear people ragging on a drug, illegal or not, that has improved your life. I will say though that I know at least half a dozen people who have been on SSRIs and none of them liked how it made them feel. YMMV.)
