				&nbsp; &nbsp; Hello Silkroad this will be my first thread, possibly my only thread but definitely the most important thread to me and possibly others. I put this in the Drug safety section because in my case of having celiac, it is very important to know the ingredients of drugs I ingest due to the health risks of ingesting gluten containing substances. I think a greater awareness amongst the Vendors and buyers is needed when it comes to allergens because some allergic reactions prove fatal or in my case auto-immune responses destroy the body over time and cause long term damage and pain.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I see a lot of vendors of prescription drugs do list the manufacturer of their product which is helpful but at the same time there are many who don&#039;t or who claim its this brand and send another. It would be helpful if the vendor went the extra mile and stated on their product page that this item contains Gluten, lactose, soy, etc because a lot of websites that list gluten free drugs are wrong and uninformative and calling the manufacturers themselves is a hassle but obviously vendors are busy people and we can&#039;t expect them to do everything. And to those who sell non-prescription drugs like cocaine, heroin and MDMA all I can ask of you is please do not cut your product with flour or anything like that. Maybe this thread can be used for buyers and vendors to state whether their product contains gluten, lactose, soy, etc. For example a celiac like me buys some cocaine or MDMA off a vendor and after using said product I have a reaction so I can come to this thread and state that Blankety blanks cocaine or MDMA glutened me or gave me the milk shits or whatever, get the picture?lol <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; And I gotta give Dance4Life a big thumbs up and send some positive energy his way for the Gluten Free cannabis edibles he/she was offering, even though I was not able to enjoy one I love to see that there are people out there who are aware of this horrible disease and want to help make life a little easier for us.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope that this thread turns into something because it would hands down be the most helpful thread for me and fellow celiacs and others who have intolerances/allergies to other substances. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To start off I&#039;d like to state that I don&#039;t believe Etizolam and the OP oxycodones to be gluten free due to my recent glutening but strict diet...strict food diet that is obviously I let drugs gluten me due to the assumption that pills and other drugs would be gluten free so be weary of those and help add to this thread please and thank you.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Peace from MOJO.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I understand the concern for gluten free drugs, but for pharma drugs that shouldn&#039;t be the seller&#039;s responsibility.<br /><br />If it&#039;s difficult to find accurate info, how would you expect the seller to find it? They just sell the pills, not manufacture them.

				Indeed It is not the sellers responsibility, its is the consumers. I&#039;m saying that for the pills if the vendor accurately stated the name of the manufacturer on the products page then maybe someone like me or others could find out for ourselves the ingredients of the pills and then either tell the vendor who could then state the ingredients on the product page to save others the trouble or just state if the product is safe on this thread. And for sellers of others drugs all i can do is ask not to cut product with flours or other common food allergens because I do like a nice shit after doing a line of good coc, but i dont want to be shitting like that the next couple weeks either. lol

				That&#039;s true - most pharma sellers do post the manufacturer of the pills, and/or a picture. You can google the pill numbers on the picture and find out the manufacturer that way.<br /><br />If you have serious allergy issues, I would avoid all non-pharma manufactured items. Way too much risk due to the myriad of cutting agents.
