				so i recently tried heroin for the first time. i got .5 of #4 from NoGenRx and its amazing stuff. but i have been looking at listings and have seen #3 heroin for less than half the price. i dont shoot up, im a snorter, or with #3 i would be smoking. my question is what would be a better value for me high wise? snorting more expensive #4 or smoking cheaper #3? thanks for the answers guys. oh or also how would smoking tar compare

				Well I like #4 because I IV. The cheap #3 will still do the job but wont be anywhere near the quality of No Genrx. <br />If you want to try #3 I reccomend Psilocin (not sure if correct spelling) he is same prices as GenRX but is #3 and very potent dope.<br /><br />Listings you see for cheaper will still get you high but will just be less potent.

				producers sell #3 as 50%base 50% caffeine<br />and sell #4 as a pure Hcl salt 88.7% active molecule<br /><br />So the white heroine is usually stronger, but when your not getting it off the cook it can be full of any old crap.

				you can snort #3, since i dont smoke i know. just generally its going to start less pure cause of the caffeine. all relative though, cause each may be cut so decent #3 may be better that low quality #4 <br /><br />lol. exactly 88.7 percent diacetylmorphine<br />every producer. every time.<br />wheres your reference on that one lol<br /><br />dont know why i thought it was so funny, sorry. but just fyi, #4 is not commonly going to be 85 percent or greater active, hardly ever even refined to that purity. opis pebbles may be up there and thats some of the very best dope ever

				How would #3 and #4 compare with say 30 mg of oxycodone(oxycontin)? or 40mg of oxymorphone (opana)

				I usually IV 8mg of hydromorphone. 40-60mg of oxycodone.<br />I start with half a .1 (50mg) of the H (IV) but usually do 100mg. This is street h though. Im getting some from No GenRX in the mail today and I expect it to be much more pure.<br /><br />

				So say I get a good buzz off 20-30 mg of oxycodone and get rocked off of 50-60 <br />would .1 of that #4 get me rocked (snorting) <br />Is it worth it to try since Opana is so scarce?

A lot of reading on bluelight, wiki, drugsforums, google. The 88.7 is technically the molecular weight for morphine but i thought it would be good for a starting point. <br />When we buy heroine which has not been made by a pharmaceutical company both types of this drug will contain other by-products of manufacturing, reducing the potency, such as diacetyl codeine. <br />Being in the part of Australia where a single point of heroine will cost Au$150 we are generally supplied with very high quality. Most of the highest grade illegal H originates in the golden triangle (east asia) where they have been making this since the Vietnam war. Only since the Afghanistan war has the golden crescent started making #4. From what i have seen and experienced since SR opened i theorize that the cooks of the crescent don&#039;t clean the product as good before turning it into a salt.<br /><br />If you are snorting H for the first time and have very little tolerance it is safest to snort match head size bumps (10mg) waiting at least 10 minutes between toots. It is really easy to over do it when you start snorting as the high is not what most people expect. It probably wont rock you like mdma or meth or even weed but the warm fuzzy blanket of invincibility it gives you is second to none! Wherever your product originates from, please treat her with respect!<br /><br />-Peace<br />
