				I got some 50mg statex morphine today so i decided to shoot up. I mixed about half the pill (to test) with 60 units of water and shot it, using the same exact process I&#039;ve used for everything for years (filtered, cleaned spoon and arm with alcohol,&nbsp; etc). The solution was surprisingly clear, but left pink/orange bubbly looking leftovers in the spoon which was weird.<br />Immediately I got a burning, tingling (like painful burning pins and needles) in my chest and my heart rate rose, the burning/tingling traveled up my neck to the very top of my head (scalp) where it burned and tingled for a few moments and I also noticed it was in my arm too. I also got really hot, pretty much sweating.&nbsp; I looked in the mirror to see if my pupils had changed and they hadn&#039;t but my neck was red and blotchy which disappeared when the burning did.<br />I immediately panicked thinking I injected some sort of poison/pill not meant for injecting like birth control haha because I couldn&#039;t find any pictures of these specific pills, but the feeling subsided after a few minutes and I felt okay with just a headache.<br /><br />A couple hours later I decided to sniff it and see what happened, and things were fine I did about a quarter of what was left at a time..<br />But then I just crushed up another and snorted half and my eyeball started burning (same side I sniffed up). so I had to rinse it with water. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done so many searches and I thought maybe I got a dirty hit, but I can&#039;t find any real information on that and someone hacked saferinjecting.net so that&#039;s no help, and I&#039;m guessing it wasn&#039;t cotton fever because it didn&#039;t last very long. I think the whole thing lasted 5 minutes. I was thinking maybe I&#039;m a little allergic to morphine, maybe in &quot;high&quot; doses at once? But I take all other opioids IV fine (H, oxyC, OxyM, hydroM).<br /><br />Has anyone experience anything similar, ever? Or know what could have happened?<br />Any information is appreciated, thanks for reading.

				That&#039;s normal bud.<br /><br />Morphine gives a huge histamine reaction.. the pins and needles..<br /><br />that&#039;s the rush off of morphine.. totally normal.<br /><br />you will come to enjoy it.<br /><br />look up morphine + pins and needles on google.

				what you felt is exactly what the drug does to your body, that is how you can tell that you got the right stuff, if anybody wants some more of the strongest pill on the market i am the onl one with them, a few others have some but they got them from a shipment that was not paid for!!!. if you are purchasing theses pills from anywhere except me they are stolen or not paid for especially if they are coming from someone in the usa. <br />if you have any questions on my pills give me a pm? <br />by the way im having a sale right now even cheaper than ever .

				If you ever visit a hospital here in the USA and they are giving you morphine you&#039;ll notice they inject it very very slowly.&nbsp; This is to minimize that burning you&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; yet at the same time it also minimizes your rush.&nbsp; All i know is any story i have about the greatest rush i ever had includes the sentence &quot;i thought i was going to die&quot; so it sounds like you had fun to me.

It was a deal I couldn&#039;t pass up, seriously. I could afford a habit with those prices.<br /><br />Should I be getting this &quot;rush&quot; with such a small dose? <br />That dose wasn&#039;t enough for me to get high off (I guess there was something there, but very very light) of but I got the effects of histamine reaction/rush. When I get a rush off of other drugs they are high enough doses where I am sufficiently high afterward...<br />Honestly can&#039;t imagine getting used to the feeling, almost don&#039;t even want to do it again, but I think I&#039;ll take some anti-histamine tomorrow and see what happens.

				I usually inject a whole 50mg pill at once and use 100 units (or 120) of water...Morphine is soluble at 60mg/100 units (so 100 units can only hold about 60mg of Morphine). I inject one 50mg pill and then inject another 50mg right after and will feel pretty good....sometimes I will go through 4 or 5 of those pills a day (and still crave more!) but my heroin tolerance is kinda up there.<br /><br />I usually order a bunch of these morphine IR pills to keep on hand for when Im out of heroin.

				This stuff is definitely worth keeping around, It&#039;s way better than Suboxone for your off H days I think. I cannot believe the prices people charge for Subs on here, when I was on it granted I had insurance but I got 90 8mg/2mg pills for $45. People sell them on here from 12-20+ bucks EACH, it&#039;s just outrageous IMO.<br />You definitely have the better idea...<br /><br />Thanks again for all the info, everyone.
