				So as most of you may or may not know, when you smoke methamphetamine with a glass pipe, the vapor cools as you inhale it leaving an even coating of white residue. The residue is meth of course, and the more you use the pipe, the thicker the residue gets. After a while you can scrape the white coating off and have an entire bowl of meth you might not have even known was there!<br /><br />Anyways, I usually use a straw or the plastic ink thing out of a pen to scrape it. What do you guys use? Straws or pens are okay, but sometimes the residue is really stubborn and won&#039;t come off. I&#039;m just curious as to whether or not there is something better out there to scrape off more/all the meth back into the bowl. What would be perfect would be to find a really tiny metal tube or something lol.. But I&#039;ve found that if the end you are using to scrape is rounded at all, it doesn&#039;t work. I don&#039;t really know how to explain it, like if you use a straw it works, but if you then melted the end of the straw with a lighter just a tiny bit and made the end slightly rounded, it won&#039;t work anymore.<br /><br /><br />I dunno, anyways your advice is appreciated! ;)

				Cut a metal coat hanger with side cut pliers. This will leave a sharp V point to the end of the coat hanger. You will find that it scrapes very well and if it becomes dull then cut off a little more.

				Not sure how efficient this is, but after I&#039;ve scraped and smoked as much as I can, I drop a tiny bit of water down the stem.&nbsp; Then I carefully boil the water in the bubble and create a little steam. After the steam rolls down the stem, it&#039;s usually looking pretty clean.&nbsp; Then I slowly boil of the water, and can usually get a few more hits off the residue left over.<br /><br />This might be wasteful, but like I said, I do it after scraping anyway.&nbsp; It does leave your pipe looking nice and clean for your next order 8)<br /><br />Do this carefully if you try it.&nbsp; The steam makes the entire pipe hot, and I usually hold the stem with a kitchen towel and boil slow.&nbsp; Depending on how much water you&#039;ve added, it can take a few cool-downs before you get it all.

				The quality of product I have tried in the past has left only white residue in the stem itself and I have only ever used a mini torch lighter leaving no carbon on the outside. With this technique, I never had to scrape at all but just heated the stem with the torch and vaporized the meth and inhaled through the small hole on the bowl. It worked for me really well with no waste at all. <br /><br />With that said, I would smoke my entire supply before working on the residue. That way I had quite a bit of residue left and it would keep me zinging for another day.

				With my pipes or tooters, I just fill them with water and drink the residue.&nbsp; Seems to get most of it as well as lasts a little longer than smoked.&nbsp; Good way to finish off a binge.

				finger over both ends, and use the lighter to melt the residue then &quot;drip&quot; it into the bowl. Ive seen others put the glass on an electric stove and used a straw for the vapor.

				I got these little bamboo stick spoons that came with an old weed vaporizor, but I think they also sell em in japan as ear cleaning sticks. These do wonders for scraping, and also for cleaning the bubble between packs if you get residue. These sticks are multi purpose drug tools for me, there great for scooping up powder from bags and grabbing those little ass shards off the bottom ect...<br /><br />Out of everything I&#039;ve tried I found my method works best for me, using a torch lighter works good too but is too quick if your out of product.

				i just created a half-ass pipe with a large clear pen and good ole tinfoil.&nbsp; smoked a lil, maybe just 80 mgs or so total, but wow yea i had always disregarded the resin in the past but it&#039;s just like a white sheet inside the pen.&nbsp; i really never knew that stuff was still useable.<br />years and years ago i took a trip with friends to a legendary dealer&#039;s house.&nbsp; he threw crystals down like others might thrown down shwag.&nbsp; he had a water bong with a meth pipe retrofitted to it.&nbsp; i knew meth was very water soluble, and was just baffled that it still made it through.&nbsp; i think he loaded like 100 to 150 mg for me, and i have never since gotten as high as then from smoking.&nbsp; smoked poured out like i had taken a bong hit of some chronic, but it was as gentle as water vapor.<br />that water tho..&nbsp; with all he smoked.&nbsp; there had to be an 8 ball in that stuff.&nbsp; <br />if u slow evaporated that water u would just get like a sheet of reconstituted crystal wouldn&#039;t u?<br />hehe i bet he just threw it out every couple of days too.<br /><br />*destiny*

				All sound a bit desperate to me.....<br /><br />But what I do is melt it back into the bowl by closing both holes.<br /><br />Ahhh the dregs of the pipe

				Back when I used it, I just heated the walls of the pipe with a torch lighter to vaporize the residue.

				I usually heat the pipe at the bottom of the stem near the bowl and if there is enough meth, it will form a nice little teardrop and drip back down into the bowl. If it doesn&#039;t do that, I either scrape the rest of the pipe (I&#039;ve been using a piece of a clothes hanger as someone suggested, works great :)) down into the bowl or I leave the residue to build up more until it does form a droplet.<br />
