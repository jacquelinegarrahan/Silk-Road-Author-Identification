				Dear community, <br /><br />I have mephedrone, lsd and mdma on hand and would like to do them all this weekend.&nbsp; <br /><br />My question is, as Mephedrone depletes serotonin (as MDMA does too), I was wondering if LSD + MDMA was ok on the day after a mephedrone evening ? In the sense that, would the LSD trip be pleasant if there is not much serotonin left in my brain ? Should I do LSD on its own without the MDMA&nbsp; ?&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me know, <br /><br />Thanks !

				I would do the LSD and MDMA the first night and the Mephedrone the next night with expected diminishing returns.<br /><br />We all know a good candy flip works out well but if you dun sapped your serotonin the night before with Mephedrone&#039;s not terribly effective use of it coupled with the high desire to redose, I think you&#039;d end up on Mephedrone the first night and then have a fairly lack luster candy flip which would probably take a pretty good dose of both CID and MDMA to even get off the ground. Since Mephedrone also plays with dopamine, more than the other two drugs my suspicion is if you do it the second night you&#039;ll still get some speedyness out of it and probably a good headache to boot. <br /><br />If you like ACID on it&#039;s own, and who wouldn&#039;t? I would just drop the acid the first night and the MDMA the second night maybe chased with Mephedrone if you want to keep it going or ran out of MDMA. To have a good trip on acid you need some serotonin but acid doesn&#039;t burn up the stuff like MDMA does so I&#039;d normally want to do the Cid on a full brain and then let MDMA suck it all dry. Suspect you&#039;d have a cleaner trip but if I have a bag of drugs I normally just take a bag of drugs regardless of all my planing so best of luck!

				That sounds sensible, thanks for the advice. <br /><br />One more question about candyflipping, most people advise dropping the molly at T+2.00 after the cid, meaning that the molly comedown would occur at T+5.00. Considering that acid lasts 12 hours, wouldn&#039;t the comedown affect the rest of the cid trip ?

				So two hours in is pretty nice but I normally end up bumping if I take that ride. I think for most people the MDMA at two hours in sets a nice tone that the LSD just rides on. If you tend to come down hard on MDMA the landings off a candy flip are normally a little more graceful. The goal with the two hours in is that you want to be peaking on the LSD and MDMA at about the same time since they are delicious together. Some people take the MDMA earlier but often that seems to make the LSD less felt in my experience. Others take it at the four hour mark and just come down off both at the same time. <br /><br />I find I get the most fun out of my night by doing the first does of MDMA at the two hour mark and then a good bump at about four hours if I am feeling it and then I just coast in the rest of the night on LSD at which point my brain has had enough and I&#039;m ready for bed after a nice 8-10 hour ride.<br /><br />The trick with candy flipping is that you are still going to be really high on LSD and so you don&#039;t feel that sharp MDMA drop off as much as you do on MDMA alone.<br /><br />Just for the record, it&#039;s strongly advised to have done both of these on there own before you flip them. MDMA on the come up for a newbie can be a little harsh and that could change the tone of the night if you don&#039;t know what fun awaits you after the initial rush stops messing with you.<br /><br />Otherwise, you&#039;ll love it and have a great time.
