				First off don&#039;t be home on LSD be outside in nature. Secondly, if you are basing off of SRs potency, the LSD has been way over estimated all the time. That is a lot of acid, I am experienced and usually take around 500 mics. Be safe.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				That setting (sweating the &#039;rents coming home) does not sound like a fun trip to me, especially with that high of a dose. You should be functioning somewhat soberly after 12 hours, but if it was me I would probably be getting some heavy, mid-trip waves of paranoia about my parents coming home early or whatever. But hey, that&#039;s just my brain on acid ;)<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />weedsaves

				thats pretty high dosed. for me the trip itself always lasts around 7 hours and than there is about 3 hours of after effects.&nbsp;

				It shouldn&#039;t be more than 12 hours, unless you spread out the tabs instead of taking them all at once. Though, in my opinion, that&#039;s a waste of acid since it only prolongs the trip and doesn&#039;t increase the effects. So, if you are going to do that much, do it all at once for best effects. <br /><br />I agree with Stormtrooper420 and weedsaves. First, don&#039;t put yourself in a situation where you will be paranoid about your parents coming home. Also, being stuck inside a house is not a good idea, in my experience. I took a 250 ug trip one night in my room. BAD idea. I didn&#039;t have a bad trip because I was fortunate enough to have a really positive mindset going into it/throughout it, and I&#039;m really good at coaxing myself when I have bad thoughts. It was a great trip in that I had amazing visuals, however, it would&#039;ve been better spent outside during the daytime. Tripping in my house at night was SO strange. I wasn&#039;t able to leave my house (nor did I think that would even be a good idea considering it was nighttime and I was tripping alone), so I felt trapped. You&#039;ll find yourself caught in a time loop most likely if you aren&#039;t free to go wherever you want and do whatever you want. I don&#039;t know, but looking at the same four walls for seven hours straight can be a mindfuck. <br /><br />Anyway, I hope that helps. Best of luck to you in your LSD adventures!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				Taking large dosages of LSD certainly does increase the duration. You won&#039;t be &quot;peaking&quot; longer than usual, per se, but with high dosages, it will be kind of like being on speed while &quot;coming down&quot;, until you&#039;re able to get to sleep, which will be more difficult to do at a &quot;reasonable&quot; time the higher the dosage. A high enough dosage will have lingering effects past the 24 hour mark if one is not able to get to sleep. Consider this before taking a large dose in your parents house.

				You should have no trouble fitting a lucy trip into a 12 hour time span.&nbsp; Higher doses don&#039;t really add any length to the trip, just intensity.&nbsp; As others have said, I&#039;d recommend tripping out in nature instead of in the home.&nbsp; Even on lower doses of LSD, tripping at home can get boring/awkward in a heartbeat, and higher doses will just intensity the uncomfortable feeling if one arises.&nbsp; <br /><br />I, too, would warn you to avoid taking 600-700ug of LSD, you won&#039;t find it much more profound than a 400-500ug dose.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken several &gt;1mg doses before, and while it is definitely a bit more intense than normal sized doses, it&#039;s really not going to take you anywhere new.&nbsp; I find that above 500ug, it becomes much harder to function and explore both physically and mentally, and it also becomes harder to remember those ego-shattering, life-changing self-realizations that LSD can initiate.&nbsp; Having explored this chemical quite a bit, definitely the most out of any psychedelic, my sweet spot is around 300ug.<br /><br />I still learn new things from 150ug trips that all the time; LSD has more to teach you than you even know, even at standard or sub-standard doses.&nbsp; <br /><br />TL;DR:&nbsp; Yes, you can fit a 6-700ug LSD trip in the span of 12 hours from come-up to nearly baseline.&nbsp;
