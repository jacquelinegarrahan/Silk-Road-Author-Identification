				I was really down last night so I went out to meet an acquaintance for some drinks....I odn&#039;t know her that well, but she seems pretty cool.<br /><br />at about 8pm took 1mg xanax<br />at bar over 4 hours drank 3 strong cocktails, took 2 shots<br />my friend said she had the best coke and weedat her place and invited me over...<br />Drank a glass of wine<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done coke in a while, but this was grainy, not powdery....like a badly crushed up pill... we used about 2 small baggies each...not sure of weights or anything...She says her boyfriend gives it to her for half price or some hit like that a bag...then we smoked a bunch of weed....I got nauseated, tired...didn&#039;t feel at all like coke but since i was so stupid and intoxicated I kept taking lines.<br /><br />Today I feel like fucking garbage, stomach issues...tired etc...do I ride it out or is badly cut coke a serious health risk...<br /><br />Like I said, i have not done it in years, so I never really encountered something grainy and cut so badly.

				kitkat82, from your description, it does sound more like crushed up pills than Cocaine to me. Your stomach issues could be contributed to a mixture of cocktails, shots and wine with some xanax, crushed up something and some pot thrown in for good measure. Looking at all those things written down is actually starting to make myself feel a little sick (lol). I don&#039;t think you&#039;re facing any significant health risk as such, more the affects of a combination of different substances taken together when they shouldn&#039;t be.&nbsp; :) :) :)

				well i dunno. wash out your nose with salt water?<br />xanax and alcohol is a shitty combo. i think that fucked you up. <br />i dont really know much about levamisole.....&nbsp; its used to kill tapeworms... why would anyone cut shit with that? <br />maybe you could help out your friend. if shes snorting that cut up shit a lot shes gonna do damage. give her some proper drugs....

				AQctually, coke off the block looks like some crushed up pills - you need to hear a bown and crush that coke with a warmed spoon, crush it till its a fine powder.<br /><br />Tjhen get the EX test kits out, they have one now for levismole - a substance that rreally outs me off coke because now Europeans and Americans are getting levismole and if the SA put maybe 10% in, we might get some 25% levismole mix which would fuck up you and leave your immune system really lowered. <br /><br />I&#039;m doing a few tests of coke bought off here - the basic strength test plus the levismiole and of course speed which is the easy way to make some weak coke more active.<br /><br />Also xanaz, any benzos and alsocol, plus weed, all counter the stimulant effect of coke leading to more lines.<br /><br />Try coke without alcohol - and use the xanax when you come home or decide to call it a night.<br /><br />Cheers, hope your feeling better now.
