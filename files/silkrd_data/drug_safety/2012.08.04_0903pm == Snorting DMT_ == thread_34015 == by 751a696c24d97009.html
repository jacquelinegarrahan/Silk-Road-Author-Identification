				Anyone here have any experience snorting DMT? I&#039;ve heard that you can but I don&#039;t know much about it. You need a MAOI to use it orally, but would you need one to take it intranasally? I&#039;ve heard that it burns and you need a little extra, but I feel like this would be a good way to experiment with higher doses because when smoking it you blast off before you&#039;re finished hitting the pipe sometimes. This way you could do it all in one or two quick lines.<br /><br />Any thoughts/advice?

				People over at DMT Nexus are suggesting 80 to 120 mg for snorting DMT, and it appears to be quite painful. I&#039;ve done my share of shitty coke before though, so I&#039;ll give it a shot. Most people report the trip lasting at least twenty minutes, usually at least half an hour, and many of them also say the trip was more intense both visually and mentally. People have reported these things with the average smoking dose as well as higher doses specified for snorting.<br /><br />So it appears that you should use a little more but get a more intense and lengthier trip by snorting it. I&#039;m definitely going to be trying this and I&#039;ll report back so others can see what it&#039;s like.

				Alright, I&#039;ve been reading some more and most people are reporting 30-45 minute trips with an hour or so comedown, some people a little less than that but most are saying 30-45.

				Imagine a bullet ant crawling into your nose and repeatedly biting, with no hope of retrieving him out.<br /><br />That is what snorting freebase feels like (and I&#039;ve heard fumarate doesn&#039;t fare too well in the nostrils either), and if you cannot hold your own with psychedelics I also HIGHLY advise starting low. 50mg or so, 75mg was enough for me to break through. Snorting seems to increase the delirum and dissociative effects of DMT, so if you tend to freak out just start slow.<br /><br />Remember to take a break, we don&#039;t know what kind of price our noses will have to pay down the road.

				I&#039;ve heard it stings like hell but it also apparently extends the trip length and makes it more intense, so that seems like a fair trade off to me. I&#039;d like to try a large amount at least once.

				DMT Nexus will help you a lot, as will Erowid and shroomery. If you&#039;re a first timer, I recommend the tek called &quot;DMT for the Masses&quot; or &quot;Nomads tek&quot;. They&#039;re easy, quick, require basic supplies that are readily available, and is a good way to get started. If you&#039;re looking for an advanced extraction and have several years of chemistry under your belt, shoot me a message. I&#039;m a chemist with nearly a decade of hands on experience and have several higher yielding teks, but they require a large amount of chemistry knowledge.

				That should work fine, I always get bark and grind it, but I see no reason why that wouldn&#039;t work. And if you ever want to try a different tek, shoot me a message and I&#039;ll give you advice. I don&#039;t keep my synths and extractions secret or anything. But yeah, DMT for the Masses is a great place to start, and should suffice for personal DMT needs. I doubt you&#039;d ever need a better tek unless it was for selling larger amounts or if you just were interested in more complex stuff. Good luck mate.

				snorting DMT is supposed to be on par with snorting 2-CB. which at 20mg will cause you to clutch your head in pain for 20 mins. 80-120mg of DMT might make your head fall off.<br /><br />just get some MAOI&#039;s.

				As someone who&#039;s always had a bitch of a time smoking it, I will say that I tried snorting DMT once. It wasn&#039;t fun.<br /><br />I laid out 80mg, snorted ~45-50mg and ended up dumping the rest back into my jar due to the sheer pain and clogging my nostrils were getting. I didn&#039;t blast off of course. I <br />felt only mild psychedelia as well as a jingle in my head (every psychedelic has its own distinct jingle that plays in my head at times when I&#039;m on it; dunno if that&#039;s normal or not). <br />Even then the awkwardness in my nose brought me right out of it. I can&#039;t imagine someone taking in 120mg and being able to comfortably sit through hyperspace.<br /><br />Anyhow it&#039;s at least as painful as snorting mephedrone, which my dumb ass also tried once. Go ahead and do it, but you&#039;ll need both balls and a nose of steel.

				Here&#039;s my two cents on snorting DMT<br />Dosage: 2x your break through smoked dosage (for most people that&#039;s 80-120mg)<br />Burn: Before snorting it snort (or get a spray) of Lidocaine/tetracaine/benzocaine etc (or cut coke - without speed or caffeine) this will numb out your nasal cavity and prevent you from getting dragged down due to the pain.<br />also mix some of your numbing agent in with the dmt when you snort it. this way you should be able to avoid most of the pain.<br />Keep a drink handy in case you have to wash away the drip.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34015.msg603563#msg603563">Quote from: Edawg420 on November 18, 2012, 05:13 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My friend tried snorting DMT when he was all fucked up on coke...he said it was by far the worst thing he could have done....burns like hell... and mild to minor visuals....I use the volcano to vaporize my DMT....but recently i have been to scared to go =(.&nbsp; I love LSD and other slow to peak psychedelics, its just that rocket ship to the other world that scares the shit outta me.<br /><br />So for the vets out there, whats a good way to take freebase orally? just get some harmaline and take a few drops before i munch down .2 of some DMT?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>put your DMT in cola or lemon juice. this will change it to a salt instead of a freebase, stir it around really well and let it sit for a minute or two. you can also look up guides on how to make pharmahaucasca in terms of timing with taking the harmine. also understand that the trip is significantly different orally then smoked or nasally. also if you have access to Moclombimide you can skip getting harmaline and its stomach upsetting effects.<br />Also make sure you edit your diet 24 hours prior and 24 hours after taking the harmine. look up tyramine interactions.

				Traditional tobacco snuff &gt;line of dmt<br />I guess I trained the crap out of my nose by using snuff for so long, I felt slight discomfort but nothing insane, definitely not a bullet ant in my nose.. And I&#039;m a chick about 120 pounds soaking wet (so someone is a puuuuussssssaaaaaaayy&nbsp; :P)<br />Started very slow(30mg), nasal discomfort was noticeable during high so I didn&#039;t redose. Did not break through but had some interesting visuals/auditory hallucinations. Overall experience was sub-par to a decent (40-50mg) experience via vape pipe (meth pipe ::)) but this can be attributed to the low dosage

				To snort DMT you need fumerate, not freebase... trust me!<br /><br />Ask Walter on SR, he&#039;s the man yo, and he has the fumerate you&#039;re after as well as the freebase.<br /><br />Fumerate is also used for injecting and was in fact what was used in the Rick Strassman studies to accurately measure dosages for injection, then there&#039;s always taking an MAOI like syrian rue (harmaline) and ingesting a DMT cap or&nbsp; two 45 minutes later..<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br /><br />- JWM

I have had great success extracting DMT from MHRB (but good luck finding it at the moment). It is extremely easy and not very dangerous at all. I got white fluff from my first try using this tek:<br /><br />DMT20.M EXTRACTION RECIPE<br /><br />List of Ingredients &amp; Apparatus &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Ingredients.....<br /><br />1.Sodium Hydroxide i.e. Caustic Soda <br />(minimum of 5g 4 extracting 20g of mimosa hostills root bark)<br />2.Naphtha (Ronsono / Newport / Swanl Lighter Fluid 4 Zippos)<br />3. Tap water <br />4.Mimosa Hostills Root bark (20g minimum extraction)<br /><br />Apparatus.....<br /><br />1.568ml vinegar bottle (can be found @ any supermarket)<br />2.12inch Plastic Pipettes <br />3.Dust Mask <br />4.Eye goggles<br />5.Glass McCartney Jar (I use Plastic Pill Bottle)<br />6.Small Glass Baking dish <br />7.Millie-litre Measuring Jug <br />8.Filters (to carefully pour in your ingredients!)<br /><br />(All these apparatus items can be found on e bay quite cheaply) <br /><br />1.Take your glass vinegar bottle and make sure it is washed thoroughly throughout. <br /><br />2.Now Measure 200ml of tap water in your measuring jug and pour this into your vinegar bottle.<br /><br />3.Measure out 5g of Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) and filter this into your vinegar bottle containing the de Ionised water.<br /><br />(Note: It may get a little hot as the caustic soda and water mix! So once all of the caustic soda has been filtered into the vinegar bottle, give it a little swirl:) <br /><br />4.Now You have mixed the sodium hydroxide and de ionised water together, filter in approximately 20g of Mimosa Hostills Root Bark <br /><br />5.Give it a little shake (1 - 2min) <br /><br />6.Now store this solution in a dark, undisturbed part of your working area at room temperature overnight! (I use my bedroom cabinet and would store for 24hours)<br />DMT20.M EXTRACTION RECIPE<br /><br /><br />7.Now Measure out 50ml of Naphtha with your measuring Jug and then continue to add this to your vinegar bottle using one of your small filters <br /><br />(DO NOT SHAKE YET! THIS WILL PERTENTIALLY RUIN YOUR DMT) <br /><br />8.Start running a water bath for your solution @ 60c <br /><br />(You may be limited to your resources! So SWIM used a sink with the hot water tap which was filled up to the top with the hottest water it could produce. This came out to around 45c – 51c which is satisfactory) <br /><br />9.Leave your solution in your water bath for around 30-40mins.<br /><br />10.Now take your solution in your vinegar bottle and UN-crew the cap to release any pressure generated by the hot water bath.<br /><br />11.Start shaking your solution for at least a minute. <br /><br />(This is what is called &#039;&#039;The DMT Shuffle&#039;&#039; it&#039;s important to shake vigorously but not like the world will end! Shaking 2 hard 4 2 long will result in emulsions!!!) <br /><br />12.Now create a new hot water bath (same procedure as step 8) <br /><br />13.Place your solution in the hot water bath! But for 4 hours now. Running a new water bath every 2hours. <br /><br />(This separates the naphtha containing the NN-DMT to the top of the solution where it is easy to python of the naphtha and proceed onto the next step) <br /><br /><br />DMT20.M EXTRACTION RECIPE<br /><br /><br />14.Once the 4hours has passed, Take your vinegar bottle out of your water bath and UN crew the cap to release any pressure and let it cool down!<br /><br />15.Now using your pipette filter out the top layer of naphtha and store in your plastic pill bottle.<br /><br />16.Make Sure your Glass Baking is Well cleaned with hot water <br /><br />17.Pour your naphtha collected in your pill bottle into the Glass Baking Dish<br /><br />18.Now Store for 24 hours in your freezer.<br /><br />19.Take your glass dish and python off any remaining naphtha which did not freeze and now store this in your pill bottle for future extractions <br /><br />(Note: when doing a new extraction with new mimosa hostills root bark don&#039;t use old naphtha it is best to use new stuff to get maximum yield) <br /><br />Now your should be left with what looks like small golden yellowish crystals. At the bottom of your glass dish! <br /><br />20.Now leave this in a dark undisturbed place of your working area to dry for a couple of days with something to cover it on top.<br /><br />(I use a vinyl to cover top so no oxygen gets to the crystals and melts them! This will happen if you leave your crystals to dry with no cover!) <br /><br />Extracting 100g of Mimosa Hostills Root Bark will get you around 0.9g of NN-DMT (through if you can perfect the tek you can 1.5g of NN-DMT)(0.3g out of 20g)<br /><br />Peace &amp; Godspeed………<br /><br /><br />***When he mentions the hot water bath I use a crock-pot on the low setting and it works like a dream.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Then after using that you may graduate to watcha&#039;s tek for producing more amounts at a time. <br /><br /><br />-------------CLEARNET WARNING------------------------------<br /><br />https://mycotopia.net/forums/dmt-spice/58086-whatchas-easy-mhrb-stb-extraction-step-step-pictorial.html<br /><br />Good luck to any and all who attempt! And have a safe and enlightening experience in hyperspace!
