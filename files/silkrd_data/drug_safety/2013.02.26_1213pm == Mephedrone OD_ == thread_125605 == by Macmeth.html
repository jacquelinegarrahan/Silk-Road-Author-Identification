				Anyone had a similar experience. Been smoking meth for 5days and thought i would top up finnish off with a cap of mepherone, no idea how much was in it as i dont have scales but it looked much like before, was the end of the bag though. Took it and was just feeling it start to build when i became hideously nauseous, i puked twice and the colour was fuking scary as in&nbsp; red as red with bits of more solid red, had some red capsicum for dinner but only 2 small pieces. Had violent stink ass shits as well. Just a little bit freaked cause i have Cirrhosis of the liver, with no complications at this stage. One of the complications you get is spontaneous bleeding from stomach, throat, bum you name it where theres blood.<br />I know that some chems or combos of chems can also cause spontaneous bleeds. Many NSAIDS cause stomach lining to bleed every time you take them so am hoping this is the reason.<br />Think i might have just given up getting high, haven&#039;t had a drink for a year, gave it up in the moment the specialist said Cirhosis.<br />Think i might reswitch my brain to denial,&nbsp;

				That sounds horrible, I&#039;m sorry to hear your story!<br /><br />MDMA and Mephedrone both invoke serotonin increases right? And serotonin is not just a neurotransmitter, but doubles as a chemical &quot;pulse&quot; for your digestive system. It is literally the mechanism that contracts your digestive muscles from your swallowing food, to it being pushed along through your bowels. So it&#039;s not surprising taking either quickly gives you the runs. It&#039;s a bit of a laxative. <br /><br />Seeing blood in your stool however is a whole other kettle of shit. Dude. That&#039;s more than meph.. and probably more than meph and meth.. sounds like you have a preexisting condition and the drugs don&#039;t help. See a doctor and be honest with them, they are there to help. Live another day, get high again later. <br /><br />
