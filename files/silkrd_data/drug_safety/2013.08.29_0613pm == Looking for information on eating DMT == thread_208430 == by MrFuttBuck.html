				I ordered some freebase DMT and was wanting to eat it with a MAOI. Which MAOI is the most efficient with this method. How much DMT would I need to eat and any other tips would be helpful too!

				This is a complex question. Lots of different stories out there on pharmahuasca.<br /><br />The problem with the Caapi brews is that they taste like shit. Worse than shit. So bad in fact you&#039;ll struggle to not instantly puke. So Syrian Rue is preferable. But the one method I tried ended up being a waste: swished down a tablespoon&#039;s worth of Syrian Rue seeds, wait an hour then swallowed 100mg of DMT in a capsule. No effects from DMT like AT ALL.<br /><br />But this isn&#039;t the fault of the rue. It&#039;s the DMT. Getting it in your body orally from powder is challenging. Sure you can chug freebase (I hear it tastes foul too) but the problem is that most of it stays in your GI tract rather than absorbed into your bloodstream. Maybe if you do 250mg that&#039;d be enough but it sounds so wasteful.<br /><br />I could be all wrong on this but when freebase DMT powder hits your stomach the hydrochloric acid there I believe turns it into a molecule that does not easily pass through the intestinal walls. It has nothing to do with the MAOI.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about eating the seeds, or powdered seeds in gel caps, followed an hour later by plugging 100mg up my ass with a syringe but am worried it&#039;ll be a waste too.

There are also pharmacuetical MAOIs but take care. one success story I read with rue was was 4tsp of seeds boiled into a tea.

Is that they don&#039;t ingest enough MAOI for the body to stop metabolising the DMT. And the sensitivity between people varies greatly. <br /><br />The clue is in the name Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. You have to completely inhibit the activity of&nbsp; monoamine oxidase thus preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters (DMT is transported by monoamine). Sorry to say it has nothing to do with stomach acid etc. either you didn&#039;t prepare the MAOI correctly and it wasn&#039;t strong enough or you took too little to inhibit fully.<br /><br />The best way is to dose the MAOI on its own without any DMT. And find the dose that induces a psychedelic state. Take enough until you feel the effects and see light traces. <br /><br />Start at 50 grams of Caapi brew and work your way up. Once you have found the dose that gives you noticeable effects, introduce the DMT the next time around. Take a look at https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=topics&amp;f=51 [clearnet] for really good information.<br /><br />It also depends on how good your extraction and brewing method is. I have had really good results using the herbal percolator also clearnet - http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/The_Herbal_Percolator<br /><br />With only 30 grams and acidified water is enough to inhibit monoamine oxidase for me, like I said you could be completely different.<br /><br /><br />

Just ingest the freebase in orange juice maybe 10 mins after the caapi. Or just dissolve the freebase into the caapi brew right at the end of heating up.
