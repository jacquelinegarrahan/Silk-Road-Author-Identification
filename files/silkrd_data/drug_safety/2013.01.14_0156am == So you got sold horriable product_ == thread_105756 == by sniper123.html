				I&#039;m just wanting to express my frustration. So I&#039;m not going to state the name of the vendor in this thread. I received several products from the same vendor. It appears i have lung damage, possibly stomach damage, and i can&#039;t regulate temperature correctly. It&#039;s a vendor i have used several times in the past and finally bought in bulk. I know the risk i took when messing with RC&#039;s. But, based off the last batches that this was in fact the same product.<br /><br />Now, i have several friends sick and two had to receive medical treatment. Thank god they got to come home from the hospital.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to fear monger anyone into not using rc&#039;s. This is not my intention. I am just seeking advice on how i should handle this between myself and the vendor. It&#039;s hard when you have people that trusted you in agony, including yourself. Any tips would be wonderful.

				Ummm..<br /><br />If someone is selling bad chems you need to name the account and product. Chivalry doesn&#039;t really matter when you&#039;ve possibly been poisoned.

				I agree with BC here. Everyone needs to know exactly how this happened, why you think it was the drugs that made you and your friends sick, what product it was, and which vendor. We at least need to know, someone might have more information and you may be able to prevent others in the future from getting sick.

				Hello Sniper, I may be a n00by, but I could be the next one to buy from this vendor. For the sake of many people on the road, it may be more helpful in the long run to just tell people the name of the vendor.<br /><br />I am very happy that no one perished because of this, but someone might down the road if the vendor keeps sending products that make their customers sick.

				That sounds horrible.<br /><br />If you are sure it is the result of vendor malfeasance, go ahead and name the vendor.

				Wow.... Sad story! Like any nasty vendor : selling good products for testing, and when you buy high quantities, he fucks you up. Nice mentality.

				Your best bet would be to get some sort of measure to evaluate purity or dissolve adulterants.
