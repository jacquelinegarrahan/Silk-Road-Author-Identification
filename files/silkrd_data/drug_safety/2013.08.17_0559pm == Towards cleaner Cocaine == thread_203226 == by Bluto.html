				I occasionally like Cocaine but can&#039;t stand the additives that people put in it or the way that it is processed using chemicals like Kerosene.<br /><br />From Erowid (clearnet: http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/coca2cocaine.html<br />Quote<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The coca leaves are put into an above ground container or in a plastic lined pit. An alkaline material (sodium carbonate) and water are added to the leaves. Here the alkaline material enables the cocaine alkaloid present in the leaf to be extracted into the kerosene.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Step 2<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A water immiscible solvent (kerosene) is added to water, solution and leaves. The mixture is then agitated. Usually this is accomplished by having several people stomp on the leaves. The solvent acts to extract water insoluble cocaine alkaloids from the alkaline solution.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Step 3<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cocaine alkaloids and kerosene separate from the water and leaves. The water and leaves are then drained off.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Step 4<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cocaine alkaloids are extracted from the kerosene into a dilute acid solution (H2SO4). Alkaline material (sodium carbonate) is added to the remaining solution which causes a precipitate to form. The acid and the water are drained off and the precipitate is filtered and dried to produce coca paste, a chunky off-white to light brown, putty-like substance. As a guide to relative quantities of coca leaf and the resultant amount of coca paste, 250 pounds of dried coca leaf should provide approx. 2.2 pounds of coca paste. This is assuming the leaf is &quot;worked&quot; for a couple of days. The paste will contain approx. 30 percent cocaine alkaloid and 10 percent ecgonine depending on the variety and quality of the coca leaf.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Is there another way of extracting Cocaine HCL from Coca? Perhaps using ethanol or some other organic solvent that isn&#039;t Kerosene?<br /><br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t Kerosene leave traces of Heavy Metals in the Cocaine?<br /><br /><br />By the way, notice that I&#039;m not even touching cut. When a dealer cuts shit into coke -he&#039;s basically just admitting that he&#039;s ripping you off.<br /><br /><br />(ATTENTION COKE DEALERS, LET ME CUT MY OWN DRUGS. THANKYOU)<br />

				I was wondering the same thing, would one be able to use Hexane of Naphtha instead of kerosene?
