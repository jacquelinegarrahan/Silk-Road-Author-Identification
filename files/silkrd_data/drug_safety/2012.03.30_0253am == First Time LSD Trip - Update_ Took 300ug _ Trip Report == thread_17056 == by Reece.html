				i had my first trip not long ago, one hit of tonys original batch and was home alone and it was perfect.&nbsp; I listened to Armin Van Buurens a state of trance with watching tron on mute.&nbsp; I went for a walk but live in a popular city and felt anxious and the walk felt like it took forever and was very long, when it was the opposite.&nbsp; I have done mushrooms and RC many times and know to make sure I focus on what is happening to stay safe (ie make sure the door is unlocked when i leave in case i lose my keys somewhere, dont stand and stare in the middle of a neihborhood in case someone is watching and calls police,)&nbsp; its best to do it in the forest or nature but that wasnt an option for me (my balcony overlooks the city and it was a huge dance of colours) like others say, stay with really close friends who wont fuck with you or both you, try to have them be under the influence with you.&nbsp; Once you fry with someone multiple times then you can fry around them when they are sober because they know what your experiencing. Marijuana is perfect combo for it. Just give yourself plenty of time and try to disconnect with the regular world (dont want a call from a parent or something of the sorts)&nbsp; For me it lasted a full 12 hours. If you do go out where people are, make sure not to have anything illegal on you, if your under age dont drink and go out because police can fuck with you for it.&nbsp;

				Well depending on qulaity I&#039;d say two for you first time should be enough, and preferably at the same time. You need to get a feel for how pyschs change your perceptions, otherwise you will spin out of control and it will not be as enjoyable an experience. Weight shouldn&#039;t affect too much btw. And either take it by yourself in a safe, comfortable environment, or with a friend you trust (give him or her some too, it helps to be on the same wavelength). <br />Let us know how it goes, pre load with vitamins and have some nice weed handy for when you need to calm things down at 5:30 in the morning. :D<br /><br />Have fun!

				How experienced are you in psychedelics? If you&#039;re looking to go big your first time, two is a good amount. Three or four could be a bit more overwhelming. LSD is my drug of choice :) I hope you have a great time and come to understand and enjoy much more about the way things exist.

				One is good if you just wanna get your feet wet and see what it&#039;s like (not a bad idea, you can always take more next time around), otherwise two should give you a great first time.&nbsp; I&#039;d just take them at the same time.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think you get the full effect of what you take once you&#039;re already tripping.<br /><br />Otherwise, everyone has lots of good advice - and don&#039;t forget to stock up on anything you might want - cigarettes (if you smoke - make sure you have even more than you might need, you dont wanna worry about running out), some good juice, beer (if you drink - i don&#039;t recommend drinkin on acid, but it can be nice to have around, especially towards the end of the night), etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />And if you planning on listening to music, watching movies, or any other activities, i like to have stuff planned out and ready to go...once you&#039;re going good, it&#039;s easy to forget what you wanted to do...or even work a dvd player!<br /><br />i usually trip alone, get sort of anxious around other people if they&#039;re not tripping, and my friends aren&#039;t really up for it these days.&nbsp; and i can relate to what zerostate976 said about going for a walk and getting real anxious cuz there&#039;s lots of people about....but it&#039;s still worth a try - went for a nice walk on a couple hits right in the fall when the leaves were beginning to change colors...looks so much better than anything you&#039;ll see inside!

				I&#039;d recommend on stocking up on both sleep, and food ahead of time. Recall that acid tends to make you not realize you are hungry for the duration of the trip. It can also dry out your lips, so I always keep chapstick with me.

				Being well-rested is definitely a must - and I&#039;d also recommend not having any pressing obligation the next day - You don&#039;t know how long you&#039;re gonna be up, and how you&#039;ll feel the next day (I usually feel good, but still good to not have anything to do)<br /><br />Don&#039;t agree with the food though, I always like dropping on an empty stomach much better.&nbsp; Seems like when I&#039;m tripping, if I&#039;d eaten recently, I can totally feel the food going through the digestive process, which is pretty odd.&nbsp; Juice, and maybe a small protein smoothie are good to get some nutrition if you&#039;d like during the trip (you&#039;re not gonna feel like eating that&#039;s for sure)<br /><br />And personally, at the end of the night when I&#039;m coming down, I like a nice big pizza!!&nbsp; (Usually take a few hits off a bowl waitin for the delivery)&nbsp; ;D

				Thanks for posting guys!<br /><br />What kind of vitamins do I need?<br />I&#039;ll be sure to get plenty of food for the comedown and keep in mind the other things (drinks, bit of weed, ect). <br /><br />I messaged Envious and he recommended that I take three at once for the desired effect that I want. I feel that if I do that I should make sure (110%) that I&#039;m&nbsp; staying in a safe place where I won&#039;t lose anything and have someone watch me. Personally I think that I could handle a bad trip over a disappointing trip. If it turns bad, I&#039;ll be more cautious next time and start smaller (hell, I&#039;ll have 7 tabs left from this batch and probably won&#039;t take but 2 the next time) and go up. I think that it&#039;s slightly risky, yet if I prepare for it and accept that I *could* have a bad trip I will be alright!<br /><br />I still am not sure exactly what I want to do. To me, right now, watching movies or music sounds like a waste. Yet, I know for a fact that it would not be with 300ug of LSD in me and that I could probably be entertained in a plain white room. Haha. I live somewhat in a nature environment. Plenty of woods near where I live and some really nice looking places that I&#039;m sure would go great while tripping. <br /><br />Any best places or things to do on LSD?<br /><br />Again, thanks for replies!

				If you want to have some fun and have an Android/iOS phone try to play Speedx 3D. That game is so trippy and gives awesome visuals :D<br />Also, take a walk in the nature! (I love to bring my MP3 player, music + nature feels amazing)

				set and setting are of the utmost importance, as people have said. also, i&#039;d recommend meditating beforehand and thinking about all your worries/fears/etc. that could possibly come out during the trip. get them out of the way beforehand! best advice i can give is to just read the psychedelic experience and keep the phrase &quot;no resistance&quot; in your mind if you are feeling anxious. don&#039;t try to control the trip, or it will turn &quot;bad.&quot; no need to worry, your subconscious will take over. enjoy the show! i hope you find what you&#039;re looking for.

				I would recommend taking two hits. Three would be OK too, but don&#039;t go beyond that. Don&#039;t go out in public until after you&#039;ve peaked, and if it&#039;s still light outside, be sure to wear sunglasses. Eating usually isn&#039;t desirable, but do stay hydrated.

Everything I remember. I took small notes on my comedown so I would remember. It&#039;s currently around 1am at the time of this writing and 14 hours since I&#039;ve experienced the drug LSD. I took three tabs as a total dose of 300ug for my first experience. I live in an extremely small town that borders woods all around. A river is nearby.<br /><br />I first took three tabs at 11am. I was in the SR chatroom and didn&#039;t plan on taking it yet honestly. I didn&#039;t feel planned out like I should and wanted to be, yet it was around 10:46+ and closing 11pm. I wanted to do it at 11pm so I could easily track how long I had been tripping (like I thought that would matter). Right at 11am, I took three tabs I had ready (I made sure to get 3 and store the rest as I just got the product in a little while earlier). <br /><br />I knew that I would be coming up soon and planned that I would take a shower and would change before tripping as I planned on going outside. I hopped in the shower and felt nothing really. I took a long and slow shower and hoped that what I had taken had indeed been LSD as I hoped. When I got out of the shower I hopped on my phone to look up more about LSD. I&#039;ve looked up and researched a lot about the drug but decided to read some more. I believe I was reading about Albert Hoffmans bicycle ride when I randomly started laughing. For no reason I was laughing and felt an enormous joy. I still had doubts I had indeed taken something else or had tabs without LSD. This was around 45 minutes after taking the LSD.<br /><br />I go and hop back on the chat, talking to Atomos and some other guys on there [thanks for being there &lt;3] and say &quot;yeah, laughing uncontrollably, I still feel it&#039;s a placebo though&quot;. So then Atomos sends me a link to (Future Sound Of London - Cascade). I melt away into the shapes and feel as though I may actually be inside my brain or looking at a brain. I knew at this time I was under the effect of LSD. About one hour in. I may have watched another video, yet it didn&#039;t stick with me. I decided then I would take a walk. <br /><br />I went to walk one way on my way to what was back in the woods. I had an unusual feeling in my stomach and started laughing uncontrollably now. I&#039;m still on the sidewalk at this point. For some reason unknown to me, I decide to turn around and go the opposite way. I find myself going across a schoolyard. I feel happy and cheerful, birds are chirping yet I pay no attention to them. I really take notice of my own steps though. A tired feeling comes over me, yet it&#039;s as though I cannot stop walking.. I have to continue on. Crossing the school yard, there is a tree (purple flowers blooming from it I believe). It was an amazing looking tree to me. Another was beside it and closer, but I had to get to this tree. I finally got to it and observed it. Turning opposite from the school, and away from the school, I seen a place that seemed almost unfamiliar with me at the time. It was as though I didn&#039;t know where I was, yet I did. I had not completely lost where I was at this point. I went on down the road after finding a point I knew well.<br /><br />I came to a spot where birds seemed everywhere. It was the most peaceful part of my trip I believe. I walked down the road (no cars come on these small little streets) with these birds for a while. Rippling effects were slight, yet evident. I continued. I was on my way to reach a trainbridge that went over a river. I figured seeing the river would be amazing. It really wasn&#039;t. On my way there, a truck was pulling out of his driveway and I stood and watched. I felt a slight paranoia as I felt the person in the car knew I was on something. It was as if I was keeping my trip a secret. I waited for them to leave before I continued. Right near the bridge there were dogs, I didn&#039;t really like them and tried to avoid them. Yet the easiest way to get to the bridge was beside them. I crossed a spot of high grass. I remember being very worried that crossing the grass there would be a snake. Lucky for me there wasn&#039;t. I got to the bridge. The bridge was covered in black tar and I started to walk across. This just seemed bad and I was somewhat unconfortable at this point. I was trying to dabble at some abstract thought while hopping on this bridge, yet I cannot make heads or tails of what. About 3/4 across the bridge I run up on a spot between two boards where wasps are coming out. I see them and are scared to death. It feels as though my heart stops. I try to remain calm and turn around. From the top of the bridge I look to see the water. Green and looks about the same, I am unimpressed by it. I want to go back to the birds. I wonder back to right where they were. I figure this is the point where I hit peak. It was between 12:36-12:42 that time stopped for me. I felt everything in the world turn to quiet and the world seems frozen in time. Yet it isn&#039;t a cold frozen, it isn&#039;t empty. It&#039;s full. Everything stops. I know this because I pull out my phone to verify. Haha. It was either 12:36 or 12:42 but it never moved. I checked it what seemed like 4 times and it said the same thing. I felt like I could do whatever I wanted. This ended, and I stumbled to the end of the street. The place looked brand new to me, I was completely somewhere else until I reached right on the main street. Coming up to it from the smaller street I had no idea where I was. Finding where I was, I wanted to go back home, it was getting hot and all. <br /><br />I come in. I lay on the couch and look at the drapes by the windows. They become 3D figures and flatten, then branch out and connect with the wall as if they are one. They seem to live together and intertwine. Like veins going through your skin. The veins are in the drapes/curtains and go throughout. I am messmorized. Not sure when but at times during this I checked out myself in the mirror. My eyes looked like green marbles and were the most amazing things I think I had ever seen. They were a light emerald (yet they actually are blue) and seemed to have a shine to them that was amazing. I find myself hungry, as I now hadn&#039;t eaten since the morning. I go to the kitchen only to find a banana. I try to eat it whole and eventually eat it. I now discover that my mouth is numb. I go to the other room and get on the computer. I find myself to YouTube and onto Nickelback. I watch the video (Nickelback- When We Stand Together) and not only feel like I&#039;m with the band, but feel a massive want to help people. I feel as if our government just.. isn&#039;t right, in about the simplified form possible. I feel as though we as people need to help as the government and &quot;others&quot; haven&#039;t. I ponder life and probably some other thoughts in an abstract manner. Moving on the next and probably the craziest video is (Nickelback - How You Remind Me). Having no idea what happened in the video I become the character that Chad (lead guitarist and vocalist of Nickelback) that is being portrayed in the video. With the colors I change emotions. I feel as though the woman left me and I am alone through most of the video. She is always there though. She is beautfiul in her own way. A sexiness that I don&#039;t think anyone else could have. Color fades in and out, changing my emotions. I loved at 2:50 pushing her away. I felt better than her. I felt better than the people in my life that didn&#039;t want me before but now did. I accepted this inside me that the people that want me now I am better than if they did not want me before. I can be alright without them.<br /><br />I then watch (Madeon - Pop Culture) and have a mini-rave/disco [dance!] inside my head. I watch (Science Saved My Soul.) and got bored halfway through it. I skipped to the end and listened to it while I felt like I was tripping through space. I decided I honestly wanted to go back outside. By now it&#039;s nearing 2pm (three hours after the trip). I walk out and hear construction going on somewhere away. I feel like I am miniscule at this point. I feel like everything around me isn&#039;t real and that I am seeing the real, somewhat comparable to a Matrix world filled with machines. Pondering this fact I stumble back and fourth aimlessly. I sit on the sidewalk and think more. I go to cross the street and a car drives by behind me. Someone, who I assume is a good friend of mine (yet I haven&#039;t met him to validate this), yelled something to me. I think I remember him saying &quot;I told you so&quot;. Yet, he probably didn&#039;t say this. Yet, I pondered the &quot;I told you so&quot; and thought he was somehow talking about my trip. <br /><br />Wondering back across the street and around a building, a bird jumps out from it&#039;s nest. It seemed like no ordinary bird, a miniature pterodactyl with a full screech. I am unbelievably scared at this point and jump. I keep walking and find myself to another build. Knowing it&#039;s near 3pm now I call a friend and want to go somewhere else. It&#039;s hot here and wanted to do something away from my house. I wander to both sides of a building, laying down on the concrete beside them. Going in and out of abstract thought. At one point, I closed my eyes, and then opened to see a car going by. It was as if the car was stopped though, yet it moved past me. Quite a weird experience. <br /><br />Going to the other side, I talk to my friend on the phone while she comes to get me. I laugh uncontrollably and play with flowers at this point. I&#039;m bored crazy and feel paranoid with cars driving by.<br /><br />Before she gets to pick me up I go for another small walk, I walk back to the school and come to the beginning of a schoolyard. A car goes bye and an elderly woman goes by. It&#039;s as if I had seen this woman many times. She had on sunglasses and had very grey hair, probably in her 70&#039;s. She drives by me slow and stairs. Continuing up the street I watch her car, it&#039;s as if she takes her hand off the wheel and turns right around at me. I am very paranoid at this point. She even turns and takes a right, as if turning around to come back to me. I start walking fast in the opposite direction and go to my house. Even as I trip, I am able to keep somewhat straight thoughts and gather together my money and keys and place them somewhere I wouldn&#039;t lose them before leaving with my friend.<br /><br />We ride in my friends car until we reach her house. I look in her mirros to find that my eyes are now a bright sky blue. It&#039;s 3:30-4:15 now and I feel like I&#039;ve hit my peak and am coming down. I go in her room filled with colors and no longer really see anything. She goes to take a shower. I feel a burning in the back right of my head, it hurts quite a bit but I reassured myself I would be alright. I lay there and look at her walls. They have random paints spots (such as blue) of spray paint against her pink walls. One in particular reached another and I could see green. The colors ran into each other and I could feel them moving. I could see them moving. Around here I find some sort of solid &quot;sweat&quot; on the wall and can actually wipe it off. Somewhat amusing, not sure what it was but it was clear and small against the wall. She was gone forever in the shower. Her ceiling fan was on. Here I reach a very abstract thought that I will try to explain to the best of my ability. Each time the fan spins it casts shadows on the walls, I think everyone knows this. Yet, I felt as though I could slow down the fan and actually be inside a time within the shadow. Each shadow being show against the wall was a point in time that I could feel. A hard concept to explain indeed.<br /><br />I lay back and see waves formed on the ceiling by the fan. It becomes green and the ceiling is moving.<br /><br />It&#039;s now around 4pm-5pm and I am actually coming down from the trip I believe. I continued to eat, go out with my friend, talk, and go out to a sports bar. All of the time my senses seem distorted almost. I feel a slight disconfort in the back of my head where it was burning earlier still. It&#039;s now almost 2am when I finish this report. A good 15 hours after taking this magnificent drug. I plan on using it for many uses in the future. :) <br /><br />This was first was to get my feet wet and experience the drug known as LSD. Next I plan to actually use it to.. you&#039;ll see. <br />Rather not spoil it. ;)<br /><br />I know there are spelling errors. Please try to read with them.

				Sounds like a good adventure Reece, I wasn&#039;t able to control myself near as well on 300mics. We had to have a sober friend come over and help us order food D:

				Hi people. Must respond to this post because I found humor. We eat acid. Lots of it. At least twice a week. Don&#039;t worry about the dosage my friend. As long as it&#039;s good A then eat 2-4 for a nice time. If your heavy then dose a ten strip. I agree with the above that a 1/4 mg. of MDMA potentates the trip, however, if you want something special I recommend a few hits of NO2.&nbsp; Step on my trip. You&#039;ll peak fast.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />DiMiTri

				Thanks for the report Reece! Glad to see you had a great time! :)<br /><br />Reading your report has really got me wanting to drop some acid again. It&#039;s been 4-5 years, and I think a few of the friends I did it with last time will be more than happy to get together and experience this again =D

I think it would be fun to be in a group and have an LSD experience. If you do in fact decide to, please post up a trip report!

I love music very much in general, but listening this songs on LSD was just like hearing the music for the first time in my life. Overwhelming.<br />Sex on that LSD-trip was also just fantastic.
