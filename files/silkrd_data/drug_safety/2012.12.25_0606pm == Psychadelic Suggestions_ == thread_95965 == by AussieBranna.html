				&#039;ello travelers! Looking for someone well experienced in psychs to give me some recommendations. I don&#039;t really know much about anything other than shrooms and LSD, and am only experienced with the former. If anyone can point me to a basic thread for newer users or drug experiences, that&#039;d be great. I&#039;m trying to use the search function but I keep getting an error message ??

				I have extensive experience with many psychedelics, and my ultimate all-time favorite hands-down at any dose (high or low) is 2c-e.<br /><br />This baby is beautiful at high doses, forgiving to the novice/fragile tripper, powerful for the experienced tripper, perfect trippy touch at low doses for an MDMA experience or an evening out. 1-2 grams of this is perfect to last you a long time and keep the good times rolling. <br /><br />Literally, this one sometimes feels so good you might suspect someone put MDMA in it :)

				Im a lot more partial to 2cb myself. The only reason being is that whenever I take 2ce it gives me weird tension in my legs, as well as an uncomfortable body load.<br /><br /><br />anyone else experience anything similar to this?

				Sorry, clarification needed!<br /><br />I meant to say you can buy 1-2 grams of 2c-e and it&#039;ll last you for many many experiences to come. That is to say it&#039;s like investing in a sheet or two of LSD :)<br /><br />I find that the 2c-e bodyload is mitigated by chewing fresh ginger after dosing as well as during the comeup or smoking a very small amount of marijuana. Also, the more one uses 2c-e the less it causes the discomfort. It also has everything to do with mindset. I&#039;ve been able to avoid feeling sick completely just by having a positive mindset and relaxing during the comeup period.

				i&#039;d suggest starting out with the classics... lsd and psilocybin mushrooms. if you have control over your mind and want to be in the driver&#039;s seat, start out with lsd. if, on the other hand, you&#039;d prefer some guidance, i&#039;d suggest starting out with mushrooms. it all depends on what you&#039;re looking for really. just be sure to take a low dose at first. diving right in to the psychedelic experience can be a real shock. it&#039;s better to start out low and work your way up. also, here is some reading to help you on your journey: http://deoxy.org/psyexp.htm :D

Getting impatient waiting for my monthly speed &quot;prescription&quot;, I saw I had enough BTC for a 1 tablet sample of something referred to as &quot;speakers&quot;. One of those home made tablets that I believe are/were also called ecstasy - I know there should be an &quot;X&quot; in there, but I&#039;m the son of an English teacher. <br />Speaking of which the word is Psychedelic. - There&#039;s no &quot;A&quot; in the word. Just think of your &quot;psyche&quot; - Damn Grammar Nazi she was !!! Now look at me! I&#039;m a wreck! My friends call me &quot;Mr Correctol&quot; - he makes you want to shit! (Correctol being a laxative sold here in the states). <br /><br />Sorry for that mildly humorous aside. - Back to the topic. Those &quot;speakers&quot; pills, I took 1/4 after a night of heavy drinking and ran out of speed, also had Dalmane and other benzos in me. Well it did nothing, but I woke up with a very happy feeling. So later that morning I took the 3/4 left, and it started. Super cold extremities, like my feet and hands were cold and almost dripping with sweat. Armpits too. That faded fast, and I was trying to watch TV with my 16 year old daughter, and the more I commented, and heard my comments, the more I realized, I&#039;d better go to my room. <br /><br />I thought, &quot;here we go!&quot; Like when you get on a roller coaster, and you&#039;re at that pinnacle where the car is slowly getting closer to free-fall!&nbsp; Next thing I knew, I was laying in bed, listing to &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; by The Rolling Stones.&nbsp; It was their attempt at Sgt Pepper, though panned by critics at the time, it&#039;s now a classic. You can tell they were on some goooood SYD !!!!<br /><br />I never got any higher, which was OK by me, because I&#039;m 50, and haven&#039;t tripped since 1985 at a Johnny Thunders concert in NYC. Went to the top of the World Trade Center, since we were both afraid of heights. We had strong acid back then. The last two batches we did that were so strong, we really felt we never had to trip again, because we both think we never quite came down, were Red Windowpane, and before that, a blotter that was a big fat greenish-blue drop on a tab. The drop was almost the size of an American dime. They were so strong, that their name was &quot;Half moons&quot; - They were sold as half blotter hits, because of the strength. That night we did two Full Moons! - Walls bending and flowing like curtains, then someone startles you and says &quot;HEY&quot;, and you look at them, and the hallucinations are gone for now. That night, after riding the train home. I sneaked quietly into my house at 4 am, and when I got into my bedroom, sat on the bed, saw the walls start to blow like curtains, I turned out the light, and instantly was in a Yellow Submarine cartoon hallucination. Un-fucking believeable!!!<br /><br />The next day, when I saw my friend, the first thing he said was. &quot;I think we gotta cut back for a while&quot;. We talked all day long, and decided &quot;No more tripping for a while&quot;, and we never did again, before you knew it, we were too busy working, making families, Johnny died, then Kurt, our guitar heroes!&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Born again punk rock druggie at 50! He and I live 10 mins from each other, both divorced, both have custody of our kids. We both married women who went batshit crazy at 48! - Hey! It happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;So here we are again, the start of the end, but there&#039;s more!&quot; - Todd Rundgren &#039;International Feel&#039; from A Wizard A True Star&nbsp; album (fyi)<br /><br />PS Did I make a point in all of that? I think I just had a contact high! Just talking about it, makes me feel it a little. - and oh yeah, what do people mean by &quot;body load&quot;. I can&#039;t grasp that one. <br />

It was great, but to be honest it scares me too much. So need to slow it down by ingesting it as a traditional brew. So I backed off DMT and started exploring with LSD, mushrooms some of the the 2C&#039;s. After this route I would probably say, start with mushrooms and LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dose low and work up to what you are comfortable with, then find out what you are looking for. Do you what to have life changing experiences or just trip? Some substances can be used in different ways. 2C-B has less of a mind space than LSD but similar visuals. But then dosing is critical, and you can address issues on 2C-B. Basically different drugs have different effects. Only by slowly exploring will you find the right one for you. <br /><br />Read lots of trip reports, note the dose that people have taken. Read the bad trip reports and notice why it happened. Did they take too much? Had different drug combinations, set and setting was poor etc. Get a feel for the effects before you take a substance for the first time.<br /><br />Taking any psychedelic you want to practice some basic harm reduction.<br /><br />1. Make sure your mind set and setting is excellent. Take it in a comfortable place where risks are minimal. <br />2. Make sure you know the length of the trip and can devote the time to take the drug.<br />3. Have a sober sitter, or experienced tripper with you. Or on the end of a speed dial, who won&#039;t judge and won&#039;t call the police, hospital, or parents on impulse.<br />4. Have a benzo on hand just in case you need to bomb out. One trip report that I read, the writer&#039;s cat died mid LSD trip. You don&#039;t want to be dealing with shit like that on acid.<br />5. If you decide to trip with a friend. Make sure that person your best friend in the world. The one that if you told them a dark secret they would understand. It&#039;s no fun tripping with people you don&#039;t really know.<br />6. Eat well, exercise and stay healthy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Go check out https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/ [clearnet] great information and trip reports for different entheogens.

				I am really excited for this topic as I am in the same boat. Only shrooms and LSD for me, but I am curious about others. LSD is my drug of choice, and I don&#039;t care much for mushrooms. I don&#039;t like the speediness and nausea, plus mushrooms in general are disgusting little pieces of shit that make me gag uncontrollably. I&#039;ve been trying to do some research on Errowid, but some of those trip reports are ridiculously long and wordy. I just want someone to say &quot;Good: blah blah blah, Bad: blah blah blah&quot;. That said, how&#039;s everyone feel about Miprocin? I&#039;m thinking that might be my next adventure because it seems pretty light but still gives visuals. I think visuals are one of my favorite side effects of tripping.

				if i was to give my completely honest recomendation based on experience, id say stay away from the 2cs (just my opinion, dont hate!) lsd and psilocybin have this god like magic to them. so does dmt but its an intense ride if done properly.<br />ive been told that 2c-p connects you to the gaian mind like the classics do, but i just dont trust them. ive done some 2cs, Dos, and( 25b, 25c,25i-nbome) i personally feel like the phenethylamines are fun and might be able to provide an intense trip but for me they just havent been studied enough, nor do they provide the profound experiences the indole psychedelics do. i DO know that the phenethylamines dont work in the same way the trypts do, and thats why youll have a tendancy to feel depleted the day after. they arent mimicing serotonin like the tryptamines do and its obvious because suicide tuesdays occur on pheneths. if i had to go back in time and do it all over, i wouldnt have taken the phenethylamines and i truly mean that. ive learned things on them but its not worth the mystery of the substances themselves IMO

Bad comedowns and &quot;suicide tuesdays&quot; occur with alpha-methylphenethylamines (amphetamines). Those are SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) and DRAs (dopamine releasing agents) which bind to SERT (serotonin transporter) and DAT (dopamine transporter), reversing their direction of flow and depleting serotonin and dopamine, unlike 2Cs, tryptamines and LSD which bind to the receptor directly.

				i know nbomes arent 2c-x chemicals thats not the message i was trying to portray. ive done every family of pheneths but i havent taken every single substance. but i put &quot;dont hate&quot; in parenthesis for exactly this reason, i dont want anyone to think im downing those substances but from my perspective they seem damaging. but you really think phenethylamines mimic serotonin? i have not done research into how phenethylamines act in the brain but to say that they mimic serotonin seems off to me.... thats like trying to put the wrong key into your door.... if you look at serotonin and you look at any random pheneth you would never think that the pheneth causes serotonin to be released... i would assume all pheneths work like amphetamines, by blocking the reuptake of those chemicals so your basically &quot;flooding&quot; your brain with them.. i know certain specific dopamine receptors (when activated) cause serotonin release along with it, and im pretty sure it can go the other way around. (certain serotonin sights, upon being activated, will cause residual dopamine release)<br />either way im not trying to force any opinion on anyone im simply supplying mine :D. its really ironic that you commented right after me though ballzinator, YOU are the one who informed me of the magic of 2c-p (which i have yet to try knowingly)<br />if you could give me some clearnet links that explain phenethylamine psychedelics in the brain please post them! we&#039;ve got to educate ourselves no doubt!

				I&#039;ve been experimenting with psychedelics for a very long time.<br /><br />The most obvious one is cannabis. If you have a low tolerance to it, it can be a VERY strong psychedelic for some people. It always has been for me, I used to get visuals off of it. Also in my opinion, cannabis synergizes quite well with mushrooms, LSD, and (most) other psychedelics.<br /><br />Mushrooms and Cacti (Mescaline) are probably my 2 most favorite psychedelics. Cacti is so soothing and forgiving, it&#039;s hard to have a bad trip on it. Mushrooms have the potential to be much harsher, but also stunningly beautiful. If you want to go really deep, smoking DMT whilst tripping on pretty much any psychedelic is fucking AMAZING and will take you to new heights you never even thought were imaginable. One of my best DMT trips was while I was on mushrooms, I was filled with ancient ephemeral power that rocked me to the core.<br /><br />Personally I am not a fan of most RC&#039;s. But there are some diamonds in the rough. Of the 2C series my favorite was 2cb, there was much less potential for a mind-fuck overload but still incredible visuals and high. 2C-E simply took me too far way too fast, and there was a high potential for freaking out on it. Never did try 2C-I. As for 2c-p I&#039;ve read some negative reports on it and it sounds like it just lasts waaay too long and would be uncomfortable.<br /><br />As for the NBomes, I think they are a waste of time compared to real legit LSD which unfortunately is a rarity these days. Not that there isn&#039;t any benefit to be gained from them, I&#039;d rather take an NBome over some shitty DOx any day but I think they both suck compared to the earthly goddess that is Lucy. It really is a shame that most of the acid on here is overpriced ($200 for a ten-strip?!?!?! You gotta be jokin&#039;!!!) The acid market is so fuckin&#039; flooded with fake shit it really sucks. My advice to the acid heads is look for un-perf White on White and try to get it from someone who isn&#039;t just some fool trying to make money, get it from someone who believes in the experience. My best acid trips were ALWAYS from un-perf WoW, that shit is unbelievable.<br /><br />And finally of course there is MDMA. Oh beautiful Molly, thank you for all the good times. Molly synergizes incredibly well with mushrooms, infact the hippyflip is one of my favorite combos of all time. At festivals I often find myself in heaven on this combo. I find the molly opens you up more and allows the mushroom to better perform it&#039;s work on you. Smoke DMT at the peak for the ultimate experience. MDA is really awesome as well, some like it better since it is a bit stronger.<br /><br />DMT is wonderful and can change people&#039;s lives/perspectives, permanently. I have seen it happen. It&#039;s also probably the scariest of all the psychedelics. But I highly suggest extracting your own, or getting it from someone you know well &amp; trust. The trip DMT produces can be changed by the energy of the person who made it and what their intentions are. You don&#039;t want to smoke DMT made by someone who has negative intentions or is super greedy, trust me.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents. :)

				good links, ive not really looked into pheneths too much but from what it says they are simply agonists, just like the indoles. wikipedia isnt the best source but theres still some good info there. ive just always had strange unhealthy feelings on them so i guess its a personal bias i should remove. but i really do tend to feel poisoned after ingesting a pheneth. like its something that im not supposed to put in my body in a way. i recall every single pheneth experience as having a moment of feeling like i have ingested poison.<br />and mescaline is coincidentally the most dangerous natural psychedelic we have, and the only pheneth i know of.<br />i remember hearing something like 20 times the effective dose of mescaline can kill you.... that type of shit just freaks me out....<br />you can eat hundreds of times more than the effective dose of psilocybin/psilocin and lsd, and expect to make it through the experience alive. (although im sure you would be certain you were knocking on deaths door)<br />but the last question is, why do phenethylamines cause suicide tuesdays? i feel amazing the day after psilocybin. not depleted in the slightest, or so it seems.<br />days after nbomes i&#039;m unnaturally quiet and unsocial... doesnt add up to me..<br />

				Hi Aussie,<br /><br />Having taken psychedelics for more than 20 years, I rarely &quot;trip&quot; anymore but I thought I would offer a few suggestions:<br /><br />1 If you continue to take LSD, make sure it is good and clean. Haven ingested too much cheap &quot;blotter&quot;, I can report that I suffer permanent negative effects. My vision&nbsp; often has a static-like quality, and I sometimes experience periods of confusion I know are related to my former heavy usage.<br />2. All chemical psychedelics can have negative side effects as one is coming down. The level of drug in the bloodstream and how quickly it is eliminated by the body varies by individual. I have experienced severe muscle aches, bruxism, nausea. etc. along with severe depression and anxiety. <br />3. Although I have seen other opinions expressed, I still hold that psilocybin (sp?) is the best, obviously most natural psychedelic.&nbsp; It always produces a great physical high for me, completely gets rid of my anxiety and repressions and just relaxes me. <br />4. I want to second FlyingHigh above; the mood you are in before you ingest the drug and the environment in which you experience it are critical. If you are experiencing any sort of negative emotion, it will by magnified. Do not trip alone, if you can help it. Do keep a benzodiazipene on hand if necessary; I&#039;ve seen too many people unable to handle the trip they were on and resort to actions from drinking themselves into a coma to being forced to go to a hospital.<br /><br />chinacat39

				Honestly, I was in the same boat as you not long ago (only tried LSD, mushrooms, and DMT in terms of hallucinogens), then i tried 25i-nbome (aka 2ci-nbome). I loved it. It&#039;s like LSD, but a decently shorter duration (maybe more like 6-8 hours) and with really crazy interesting visuals. It also seemed to put me in a negative head space a lot less often than acid (not to say I don&#039;t like acid, I just mean I had a lot easier of a time not stressing about problems in my life while on 25i than LSD). Furthermore, its INCREDIBLY cheap, you can get a 10 strip (you&#039;ll only need a few tabs to trip hard) for like $10-15. <br /><br />The only real drawback is it has a crazy tolerance curve - you have to wait AT LEAST a few weeks between trips if you don&#039;t want to take a lot more for the same effects, but all things considered, its a GREAT psychedelic and due to its cheap price, there&#039;s little reason not to pick some up.

				2C-B is pretty forgiving and has a seriously gentle comedown. Not to mention the visuals are awesome and it doesn&#039;t last too long. It has an MDMA kind of buzz to it as well, I love it. Best advice is to snort it as well but prepare for some serious burn. I&#039;d go as far as to say I could ingest 35mg of 2C-B and not feel the buzz I do from snorting 15mg but that&#039;s just me. Also, try and get in on some mescaline and then give me a shout to let me know if it&#039;s any good so I can buy it. I know Mahakala (spelling?) has some synthetic mescaline in stock but I&#039;m yet to see a trip report on the stuff so I&#039;m a little wary about buying it despite their stellar reputation. It&#039;s still cheaper than extracting it yourself though so it&#039;s priced nicely.<br /><br />Funnily enough Mahakala does 100mg of 2C-B for 1Btc so you could get a sample some of that on the cheap. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be disappointed. Try and stay away from the pressed and capped 2C-B pills as they represent awful value for money.<br /><br />25i-NBOMe is another drug that gets rave reviews for the visuals but I&#039;ve been told it lacks the introspection of LSD or mushrooms. Vendor TylerDurden (I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a number in his name somewhere) gets good reviews for solidly laid blotters and he has a fine selection to choose from. Really cheap as well so you can stock up on those easier than you could with LSD if price is a factor.<br /><br />Also, get a mg scale if haven&#039;t got one already. There&#039;s some proper cheap ones on eBay like the Gemini that gets decent feedback or try the scale they sell at www.buyresearchchemicals.com. It&#039;s hard to catch them when it&#039;s in stock because it sells out so quickly but I know from past experience that they are a solid scale and cheap as well. That being said I wouldn&#039;t trust any cheap scale to give me an accurate reading below 10mg. If you&#039;re looking to weigh out some NBOMe&#039;s I&#039;d suggest volumetric dosing if you can&#039;t get a good scale or like I said earlier, slide over to TylerDurden and get the pre-laid blotters.<br /><br />If you&#039;re really hard up and just want to fuck up your existence for a day get your hands on some Benadryl and knock back 500/600mg. Although it&#039;s a deleriant and not a psychaedelic from what I can gather you will see some fucked up shit anyway but it might scare the crap out of you.<br /><br />I wish you all the best in your travels friend, just don&#039;t forget the trip reports : )<br /><br />

				A lot of people find mushrooms to be &quot;gentler&quot; or more &quot;organic&quot; than LSD, though they are still plenty powerful drugs in moderate or high doses and the trip is similar, so I&#039;m not sure if this is just a subjective placebo-type experience or nott--e.g. people who think that LSD is more &quot;chemically&quot; have a different mindset when they trip and then end up having a more &quot;chemically&quot; trip, too.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;m not experienced in any of the more esoteric psychadelics, so I&#039;m finding this all pretty interesting.

Eating a piece of plant/fungus will bring a more natural trip than eating powders/paper.<br /><br />Every psychedelic is very spiritual and there is no way to avoid this.

San Pedro.&nbsp; Peyote. i think its important to learn about the purge, learn about body load early on the road.

				Thanks, Valakki, and thank, Moonflower, for helping to expand and clarify what I was getting at. I agree--psychadelics for me are laregly a spiritual tool. Obviously, there&#039;s no harm in enjoying the experience, too, but I don&#039;t see these substances as serving the same role as a lot of other drugs out there.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;d add that Mescaline is also a classic for a reason, and another good choice for early in the process of trying other things. For me, there&#039;s a lot of &quot;body&quot; to that trip, too, as with shrooms. Sort of a warm glow. Very nice.

I always went in with the mindset of taking valuable information out of it that i can integrate into my daily life and become a better person because of it. i just recently tried my 2nd &quot;rc&quot; tryptamine and im slowly coming to the conclusion that its the tryptamines, and the ability to activate the 5ht1a recepter that causes the god-like &quot;magic&quot; they have.<br /><br />(here is a david nichols video to support that information, i dont want anyone to think im talking out of my ass)<br />*clearnet*<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJtdZUy1LYE<br />(about 13:00 minutes in is what im talking about)<br />he talks about what every class of psychedelics activates in the brain and its extremely valuable information. <br /><br />the lessons i learn on tryptamines are just different than the ones ive learned on phenethylamines. i definitely almost always learn something but with phenethylamines its always a type of social lesson.... how people use their energy in conversations and how dominance takes place without it ever being apparent.. its wild shit.<br /><br />at electric forest i was tripping on an nbome and i came to the conclusion that <br />&quot; so many conversations are just ego-filled information battles, in which both sides ignore the others opinions and try to prove their own.&quot;<br /><br />and since then ive had that thought reinforced by people like robert anton wilson who states that every person has a reality tunnel. and the only way you will receive information from another man is if it fits into your views of the world. if its not a thought you&#039;ve stumbled upon yourself it seems insignificant and people tend to take it lightly.<br />but my main point is that phenethylamines have always just had an aspect of &quot;people watching&quot; to them in a way almost always a social lesson....<br /><br />tryptamines are more for exploring the depths of mind for me, as well as giving me a sense of connection to all life and &quot;god&quot; whatever that may be.<br />the miprocin(4-ho-mipt) i just purchased introduced me to dark aspects of my shadow that have never been brought to light. but it did it in a way that was caring and loving. it was nothing but positive energy towards self improvement, and idk... just sort of reinforces my thoughts that the tryptamines really are the loving teachers... the nudge in the right direction. <br /><br />again i just want to say, these are opinions!&nbsp; &nbsp;8)
