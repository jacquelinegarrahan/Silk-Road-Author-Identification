				if you&#039;ve tried all the psychedelics out there try buying some speed/meth and staying up for 4-5 days - it&#039;s by far the most intense trip i&#039;ve ever been on and i&#039;ve done most of the psychedelics around.

Like a veil has been lifted from your eyes and a massive secret revealed to you. Incredibly insightfull and beautiful, short-acting psychedelic. <br /><br />My personal favourite.<br /><br />:)

If you have an efficient way of vaporizing the DMT, then you need about 20-40mg for a breakthrough dose. Smoking, I would say double that, for a threshold breakthrough dose.<br /><br />Just so you know, you will most likely not breakthrough your first, second, and possibly even third or more times doing DMT, especially if you&#039;re smoking it. It will take you a few attempts before you even begin to get your technique down.<br /><br />Also, even if you&#039;re experienced with strong doses of mushrooms, LSD, and various other psychedelic substances, nothing can prepare you for a true breakthrough dose. To say you have massive OEVs/CEVs is a complete understatement. Each and every time I&#039;ve attempted to breakthrough, even unsuccessfully, the visuals were actually very minimal. What was overwhelming, was the extreme awareness I had of otherworldly entities watching and studying me. When you finally breakthrough, you&#039;re able to fully meet these re-materializing, all knowing entities, which a completely mind blowing, reality dissolving, unbelievably surreal experience in itself. Language is a barrier when attempting to describe the experience in words. But when you breakthrough, you will know.

				5-MeO-DMT from the toad&#039;s glands is by far the most amazing DMT out there.<br /><br />Although very different, huge bong hits of Salvia in top strength extract will produce extreme hallucinations as well.<br /><br />25i-Nbome is an excellent alternative to the expensive and elusive LSD, very similar affects with feeling of euphoria like MDA and it does not last as long as acid so you can go back to your normal day after lol.<br /><br />As for mushrooms, the best visual hallucinations will come from azurescens.<br /><br />The mushroom cyanescens is also very strong, otherwise the species related to semilanceata are all very visual!

				I am looking into pharmahuasca right now. He doesn&#039;t say how much DMT is in it but says its enough to break through. Anybody ever have to take 2 to get there? It will also be my first DMT experience so of course I will start with one. I have been looking forward too and researching DMT for a couple years now but it doesnt just fall into my lap like other things. Never heard of DMT randomly showing up at a house party, ya know? Maybe I just go to the wrong parties though.

I dont like the idea of smoking DMT because of the horrible taste, I dont like to start my trips with a chemical feeling. It ruins the natural feeling of the whole experience, thats why I only ever tried acid once.

You should experience something similar to an acid trip; colours going more intense, patterns moving and changing shapes, mild hallucinations in your vision.. Sit still, don&#039;t try to walk, and it will be done in 10 minutes or so.<br />If you got most of the hit, you may also get a bit sweaty and feel slightly faint. Not overly pleasant. You also need to get used to the taste of the smoke since it is very very harsh.<br /><br />You can also sprinkle a small dose on some sativa weed for a fun high. Both of those will help get your mind used to the idea of a full DMT trip.<br /><br />Anyone else ever tried smoking DMT while at the peak of an acid trip?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can&#039;t think of a better time to try than bicycle day coming up. I&#039;ve got two tabs saved for that day and just got a gram of DMT from Moon Unit this morning. The only trouble is I get too distracted to keep up with my trip reports that they never get finished. I&#039;ll try my best though.&nbsp; :P

				IME<br /><br />Psychadelics can be divided between man-made and natural<br /><br />so man made would include: LSD, all the &#039;2C&#039; family, ketamine<br /><br />natural: shrooms, LSA, DMT, Mescal etc.<br /><br />IMO you are less likely to freak out on natural substances because they contain certain alkaloids that facilitate a good trip. However, if you DO have a bad one it is worse on the naturals then the man made.<br /><br />Naturals mix badly with man made drugs - you see, LSD and MDMA is a classic combo but MDMA and shrooms is not great.<br /><br />As to what is stronger its the wrong question. It&#039;s like you taking 5 of your best friends and asking the question: who has the &#039;most&#039; personality. It doesn&#039;t make sense. Same with psychadelics they are each unique and incomparable in their own way. If you want to trip balls just take more - combine them if you want. <br /><br />To be safe, its best to try them all in small amount and see which one works best for you.
