				<br />If you eat a balanced and healthy diet with plenty of fiber and antioxidants , you have nothing to worry about , still there&#039;s&nbsp; no harm trying out the supplements you mentioned to see if they benefit you .<br /><br />If your vaping , your getting much fewer toxins then from smoking&nbsp; - the biggest health concern with weed is the fact that most people eat junk food when they get the munchies !<br /><br />This might sound stupid , but if your eating high fat / salty processed food in massive amounts each day - you quickly put yourself at risk .<br /><br />

				My friends and I smoke slowly, all day every day. I probably smoke 3-5 bowls daily just myself. We just take a nifty regimen of vitamins, eat well, and we have no issues at all. When I go sober for a bit, I enjoy it cause it&#039;s new again, like a different high. I haven&#039;t been doing this too long consistently but my friend&#039;s been doing it for years.

				As far as your health goes, as long as you are not just smoking, eating, and sitting around, you should be fine.<br />Taking your vitamins, eating properly, staying active, and keeping the smoking to a functioning minimum is the most ideal.<br /><br />sdesu
