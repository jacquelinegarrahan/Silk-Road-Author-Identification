				to be honest...anything can kill you if you&#039;re genetically predisposed to have a negative reaction or allergy to it...<br /><br />people have died from eating peanuts or shrimp even...

				Just to expand on what gestalt said: Anything has a chance to kill someone who has been dealt the wrong cards. X could kill someone with an underlying heart condition/defect but the same could be said of taking too much caffeine--if it&#039;s a heart issue (I don&#039;t know why these 2 anomalous deaths occur on average). Some of those deaths might be misinterpreted dehydration deaths (sure the X caused you to party and sweat hard but the person could have prevented problems by staying hydrated) <br /><br />If you are considering ecstasy, it&#039;s important to trust where you&#039;re getting it from and know what you&#039;re getting (MDMA[purity? 80% etc.], MDA, some RC being called ecstasy). When I first tried X, it was just loose MDMA crystals and I had an idea of the reputation of who I got it from, I had equipment to measure out an appropriate does(always better to start low end), and then I tried it in a controlled environment before ever going into the world. <br /><br />If you are thinking of a more allergic-reaction style impact then just scrape a piece of the pill or shard(very small amount will do) on the tip of your tongue and see if any irritation shows up, which won&#039;t take long ~minute after contact.&nbsp; (although pure MDMA is very bitter and might turn you off the taste of it for a while--better to bomb it anyways I think). You may also be able to do a scratch test with it on your inner arm but now we&#039;re wandering into the dangerously paranoid territory.&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br />Hope some of this helps! Good luck, have fun, be smart<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish
