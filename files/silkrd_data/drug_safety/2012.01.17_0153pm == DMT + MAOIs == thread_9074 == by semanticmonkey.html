				hello<br /><br />thanks to SR i&#039;ve recently tried DMT. it was wonderful, but unfortunately doesn&#039;t last long. so i start to search information how to prolong its action. and find an article about Monoamine oxidase. which is destroying DMT molecules and that&#039;s why it works so short time. then i find article about Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and i believe this is the solution for a longer trips. <br />so here is the question: what kind of MAOIs do you know? how much does it cost and where can i buy it?

				Walter (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/15883) carries some Banisteriopsis Caapi Alkaloids which should be what you are looking for.<br /><br />When DiMiTriSpice (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/32181) comes back to vend he usually carries Changa, a blend of DMT and an MAOI for smoking, and Pharmahuasca, a blend of DMT and MAOI in a pill for eating/swallowing.<br /><br />You can also use Syrian Rue (available online) and there&#039;s likely many more options out there.<br /><br />I generally find changa (DMT+MAOI) to be longer lasting than DMT, but less vivid. Sort of like a low resolution trip to hyperspace that feels more like I&#039;m drifting off into a dream than the usual rocketship blast off.<br />I wouldn&#039;t say that it simply prolongs the trip though. While similar, changa is certainly it&#039;s own beast.<br />With a blend of DMT/leaf being 1:3, I find a quarter gram is nice for a good breakthrough. Doses of .1-.2g will &#039;breakthrough&#039; for me, but I can&#039;t usually get stuck staring at the jimjam (Squishy, goopy, sticky, stringy matter of hyperspace that anything can be created from. It is multicolored and delicious [from: hyperspace lexicon]). More recently I&#039;ve been enjoying doses sub-.1g, feels like a low-dose acid trip that lasts about 15 minutes and then tapers off.<br />

				Extract the harmine from syrian rue, im sure google can find you a guide very easily.&nbsp; Makes things very easy, just smoke the harmine and then smoke the dmt shortly after.&nbsp; I would provide dosage but im not confident in my dosage knowledge with harmine, i have only done &quot;Pharmahuasca&quot; (sp?) one time.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be as intense as just smoking DMT but it will last a good few hours like an acid or mushroom trip.

				Ayahuasca is the name of the drink that many cultures use which is DMT plus an MAOI, so that their &#039;journey&#039;s go into the hours.<br /><br />Just use caution, MAOIs retard your bodies ability to metabolize and break down many drugs, even acetaminophen.&nbsp; <br />Used correctly they are great potentiators and I say have a blast, just be mindful if your on other meds/drugs and of what dosage/potency MAOI you are using.&nbsp; Many MAOIs can have lingering affect&#039;s on your body for a few days, so don&#039;t be hitting your gear too soon, mmk?
