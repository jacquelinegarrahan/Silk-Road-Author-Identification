				If withdrawal symptoms get too bad you can use benzos to help with some of the symptoms.&nbsp; Benzos can be very addictive, so be cautious.

				Isop<br /><br />One month isn&#039;t to long, but still long enough. I went through some discomfort in wd&#039;s recently and what really helped me in the past was clonidine, some Ibuprofen, and benzo&#039;s. Recently these were NOT available to me, so i was recommended Kratom, honestly it really shortened my wd&#039;s and made the worst of the symptoms much shorter--only a day long of the bullshit/ uncomfortable feelings versus 4 days and the rest of the week wasn&#039;t great, but much much easier than i thought . Its perfectly legal and you can get it online in a couple days. I was skeptical at first but it really helped me and a buddy of mine who used it for 1 month to successfully get off the Suboxone. Good Luck

				Honestly mate it&#039;s gonna be rough anyway you look at it.<br /><br />Although IBOGAINE can help tremendously. Iboga trips are fucking harsh as they are but one day of that is infinitely better than a lengthy h withdrawal.

				after 72 hrs you should feel wayyy better..<br />24 hrs is OK, some discomfort, then once u start getting ot the 2nd day it gets a bit better, then BAM clear before the storm.. the 2-3rd day is the absolute WORST.... after the 3rd day it gets way easier..<br /><br />weed and benzo&#039;s = comfortably sedated.. and you will get&nbsp; sleep! that is the worst part about the WD lack of sleep...<br />Also if you get bad leg pains&nbsp; WALK do not lay in bed.. walking takes away all the leg pains <br />the more you just lay there the more your going to feel it and want to cut off your legs, or do anything possible for another dose...<br /><br />But then again your a IV user, I only have cold turkey&#039;d from nasal use... From talking to a buddy that IV&#039;s he gets same WD symptoms plus vomiting I have never experienced vomitting, expect the last time I went from pebbles to subs, around the 24 hr mark I woke up and just threw up a yellow liquid, first time I have thrown up while stopping opiates..

				Only doing H for 1 month the w/ds will not really be a challenge at all. Perhaps get some Benzos or Midazolam for sleep or some Ketamine if you turn out to be one of those people who seems to get really bad withdrawal symptoms.

				get yourself some imodium (buy it at amazon where you can buy it by the hundreds) you&#039;ll need more than the 2 pills that are recommended. I take a few, wait a few hours, and add some more. If you have imaodium and a little bit of xanax and advil and some clonidine, you should have only about 10 percent of WD&#039;s. but everyone is different. Since you have only been doing i for a month, thats in your favor. If you can taper and have the willpower, then do that. But if its cold turkey, the immodium route is the best. remember, immodium is really an opiate, it just doesn&#039;t cross the blood brain barrier very well at all, so it will help with the shits and other aspects of wd. it wont take all the pain away, but its a lifesaver..

				I lost my father to a h overdose when i was 10 years old. Im 28 now and im going down the same road. Its shitty and something you should quit, but easier said than done....<br /><br />The fact that youve only been using for a month is gonna help you. The worst of it will be over in a few days, but the long term (PAWS) effects can suck if you are one of the unlucky people that get it. <br /><br />Depression, lack of motivation, mood swings and much more could be some of the things you will be facing soon. Its shitty, but if you can do it now you are saving yourself from a lifetime of misery. <br /><br />Im a miserable prick if I dont have any drugs. I can go about 36 hours before the inital wds kick in. Ive quit multiple times, but Im just not the same person i used to be without it. Good luck and be safe!<br /><br />Peace

				Yes, what Joey said. The physical part will be mostly over within 3-7 days. Then the mental shit happens. The depression is sometimes bad. you may want to see a professional even before detoxing. I know a shrink will give you comfort meds. I had one actually give me darvocet and boy, that was a life saver. Its very hard to get tru the WD&#039;s alone. you need help. If you have a partner that will help or go see a therapist. sometimes the mental aspect is harder than the physical. but im hoping that you have only had a habit for a few weeks that they will be kept to a minimum.

				sweats, chills, diarrhea, leg cramps, insomnia, vomitting, basically all the miserable side effects of the flu but multiplied by 1000. It is a miserable experience. The pain normally gets to it&#039;s worst point at the 2nd or 3rd day and will get better each passing day, a physical kick takes around 7 days but the mental depression can last months. I would consult a doctor before home detox for sure. Get a lot of immodium that stuff helped me a lot.<br /><br />Good Luck &amp; Godspeed.

I hear heroin WD is far worse than DHC WD, DHC withdrawal was the most horrific and agonising experience I&#039;ve ever been through so I can only begin to imagine the pain of quitting heroin cold turkey without anything to ease the pain.

				Find a listing on here for suboxone.&nbsp; Order around 2 or 3 of them.&nbsp; ONLY TAKE A TINY BIT - after you have started feeling like a shotgun is the only solution.&nbsp; This will help for around an entire day of w/d&#039;s.&nbsp; You will still have slight sweats.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just keep repeating that until the 2 or 3 are gone.&nbsp; Then, you will still have to come off the subs, but its nowhere near as bad as the H.&nbsp; And with only using 2 or 3, you shouldn&#039;t have a new sub addiction to deal w/.

				As several have said, it&#039;s the mental that usually takes u back out...if you&#039;re young, physical doesn&#039;t last too long, on H.&nbsp; For me, first day isn&#039;t so bad, 2nd day is bad, 3rd day I start feeling a little better...but I always give up and start chasing dope again, so unless you can put yourself out of reach, it&#039;s tough to stick with plan...<br /><br />A good site for all kinds of good ideas, and, more importantly, great support, is opiophile.org ... <br /><br />I&#039;ve found in past, that if in the middle of the worst of it, I can get some lightweight opiates--darvocets come to mind, or codeine, or some vicodin--that then it&#039;s not so bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />My problem is that if it gets bad enough, I&#039;ll either score, or trot down to the methadone clinic when they open, and then it just starts over again....tho I will say, having a few methadone pills on hand--which you can buy here--sure does help when u are sick.<br /><br />Best wishes with this, I&#039;ve found that experience--like I&#039;ve got--doesn&#039;t make it better.&nbsp; I just make sure I&#039;ve got a bunch of juice and candy bars, a book and some movies to watch...and hunker down...good luck bro...<br /><br />

I found value in my life, and entered the done clinic, was there for 2 years, and got out. just started using, RECREATIONALLY, and realized, no longer than 24-36 hours at a time, and take time off. keep it enjoyable, dont make it a lifestyle,<br /><br />that is all<br /><br />good luck<br />

				If you want to greatly reduce the withdraws while using nothing that is illegal (as to pass your DT and not worry about the cops) then pick up a sample of kratom, a plant that can be bought at almost any ethnobotanical site.&nbsp; Brew a tea using 5 or more grams and your WDs should vanish.

Withdrawal is a nightmare, but with suboxone it is really NOT that hellish of an experience. I&nbsp; still get a little sub buzz when I space out my dosage correctly and I&#039;ve been scripted em for about 2 years. The hard part, as everyone says, is the time that comes after withdrawal. That&#039;s when you&#039;re just trying to keep it out of your head, and like most junkies this is what always fucking gets me. Days, months, years... It is the NEVER again that is the hardest part, because if you are like me that &quot;I&#039;ll only use once a month&quot; somehow always turns back into 3x a day.&nbsp;
