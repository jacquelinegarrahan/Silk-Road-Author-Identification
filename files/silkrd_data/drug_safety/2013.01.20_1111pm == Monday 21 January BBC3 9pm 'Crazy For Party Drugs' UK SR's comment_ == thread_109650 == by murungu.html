				Here is the promo for this documentary...<br />DURATION: 1 HOUR<br />Britain&#039;s drug culture is changing - fast. Cocaine and ecstasy are out and mephedrone, ketamine and GHB are in. Shot in Leeds over the biggest party weekend of the year - Halloween and Bonfire Night - this film gets under the skin of the new party drugs. We follow Holly, Tony and Oliver from the dancefloor to the morning after and, with unique access to the first specialist &#039;club drug clinic&#039; outside London, we find out what happens to those who want to keep going even when the party&#039;s over. <br /><br />I&#039;m gonna watch, then get back here on Tuesday and lets see if it is truthful or bullshit, and why!<br /><br />

				There were (to coin a term) too much of the whole kids-in-Ibiza-wot a- lark - &#039;ey? To be &#039;panorama&#039; ....but the whole condemnation thing was toned down, they were very subtle, they let the subjects be the message.&nbsp; and there&#039;s the morality lesson once again. Drugs hmmm bad hmmmkaaay! Yes they are if you go gaga on them. Just like cheeseburgers.<br />

				people you don&#039;t know what torrent is ? I already have it on my pc. torrent is a program where you can download stuff from movies to videogames toi tv shows you don&#039;t want to buy but want to see/play. It&#039;s a victimless crime if you buy stuff you like and stuff that is worth your money.

Most mainstream media companies, such as the BBC, are &#039;thought spinners&#039; for this shadowy elite. The internet has really put a dent in the control they have over the masses though. It really has opened up new ideas and the freedom and availability of information will topple these people who only have money, control and power on their minds.

				watched all episode mostly trash people &quot;addicted&quot; to mephedrone and ketamine if they&#039;re not actors. the message i got was don&#039;t do these new drugs because they&#039;re not safe and addictive do old school drugs like mdma and cocaine instead.&nbsp; BTW people like these give drugs a bad name, how can someone let themselves so hopelessly get addicted to these recreational party drugs.

				Agreed. It&#039;s all propaganda they hit you with to make people want to go out and do drugs... Think about it, if you&#039;re caught with a few grams of any controlled substance its likely you will receive an on the spot fine of between £60-£120 (I don&#039;t know exactly) or go to court and have a fine handed to you there.<br /><br />It&#039;s all profit for the government at the end of the day.
