				Two weeks should have your tolerance down to almost zero but waiting a month or two will make it more magical.

				My tolerance seems to take longer than average to some down, takes 3 weeks. Can trip after 2 weeks tho, but have to up the dose a bit in that case. Also tried tripping 1 week after the previous trip, but somehow the magic seems to be missing, even when taking double of the previous dose.<br /><br />You&#039;ll be fine, have fun :)

				First off, check out my thread in my signature. Most, if not all of your LSD inquiries can be found there. If not, ask and you shall receive. <br /><br />Secondly, how long is long enough to wait between L trips for tolerance to be a non issue, is almost as subjective and the molecule it self. The leading factor of this is the quality of the LSD. Other factors include but are not limited to; diet, sleep, mood and use of other substances. <br /><br />If the L is very good and very clean, you can dose every other day or so and still not be let down by your trip. With lesser quality LSD, to achieve a worthy trip, while dosing so closely to your last trip, you will most definitely have to double up on your dose, at the least. <br /><br />Now, the real &#039;magical&#039; aspect of LSD, the feeling of seeing the world and everything in it that you know, for the first time will no matter how high quality the L is, can not be brought back with out having hit absolute baseline before dosing. A true baseline for LSD tolerance is no less than 4 weeks. <br /><br />JackieChans blotters are some of the best that SR has to offer, so in your current situation, 3 weeks or how ever long you said its been, will be just fine. Enjoy!

				Thanks, Dirty. You mentioned use of other substances. Are there cross-tolerances with other substances?

				Yea smog, most any drug that reacts with your serotonin receptors will have some degree of cross tolerance.

				I took 2-3 hits a day for about a 3 month stretch in 1995.&nbsp; &nbsp;Oddly enough no tolerance seemed to develop...and no interference that I remember from other substances.&nbsp; Although I don&#039;t think I did much else psychoactively besides alcohol.&nbsp; &nbsp; I guess I got the LSD bug out of my system b/c I only dosed a half dozen or so times after that intense 3 month vision quest.&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)

				I completely disagree with the idea that the quality of LSD determines tolerance. Even the best LSD in the world is going to create a tolereance.<br /><br />I personally have plenty of experience with top grade LSD and if I don&#039;t wait 2 weeks in bewtween trips I get significantly reduced results.

				Everyone&#039;s different. Some build tolerance fast, some don&#039;t. You just have to find out how your body will react.&nbsp; Of course the only way to find out is through experimentation ;D

Again, it will not be the same and you will have to up the ug a bit. Where as with shitty quality crystal, youll have to double the dose at the very least to feel much of anything, when droping days apart.
