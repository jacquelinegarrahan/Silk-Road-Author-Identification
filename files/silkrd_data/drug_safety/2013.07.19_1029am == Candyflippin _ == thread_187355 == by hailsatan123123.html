				Yo guys ! so today is the first time I&#039;m in possession of both drugs , I have 1 blotter of a delicious Dali lama and a half a gram of molly&nbsp; and i wondering if it;s actually worth combining them both ?? Ive heard some interesting stories of people who tried it some said they had really positive experience and some didn&#039;t really enjoy it.<br />I know the dali takes about an hour to peak so whats the best timing to do them both ?&nbsp; because it&#039;s all about timing and i don&#039;t wanna mess this up so please share some valuable experience as this may help me a lot :)) <br />

I guess try it so see how you&#039;d like it.<br />I took my MDMA 2 hours in, and it wore off before the acid did- left me feeling pretty awful.

				I have only had amazing experiences candyflipping. I took 180ug and let it sit in my mouth for ~10 mins then took a molly pill (140mg). I am always impatient for the comeup and was thinking &quot;aw man this is bunk!&quot; Then I looked down at my hand and noticed every tiny little line and texture. I felt amazing, gonna be jedi mind flipping next Saturday!&nbsp; ;D

				it&#039;s worth trying both as the combination can be incredible. half a gram of mdma is too much though. i would take the lsd first, then a few hours later take 125 mg of mdma. of course you can redose another 125 mg if that isn&#039;t enough, but the synergy can be quite strong.
