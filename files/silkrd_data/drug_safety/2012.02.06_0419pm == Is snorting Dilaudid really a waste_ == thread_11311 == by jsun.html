				I have some 8mg on the way and I don&#039;t IV (which I understand is the preferred method) I normally snort roxies/oxy on occasion I&#039;ll eat them.&nbsp; During my research I saw lots of people saying it was a waste and some people saying they got off pretty good.&nbsp; I have a decent tolerance I can toot two rox 30&#039;s and be where I want to be.&nbsp; Anyone care to chime in?

				I&#039;m also not sure about others, but when dilaudid 8mgs were available locally about two years ago my friends and I all got off pretty good by insufflating. It was nice and potent.

				Thanks for the insight; figured since I have never tried it before, I would start with half a pill and go from there.

				for a casual once in a blue moon (less than that honestly) opi user like me snorting is great, imo<br />i snorted 2mg at a time, waited for it to come up and then did another 2mg, iirc, i don&#039;t think i ever went past 6mg personally, that was my limit at the time. i think i&#039;d recommend doing the same, at the time a 2-3mg buzz was my preferred way to do it

				People say that snorting dilaudid is a waste because they IV.&nbsp; The dilaudid rush is kind of, well orgasmic for lack of a better description.&nbsp; The real waste is eating it imo.&nbsp; Horrible BA and yet lots of pain patients enjoy it that way.<br /><br />I say if it works for you it isn`t a waste.&nbsp; I can`t even get off on dillies any more.&nbsp; I have to be outright sick to feel even 32 mg of it.&nbsp; Too much methadone I guess.<br /><br />With that said, if I was going to inject anything, dillies would be a good place to start.

				I agree zys. D&#039;s are such short acting opiates that the real value lies in that amazing rush. Best rush I ever had was from 2 K8&#039;s at the same time. It&#039;s a beautiful thing!
