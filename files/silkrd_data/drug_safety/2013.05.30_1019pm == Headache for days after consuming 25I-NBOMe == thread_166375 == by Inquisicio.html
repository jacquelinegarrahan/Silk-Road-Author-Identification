				Sup,<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken half a blotter of some 25i sold here on SR - I wanted to keep the dose low for my first trip because, well, it&#039;s a RC and I like being alive, mostly. <br /><br />Now for days afterwards I&#039;ve had headaches, I felt nothing of that sort during the trip. <br /><br />Can anyone else relate? I haven&#039;t seen this as being a common after effect in my research on the web. <br /><br />Feedback would be appreciated, thanks!<br /><br />- Inq

				I took some 25i semi-recently and wont take it again. Afterwards, for a period of time I kept having weird &quot;episodes&quot; of a strange feeling in my head. Not sure if I would describe it as a headache, but it was weird and different than something I had felt before. <br /><br />Can&#039;t positively attribute it to the 25i use, but it seems like the cause. Either way, scared me.<br /><br />Even though the 25i experiences I had were some of the most fun experiences I have had with psychedelics.

				I haven&#039;t had after effects but whilst on the chemical I certainly felt rough in places. Guess that&#039;s what you get for doing RCs. I think I will stick to LSD in future.
