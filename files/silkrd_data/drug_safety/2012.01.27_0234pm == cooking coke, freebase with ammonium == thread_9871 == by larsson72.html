				i usually cook with baking soda, but would like to try the ammonium&nbsp; way of doing it, i work in a lab so i have access to various chemicals, would lab grade 29% ammonium hydroxide be OK to cook with ?<br />anyone give me any tips?<br />would only be doing a gram at a time

				I&#039;m no expert, but apparently 29% is too high. The guides that I&#039;ve seen recommend using 10% ammonia. Have a read through this thread, it should answer all your questions.<br /><br />hxxp://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/335233-Making-freebase-cocaine......the-correct-procedure!

				I am working on a cocaine review.&nbsp; This method sounded great because it would let you understand what other types of chemicals were in your cocaine (sort of).&nbsp; As it turns out, it&#039;s not nearly as good as it sounds.&nbsp; I wasted 1gm of expensive coke last night following this procedure exactly.<br /><br />Here are the problems:<br /><br />1) The basic idea is to slowly increase the ammonia concentration and remove the precipitated materials at each level.&nbsp; The author talks about this as if all other materials precipitate before the cocaine does.&nbsp; While this might be true, it seems to me that there is only a 50% chance that any given chemical preciptates at a lower ammonia concentration than cocaine, so (unless someone knows something I dont and can say that cocaine for sure &quot;the last in line&quot;) it actually only allows you to remove half of foreign materials, not all.<br /><br />2) If you read the comments further down the page (on the bluelight thread), at some concentration the solution damages the cocaine.&nbsp; they dont say at which point.&nbsp; they also dont say at which point cocaine preciptates (though you can calculate an approximate point if you follow the math quickly, it seems like this is something that should be documented if the procedure were any good).<br /><br /><br />3) A similar procedure has been known for years.&nbsp; There&#039;s an book called the &quot;cocaine handbook&quot; (david lee, 1981) that describes the procedure.&nbsp; An ESSENTIAL step is left out:&nbsp; After the cocaine base precipitates you mix in some ether and shake, because the cocaine base will dissolve in to the ether.&nbsp; Then you ciphon off the ether and wait for it to evaporate.<br /><br />People like to say &quot;this is how richard pryor&quot; almost died.&nbsp; I suppose that&#039;s a great reason not to do it.&nbsp; But the problem is without the ether step what you end up with is cocaine base along the walls of your beaker, test tubes, and on your filter papers.<br /><br />I am using lab grade qualititative papers, glass beakers, gradulated pipettes, and a glass stir rod.&nbsp; I am reproducing the steps described faithfully and I can say beyond any doubt that the system described on bluelight is not useful for purity measurement. <br /><br />Also, the filtering does not filter all the material as it drops back in to suspension easily.&nbsp; It could be that my ammonia concentration is too low, not sure.&nbsp; But since the correct concentration is not specified and there is an unspecified an upper safe limit there is a lot of questions left in the procedure.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				im only cooking my coke up so i can smoke it, freebase, heres the method im going to use<br /><br />the best way to make crack off cocaine is to cook it with ammonia just put the coke in a spoon add ammonia and cook till the coke is oil and the ammonia is clear like water then cool it with water or just wait .. the better the quality the faster it turns into a rock (crack) if the coke is crap you will see that you lost a lot .
