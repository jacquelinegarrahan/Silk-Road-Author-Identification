				Whenever I take MDMA, I tend to have a really bad time coming up as my veins constrict really badly. My usually protruded veins constrict so much that I can barely see them. At the same time this happens my body temperature shoots up due to the vasoconstriction and I usually have to sit somewhere cold for a while.<br /><br />I know vasoconstriction happens to people on MDMA, but I&#039;m wondering how common it is and how dangerous it is - should sitting in the cold should lower my body temp effectively?

				Have you tried using an anti histamine? I find benydryl to help when i have those problems. I normally take benydryl before using any drug that releases serotonin.&nbsp; Normally one is fine but sometimes i have to take another during the peak. I promise it won&#039;t make u pass out and waste your drugs. :)

				Thanks for the advice sniper. Would be a bit concerned taking it though since MDMA has such a massive effect on my temp, I&#039;m worried that I could be adding further risk. Getting a lot of ice cubes for next time...

				I didn&#039;t realize that benydryl elevates body temp. Hmm.. I see a lot of people saying that benydryl lowers temp. Can you please link me to your source? Or&nbsp; have you personally noticed elevated body temp when using benydryl?

Because the chemical can lead to constriction of blood vessels, it could aggravate blood pressure in people who have hypertension or are borderline hypertensive. Antihistamine side effects such as this make it dangerous for patients to overdose on the medication<br />http://www.antihistamine.com/antihistamine-side-effects.html<br /><br />However they do cause dilation in response to elevated histamine for example if an allergic reaction occurs <br /><br />couldn&#039;t find anything on body temperature but vasodilation/constriction has an effect body temperature<br />

				That&#039;s crazy because if i don&#039;t take a benydryl i end up barely able to breathe. I wonder why benydryl fixes that for me? I mean i know i got asthma so my lungs are fucked up to begin with. But, after reading that bluelight link it&#039;s really got me thinking. I know of many people that post load with 5 htp. I always smoke weed everyday no matter what. Someone on that thread states not to smoke. They are crazy, imma smoke weed until i die. :D
