				Has anyone experience with this combo?,I will be taking coke + GHB tomorrow with the intention of having great sex. Sometimes I can&#039;t get hard on coke so I wondered if this should be the case if it would be safe to add a little Viagra or Cialis?

				For the record : Never do this combo!, the coke + GHB is alright but mixing GHB with viagra/cialis doesn&#039;t go well. I did some research on the net before so I knew that mixing the 2 could be dangerous because they both lower the blood pressure but I wanted to try anyway so I took a minimal amount of viagra(1/4 of a 100 mg pill) to see for myself and well it doesn&#039;t get along.

				Yeah that sounds like a really bad combo haha. I mean coke with viagra alone is bad for you, remember that the purer the coke the easier it is to get hard. It&#039;s normally when the coke is cut up with speed or some other type of amphetamine that doesn&#039;t allow you at all to function.

Then I start selling real coke, do three fat lines and I&#039;m ready to go!
