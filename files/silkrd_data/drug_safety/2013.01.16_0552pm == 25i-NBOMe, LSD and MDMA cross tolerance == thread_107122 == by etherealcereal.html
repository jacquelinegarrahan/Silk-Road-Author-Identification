				At a 3 day festival coming up I was planning on taking 25i-NBOMe on the Friday night, then LSD midday Saturday followed by MDMA Saturday night. <br />I know that all of these act on the 5HT2a receptor so obviously the effects will be somewhat lessened, but I was wondering how severely my LSD trip would be affected by the 25i the night before. <br />If the LSD would be almost ineffective the day after taking 25i, would it be better to take that Friday night then 25i Saturday? Or would it be better to just take the 25i Friday night then candyflip on Saturday?

				They all have a large cross tolerance with eachother. The nbomes will greatly affect your LSD trip, may not even feel a medium to medium strong dose. I suggest the LSD first and a good strong dose. good luck friend<br /><br />EDIT: The MDMA you will feel just as strong regardless of the others, its simply to powerful not to feel, just may have to up the dose very slightly, like 50mg prob. Only if you take some pure MDMA before the L or the RCs, then you can almost count on getting MDMA like feelings and sensations and side effects, such as jaw chattering or eye fluttering, while on your LSD trip. The MDMA really fucks with your brain chemistry for days even weeks after a heavy dose. again, good luck friend 8)

				MDMA is not a 5-HT2A agonist but a serotonin releasing agent. It might give you a slight tolerance on all serotonin receptors but not enough to ruin the effects of other psychedelics so you should take MDMA first.<br />LSD and 25i, on the other hand, are two of the most powerful known 5-HT2A agonists so you might want to decide between one or the other. If you want to do both though, don&#039;t do the 25i first. You don&#039;t want to waste your LSD.<br />So I&#039;d do it in that order:<br />MDMA<br />LSD<br />25i

				I was contemplating doing the MDMA first, but I read somewhere that I&#039;ll feel shitty the day after which will affect my LSD trip. But if that&#039;s not the case, I&#039;ll do it in the order you suggest Ballzinator, thanks.<br />I know that 2c-b and 25i-NBOMe are both phenethylamines, so does that mean they&#039;d both have the same cross tolerance with LSD?

Also the LSD might just cancel them out.<br />25i and LSD are extremely selective 5-HT2A agonists and 2C-B is mainly a 5-HT2C agonist so cross-tolerance should be minimal, if existent at all.

				I have been away from drugs (except alcohol) for over 8 months although it seems MUCH longer. :P<br /><br />Opportunity knocked again, and I ordered up a storm on SR, 25i NBOMe, weed, poppers (offsite), Psychlobye Cubensis mushrooms and of course when it arrived, I sucked up everything that came through the mailbox like a milkshake!<br /><br />The intention was to use them all as a euphoriant/porn enhancer/fun trip.<br /><br />Anyway, I dropped a Tyler tab 1000ug on the 1st night and here is what happened.<br /><br />T+ 0:00 Placed 1000ug uncomplexed 25i NBOMe under tongue, tastes bitter and &#039;chem-like&#039; but not unpleasant, surfed Erowid for trip reports until i got the first alerts at <br /><br />T+ 00:20 The alerts are that I&#039;m are not 100% &#039;sober&#039; feels like the distraction of alcohol without the drunk feeling.<br /><br />T +00:45 Wavering visuals at edge of vision, can&#039;t focus on tasks without really thinking hard. Slight nausea, but also waves of speedy euphoria.<br /><br />T +01:00 I vape a small amount of weed, its weak weed, but it potentates the N bomb. Thoughts become profound, or &#039;insightful&#039;.<br />I get this sense that my feminine side is talking to me. This is seriously weird, it is like one half of my brain is female, and is &#039;guiding&#039; me through the porn from a female perspective, not in a low-brow way, but how the act of fucking is in fact sacred, and results in the ongoing march of the species, considering what I&#039;m trying to achieve, this is deep stuff. I find I&#039;m feeling sensual, but the porn is forgotten as my brain sails away on all this female-relatedness. Just for the record, I&#039;m away currently from my wife (nic: 1st lady) for an extended interval as we have stuff in our lives that is bigger than both of us at present, and we are a continent apart, and I miss the hell out of her, but that is all in the real world... <br /><br />T +2:00 Right now, this wonderful chem is full of good humor, and the whole female introspection thing becomes full-blown camp mind-games, so that gay, straight, in between, I see it all in its sensual beauty and it&#039;s all human nature, and its all good, and OK. I re-dose on weed, and then remember I have some good quality poppers in the freezer, so I grab them. Now I hit the poppers, but the porn really is not making much sense, at any rate it is not arousing me like it does on just weed, for example. The N bomb is demanding more from me intellectually than just choking the chicken to Chipy Marlowe and Elodie Cherie. The poppers are just not &#039;doing it&#039; like they normally do. <br /><br />Time goes out the window, my room thermostat reads a tropical 33C/91F at one point! I turn down the heating (I was freezing as I got my first alerts hours back) It&#039;s suddenly midnight. I&#039;m tripping balls, no visuals, but great good humor and just feel fantastic. <br />I realize I have been fiending mindlessly on the poppers for hours, the bottle is two thirds empty. I have burned my nose with the liquid and my lungs and throat are raw.<br /><br />T +04:30 I finally blow a load and literally see fireworks behind my eyes! It&#039;s not as intense as an orgasm on meth, but I&#039;m best leaving meth in the past, I only flirted with it about a year ago, and then walked away. I did it because it was on the bucket list, and I knew I was soon going where it would be near impossible to source and very dangerous if caught (as in death penalty!) But I digress.<br /><br />T 04:30 - 06:00 So I crawl into bed, and just let the chem wind down, it takes a further two hours and I drop off somewhere close to 3am having dosed at around quarter to eight p.m. There are some muscle tension everywhere and jaw clenching, but again, its no meth grind.<br /><br />Final thoughts: In some ways this drug reminds me of meth, but it seems to distract from raw animal sex, and replace it with a sensuality. Music was great. I should have allowed the chem to set the agenda, put the poppers away and turned the porn off.<br /><br />There was a scene in a porno where &#039;cops&#039; bust in on the action, it was such a negative vibe, man it really was a big downer, and not just because the couple were busted fucking, just the guns and the violence, and yelling, awww shit, spare me!<br /><br />I have a hundred 1000ug tabs, so I will be doing more with this chem, and trying in in many dosages and settings and with one or two other chems besides THC.<br /><br />This was my seventh or eight experience with this chem, all the other times I had used it whacking off or for fun with the &#039;1st lady&#039; but this time the chem really stood out for me, and probably the most I have had in one sitting, I think I was using 500-750ug last year but can&#039;t be sure. I do know the tabs last year were &#039;complexed&#039; but this tab was way more potent in uncomplexed form.<br /><br />Next post, I will share about my serial dosing results and cross-tolerance with shrooms...<br />
