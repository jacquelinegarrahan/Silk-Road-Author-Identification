				Got some of that mdpv...<br /><br />Erowid described 5-10mg&#039;s orally/insufflated..<br /><br />Took 20mg insufflated, really want to feel the effects and HAVE to stay awake.<br /><br />Nothing fun is going on. My heart feels like it&#039;s going to pop out, my right arm tingles.. which happens when you&#039;re gonna have a heart attack..<br /><br />What should I do?? Take more cuz on the reports its about 10 times as much.. eat a shitload of benzo&#039;s, take 2cb mxe or ket?<br /><br />I know Im probably not gonna die (although this feels like fucking fucked up.. even 1 gram of medium quality speed in 1 time was not this bad...<br /><br />What the fuck do plants use it for?<br /><br />Beh mdpv or whatever you spell it sucks fucking much and is expensive.. I&#039;d rather eat some mud a pig just rolled in and had fun, jezus christ!

				Oh yeah 199 is also an option.. but by the time they understand MDPV and INSUFFLATED and SHIT and STREET and CITY I&#039;d just want to die instantly and perhaps they track gps and clean up my room while they&#039;re at it...

				Take some benzos, smoke some pot. Eat something with fat and short-chain carbs in it.<br />Why the fuck did you start with 20mg? Erowid lists that as a very strong dose:<br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdpv/mdpv_dose.shtml

Overdosing with this stuff is extremely easy. There&#039;s a reason one of its name is demon dust.

				Still it&#039;s all there on erowid...<br /><br />I remember something alike with 2fa or 5-meo-dalt...<br /><br />Also that the dalt can be smoked.. but only freebase can be smoked.<br />Weird info on the net.

				lol yeah I know I&#039;m late but I dont think you were in any danger.<br /><br />Surprisingly, mdpv has been taken in enormous amounts by people and they came out alive.<br /><br />I just recently found a new appreciation for the devil dust honestly.<br /><br />First time I did it was about 6-7 months ago. I snorted 10 mgs and told myself I wouldn&#039;t do any more. (convinced myself to do the other 90 mgs that night and stayed up for like 36 hours)<br /><br />but yesterday, I gave it a second try, but I know how morish this shit is so I decided to eat it.<br /><br />I ate somewhere around 3 mgs, and at about 3 hours ate another 3, and I had good productive energy for the rest of the day.<br /><br />Not much of a comedown, OR an urge to redose. slept without problems although I was up till 2 in the morning :P<br /><br />There was slight euphoria but it wasn&#039;t enough to be distracting. <br /><br />Just thought I would share... If you have mdpv and you don&#039;t feel like going insane eat it in small amounts for productivity.<br /><br />And don&#039;t do over 10 mgs :)<br /><br />

				lol, nothing is up with them... just start small till you get where you want to be. dont go with the highest dose possible right off the bat :P .<br /><br />This is the most potent stimulant I know of so there is nothing wrong with babying the dosage IMO
