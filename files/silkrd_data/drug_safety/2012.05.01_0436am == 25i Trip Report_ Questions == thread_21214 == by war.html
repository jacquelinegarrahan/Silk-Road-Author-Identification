				Don&#039;t want to start another thread asking random questions so I will turn this into a trip report tomorrow :)<br /><br />Put one of Kwiks tabs in 25 minutes ago (its still chilling in my gums) and I cut it to an estimated 600ug.&nbsp; How long should i wait before taking another tab?&nbsp; I took a couple benadyrl just to easy anxiety but no affects yet.<br />

				I usually start with 1mg or 2mg and go from there.&nbsp; 1mg is good for someone who has done LSD or psychs in general so they have a general idea of what to expect.&nbsp;

				I have been dosing, tripping, smoking, shrooming, rolling for 24 years, and I had some tabs from DR which I thought were 500ug so I took 2. It turns out they were 1mg ( 1000 ug ) tabs so I tabbed 2mg buccally. I held the tabs between cheek and gums for 40 minutes and then swallowed my saliva and continued to gnaw on the blotters until they disentegrated. It was a long come up ( around 55 minutes ). I felt the first alerts around 40 minutes, but at 75 minutes I was on my way to peak. It took roughly 45 minutes to get to peak with some significant body load ( read vassoconstriction/hypertension ), but after reaching peak, the body load chilled out and the effects of the drug came steady in waves for roughly four hours of plateau. I was able to eat during peak/plateau comfortably without affecting the ride ( sub sandwich and tater chips ). Now that was surprising.&nbsp; I have never been able to eat on LSD, MDMA or shrooms, and eating on Solaris was EASY. I&#039;m diabetic so that is a MAJOR plus for me and others in that boat. The trails from this substance are amazingly long and cause other visual distortions in their wake.&nbsp; Played fetch with my dog for an hour and she was 9 feet long all over the back yard with that NEON green tennis ball bouncing along in multioles of 3 and 5 everywhere. These visuals were intense but not sustained. They came in waves about every 15 minutes or so. I never experienced any &#039;brain rape&#039; like might happen on LSD. It seems to me it had a similar body rush and amphetemine type high as MDMA and the visuals aspect was more shroomy and warpy than electric like LSD.&nbsp; The space was very pliable and plastic, and &#039;easy to drive&#039; if that makes any sense. Not particulary spiritual or enlightening, but certainly an interresting molecule. Bit of a body load with the vassoconstricition/hypertension, so have plenty of weed to smoke so you can vasso-dilate to offset the circulatory tension. I&#039;ve heard benadryl eases some of the tension on come up as well. Be sure to have sunglasses if you are a daytripper. My pupils have never been sooooo dilated ( well maybe at the eye doctor )!!!&nbsp; So I think for most people 1000 ug might be a good starting point. I did 1.5 tabs ( 1500 ug )&nbsp; 8 days later and it didn&#039;t quite get me &#039;over the hump&#039;, so consider the source. I take 120mg of Cymbalta, an SSRI, and I never stopped taking my head meds and I had a great ride. Maybe I&#039;m just used to the downstepping that my SSRI causes though. Like I said - consider the source. Be carefule. Learn about the molecule before you dive in. It is a potent HT2A antagonist, and that may be of some help to read about. The ability to hyper-metabolize this molecule is also potential ( I have read of people dosing at 5-8mg on this crazy stuff!!) That kind of dose I wouldn&#039;t be able to handle considering the 10 hour experience I had on 2mg.

Stimulants and psychedelics make my blood sugar drop, I usually inject less insulin if I plan on taking something but correcting an hypoglycemia on things like amphetamines sucks, while it&#039;s easy on 25I. Another reason why i like this chemical a lot :)
