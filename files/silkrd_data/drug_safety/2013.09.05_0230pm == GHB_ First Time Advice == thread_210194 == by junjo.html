				Hello, So I saw we finally got a domestic vendor selling reasonable quantities of GHB (Zrem), and I have questions about his product, GHB&#039;s effects, and how to stay safe on it in general.<br /><br />1)His description is really weird (obviously some language issues), but I&#039;m assuming that his 60 mL bottle is at a 1g/mL concentration, containing a total of 60 g Na-GHB. Is this correct?<br /><br />2)How should I do my first dosage to avoid an accidental overdose? Based on erowid, and other advice, I was thinking about doing a 0.25 g test, waiting a couple hours, and then doing 1.75 g as my real dose. Let me know if I should do less for the first time (or more so I&#039;m not disappointed). Basically, I want to do enough to get the full spectrum of effects without any potential of becoming physically ill or blacking out. I weigh 160-165 lbs and have generally normal metabolic pathways.<br /><br />3) Should I give the bottle to someone to watch it after I dose? What are the odds of me stupidly re-dosing and blacking out? I assume that re-dosing is just a bad idea, right?<br /><br />4) How many days/hours should i wait after the last dose of other depressant drugs before consuming GHB? I use heroin on occasion and take eitzolam when I&#039;m stressed, but neither is a habit. I don&#039;t drink any more so alcohol use shouldn&#039;t be a concern. The only other drug I take on occasion is meth, but don&#039;t plan on using any time soon.<br /><br />5) How do the effects of GHB compare objectively to alcohol? heroin? benzos? Which drugs do you liken GHB most to? What should I do on GHB?<br /><br />Remember, you don&#039;t have to answer all of these. Just one would be appreciated, and any more would be fantastic. I think that&#039;s all for now. I&#039;ll ask more if I can think of anything. Thanks!

				anyone? i know that bluegiraffe has a guide but<br />a) I&#039;d like personal anecdotes<br />b) I&#039;d like it from a less biased source than a vendor...

				1 - Check with the vendor if your unsure or the listing is unclear. If your still unsure you may want to find out how much GHB can dissolve in 1ml so you can at least minimize your risk by diluting and taking a tester dose.<br /><br />2 - Do a light erowid dose. GHB is naturally occurring so your body knows how to break it down safely and quickly. Then when you dose again gauge it from there. I don&#039;t think you can get the full spectrum of effects in one dose.<br /><br />3 - Not a bad idea. I have a tendency to black out with a lot of downers but I didn&#039;t have a problem at all with GHB but everyone is different so handing it to a sitter is a good idea.<br /><br />4 - H and etizolam both have a fairly short half life I believe. I would leave it until next day just in-case due to your inexperience with GHB and H + benzo (or thienobenzodiazepines) not really good due to risk of respiratory failure adding GHB in the mix isn&#039;t a good idea especially if your still feeling any effect.<br /><br />5 - With my limited experience with it it&#039;s kinda like alcohol but without the hangover/asshole drunk effect. Nice and chilled but has quite a steep dose responsive curve.<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly inexperienced with GHB but follow some basic harm reduction and you should be fine. You may find a little tolerance especially if you have any built with your etiz use. I found diazepam seemed to produce tolerance for GHB so im assuming anything that works on GABA receptors is probably going to produce tolerance

Sent some karma your way :)<br />I also heard some stuff about GHB having &quot;MDMA-like&quot; effects, which I thought was kinda weird for a downer. What was your experience with this? Thanks again!<br />

				I didn&#039;t really feel the MDMA like effect that you&#039;ve mentioned. Maybe it&#039;s because it relaxes you and allows you to open up a bit more in social situations. TBH I really want to experiment with it a bit more but I&#039;m a little concerned about being addicted to it if I buy more than a few doses, I could see it could be something that could be taken at night to just chill you out. I&#039;ve heard some horrific tales of WD so just be careful...<br /><br />It looks like GHB could have an effect on serotonin uptake which along with the dopamine release may explain a slight similarity to MDMA. I think this is dose dependent though and it maybe the case that a lower dose gives you more of that feeling. Maybe you could someone more experienced through some of the sellers review pages in the rumor mill section of the forum. It&#039;s been a few months since I&#039;ve dabbled and it was a few doses over the course of 3-4 days so tolerance may have developed by the end.<br /><br />Thanks for the karma dude!

				Not sure... It was dark and I was camping sorry. I wouldn&#039;t imagine it would because i think drugs that do this tend to be drugs that work by flooding the serotonin and/or dopamine centres of the brain (opiates, MDMA, and all tryptamines/phenethlamines). I could be wrong though...
