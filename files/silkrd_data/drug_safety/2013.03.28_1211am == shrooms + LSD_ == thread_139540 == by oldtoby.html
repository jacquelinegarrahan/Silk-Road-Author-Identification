				Title: <strong>shrooms + LSD?</strong><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t normally think to combine substances that exhibit cross-tolerance - what would be the point? But recently on the forums I was reading someone&#039;s claim that shrooms + LSD makes for a better trip than a larger dose of LSD on its own. <br /><br />Anyone have any experience with this? What about timing? I&#039;m imagining the roller coaster climb coming up on both simultaneously might be a bit intense...<br /><br />Further, if both are good together, what about as a base for a candyflip? I&#039;m due, and could easily put the three together (or four, with mj).

				They combine very well. The come up is identical to taking one or the other IMO. The cross tolerance only matters if you trip on LSD one night and shrooms the next. It&#039;s identical in terms of tolerance to taking LSD and more LSD or shrooms and more shrooms. I feel that taking both gives you a fuller trip, in regards to the effects given. The visuals combine very nicely. With shrooms, things are always moving a lot more than on LSD, and on LSD you get the colors and fractals more often, so the combination makes the visual aspect much more intense. As is really all the other effects. I recommend taking them both at the same time. If you take them at different times it would be easier for one to overpower the other. Balance is key. <br /><br />On MDMA, I shouldn&#039;t really comment since I gave it up long ago, but when I did, I took the three together a few times and the result is bliss.&nbsp; :)

				you said that combining the two provides a fuller trip, but i must disagree... that&#039;s entirely dependent on dosage. you should try a higher dose . i took lsd and mushrooms recently (along with mdma, ketamine and nitrous) and it was beyond my wildest dreams. the perfect dose of each chemical combined in just the right way. i was in full bloom. :D

Really it&#039;s just about combining them the right way, but I mean hell, I think if you take any amount of either you&#039;ll have a great time. It just depends what type of trip you are going for. But yes, I agree, that obviously the more psyches you take the more intense the experience. When you combine say 1 dose of acid with 1 dose of mushrooms, I do think that it is more intense than say 2 doses of acid or two doses of mushrooms. Combining amplifies effects.

				A couple years ago I ate 3g of dried mushrooms and a hit of White on white that was like ~90ug... <br /><br />I&#039;ve never laughed so hard in my life as I did that night..

Usually I have a decent idea of how I want the trip to play out and I&#039;ll dose accordingly.

				Tried this combo once, am planning to do it again. One interesting thing I noted (and others have echoed me on this) is that the acceleration time for the second drug (shrooms in my case) is shortened, it sneaks up on you and just when you&#039;re wondering how long you&#039;ll have to wait - BOOM! Tripping balls. The shroom trip felt a little bit short though, even though I had a very low dose of LSD.
