				Hi,<br /><br />So recently I went on a bender and took Xanax at about 15mg a day decided to get off it and went into ED.<br />Now i am on 90mg of Valium a day and want to get of the crap it effects my sport work and i want to try and manage my anxiety naturally .<br /><br />How Fast can I come of since i have only been on benzos for a total of about 4-5 weeks?<br />Ive been though been through valium and xanax withdrawals before and they are horrible so ibuprofen,paracetamol,codeine on hand also I have my diet spot on and taking multivitamins and probiotics, fibre drink and everything i can do to get back to&nbsp; normal. <br /><br />Also Lots of exercise, relaxation techniques stretching and smokes ha ha ha..<br /><br />What would be a good schedule to cut down since i think now is the time before my body becomes too dependent on it?<br /><br />cut down 5mg every two days?<br /><br />I know im in for allot of pain but Im sure i can handle it.<br /><br />What would your suggestions be?<br /><br />Thanks for your time<br /><br /><br />

				Hello!<br /><br />Firstly serious kudos for taking this step, respect!<br /><br />I did a bit of medical journal searching and got this http://www.benzo.org.uk/amisc/ashdiag.pdf<br />which recommends tapering your dose by 1/10 or 1/8 every one to two weeks -i think if you&#039;re younger and healthy you could try 1/8th every one week and see how you get on, but you&#039;ll have to adjust this accordingly to how you feel. <br /><br />PLEASE keep in mind benzodiazepines have the most dangerous withdrawal sequale, including convulsions, psychosis, and a perpetual epileptic state, so if you notice shaking of your hands or just generally feeling not right slow down your tapering, as youre getting close to running the risk of those nasty neurological symptoms. In this instance having a short acting benzo like Xanax or Zolpidem will help, i appreciate this may seem a step in the wrong direction but you must be careful. <br /><br />also avoid caffeine and codeine, as theres evidence to suggest it lowers your seizure threshold. <br /><br />Good luck! <br /><br />
