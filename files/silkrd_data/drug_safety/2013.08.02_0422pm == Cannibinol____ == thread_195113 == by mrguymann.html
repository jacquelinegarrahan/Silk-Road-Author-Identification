				A couple of different old timers told me of something they used to get like in the early 70s -they called it Cannibinol. The name gives me the impression of some type of synthetic marijuanna derivative. But , according to these guys it only took 1 or 2 cent little line and they were crawling on the floor for hours. I thought well maybe it was PCP , but they tried that more than once and were familiar with it.<br />&nbsp;Is there anyone out there who might , know&nbsp; something more about it? My best guess is it was some type of weird mix , that someone called cannibinol to make it sound appealing.

				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinol<br /><br /><br />Cannabinol is not something you can get high off of.&nbsp; It is one of the most medicinal chemicals in medicinal marijuana and is great for relieving pain.&nbsp; It is becoming very highly sought after in this field now.<br /><br />You definitely can&#039;t do &quot;lines&quot; of this stuff. <br />

				Ya, I think it was somekinda&nbsp; angel-dust/ belladonna extract concoction that they tried to give it an&nbsp; appealing name&nbsp; so the druggies would try it. there must be no old geezers on these forums who can tell us&nbsp; stories about walking 5 mile in the snow to score a lid in their day.
