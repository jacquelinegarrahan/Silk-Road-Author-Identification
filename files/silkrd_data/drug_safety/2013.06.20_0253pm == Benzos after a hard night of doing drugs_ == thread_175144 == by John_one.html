				Anyone have any experience in using benzos, when you can&#039;t sleep after a night with a lot of speed and alcohol or mdma and alcohol?<br />I was thinking about buying some to help me sleep.<br />Is it a good or bad idea? If it&#039;s good, what kind should i buy?&nbsp;

				I usually do about 1mg or 2mg&#039;s of Xanax after a night on MDMA, coke or such alike. Defo works better than Valium for me in terms of putting me to sleep. <br />Be sure not to drink to much alcohol before you take the xanax, I usually have no more than 5 drinks when mixing with coke/MDMA or other things. As mixing two downers causes a higher degree of CNS depression with can result in death (extreme cases) Although I have mixed about 2grams of GHB, 3 beers and about 6mg&#039;s of Xanax after a HEAVY night on cocaine. Woke up still very much under the influence of the downers but feeling very hungover. <br />I tend to only take 1mg of Xanax if I&#039;ve had say, more than 2 drinks. As <br />1. it can be dangerous 2. it makes for a weird hangover mixing the two.

				Depends on you tolerance i supposed.<br />A Xanax 2mg bar can be used as a sleeping pill for an average adult male.<br />It will knock you out and once you sober out of it youll feel pretty good, and rested, but youll want more.<br /><br />Dont take them with the MDMA/Speed/Booze as they do not compliment each other.

I personally have a Xanax (Alprazolam) prescription; yet I only take it when I need it for anxiety issues, or after doing a drug like MDMA, LSD or Amphetamine to settle down when all is said and done. I&#039;ve irresponsibly taken it WITH amphetamine, and it felt amazing.<br /><br />However, it&#039;s always in moderation (no more than 2mg and usually only 1mg) and taken infrequently (once every one or two weeks in recent times). I did have a period where I was taking 1mg every weekday, but even when I stopped that I never experienced any withdrawal symptoms or cravings.<br /><br />That being said, plenty of people develop severe addictions to the drug class and they are reportedly hell to come off of. They are, however, fantastic for alleviating the &#039;hangovers&#039; of substances like MDMA, or for getting to sleep after ingesting a substance like LSD.

				There is reason for concern, especially when alcohol in involved.<br /><br />Combining alcohol and benzo&#039;s can result into respiratory depression which in some cases has a fatal outcome.<br /><br />The widespread notion on this is that they should never be combined, which is probably sound medical advise, but rarely practical. Moderation would be the key answer here, as well as erring on the side of caution.<br /><br />Thins like xanax are often suggested to be used as an agent stop a bad trip and such, and tht works very well. If you have been drinking too you should have someone present when you sleep it all off though. The risk of fatal respiratory depression is not very large, but on the other hand you should really ask yourself if you want to risk dying from it.

				It sure is tempting, but you may just have another drink to fall asleep in such circumstances,<br /><br />Surely benzo&#039;s will help you sleep, but actually waking up the day after is somewhat important too :D

				I wouldn&#039;t be able to sleep without xanax after a night of Mdma use.&nbsp; I would stay up all day restless and won&#039;t be able to sleep until the next night, it was horrible lying around the house like a zombie all day.&nbsp; Now I just eat me a light meal, wait an hour, and then take 2mg.&nbsp; I&#039;m out in a couple minutes and wake up refreshed!&nbsp; Xanax has been a lifesaver.<br /><br />PS - I don&#039;t use xanax recreationally

				Be aware that benzo withdrawal (if you become addicted) is some of the scariest shit known. It particularly comes on quick with short half life benzos like Xanax.

				Do NOT mix benzodiazepines with large quantities of alcohol. You can easily black out and do very stupid, dangerous things. You may take a low dose of Xanax (.5 to 1 mg) while you are heavily drinking, but I would not take any more than that. Once you are sobering up from the alcohol, you may take more (not to exceed 4 mg). I&#039;m serious. The mix can be deadly, be very careful. I&#039;m speaking from experience.

				Prescription drugs (from a pharmacy, not SR) should come with a leaflet that actually does mention all these problems. both combination with alcohol, withdrawal issues and such. It is up to the user to to read that information or not.<br /><br />For benzodiazepines it certainly does caution against the combination with alcohol.<br /><br />GP&#039;s should still explicitly mention it though, since the leaflet with many medication is the length of your average EULA and probably not much easier to understand unless you have a background in biology, chemistry, medicine or such. <br /><br />Pharma companies don&#039;t seem overly eager to help either though. Things like 20/30 mg citalopram are often in a tablet form that is virtually impossible to break in half with bare hands. I suppose they&#039;d rather sell yet another prescription for 10 mg tablets when you want to stop using them, despite having enough in stock to break in halves or quarters over a period of months.

				The risk in combining benzo&#039;s with alcohol really is a doubly edged sword.<br /><br />You can, and often will, experience effects like anterograde amnesia, which are not very dangerous despite being experienced as very uncomfortable by some. <br /><br />The dangerous effects arise it&nbsp; higher dosages where respiratory depression becomes a risk. This is not a condition that causes massive deaths at all, but it is somehting that happens to certain persons under unfortunate circumstances. Sadly, it is not possible to predict who will fall victim to it and who will not. <br /><br />

				Amazing i dont know how you guys get knocked out from a 2mg xanax, back when i had a toleaance i sometimes took 50, but i would sewriously wwarn against that, anyway, if you have zero tolerance to benzos i would recommend taking two 30mg serapax, or five 5mg vallium, or one 2mg xanax bar. Either of those options will make you feel nice and relaxed without knocking you out

				Well, that&#039;s tolerance at work. <br /><br />If you give someone just 1 mg of xanax and a beer, chances are it will knock them out for the rest of the evening. Surely they will not die from this, just be sound asleep when left undisturbed.<br /><br />It seems that tolerance to benzo&#039;s has more than one stage. The very first one, &#039;virgins&#039; so to say come with a quick knock-out effect, and people that only use them once a month or so seem to remain on that level. <br /><br />Once you get to more frequent use, say a couple of times a week, this knock out effect disappears completely for doses like 1 to 2 mg xanax. The anxiolytic function is still there though, so it is basically doing what you want it to do: reduce anxiety without knocking you out. <br /><br />The problems come with higher dosages, usually taken daily. The tolerance will gradually build to a point where you will need larger doses to achieve the desired effect, but at this point dependence also presents itself. <br /><br />Finding a stable usage pattern somewhere in the second of these stages is very tricky, especially because the unpleasant effects are gone entirely at this point, and there is little reason not to use any more apart from cost or fear of respiratory depression.
