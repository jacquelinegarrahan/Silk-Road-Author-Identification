				So, next week... Some family are coming down to visit me for a little while. The 2 that are coming down, are Avid Cocaine users, as am i.<br />But one of my family members is being a little curious when it comes to meth. She wants to give it a hit, and try it ( which im perfectly cool with, i know everyone she does where she lives, and noone she is friends with, has connections to more dope, so i don&#039;t really have a worry of her getting addicted. ) <br /><br />It&#039;s more so of how next weekend is supposed to be played out....<br /><br />I have about 3 -4 points left of my Crystal M. Aswell as 1.5g of cocaine, and 5 10mg Adderall. <br /><br />Me, the family member, and her boyfriend are going to be demolishing the coke with me, but im not sure when to bust out the dope and let her try it. I don&#039;t want to compound the Highs, and mix 2 already volatile stimulants. About how long should i wait after doing the coke, should i pull her aside and roast up a nice shard or two. <br />Or perhaps, would it be better, to give her the dope earlier in the day, let it run its 5-12h course, and after a few hours of relaxing, break into the snow flakes? <br /><br />All input is greatly appreciated. <br />And please, don&#039;t flame the thread with shit about how bad meth is, i know it is, she knows it is. The whole world knows it...<br />If you have a problem with it, thats fine. But i&#039;d rather be safe, and keep my family members safe when doing drugs ya know? <br /><br />so go ahead lay some knowledge on my broke ass

				I would go the second route and let her try the shards first as I imagine the coke will help with the comedown.

				O.o Are you sure?... like i don&#039;t like the idea of letting her mix drugs. Call me paranoid, but when it comes to powders...from previous knowledge, and common sense, it just sounds like a bad idea. But then again, im not a drug expert, im just a fellow enthusiast who likes to get high like the rest of us. Im too cautious to ever mix powders together like Coke and Meth. <br /><br />If you guys have successfully mixed the 2 together ( Safely of course ) Go ahead and post your method.<br />&nbsp;I need exact or near exact sizes/weights of shards of dope, and the size of line for coke. <br />The dope will be freebased, so we won&#039;t be polluting our nostrils with only one of those septum burning mother fuckers lol.

				Well i have never done actual Crystal meth but I have done a shit load of stimulants of all types (coke, MDMA, adderall, 4-fma, 4-fa, 4-mec, B1,E1,M1, P1, MDPV, and a lot of others I cant remember.) And I have also extracted and freebased adderall (which is practically the same as meth, I suppose) and If there is one thing that I have learned about amphetamine based stimulants, it is that nothing helps ease the comedown better than cocaine. More amphetamines just put-off and make the comedown worse when it happens (not to mention, it increases&nbsp; the likelyhood of addictive tendancies). But the dopamine rush of cocaine helps this immensely because its not beating the shit out of the already depleted serotonin receptors, but instead is providing a new pathway of stimulation while the serotonin receptors recover.

				Ah, well. I&#039;m glad that your knowledge of the subject will assist me hahaha. <br /><br />But Adderall in itself, is alot like Crystal meth. the high isnt nearly as strong as CM. But its pretty damn close to the same high<br />

				Yea I know. But the purity problems of CM scares the shit out of me. Especially when you consider the kind of dumbasses that produce the majority of it and the sheer variety of possibly dangerous byproducts involved.<br /><br />But when i smoked my purified adderall, the experience seemed like a textbook meth experience. So I guess i&#039;m splitting hairs on saying that I&#039;ve never done it.<br /><br />Not to mention, I can go through a bottle of adderall like i kid with a bag of candy on halloween. So I can only imagine what would happen if I broke through the social stigma and got into Ice. Bad news written all over it

				XD I like to consider it one of my darker hobbies lol.<br /><br />Just the process of smoking it is one the things that makes it so appealing to me. O.o the way you smoke dope from a oil burner, its so weird, and different. Idk, i guess after doing meth for a while, you kind of learn to fall in love with the whole process from buying all the way to comedown. The whole ritual of the thing is just idk...cool....to say the least? <br /><br />The drug itself, i do enjoy...But i honestly think its more of the smoking factor, and the freebasing factor that draws me specifically to Crystal.

				I don&#039;t know if you know any basic kitchen chemistry but you should try extracting/freebasing and smoking adderall some time. I could give you plenty of pointers if interested.

				@.@ Maybe 5 years ago in high school, i woulda kept some basic chem knowledge....not now though haha... <br />But regardless, i don&#039;t have enough faith in my abilities to be able to synthesize the amphetamines from the Adderall.<br />Or any other drug for that matter. Im not looking to make some Shake N&#039; Bake meth ya know?

				actually its as easy as making crack. or any other AB extraction for that matter<br />to summarize.<br /><br />Crush pills, and dissolve in water and couple drops of lemon juice<br />filter out the binders with a t shirt and then a coffee filter. saving the liquid<br />slowly dissolve backing soda until you see the freebase fall out of the water.<br />and then you can either pour it through a coffee filter and smoke the stuff in the filter. or you can mix an Non-polar solvent (VM&amp;P naptha, ether, ...etc) with the water, let them separate, and then remove and evaporate the solvent.<br /><br />easy as that.

				nah, i prefer to just eat the adderall lol.<br /><br />But that does bring up another question. I just came down off a good 30+ hour Crystal high, an im curious to know....how dangerous would it be to take a 10mg adderall, right after coming down off a meth high?

				As far as health risks, It shouldn&#039;t be any different than smoking a bit more meth. Since your taking it orally it might help you come down easier though. But please refer to what In my previous post about beating up your already depleted receptors. Maybe you would be better just taking a bump of that blow.

				Meh, normally... i would...but i know, if i do one bump...there will be another...and another....and another... lol until its all fucking gone<br /><br />so i cant dip into the coke anymore than i already have ( i did like 3 or 4 really nice gummers to ease the pain in my tongue from grinding on my teeth as i tweaked ) an my 1.5g of blow is probably down to a 1.3 ....and 1.3 is fucking difficult enough to share between 3 grown adults with addictions lol.

				it depends on what kind of adderall you use but the water may dissolve some of the binders.<br />i would highly recomend doing the final part of extracting the amphetamines with the non-polar solvent and evaporating to make sure nothing is lost (and the product will be much more pure). but if you just wast to basify and filter you will probably want to let the water settle in the freezer until everything falls to the bottom and then filter. if you do it that way then the filter will contain a powdery substance of various colors (depending on the color of the pills used) which consists mostly of the freebased amphetamine and a bit of other random binders/fillers from the pills.

				Well, the pills i have, are 10mg IR Brand name Adderall. The tiny blue pills scored down the center with some numbers n junk on&#039;em . Cant remember them off the top of my head. But i think, im just gonna crush them all up, and snort them later this weekend with my visitors.
