				I recently order a g of coke and mda from different vendors, both from canada, on the exact same day. Its likely they will arrive at the same time, so I was wondering how I could tell the difference between the two. Obviously a reagant test would work, but I&#039;m looking for other ways i.e. smell, taste, looks etc.

				It is very easy to tell the difference between the two. MDMA is usually an off-white opaque crystalline substance with an EXTREMELY unpleasant taste. Just taste a tiny bit and you will know for sure. Very distinctive.<br /><br />Coke in my experience has little taste, maybe slightly bitter, and if it is good it will numb your tongue. It is also usually more powdery than MDMA however I have never seen high purity coke so if it is highly pure it may look different.

				Lol I think MDA/MDMA tastes nice to be honest but hey, that&#039;s just me. <br /><br />Anyway yeah MDMA/MDA and Bing look totally different OP. MDxx looks more like glassy crystals and Bing looks like a white powder. One has anesthetic properties (Bing) and the other doesn&#039;t (MDxx)

				The local anesthesia is going to be the most telling characteristic for distinguishing them. I&#039;d recommend dabbing just a little bit on your tongue from each. I also feel like cocaine actually usually tastes like plants (though many others don&#039;t agree with me on that). MDMA should indeed be bitter...

				Also, most Bing smells like diesel (or should). It does depend on how it&#039;s made though. There are a few different routes.

				mdma taste&#039;s like spraying hairspray on your tongue or Satan pissing in your mouth and usually comes off-white, tan-ish colour crystals. Smells a bit minty! <br />Coke is a white power that when you rub in your mouth will make it go slightly numb,

				Thanks for the help guys, it really shows how great and caring this community is. So my buddy whos holding it tasted a tiny bit and said it tasted like absolute shit, then slightly numbed his tongue. He said it reminded him of pill popping so I&#039;m gonna have to assume that&#039;s the sass.

Bing mostly smells like fuel. The only sensation MD should give you is maybe a menthol sensation so it may feel cool but it wont numb you in the anesthetic sense.
