				hi <br />this was the only way to get powder back in the day. <br /><br />bring small pot of water to boil on stove<br />place pyrex or another heat tempered plate or shallow dish on top of pot so that 90% of the opening of the pot is covered and the plate can rest easy on the pot. <br />make sure the water is at a simmer or easy boil<br />place liquid on plate<br />wait til water evaporates from the liquid k leaving a fine crystaline powder.<br /><br />ive always though this powder was better than the RM powder you get out of india today, but thats just me <br /><br />when i was doing this i would get about 1.5 g out of a bottle of Ketaset however that was almost 20 years ago so i cant be sure. good luck

				That is one way and prob the most common way i hear of people cooking their K. <br /><br />There is many many ways to do this. Loads of people will swear by particular methods be able to leave you with a higher yield of dried ketamine than other ways. The more rapid the rate at which you evaporate the liquid solution, the lighter your end result of dried k is said to be. I personally can not say for sure, only because ive never got weighed it up after a cook. <br /><br />The idea of cooking K, is just that. Evaporate the solution to be left with ketamine flakes, which you chop to powder. Some other ways to do this are: using the microwave (not recommended, unless for large large amounts), simply putting on a pair of ovegloves or oven mitts and doing it directly over a flame ( this requires skill and experience with cooking k, cause it is very easy to burn the k) in a pyrex casserole dish, or least common just dumping the liquid onto a plate or something then letting it set out either atop a radiator or under a heat lamp to slowly evaporate over a few days time (said to give the best yield).<br /><br />How ever you do it, the idea is.. apply heat, evaporate solution, DO NOT BURN. Good luck.

				Thanks for the replys so far I now understand how to get it into powder.&nbsp; If anyone has any more info on yield from a 10 ml vial that would be much appreciated.

				Let it evaporate if you have time and want the largest crystals.&nbsp; Use low heat if you are in a hurry.&nbsp; There is nothing difficult about this and certainty no guide required. ;D
