				Alright guys so I know I probably will get some crap for asking this but fuck it. I&#039;m going to anyways:)<br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal. I&#039;ve taken MDMA approximately 3 separate occasions now. Every time I&#039;ve taken it was from a 5 gram order I placed with Supertrips a while back. (End of summerish) Once going to the mall with a friend because it just came in and I knew the next time I would take it wouldn&#039;t be for longer than a month and I decided I wanted to try it. The second time was at a homecoming party and finally the last time was at a rave. <br /><br />Now the first time I took MDMA was before going to the mall. I took it and felt little within an hour. Once an hour hit I felt something, it wasn&#039;t that great but I knew I was feeling something, then during the mall it was okay I guess, we just walked around a lot. I think I didn&#039;t feel much because my lack of scenery and I didn&#039;t really know what I was supposed to feel.<br /><br />Now the second time I took it was before homecoming. I knew I wanted to really feel it this time so I took a bit more than the first (around 150 probably) and I did it with my friend and our two dates. Now we decided we wanted more of a speedy roll. So we all took the MDMA with 1 50 mg Vyvanse pill. If you don&#039;t know what Vyvanse is it&#039;s a new version of Adderall, a &quot;prodrug&quot; that can only be used when ingested. I&#039;ve taken Vyvanse before and my tolerance was pretty high. (Normally take around 2 and have done that plenty of times.)&nbsp; We were on our way and it hit everyone pretty hard. I could tell it was the MDMA not the Vyvanse. When I got to homecoming I felt really good and could tell my friends were too. We were dancing for hours and it felt amazing. The euphoric feeling was there and so was an energy type of feel. We all were talking to everybody non stop. Now after the MDMA wore off I could still feel the Vyvanse. It was good because I had energy the rest of the night and the comedown was actually easier I believe. <br /><br />Now the last time I took MDMA was before a rave. My friend and I agreed to take it without Vyvanse because we wanted to just feel the Mdma. We dosed (around the same) and it hit us both hard in around 30 minutes. We got to the rave and it was amazing for around 2 hours. The problem was it wore off after 2 hours and we were both just really tired and crabby. I believe it was stronger for the first two hours without taking Vyvanse but with Vyvanse it was much longer duration. We both agreed next time we would take a Vyvanse pill because we liked the feeling much more.<br /><br />Now my first question, is this what is supposed to happen? Or should we have felt the MDMA longer and just not taken Vyvanse? Is it safe to take Vyvanse with MDMA and will it make it more of a speedy roll like I felt above? Finally, should I go about taking Vyvanse next time? I&#039;m planning on doing it at a rave again and have about 5 of the blue Defqons all ready to go:) <br /><br />Thanks guys. If you have any questions for me let me know.
