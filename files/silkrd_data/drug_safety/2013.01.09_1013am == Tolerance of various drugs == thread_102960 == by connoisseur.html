				Travelling SR wonderland and discovering substances on offer I only read about until now I would like to develop this thread about developing tolerance&nbsp; and cross-tolerances towards various drugs. <br />Information about building resistance to the point where one feels no longer the effects of a drug is also welcome but I aim for a list of minimum times of breaks between enjoying the same substance to its full extent again. <br />Also feel free to report any drug combos that are either harmful of gave you an otherwise memorable experience.<br />Ideally all posters fill in their experiences in alphabetical order of the drugs they have consumed, by replacing the question marks.<br />Pls copy the list into your follow-up post and fill with your knowledge.<br />T=tolerance<br />CT = cross tolerance<br />UI =user info<br /><br />Amphetamine: ?<br />Cannabis: No tolerance<br />Cocaine: ?<br />DMT: No tolerance<br />DOB: ?<br />DOM: ?<br />Heroin: ?<br />Ketamin: ?<br />LSD: Minimum one week<br />MDA: ?<br />MDMA: Minimum of 90 days recommended by A.

				I would strongly disagree to the no tolerance on Cannabis, I remember when just two puffs of high grade would get me really stoned... <br />My MDMA tolerance is pretty much completely reset after about 4/5 weeks. MDA is the same.<br />Ketamine I don&#039;t do enough to get a tolerance, same with Cocaine, 2c-b and Mephedrone.

				It would require more detail really.<br /><br />As pointed out cannabis has some tolerance issues, but has little risk (of death) with sudden withdrawal.

				I like the idea of this getting fleshed out but I&#039;m too lazy (at the moment) to do too much work on this (I already spend too much time on drug projects on SR&nbsp; :P) <br /><br />Here&#039;s a couple first thoughts:<br /><br />Amphetamine: tolerance. Not sure on how long to wait but probably a 4-7 days will get your tolerances down (although, as with anything that you can abuse heavily, I think there&#039;s a possibility of permanently fucking up your baseline). <br />Cannabis: Definite tolerance. Tolerance levels may not ever go back to baseline but I&#039;d say at least a week-a month of abstaining will show marked decrease in the amount needed to get high.<br />DMT: Immediate tolerance. No redosing for, ideally, 48 hours. If you hit some and don&#039;t get where you need to be a reload will likely be a waste. You just got to wait it out. I flip on this idea a lot but better to conserve your drugs.<br />Ketamine: My own view on this is a couple weeks. Also, I believe it has CT with certain opiates and shouldn&#039;t be combined with benzos/opiates<br />Methamphetamine: same as amphetamine only I think the buildup of tolerance is faster because, depending on the meth, it can be so easy to keep hitting it up. <br /><br /><br />Just some of my own experiences. Definitely no websites to back this up off the top of my head but a rough outline of some of my experiences/attempted delays. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				+1 to you - GREAT idea for a thread. I hope it fills up with info - and in particular, hope someone puts all the cross-tolerance of various psychedelics together in one place (though, on reflection, I wonder if erowid has just such a chart...).
