				Hey guys,<br /><br />I made a forum account just for this, I&#039;ll be honest.<br /><br />I wanted to ask opinions on the best way to candy-flip. I&#039;ve got half a strong blotter, and getting some of SKYY&#039;s MDMA, so I thought I&#039;d try combining the two after reading about it.<br /><br />From what I hear the best way is to take the LSD, wait an hour or two, then bomb, and then it should be...well, amazing.<br /><br />Anyone got any tips? Or a better general guide?<br /><br />Cheers, Petrochlaor

				Be careful on doses! <br /><br />SKYY&#039;s mdma is very strong, so combined with acid you could end up extremely fucked.

Their MDMA is pretty similar -- both amazing.

				Yeah, I&#039;m basing my MDMA off a measured dose of 150-200mg, based on 1.5mg to 2.0mg per kilo of mass.<br /><br />I&#039;m heavy set, 100kg, so I thought that would be the best way to measure. Either way, I&#039;ll prepare for it hahaha.<br /><br />And good to hear more gleaming reviews about SKYY&#039;s stuff, I&#039;m quite excited now.

				I drop the MDMA about 3hrs after taking the Acid, that way you peak on both substances at the same time. I stupidly dropped a Clonazapam prior to the trip and couldn&#039;t remember any of it. Apparently I went clubbing for a few hours and I never though I left the house. Will probably try it again soon.

				Candy flipping i quite the experience. I&#039;d recommend keeping some MDMA to bump up before the initial dose wears off. I find that I get a little tired once i come down from the roll, and LSD should keep you going for a while after the initial dose wears off. I prefer to keep active while tripping to experience everything the night has to offer and its hard to do that when you start you burn out.

				I candy-flipped once with LSD + E and once with LSD + MDMA and I found the LSD + E to be way better and more euphoric. But then again the MDMA that day was from a new source so maybe it wasn&#039;t was good or something...

				When I first candy flipped, I took the MDMA first, then about 1.5-2ish hours later took a few hits of LSD. I might try switching the order of the two next time. Regardless, it was an interesting experience - (especially walking into the bathroom).
