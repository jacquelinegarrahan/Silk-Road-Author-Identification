				I think I never got this right.<br /><br />Heroin, morphine, opiates and opium are all derived from the poppy plant, is that right?<br /><br /><br />

				To answer your question technically, all opiates come from the poppy plant, but when i say plant, i really mean the poppy pod. However, the pharma companies that have poppy farms process the pods, stalks and even the roots (the roots were discovered to include a ton of alkaloids as well). <br />Out friends in the golden triangle probably just take from the pods. Raw crude opium that is excreted after making a slit in the opium pod during the peak of its growth contains a number of alkaloids that we all love and know such as morphine, codiene, thebaine.... These alkaloids are processed to make synthetic opiods such as oxycontin, fentynyl, etc... (sorry for the spelling, im stoned, but the information is correct). Yes, it is true that we can get both pharmacutical morphine and oxycontin even tho one is natural and one is synthetic, but one can be found directly out of the opium pod, the other must be manufactured. <br />The raw crude opium crap that comes out of the pod is processed into morphine base, which is a high crude brown paste, the shit we know as opium. Heroin is one step further... heroin is produced by acetylation of morphine which creates one of the worlds most ridiculous drugs ever... diacetylmorphine, or heroin, comes to us in different purities, resulting from multiple chemical purification processes that costs tons of money to produce due to the low yield.

				Yes, the roots of Papaver Bracteatum are what contain the most Thebaine, the compound that we get most of our oxy and other synthetics from. <br />And yes, illicit heroin starts its life as raw opium which is gotten from the ripe pods of Papaver Somniferum. From there the gum is washed to remove any impurities and the next step is to convert to morphine base and then through acetylation of said morphine heroin is refined and blah blah blah.<br /><br />OP asked a simple question and a simple answer was given.<br />

				Yes mito.<br /><br />From raw form to most purified form:<br />Poppy pods&gt;powdered pods&gt;opium&gt;morphine&gt;diamorphine (heroin)<br /><br />But opiates can also include synthetic chemicals which target opiate receptors in the brain.

				^^^ Good explanation.<br /><br />What effect could you get by drinking tea made of crushed dried poppy pods?<br /><br />

				^^^ It&#039;s quite a nice buzz due to all of the active and non-active alkaloids working in synergy with each other (i believe).<br />You have to try it to get a full understanding. It&#039;s different from all of the others in its own little way.&nbsp; I recommend getting some and trying for yourself. You may want to get some weight information in regards to dosages from other members as I used to just dose by the amount and size of the pods i.e. if they were large pods I would use 3-5 or if small pods maybe 8-10.<br />Just remember to start small because like one respected member likes to say, you can add more but you can&#039;t take any away. (paraphrase).<br />Above all else be safe and enjoy!
