				My rules for doing it (these are for beginners/moderates)<br />1) Doing another line with a heart rate above 120bpm isn&#039;t safe. Not that it&#039;s going to hurt you, just IMO lines under 120 (small, &lt;100mg lines) are not going to hurt you. Over 120, there&#039;s a small chance. Over 150 you shouldn&#039;t do more. Over 180, you&#039;re going to seriously harm yourself.<br /><br />2) you should ALWAYS acetone wash your shit. Klean-strip acetone, glass funnel, glass beaker, medium flow filter papers and you&#039;re set. This is $20, what was that ball? If you read up on it you should use a dropper for the acetone, but on the first go you can just pour (esp cooler/drier). This will take you a day (acetone needs to evaporate) but that&#039;s about the only downside; the upside is your shit will be cleaner, any hint of oiliness will be gone, and you know that what you&#039;re doing is mainly psychoactives (not necessarily coke, but better than blowing lines of god knows what).<br /><br />3) Never buy when you&#039;re high. Set this rule early and if it gets drilled in you will help yourself potentially down the line.<br /><br />4) 90% of people i know who do coke a few times feel the desire to do more. Don&#039;t start doing it more than once every month or longer unless you aren&#039;t at risk here. This isn&#039;t addiction, but it can affect people. For rich fat white girls who want to be pretty and skinny though, this can turn into addiction (or others with money/desire to use beyond high).<br /><br />5) Have some something nearby to deal with OD (valium or xanax works well). Snort a full dose of the downer, these are similar to what an EMT would give you and will help for an ODer. Also note, coke OD begins with shaking beyond trembling and extreme paranoia. If this happens to you, take deep breaths and seek medical attention (or get to some public location so if you keel someone can call 911).<br /><br />6) Check your laws. a lot of places have laws saying trace amounts (i.e. on your iphone) or paraphernalia (a cut straw or flat mirror is enough) is a felony charge.<br /><br />7) If you are getting caught DO NOT EAT MORE THAN .5g. Friend of mine thought it was much less psychoactive orally (it&#039;s significant) and ate a ball when he got pulled over and his heart got fried. (you can possibly eat up to a g, but I wouldn&#039;t risk eating as it hits you somewhat slower and can&#039;t effectively be puked up).<br /><br />I could go on but that&#039;s enough

Benzodiazipenes are not bioactive nasally. Which means when you snort them they drip down into your stomach and they get you high in your stomach as if you swallowed them. You probably even waste some in the process. Just parachute a pill if you want it to hit you faster. If you keep benzos around, you will always want to take them to sleep and thats dangerous.<br /><br />That aside, I like to snort a small bit of water after each line. It sounds funny but it reduces irritation on your nose big time. Just a few drops will do the trick. Your nose will thank you for it in the morning.

				Gum it (apply it to your gums) instead of snorting. I find that the intensity and duration of the high is very similar to snorting but cocaine on your gums is a lot less harmful than cocaine in your nose. Plus if you have dental pain it is a great oral anaesthetic :P. Actually I used coke to deal with the pain from a cavity filling, worked way better than the opioids I was prescribed.

				1. Stick to bumps. if you want to get really high, take a bigger bump. Don&#039;t go to lines. I was never a line guy from the people that taught me how to &quot;use&quot; the drug when I started and I really credit this with helping a lot.<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t do garbage. I spent a few months doing stomped to hell shit and got rashes and nasal problems and barely got high. Know what you&#039;re buying.<br /><br />3. Dont do coke<br /><br />4. coke is a great social drug. if you want euphoria, there&#039;s better routes to go via RCs<br /><br />5. clean your nose with hot water, snort it and consider using saline spray.<br /><br />6. you aren&#039;t supposed to drink on it but man, i could drink like a rockstar on it.<br /><br /><br />honestly I am glad I stopped, it wasn&#039;t worth it, I wrecked all sorts of havoc on my body and it wasnt the best money. you can double or triple up but there&#039;s more profitable drugs and the more profitable ones dont ruin folks as much.

				Coke is cool but NEVER mix with MDMA.<br /><br />It is a killer combo and I should know.<br />I have a freind who OD&#039;d on this lethal mix.<br />It sounds fun but if the user is weak then they might go into a death bed.

				My rules are: <br /><br />always use clean gear. If you snort use a clean miror (not a dirty CD from somewhere in your truck) and clean that miror after every party. <br />never use a rolled money to snort, use a straw and NEVER share that straw - if you use with friends just have 1 straw each (very important for hepatitis)<br />never snort cleaned coke - it&#039;s to pure and will burn your nose (even if you will not feel it burning because of the effect of coke)<br />if you smoke it: stop smoking it (the adiction is worse than shooting H and there is no product such as methadone that can help you quit)<br />at the end of your night have some nasal water (H20 + NaCl) and clean your nose - don&#039;t do it between your lines because that will moisten your nose and because of that you will harm it more than if you&#039;d lett it dry (cocaine dries your nose so that on the next line there will be less C that sticks in your nose - if you moisten your nose more cocaine will stick to it and thus it will harm your nose more/longer)<br /><br />with a new product always start with half a line - you never know...if the products doesn&#039;t look or smell as it should, don&#039;t try it (better to lose money than health!)<br /><br />I prefer to snort half the line with my left nostril and half with my right nostril, it gives a better feeling and it&#039;s half the load on each side<br /><br />if you want another snort it&#039;s a good idea to check your hartrate, but that&#039;s so different from person to person AND from product to product (some high quality coke will barely affect your hartrate) that it&#039;s not a full proof method. Best is to &quot;know your chit&quot; and then you can quite well say when you&#039;re ready for your next line. don&#039;t overdo, never forget that coke makes you (self/over)confident and certain of yourself, thus you will probably overestimate your capacities - beware of this effect of coke when you use it!<br /><br />if you have to drive, wait for the &quot;rush&quot; to be over (about 30 minutes after your line) because it can affect your balance and that&#039;s extremely dangerous when driving<br /><br />if you drink beware for your liver. drinking &amp; cocaine are nice together (think of the song &quot;breakfast in vegas on cocain and gin&quot;), but it&#039;s almost impossible to get drunk when you snort cocaine - so watch out that you don&#039;t completely fuck your liver. I&#039;ve had nights when I drunk more than 2l of vodka and still didn&#039;t feel a thing...except the next day: because of the alcohol the &quot;down&quot; is very hard and painful (has nothing to do with the C)<br /><br />also: never put C in your mouth! it&#039;s poison for your gums and lots of diseases are transmitted because of people going over a miror with a wet finger (saliva) and someone else doing the same 5 minutes later over that (still wet) miror - C is not made for oral consumption!<br /><br />C is not very addictave in a physical way (compared to H or meth) but the mental addiction can go pretty quickly. It&#039;s always best to buy the quantity you need for one night and not more than that. If you&#039;re &quot;weak&quot; and have left-overs give them to a friend or even throw it away. Avoid having anything left in the house the next morning (especially when you smoked it!!!!). <br />Once you know the product and you know how it affects you, you might be able to keep a little &quot;reserve&quot; in the house, but you&#039;ll know very soon if you&#039;re a possible addict or not. <br /><br />I almost always have some reserve in the house and I can use for days in a row without problems, but when I stop I stop for a few months. <br />Beware of the mental &quot;come down&quot;, coke has 3 of them. The first one is 3 days after using, the second is 10 days after using and the third is around 3 weeks. Beware of that, it&#039;ll make it easier (and less dangerous for your family/friends/...). That&#039;s also a good reason why you should wait at least 3 weeks before doing it again (so that your body and your mind have had time to &quot;reset&quot;). <br /><br />For questions don&#039;t hesitate to PM me. <br /><br />Again: use clean gear &amp; don&#039;t share the straws!<br /><br />

				also does anyone ever get paranoia from coke?<br /><br />and is there anything you can do to help relax yourself so that you arnt so paranoid. (Is it possibly due to the adulterants/cuts in the coke that make you paranoid?)

				When they add (meth)amphetamines to the C (something that is very common in Europe, I don&#039;t know about US) there&#039;s a bigg chance of having some paranoia. <br />Probably some other products that are used can also give paranoia... <br />but just the lack of sleep (if you&#039;ve been partying for 24h, 48h,... ) can cause paranoia. <br />The best solution is to go to sleep. <br /><br />The best to avoid paranoia is to use in a &quot;safe environment&quot; with people you know and trust, <br />use it at a private party with some friends, not in a huge rave-party with 10000 unknown ravers. <br /><br />Especially when you don&#039;t know a product it&#039;s always better to get to know it in a safe environment. <br />Once you know the effect it has on you, how you react and interact with people and so on, then you might use it &quot;in public&quot; (but always beware of your local legal situations). <br /><br />

				Be sure it&#039;s coke. Know what it&#039;s cut with.<br /><br />Use after C pills if they are available where you live.<br /><br />Although I think coke is not THAT unhealthy. I dont even know what clean coke would hurt. <br />Then again, I am no coke expert. Way too overpriced the last 20 years. Effect is short very short. <br />

				one last thing: <br /><br />avoid brushing your teeth after using C, <br />always brush your teeth before and wait untill the day after<br />(because of the effects of coke you want feel a thing in your mouth, therefore if you brush your teeth you will brush it way too hard -trying to get the same feeling as when you&#039;re sober &amp; because the coke is so harmfull for your gum you will harm your gum as well). <br />This is off course more important for regular users/long terme users - but it&#039;s always good to know.
