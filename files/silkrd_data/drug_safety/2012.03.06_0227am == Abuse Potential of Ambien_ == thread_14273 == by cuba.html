				Not really.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get a tolerance and it&#039;ll just stop working pretty soon.&nbsp; Then you have to lay off it for a pretty long time for it to even work again.&nbsp; I took it every night&nbsp; for like a month and it stopped working.&nbsp; Waited a month and tried again and it still didn&#039;t work.

				In my experience it&#039;s one of those drugs that has POTENTIAL for abuse but the Trip isn&#039;t really all that fun. You just start going crazy and then you get the complete blackout and end up doing stupid things. I used to take one of them and start drawing and make some interesting scribbles but I can also point to four or five people I know who have woken up in a hospital (occasionally a mental hospital:/) after taking too much Ambien. Be Careful.

				I take ambien every night for sleep. It sucks because sometimes I need more than one and that will eventually make me run out early... and then I can&#039;t sleep when I don&#039;t have one. They also make me sleep eat sometimes, so I have to take precautions at night so that I don&#039;t do that!<br /><br />So I&#039;d say just stay away from them altogether. I wish I could find something else that helped my insomnia. Unfortunately, over 20 years, my doctors haven&#039;t found anything else that works.

				Definitely has abuse potential but in my experience not as much as other sleeping pills. Just take it for sleeping, don&#039;t take it around people of you&#039;ll just embarrass yourself or do something extremely fucked up.

				It&#039;s abused relatively popularly. At relatively lower dosages, it behaves like other benzos, and so you can get regular benzo effects that way. It gets stranger with the higher dosages, though I&#039;m not sure I could say those experiences are very positive. It&#039;s like trippy alcohol: you do really stupid shit but everything is jumping around.

				Abuse is possible with any drug, it really depends on what you are using them for. My first hallucination experience was caused by Ambien. I could not swallow pills when I was young and I was having a hard time sleeping so my ex decided to crush a pill and I had it with juice. Crushing a pill that is supposed to be a slow time release caused me to have very vivid hallucinations while laying in a semi-dark room. The walls had vines, waterfalls and snakes on them. Quite a memorable trip!
