				I am&nbsp; craving a good empathetic opening. After several psychedelic sessions, the realization has been enforced that I have a deep seated need to connect with others more intimately than in my usual interactions. I don&#039;t know anyone I am comfortable asking to take MDMA with me. I was thinking about taking it at a festival of some sort. Is there any other kind of event or setting where it would be a fulfilling experience?

				Have you taken MDMA before?<br /><br />It seems.everyone responds individually to set and setting.<br /><br />Comfortable isolation can do more for yourself.than you might expect also. My first truly magical experience.was in comfortable isolation (recently) with Gelman&#039;s mdma. I was practically paralyzed with euphoria and empathy for a good 90 minutes before I was even capable of meaningful conversation. Extremely.therapeutic&nbsp; and introspective nevertheless. :)<br /><br />Everyone is different but I&#039;ve found that being active tends to subduethe magic.

				I have not, although I have taken 2c-i which many describe similar to rolling, and I felt a great amount of empathy and compassion when taking that alone. But I feel it would have been better to take with others. I felt the insights valuable, but I was ultimately unable to integrate them. I think actually interacting with others while on it would help.<br /><br />And I ask for MDMA and not 2c-i because there is just something I don&#039;t like about the stuff. I feel great when on it but not so great about the experience afterwards. Is MDMA different, can you tell me?

				I&#039;m here to chime in about solo MDMA experiences--they&#039;re awesome. I love taking MDMA when I&#039;m on my own. It&#039;s a great feeling that just lets me unwind and relax and feel good. I like to call up one of my friends and have a chat (somebody who doesn&#039;t know I&#039;m rolling) and it&#039;s usually a good experience.<br /><br /><br />Cheers!

But even with that recent solo roll, despite having a strong.desire to &quot;connect&quot;, I was very much content the entire time and being alone seemed to force alot of empathetic insight in lieu of anyones physical presence and that was a profound thing that I may not have experienced another setting.<br /><br />Ann Shulgin IIRC, said.something along the lines of &quot;3 mdma therapy sessions produces more.results than 6 yrs of therapy&quot;. <br />So there&#039;s lots to be gained even if you can&#039;t find your idealized setting at this particular moment.<br /><br />Interesting about your feelings toward 2cb.post trip. It&#039;s near the top of my bucketlist but shrooms produce something like you.describe for me these days so I stopped doing them. DMT.treated me.similarly so I&#039;ve lost interesr in that as.well. <br />With the exception of the NBOMEs, I&#039;ll probably include.an MDXX in some.future psych&nbsp; trips (NBOME has been good to me).<br />

				The reason why MDMA is my favourite is that it works in so many different situations. Whereas psychedelics can be a bit touch-and-go, depending on the setting/vibe/other people, MDMA for me has a kind of &#039;everything is awesome&#039; feeling that overrides any such considerations.<br /><br />Having said that, I would avoid taking it around a shitload of straight people in the daytime if possible- you&#039;ve gotta feel a little bit comfortable. But either at a festival, or by yourself, you&#039;re gonna have a really good time, mmmkayyyy?&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Festival would be my choice out of the two mind you. Try and make sure the music is danceable, and preferably soulful too&nbsp; 8)

				Firstly I want to say that 2C-I and psychedelics in general have never been really Euphoric or Empathetic for me at all. The only time I can think that was would be my first LSD trip. When I started getting visuals I was all, &#039;Holy fuck, this is actually working. Everyone needs to try this as it so fucking amazing. AND I BOUGHT THIS ONLINE! HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?!?!&#039; It was my first SR purchase as well :) 2C-B is meant to be a bit closer to rolling but I&#039;m yet to try it.<br /><br />As for actually rolling, I&#039;ve only done this once and it was alone. I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect or what I was going to feel like doing so I did a quick google search for ideas, headed down to the shops and picked up some Vicks, menthol cough lollies, glow sticks and a new towel (that was an impulse buy), got home and had a light meal, waited an hour then downed some vitamins (mainly anti-oxidants) and one of the caps I had. It was all waiting for the next hour, music and random net surfing till I felt something.<br /><br />Once it hit me it came on fast. I ended up just swapping to some heavy dubstep and pumping it as loud as I could and just going with it. I don&#039;t dance normally, even at clubs, and would normally feel stupid by myself, but I did that night anyway just because the simple act of moving felt amazing.<br /><br />After a couple of hours of that I just chilled, very euphoric still but spent some time pumping drum and base and thinking about things. Mainly friends and family and that. I did want to &#039;connect&#039; with them, but it was never overwhelming or enough to make me feel lonely. It was honestly really great and therapeutic without meaning to be.<br /><br />Moral of the story is there is nothing wrong with rolling alone. I personally think it&#039;s one of the best experiences I&#039;ve had in a long long time. Enjoy it mate :)

In fact, I&#039;ve found that quietly at home is so much nicer for me than at parties. Alone or just 1 or 2 close friends. For parties, coke or something is way more fun.

				Very interesting the replies I am getting. For me, 2c-i was quite empathetic, but it did feel like a waste to do alone. I read someone say that methylone is even better for chilling out at home than MDMA. Maybe I should try that. Maybe I should try both, but I just don&#039;t want to waste the magic of the first MDMA trip that many say you never fully recapture.
