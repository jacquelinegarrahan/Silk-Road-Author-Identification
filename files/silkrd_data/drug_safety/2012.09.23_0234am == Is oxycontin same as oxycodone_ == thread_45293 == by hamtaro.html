				I just took 8 x 5mg Oxycodone HCL (small round blue pills), and was feeling really good, had a nap, and woke up with a bit of nausea and feel really lightheaded, no good feelings however.<br /><br />I got 20 of these suckers for like $18.<br /><br />If they are the same, then boy, I think I rather smoke weed, don&#039;t know what all the rave is about.

				Oxycodone is the active ingredient in Oxycontin.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oxycontin is just a brand name given by Purdue Pharma for their time release oxycodone.<br /><br />The active ingredient in Percocet is also Oxycodone, in other words, oxycodone is the drug, oxycontin is the brand name.<br /><br />I&#039;ll gladly buy em off you if you don&#039;t want em :)

				Weed is obviously, objectively speaking the least harmful, least risky euphoria you can get from a drug. However, some people don&#039;t enjoy being baked out all the time it definitely effects the sharpness of your mental capacity (either a little bit or a whole lot depending on the individual and their tolerance). Opiates on the other hand (especially oxy), are euphoric and extremely functional and productive. That is the main difference, but no one&#039;s gonna argue with you about weed as far as avoiding addiction and avoiding bodily harm (other than the tar of the smoke) and still getting high, yeah nothing compares...

Opana is fuckin gnarly, I don&#039;t like it all because of the strength and dopiness. But to each his own I guess, but thats pretty weird. OXY/HYDRO - CODONE is the bomb to me (Perc/Vic), I strongly dislike the MORPHONE aka dilaudid and opana.

				Dlaudid (Hydromorphone) is the only one I hate, it gives me nausea as soon as I take it and doesn&#039;t really do the job.&nbsp; Any other opiate though and mmm mmm good, dunno why that is, but it caused my doc to switch my script from dilaudid to tylenol #3&#039;s of all things !!! He wouldn&#039;t even give me percs but he&#039;s give me dilaudid ..... lol.<br /><br />The reason some people don&#039;t enjoy opiates is because there&#039;s a range of slow to fast cytochrome P450 metabolizer&#039;s (eg. CYP3A4, CYP3D6, etc. etc. etc.) amongst a given race in a population, which roughly follows a bell curve.&nbsp; Slow metabolizer&#039;s will end up with an accumulation of the opiate and very slow metabolism into active metabolites that infer u-opioid induced &#039;euphoria&#039;, they will typically only feel the analgesic effects (treat the pain but not get you high).&nbsp; <br /><br />Fast metabolizer&#039;s will get high and less pain relief but they will need to redose much more frequently.&nbsp; Since it typically follows a bell curve like distribution most people fall under the same &#039;moderate&#039; metabolizer pharmacokinetics.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t &#039;enjoy&#039; them and feel sick/headache/nausea you are one of the 1-5% unlucky few whose liver cytochrome P450 enzyme system just isn&#039;t quite up to par in terms of metabolic rate.&nbsp; Most people fall into the center (bell curve) though, that&#039;s why you hear about many more people enjoying opiates for recreation then those that don&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /><br />Opiates were not designed for recreational &#039;euphoria&#039;, it&#039;s just an &#039;unfortunate&#039; (in medicine) side effect.&nbsp; They were actually designed to treat analgesia.&nbsp; Greedy practitioner&#039;s have for decades looked past their own responsibilities (to treat disease) for the profit to be had in distributing them because of the high demand for the euphoria SIDE-EFFECT of opiate&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that most will agree that the crap that went down in Florida before they finally created a centralized database is a prime example of how easy it is for those that care for us (Doctors) to be blinded by their own responsibilities when dollar signs are waiving in their face.<br /><br />Those saying weed is PHYSIOLOGICALLY safer then opiates are ... full of crap.&nbsp; Opiates are meant to treat chronic pain, and do so extraordinarily well with little to no PHYSIOLOGICAL damage, it&#039;s when people seek them out for their side-effect&#039;s (euphoria) illicitly that excessive use occurs and physiological damage can occur (though it&#039;s still fairly rare).&nbsp; PSYCHOLOGICALLY, however, opiates are far more dangerous in terms of addiction and relapse, mostly due to misuse.&nbsp; But on the same note weed is not even remotely as close to treating chronic analgesia as opiates are.&nbsp; It&#039;s true that weed has pronounced effectiveness over opiates on a few dozen chronic pain related diseases, but opiates have a pronounced effectiveness on a few THOUSAND chronic pain related diseases.<br /><br />It&#039;s the RESPONSIBILITY of both the Practitioner and the Patient to use Opiates (and weed) appropriate to their condition that dictates the risks and dangers associated with Opiates.&nbsp; You don&#039;t blame the drug, you blame the person intentionally misusing the drug for recreation to acheive one of it&#039;s SIDE-EFFECTS.<br /><br />

				^Droppin some knowledge in that post. DEfinitely true about its only 5% or less of people don;t experience the ephoric &quot;side-effect&quot; hah. I would say THC and Rx opioids are pretty much equally safe, the con of weed health wise is the smoke, and maybe some mental health stuff. As for opiates, its basically just the physical addiction thing, but thats such a big one. Nevertheless, neither are harmful to your body on occasion, besides from the smoking part of smoking weed hah. When I had a grip of Vics after one of my many shoulder dislocations I ate some brownies with like 15-20mg of hydro, DA BOMB! hah

				Everyone reacts differently to different drugs. I have a couple friends who love opiates, and recently tried heroin. They say it&#039;s the best thing ever, and I fear they&#039;re heading down a dark road.<br /><br />I myself used heroin frequently for a year or so, but eventually stopped. I greatly enjoyed the nod, and shooting it gave a nice rush, but it paled in comparison the feelings I got from smoking pot or the rush I got from taking MDMA. Plus, it occasionally made me throw up for hours at a time. It&#039;s just not for everyone.<br /><br />

				&quot;The two primary and almost 90% of perceived pain is due to inflammation and anxiety.&quot;<br /><br />Saying that you are overstating the case there would be way too nice of a way of putting it. That is an obnoxious claim. I would replace &#039;90% of perceived pain&#039; with &#039;the majority of very mild pain that people commonly experience&#039; (headaches, stomach aches, tooth aches, mild soreness) and yes some of those minor ailments can be caused or exacerbated by anxiety that creates psycho-somatic pain.&nbsp; But anyone who has experienced moderate to severe pain from actual physical injury knows that NSAIDs are a joke in treating that type of pain, which is why prescription opioids exist... and are used so frequently.

That is an obnoxious claim. I would replace &#039;90% of perceived pain&#039; with &#039;the majority of very mild pain that people commonly experience&#039; (headaches, stomach aches, tooth aches, mild soreness) and yes some of those minor ailments can be caused or exacerbated by anxiety that creates psycho-somatic pain.&nbsp; But anyone who has experienced moderate to severe pain from actual physical injury knows that NSAIDs are a joke in treating that type of pain, which is why prescription opioids exist... and are used so frequently. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi Bob; <br />Yup, I have to agree with you.&nbsp; That is a pretty far out claim although the sentence doesn&#039;t really make sense.&nbsp; He seems to be forgetting about simple nerve endings responding to stimuli.&nbsp; That&#039;s one of our bodies built in protection mechanism. When we touch a hot stove we aren&#039;t responding to inflammation and anxiety.&nbsp; We are simply responding to our bodies protection mechanism, pain from nerve endings.&nbsp; If we had to wait for inflammation, or anxiety before we responded to pain everyone would be walking around with broken bones, burns and all kinds of injuries! Thing is that wasn&#039;t my quote.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; &nbsp;Just wanted to point that out. I think that came from that quinone fellow, not me
