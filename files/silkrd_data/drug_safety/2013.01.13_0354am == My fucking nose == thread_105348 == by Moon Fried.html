When my nose starts burning this much I know it&#039;s time to take a time out. It&#039;s not horrifying pain, more like a nuisance to deal with. If I just ignore it then there isn&#039;t much of a problem.<br /><br />Thanks for all of the tips. I might try some of your ideas, or just wait it out. Doesn&#039;t take long to recover from my past experience with this.

				If it hurts ... stop doing it.<br /><br />You&#039;ve burned your nose and possibly the mucosa internally and above your nostrils.&nbsp; So you should firstly stop snorting anything until the flesh in your nose has had time to heal, at least a week or two.<br /><br />Second you should research whether or not you even need to snort the drug your snorting, in this case MXE.&nbsp; Many drugs have higher bioavailability when just taken orally and many just snort them because they&#039;re convinced it&#039;s the norm,&nbsp; or the &#039;real man&#039;s&#039; way of doing a drug.&nbsp; Reality is that half the drugs people snort (and MXE is one of them) are more active and definitely last longer if taken orally.<br /><br />You&#039;ll also find 10 years down the road permanent and ugly disfiguring nostril damage if you snort drugs that have more absorbed when taken orally anyways.&nbsp; It may be true that snorting with many (BUT NOT ALL) will give you a higher rush for a very brief period, but then only keep you high for a fraction of the time then if you had put it into a small piece of paper, folded it over and swallowed it.<br /><br />If you INSIST that you need to snort your drug for it to be absorbed by your mucous membranes then I suggest again you give your nose a break until its fully healed and dissolve the drug in water/solvent and squirt into your rectum with a syringe.&nbsp; The lining of your anus has more mucous membranes then your nose does anyways so .... plugging which I think ppl call it is how you should do it until you let your nose heal.<br /><br />Treat your body like a temple and let your nose heal before going back and damaging it again.&nbsp; This may mean abstaining altogether for a bit (why are you taking MXE every day if you don&#039;t mind my asking, that&#039;s excessive), eat it (in a small piece of paper or just eat it like a man, just chemical taste), or &#039;plug it&#039;.&nbsp; But don&#039;t keep causing further damage to your nose if it&#039;s hurting like you describe, this will lead to permanent damage .... just respect your body please :(

				I have a notoriously bad nose.&nbsp; It takes like pretty much nothing for it to get irritated.&nbsp; If I smoke, like 1 or 2 hits of weed, my nose will be stuffy and itchy for like a week.&nbsp; (This hasn&#039;t stopped me from smoking daily though ;-))&nbsp; So when I snort a drug, I know that I&#039;m asking for a world of trouble with regards to my nose.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found that using saline mist spray regularly helps a ton to alleviate nasal irritation due to insufflation.&nbsp; What I usually do is use the saline spray to irrigate my nose (like a neti pot) by squirting in one nostril and letting it run out the other.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do that, wait 5 minutes, blow my nose, then give each nostril a spray to moisturize them.&nbsp; Then I&#039;ll sniff the drugs into my nose and let them chill for a minute.&nbsp; Then I&#039;ll do another spray in each nostril to re-moisturize them.&nbsp; Wait about 10 minutes, spray again.&nbsp; Spray like every 5 minutes after that, and then after about 45 minutes, I will flush my nose out again and blow my nose and then keep moisturizing a few times an hour.<br /><br />If I don&#039;t use any saline, and just sniff and move on with my day, my nose gets completely congested to where I can&#039;t breathe through it at all, and will stay that way sometimes for days afterwards.&nbsp; To the point where it&#039;s so uncomfortable that the experience with the drug is killed.&nbsp; When I do use the saline like I described, I get very little discomfort, and while it&#039;s a lot of work (I need to be at home pretty much, with a sink available and some privacy), it&#039;s well worth it to avoid&nbsp; the problems.<br /><br />I hope you take the saline advice and it helps to prevent the discomfort.

				There are vendors of lidocaine on here.&nbsp; If not lidocraine there are vendor&#039;s of several other local anesthetics.&nbsp; Just put a sprinkle of it in your mix of lines you plan on taking and, though you&#039;ll still be harming the sensitive tissue in your nose you won&#039;t feel any pain at all.<br /><br />I believe it was first added to &#039;ivory wave&#039;, the brand name for MDPV because that stuff doesn&#039;t just cause pain, it does so because it&#039;s VERY CAUSTIC and directly causes damage to soft tissue, I don&#039;t believe theres a drug that causes more pain and lidocaine being a local anesthetic will mask the fact that your freely damaging your own body :(.<br /><br />If this is your usual method of using MXE and you don&#039;t plan on stopping you should consider adding a local anesthetic, the complete lack of pain would probably alter the trip.&nbsp; I only say this cuz when I tried MXE it was ... well MXE, when friends were talking I was tripping n whatnot, but when I went on my own for a bit, then I was REALLY TRIPPING, a melting universe of strangeness ... yes perfect clarity.&nbsp; A very interesting drug i&#039;ll give it that, not really on my personal list of favorite psychedelics though, but I can see for sure why many, like yourself i&#039;m assuming would love it.&nbsp; <br /><br />It definitely does it&#039;s job at taking you on your journey of the night.&nbsp; By comparison I like ketamine a whole lot more, but if you like MXE more that&#039;s great, as long as you find the one that YOU like better cuz its YOUR TRIP :).<br /><br />I took it orally when I did so, and pretty sure I took a hero dose or close (i&#039;d taken 2C-E didn&#039;t get high one bit, but i&#039;m on an SNRI so I knew it would be 50/50 if I would or not.&nbsp; At any rate I was raving mad that this meant basically all the 2C&#039;s are out for me until I stop taking anti-depresssants ..... which I will never ever stop taking).<br /><br />The 2C-E had done SOMETHING to me though even though I wasn&#039;t really high off it, cuz I am a person who would NEVER EVER take a drug without balancing it, balancing it again, and then triple weighing.&nbsp; Only once is necessary, it&#039;s just old habit&#039;s of measuring in a lab.&nbsp; But with this MXE I was just so pissed I guess I said fuck this and eyeballed what looked like a very healthy dose into that piece of paper.&nbsp; Never really did find out, but im guessing at the very lowest 250mg, but probably btwn 300-400mg (i&#039;m a small guy).&nbsp; I might like it if I give it another shot one of these day&#039;s under more ... controlled circumstances.<br /><br />Not sayin it&#039;s a bad psych/dissociative, I just wasn&#039;t responsible with my preparation to take it, and also had 2C-E in me, regardless of if that helped or changed anything.&nbsp; Weird thing I don&#039;t get is I dunno how i&#039;d have snorted the MXE I had very easily had I wanted to snort it.&nbsp; It was a very &#039;wet&#039; consistency, but I guess thinking about it it wouldn&#039;t have been hard if I wanted to snort it, oral is fine though.<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided not to snort any drug unless there is some explicit reason to snort it, most drugs work better for me when I just eat them anyways (like coke and H would be exceptions but i&#039;ve never done ether).&nbsp; This is just a personal decision cuz the experiences were too similar to waste my own time snorting then dealing with pain that&#039;ll come with just about every drug (cept coke of course), so pls don&#039;t think i&#039;m lecturing you.<br /><br />Just lookin out for a fellow bro, but yes your best bet like I said would be to put some local anesthetic in it before you make a line, it might hurt for .... 5 seconds, but then you could probably snort drano ... if you wanted to :D.<br /><br />Only &#039;lecture&#039; I want to give you is if you did hurt the tissue in your nose to that point and are having to pick out scabby bloody dead tissue, I really think you should keep your nose away from having ANYTHING put up it for about a week.&nbsp; Only say so cuz it deserves time to heal and you&#039;ll be less likely to do permanent damage to yourself.&nbsp; Sometimes parts of your body just need a break to heal :).&nbsp; That and if the wound was open at all, snorting while still wounded would increase your risk of picking up an infection, and your doc would be busting your balls hard about snorting exotic drugs (he&#039;ll know its not H or coke, they dont&#039;t do the types of caustic damage MXE does).<br /><br />Anyways, sorry dude I mean like nothing personal to you at all, take your drugs however you choose, just for all our sakes just be safe about it, we all care about you bro, and each other :).<br /><br />Least I got high that night though, fucking SNRI has killed every drug from working and I miss in particular that I can&#039;t roll on MDMA anymore :( :(
