				Hey everyone, I&#039;m sure this was asked and answered already on this forum but I don&#039;t have the mindset and energy to dig and search. Well, the problem is I have been doing XTC pills from AIH for 5 days continuous (almost 10-15pills), and now I have been feeling nausea, puking, glittered vision for the 3rd day in row, nightmares when I sleep, this is just unbelievable. <br /><br />Could anyone please please please guide me to how to get rid of this symptoms and help me get back to normal?

				Take at least 3 grams of vitamin C per day, and 500mg of B3 as niacinamide. Eat as much fruit as you can. Chlorella or spirulina if you can find them.<br /><br />Hopefully you learned your lesson.

				I have had rougher days when i was younger, the only thing you can do is, drink and sleep. When your tingly, weak, glittered vision, vomit when you smell food, you just need your sleep and fluids.<br /><br />Goodluck.

				XTC, is that just slang for &quot;unknown rolly drug&quot; or is that a smartshop product?<br /><br />I&#039;m okay with glitter vision anymore.&nbsp; It&#039;s weird when I&#039;m sad or angry, everything&#039;s still really pretty and I end up losing my sad/angry train of though.<br /><br />That other stuff sounds wretched.<br /><br />I just got over a 3 weekend binger of Methylone.&nbsp; IV&#039;d anywhere from 3-10 grams a day.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing with my life, but I&#039;m probably radioactive at this point.<br /><br />Hey, wanna start a club?<br /><br />~Ali
