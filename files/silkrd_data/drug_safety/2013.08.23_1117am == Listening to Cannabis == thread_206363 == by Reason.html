				I originally posted this as a reply to someone whom was having a bad relatinship with Cannabis.&nbsp; I too have had times when I didn&#039;t enjoy the experience.&nbsp; However, at this point in my life I think I&#039;ve refined my understanding of how best to use the substance, and figured it&#039;d be nice to share my thoughts.<br /><br />Like all drugs, you must try to control for many variables to optimize the positive effects and minimize the negative.<br /><br />So here is my &quot;Listening to Cannabis&quot; post.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />1) Firstly you must try to eliminate intake of any non psychoactive compounds.&nbsp; The best means of doing this is by using a vaporizer,&nbsp; and grinding the herb well.&nbsp; Ingesting edibles also works, but that takes much more product, and is more of a time commitment. <br /><br />2) Carefully measure the amount you use, start small, and take note of the amount.&nbsp; For somoene that&#039;s been off for a long while, I&#039;d recommend using something like 1/8th of a teasoon for one session.&nbsp; Finding a means of measuring such small amounts is challenging.&nbsp; I cut about 1/4&quot; tip off of a bicycle tire air cap as a reasonable measuring tool for this purpose. <br /><br />3) Carefully control the temperature of the vaporizer, and take note of it, as this will come into play as to what effect takes place.&nbsp; A good vaporizer will provide you with this information.&nbsp; Higher temperatures release more CBD type compounds, lower just THC.&nbsp; Both have a role in the effect.&nbsp; I generally use around 375 degrees.<br /><br />4) Try a variety of situations/settings, and also take note of your initial mental state before you begin your session.&nbsp; For example, try sitting around and watching TV, while vaping.&nbsp; Try playing video games.&nbsp; Try hanging with friends.&nbsp; Being outside, listeing to music, reading.&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; I find some strains are more amenable to some activities vs others.&nbsp; If you start with an agitated state of mind, it&#039;s probably not going to get much better with Cannabis.&nbsp; I actually find meditation is very beneficial prior to using Cannabis to start with a centered state of mind.<br /><br />Finally, after doing an initial set of experiments, adjust these variables, and note the effect.&nbsp; You&#039;ll almost certainly be able to zero in on an optimal means of enjoying the experience.<br /><br />Note that when you get a new strain, you may need to do some of these again.&nbsp; It&#039;s fun actually! <br /><br />By doing this, I&#039;ve been able to minimize the anxiety/paranoia effects and maximize the relaxing, invigorating effects I want.<br /><br />I only wish I had access to a wide variety of strains at all times (it&#039;d make it so much easier to zero in on the strain that works for me). <br /><br />So, how do you maximize your enjoyment of Cannabis?&nbsp; Share your thoughts &amp; ideas!<br /><br />Cheers!!

				Thanks CricketPlank! <br /><br />Well...I&#039;m still searching for an ideal strain for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m also starting to realize that some strains are best for certain situations.<br /><br />For example, the common wisdom is that the Indica strains are more of a &quot;body&quot; high, and the Sativa strains are more of a &quot;Head&quot; high.&nbsp; However I&#039;ve found this vague guidance only somewhat useful.&nbsp; <br /><br />I generally use Cannabis once a day.&nbsp; After a long day at work, my objective is to have some Cannabis to unwind and relax, but on weekends I might want it for use with watching a movie or being outside, or socializing.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I started my search with the intent of finding a good &quot;relaxing&quot; straing, and got some Girl Scout Cookies, as I thought this was an Indica Dominant.&nbsp; Yikes was I wrong!&nbsp; I initially used way too much and it got my heart racing, and got me agitated (not relaxing in other words).&nbsp; I later read that it was actually heavier in Sativa.&nbsp; Happily&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that by adjusting the dose, and using the vaporizer...it was a great strain while enjoying the company of others, and really helped me be creative.&nbsp; <br /><br />I then tried some Bubble Kush, most certainly Indica heavy.&nbsp; It turned me into a zombie (metaphorically).&nbsp; It was just too much &quot;couch lock&quot;.&nbsp; I want to relax, not become immobile!&nbsp; I also found that it gave me a horrible &quot;fuzzy&quot; head the next day too, which is no good in my line of work.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use it often now, but can imagine some situations where it might be useful.<br /><br />So, at this point I&#039;m assuming that I am more of a Sativa guy, and most recently am working with Silver Sour Diesel.&nbsp; I have to say, I really love this stuff.&nbsp; It does provide a really nice body tingle, but does not immobilize me, and I&#039;m still able to be fully functional (presuming I watch the dose).<br /><br />I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that almost every strain, as is the case with all the women I&#039;ve known and loved, have their own charms....but you must be mindful in order to appreciate their beauty.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />R. <br /><br />PS.&nbsp; Eternal thanks SR and DPR...whom have enabled me to embark on my search.

				This is a post that keeps me on the road - not that all the other drug safety and curiosities are less beneficial for people, this is just really relevant to me.<br /><br />hadn&#039;t smoked in many years prior to finding the Road. Expected to just buy some LSD but then i realised that the road offers the whole library of strains of marijuana that wouldn&#039;t necessarily onset the problems i&#039;ve experienced in the past.<br />tried these strains since I arrived here, with brief synopsis of my experiences:<br /><br />- unkown sativa from domestic supplier. he also supplied afghan kush, perhaps this was similar. extremely smelly and seemed to lose quality quickly over a few months of good storage. experience was terrible, but it was my first and set and setting was very immature of me so i don&#039;t want to say it was the plants fault (of course)<br /><br />- BioCanna&#039;s sensimilla - high CBD indica - this just fucking floors me and i have to go to bed, where i trip a bit and do therapy until i eventually go to sleep. &quot;heavy hitting&quot; as they say. don&#039;t think it&#039;s for me either<br /><br />- Lightning Bud&#039;s NLX AAA - again my idea was to get indicas so as to minimise psychoactive effects - i didn&#039;t try this strain by itself so i won&#039;t comment on it really<br />- Lightning Bud&#039;s charas - this was where i started using a new pipe and this hash reminded me of joy. I did not experience the paranoia or stress that i did from the others - a breakthrough<br /><br />- caramello from a big german vendour whose name eludes me - strongest i&#039;ve smoked, melted in pipe. good set and setting so ended up being a great experience, but i tripped out for about half an hour before being able to move and i don&#039;t remember any of what happened - unfortunately this isn&#039;t something i can repeat frequently.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to slant this post towards an analysis of different strains, but I am writing here to continue with your point - I too am looking for &quot;the right strains&quot; or what can work for me, and agree with you that I have to keep doses very low, and also that I really need to minimise side effects. So far the charas was my finest experience with less side effects, but some of the grasses really had strong side effects that i can&#039;t afford &quot;in my line of work&quot;. <br /><br />The most important thing I learned in these experiences was that it is possible to work with the great spirit of the mother marijuana - great sativa - without succumbing to addiction and the darkness of the surrounding culture. but strain and clarity of the chain of dealing is important too, another reason to buy direct from growers.<br /><br />

				One time I didn&#039;t smoke for two weeks and then I smoked some earwax right off the bat. Lol that was the trippiest experience I had ever had with thc. It certainly made my heart race and was uncomfortable for a few minutes. Then I fell asleep!

				Oddly enough, I&#039;ve tried multiple strains of cannabis and none have ever settled well with me. They either make me feel sleepy and retarded (indica), or strange and paranoid (sativa). Does anyone else just not &quot;get&quot; cannabis? Of all the countless drugs I&#039;ve consumed, it&#039;s the one I&#039;m least likely to ever do again next to salvia (such a crap psychedelic in comparison to pretty much every other psych out there)
