				Gotta agree with The Scientist on this one ^. The museum of natural history sounds like a fun place to trip, but probably not for your first time. Try it in a secure environment first and see how you react to it. Then if you like it, venture out in public places.<br /><br />I&#039;d also keep the dosage light for your first trip. Try one dose and see how you like it before you really dive in. LSD isn&#039;t just about visuals. It also really fucks with your head. Its a good idea to test the water first.<br /><br />
