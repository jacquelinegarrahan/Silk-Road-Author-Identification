				Hi , I have tried other psychadelics such as Mushrooms and 2CB and I&#039;m really excited to try LSD.<br />I have a couple of questions and if anyone could answer them I would really appreciate it.<br /><br />1) What is the proper way to take the blotter?<br />2) I was just curious about these LSD Families I keep reading about.. What are they?<br />3) For my first trip (I plan on getting Tony tabs) How many hits should I take?<br />Thanks :)

				Hey Sus, I&#039;ll try to answer your questions to the best of my ability!<br />1) there are many ways, no &#039;proper&#039; way as such. A popular way is sublingually, but I just chew it up for ten minutes and swallow.<br />2) no idea.<br />3) between 100-250ug for your first trip, as you&#039;ve tripped before you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Enjoy :)

				@12345 it may have been because I ate a slice of pizza right before, but my first trip was 120ug and I felt little if nothing, ah well I guess it varies person to person.

				Q -<br />1) What is the proper way to take the blotter?<br />2) I was just curious about these LSD Families I keep reading about.. What are they?<br />3) For my first trip (I plan on getting Tony tabs) How many hits should I take?<br /><br />A -<br />1) Take the blotter/blotters in your mouth and swoosh them around for about 30 seconds, chew on them a little bit and then swallow. Seems to work for me anyway!<br />2) Family = Creators<br />3) I took 300ug my first dose, I&#039;d recommend at least the same. I also would recommend you try my LSD. ;)

I really have no idea what dosage it was. It was def. enough and I was not prepared what happened to me. Damn I was in the teens and it frightens the shit out of me.<br /><br />Some days later someone gave me my first ten strip of &quot;miraculix&quot; (very popular blotter art at this time, &quot;simpsons&quot;, &quot;miraculix&quot;, &quot;hoffmans&quot; and micros of cause) <br />One if these gave me my first full LSD trip ever, I mean that kind of trip, afterwards NOTHING seems to be normal again, ever. Trees never looked the same, stopped believing in god bc I knew there is something way bigger than everything, and no stupid religion can explain me this, ever. And last but not least I knew for sure, this is not a drug in the common sense.<br /><br />I was in love from this point on.

				first time i did acid i thought they were duds. did one sublingually, then chewed it up n swallowed it - nothing. repeated this every half hour until i did 5 of them. didn&#039;t feel shit all night, just carried on smoking joints. next day i went to the guy who sold me em and moaned about it, he said &#039;dunno what you&#039;re talking about mate, they&#039;re pretty potent&#039; and give us another one to prove it. he said &#039;knock a beer back before/during or after you do it&#039; and he was right - i needed a beer to kick start it and just the one was an amazing trip. i dunno the ug but if i had a beer the night before i would have been proper fucked up.<br /><br />so if you don&#039;t start tripping off one have a beer, must loosen up your brain to make it more receptive or something
