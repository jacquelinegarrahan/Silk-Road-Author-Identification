				Ok so I ordered 5 grams of 25i freebase from a vendor away from SR and need to convert it into a salt in order for it to be active sublingually to be laid onto blotter. I understand the process and I am mid process but half of my freebase is not being disolved into the solvent. I used 151 proof everclear vodka as a solvent and half dissolved then when I added the hydrochloric acid to the solvent I definitely noticed a change due to an amount of the freebase turning into HCL salt and dissolving better in the alcohol/water because HCL salt dissolves a lot easier. But what I don&#039;t understand is why half of it didn&#039;t dissolve into the solvent. I added probably about 4 shots of everclear to dissolve it and it just won&#039;t mix in. I am just confused, most cutting agents would&nbsp; still dissolve regardless but this vendor is really reputable so I can only assume its not cut. So why would only half my freebase dissolve in the solvent? Any suggestions? My PH is reading neutral now as well. Any help would be appreciated an if you are the one that helps me figure this out I will send you free 25i lol thanks all<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				I&#039;m not familiar with doing this but it leads me to use my basic chemistry principles. You just need more liquid. The solution is already super saturated so it can not disolve any more. Its like putting a bunch of salt into warm water and you put too much so it doesnt all disolve

				Try industrial grade ethaniol much much less water, or get DRY acetone , (cooking salts in oven for two hours)

				as mentioned the solution may be saturated and you may need more alcohol to get it to dissolve<br /><br />but since the solution is reading neutral, my guess is that all the available acid already reacted and that is the left over freebase which is still unreacted<br /><br />did you try adding a bit more acid dropwise to see if that would get a bit more to dissolve as long as the pH is still neutral you are probably near the pI and then after its all reacted as it gets further from the pI the pH will begin to drop much more rapidly and you need to get about a couple pH points lower than that to ensure complete conversion if i remember my chem correctly

				Science worked!! I figured that 175 mL of solvent would be enough, weird thing is when more of the freebase disolved in the solvent it is now reading as more acidic which doesn&#039;t make much sense to me but luckily thats an easy fix :) Thanks so much you guys HUGE life saver!! if any of you want a 10 strip PM me within the next few days and I will send you my PGP key if you wanna encrypt your address. I don&#039;t get on often but I&#039;ll check lots over the next few days cuz you guys helped out tons. +1 to you all!! lol thanks again!! :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper
