				Hi all<br /><br />I&#039;m suffering of a severe social anxiety and I tried almost everything in order to cure myself, without success. One of my shrink even told me it was somewhat incurable. Then one day I watched the TV series called &quot;Drugs Inc.&quot; and in the episode about hallucinogens, they said LSD was used successfully by psychiatrist in the past. And I recently found a PDF mentioning it too. It seems that LSD can change the way you see the world. It&#039;s may be an opportunity to finish this up once and for all.<br /><br />I would like to know if some of you have ever been in the same situation and if LSD had a successfully effect on you.<br /><br />Also, I wonder if LSD evaporates ? as I could probably not take it immediately after receiving it (still live with my parents) and it could take several weeks before I take it.<br /><br />And finally, any LSD seller with good reviews delivering in EU ?<br /><br />Thanks for all.

				MDMA is better for social anxiety...<br /><br />from personal experience...being fried in the presence of strangers can be quite uncomfortable...however if you take the LSD in a controlled environment under the supervision of a therapist or a trusted friend you might be able to reach some solutions concerning your social anxiety...

				I developed social anxiety after years of being a depressed Heroin addict. Your social anxiety goes hand-in-hand with depression. Right? LSD will probably not help you in social situations while you are actually tripping. However, LSD has been extremely helpful in treating my depression which in turn has reduced my social anxiety. I use LSD every other week or so and it has been a wonderful tool for reducing my depression and social anxiety everyday.<br />You may want to look into Beta-Blockers for anxiety when you know you will have a social engagement. I intend on trying this in a few weeks.

				LSD with bad social anxiety sounds like a nightmare and not something that would cure it.<br /><br />MDMA has opened me up a bit, my social anxiety is not nearly as bad as it used to be with some semi-regular (~1month between rolls) use.

				I&#039;ve suffered from some social anxiety and LSD has helped to an extent.&nbsp; I attributed LSD to helping rid me of my fear of dancing in public and basically acting &#039;myself&#039; while in public scenarios (rather than a loner standing on the wall). The half-life on LSD is something like 50-100 years, so it will absolutely last for as long as you need it to.&nbsp; I would highly recommend giving it a shot, but make sure to do a bit of homework.

				I get what you&#039;re trying to do. I have severe social anxiety as well. Both LSD and Shrooms actually helped me figure out what was the root cause of my anxiety then I could work on resolving that therefore reducing the anxiety. In 6 months or so, with the help of LSD/Shrooms, I worked through about 12 years of pure rage. It does help but it takes a real strong mind-set to get through the difficulties of tripping. Tripping really takes a lot out of you, physical and mental energy. My suggestion, do whatever you want to do but with a person you trust completely and isolate yourself from people that you don&#039;t want to be around while tripping.&nbsp;

				I think MDMA may not be such a good idea, as although you feel loving, social and open while on it, you may find the comedown in the week after using pushes you further into social anxiety. The same with other stimulants, but light use of pharmaceutical amphetamines may help. <br /><br />I suggest microdosing just once, to see how it goes. This is where you take a dose of 8-15ug.<br />Or take a high dose trip alone where you realize how much human contact means to you, and when your sober you will hopefully find positive after effects.<br /><br />For good LSD I recommend Fartbomber and Jesus of Rave.

Well, during this time i discovered shrooms, and easily tripped over 80+ times in the span of 1 1/2 year. I discovered and learned many many things about myself.

				I&#039;m in a similar situation. I have suffered from social anxiety since I was 11 or so. I&#039;m nervous in pretty much every interaction with people I don&#039;t know very well (and there aren&#039;t many people I know very well!) unless the interaction is formal. I live on a dorm with a couple other students and I actually avoid going into the kitchen when someone else is already there, because I&#039;m afraid of talking to them and possibly making a fool out of myself. I go to university, but I have no friends there because I never managed to make any since I started. On top of that I have a pretty bad case of Paruresis (shy bladder), meaning I can&#039;t pee when others are nearby. Paruresis is not a conscious fear, I feel relaxed at that moment, but my bladder is on lockdown (I believe my brain thinks other people are a threat). I have seen a psychologist, but really all he could do was give me pointers and he had never even heard of paruresis before. <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in trying LSD to see if it might help me. I&#039;m a very introverted person so I want to try it alone, would that be a bad idea? I don&#039;t know anyone else that would want to try it and I fear a sober sitter might mess up my trip or distract me too much. The only experience I have with drugs is weed, I smoke a lot (pretty much daily although I kinda want to cut back on that) and sometimes I make edibles. I consider myself to be a fairly stable person. I&#039;ve only had one panic attack due to weed and that&#039;s because I made the mistake of smoking while I was very upset, but even then I was able to calm myself down relatively easily. I&#039;ve had very strong edibles without any issues and the strong effects of alcohol+weed are no issue for me either. I guess my biggest worry is forgetting that I am tripping and doing stupid things as a result. Is this common? As long as I remember I&#039;m tripping I&#039;m 100% sure I&#039;ll be okay, assuming nothing crazy happens like a fire in the building (lol). I would be tripping in my room with the door locked and an almost non-existent chance of being interrupted. I would turn off my phone and also make enough food for the entire day beforehand. Then I would spend the entire day thinking, writing things down, listening to music, maybe watching a movie, such things.<br /><br />With LSD, I&#039;m hoping to explore my subconscious and get rid of my &quot;demons&quot;. I know my social anxiety and paruresis are both irrational fears/problems, but my subconscious doesn&#039;t (hence why the problems still exist). I don&#039;t expect to be cured immediately, of course, but if I can get my subconscious to eliminate or reduce my fear of other people it might help me on the way to recovery. Is this something that could be achieved with LSD or am I talking nonsense? I do a lot of thinking when I&#039;m alone and I find it helps me understand myself better. Smoking weed often gives me a different perspective on things and many minor epiphanies (on a conscious level), I can only imagine what LSD could do for me. :)

				I hate the term &quot;social anxiety&quot;, just another bullshit diagnosis for big pharma to exploit people. That said I was in this same boat for quite a few years, I can definitely say Psychedelics have helped. The thing is you need to manage your expectations, they will push you in the right direction but you have to be willing to put the effort in.<br /><br />I spent months tripping at any given opportunity searching for that magical revelation everyone talks about, but really it was just me running away. I had already learned what I needed to learn, but things didn&#039;t actually start turning around until I got off my ass and did something about it.

				I agree with everything above. Stay away from becoming involved in the psychiatric medical system - you don&#039;t need it, you don&#039;t want it and they have a poor success rate. If you&#039;re looking to change the way you think and want to perceive the world differently then LSD is probably the most effective method for most people. <br /><br />I started using LSD 6 months ago and have gone on about 20 fairly powerful trips since then. Usually I add in some weed and sometimes I treat myself to nitrous so I can really take off. I get totally wasted - but I always feel I am in full control. I&#039;m not going to run outside naked and start eating people. You are fully in control of your actions and your common sense remains intact. I often trip alone but if it gets too intense make sure you can watch tv or play computer games for a while. Sitcoms are great to watch. Playing Battlefield 3 online I struggle to remember what the hell I&#039;m doing, it&#039;s hard as hell but great fun as well. <br /><br />Here&#039;s what you can expect. Place the LSD under your tongue for at least 15 minutes, then swallow it. As the effects come in about 60 to 90 minutes later it starts to feel like you&#039;re a bit stoned. You may feel a little nausea the first few times but it passes after 10-20 minutes. Your may start to feel hot as your body ramps up and it can be tricky to not get too hot or cold but your temperature should stabilize after about 2 hours. Your short term memory will go, setting up equipment like game consoles or even turning on the tv becomes hard to work out how to do it. You will regularly forget what you are doing, and if you take enough you may forgot what you are. You remember your name but you just feel like a pair of eyes floating in the universe - I think this is the ego death. The intensity of LSD comes and goes in waves. You&#039;ll feel a few peaks - just relax and focus on breathing. <br /><br />If you stare at carpet, the roof, gravel or anything with a regular texture or pattern you will start to see it shimmer. The flat surface may appear to have depth. I remember the carpet looking like it was the ocean as viewed from above. You can also see finely intricate fractal patterns, regular patterns like grids, waves, spheres all with a 3d effect on many surfaces. Text on the screen looks like it is bubbling and jiggling around - but you can still read. Your 3d perception goes a bit wonky so objects may look out of proportion or warped. Close your eyes and your imagination produces strange images, pictures, some with motion that warp into each and make little sense. The things you can visualize are much more detailed, bigger and better than what you can imagine sober. <br /><br />If you are thinking about a problem in real life you can visualize it in your mind - you can see it represented visually in a way you never could before. You have epiphanies and gain major insights - how things look from others&#039; point of view, how relevant something really isn&#039;t, how parts of our society mesh together. It may appear gibberish the next day but some of it sticks. You&#039;ll feel very awake and alert - sleep will be impossible until about 15 hours later and you&#039;ll still be buzzing a bit then. It&#039;s nice to try activities like gardening, cooking, cleaning while high - well if you have any chores doing them high is much more fun.<br /><br />Strangely I find alcohol loses its appeal while on LSD, hard to explain but I can see why they&#039;d treat alcoholics with it. It does make me want to cut down on my drinking.<br /><br />Afterwards you feel like you&#039;re brain has had a reboot - a fresh restart now you&#039;re armed with some interesting insights. There&#039;s no hangover. You may feel a buzz taste in your mouth the next day or not. I almost permanently have a faint one now but am not bothered by it at all - nor am I sure if it&#039;s due to LSD. A minor side effect for what I have gained. It makes me want to try to do better where I work - I&#039;ve come up with some good ideas on LSD. I firmly believe flashbacks are a myth but HPPD is real, fortunately HPPD effects pass over time if you stop taking it. <br /><br />Also if you&#039;re a bit freaked out in life I recommend taking a low dose of fluoxetine (Prozac). I&#039;ve taken it for the past 10 years after curiosity got to me and I bought some online. It gives you a bit more energy and oomph and lets you think more objectively without being so influenced by emotions. Could be worth a try.

				if you do have social anxiety, and don&#039;t have friends your completely comfortable tripping around, by all means trip solo.&nbsp; as a newbie psychonaut, i once made the mistake of taking a huge trip at a trap house, around people i didn&#039;t know too well, in a very bad part of town.<br /><br />let me tell you, i still hear stories to this day about that day.&nbsp; although horror, that &#039;bad trip&#039; set me more free than anything else i experienced, i lost myself in front of a crowd.&nbsp; i suggest the first trip be solo in your situation, about 200 mics as a good strong intro dose. <br /><br />i honestly don&#039;t think lsd will help with social anxiety on a immediate level, however it will open you up to answers on why you do experience this anxiety, allowing for very therapeutic self reflection.

				Really interesting thread!<br /><br />Regarding storing it, we assume it&#039;ll be on blotter?&nbsp; Just put it in a cool (room temp is probably fine), dark, moisture-free environment, as the enemies of compound stability are heat, light, and dampness.&nbsp; Acid has a reputation for being a little more prone to losing its potency than most other drugs, but several weeks isn&#039;t going to be a problem at all.&nbsp; A lot of people just wrap it in some tinfoil and put it in a box or something and put that in a drawer.&nbsp; There are those who think it should be in the fridge or the freezer, but we&#039;ve always wondered if the risk of moisture -- even if it&#039;s wrapped in tinfoil and in an outer bag or something -- make this more or less effective.&nbsp; At any rate, it definitely doesn&#039;t *need* to be refrigerated for the kind of timeline you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Good luck!
