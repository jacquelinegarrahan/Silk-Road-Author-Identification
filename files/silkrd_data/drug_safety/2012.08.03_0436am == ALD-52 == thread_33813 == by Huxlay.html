				I am wondering the exact same thing. I was sold ALD-52 at a festival and I could taste the alcohol (not chemicals) and it also had a mint flavor. I need to try DOC or DOx in general so I could compare it. Either way it was AWESOME.<br /><br />What did yours taste like?

I ask because I tried it for the first time with a friend at a festival and it tasted just like you described it. I tried it at Ultra in Miami in March.

				I&#039;d rather not say because it was a really small festival, sorry. But it was on the west coast very recently.

				It tasted like almost nothing. Just a slight taste of printed blotter for about 10 seconds then just vanished. <br />I have had blotter that was Lsd that had a minty taste to it before. <br /><br />I wonder if some of the Lsd going around is sometimes analogues like lsb or even ald52.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wish someone would synth some and actually confirm its ald because till then its simply a guess
