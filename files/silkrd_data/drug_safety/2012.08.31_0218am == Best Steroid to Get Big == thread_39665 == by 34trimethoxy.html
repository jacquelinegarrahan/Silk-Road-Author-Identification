				Hey,<br /><br />I got a shot from my doc in the arm of some steroid about 3-5 weeks ago. I&#039;ve since gotten noticeably cut. I weigh about a buck 50, but I&#039;m trying to get to 180 in the matter of 2-3 weeks.<br /><br />I hit the gym every-other day for 45 mins to an hour, and started snaking on chicken legs.<br /><br />Anyway, what&#039;s the best steroid to accomplish this? I don&#039;t wanna become a big weightlighter, just cut and big as fuck at around 180.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />I spread them good vibes, God knows I try.

				i am also interested in more or less the same topic as you. i&#039;m sure there are alot of people on these boards with the knowledge you seek but if i were to ask anybody, try flaxceed. hes a vendor on here that seems to specialize in steroids and PE&#039;s. seems to me like he is really in tune with that whole scene and i hope to hit him up when hes no longer in stealth mode. good luck in your quest!

				You need to eat big to get big. Go to bodybuilding.com forums, then the nutrition section, then read the stickies there. <br /><br /><br />Go to steroids.com to get information on the steroids from people who use them

				i just wanted to add that as of right now for my routines i am using whey protein powder, creatine, and glutamine. trying to stick to lean meats and lots of veggies and fruits. the whey shakes are decent meal replacements but this is more of a getting back into the swing of things before i commit to a month or two of hitting the roids. im excited

My doctor gave me a shot, but it wore off already. Also try eating a lot of peanuts.

				To get big you need to eat bit, and lift big. For a novice weight lifter you&#039;ll get more benefit from a 3 x 5 routine and a gallon of milk a day than you will form any combination of steroids and the type of predominantly cardio you&#039;re probably doing at the gym. You could lift seriously, and with dedication for 12 months before being in anything like the condition you&#039;d need to hit for steroids to start doing anything noticeable for you.<br />If you really wish to become a muscle giant, you will need to do the foundation work. You could do yourself an immense favour by going to the Starting Strength wiki.<br />If you don&#039;t care about strength and just want to look big, check out Synthol Man on Youtube. Know that steroids with no heavy lifting won&#039;t make you big. Without proper research and education on the topic you may well grow a great set of breasts though.<br />

				Get some whey or protein shakes. have about 2 or 3 servings a day.. Make sure to eat your regular meals&nbsp; 3 - 4 times a day, and the shakes in between them.. Believe it or not, everyone i know who has put on weight does lots of cardio work, running cycling etc,
