				Hey guys,<br /><br />I have a few questions I&#039;m hoping you might help me with. I&#039;m awaiting the arrival of roxicodone 30 and oxycontin 80 tabs. I have not used for a long time, but I was a regular H user. It looks like the 80&#039;s will be arriving first, which sucks because I will have a low tolerance and am going to need to break the 80&#039;s up. Can anyone explain the difference between the immediate and time release versions? I assume that&#039;s if they are eaten, but what if you smoke or snort them? <br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good way of breaking them up? Also how much I should use first up? I was thinking half a quarter because I know I do have a slightly higher tolerance than an average Joe because of my past, but obviously not the same tolerance I once had. <br /><br />Regarding ingestion, anyone have any good methods of using, probably aside from injecting? I want to try not going down that path again. I wouldn&#039;t mind smoking it but need to know if it works with these tabs or if I will need to buy H to do that. Or are these best used swallowed/chewed/held under tongue?<br /><br />Also does anyone have any good smoking methods aside from chasing the dragon on foil? I don&#039;t want to have to buy a crack pipe either. <br /><br />Sorry for all the questions but any help would be appreciated. Love your work guys, cheers!

				Are you getting the the OP 80s or the old school 80&#039;s? BIG DIFFERENCE!! If they are the new OP&#039;s I would probably stick with the roxy 30&#039;s. much less filler and a lot more flexibility. You can break the new OP&#039;s down, with the oven/microwave method but I have never tried it.. As soon as they switched to the op&#039;s I switched to opanas (one of my top ten moves of all time&nbsp; ;D ) <br /><br />If you want to take them whole then the op 80s are usually ok. I have heard that sometimes they don&#039;t totally disolve in the 12 hours and it cause stomach aches, etc.<br /><br />Even if I had the old school 80&#039;s I think that I would still prefer the roxys..<br /><br />I know a lot of people smoke old school oc&#039;s but don&#039;t ask me why, to me its the biggest waste of all time.. honestly, if you don&#039;t shoot them (good idea not too) then eating them is the best way. you get about 60-70 percent of the oxycodone in your system compared to about 40 percent snorting.. eating them, you wont get that initial rush, but it will stay with you for a long time. Iving you will get 100 percent of the drug into your system, but its not a good idea to shoot pills at all. If you must, please use a wheel filter or at least cotton filter the shit out of them.

				Thanks heaps for the advice. All the listing says is oxycontin 80mg oc80. It doesn&#039;t say opana or anything. Actually it doesn&#039;t even mention time release. Is it possible they are immediate release? I might be best to ask the vendor I suppose!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I believe the regular OC&#039;s went out of production some time ago.&nbsp; So unless someone stockpiled them it&#039;s possible there are counterfeits running around (have personally come across).<br />If they are OP 80&#039;s my recommendation is cutting it in half placing in a small glass with some soft drink and letting it sit for a couple hours, drink it down and voila.&nbsp; A decent buzz.<br />if it is a real OC remove the coating grind it up place into 4 even lines, snort 2 and wait.<br />afaik there are no 80mg IR.

				Yeah I just did a Google search to find oxyCONTIN is only time release. So yeah I guess what I was hoping to find out then was how to beat the time release. Thanks for the feedback towelie! I&#039;ll also read through the OC insufflation(?) thread as well...

				&nbsp;ive started people out on their first ever oxy dose between about 10-20mg snorted, this probably wont be enough for you with residual tolerance but id start around there.

				Also, I forgot to mention that we, in the USA, only get the OP&#039;s. If you are from Canada, Mexico or Europe You will get the old school OC&#039;s (except for Japan) So, if they are legit and say OC on one side and 80 on the other and you know that they aren&#039;t fake, then you have the real deal..<br /><br />Still though, I would stick with either opana&#039;s or roxies, but i wouldn&#039;t complain too much if I got old school OC&#039;s.. <br /><br />The new formulation has an ingredient that has a possible carcinogen it it, hence the reason for mexico and canada not letting the new formula in their country.. Its hard to believe that mexico cares more about their citizens safety than the US..

				I know. It kills me that in the interest of keeping us from harm they add another element of harm.<br />F*ing jackholes.<br />Who the heck wants to eat plasric?
