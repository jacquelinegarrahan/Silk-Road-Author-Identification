				This isn&#039;t a full trip report, just some weird things I noticed on my trip last night. <br /><br />Dosage: ~1mg of 25i-NBOME from kwiktrip, help under the upper lip for ~20-25 minutes, not swallowing saliva, then swallowing the tab itself (I always do this, I don&#039;t know why ...)<br /><br />I&#039;ve done around this dosage once before, maybe a little less (~800mcg), but this time weird things happened. <br /><br />NO, this wasn&#039;t a bad trip, just peculiar. <br /><br />T+30m - I feel really anxious and jittery, almost like a light roll, and it feels like my stomach is churning, but it isn&#039;t. I feel weird feelings in my lower abdominal, hard to explain, it wasn&#039;t pain, just a weird feeling in select spots that would go away. <br /><br />T+1h:30m - I felt the trip really starting to hit, but it wasn&#039;t a morphing hallucinations like before, it was more so a lack of focus and things I would focus on would move, but not morph, or be &quot;hazy&quot; like before. <br /><br />T+2h - I start to have the weirdest part of the trip, I have auditory hallucinations. The anxiety has gone down considerably, but still, think I&#039;m hearing footsteps outside my room or people talking, listening to music with headphones helped that, but still slightly heard it, so I knew it wasn&#039;t happening. (Unless my house is HAUNTED ?/?, just kidding...) <br /><br />For the rest of the trip it was quite enjoyable, the whole thing was, just these weird/different things happening was different. The rest of the trip was the same as the last. <br /><br />I think part of the problem was doing mushrooms last weekend, so visual hallucinations/serotonin/receptors were not at 100%, creating a different trip. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m taking a break from phycs for a month or so. Hopefully to make it better next time. <br /><br /><br />I &lt;3 the SilkRoad :))

Guess I should teach myself better as well :)<br /><br />NBOME is still awesome IMO

				Update, another different effect. <br /><br />I have the BEST afterglow today, not sure why, I&#039;m guessing it was the NBOME. In combination of a caffine pill this morning and some appetite suppressants I use daily, and 5-HTP, amazing day. Energy and cleaned my whole room, I had about 200lbs in empty boxes from stuff I buy for my business, not drugs. Worked for 4 hours strait never feeling tired. <br /><br />Also, no headache, my first time I had a 3 day headache. <br /><br />5-HTP and caffeine/ mild stimulants will help ALOT the next day<br /><br />

				Doesn&#039;t sound too weird, 25i is a wild beast lol. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried it twice (both 1mg from duderugs) and the start always felt really weird/anxious and makes me almost regret taking it but after the first hour it all goes away and then you realize the rewards are totally worth that initial sacrifice.

				I think you just become more aware, are you sure the footsteps weren&#039;t actually there? I tripped on kwiktrip&#039;s 25i-NBOMe a couple of days ago too. I only took one blotter. At one point I was sitting in my bedroom with no music and I got a little anxious because I could hear everything going on in the house, and there were some (real) footsteps outside my door. I played some music and it went away of course.<br /><br />

				I just tried (kwiktrip&#039;s) 25i-nbome for the first time Friday night with my bf (lostinside)... we each dosed 1 blotter and it kicked in within minutes. The trip was quite visual and sound-intensive the first couple hours was the most intense. After that passed the hallucinations didn&#039;t stop and music made the visuals so much more intense. I&#039;ve done alot of acid in my day and it wasn&#039;t like acid in the sense that its not a &quot;mental&quot; trip - it&#039;s all visual and sound induced hallucinations, pretty colors and fractal images. Toward the end of our trip my bf got a little paranoid thoughts and heard people outside the window - but still not a bad trip by any means - after that passed we were able to eat grilled cheese sandwiches, although the food was moving and I was the one cooking lol (and I can&#039;t eat on acid)...after we ate we listened to music and fell asleep easily.<br />I got kind of worried if we decided to buy acid on here - someone doesn&#039;t decide to pass LSD off as 25i.

				The closest I have placed doses of Solaris (25i-NBOMe) together is 8 days between each ride, and there was no discernable difference to me. I have only done it 4 times though: 2mg, 1.5mg ( threshold ), 2mg ( same as 1st ride ), and then 1.75 mg ( mild ), so I think 2mg is the jump off point for my biology ( 43 year old male at 6-1/250 lbs ). Some folks also have the ability to hyper-metabolise PEAs, so be careful and find your &#039;sweet spot&#039;. Start with the recommended EROWID dosage of 1mg and work up steadily if it doesn&#039;t get you there...<br /><br />~Telperion

				^^ The Godfather ^^<br /><br />I do get acute/temporary&nbsp; vasoconstriction associated with deep veinous pain.&nbsp; I have noted that taking some Benadryl helps me in that arena. Benadryl activates a receptor that balances the potential to vasoconstriction ( I read this on a site like Bluelight, but it wasn&#039;t there ). Also cannabis is a good vasodilator, so that is always handy. It has kept me from exploring into the reaches of 25i where I bet thar be monsters!! I&#039;d love to experiment with 3-5mg, but I won&#039;t go beyond 2mg now due to the body load I experience.
