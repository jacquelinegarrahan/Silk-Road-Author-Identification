				I drank 12/13 bottles of miller then snorted an eyeballed dose of 2c-e (I&#039;m guessing it was 15-20mg :/). STUPID idea I know, not to mention the horrendous burn in my right nostril. Only time I&#039;ve had a bad trip...Couldn&#039;t talk to anyone let alone understand them but I could see everyone fine and knew where I was. It felt like a constant short-term memory lapse that&#039;s unstoppable until the drug has worn off.<br /><br />This is just a bad trip I&#039;ve had though, the feeling is different for everyone. Some people just aren&#039;t the same after bad trips, but that&#039;s more often than not, their own fault...

				It&#039;s a weird and extremely unpleasant feeling that is difficult to shake. You end up in a shitty headspace where you can&#039;t stop thinking negative thoughts, get a horrible feeling of anxiety and things just start to scare you for no real reason

				There is no such thing as a bad trip, only difficult trips.<br />Whatever difficulties you are experiencing during the trip, thoughts of dying, paranoia, etc. , focus on you&#039;re breathing, focus on why you&#039;re thinking these thoughts, is your mind trying to sell you something? listen.... just listen.

Same effects, no increase in magnitude either.<br />Now, that isn&#039;t my only &quot;bad&quot; trip(I snorted 75mg DMT freebase once, felt like a bullet in my nose and that was before I started tripping harder than I ever have on DMT). But I think I actually enjoy the trips make tear me to pieces more than the peaceful ones. I&#039;ve always been the one to calm myself and others down, and never get into any serious trouble.&nbsp; When you get back to base, it feels so wonderful to be sober. It is like being born again, to re-experience the world with new eyes. You begin to notice so many things that you may have missed before. You stop living on auto-pilot and begin to take it all in. For a little while at least, that is the downside of psychedelics.....<br /><br />Like Holly said, accept the experience. I hate to sound corny but: Resistance is futile&nbsp; ;D

				A bad trip is characterized by a lot of anxiety, and just bad thoughts and images constantly popping into your mind and it&#039;s just so hard to shake those negative feelings once you&#039;ve got them.<br /><br />That being said, a lot of good can come from a bad trip. If you start down a bad path whilst tripping, try and identify the source of your anxiety. What is it that&#039;s bothering you? Often times you can identify what the problem is and once you&#039;ve figured that out, the trip can easily be set back on a much nicer path. Someone in a previous post said that there&#039;s no such thing as a bad trip, and there are only difficult trips. That&#039;s really a great way to put it, you can always overcome a bad trip.

				I&#039;ve had instances where I literally felt my very being was being ripped through different realities, just a constant loop of tangible fear that I&#039;d never return to our reality, these moments can feel like centuries despite being only several seconds long. Even once I physically return, my brain can&#039;t even recognize my own room or recall who I am but only that I&#039;m in danger. These trips make me realize that there are far worse concepts than dying. I&#039;ve had times where I&#039;ve been stuck in a corner, curled up like an infant with figments of my imagination playing cruel tricks on me and messing with my mind. Delusions are by far the worse, you can have entire conversations with people, only to realize you&#039;re in fact alone. One second you might believe you&#039;re watching television...flash forward a single second and you&#039;re somehow walking around on the other side of town....another second goes by and you just barely stop yourself from microwaving your neighbors Chihuahua. You might very well believe you&#039;re simply picking up your phone, only it&#039;s still ringing which confuses you, it turns out it was the doorbell you&#039;ve been hearing so you go answer the door instead, so obviously you open the door but no one&#039;s there. Only then you understand that there never was any ringing and that it was all in your head. Bad trips can be utterly terrifying, but if you can manage to tough them out or meditate yourself back to having a good trip, well then you can survive anything that comes your way.<br /><br />Keeping yourself morally positive in life probably helps prevent bad trips in the first place. I say this because I can&#039;t keep track of the amount of time I&#039;ve had flashbacks of inhumane acts I&#039;ve done in life which just completely demoralizes me and makes me have a conscience for the remainder of the trip. Under normal circumstances I&#039;m a sick fuck who get&#039;s off on looking at gore, death, etc. But while I&#039;m tripping it can get pretty dark as it often integrates my good memories with the nasty shit I&#039;ve seen. For example, I&#039;ll recall a video of a Mexican man being decapitated with a chainsaw alongside the last time I had sex, just intermingling with each other. The human mind can be a scary place sometimes. :-\

				I took shrooms and ended up curled up in a ball thinking I was dying, wanting to go to the hospital, etc. I would call that a bad trip. Nothing bad actually happened, I was just feeling nervous which triggered panic attacks.

				One of my very first drug experiences would qualify as a bad trip.&nbsp; I took around 800 mg of DXM that I had extracted from some Robitussin gel caps.&nbsp; About an hour and a half in I was vomiting my fucking brains out, so much so that I burst tons of blood vessels in and around my eyes.&nbsp; Eventually I was throwing up straight bile, the green color of which matched nicely with all the blood pouring out of my nose (apparently DXM dries your sinuses).<br /><br />So, my nausea finally subsides, and I go to grab a drink downstairs... I&#039;d imagine this next part would&#039;ve looked pretty hilarious to an observer, because I basically robowalked right off the top step of the staircase and went careening downward head first.&nbsp; I spent the rest of the trip moaning on the couch, but later that night I went out and tried salvia with some friends for the first time!&nbsp; Overall a valuable experience, and in the 100 or so trips I&#039;ve had since then almost all have been lovely.

I&#039;m pretty confident in myself and always think I look better while I&#039;m tripping. My favorite drugs dramatically increase my senses in one way or another, so I feel incredible about myself while tripping which is why I prefer to do as many drugs as I do. I&#039;ve always heard the rumor, &quot;Don&#039;t ever look in the mirror on acid!&quot;, but it&#039;s all nonsense to me. The only risk I can find in viewing my reflection is it&#039;s a bit too hypnotic. Why not study my physical self further while doing this self-exploration into my mind?

				i&#039;ve had a number of &quot;bad trips&quot; in my day....and man, I wouldn&#039;t wish that on anyone.&nbsp; It builds character, but so does getting robbed at gun point or beating cancer.&nbsp; better to just try and avoid those kinds of episodes.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had mushrooms make me suicidal or just helpless and crying for hours in bed, I&#039;ve had acid make me delusional and paranoid to such an extreme level that I&#039;d be embarrassed to describe to you what was going through my head.&nbsp; lets just say it was the most consumed by pure fear I&#039;ve ever felt.&nbsp; my first breakthrough Salvia experience was colored by sheer horror, but that soon gave way to amazement and appreciation for the &quot;tough love&quot; sally dishes out.&nbsp; I also once took a heroic dose of pure psilocybin that was clearly too much for me to handle; the voice in my head was telling/showing me some history of the galaxy involving our species being planted here and raised for some reason, possibly to keep us safe from the war which is going on across the dimensions...around this point I was so freaked out about what was going through my head that i ran to the bathroom and vomited my guts out and just started babbling &quot;i don&#039;t wanna know i don&#039;t wanna know i don&#039;t wanna know&quot; over and over until the trip started to wane.&nbsp; ::shudder::&nbsp; shit gets intense.&nbsp; In all these experiences, trying to claw my way back to sanity was more epic than all 3 lord of the rings movies.&nbsp; It took every ounce of soul that I had to make it back here without majorly serious mental damage<br /><br />I never let that stop me though, as I didn&#039;t want to feel defeated by a difficult experience.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done acid, mushrooms, and pure psi after having had these negative experiences and i&#039;ve been fine, but I can sure tell you that I ain&#039;t the same kid I was.&nbsp; I used to be all wide eyed and in love with the idea of psychedelia, but I&#039;m much more cautious and hesitant with my psychs these days, knowing in the back of my head that any trip could go terribly terribly wrong.&nbsp; I just pray to the gods of whatever drug i&#039;m on that it won&#039;t go sour, but I also know that I can get through it if I must.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a person like me who&#039;s got a few ugly psychological issues lurking under the surface, I strongly urge you to be cautious and humble in your psychedelic drug use.&nbsp; work yourself up to big doses.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let your friends make you think that its just fun &amp; games and no big deal....these drugs can be serious business.<br /><br />I hear people say &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as a bad trip&quot; and while I understand/appreciate the sentiment and know that they&#039;ve got the right attitude.....they&#039;re fucking full of shit.&nbsp;

				- I was in a crowded environment. I thought that everyone I saw was talking about me. I heard people playing some music, and thought they were really singing about me, trying to humiliate me. Advertisements on billboards were referring to me.&nbsp; Everyone was &#039;in on it&#039;. I also kept imagining myself as some sort of goblin, and was angry because I thought everyone else was perceiving me in this way. I also couldn&#039;t stop imagining people I knew as grotesque caricatures of themselves. I also was afraid the cops were looking for me, and I kept imagining them as dwarves.<br /><br />- On a high dose of LSD, I thought that I was in two places at once. I thought that my &#039;real&#039; body was still where I was standing a few minutes earlier. I felt that I had permanently left that body, and was convinced that I would never return to reality. I thought I was in the afterlife. I thought that my new body only existed inside of the patterns that I kept seeing everywhere.

				First time on shrooms so far was my WORST trip. I did the research and settled on 2mg, but 2 hours into the trip I got it into my head that I took a lethal dose. My brother had convinced me to take huge bongs hits so that I didnt waste the mushies... Huge mistake. Easily the worst part of the trip are those 5 seconds where I was giggling away and suddenly this dark feeling unsettled my stomach and the mood became very... evil? Wrong? It&#039;s hard to describe, but it akin to watching a horror film unfold. My short term memory had become less than 10 seconds - this make time seem VERY long. I went to bed and found that I could not leave. I don&#039;t know if I fell asleep, but I had very life-like visuals for what felt like a days.<br /><br />Despite how much I hated the trip at the time, it was very important in motivating me in my life. I&#039;m thankful that I experienced it, but I wouldn&#039;t want to go through it again.

				A bad trip is dropping three tabs of strong acid for your first ever psychedelic trip and experiencing the following:<br /><br />- Convincing myself the people I was tripping with had drugged me with the intention of gang raping and bukkaki&#039;ing me, with the ultimate plan of videotaping me during the whole process and then releasing it onto the internet. Running around a house clenching your butt and swatting imaginary air penises with your hands praying to not be raped is not cool when the mysteries of the universe are unravelling themselves in your mind.<br /><br />- Watching the TV show Daria and becoming convinced that my male parts where metamorphising into female parts and I was destined to spend the rest of my life as a woman.<br /><br />- Thinking I had pissed my pants and constantly asking everyone to touch my pants cause I was sure they were soaked in piss. This went on for a few hours.<br /><br />-Watching the movie Wall Street and having Charlie Sheen talk to me.<br /><br />- Watching Heavy Metal. FUCK.THAT.SHIT.<br /><br />But I wouldnt even consider this a particularly bad trip. The worst trips are when all external stimuli have no effect on your mindset and you drift further and further into a negative and anxious headspace to the point where even your OEV&#039;s and CEV&#039;s become terrifying and hostile. The feeling of not being to escape your own mind is the worst feeling I&#039;ve ever experienced.

				It&#039;s pretty funny the things you can convince yourself of when tripping. My last trip I was 100% sure that I ripped a shitload of holes in my pants. I just got all fixated on the fact that I ruined my favorite pair of pants and it was fucking with my vibes. The next morning I wake up and look down and they aren&#039;t ripped at all

				Picture yourself on a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.......<br /><br />Growing up I always wanted to trip hard enough to have an experience like this. When I had it it wasnt fun. It was one of the worst nights of my life actually. <br /><br />I was paralyzed from head to toe and couldnt move or open my eyes. I was seeing intense waves of colors and sick visuals, but I couldnt move and thought I was gonna die. In fact the trip was so bad I actually was looking forward to death as it would have ended my misery. Now thats a bad trip....

				A bad trip for me personally was like this: Imagine you become too cold and you feel stuck in a horrifying blizzard, your vision is becoming more and more blurred by snow and your thoughts clouded by panic. You have no idea where your feet are leading you and the only thing you&#039;re confident in is that you&#039;re going in circles. Then it starts to get too warm, you begin to sweat and feel damp everywhere. You feel disgusting and no amount of cold water will ease those sensations. You do your best to snap out of it but these sensations just keep alternating and getting more intense and then it hits you. You&#039;re not actually too cold or hot, you&#039;re LSD-addled mind is fucking with you. Your own body and this wonderful chemical and have betrayed you. You&#039;ve now been pushed out of a plane and take a nasty dive down into oceans of personal uncertainty, immense regrets, self-loathing, and a new breed of fear. A fear that you haven&#039;t felt since you were 2 years old and you were so sure as soon as the lights went down at bedtime, those monsters were going to eat you in the most grotesque way possible and you didn&#039;t feel any semblance of hope. Soon enough the monsters upheave anything you felt secure behind and they start tearing you apart. Their razor-sharp teeth cleave right through your happiest memories and experiences and leave nothing but disgusting scraps of them. All of their hawk-like talons sink into your mental wounds and scars and pull them out even more. You&#039;re blinded by light and can barely focus, staggering around like a drunk. Then all of a sudden a violent scream inside of you rips through everything and the lights shatter, it&#039;s so fucking loud that you just want to curl up and fall apart. You&#039;re now stumbling around in complete darkness, stuck in an oblivion populated by solely you. Seconds feel like days and time is no longer a companion to you. You keep hoping a hand will materialize and pull you out or hold you until it&#039;s all over. Ugly, twisted doors instead begin to appear before you and each one allows you to walk right back into memories of your life. For all intents and purposes, you have actually traveled back through time, your memories are that vivid and immersive. You begin to see all the times you could of been better and all the times you failed so miserably, your memories are slowly becoming tainted and sick. Your loved ones look meaner, your childhood best friend tells you he could of done better, your exes appear in front of you and tell you they know you&#039;re going to fail again and you are a joke. You feel trapped. That feeling keeps getting louder, more intense and just pulses through every inch of your body and mind. You&#039;d love to actually scream so someone could check on you, but you&#039;re trapped inside of your mind, your once haven. You feel stuck and broken as a person. Then you hear the song on your ipod change and you snap out of it. You focus on you&#039;re breathing and soon you get a grip. You look at your hands to realize that you are alright and you look at your clock and see all of this has only happened within 4 minutes. Hope has this been educational or at least entertaining. Respect your substances and do them when you know you&#039;re okay to do them. Peace guys.

				I&#039;m a new drug user, and I just had my first bad trip today. It&#039;s was on a high dose of methylone, around 250-300 mg. Everything was wonderful, until I decided I&#039;d put on some porn. Basically I just chose some random video, which quickly turned horrifying, as it was rape. I closed my laptop, threw up, and sat in the corner shaking for a good 30 minutes. It was just terrible. I&#039;m fine now, I even went back and watched it again to see if it would affect me the same way and it didn&#039;t.
