				Ok long story short my dickhead buddy decided to cut VM&#039;s meth wth sugar and then gave it back to me saying it was bunk. Which i know it wasn&#039;t but that&#039;s neither here nor there. Now I need to know how to wash the glucose out of it. <br /><br />Keep in mind I have never done this before and am a total noob. Please explain what each chemical is and where i might be able to purchase them. I have no lab equipment so need to improvise with common house hold items. <br /><br />PLEASE only reply if you definitely know what your talking about i&#039;m not ready to blow the whole bag coz i took advice from someone whom had a guess or hunch. Sorry if this sounds a little aggressive i do not mean it that way i&#039;m just super pissed at my mate!!! Oh and thanks every1 on here for there help both past and present. :)

				From what I have learned in the last 12 hrs, acetone will remove most impurities but not glucose/sugar. I hear you need methanol is this correct???? ANYONE.... :(

				I found this on another forum is it the right info? <br /><br />&quot;Do a dual recrystallization to the powder. Basically pour a little acetone on it then pour a little rubbing alcohol on it use the 90% then slowly heat it up to boil off the al. Before it boils off all the way add a little more acetone then continue on low until crystals precipitate out of it. There are several methods but that is easy and beats sugar and the black crude your smoking.&quot;<br /><br />Is there anything i need to look for?&nbsp; Is it possible to add too much acetone or alcohol?

				Or is this better aaaaggghhhh...<br /><br />Get some epsom salts (magnesium sulfate heptahydrate) and put it in a pie plate. Spread it out. Put it in the oven and turn it on HIGH.<br /><br />(here&#039;s yer optional Chem Lesson...MgSO4, MW = 120; 7 [hepta....get it?]H2O that&#039;s 7 times 18 (18 being the MW of H2O = water) = 126. That means that there&#039;s more WATER in the damn Epsom salts than there is Mag Sulfate)<br /><br />It will partly liquify...get all bubbly...thats normal. Keep heating it. Bake the shit outta it.<br /><br />At the end it&#039;ll turn into a, like, ROCK. This is magnesium sulfate, anhydrous. Powder that shit up.<br /><br />Get some nice little brown, narrow mouthed bottles. Put some of your powdered magnesium sulfate, anhydrous, in each. (let it cool, first!) Now, fill one of the the bottles up with your HEET, and the other with some of that hardware store acetone. Shake them up, a few times...let em settle...that will take a couple hours.<br /><br />Now, you have DRY methanol and DRY acetone.<br /><br />Extinguish all cigarettes. Take your crank, wash it first with the acetone. If it&#039;s &quot;peanut butter&quot; crank, there&#039;ll be little dirt bombs of shit, mush them up.<br />it&#039;ll look like a fucking MIRACLE. All the brown waxy crap will dissolve....leaving a snowstorm of the purest of the pure. Filter it. What stays in the filter is what you want. Dry the product (the best way is to get a little saucer, put it on top of a little bowl of HOT water...leave it in a well ventilated area till there&#039;s no more acetone smell. What you have now will be LOTS better than what you started with. The acetone, that came through the filter...it&#039;s CRAP. Flush it down the toilet.<br /><br />Not good enough? OK. Take your purified product, dissolve it in the dried HEET. There&#039;s stuff that don&#039;t dissolve? Then, filter again. This time, keep what comes through the filter. The stuff that stays in the filter....it&#039;s BUNK, toss it.<br /><br />Now, take that stuff that comes through the filter, the HEET solution (now you&#039;re a chemist, let&#039;s call it by its right name, methanol) and evaporate it, SLOWLY. In a well ventilated area - methanol is poisonous. It won&#039;t leave poison in your gear, just make sure it all evaporates. Be patient...let it be...then, watch the crystal magic. Once it&#039;s ALL evaporated, do just one more acetone wash. Keep the stuff in the filter. Dry it, as described above.
