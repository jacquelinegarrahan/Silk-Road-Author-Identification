				Ok, say there&#039;s a gram of 2C-B, and ideally one wanted to divide into doses of between 15-18mg doses, resulting in something like 60 capsules out of a gram.<br />Problem is: a) wouldn&#039;t it look like a tiny tiny amount for one capsule<br />and b) scales only go down to 100th of a gram, so measuring that small a dose is impossible<br /><br />Would this mean mixing it well with another 6 grams of inert filler?<br />What filler should they use? and preferably one that can be found on the high street?<br /><br />Glucose is good but the problem is that people might think you&#039;re trying to fuck them over, even if you&#039;re honest that there&#039;s 15-18mgs of 2c-b in there...<br />what would anyone suggest?<br /><br />ps. this isn&#039;t for resale on SR, it&#039;s for friends/friends of friends ;)<br /><br />thanks in advance

				I saw some mini 15-20 mg spoons on eBay though I wouldn&#039;t know how accurate that is. <br /><br />I plan to use volumetrics, dissolving 100mg of 2c-b into 20ml of water which would mean 3-4ml doses for you and your friends. Shot glasses anyone?

				Yeah, I like to measure volumetrically as well.&nbsp; But if you want to use capsules, I would just put the chemical in there directly, no filler.&nbsp; If they ask, just say you used no filler and point out how amazing it is that such a small amount of powder will facilitate such an experience.<br /><br />As for measuring, you really need a mg scale, 1/100 isn&#039;t enough for 2c-b.&nbsp; The error is too big.&nbsp; Even with a mg scale, for precise dosing like this, adding a bit of weight to the scale should help keep things more accurate.&nbsp; Weigh the capsule, then fill it up until it&#039;s X mg heavier.<br /><br />Really, you can&#039;t go wrong with volumetric measuring, using distilled water since 2c-b is soluble in water.

				tres interessant!<br />yeah, this sounds much better.<br />Also, do you reckon standard cheap emptied-out paracetemol capsules can hold liquid quite well for carrying it around in handy amounts?<br />If anyone&#039;s tried this?

				Haha, I literally have just finished making some 8mg 2C-B capsules from 500mg of EuroPEA&#039;s powder, took such a long time!<br /><br />Last night, I dissolved 500mg 2C-B in the minimum amount of hot Ph Eur 70% IPA and made the volume up to 6mL with more of the solvent.<br /><br />Then I weighed out 60x 200mg portions of mannitol. Then to each pile I added 0.1 mL of the solution using a microsyringe and allowed it to dry under a lamp.<br /><br />Today I capped up each pile into 00 gelatine capsules (cheap as anything from eBay) which was pretty arduous. Testing tomorrow night. <br />8mg caps are nice as you can fine tune the dosage for friends.<br /><br /><br />**edit- just read the bit about you not being able to use glucose. You can lay 2C-B on blotter at a loading of around 10mg on a 12x12mm square, using 70% IPA. You have to apply the solution to the blotter paper, let it dry under a lamp for an hour then reapply on the other side. A few free samples usually helps sway sceptics :D

				sounds like a mission lol!<br />probs gonna try 100mg first using distilled water method because it sounds like I can get away with just some basic apparatus...<br />just to really test this stuff out with some mates ;)<br /><br />let me know how your method goes wowzers...

				http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012TDNAM/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details&nbsp; Milligram scale on amazon- best deal I&#039;ve seen and is pretty accurate unless you want to spend over 100 dollars on one...

				1mg capacity scales are not the same as being accurate to the mg. For that you would need to spring at least $100. <br /><br />If you read the 1 star reviews, they will tell you that there is a margin of error, about 10-20mg (so the actual weight can be + or - 10 to 20mg).
