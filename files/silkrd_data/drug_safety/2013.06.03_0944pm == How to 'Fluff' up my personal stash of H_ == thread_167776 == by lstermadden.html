				Hey guys, I am over in the north east of USA. I have been ordering good ass H for a few months now off the road, and I always run into an issue. I finish my products too fast! If 1 gram lasts me 4 days, thats great! So if I try to think ahead, and get 2 grams, it should last me 8 days right? Nope :( <br /><br />Half of the addiction is psycological and my body thinking it wants more, so I just keep sniffing. Now as anyone can tell you, your not supposed to sniff that much H at one time, or else it will get wasted in your stomach.<br /><br />Do you guys have any ideas on how I can turn my 1G into more? Like a cut that isn&#039;t bad at all on your sinus. Once again, im not doing this to profit, I am doing this for my own personal stash.<br /><br />People I have read about are saying to get Lactose, which sounds great.. but I cannot just go to duane reade and get powdered lactose.. <br /><br />Anyone know a good everyday product that can do this for me?

				What about powdered LACTASE? I&#039;m lactose intolerant, so lactose would be bad for me. But I&#039;m highly interested in this as well.<br /><br />If lactase would work, you could crush up Lactaid pills and cut it with that (they&#039;re expensive; don&#039;t get the brand name). However, I have obviously never insufflated lactase, and do not know its affect on the sinuses. This is purely speculation. <br /><br />EDIT: Sorry. I suggest TO get the brand name... don&#039;t. Off brand is the same stuff and cheaper.

Unless you&#039;re trying to cut ounces of heroin, a personal stash should be easily cut with lactase. Search on the clearnet for cutting with lactase. Maybe you&#039;ll find something.<br /><br />Or, heck, just try to insufflate a Lactaid pill and see if it burns lol. I doubt it will. :P It&#039;s just an enzyme that breaks down lactose.

				cook up heroin and with syringe drop into your nose . Like say slowly cook up a line in 60 cc water and drop 20 cc&#039;s into your nose.... You will feel it in 2-5 mins.

Plus, heroin cut with other opiates is bad IMHO.

				No problem, bud. Don&#039;t worry about it. I was being serious, yep. It really doesn&#039;t taste gross at all. Just a little chalky. It&#039;s very powdery when crushed. I just have no idea how it is on your sinuses. Good luck and you&#039;re welcome!

				Hello!<br /><br />I know the best thing that you could put your H that it get more!<br />So if you have 1 gram i would say you put 0,25 gram of this product to the H!<br />The product does have any effect ,it doesn&#039;t smeel, it doesn&#039;t makes you high and it doesn&#039;t is bad for you healthy!<br />Take some Milkpowder, you can get one Kilogramm for about 4 Eruos!<br />Milkpowder is also called Coffeewithener! You get it in every supermarket! just ask if you don&#039;t find it!<br /><br />So your stuff is not so strong after you mix it with the powder but your head does think you already have ah lot at home, it is only the psychological aspect that you think you have more stuff! Also some dealers take it if the get 80% Cocaine, the could sell it on the streets so the mix it with this powder 1:1 and the coke is already so strong that you think it is pure! <br /><br />But if i buy some H i tested it with ah simple laboratory test if it is cut with something, and when yes i see with what, but this test is expensive , i get it from my work for free, not really for free but i only take it because you could take the test i think over 100 times!<br /><br />Otherwise you could buy some Fentanyl and put it to the H it also works very well but it also costs about 80€ per Gramm but you only should put 0,2gram Fentanyl to 1 gram H because Fentanyl is 7 times stronger than herion but it has other effects than heroin!<br /><br />If you take fentanyl you get more tired and dizzy!<br /><br />Ah good Vendor for Fentanyl is SunWu&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/acb70e1978<br /><br />I hope i could help you, if yes give me some karma^^<br /><br />regards

				^ First off, don&#039;t ask for karma really, because it&#039;s, for the most part, pointless. This isn&#039;t Reddit lol.<br /><br />Second, I think you&#039;re referring to powdered coffee creamer. I wouldn&#039;t use that if you&#039;re insufflating, as it will clog your sinuses. I wouldn&#039;t want to inject that shit either. It&#039;s not going to be &quot;sterile&quot; like an individually wrapped pill. Stick with lactase.
