				So for the big sale tomorrow, I will be purchasing a half sheet of Tony&#039;s LSD, and a couple grams of Ivory&#039;s molly. Both are basically the best quality of their kind on the site, and I plan on having my first candy flip when I eventually receive them. But everywhere I look, I see different answers for doses and when to take each. The best suggestion I think I&#039;ve seen was someone said that I should take 2 tabs of LSD, wait 2 hours, then take 200 mg of MDMA, but I have no idea if this is accurate or not.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				That sounds pretty accurate. May want to lessen the dose of MDMA to 130-150mg so as not to overpower the LSD. Happy flipping!

				Sounds good, 150 mg molly and about 225 mics LSD, sounds like the time of my fucking life. Can someone tell me what candy flipping is like? I mean it&#039;s just awesome but I&#039;ve never gotten a great description or anything.

				I get that, but I personally like to take the acid, and right when I start to come up, rail the molly. I usually take 2 tabs, and 150mg. I don&#039;t like coming down from the molly during the trip, but the trip will peak again before it is all over, and if I waited 2 hours in before taking the molly, I would likely be coming down from both at the same time, and life would suck.

Seriously my favorite combo. It&#039;s been too long and I&#039;m looking forward to combining the 2 in about a month. <br /><br />When on good LSD I experience tremendous euphoria, but I have a hard time speaking and putting my thoughts into words. When candyflipping, everything flows and the world is amazing.

				Don&#039;t take the MDMA until you are feeling the acid strong.. Or you start having a bad trip. <br />I wouldn&#039;t suggest a 200mg dose unless you are moderately experienced with both drugs... Try 120mg. <br />The MDMA will just brighten everything up, and make you much more confidant with your tripping ability.. Its very hard to have a bad trip while rolling.
