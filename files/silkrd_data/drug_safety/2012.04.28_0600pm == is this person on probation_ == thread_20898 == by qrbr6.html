				It sounds like a scan where they shoot you up with dye and scan your body in a CT Scanner.

When a friend of mine got a colon exam or something, can&#039;t quite remember, he had to not eat for like 24 hours and drink this cleansing liquid that would clean your system out (of food and liquid). So OP, I doubt the person in question is on probation. Most likely a medical examination. Though I could be wrong...

				Fasting for 12 hours is the standard for anyone who is going to have a blood test the following day.<br /><br />Standard testing is usually a chemistry panel which includes your liver and kidney function, your electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, sodium, etc. They may also check your glucose levels.<br /><br />A complete blood count (platelets, red blood cells, white blood cells, etc)--checks for anemia, infection, blood clotting problems, etc.<br /><br />They may check your cholesterol levels, your thyroid, and possibly your heart.<br /><br />The want you to fast so they can get an accurate idea of your levels.&nbsp; For example, if they are testing your sugar levels, eating or drinking will elevate everything, they want to know what your levels are when your body is basically at rest.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the replies guys. Just one more question, what does smoking have to do with it? Whether that be cigarettes or weed, are you not allowed to smoke for a blood test for a check up or something?

				I had to get monthly blood tests for this medicine I was on. I couldn&#039;t eat anything within 12 hours of giving my blood sample. They didn&#039;t say anything about smoking though.

				I&#039;ve never heard about that one either.&nbsp; I can&#039;t think what the point of asking you to not smoke would be.

				I do blood exams regularly and I have to fast for 12 hours before the exam (which usually means no breakfast since I usually do them in the morning). I don&#039;t think he&#039;s on probation.
