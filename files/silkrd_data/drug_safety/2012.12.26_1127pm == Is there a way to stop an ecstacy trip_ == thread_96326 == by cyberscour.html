				Valium, Lorazepam, any decent benzo. Theres a guy on here that can help you out, his knowledge is far greater than mine on the subject. He stocks loads and has a good idea on their comparative uses. His name is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quinone on the forums. <br /><br />It kinda surprised me, I dont think anyone has ever told me that exctacy was too intense. more like people saying they wished it lasted forever... <br /><br />Anyways. you sure it was ecstacy you took and not 2cb? <br /><br />ACE

				there is no way to stop any trip once its in your blood stream you just have to ride it out<br />be smarter next time and take a small dose to begin with<br /><br />if everything was too intense i would&#039;ve gone for a long walk to get some of that energy out<br />ignore what people say about taking other drugs to help<br />if your brain is over loading there is no other chemical that will help you<br />taking more drugs to help already being to high? sounds like a fun overdose

				You can stop an ecstasy trip with a serotonin antagonist. The compound binds to the active sites on the receptors, effectively blocking them. Some antipsychotics are serotonin antagonists, for example Seroquel I believe.

I love turning people onto the occasional e vacation but I normally make sure they have someone there that has done it before when they do. It makes things more fun and keeps the &quot;OH FUCK THIS CAN&#039;T BE NORMAL!&quot; crap out of people&#039;s heads. Nice thing about an e-sitter is it&#039;s just fine if they are rolling with you, just good to have a buddy around as you poke around new drugs.<br /><br />Anyway, be more careful next time, the ride up on good MDMA, properly dosed, really should be pretty pleasant. If it sucked then you probably took too much or took something not quite MDMA. Not a big deal, lots of fun to be had out there but next time just ask around before you try something new, most everyone here just want to help out other like minded adventurers. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Honestly I&#039;ve never really shot straight up like that on MDMA so I&#039;m a little worried you might have something not just MDMA Sounds more like methalone to me but you know better than I do what you took. Normally for me a ride up on an oral does is pretty consistent... do I feel it? No I&#039;m just imagining it... maybe... hummmm.... when did I take all my clothes off and crawl into bed with my girlfriend? For most folks, in my experience, good MDMA is more sedating than energizing even though it&#039;s a amphetamine. I always think it&#039;s weird that people rave on this stuff since most of the time I really just want to snuggle with a pretty girl.<br /><br />Anyway, if you ever need anything let us know, some of us here love our MDMA and want to make sure others use it well and have a great time with it.<br /><br />Take care!
