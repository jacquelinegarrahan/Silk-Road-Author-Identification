				first time i did meth i had a point, and 5 hours later i did another point and i was so high after the second even my vision was fully trippin out.. was almost like in another world.<br /><br />but ever since then, about 20 times in 3 months ive never even come close to getting that same high as the first time.. if the first time was a 10 then all subsequent times have been a 1 or less in comparison. i never get that visual mind altering hit like i did the first time.. i still have the mental raised libido but i wonder sometimes if im totally overating the drug.<br /><br />could snort half a gram in 10 minutes (sourced from mah mate kushy so we know its good gear like all the boys on the road know kushy sells the good shit)&nbsp; and it would never even come close.<br /><br />i dont do it the teh time and at times im having 3 weeks break from the shit.. never do it more than 1 day in a row either.<br /><br /><br />its either just the way it is or the constant use of l-tyrosine powder is taking all the effects away.. i dont use l-tyrosine and supps as a preload, just been using them as an endless postload andt never overloading the amounts.<br /><br /><br />not used l-tyrosine for a few weeks and will try everything again soon, but u know.. meth just seems like its overrated in my brain.. big fuss in my subconcious over a pissy little high

				half a gram in 10 minutes? <br />wow.. you got a&nbsp; fucked up tolerance&nbsp; i don&#039;t think you&#039;ll ever get near a 5... even if you change Roa...<br /><br />same thing happened with me with every kinda amphetamine i have ever tried.. first one is always the best. <br /><br />

				the only way to lower your tolerance is to stop taking the drug, at least for a period of time. tolerance is a sign that you&#039;re overdoing it. too much of a good thing... :P

				The first time use is like being on top of a mountain... The best feeling you will get from the drug. Also, the higher dose you start with, the quicker this becomes a problem. After that, it slowly, or not so slowly, rolls down that mountain til&#039; you are using insane amounts, changing ROA, or even mixing other drugs to &quot;chase that high&quot;. It will probably take a VERY long time of just no use at all in order for you to even get close to that feeling again. This is all a fundamental part of using drugs. Take care! 8)

				Meth really fucks with your dopamine levels and receptors so you need to stop using for a good week or two between doses.
