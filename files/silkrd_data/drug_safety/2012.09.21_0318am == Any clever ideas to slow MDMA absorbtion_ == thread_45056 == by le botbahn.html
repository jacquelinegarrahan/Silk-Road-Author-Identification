				So I&#039;ve seen many reports comparing the experience of pure mdma pills vs&#039; molly. Someone pointed out that the nature of pills provides a slower rate of absorbtion and probably a more drawn out onset (due to binders/filler impeding rapid absorbtion).<br /><br />I think there is definitely something to that. It&#039;s true of Rx pills (binders) and it makes sense for MDMA as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m very happy with the molly I have, but I&#039;m interested in playing around with this concept. Normally I swallow my crushed rocks in a gel cap. <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in any suggestions that you may have as far as any binders I could add/use to mix with the MDMA in order to achieve the slower release of pills.<br /><br />If anyone with experience with the binders or formulas used to makethem (similar or close to that of presses), I&#039;d appreciate any info. I believe I&#039;ve heard cornstarch &amp; cellulose before?<br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not.trying to make presses, just looking for.possible ways to slow the absorption by mixing something with the MDMA and then placing in a gelcap.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				I think you actually have to press the pill rather than mixing the ingredients as I don&#039;t think a crushed pill will last as long as a solid press and that&#039;s essentially what you&#039;ll be eating.

Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant though which is believed to help prevent free-radical damage and thus reduce the likelihood of neurotoxicity, so still a good idea. As for antacid being contradictory, yes it would be, but unless I&#039;m mistaken it&#039;s not the acidic nature of Vit C that helps so it should still do the job. The antacid is just to settle the stomach as too low pH can leave you feeling sick.<br /><br />OP, I think the easiest way to slow absorption would be to just eat something before you drop your cap. Any slowing of release in pills will be your body needing to break it down into smaller bits that can be absorbed which takes longer for a whole pill vs a powder/crushed crystals.

				Some amphetamines can have increased absorption by gastrointestinal alkalizing agents ie sodium bicarbonate, antacid. In addition, blood plasma levels can be increased by urinary alkalizing agents which inhibits its excretion. Lastly, inhibiting certain liver enzymes will probably prevent its excretion as well ie grapefruit juice.

The dopamine is oxidised into I think 0- and H+ ions which in turn destroy the serotonin receptors. The idea of taking anti-oxidants before rolling aims to reduce this oxidation of dopamine in the serotonin receptors which thus reduces neurotoxicity. However, the serotonin receptors do regenerate, but in different pathways, and scientists are yet to conclude what the ramifications are of producing new pathways, that is still inconclusive after hundreds of studies etc.<br /><br />If what I have read is factual, it is important that people who roll on a regular basis are aware of the ways to combat damage.<br /><br />As for the OP&#039;s original question. I don&#039;t think mixing other materials with the molly inside the gelcap will make a difference, if any. The pressure used to press the pills is holding it together, making it take longer to dissolve in the stomach. What you might also want to look at is the fact that powders have a much larger surface area to volume ratio. This means more area for the acids of the stomach to act upon your mdma, so it will absorbed quicker. A larger rock will be absorbed slower than powder, so again the pill is ahead. I know prescription meds contain thicker capsules, like the &#039;slow release&#039; ones. If you were able to find caps made of the same compound then you might be able to achcieve what you are after. This is simply my opinion, could be totally wrong, but thought I&#039;d try and point you in the right direction.<br />

				Thanks for all your input. I may try a gelcap within a gelcap, maybe with another gelcap as an experiment. With a portion of the full dose in each cap. <br />Or experiment worth an mda combo. <br />I love the magic of mdma, but I find that it just doesn&#039;t last long enough for my taste.<br />I may look into 6-apb as well if it&#039;s ever available at a reasonable againhere on SR.

				I know exactly what you mean, when it starts to wear off after 3-4 hours and you want to keep going. Unfortunately re-dosing 3+ hours later only increases the physical effects (increase heart rate, higher blood pressure etc) and doesn&#039;t increase euphoria as your serotonin is severely depleted, so your literally throwing molly down the drain. If you can get your hands on some mda, I would highly suggest making a 50/50 combination of say 100mg mdma/100mg mda (or 150mg of both respectively, if your daring). MDA is known to have a longer duration than mdma, more tripy, with the added euphoria of the mdma as well, it is something special to combine both. If only we had an aussie vendor who had good quality MDA :(

				When using 6-apb, take half your mdma dose around 1 hour after peak. It takes about 2 hours to kick in so as the mdma is coming down, the 6-apb kicks in and takes over your roll. <br /><br />You can also eat 10mg of 2c-b around 1 hour after peak. It does the same thing as the 6-apb but with a bit more magic. I prefer 2c-b, much easier to sleep afterward.
