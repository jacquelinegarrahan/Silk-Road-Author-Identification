				Hello,<br /><br />Ever since i was diagnosed with torrets at the age of 6 i have had problems with my face muscles going into spasms. Some times it spreads to the rest of my body when i am tired. I&#039;ve seen many doctors about my condition and have had many contradictory pieces of advice, whilst being prescribed every drug under the sun.<br /><br />I was recently on a coarse of Diazepam but i found my self becoming dependent on it, so i stopped taking them all together. Back when i first started smoking cannabis as a way of relief, but this soon became infective. I have been advised by some of my friends that i should look into Etizolam but after reading up on the drug it seems it has all the same problems associated with it that i had with Diazepam.<br /><br />Does anyone have any good advice about how i should proceed?<br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
