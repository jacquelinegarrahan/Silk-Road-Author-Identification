				Well first of all, a big hello to the members of this community.<br /><br />Just got the necessary push or maybe courage to register myself here after reading these forums maybe for 2-3 months&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So on to my question: A friend of mine is worrying a bit of what&#039;s happening while rolling on mdma. Everything is good and going as expected since we are experience users (with a lot of spacing between the rolls and normal,exercising and healthy diet life) except that he has some red spots on his skin which are not itchy and not very visible but they are still there. However when the roll is over these spots go away. The quality of mdma is not really questionable since it&#039;s happening and happened in every single roll of his life. I&#039;ve searched regarding these issues however people usually report these as staying one week or so and as after effect of rolling, while in this case it&#039;s only while rolling. To my understanding it has something to do with the high blood pressure or something during the session. He doesn&#039;t have any health issues regarding his blood pressure or heart or anything blood related. So my question(s) lies here fellow silkroaders. Is it anything to worry about? And if not, what is the cause of these spots? Will a blood thinner in low dose like an aspirin (or maybe but not sure about vitamin c) work in this case?

				If your friend is changing colors when he does drugs, then I think he should probably stop doing drugs. People, unlike say a banana or other kind of fruit, generally tend to stay a constant color. Eliminate all of the variables, and then you either have a friend with some sort of medical condition, a recessive polka dot gene that is only activated by MDMA, or is a banana.

				Pretty sure he hasn&#039;t transformed into a banana yet&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />It&#039;s not anything serious, meaning there aren&#039;t any other side effects apart from the usual roll-post roll effects.<br /><br />And they are not big. Just some small spots on random places of the body.<br /><br />So my question maybe it&#039;s pretty much medical regarding the blood pressure while on a stimulant.

				I mean, I&#039;ve been watching a lot of Monty Python lately, so I think you should know those fuckin&#039; bananas are dangerous man. be safe. <br /><br />Actually, if you want a pharmacology type answer: baclofen has been shown to lower body temperature in rats on MDMA, and I actually have a bit. <br /><br />That&#039;s just my interpretation.

				He is most likely having an adverse allergic reaction to either the MDMA itself or it&#039;s precursor, safrole, but it could also indicate liver toxicity. How often does your friend use MDMA? Is he a heavy drinker? What drugs does he use often and/or is prescribed to? Is he in shape and does he maintain a healthy diet? We need more information.

				Never had it with MDMA, but got a few under the eyes after some 25i once (it was a chilled trip without dancing or any exertion). They went away after a couple of days.

				Has your friend ever tried any other type of amphetamine such as speed, adderall, or meth? What about other stimulants, I&#039;m guessing coffee doesn&#039;t do this since you would of mentioned that in your post. I&#039;m not sure this would be the result of a blood pressure issue sounds more like an allergy to me but who knows.

				Thanks for the answers.<br /><br />I spoke a bit more to him to clarify and solidify the information.<br /><br />So he never drinks coffee. He maintains a healthy diet and shape. He is not prescribed to any drugs/medicine except from some antibiotics occasionally for winter colds and such. Never got mixed with benzos, opiates, SSRI and so on.<br /><br />Regarding his drug experience 2 years ago or somewhere between that space window he was mixing alcohol, speed and mdma at raves, however this was happening maximum once a month. As for his last rolls they were pretty clean with just mdma in the mix with maybe a beer or a light alcoholic drink. As for his recent roll spacing, he hasn&#039;t done mdma or any other drugs (apart from alcohol) for the last 2 months (last time red spots also appeared) then previous one was 2 more months ago and before that 1 more month. I&#039;d say he is in the safe zone regarding spacing between sessions.<br /><br />If he, on rare cases, did only speed there weren&#039;t red spot. Same goes for coke. Never consumed aderall or meth.<br /><br />As for the alcohol consumption that would be 1-2 times per week varying from being just tipsy to be completely smashed.<br /><br />About the spots when they appear there would be some light red spots and some heavier red. The light ones disappear after some hours while the others, the next day. They are not itchy and he doesn&#039;t feel anything strange when touching them. More or less he would have 5-6 of these spots each time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve checked about the liver toxicity but wouldn&#039;t that be indicated if there were pimples or rashes ? Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

A good way to test this would be to take a very low dose (10-20mg) and note if he experiences the same adverse reactions. Please note, however, that I am NOT a doctor and this information is based solely on my pharmaceutical knowledge and years of MDMA research.

				This happens to me once and awhile, little red spots showing around my right knee and then disappearing the next day. This also happens to me when I sweat profusely, sometimes when I take a very long hot shower I&#039;ll notice a few pop up. I think it has more to do with the body overheating than any serious chemical reaction. That&#039;s just my $0.02 though

				Not trying to do a shameless plug but look into my baclofen listing and read some medical review papers on baclofen and body temperature in rats on MDMA.

				ok so pretty much narrowing down to three cases.<br /><br />Either severe liver damage, which I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the case since there would be other health problems also I think<br /><br />or a mild allergic reaction to the drug itself or one of it&#039;s procursors, the most possible cause in my opinion<br /><br />or an effect from the high body temperature (not quite sure about that, any documentation would be helpfull)<br /><br />so basically a small dose of 10-20mg will determine if it&#039;s an allergic reaction or not?

				are you pale?&nbsp; i am very light skinned and i get red spots on my body after a hot bath, exercise or when I have to do public speaking.&nbsp; maybe try working out and taking a hot shower and see if you get the same spots.&nbsp; <br /><br />mdma definitely raises your body temperature, and even more so when you mix it with uppers like speed or coke.

				Well I don&#039;t think body temperature is the case actually..wouldn&#039;t the same thing happen with speed or coke?<br /><br />And nop, he is not pale, I have some pale friends and they get red all the times from workout, being anxious and such so it&#039;s not a normal high bloodstream-change of colour.<br /><br />Here it may be something regarding the mdma&#039;s reaction to the body as it seems.

				Yes, ephedrone, a 10-20mg dose should help you determine if it&#039;s an allergic reaction. Keep us updated.

				No it wouldn&#039;t be the same with speed or coke.&nbsp; It never happens to me with either of those.&nbsp; If you think it is a reaction take a benadryl next time you roll and see if it helps.&nbsp; Are the spots raised or flat?&nbsp; If it is an allergic reaction they will be like welts on your face or trunk, if it is overheating then it will be splotches in various shapes in random places.<br /><br />Are you trying to do some type of &quot;SWIM&quot; thing here?&nbsp; Or is this really for a freind?&nbsp; There is no need to do the whole swim thing here, Tor is anonymous, and it is a myth that the swim thing will provide any type of protection.&nbsp; The cops all know what it means.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope you get it sorted out, keep us posted.

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />Yes it&#039;s really for a friend, I am well aware of Tor anonymity&nbsp; if it was for me I could describe the case more accurately I think&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The spots are flat, no difference whatsoever with the with the rest of the skin apart from the colour.<br /><br />Anyway when we acquire some good quality moly just before Christmas festivals, will do this test with a low dose.<br /><br />Will post an update on that.
