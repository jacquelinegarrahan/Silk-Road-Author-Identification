				AFAIK, the most useful is testosterone, but there are different forms of it and I can tell you which is better.<br />Some steroids will reduce your balls size. When you stop taking them they will go back to their normal size though.However, the actual danger with steroids is liver damage.<br />There are other chems used to block androgen becoming estrogen thus avoiding some of their side effects.<br />There is a Steroids section in bluelight, they will know better.

				Steroids aside, an ECA stack can help give you some oomph.

				hey man.&nbsp; There is alot to know about steroids before you start using. Do a few months of research and then find the gear that will help you achieve your goals and go from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Typically a beginners stack is just 500mg of test per week for 12 weeks..&nbsp; &nbsp; This will get you 20ibs of lean body mass if your diet and training is right.<br /><br />Orals will fuck up your liver, but injectables are well tolerated.

				Not all orals are highly toxic to the liver. Anavar would be an example of one that places limited strain on the liver, at least as far as orals go. It won&#039;t produce the same gains as an injectable like test-e or test-prop would though.<br /><br />I highly recommend picking up a book Chemical Muscle Enhancement to learn more. There&#039;s also a forum called The Source Check with a lot of knowledge members who can help guide you down the right path for your goals.
