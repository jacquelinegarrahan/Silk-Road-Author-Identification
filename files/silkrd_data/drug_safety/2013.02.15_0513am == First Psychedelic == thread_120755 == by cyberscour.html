				What would be a good introduction to psychedelics? I have only done marijuana and MDMA, but I&#039;d like to move on to a real psychedelic. I&#039;ve been thinking that a threshold dose of 2C-B would be the best way to start, because of it&#039;s gentle experience that doesn&#039;t overwhelm you with hallucinations and its reported effects that were similar to MDMA, but anything else I should take into consideration? I want to experience a psychedelic, but preferably something weak to start out.

				My first psychedelic was 800 ug of 25C Nbome it does not have much of a mind fuck and was pretty easy to hand but if you want to experience a bit of the mind fuck I would reccommend 2 grams of shroms or a hit or 2 of LSD (depending on the quality) just remember to have fun and be safe peace and love :)

				I agree with Pax. Mushrooms are pretty forgiving and 1.5-2g of that in a nice setting should be a nice way to get your feet wet. That said, I don&#039;t have much experience with some of the newer RCs so one may be a better step in but mushrooms have been pretty nice for me. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Agreed take one of classics LSD or Shrooms or mescaline.<br /><br />RC&#039;s are just not really prodicing a worthwhile trip.<br /><br />Go with a low/medium dose ( 1.5 - 2 g shrooms or about 100-150 ug LSD ) with good friends or alone in a safe place and you should have a great time.

				The best way to start is not with a specific product, <br /><br />but with a good guide, a good set and a good setting! <br />That&#039;s more important when you go psychedelic than the product you are using. <br /><br />With a good guide, set and setting I would say LSD is probably on of the best possible thing&#039;s to try. <br /><br />Finding a good guide isn&#039;t easy, <br />but it&#039;s certainly worth it. <br /><br />If I&#039;d know you I&#039;d be wiling to do that for you, <br />I&#039;ve done it a few times allready and everyone was always very happy. <br />Both new users and experienced users always said it was the best experience they ever had...<br />so I&#039;m quite shure it&#039;s worth looking for someone who can do this for you...<br /><br />Also, do some research in advance (read some books/watch some documentaries). <br />Fadiman is a good author to read before starting your experiences...

				Rafael5 hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />But I will add another dynamic to it: Genealogy.<br /><br />You need to have a positive, relaxed setting, but also you need to be sure that you have no family history of Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. From my experience, I have seen people with personality disorders have an absolutely horrific experience which even affected those around them. Even if you are just an angry person in general, psychedelics (this is particularly aimed at LSD) will magnify those negative traits and can lock you in a bad trip for hours and leave you with some horrible memories.<br /><br />Even if this were the case, I could say try psilocybin first. As opposed to LSD, mushrooms typically come with a dose of euphoria to the eye candy they induce. They give you a bit of euphoria and also the OEV&#039;s.<br /><br />And as commonly known, stay away from anti-depressants and even some painkillers. First off, mixing chems is a serious thing to consider and you want to prepare accordingly or avoid altogether with some mixtures. But with psychedelics in particular this won&#039;t be so much a physical danger to dying, but more of a danger to the mind. I had a friend who mixed mushrooms with I believe it was trazodone and he blacked out and ended up destroying his house and even harming his wife.<br /><br />Good luck, op. And good on you for asking questions first. I know when I was a kid I just took it and went with it. Fortunately never found myself too bad of a situation like some of my friends around me.

In my opinion, LSD itself isn&#039;t euphoric and they only positive excitement you may feel is that of knowing you&#039;re about to trip. In my experience, LSD actually emphasizes the emotions you already feel. Therefore if you&#039;re in a positive mood and are excited about having a fun trip, then you may have a magnified affect of this. On the other hand, if you are stressed out in life, or feeling depressed, or anything negative then the drug may exaggerate that as well. Which is why it&#039;s said to not drop acid if you&#039;re not in a good mood, as it may render even your safe comfort zones as a personal hell for 6 to 8 hours.<br /><br />Or if you candy flip with ecstasy pills off the street and take LSD at the same time. Only had horrible experiences with that as the street ex is usually laced with methamphetamine and wears off quickly. This leaves you in a crashed state while the LSD is still going strong. More horrible experience I have ever had with it, personally.

				I&#039;ve taken LSD about 300 times.<br /><br />Yeah, it gives me a distinctive euphoria. I can separate the mental euphoria from the purely physical.<br /><br />LSD gives me a bodily euphoria in addition to the mental euphoria.<br /><br />It&#039;s a feeling of electrical energy coursing through my body. I can feel it in my legs, groin, arms, hands, and head. It&#039;s a very distinctive physical euphoria that only LSD gives me.<br /><br />It&#039;s not an emotional state.

				Check out the new-ish 2CB thread if your inclinations are going that way - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.0<br /><br />Sounds very positive and predictable if you watch your dose. I haven&#039;t yet tried it so cannot speak from experience.<br /><br />Based strictly off personal experience, I would say shrooms, at the 2g level as suggested by others. But 2CB sounds like a promising alternative.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t mess with nbomes whatsoever until you&#039;ve toured the classics and can compare.
