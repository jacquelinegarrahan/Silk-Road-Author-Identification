				hello. question about the canadian oxy neo formulation that is for the purpose of abuse prevention. you cant crush it, cook it etc. and its slow release. it just forms a gel if you try to do any of that. for example, in water, or in your nasal cavity.<br /><br />does anyone have a protocol for circumventing the abuse prevention formulation in oxy neo- and can you explain to me the chemistry of why it works?<br /><br />i&#039;ve found a few &#039;protocols&#039; for &#039;unlocking&#039; the pills on the internet. the purpose is to get rid of the time release qualities, and to be able to crush it for insufflation.<br /><br />so- to my question- do you guys here have some better information? the most common one i&#039;ve read is grinding it into a powder, heating it in a broiler until it turns light brown, and then you&#039;re supposed to be able to insufflate it without it forming a glue in your nasal cavity. my question is- do you guys believe this? have you heard of different protocols? i just dont really believe this protocol works because it seems that the purpose is to exploit differences in melting temperatures of the ingredients, but a brief look at the mp&#039;s of the ingredients dont support this hypothesis. any suggestions/thoughts?<br /><br />i understand that different reaction products of the following reagents could have different mp&#039;s than the reagents themselves, does anyone have this information? <br /><br />so to really simplify my question:does anyone have a protocol for circumventing the abuse prevention formulation in oxy neo- and can you explain to me the chemistry of why it works?<br /><br />oxy neo ingredients<br /><br />butylated hydroxytoluene<br />hypromellose<br />polyethylene glycol<br />polyethylene oxide<br />magnesium stearate<br />titanium dioxide<br />hydroxypropyl cellulose<br />iron oxide<br />polysorbate<br />silicon dioxide<br /><br />

				You&#039;ll probably be better off searching or asking a forum specifically for opiates.<br /><br />I will say, and you probably know this, that oxycodone has a higher bioavailability taken orally than it does when snorted. Also, even though oxycodone itself is active, it partially metabolized into oxymorphine which is much stronger. Point being, letting it go through first pass metabolism may not be a bad thing. I don&#039;t think there will be any simple way to defeat its mechanisms... It might be best to leave this one alone. I heard of a story where a girl was grinding these up with a cheese grater or something and snorting them with no extraction. She eventually couldn&#039;t breathe well and had to go to the emergency room... The doctors said, after x-rays, that it looked like she had been snorting cement. You know how tough those things are... Imagine that building up in your sinuses! Now take this with a grain of salt(I never understood where this expression came from) because I heard this &quot;third-hand&quot; and have no way of validating the story.<br /><br />If you are just trying to satisfy your need to snort things, maybe, pop the oxy and snort something else? If you already have a habit, maybe heroin could be an alternative. If you&#039;re not dependent or addicted, it might not be the best move. Definitely will save you tons of money compared to overpriced oxy... Unless you&#039;re getting a script...
