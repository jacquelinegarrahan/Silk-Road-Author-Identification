				I&#039;m trying to find out if it&#039;s time for me to move on to harder things. At this point one 30mg oxy doesn&#039;t do ANYTHING to me. Two of them does some but to really get that old kick I need three. Shits too expensive.<br /><br />So I started trying methadone. I liked how cost effective it is. But now it takes like 25mg to really do it for me. and it doesn&#039;t really feel as good as the OC&#039;s did either.<br /><br />Is it time to try heroin? I&#039;ve considered injecting it subcutaneously, I&#039;m too much of a pussy to IV it but is subcutaneous almost as strong? Is it something an amateur could do without fucking up their circulatory system?

				I&#039;ve never done heroin, so I can&#039;t give any advice regarding whether it&#039;s time to switch..<br />However, I can tell you that the last thing you want to do is shoot it subcutaneously, abscesses are a bitch to deal with, especially when you&#039;re constantly going to the doctor because of them. If you&#039;re going to do Heroin at all, I&#039;d recommend smoking it, or (if nothing else) injecting IM. It&#039;s a slower process (5-10 mins before effects), but it&#039;s better than subcutaneous or IV injections. One last thing, PLEASE use a clean needle every time, Please. That is my only request if you are to start using heroin (besides ordering the best quality available!!)<br /><br />Hopefully someone can recommend other opioids other than Heroin (hopefully).<br /><br />best of luck,<br />sdesu<br />

				Hi, <br /><br />I would really not suggest Methadone.&nbsp; Of all the opiates methadone is a little different.&nbsp; The reason it is used for the treatment of opiate addiction is the long duration of its effects.&nbsp; It is actually harder to get off methadone than it is heroin, so if you aren&#039;t using it for maintenance at a methadone clinic, I would say stick to something else.<br /><br />Oxycodone and other opiates of that class are actually stronger than morphine, heroin and a number of other regular opiates.&nbsp; They can increase your tolerance very quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used to do OP 80&#039;s back when you could simply crush them and then snort or iv them.&nbsp; The WD&#039;s I had when I would run out of those were much worse then when I switched to H.<br /><br />Are you already stuck in an opiate cycle, doing them every day? <br /><br />I would say H is your best bet if you are looking to be able to adjust your dose more efficiently and still get a decent high.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that if you start doing this shit every day and you run out, be prepared for some bad days to follow.<br /><br />I would not suggest subcutaneous, simply because you are much more likely to get an infection from that than you would simply IV&#039;ing it, but if you make sure you use sterilized water, new syringes and choose different spots you should be OK.<br /><br />You will not get the rush you get from IV&#039;ing it going the sub route though.&nbsp; IV&#039;ing it will hit you within 10-60 seconds whereas subing it will take 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />Overall H is also a cheaper buy.&nbsp; So long as you don&#039;t go looking for that rush every 30 minutes, 50mg of H can last you 6-8 hours initially.&nbsp; Just remember, the more you do, the more you need to do, your tolerance goes up with every hit.&nbsp; If you are doing 50mg several times a day, by the third day you will probably need to start doing 75-100mg to get the same high.<br />&nbsp;

				The following represents my experienceonly. YMMV<br /><br />I&#039;m a little coked out right now from a party, so this may end up a bit of&nbsp; a ramble. For that, I apologize.<br />The only drugs I have been certifiably addicted to were prescription opiates, and it took less than 3 weeks to get to that point.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t today&#039;s trendy drugs, just plain old morphine/dilaudid and Ativan for muscle cramps.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t have to tell you how lows the lows get when you aren&#039;t able to procure.&nbsp; There wasn&#039;t an emergency room in my town that didn&#039;t know my history by the end. I ER shopped every other day, even re-breaking an old limb break to score from an ER about half an hour away.<br />Opiate euphoria is incomparable to any other drug I&#039;ve tried, and I&#039;ve done them all in one shape or another.&nbsp; My best advice is get off the pandas ASAP. Oxys are going&nbsp; to be in ever shorter supply, and if you switch to Horse, you go from pharmaceutical grade&nbsp; medicine to god knows what cuts, track marks, dirty pins, dirty people etc etc.&nbsp; Insufflation of H. is so much less an experience than mainlining, that you&#039;ll move to that eventually.&nbsp; <br />Here&#039;s how I kicked my opiate addiction without rehab or intervention.&nbsp; Doda (poppy tea).&nbsp; You can buy dried pods just about anywhere of papaver somniferum, and its very easy to brew weaker and weaker tea (move from pods to stems over a period of several weeks). It tastes terrible, it still get&#039;s you high as fuck, and will push you past the joneseing edge.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you why it was so effective, maybe the other alkaloids helped wean off it easier, but it saved my life. You can even grow them yourself if you like,&nbsp; Hens &amp; Chicks and Afghan White are the strongest pods.<br />Stay off the pony, taper the oxy&#039;s you have left and start drinking tea.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be happy and chatty, and before you know it, totally kicked of the habit**<br /><br />**NB: Respect this plant. It&#039;s raw opium pure and simple, and if you don&#039;t actively taper and continue to do more, you will be double fucked.

				Just keep in mind, as ChaxChax said,&nbsp; that the Doda&#039;s can be just as addictive as the rest of the opiates.&nbsp; You may just be trading one opiate for another, and doda can be just as hard to find sometimes as any opiate.&nbsp; Up here in Canada they sell the stuff in certain Afghan grocery stores, which get busted occasionally.&nbsp; It&#039;s big with the taxi drivers up here.<br /><br />After not being able to find anything, too many times, I discovered poppy tea myself, but using poppy seeds.&nbsp; You need to get them from a bulk supplier, someone who sells bulk foods.&nbsp; There are many recipes on the web for it.<br /><br />They totally get rid of the WD&#039;s (at least for me they did) and they even gave me a buzz.&nbsp; Now I find it easier to do opiates for off and on for a week or so, then take the tea to level off back to normal, without having to go through any WD&#039;s.<br /><br />Poppy seeds are much lower in opiates than doda, so you need at least 1-2lbs to make a decent tea that will do anything.<br /><br />

				Hi, sorry, for some reason I didn&#039;t see your reply until now.<br /><br />About the only way you can lower your tolerance is to simply stop taking opiates.&nbsp; If you want to go into withdrawal right away, a hit of suboxone will do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s the other drug they use to get you off opiates but unlike methadone you can only start taking it when you are already into the WD&#039;s.&nbsp; If you take it with any opiates in your system it will end up putting you into withdrawal before you are ready for it (not than anyone is really ready to go into withdrawal).<br /><br />My suggestion to you would be to just cut back on what you are taking, not enough at first to put you into the WD&#039;s, but enough to start weening off.&nbsp; Eventually you will get back to the point where one 30mg Roxy will get you high. <br /><br />H might seem like a better alternative but honestly it could end up costing you ten times as much as the few roxy&#039;s you have been taking.&nbsp; Lets say you purchased 1g of H.&nbsp; Unless you have an iron will chances are you would end up going through that gram in several days to a week at most.&nbsp; Now you are out and you start feeling like crap, all you want is to start feeling better again, so you end up buying more H, but this time you buy 2g&#039;s, figuring it will last longer.&nbsp; You tell yourself you are just going to do one or two hits a day, just enough to get a rush and keep the WD&#039;s away.&nbsp; The problem is that this doesn&#039;t work for most people.&nbsp; You look at all that H you have and say to yourself, I&#039;ll just do a bit more and before you know it, that 2g&#039;s is gone as well.<br /><br />Unless you have something to fall back on, like methadone, this can be a viscous cycle, you can never stop because if you do you start felling like crap and all you want is for it to stop, so you end up buying more (if you can find it and if you have the cash to buy it).<br /><br />I played that game for years until I went on meth.&nbsp; Now I can order a g or two, enjoy myself for a bit and then fall back on the meth so I don&#039;t end up in withdrawals.&nbsp; It&#039;s not perfect, and I am slowly working my meth dose down to the point I will have to stop altogether, but it&#039;s better than having to go through the WD&#039;s very 3 or 4 weeks because there was nothing around or I was short of cash.<br /><br />So, if you are thinking of trying out H, just be careful.&nbsp; As far as doing it IM instead of via IV, you run the chance of infections when you go the IM route, so always think &#039;sterile&#039; when you are doing it via IM.&nbsp; Always use a new syringe, always clean the site with an alcohol pad, use sterile water to mix the H in and always use a filter to get rid of any contaminants that may be in the H.

				As a couple people mentioned, don&#039;t SC heroin. If you&#039;re going to use a needle, just IV. The risk for abscesses is a lot greater with IM and SC than IV, plus heroin really hurts if you miss a vein.<br /><br />You should also know that once you try IV heroin, nothing else will feel as nice. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so addictive, but even if you don&#039;t get addicted, it will take a little bit of the fun out of other opiates. If you&#039;re going to IV, I&#039;d suggest *religiously* following the 8/72 rule: don&#039;t use for more than 8 hours at a time, and wait a minimum of 72 hours before you use again. I&#039;ve used IV opiates for several years, and by following that rule, I&#039;ve never come to a point where I was even close to being addicted.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not addicted yet, I&#039;d suggest just quitting all opiates for a month or so, and then once you go back (even if it&#039;s just to oxy) following the 8/72 rule for that as well. It keeps your tolerance pretty low, and helps you not to get addicted.<br /><br />And finally, if you do use a needle, start off slow. Just use 5mg or less, and work up from there until you find out how much it takes to make you feel the way you want to. You can always take more, but once you push that plunger, there&#039;s no going back. Also, you should do that for each batch of heroin you buy, even from the same vendor. Unlike oxy, the potency can (and does) vary a lot, and a dose of one batch that gets you comfortably high could kill you with another batch.<br /><br />As a side note, I&#039;d suggest staying away from the vendor OPI. I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve seen them or not, but there are a couple current threads that seem to indicate he might be becoming a scammer, or at least sketch and unreliable.<br /><br />Good luck!
