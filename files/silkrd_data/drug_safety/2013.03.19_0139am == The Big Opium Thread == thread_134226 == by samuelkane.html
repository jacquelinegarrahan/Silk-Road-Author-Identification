				i got some opium off the scurvy crew, its good stuff.<br /><br />tried the glass pipe first, epic fail - now i need a new one :P<br /><br />tried hot-knife, worked well.<br /><br />i didn&#039;t weigh what i burnt, but estimated it to be a ~100mg ball (i got a gram total) - produced a shitload of white smoke.<br /><br />sucked it in and held it as long as i could, did that 3 times and i was buzzing nicely :) <br /><br />if anyone has any other methods for smoking this, i&#039;d also like to hear them...

				The opium really stinks though, because of its raw state, basically vegetable matter all clumped together, smells like grass-catcher off a lawnmower ;) <br /><br />But to The Scurvy Crews credit, they stealth it up like a MF and you cant smell shit till the final layer...

				....Here&#039;s a few observations i&#039;d thought i&#039;d share......I lukily had a chance to try opium over 25 yrs ago...Remembered the experience well...and absolutly loved it .....Fast forward to last month...I was on vacation in a Asian country...I was able <br />to get some opium......Here&#039;s some onservations...The first kind i had was apparantly &quot;Raw&quot; opium....This was dark brown&nbsp; in color and smelled just like soap or flowers.....Now when buying it on vacation ,,,I got what appears to be &quot;processed&quot; opium...This didn&#039;t have the flowery smell...But was dark/black..Whereas the raw was a super dark brown.....<br /><br />To be honest each person is different .I compare all my opiate experiences to oxycontin,because it is my most used and favorite.I smoked quite a bit ,and i didn&#039;t really like it that much...I found it to be a very &quot;dark&quot; high..If that makes any sense.(makes sense if you look at the old opium den pictures)..It gets me high ,but doesn&#039;t really make me happy..But thats what its supposed to do i suppose...You tend to wanna be by yourself ,in a quiet area.Without loud noises, or lots of people ..Also processed vs raw could be a slightly different experience as well .it had been many years so i couln&#039;t really compare..<br /><br />I also tried the morphine sulphate ,and didn&#039;t enjoy that either.I found i couln&#039;t really function on it .And it made me feel kinda of stupid..But can you really compare pharm op&#039;s to natural ones?....Your mileage may vary ,and it may be exactly what your looking for....So enjoy,and have fun!!

				Heya, <br />&nbsp;It really depends on the person, generally it wont hurt if hot knifed, usually to start about a 1/10 of a gram, using a normal hot knife method.

				Just an update/redaction on what I posted above, 100mg is a little too much to be hot knifing in one lungful (for me, ymmv). After weighing each load, they came out to ~50mg balls (about 5mm diameter balls) just roll it up between your fingers. You can also scrape the black residue off the knife once it cools down and burn it again.<br /><br />This is some really nice opium :) I&#039;ll definitely be back for more. I can&#039;t wait to try the extra potent Bayer opium that they offer.
