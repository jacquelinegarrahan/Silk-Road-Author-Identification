				Washed 700mg of UK street or pub style coke - the coke that 90% of users generally end up with.<br /><br />I done an acetone wash by putting the coke in a small glass vial with 30ml of acetone. I stirred this for a few mins and left for a while, smoked a joint, and stirred again. I should add the vial had a top on to stop any moisture getting in.<br /><br />The acetone was anhydrous . I also poured 50 ml on a saucer to see if there was any residue. We need pure acetone! We can make it anhydrous with ease if needs be.<br /><br />So I poured the coke acetone into a filter which was on a homer made wire holder. I used an eye dropper to put about 30 ml through the coke - more than enough to get out the nasty stuff.<br /><br />The results confirm to me that UK coke is really shit. I have not bought UK coke for years. This was just a one off in the 420 sale. got 600mg and got 200mg free.<br /><br />The result of the wash is in a photo but its amazing because the waste from this coke, the stuff that was left when the acetone was gone, looks like meth shards!<br /><br />I will weight the results tomorrow but when I dropped some of the coke into bleach it gave a reddish orange color after it settled on the bottom! This is a supposed simple test to see if speed is in coke but i need it reconfirmed.<br /><br />I am having trouble uploading photos despite being small file size - if any mod can help please do! I just donated a BTC to a mod so it is ironic that I actually need one to help me!<br /><br />I will post this up and have my meta scrubbed photo waiting to go up.<br /><br />Also - just in - the results of washing 900mg of Sesampino coke!<br /><br />Amazing thing is all the acetone took away (and it was a pro wash) was some oily looking stuff that is hardening like some gloop. Very pale yellow color. I have lost barely any of the actual coke and used a good 100ml or so acetone to wash it really well!<br /><br />Will also put those results up. <br /><br />Of course an acetone wash alone does not mean you have prime coke left. there are other things that other chemicals can clean out.<br /><br />Can an admin help me with image uploading - says folder is full! Please!

				I&#039;m all set for washing too... Got all the stuff ready to go! 48hrs huh Duke... Cool, when it air dries like that do you have any smell left on it?<br /><br />Oh and I&#039;m doing the additional adding of Epsom salts to the Acetone to ensure it&#039;s totally anhydrous!!

				If you can get chloroform and diethyl ether then you can was with them which will remove pretty much any other impurities left after the acetone. Not 100% sure which, if any, solvent dissolves levamisole and not cocaine but doing anhydrous acetone followed by diethyl ether should get you as clean a product as you have ever had. Unless you lived in Miami in the 80s of course...

				chloroform - that&#039;s the one, not formaldehyde. <br /><br />and DK - there&#039;s no smell from the actual coke, or there weren&#039;t on mine, but you could still taste that cokey taste.<br /><br />tell ya, once you&#039;ve done it once you won&#039;t like doing unwashed coke any more. i only do it now if i&#039;m pissed up and cant get hold of anything else

				Can someone give us a url for the onion uploader.<br /><br />Found one but it is not working anymore.<br /><br />The photo WILL shock all UK coke buyers.<br /><br />I have done 2 washes now.<br /><br />The UK coke was awful!<br /><br />To remove speed its ether alcohol also anhydrous.<br /><br />You can get &#039;clear-water vodka&#039; in the USA and extract the pure ether..<br /><br />You can buy pure acetone online on the big sites.<br /><br />Always add the Epsom salts which you bake for two hours at 400 degrees. <br /><br />PS - if you leave the coke in the filter it will come out as solid block. Chop this up asap to allow the acetone to be purged.<br /><br />leaving the powdered washed coke for 24 hr in about 77 degrees is fine. <br /><br />And there is no smell!<br /><br />Got like 2 lines of the UK coke left from 700mg! Got 100mg left to wash but that will leave a mere line of charlie.<br /><br />Sesampinos coke wash was one in which the loss was 100mg of some oily stuff which smelt like plastic when I put a flame to it. Seems to be the crap the South Americans leave in - missing out the good acetone wash! They would have an extra 100 grams of &#039;coke&#039; if they never washed the coke 100%. Money rules so looks like washing coke is the only way to go.<br /><br />Glad a few replied. hope to have the photo evidence up as soon as I get the url.<br /><br />Red.

				Yeah that sounds close to what I&#039;ve heard about the cocaine in the UK.<br /><br />Here in Florida its not that bad but I have tried some absolute crap. At times the quality is actually very good but it was mixed with a lot of filler. If I had done a simple acetone was I&#039;m sure it would have been much better.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to have to try sesampino&#039;s blow then because that color/texture sounds awesome. <br /><br />Soft yellow coke rules. <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m VERY impressed with sesampinos coke.<br /><br />Not tried the washed coke I got in the sale yet (the coke I washed myself)<br /><br />Only tried the unwashed &#039;fishscale&#039; and snorted two 25mg lines - then wrapped 100mg in a rolling paper and swallowed it with a drink. I was feeling mellow, very chatty and very affectionate towards the love of my life. I went out 10,00pm came in at 2,00am and never touched any more as I was still high. Had a few drinks also so that kind of mellowed the high.<br /><br />Look forward to the washed but will wait till a suitable occasion. I did test some of the fish-scale sitting in on my lonesome - hit me harder without the booze but this was a smooth high - a euphoria and just feeling &#039;right&#039;. Really enjoyed it.<br /><br />If you done 500mg of this you would be partying in a serious manner. Too much really, You don&#039;t feel the need to keep going back to fiend.<br /><br />Next day felt fine.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />By the way the url of http://hccrkf7ja6io7ygo.onion/&nbsp; for uploading images is not working!<br /><br />Nor is the other onion image site I found.<br /><br />I guess only vendors get upload folders.<br /><br />Would be nice to have one for us on the forum also! After all its drug safety and harm reduction. Most people will NOT believe the shit in UK coke till they see it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be buying a few more cokes to test but not under my user name. There are some good deals here right now with cheap coke. Its possible the coke in there can be extracted but we need ether really and chloroform for ephedrine I think. <br /><br />A acetone wash will do for speed also. Just done one - Speed Docktors &#039;yellow&#039;. Got to say it looks bad when you see the crap that comes out of the wash. Not sure what it is. But to be fair only 120 mg of &#039;crap&#039; came out. The remaining speed has no smell nor much taste. Will do a report on the amphetamine forum, rumour mill.<br /><br />There are few bad vendors on SR who do not even know their drugs. Maybe not even testing them. I think doing a few washes and publishing results is the best way forward.<br /><br />I will look at the cheap deals with UK coke vendors here. Some have astoundingly cheap deals. We are talking grams of coke at 7-8 bit coins. If you can get a gram out of an English 8-ball (3.5 grams) then it would be worth buying the cheaper coke.<br /><br />That said - I like sesampinios. True there may be better out there, but this guy always delivers. Packing is second to none.<br /><br />I&#039;d sooner pay £100 for a gram of coke which I&#039;d only need 100mg of to chill out. If I was at some crazy party on 200mg&nbsp; 8 25mg lines spaced out every two hours. I&#039;d be feeling so damn good!<br /><br />Kind of equal to E in some ways - its NOT all &#039;me me me&#039;. Unlike E you a lot less battered the next day and do not get that suicide Tuesday. Your are more &#039;cool&#039; than being on MDMA. You can hold your own at ANY social event. No insane look!<br /><br />Thing is its VERY good and VERY easy to use. I can see why people get addicted to it. If you can treat yourself to a few grams each year that is about the best way to roll with coke. For me a gram of top quality coke is enough. As stated before I been the USA have some Mexican family tie so have had some brilliant coke there but think the Mex cartels smuggle from a lot of South American nations so I might be using any coke from any nation. People say coke causes violence. Actually its making illegal that does that. Make meat illegal and people would be getting murdered over 5 tons of beef.<br /><br />Tempting though it is to blast a couple of lines of coke today I am being a good boy. Got some of the speed doks speed off a pal who says he has the &#039;decent batch&#039;. Mine was so bad I washed it down the sink after ingesting 1.5 grams and feeling basically nothing much to call home over. Should have been partying for 24 hrs! Anyways peoples I washed this speed with acetone and baked the actual speed what was left for a fast purge of the acetone. The speed now has little smell. The crap that came of it would have been ruining your nose. I will do a full report on the amphetamine reports in the rumour mill when I use it.<br /><br />And as for the link to the drugs forum wash by Le Junk (Google it) that guide is THE best out there. I&#039;ve read a few and read some stupid ones.<br /><br />In the UK you can get a gram of &#039;coke&#039; for £25 - £30 in many areas. Thing is your paying basically for 10% of coke mixed in with 90% rubbish rubbish. So a &#039;pure&#039; gram of coke off your local pub or street dealer would actually cost you £250. you would need to wash it to extract the cuts - and you may need 3 chemicals to deal with it. Acetone and ether will get most of the UK cuts. It will get the speed if its there. Anyone buying coke and getting speed as a cut will feel like shit the next day.<br /><br />The MAIN reason coke became popular was because when we used speed on a Friday and Saturday night we felt bad for days afterwards. Good coke you should be able to use Friday and Saturday, leave it out Sunday - and on Monday you will be feeling ok. Better than if you had just drank 5 pints both nights.<br /><br />For UK vendors of coke I would say that if any can actually get to the likely 50% already cut stamped blocks - then washing that 50% out would make customers actually praise the coke and choose it for special occasions. Good coke is very social. People fight on UK coke! They get agitated. The coke off sesampino - the fishscale - you would have sworn enemies shaking hands and chatting about letting things be. I felt NO animosity on that whatsoever!<br /><br />Like I say - UK coke - for most its 10%, We pay £250 or so (if we pay £25 a gram)<br /><br />Coke IS expensive because there is a limited supply and more people using it all over the world. <br /><br />I would have said paying almost £100 for some real coke would be stupid. <br /><br />I still say that coke as high as 30BTC is expensive. But having tasted it I think I&#039;ve actually experienced a REAL coke high. Nothing like the amped up paranoid rubbish served up in the UK. <br /><br />Like anything in life you pay for quality. Love and friendship are free but if you want that fine meal or a bottle of that expensive Scotch you pay the premium because its good to treat yourself sometimes.<br /><br />Just be VERY careful with washing coke. Many UK people will discover WHY this is so addictive! It does make you feel great! So be careful. Limit your usage. Use very few months and a little bit goes a long long way. Use for special occasions. <br /><br />If we all washed the coke we bought then some coke dealers here would be losing a LOT of custom VERY fast. No loss to SR as other vendors will learn to wash and there is so much demand for quality coke that the market can only keep growing.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />Check out the Le Junk wash method.

				Washed the last 100mg or so of the UK coke I had. What remains is maybe 10mg from that. <br /><br />I put the used bag into a glass of bleach and water and the inside of the bag turned red! That is an easy test to discover other &#039;caines&#039;<br /><br />A buddy who went half with me for the vanishing Tony of Canada coke now wants an 8 ball so my women is dropping hints about us making it up to 5 grams which is &#039;economic sense&#039;.<br /><br />There are cheaper options than Sesampino but I got to vouch for his fishscale and will report on the top quality batch which I washed and extracted a yellow waxy, oily substance leaving 900mg or so of white crystal looking powder. I have not touched that so far.<br /><br />I would not wash the fishscale personally. The price is 30 BTC which seems crazy. But if 100mg does you for a night and you leave it for special occasions it is value for money. Cheaper than champagne! UK coke users who snort one gram of UK coke may find that 100mg of real coke not only lasts the night but makes you feel fantastic. For me it beats MDMA because you can function on cocaine if you need to. It is benign in small doses. No come down. No next day or day after wipe out. <br /><br />The quality coke would be better with a wash but I will report in full this weekend as a work colleague is leaving and its a special occasion!<br /><br />Of all the vendors on here sesampino went out of his way to sort me out&nbsp; :) I will stick with him for being so nice to me but make no mistake, if I ordered some coke from him and got some jittery UK style paranoia promoting, impotence powder I would report it.<br /><br />If this was hash I would try new vendors. Give a new vendor a chance to prove some new hash is good. But with coke I do so little that most coke users I know think I don&#039;t use as I always refuse lines (unless in the USA).<br /><br />PS Still not found anywhere anon to upload photos! I took some good ones that would help SR in harm reduction.<br /><br /><br />

Of course, everything &quot;depends&quot; but a couple years back, the labrat did a wash on his friend&#039;s generously-donated coke. He found it was no more than 10% pure. At 60 a gram, that&#039;s some expensive baking soda.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I would highly avoid any Acetone used for Nail Polish remover, it generally has other additives. You want straight Acetone. I would think that any hardware store would carry it. Then add the Baked Epsom salt and leave it in there for ~24 hours to remove any water that&#039;s in the Acetone. (making Anhydrous Acetone, remember a tiny amount of water will dissolve all the Cocaine Hcl)<br /><br />Follow Redallover/Le-Junks acetone wash, and whala!&nbsp; OR if you can find Everclear ~191 Proof Alcohol, that does a good wash as well it sounds like.
