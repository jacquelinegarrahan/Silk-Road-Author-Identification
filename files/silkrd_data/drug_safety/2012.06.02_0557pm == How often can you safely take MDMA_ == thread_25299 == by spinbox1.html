				So what do you guys think?&nbsp; I know this can vary a lot depending on the person, dose, etc.<br /><br />I think Shulgin said once every 3 months was the most it should be used. Sometimes I hear from other people like once a month or once every 2 weeks.<br /><br />Lately I have been rolling about once a week and I usually take between 100 to 150 mg of Molly.&nbsp; Sometimes I&#039;ll take 1 or 2 weeks off.<br /><br />I always pre and post load with 5HTP, alpha-lipoic acid, magnesium, and I take Tryptamine&#039;s MindFood or ThinkDeep Pills.&nbsp; While rolling I try to eat an orange for Vitamin C or take Camu Camu powder.&nbsp; I also eat a Pomegranate, blueberries, and dark chocolate because of the anti-oxidants. (If you have tips for good foods or juices to take while rolling let me know!)<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;m being very safe about how I do molly and I think it&#039;s actually working.&nbsp; I seem to be able to roll frequently and not have negative effects.&nbsp; (My girlfriend on the other hand is having some negative effects, mostly mood swings.)<br /><br />So what do you guys think?&nbsp; Is weekly too much if it&#039;s done safely and in moderate doses?&nbsp; The last thing I want is to cause brain damage, ruin my memory, or develop Parkinsons later in life.

				Check out this website:&nbsp; http://thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html<br /><br />Long story short:&nbsp; you can roll frequently and be safe from permanent brain damage, as long as you eventually take a BIG break (as in, year +).<br /><br />After having tried MDMA recently, I became curious: just how good can it feel doing it with any frequency?

				&nbsp;I would limit myself to&nbsp; once or twice a year, on special occasions. I made the mistake of taking MDMA seven times within the space of two months. Now MDMA makes me feel sick, overstimulated, paranoid, etc. There is almost no euphoriant effect. I almost had a panic attack last time.

				the more often you do it, the weaker the effect becomes. i don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything physically unsafe in regular use, but since MDMA flushes your dopamine or seratonin or whatever (not a doctor), if you regularly roll you just have less good stuff in your brain to use up.<br /><br />or at least that&#039;s how i&#039;ve understood it.
