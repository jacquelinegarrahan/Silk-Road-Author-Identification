				Interesting. I was left with an odd amount of MDMA from a larger order. A friend and I ended up taking 20 mg each. I have heard the &quot;threshold&quot; dose for MDMA is 70 mg, so I was expecting no effect from this little experiment. Actually, both of us had enhanced openness and sociability. The whole thing had the typical arc of a roll, time of onset, length, etc., just very mild and pleasant. No comedown. Although the next day, my friend seemed to lack motivation. <br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d share.

				MDMA, like many drugs, act upon the system by causing the brain (or, rather, hormonal/chemical pumps powered by and empowering the brain) to release chemicals into the bloodstream in an unctrolled, far greater manner than would normally be released (if released at all). Any amount of a drug, if a sufficient reservoir exists, will still act upon its duties. Depending on the time since doing MDMA prior to this minor dosage, even a tiny dosage such as 20mg will still trigger a release of seratonin, no matter what, and it&#039;ll be a release that is far from normal, which will give you the feeling. This of course is dependent on the amount of MDMA that is actually found in a particular 20mg sample.

				Thanks for that, Mate. It makes sense to me. <br /><br />It had been two months for me, and I&#039;ll probably wait another two months before my next full roll. I&#039;m patient and don&#039;t want to cause problems.&nbsp; ;)

The obvious after effects are noticeable in the 1-3 day period. After the 4-6 day period, the substance is completely out of your system, and within 3-4 weeks, you&#039;re good to go again.<br /><br />If the source is pure, the risk of neuronal damage from MDMA is really, really fucking small unless you&#039;re rolling 2-3 times every week, with larger and larger doses. <br /><br />But obviously be safe and do it every couple of months, but doing it every few weeks isn&#039;t going to hurt you, just drink water, eat well, keep your body fit and healthy, and you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />I have done 20mg before and felt absolutely nothing. I think bodyweight definitely has a lot to do with it (200lb here), but there is a point between the 55mg and 65mg mark that I do indeed feel threshold effects - heightened mood, dilated pupils, increase heart rate, slightly heightened empathy levels and sociability. <br /><br />MDMA is a fucking wonderful drug. Truly wonderful, and actual gift to this world. And it&#039;s one of the very, very, VERY few drugs that could ever be classified as a positive drug, as in, it will overall do more good and will bring people closer together rather than do harm and ruin lives. The only people I&#039;ve seen &quot;fucked up&quot; from ecstasy, is just from shitty pills they buy at clubs, and they usually do meth or other contraindicative drugs.

				smogmonster13 how accurate is your scale?&nbsp; Is it one of those cheap 0.01g scales?<br /><br />My first dose of MDMA was &lt; 30mg and I felt nothing.&nbsp; The next time I used it I took maybe 60-80mg and I rolled my ass off (damn that was good MDMA) so I&#039;m really surprised you felt something at 20mg.&nbsp; These cheap scales such as measuring small amounts though.&nbsp; I have to tap them to get them to even pick up on small amounts.&nbsp; It is less of a problem as you put more weight on the scale though.

				It could be a dose mistake due to a non-accurate scale indeed. <br /><br />On the other hand, brain chemistry varies a bit between people and you may feel some effect from a really small dose like 20 mg mdma. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure the exact limit is clear though: sometimes people share a tablet of mdma that contains zomething like 140-160 mg for the whole tablet and certainly feel its effects. If there was such a mechanism that makes the first 60-70 completely ineffective that would not be expected. <br /><br />I suppose the best way to find out would be to take a known-good tablet and break it up into smaller pieces. By the time you break it down into quarters you could see if taking those has any effect at all.

				only time I felt an unpleasant comedown was when I took MDMA at low dose (about 100 mg) about 200 mg is always good

I have a very accurate milligram scale with a set of test weights to calibrate. I am certain about the dose. It was not, 21, or 19, but 20 milligrams. I weigh only 9 stone (138 pounds).
