				So I&#039;ve got some leftover MDMA from a while back, and just got some new stuff to add in the mix because I didn&#039;t have enough left over to make a good time for 2 people...<br /><br />I&#039;d like to just throw both kinds together and split it up after that, but I&#039;ve never had two different kinds before, and I want to make sure there isn&#039;t some huge risk involved in ingesting both.

				Ok, here&#039;s the thing: if it&#039;s pure MDMA, there will be absolutely no difference if you add them together.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t &quot;types&quot; of MDMA, so you are basically adding two of the same thing together and then taking it.<br /><br />If they aren&#039;t both MDMA, you are mixing drugs.&nbsp; Depending on what the drug is, it may or may not be safe.&nbsp; But generally, if your dosage is low and your dealer isn&#039;t a total asshat, it is safe to combine the two powders, as most drugs that are similar to MDMA do not react badly with each other.

				Yes, I meant two different &quot;kinds&quot; of MDMA just to say they are from different sources.&nbsp; Both are MDMA, but definitely cut with different things -- one has that beige/tan color while the other is barely off white, but they are clearly different.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, hearing that 4 different pills were okay, I&#039;m not too worried about it... those are definitely not pure, so there&#039;s probably not much risk other than taking the drug in the first place...<br /><br />Thx

				guess thats not the right thread, but I didn&#039;t find one so far....I&#039;m searching a thread abut MDMA in generall. cause I have questions about how to dose it and for example, what about &#039;mixing&#039; it with alcohol....how do you do it? nothing at all or just &#039;light&#039; alcohol, like beer or wine...?<br />and the dose...when you&#039;re just a little experienced or not at all....is 100mg a good idea? and how do you take it? <br />

				Having a different colour doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re &quot;cut&quot; with different things. More likely the chemists produced them in a different manner or idn&#039;t remove all the impurites/wash/clean from the final product.

It&#039;s generally a bad idea. Especially with MDMA. Consider what MDMA does to your body. It fucks with your body temperature and raises your heart rate and dehydrates you. Do you really want to throw alcohol into that mix, and become more dehydrated? You won&#039;t have a good feel for if you&#039;re thirsty or not. You pretty much just have to force yourself to drink a glass of water every hour or so.<br /><br />Also, alcohol inhibits MDMA and you won&#039;t get a proper roll off of it. <br /><br />If you&#039;ve never taken MDMA before start off with 100mg. There&#039;s a ratio to how much you should take based on how many pounds/kilograms you weigh. Try to find that. Overtime you may develop a tolerance, and that&#039;s normal. To avoid this tolerance try to only do MDMA once every 4-6 weeks. There&#039;s a good chance you won&#039;t lose the magic.<br /><br />Taking it: if you have crystal, measure out 100mg. Crush the crystals up fine, put it in a bit of toilet paper, and swallow it whole. Easiest way if it&#039;s your first time. You can plug it anally, but why don&#039;t you just stick to oral use for the first couple rolls? Don&#039;t insuffulate MDMA unless you enjoy a hardcore nasal drip and burn for your entire ride. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a good place for you to start reading if you&#039;re very interested in MDMA: http://wiki.bluelight.ru/index.php/MDMA:_Essential_Guide<br /><br />Make sure you take the preloading/postloading process very seriously. It will help you in the long run.

				ok, so when we, my friends and me, weigh like between 55 and 70 kg, 100mg is good to go? and then dipping another time (when?) or taking half of it(I read that) in another paper-bomb?

				You wanna&#039; roll hard your first time? Take 100mg to start, once you hit peak (usually about 3 hours after initially taking it), take another 100mg. Cut off at that point though. MDMA is most effective if you re-dose it at an appropriate time instead of taking a shit ton at the beginning.

				Stronger effects are almost always a good thing with MDMA. Just be careful. You don&#039;t want to be completely trashed the next day if you take too much.

				Yeah. You implied you want to roll your balls off. If it&#039;s your first time you&#039;ll be fine. Just every subsequent time in the future keep it lowkey and don&#039;t go overboard trying to go higher. <br /><br />I rarely re-dose anymore.
