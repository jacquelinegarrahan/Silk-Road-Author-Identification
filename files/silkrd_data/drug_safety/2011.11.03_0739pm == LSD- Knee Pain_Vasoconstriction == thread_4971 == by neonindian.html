				The past few times I have taken &#039;The Original Hoffmann&#039;, I have been experiencing a pain in my left knee.&nbsp; I believe it has something to do with the vasoconstriction because my left foot feels cold and then throughout the night I can feel blood rush back to it and warm it up.&nbsp; Also, this problem also happens I use 4-FA.&nbsp; 4-FA has been taken around the same time as the LSD, but not at the exact same time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried aspirin, but always at the same time I took the tabs.&nbsp; It&#039;s only on my left leg and its kind of hard to explain the feeling.&nbsp; It just always gets me worked up during the trip like something bad is going to happen to it but in the morning it&#039;s usually just fine.&nbsp; Anyone have any similar stories or suggestions? Thanks

				I might just try some other vasodilators like cayenne or niacin.&nbsp; My foot or knee do not turn blue/purple so I&#039;m thinking it isn&#039;t that bad of vasoconstircition but it gets to the point where I can&#039;t put pressure on my foot.&nbsp; So maybe a nerve problem?&nbsp;

				Yes, LSD possesses vasoconstrictive properties through actions at a serotonin receptor. This is the mechanism through which ergotamine and other ergoline based pharms are thought to produce their relief of migraines. <br /><br />The vasoconstriction caused by LSD should be relatively minor even at high dosages unless mixed with other drugs that also cause vasoconstriction. Drugs related to LSD can produce dangerous reactions however...<br /><br />For example, the macrolide antibiotics can potentially inhibit the cytochrome enzymes metabolizing ergotamine, which results in greater plasma concentrations. The increased vasoconstriction can lead to ischemia and damage to tissues, leading to the gangrene component of ergotism.
