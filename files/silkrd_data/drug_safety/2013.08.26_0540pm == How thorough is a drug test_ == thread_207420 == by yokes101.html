				mdma<br />amphetamins<br />thc<br />cocain<br />opiades<br /><br />are most common. if they test him for whatever substance depends on were he is going. &quot;the states&quot; doesn&#039;t make any sense. not sure there is a safe way to find out unless the institution doing the test is stupid.<br /><br />what kind of test will it be? if not a hair test, he has plenty of time to become clean. have him go easy on the weed, the rest flushes out pretty quickly.<br /><br />

				never heard that they make a blood test with everybody that moves over there... is that true? cant imgaine that. do you hve a reference?<br /><br />i can&#039;t answere your question. if its a blood test just have him stay clean for a week or so concerning chemical drugs and at least a month on weed.<br /><br />the less known the drugs is, the less likely it is, that they test for... if he absolutly has to take something. <br /><br />more likely is, that they will do a wipe test on his sh*t. mobile, wallet, electris shaving machine, etc. He shell keep all that stuff as clean of traces as he can.
