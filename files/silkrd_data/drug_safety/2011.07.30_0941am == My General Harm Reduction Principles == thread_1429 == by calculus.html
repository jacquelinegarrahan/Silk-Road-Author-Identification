				In my years of drug (ab)use I have learned a few things I would like to share. In no particular order:<br /><br />1) Avoid mixing different substances. This is a recipe for an OD.<br /><br />2) Don&#039;t do big doses all at once. Instead take small doses at steady intervals. This decreases the likelihood of an unpleasant experience or God forbid an OD.<br /><br />3) KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU&#039;RE PUTTING INTO YOUR BODY!!!! Most of the ugly experiences I&#039;ve seen/had with drugs has come not from the reputed substance itself, but rather from adulterants or substances being sold as something else. For example I had a friend OD on &quot;Molly&quot; which was actually discovered to be Mephedrone bath salts. I, myself, had an unpleasant experience with cocaine adulterated with levamisol. I still have all my limbs in tact but the blow to my immune system made me come down with a nasty cold and a lot of scabbing on my nostrils. So be smart; test your shit and be sure what you&#039;re taking is really what you think it is.<br /><br />4) Avoid needles. I have never used needles myself, and for a good reason. One, it&#039;s a recipe for an OD. Two, it fucks your veins up and can lead to nasty NASTY medical problems... i have friends who shot up H so much that their veins are hardened to the point where not even a trained nurse can get an IV in them. If you really want a rush, snort the shit.<br /><br />5) If you are going to use needles, at least do yourself the favor of using clean ones. Nobody wants to deal with AIDS, Hepatitis, HIV or a collapsed vein. Clean the site of your injection w/ rubbing alcohol, and also use a filter for whatever it is you&#039;re shooting up. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON&#039;T SHOOT UP PILLS!!!!! The pill binders will do some nasty shit to your veins, and that can potentially lead to your arm being sawed off or even death.<br /><br />5) Take care of your nose. if you&#039;re blowing rails of whatever powder it is, that shit WILL erode your nostrils. Just speaking from experience it is very unpleasant to deal with some raw ass nostrils that are constantly scabbing up on you. Make sure to wash out your nose after consumption, and don&#039;t be afraid to use neosporin.<br /><br />6) Don&#039;t forget to eat and drink water. This is especially true of amphetamines and MDMA. Trust me you will thank me later when you&#039;re crashing.<br /><br />Those are some rules I generally stick to. If I think of others I will share. Otherwise I hope someone finds this useful and also feel free to share your own advice.

				7) Constantly take high doses of ascorbate (vitamin C) and flavonoids (vitamin P), all day, every day.

				Many don&#039;t realize that when they shoot pills the particles have to go somewhere. Most of the time they end up in the lungs. So, you are right, DONT SHOOT PILLS. If you have to, put them through a wheel filter..

				My suggestion: While its more expensive, its a lot safer to substitute your drug of choice with the pharmaceutical equivalent. Not always an option, but I like knowing exactly what im about to put in my body. Although for stuff like weed, I don&#039;t see much of a risk. What ya see is usually what ya get. <br />
