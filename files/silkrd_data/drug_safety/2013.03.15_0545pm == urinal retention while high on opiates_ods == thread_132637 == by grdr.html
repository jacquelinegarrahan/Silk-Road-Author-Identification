				Putting your hands in lukewarm water helps somewhat.. (Putting you junk in lukewarm water also helps a little) But if it&#039;s really bad i doubt anything&#039;s gonna help. Coffee helps too if you take enough but it would kinda ruin an opiate high..

				Cranberry juice (like lots of it) sometimes helps me.&nbsp; But if I&#039;m super high, then that doesn&#039;t even really work.&nbsp; Just makes me have to pee that much worse (and still can&#039;t do it). Then I end up nodding out standing at the toilet and when I wake up, my legs are all sore from standing there lock kneed for 2 hours.&nbsp; And remember to stay hydrated as well, as you can easily forget to drink water whilst opiated. <br /><br />A hot shower can sometimes help as well.&nbsp; Oh, and definitely try sitting down (more comfortable when you&#039;re nodding the fuck out).&nbsp; Some people also find that pressing on the area between your ass and your balls (if you&#039;re a dude obviously), i.e. the &quot;taint&quot; can help loosen stuff up down there.&nbsp; That&#039;s never worked for me, but I know some people claim it does.&nbsp; But after 17 years of doing opiates, I have yet to find any surefire way to really beat that annoying side effect.&nbsp; I use it as a barometer of how fucked up I really am honestly.&nbsp; I just tell myself its my body trying to keep the drugs in as long as possible (you ain&#039;t going nowhere dope!).&nbsp; Happens to me bad on MDMA too, which is my other favorite chem. <br /><br />I&#039;ve learned to ignore it until I really really have to go, then thats when I actually try.&nbsp; If I try and go every time I kinda feel the need I&#039;ll end up spending 8 out of the 12 hours I&#039;m high standing at the fucking toilet nodding out.

				I&#039;ve tried just standing up in a warm shower, and letting the piss go wherever it goes.&nbsp; That&#039;s worked a few times.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do opiates anymore though - too much trouble for me, since I am allergic to all og them, except morphine (Damn!).

				you have to sit down and relax. Try to focus on every sensation. You have to visualize the piss coming out. I imagine that im at work in a factory and there are different valves and switches i have to turn and switch to open the floodgates. I close my eyes and think of all this happening and then the water comes pouring out lol. <br /><br />Also try to turn your sink on just low enough to have it trickling out. The noise of water flowing helps a lot. You could also turn on your shower.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or do some keigels exercises. They help to get the pee flowing. If you dont know what a keigel is google it. Good luck bro.&nbsp;

				Yep... as the above says. You have to sit down and try to relax every muscle in your lower body.<br /><br />As for the itching... try rubbing some Benedryl lotion for where you feel the itch.
