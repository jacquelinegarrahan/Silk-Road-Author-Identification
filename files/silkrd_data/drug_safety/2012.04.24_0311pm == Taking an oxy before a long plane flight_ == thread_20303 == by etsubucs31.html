				Hey guys, in a couple of weeks I&#039;m going to be flying to Europe. I hate long flights and find it impossible to fall asleep. I figured taking an Oxycontin before the flight would make it much more enjoyable. Anybody have experience with this or think it would be a good idea? Also, I&#039;ve never taken one before, what would be a good dosage? Thanks for any advise!

				I wouldn&#039;t take Oxycontin if you have never taken it before just for the flight.<br />They act rather fast and strong, imo a benzo (Xanax for example) would be preferable.<br />Maybe take 0.5mg on the ground and keep some on the plane with you to take if the <br />dosage was too low or your start feeling anxious.<br />Best try whatever you want to take a few days before.

				Thanks for the reply. However I am a little cautious taking a Xanax. The one and only time I took one, I didn&#039;t really feel much, but then went to sleep around midnight and slept until 6pm the next day and couldn&#039;t remember much from the previous night.

				If you say &quot;A Xanax&quot;, maybe it was a 2mg bar?<br />Anyway, better wait for the more competent members :)

				I&#039;m not really sure the dosage, my friend just called it a totem pole, which I am pretty sure is Xanax.

				Do it! But I&#039;m sure you&#039;d enjoy it more on benzos, especially Klonopin/Clonazepam, it&#039;s the longest acting, meaning you&#039;ll be enjoying it the entire flight, not just the first 2-4 hrs.

				totem pole is generally a 2mg xanax, which is a pretty heavy dose for a first time user. Stick to 0.5mg on the ground and another 0.5mg on the flight if you feel you need to

				Also, if I wanted to take one on the flight home as well, am I ok with just putting it in my checked bag?

				Personally, I like to do a thumbprint just before takeoff so that I start coming up as the plane lifts off. Then when I finally peak I try to smoke about 150-200 mg of 5-meo-DMT. Helps me relax.

Luckily I didn&#039;t have any laughing fits but I did have like a 10 minute ear to ear smile plastered on my face, I had to put my head down to hide it but the lack of light caused a whole bunch of intense visuals. It was a pretty good experience but one that I would not repeat again because things could have gone very very wrong.

				Get a totem.<br /><br />Break it into .5 pieces.<br /><br />Take one .5 right before the flight.<br /><br />Take another .5 after the other fully wears off. (it will)<br /><br />If you plan on crashing asap after touchdown, get to your room, pop the other .5s and hit the sack.<br /><br />If not, then use as needed.<br /><br />Problem solved for like 5$ from RxKing.
