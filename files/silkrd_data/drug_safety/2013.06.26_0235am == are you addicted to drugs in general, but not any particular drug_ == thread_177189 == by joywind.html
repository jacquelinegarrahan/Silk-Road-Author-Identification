Be it scripts, or diets, gambling, sex, masturbation, smoking, weed, or even just over-zealous routines, work outs, running... etc. we are addicted to chemical reactions and communication pathways in our brains.<br /><br />Moderation is the key.

				Its because we are hardwired to seek out pleasurable experience, and through classical conditioning we learn to repeat the experience that caused the rewarding response. Just like pavlovs dogs where trained to salivate at the sound of a bell because it signals that food is coming. We are very instinctual creatures.

				same here. I just need something. When I was younger this urge would sometimes drive me to do crazy shit like huff butane... (dont try that) Now i got it under control. I&nbsp; think.<br />The only thing I ever got&nbsp; really&nbsp; addicted to was smoking and drinking. <br />Thank god I quit those.<br />I don&#039;t use legal drugs. Not even coffee.

				A proper term used by many would be a &quot;polysubstance&quot; user or addict.<br /><br />Someone who likes anything to get fucked up on and mixes them.<br /><br />I love bud, coke, opiates, shrooms+lsd, mdma, and benzos so I am a polysubstance user as I often also mix drugs.

				Yes, i am definitely a poly-substance abuser. i prefer opiates, benzos, alcohol, marijuana, barbiturates, and &#039;downers&#039; in general. off and on, i am physically addicted to various substances -- i can&#039;t count the number of times i&#039;ve been through withdrawal from alcohol, benzos or opiates... right now i&#039;m dependant on opiates, and possibly benzos as well (i&#039;m not sure on the benzos atm.) i just need to slow my mind down, drive out the panicky anxiety and depression, and calm myself down/provide some comfort... any way i can. since drugs are the most pleasurable coping mechanism for me, that&#039;s the route i choose. plus, with the opiates and MJ, i live with chronic pain that can be severe, so that both necessitates opiate/medical MJ use and exacerbates the depression i self-medicate for.<br /><br />as for whether it&#039;s &#039;bad,&#039; well, i think that is subjective. if you&#039;re unable to cope with daily life without some sort of crutch, i wouldn&#039;t call that healthy. more than likely there are some psychological stressors you&#039;re avoiding with your drug use. but some people use drugs as a crutch. some people use religion. some use alcohol. some use computer games like World of Warcraft as an escapist technique. any of those methods can be used moderately, or it can be overdone and ruin lives. <br /><br />some people can handle everyday drug use and function, some cannot. if you&#039;re going to use something every day, just try to understand why, and try to keep grounded. take a day off now and then to reconnect with your non-drug self, and maybe examine the root of the need to be high all the time. try to take breaks to avoid becoming physically dependent on anything, and to avoid avoiding your own consciousness completely. don&#039;t lose sight of who you really are or why you&#039;re doing whatever it is you&#039;re doing.

				To a degree yes, I really enjoy mind altering substances, but I tend to stay on the &#039;light and natural&#039; side such as alcohol and cannabis. I do try herbals such as kava and such from time to time; imho those work better as companions to something else though. I am interested in trying shrooms. Mostly I like to stay with non-synthetic / non-manmade things. I had some bad experiences with RC&#039;s a few years back. I like kratom to a degree as well. I like to have a few things I can &#039;rotate&#039; through rather than do the same thing every day.<br /><br />But I have kind of an addictive personality. I know I would probably love cocaine, but I&#039;m afraid to get into anything much &#039;harder&#039; for fear of getting too drawn into it. I know I would love opiates, I tried some CWE on some T#3&#039;s before, very nice. With substances I can seem to manage to keep my regular life together. The funny thing is I love video games too. But I have completely sworn off video games. Those will keep me up until 4AM when I need to get up for work at 6AM. Video games for me is actually worse than substances.

				Story of my life. I started with weed and tobacco but when i would run out, this feeling would slowly creep in, A boredom of sorts but so powerful it would literally make me physically uncomfortable, like sitting on&nbsp; plane for ten hours, no matter what. Well unless i got high. As a previous used said, when i was younger it would drive me to do almost anything. I snorted pills i found washed up from a river thinking they were Norco&#039;s ( They wernt, Best guess is they were Anti-seizure pills :-[ ). I have plenty of similar stories with drugs you cant really abuse, or ones that are stupid legal highs. All embarrassing and stupid ideas. I have control of myself now, being able to go sober when necessary, but that feeling is still entirely there, if not stronger. Drugs are still the only thing to relive this, and trust me ive tried plenty of other ideas to help keep my mind off it. But it dosent really worry me, i don&#039;t spend all my money or use when its a bad time, and as far as i can tell i am in control of it all.

				I&#039;m not really sure how to answer it.<br /><br />First of all i am a regular smoker, so just due to that i am &#039;on something&#039; whenever i&#039;m awake.<br /><br />Besides that i use benzo&#039;s and like a good drink, which sort of ends up in benzo&#039;s during the day and drinks at night (i am aware of the dangers of this combination). <br /><br />For me some other drug, for example cannabis, does not replace any of the above. At times i enjoy smoking a joint with friends, but that would be a less than weekly thing, and not something i ever crave when i haven&#039;t smoked pot for a while. Things like mdma or opiates i use very rarely, and i don&#039;t think there is much substitution going on there. At one time i did notice that an injection of 20 mg morphine made my craving for a smoke go away after surgery, but that is just a single event, and not a habit it&#039;d like to exchange for another at all.

				I&#039;ve felt this way at points in my life.&nbsp; Mainly being constantly stoned on weed.&nbsp; Recently though I&#039;ve learned to enjoy the sober periods as well though.&nbsp; It makes me appreciate being fucked up even more when it is only on occasion.

				I agree that Americans are just addicts to STUFF in general...could be new clothes, could be a needle in your arm....<br /><br />I pretty much need to get high every day, I&#039;m not ashamed to say it. My mind is so overactive. And yeah, if I can&#039;t have my DOC, I substitute. I was completely sober for about seven months last year and it was nice...but rather boring and ridiculously restrictive. Got tired of it.<br /><br />I really like excess but....I know moderation is best.<br /><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;m aiming for.

				I easily smoke 4-5 grams of weed per diem, myself. That doesn&#039;t include dabs, and edibles.<br /><br />I do Oxys like 2-4 days straight, once a month.&nbsp; I do coke, only really when I&#039;m getting aches after an Oxy binge. <br />I eat shrooms, acid, and smoke DMT. Acid for concerts, Shrooms for at home... DMT... well, it doesn&#039;t really matter, as long as I have somewhere to chill. :P<br /><br />Benzos... meh... if I&#039;m desperate for sleep. Adderall? NEVER. I used to itch for it when I was a teen. Such a shitty lifestyle/addiction. <br /><br />And my mind is pretty open to everything else. <br /><br />Before the age of 14: I&#039;ve shot morphine(Holy fuck), snorted heroin(damn.), snorted cocaine(eh...), snorted Oxy40s, snorted adderall+speed, freebased coke(foil-crack, it wasnt terrible), freebased meth(fucking gross), and smoked wet, and mad weed.<br /><br />After the age of 19: Freebased N,N, DMT(yay!) freebased 5-meo-DMT(holy FUCK) snorted, eaten: 2C-i(decent, not my thing tho), 2C-b(meh), 25i-NBOMe(ew), LSA(ew), LSD(yay!), Shrooms(yay!), Hash-oil Elixir(Nooooooo I&#039;m mellltttinnnggg forrreever), and mad dabs and weed. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been smoking herb for 20 years. :P

				Shrooms are the only drug I do, though I am looking forward to trying LSD. Shrooms just don&#039;t seem to lend themselves to taking everyday due to the speed with which tolerance sets in. Fortunately the tolerance wears off in a week for me.
