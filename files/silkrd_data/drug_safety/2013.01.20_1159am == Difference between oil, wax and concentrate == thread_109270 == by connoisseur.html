				BHO = Butane Hash Oil<br />BHO is a type of hash oil that is made via butane extraction.<br /><br />Hash oils are concentrates that are made via different methods. There is BHO, QWISO, CO2 extracted and probably some lesser-known oils.<br /><br />Concentrates are pretty much all the products that are not weed. Even regular hash is a type of concentrate.<br /><br />All of these can be used to treat cancer.

				@Ballzinator that&#039;s a good explanation.&nbsp; I am more of a plant-material smoker and haven&#039;t tried any concentrates really except for hash a couple of times.&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested to try some potent hash oil sometime, but I usually just end up saying fuck it and buying plain old weed instead.&nbsp; I guess if any oil were to fall into my hands I wouldn&#039;t complain. <br /><br />Are concentrates that much better than regular weed?

Your average bud is gonna be about 8-25% THC content, while oils can be up to 70 or 80% thc!!! I have made the switch from primarily smoking weed to primarily smoking hash oil out of my oil rig, and not only does it save me money (you only need a tiny little dab of oil to get high as fuck) but it feels easier on my lungs (no plant matter like when smoking weed). <br /><br />If you do not have a rig and have some oil to smoke, you can put it on a joint or smoke it out of a bowl with weed, but in my opinion that is wasting it as you will not get nearly as high.

Smoking oil is pretty much just another vaping method.
