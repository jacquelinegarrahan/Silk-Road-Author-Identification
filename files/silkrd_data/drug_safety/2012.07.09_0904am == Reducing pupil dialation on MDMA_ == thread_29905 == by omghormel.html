				My pupils are massive when I take MDMA, much bigger than my friends who take the same ammount.. My eyes are wide open when I roll too, something I try not to do but can&#039;t help.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t go very well with my light skin and makes my face look&nbsp; cartoonish. Are there any home-remides of reducing pupil dilation while rolling that SR is aware of? Any help would be much appriciated!

				Unfortunately, there really isn&#039;t much you can do to shrink your pupils while you are ON MDMA, unless you want to wear color contacts. MDMA acts on your serotonin level and stimulates the 5-HTA serotonergic receptors which induces pupil dilation or mydriasis. Since the increase of serotonin is what is repsonsible for your MDMA high, you really can&#039;t reduce the pupil dilation without blocking serotonin production, thus destroying your high.&nbsp; Which is not recommendable&nbsp; :) The next day, you may have some less pronounced pupil dilation as well. If you have work or a family function, IMO I would say either I didn&#039;t get a good sleep (which can induce pupil dilation) or you had to go to the optometrist yesterday and he dilated your pupils. Hope this helps a little. <br /><br />djan

				Taking an opiate can help reduce pupil dilation. As far as how much, I do not know. It will depend on the amount you take (of both MDMA and the opiate), as well as when you are taking the drugs - how far apart.<br /><br />In regards to &quot;home remedies&quot;, there is not really anything you can do. It&#039;s not like having bloodshot eyes. <br /><br />sdesu

				There are eye drops made of pilocaprine nitrate which constricts your pupils, but it&#039;s prescription only as far as I know. It&#039;s used for treating glaucoma.

				Thanks for all your replies guys,<br /><br />I wear contacts everyday so I might go and grab some coloured ones and see how they go! Do I need any pair in particular?<br /><br />Cheers,
