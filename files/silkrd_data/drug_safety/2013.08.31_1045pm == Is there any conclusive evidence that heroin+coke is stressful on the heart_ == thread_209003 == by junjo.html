				I seem to see mixed info from this depending on the source.<br />Some places say that the combination is indeed more cariotoxic than taking a stimulant on its own.<br />Others say that the real danger is accidentally ODing on heroin after the coke wears off.<br />I assume that the latter is entirely correct, but I&#039;m skeptical on the &quot;mixing an upper and downer messes with your heart because they&#039;re opposites&quot; theory. <br />Any sort of citation is appreciated.<br />Thanks!<br />

				I would really like to see a study by an official lab/group of scientists that involves them injecting two of the most illegal and well known substances on the planet into a patient and running tests ;D<br /><br />I highly doubt any legitimate labs would be able to provide a good explanation to the government on why they would be testing/using both these substances at the same time haha

				This scares me because I&#039;ve been encouraged to take Benzo&#039;s on comedowns for NBOMES. IDK If they are officially stimulants or what, considering they are RCs, but the trip definitely felt speedy. I felt tweaked out. I did take a xanax on the comedown and didn&#039;t really think much of it. This was like a week ago.<br /><br />Is it even safe to take a benzo while trying to come down off this stuff? I was thinking about that heart issue involving stimulants/ downers, the whole night and it was getting to me. I seemed to have forgot about it but this post reminded me. I remember seeing stuff way back when in school, telling me not to mix stimulants and downers because of the stress it puts on your heart, and I haven&#039;t done so until the other week.

				Conclusive evidence?<br /><br />Look at the countless deaths of people who do speedballs. ( Heroin + coke mix )<br /><br />It&#039;s completely retarded of someone to mix any stimulant with a severe downer.<br /><br />Granted, during a COMEDOWN, taking a benzo does help you relax and fall asleep, but usually, the drug has ran its course so your heart isnt going 1,000,000 mph,<br />so thus it seems alot safer to take a benzo AFTER about maybe an hour or so of coming down.<br /><br />But, i&#039;m not a dr. and can only speak from experience.<br /><br />MIXING DRUGS IS DUMB, AND BLATANTLY UNSAFE.<br /><br />If your gonna do a stimulant like coke or meth, suck it up!, You bought the ticket, you take the ride. Comeups and Comedowns.
