				hey guys, unfortunately dolfan&#039;s dope isn&#039;t doing it for me anymore. Just tooted a tenth and it&#039;s meh, great service and nice guy though.<br /><br />Just curious who you consider&nbsp; to have the most potent dope?<br /><br />I understand there&#039;s a Thread for this in rumor mill, but i can&#039;t go and compare everyone&#039;s review on each seller.<br /><br />Thanks!

				just read the past few pages of the H thread and youll have a pretty good idea. I think reading the personal reports its the best way since so many people have difference preferences. you asked for personal experience, but I can only give you a summary of the general consensus. <br /><br />For powder to snort or poke, right now you cant beat the no 4 from wumg and tony which are reportedly equivalent. some report its the best H overall currently<br /><br />For smoking or snorting according to psilocin himself, his base is reportedly top notch<br /><br />For tar, i dont pay much attention, but i think JD or pharmerJ<br /><br />Personally, I have only tried theMunchies wayyy back, and it was such a let down I have avoided H on the road since. Bags with only less than .025 of disappointment in em... I regret missing my opportunity to sample nucleos gear though and since some have said the current 4 compares, I will be reviewing wumg soon hopefully. He has been a really nice guy with awesome communication so far.<br /><br />- miR

But the info you gave me has settled already.

				I can personally attest to the quality of Wumg00&#039;s gear by snorting (my preferred ROA). I&#039;m new to heroin (but not opiates) and I railed about an 1/8 bag last night and it put me in a real good place.

				from what I hear from everyone in the H thread that has gotten psilocin&#039;s gear, it is the best for smoking and sniffing. the best. I ordered some last weekend so it should be arriving really soon. I can&#039;t fucking wait. <br /><br />what is your preferred method? for IV, go with tony&#039;s or wungs #4- it pricey but quality. for sniffing/smoking, go with psilocin&#039;s #3- you can&#039;t beat his price for that quality. for strait smoking, go with tar, I hear pharmer&#039;s is top notch. <br /><br />hope this helps&nbsp; 8) 8)

				I chose wumg over tony because of the shipping method differences. One sad the bag was obvious, and others claimed they couldnt even find the bag and thought it was accidentally left out.<br /><br />Personally, I too was briefly stumped by wumgs packaging, and would say it is the most ingenious disguise I have seen. I am testing the quality now and will leave a review on the main thead, but can already tell it is fire and was the correct weight. Already making themunchies look like a scammer which is what I was hoping for! Twice as potent, twice as heavy, and yet half the price. That is 800 percent better!
