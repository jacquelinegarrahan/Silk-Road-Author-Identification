				Preload w/ 5HTP all week leading up to roll (50-100mg per day) ; stop taking 5htp the day before you roll<br /><br />Vitamin-C&nbsp; Before, after and especially DURING your roll. Eat an orange while rolling. Vitamin C oxidises your brain and prevents neurotoxicity and helps keep you from getting that &quot;cracked out&quot; feeling. During the roll it will give you a burst.<br /><br />Should also add to this thread what to NOT take or what to STOP taking before / during roll;<br />&#039;<br />I have rolled harder and more times then most people as I used to sell them. Do not take roxies or any other strong opiates before or during your roll. Extremely dangerous; it takes a lot to get me to a place where I can honestly say I was scared for my life, because I am usually the one helping people out of a crisis, but I had been taking roxies and mixing those two is asking for it. <br /><br />

				5htp, multivitamins, grapefruit juice, magnesium(pre), and vitamin water.&nbsp; SOME people I know use a single dose of SSRI as a post-load to lessen the hangover, but I never seem too affected by the next-day hangover from mdma.

				SSRI&#039;s are things like Paxil and Celexa. Antidepressants. Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors. I believe MDMA causes a high of serotonin and anti-depressants adhere to to the synapses and cause serotonin levels in the brain to become abnormally. Coming off MDMA would seem like it would cause a depressed feeling and it would possibly prevent that by causing excess serotonin in the synapse.

				Rasgelline or Segeline. There is nothing that works better for pre-loading than MAO-Bs. Almost completely takes away suicide tuesdays, (although you are still going to be hungover).

				I find the day after rolling balls the best thing in the world is an EXTRA LARGE Tim Horton&#039;s coffee.&nbsp; Be careful with 5HTP folks, it is actually fairly potent stuff and it can strongly effect people in different ways.&nbsp; 100mg every few hours is okay.&nbsp; I have never noticed it do anything for me, either as a mood stabilizer or pre/post MDMA tweak.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t really get &#039;hangovers&#039; from MDMA, but my sleeping is sure fucked up good and proper for the next week after dropping 400mg in a night (yes, I know).&nbsp; I fall into these bizarre lucid dreams, it is quite disconcerting.&nbsp; Seratonin is a funny thing that does all sorts of stuff in the brain.&nbsp;

				Most important thing, is just not to use MDMA too often. Methylone doesn&#039;t deplete your Serotonin as quickly, but I still prefer to try not use it often, wait longer for magical times.&nbsp; :D

My understanding is that oxidation is the CAUSE of nerotoxicity, and Vitamin C, being an Anti-Oxidant, prevents this. Same with Vitamin E and Grape Seed Extract. In theory any anti-oxidant should help with the neurotoxicity side of things.

				There is a little misinformation here on 5-HTP. 5-HTP should not be consumed prior to a roll. Supplementing should be stopped 48 hours in advanced. 5-HTP could be taken post roll but the benefits are speculative. The Most important aspect of preloading is getting your anti-oxidants up. Do load up pre-roll, it is even smart to take a supplement during the roll. Nerutoxicity is the result of the massive oxidants introduced by one of MDMA metabolites. The oxidants tend to overwhelm the body&#039;s natural supply of anti-oxidants.

				I eat barely anything the day I&#039;m going to roll. <br /><br />I abuse the shit out of nitrous while rolling. And maybe some GHB. Seriously, people: MDMA/NO2/GHB is the greatest combo of life. It&#039;s all angels and blowjobs.<br /><br />Once I&#039;m done with the roll, like when I&#039;m completely out of seratonin &amp; the sun is coming up, I do a hit of GHB so I still feel a little high, take some vitamin B (to reup after the nitrous), and start an intensive 5htp regimen that lasts a few days.<br /><br />If I don&#039;t have GHB I take xanax.<br /><br />

It&#039;s beneficial properties are also not confirmed. 5-HTP is best used to help restore levels after a roll.

				the last time i rolled i took this everyday for the 3 days BEFORE i rolled:<br /><br />5HTP - 50mg<br />Vitamin C - 500mg<br />Thiamin (Vitamin B1) - 12mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) - 15 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Niacin (Vitamin B3) - 45 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vitamin B6 - 8 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Vitamin B12 - 9 Ug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) - 22 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Biotin - 130 Ug<br />Folacin (folic acid) - 370 Ug<br />Magnesium - 95 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Zinc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 10 mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />On the day where i took the MDMA i didn&#039;t take any 5HTP, but doubled the dose of Vitamin C and tripled the dose of Magnesium and Zinc. <br />Then for 3 days after the roll, i went back to consuming what i took the 3 days before i rolled. <br />I also didn&#039;t eat anything for around 6+ hours before i took the MDMA. <br />I didn&#039;t experience a comedown as such but i have only taken MDMA about 5 times in my life. They have been spaced out at least 2months apart. The experience was very good one as well, but when is it not with MDMA?!&nbsp; ;)
