				So I while back I got some oxymorphone and did it and felt great (about 20 or 30mg if i remember correctly), but I remember reading somewhere that if you use oxymorphone youll never get as high on hydro or oxycodone again. Sure enough I downed 100mg of hydro and didn&#039;t feel as good as you&#039;d expect to taking that much. I use opiates very infrequently (like maybe once a month) so its not like daily use is building a tolerance......has anyone else noticed this?<br /><br />I like oxymorphone but the damn new forumlation is a bitch so I wanted something with good oral bio-availability, meh&nbsp; ::)

				You do opiates once a month, and you took 100mg of hydro in a single dose? Jesus christ thats a lot. Oxymorphone is defintiely the strongest pharmaceutical opioid. But I don&#039;t really like it that much, and have never experienced any sort of perma-tolerance like that, I duno why it would be specific to Opana anyway. Codone &gt; Morphone.

				Permanent tolerance is real. I have it from being a heroin addict there isn&#039;t much you can do about it and it will never go away. It is like your brain has been scarred from abuse and won&#039;t ever heal to how it was before. Anyone who says it doesn&#039;t exist hasn&#039;t been a long term abuser of opiates and then abstained for a long period of time like a year and tried to eat a pill or any type of opiate, because if you have tried this you will know that to your amazement and disbelief that you do still in fact have a tolerance.<br /><br />I just refuse to do any kind of opiate, because not only does it take a fair amount, but anytime I do it I get mild withdrawls the next day no matter what. Opiates are a drug that I have ruined from years of heroin abuse. It sucks, because I do wish I could sit back and do a few Norco&#039;s and feel good buzz every now and then, but it is like my body has revoked that privilege.

				You should never get permanent opiate tolerance by following some simple steps from the word go, such as spacing out doses, not redosing, potentiating, and taking an anti-addictive (namely DXM) prior to every dose.

				I have very low opiate tolerance, even after daily use for over 2 years (heavy hydro/oxy use) sniffing over 15mg of oxy at a rip would made me sick. I did build a slight tolerance, but nothing compared to my partners in crime. Sort of a good thing I guess. Benzos and similar drugs on the other hand I&#039;ve always had an extremely high tolerance for, and perhaps a permanently higher one from my does of being prescibed 2 mg xanax 4X daily for a few years. It&#039;s been a about 4 years since I&#039;ve taken any benzos and I took over 100mg over the course of the night recently with no real memory loss (little hazy at points) or any other things you would expect from that dose after 4 years of nothing. Felt fucking great though.<br /><br />I suppose it differs person to person, but there are permanent effects, it messes with your brain chemisty man. chasing the dragon and all that. just be care full of OD after a period of no use, I&#039;ve heard too many bad stories.

				As far as I know there are 2 types of a tolerance regarding opiate use. A short-term one and a long-term tolerance. Short-term tolerance is the one all users know. You take opiates regularly for some time and your brain gets used to it - you need more. But when you take opiates for a long time (months, years), your dopamine receptors get really worn out. And it takes a looong time for them to recover. That is when long-term tolerance applies and it will never feel the&nbsp; same as the first few times. It can take months, years or even decades for them to recover. The side-effect of this happening is PAWS (post-accute withdrawal syndrome) when people feel depressed, anxious etc. for years after they stopped.

Something lik 100 mg oxazepam may put you out for the night, but is in itself not that dangerous.<br /><br />Xanax is roughly 10 times more potent compared to diazepam, and taking a 100 mg dose would certialy be dangerous Taking legix xanax this would require you to take 50 tablets though, and i somehow doubt you would be able to get them out of the blisters after finishing the first strip ;).

				A break is a must if you are going to use opiates regularly. This is how I have been maintaining myself for the past 2-3 years. However, I never got completely out of the vicious opiate regime. I have been regularly taking breaks about a month long every now and then. Also I switch between various opiates, from tramadol to heroin.

				If you can really take a full month off thats pretty damn good. My tolerance pretty much resets after a full month off. Switching up diff opiates is also better than having a specific DOC, sometimes for me it will just be Kratom at work for a week or two. But yeah, completely breaking free is pretty difficult, I guess removing yourself from a geographic location and/or permanently excommunicating with certain contacts is what it takes.

My tolerance pretty much resets after a full month off. Switching up diff opiates is also better than having a specific DOC, sometimes for me it will just be Kratom at work for a week or two. But yeah, completely breaking free is pretty difficult, I guess removing yourself from a geographic location and/or permanently excommunicating with certain contacts is what it takes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well moving away can make it easier, but I think that if you still have the desire to use, you will find a way how to get it :) By the way, we have the SR which gives us the ability to get what we want, no matter where we are located :) Long live Silk Road :P
