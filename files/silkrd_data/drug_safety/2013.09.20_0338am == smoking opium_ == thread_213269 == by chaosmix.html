				Don&#039;t heat it directly, you can vape it, you can use charcoal like they do with hookahs, you can stick a glob on a hot knife or pin and capture smoke under shotglass and suck it up. Just no direct flame, foil would probably not work too well imo, but if it&#039;s totally cleaned and refined latex than perhaps. <br /><br />Have fun!

				You could do all that, but the old fashioned way to smoke opium does use a pipe, heating the opium over the flame of an oil lamp. While we have no opium dens as such anymore, i suppose using something like a lighter and a crack pipe would actually be an easy replacement.<br /><br />Using opium this way goes back a long time, and predates all problems with people injecting the stuff and suffering the severe consequences of that. As I recall from the notes of an explorer about Laos: &quot;it is easier to smoke an opium pipe here than it is to obtain a glass of beer&quot;. <br /><br />By now this is no longer the case however, as Laos has banned opiates but also brews the excellent beer Lao, famous throughout indochina.

You know what tho, a crack pipe is a great idea, try getting a small ball of latex on a pin, heat the charboy/brillo up red hot inside the crack pipe, then dab that latex on the hot charboy i bet it would goo up nicely down the char, especially if you pack a bit more in than you would with crack, then you can just heat the outside of the stem to smoke the rest of the latex stuck in the brillo, avoiding direct contant with the latext and avoiding the waste that comes with direct flame. woop

				Honestly I think you would get better results just by eating it or make it in to a tea.
