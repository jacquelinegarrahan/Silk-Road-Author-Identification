				I&#039;d say no because that&#039;s asking for a bad trip to happen. I understand your want/need for processing the grief. believe me, I did the same thing but I had some experience with L/shrooms before I started working on my interpersonal issues. <br /><br />Go through the grieving process of those deaths first, (completely) then have that experience that you&#039;re looking for. You&#039;ll never find acceptance until you understand the process itself. I had about 10 years of processing before finally understanding it then accepting it via psychedelic experiences. This will take time/emotional investment for yourself. Don&#039;t make it worse on yourself by doing psychedelic drugs.&nbsp;

				Shrooms for me at least has been always very dark and heavy. It forces you to think about things that you don&#039;t want to think about. do you really want that to happen? I don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll help you or not but relying on benzos to make the trip better or stop it completely won&#039;t help because you&#039;ll be thinking about &quot;okay, I have this as a backup if things go bad&quot; what if things do go bad and you take your benzo, it doesn&#039;t work? what will happen? <br /><br />I&#039;d go with L than shrooms if you want introspective therapy.&nbsp;

				I lost a family member last year, and a few months later took some acid and some shrooms like a week after that. tbh I think I&#039;m just a glutton for punishment, as neither of those trips were fun or recreational in any way! They were very intense, more like work to get through. It felt kind like, if I was back in school and I&#039;d waited the entire semester to do ALL of my homework, and today was the day to do it ALL. Because of all the work it took to keep pulling myself out of these sad loops, I guess the experiences were somewhat purgative and clarifying, but imo fwiw grief is better dealt with in a sober state of mind. <br /><br />I would caution against using any psychedelics until you&#039;ve processed the grief as well as you can, unless you&#039;re prepared to battle through what will likely be a tough trip.

				listen to your gut. only take psychedelics when you&#039;re in a good set and setting... this is crucial! personally, i never would have come to terms with my mother&#039;s death if it weren&#039;t for psychedelics. i took mescaline a month or so after she died, went into her room and started peaking. i was so overwhelmed by her energy that i just rolled around on her bed in the dark crying for a while, until the tibetan book of living and dying fell on my head! i opened it up and she had folded over pages on preparing for death. needless to say, that trip put things into perspective for me and helped a lot with the grieving process.
