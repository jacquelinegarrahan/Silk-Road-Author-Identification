				Just wanted to check I&#039;m doing this right.<br /><br />I normally weigh out 150mg&#039;s of H and add 5-10mgs of citric.<br /><br />All seems fine until I add heat, at boiling point some sort of reaction occurs. I end up with a golden liquid and a load of dark coloured precipitate. I normallly filter this off when I draw up the suringe.<br /><br />Am I doing this right?

				Just can&#039;t seem to find any guides out there for #3. I&#039;ve only dealt with china white before, which just dissolves with no prep at all.<br />Not massively experienced with #3 brown powder grade.

				There are two main types of diamorphine consumed by heroin users: diamorphine base (brown heroin) and diamorphine hydrochloride (white heroin). White heroin, produced mainly in the Golden Triangle (Burma, Laos and Thailand), is the traditional heroin consumed in North America. It is the most refined heroin you can get and is often referred to as No. 4 heroin. Brown heroin, produced mainly in the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran), is most common in the UK and Europe. It is less refined and is often referred to as No. 3 heroin. <br />Confusingly, No. 1 and No. 2 heroin are not really drugs at all; rather they refer to the materials and stages used to make street heroin.<br /><br />How much citric or ascorbic acid is required to dissolve pure base heroin?&nbsp; (for every 369.4g of diamorphine base, you need 64.03g of citric acid or 176.1g of ascorbic acid&nbsp; or&nbsp; a 5 to 1 RATIO ). Example: As you mentioned, 150mgs of&nbsp; #3 require anywhere from 15 to 30 mgs of Citric Acid.&nbsp; 150/30= 5. <br /><br />Boiling? <br />Heroin, be it #3 or # 4 Should NOT be Boiled. It should be Heated till you see some steam. Tar is usually heated Twice, once to melt it, twice to separate it.<br /><br />oppyate<br />

				Thanks for the info oppyate.<br /><br />Seems like I did everything right, might have heated a bit much, but only got a mild buzz off it, (it was AA&#039;s brown #3 btw). My opiate tolerance must be higher than I thought!

Best thing to do is prep it as though you were going to shoot it, but instead drip 4 or 5 drips into your Nose.<br />Very nice high as opposed to smoking #4. If your dead set on smoking, get yourself some #3 and smoke it raw.<br /><br />oppy
