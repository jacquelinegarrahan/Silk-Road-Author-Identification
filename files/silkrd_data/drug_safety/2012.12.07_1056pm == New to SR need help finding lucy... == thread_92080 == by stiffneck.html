				Howdy,<br /><br />Folks I know this might be a stupid question but I just need an answer.&nbsp; I had a time just finding the site.&nbsp; I can understand the reason behind this.&nbsp; I have a TOR running and want to buy some bitcoins for a purchase.&nbsp; The one and only reason I came on the site was to find some clean good cid.&nbsp; The last I had was in Washington called US BLUES.&nbsp; I really likes those.&nbsp; <br /><br />My problem is when I am on the front? page of SL it only has a handful of items for purchase.&nbsp; And LSD is not one of them.&nbsp; But I come to the fourms and there are all kinds of posts about Lucy and who has what and how great it is and whatnot.&nbsp; I have been searching for so long.&nbsp; I have been waiting for her to find me not for me to find her.&nbsp; But I figure She helps those who help themselves.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to purchase anywhere from 25 doses up to a sheet.&nbsp; I suffer from chronic back pain and have found that Lucy changes my perception of pain.&nbsp; I have to take Opiate pain meds and would really like to start to lower my dose.&nbsp; I just know that Lucy can help me.&nbsp; I have some mushies started but would like a supply of good ol clean cid to get my mind straight.&nbsp; I know I am a new member and people might be wary of a newb but I have been on a few other sites for years dealing with these type of substances...<br /><br />Anyone care to help out a newb who plans on being around here for a great while?<br /><br />Much Love<br />stiffneck

				Thank you Flow for the response.... My question is how do I get to the main page of silkroad?&nbsp; the url I tired http://tfaqeav4iwpe3566.onion/ sent me to a page with just a handful of items for purchase. Like cannabis, cocaine, script drugs... but no Lucy...<br /><br />I think I am just not getting to the right page.. I sure would love some help getting there.&nbsp; You just dont know how much Lucy would help me right now.&nbsp; I miss her so much...<br /><br />So I am encouraged that you say there is some around to be had.... I just need to find the products page....<br /><br />Much love
