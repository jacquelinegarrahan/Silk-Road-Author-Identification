				I have been meaning to try something from the 2C family for a while now, I was going to get a bit of 2c-b to start with but then I thought why not try something try something a bit more adventurous!<br /><br />So I thought I would make a good topic. Whats your favorite and why?<br /><br />Personally im looking for something more euphoric then trippy if some one can recommend anything.

				Definitely 2c-b.....The visuals are awesome. It&#039;s very giddy high &amp; great in a social environment. That was also Shulgin&#039;s favorite RC... 8)<br />I think that also has the least amount of side effects as well.....30-35 mg&#039;s was my favorite dose...But start small if your not experience user with psychs...like 20-25 mg&#039;s.<br />Good luck...<br /><br />Jack

				2C-B is the only one I have tried but I can say that it is a FANTASTIC psychedelic. It is really astounding how good of a drug it is. I grabbed a gram of it and me and all my friends have been staying quite psychedelic and euphoric all summer long. What a beautiful substance.<br /><br />It is also amazing to add to the comedown of an MDMA session.

				I&#039;ve tried 2ce, 2ci, 2ct2, 2ct7, and 2cb and of course peyote and of all of these 2ci is my favorite.&nbsp; <br /><br />2ci is my favorite bc its 8 hours of awesomeness, it&#039;s visually interesting, nasuae isn&#039;t that bad, you can function on it if you need to or really let go and release yourself to it.&nbsp; So all around it&#039;s the best of all the 2c family...great body high and the best sex ever has been had on this drug.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />2ct2 would be second favorite - This one i&#039;ve only tried twice but it was visually different than 2ci and i&#039;m gearing up to try it again.&nbsp; The come up on 2ct2 the first time was so magical I really cannot explain but it&#039;s 2 for 2 in amazing trips.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />2ce third favorite - 2ce didn&#039;t seem to have as much &quot;warmth&quot; to it as the top 2.&nbsp; 2ce, while fun and a good time has never given me the type of life-changing trip 2ci and 2ct2 have given me.&nbsp; <br /><br />2cb fourth favorite - only last 4 hours :(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got this stuff only bc I couldn&#039;t get a hold of 2ci and it was an okay facsimile but is so short-lasting... it leaves me wanting more.&nbsp; <br /><br />2ct7 least favorite - I puked for lifetimes on this drug.&nbsp; Somewhere in another universe I am still throwing up.&nbsp; Also 2ct7 has some deaths associated with its use...or misuse I should say.&nbsp; 2ct7 has been described by my friends as &quot;mean&quot; &quot;scary&quot; and &quot;magical&quot;&nbsp; Lots of people have nasuea with this as well...more nasuaea than usually accompanies a 2c drug<br /><br />Lastly Peyote...Not a huge fan of this either bc the cactus is soooooo bitter and basic.&nbsp; Disgusting to eat, the trip is pretty cool, but not as awesome as 2ci or 2ct2.&nbsp; &nbsp;8) 8) 8)

				Your gonna want 2c-b buddy trust me, get the 2c-b from the Undeclared vendor who sells it for $80 a gram. I&#039;ve had it before he&#039;s a great vendor with pure hcl product. For the euphoria nothing top&#039;s B in my opinion, E and P come close but they have a deeper more intellectual philosophical presence to them. 2CB is the ultimate enhancing drug, its what everyone doing molly should be doing instead&nbsp; ;D

				I honestly suggest starting off with 2C-B and dabble in that for awhile before seeing if you&#039;re interested in the 2C family to begin with. They&#039;re interesting chemicals that are worth experimenting with. After 2C-B maybe look to 2C-I (which is extremely visual and intricate) then 2C-T2.

				2C-B is a wonderful chemical.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go balls-deep with new chemicals right off the bat.&nbsp; Different people react differently to things.&nbsp; Start slow with something like 2C-B.&nbsp; 2C-I might be an alternative.&nbsp; I think 2C-E might be something those people with more experience are more likely to enjoy but I haven&#039;t used it myself so my opinion doesn&#039;t mean much.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to BlueViking getting his 2C-B back in stock since he offers great product at a good price and I only do domestic.

				2cb-fly but be careful easy to over do 2ce is defnatly the most uncontrollable out of the buch tripwise. So if u want something more intense go with that or 2ci. <br /><br />My opinion on 2cb is well awsome very tactile. With your touch hearing and vision being really destorted. Voices change and so does the feel of things. I enjoy this with my lover but would rather be on the others with a group of people. 2cb can be so sexual even at doses above 25mg. I love to not even be able to see anything but patterns and colors and still be able to fuck like a champ. 2cb is more emotional wich gives a more intamant one on one trip. Dont like 2cb alone even for five mins as the others I can meditate or chill alone or with people

				&nbsp;A couple years back I happened upon 2c-t-2 and remember it being quite amazing and quite special.&nbsp; Somehow more special than 2ci, 2ce, 2cb, and 2ct7.&nbsp; I recently ordered from Morpheu5 and had quite the pleasure of receiving and trying his product. <br /><br />So I dosed my friends and myself based off the dosages I had of 2ct2 a couple years ago, and wow this stuff was way stronger. <br /><br />Our dosages were as follows:&nbsp; *Names have been changed<br /><br />40mg - Myself aka Mitch (Male 180lbs)<br /><br />24mg - Chassidy&nbsp; &nbsp;120 lbs<br /><br />26mg - Christina - 135 lbs<br /><br />35mg - Frank - 170 lbs<br /><br /><br />We took this stuff at a club…with the knowledge that if it were to be too intense we could always just cab-home.&nbsp; Wow…it was way intense. <br /><br />The 2ct2 really kicked back in our roll…we had all taken some Molly about 2.5 hours before and the 2c-t-2 made it feel like it was back full force.&nbsp; About a hour after we all took the 2ct2 we realized we needed to go home. <br /><br />The trip was super intense for me as I had taken 40mg, and it was definitely a little uncomfortable at the beginning.&nbsp; No one ever experienced any intense nasea or body-load but Cassidy threw-up once bc she was extremely new into the tripping scene. <br /><br />2.5 hours after we had dropped it, everyone was having a good time, but for most of our crew…the first little bit was a really wild ride.&nbsp; Being in a club was not a good idea.<br /><br />Our bodis all felt amazing and we all definitely took advantage of the heightened sexual energy we all had.&nbsp; As for the visuals…It seemed like someone was holding sparklers in our eyes.&nbsp; Everything we looked at kind of was just exploding with little sparks and of course the colors were very pronounced.&nbsp; After the first 2 hours, the sparkling wore off, and the traditional &quot;breathing&quot; rooms and swirling tiles of the 2c Family visuals were happening. <br /><br />I remember looking through my drawer of clothes thinking &quot;Who&#039;s Clothes are these?&quot;&nbsp; The all looked so foreign to me and the colors of all my clothes had completely changed.&nbsp; I kept thinking &quot;wow, this is so much more intense than last time.&quot;&nbsp; (Last time I dosed 2ct2 years ago it was around 32-35mg) <br /><br />We took at 1am and by 7am we were all still feeling pretty good.&nbsp; 3 of us all opted to take a little more around sunrise and we all took 6, 12, and 13mg boosters.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really feel too much more by taking the 13mg booster but i&#039;m sure it prolonged the trip for me. <br /><br />In Summary:&nbsp; I would likely take the 40mg again, but I wouldn&#039;t go any higher than that.&nbsp; My vision was seriously altered at this level and it stayed very altered for at least a couple hours.&nbsp; Once the trip settled in everyone was having a lot of fun and dancing and joking and laughing…it was a very amazing experience and hopefully someone can now base their dosage and their experience based off the notes I have given. <br /><br />My personal recommendation:&nbsp; Watch the sunrise, Paint, Swim, play winamp&#039;s Milkdrop visualizer and shower in absolute darkness, ABSOLUTE DARKNESS (No door-cracks with light coming in or else you&#039;ll rob yourself of the experience of completely losing &quot;where&quot; you are. <br />&nbsp;<br />For a more in depth list of things to do..check out this List of things to do while Tripping thread here:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=80623.msg958583#msg958583<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

Tons of anxiety. Like thier is always something more to be reached. The duration is so long that you have to plan ahead for it. It is almost a burden to use.

				Wow, no 2C-P love here??<br /><br />The only other 2C I have tries is B. But 2C-P was fucking amazing. My friend had a whole gram and it lasted us months. The first time I tried it he was like &quot;it&#039;s gonna hurt your nose, man&quot; and I have snorted nearly everything so I was unsuspecting of how bad 2C-P burns.... holy shit I did not want to be alive for that 15 minute time span.<br /><br />But then it hit me. I was on the shitter staring at my brick wall (an all too familiar sight) and the texture of the bricks pop out. Everything is so rugged and I can see the shadows cast by the miniscule bumps on the bricks. Ok, time to go back to the living room. Adult Swim is on and Superjail is playing, so fuckin trippy. My friend introduced me to the Mars Volta that night and I can safely say that is the hardest I have tripped. We dosed a second time, leading to my longest trip - 24 hours straight. <br /><br />Highlight of the night was when we were sitting on my front porch playing the melodica at about 6AM when all the neighbors were walking to the Metro bus stop to go to work. What a sight we must have been. And then we realized that we probably looked extremely sketchy so we went inside haha

				I took ~20mg then ~10mg of 2C-I several hours after taking 5-meo-mipt.&nbsp; The muscle tension was pretty bad.&nbsp; It is hard to compare it to 2C-B because I&#039;ve had different experiences between trips from the same batch of 2C-B.<br /><br />Both the 5-meo-mipt and the 2c-i wreck havoc on my digestive system.&nbsp; Eventually my system is cleared out which at least makes things easier.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious if injecting these chemicals would lessen that problem.&nbsp; I doubt I&#039;ll try with the 2C-I as it doesn&#039;t appear pure (I think the powder is both grey and white) and found the 2C-I to be mostly insoluble in water when I tried to mix it with a drink.

				Hi guys, does anyone have experience with very high dose 2C-E? I&#039;ve been steadily working my way through some for the past couple of weeks. Unfortunately due to the ridiculous length it took quite a while to get near the right dose. <br /><br />It was very nice up until 33mg orally, at 38mg it became super intense. At this dosage everything became very fractally like at the beginning or end of a breakthrough DMT trip (and the mind trip was waaaay more introspective than previously). <br /><br />What I wanted to know was, is there a point at which I will loose track of the real world? At which I will not longer be able to tell what is real and what is a hallucination? Basically an 8 hour DMT trip (albeit one in which your mind remains entirely coherent).<br /><br />Oddly I find the nervous energy/muscle tension much less annoying/difficult to deal with at the higher doses (eg above 25mg), I just wish I could stop clenching my jaw.<br /><br />Oh and my face is set like stone against snorting it. that stuff is vicious! The burn I can live with but the swelling of my sinuses is too much, especially since they stay tender and itchy for several days afterwards.<br /><br />@slirp - I can&#039;t speak from experience but reading through an old 2C-E thread on bluelight I saw several users talking about IVing 2C-E. 1 said it was great and 3 others said never to do it, the pain is excruciating and ruins the entire trip as you worry about your veins collapsing and loosing your arm :P Dunno if they have any idea what they are talking about but worth keeping in mind.

I think that combination &quot;could&quot; end up killing someone. Even if you actually DID that, I think a lot of people would find that a terrifying experience even if they were fine healthwise.<br /><br />I&#039;m extrapolating here but people have died snorting the amount of T7 that you described snorting, as well as combining a normal dose with MDMA. Probably don&#039;t want to be snorting any 2C&#039;s as they also damage nasal passageways.<br /><br />Anyway my preferences are as follows<br />1) 2C-B, very easy on the mind and body, trippy euphoria, looking at light sources usually results in a rainbows. At normal doses conversation is pretty easy and intellect is not lost. At higher doses 30+mg I tend to disassociate and it becomes difficult for me to retain my train of thought. I also get a slight headache at higher levels.<br /><br />2) 2C-E, not so easy on my body, I describe it as psychedelic nausea + increased empathy. I am usually meditating and thanking god for all the beautiful people who have affected my life during the afterglow.. My doses have ranged from 12-25mg, and I have settled on 18mg because there is less bodyload for me.<br /><br />3) 2C-I - meh, this one seemed hollow to me, but I admit quite visual. Also just kind of made me feel tingly on the skin. My least favorite 2C so far.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t (yet) tried 2C-T7, 2C-T2, or 2C-P, but plan to in the future.

				I only snort 2C-X chemicals.&nbsp; I have on a few hundred occasions.&nbsp; Yes 30mg of 2C-E and 30mg of 2C-T-2 is amazing.&nbsp; It might be lethal if you have something wrong with you.&nbsp; I would give people 30mg of 2c-E their first time tripping.&nbsp; I have a good amount of friends who have taken 50mg.&nbsp; Yes, 2C-T-7 has been reported as killing a couple people.&nbsp; That is why we only snorted up to 30mg instead of the usual 60mg that I snort with 2C-E.&nbsp; Although, how many people have died from heroin, cocaine and pain killers?&nbsp; I mixed 120mg of 2C-T-2, 2C-E and 2C-T-7 and snorted it before.&nbsp; I did feel like I might die that time.&nbsp; I could not figure out how to open a window or turn on a sink fuacet.&nbsp; I laid down in a cold shower and puked.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like 2C-T-7.&nbsp; After puking I had a great time.&nbsp; The visuals were insanely intense.<br /><br />Only 2C-T-7 gives me nausea.&nbsp; I see people IRL get nauseafrom all of the 2C-X chemicals though.

				2c-i is somewhat of a waste, way to much body load for the amount of effects experienced. It&#039;s a mild psychedelic and a mild etacnogen. If you want to roll, take X, if you want to trip take something else. That being said, some people love it, like my mother.<br /><br /><br />2c-e however is VERY visual and wonderful, I love the stuff, assuming you get a really good batch it&#039;ll take your fuckin&#039; socks off.<br /><br /><br />2c-p is also quite fun as it has less body load and last many hours longer than 2c-e, great for all night parties.

				Shulgin reported 2C-E as being difficult and he only worked his way up to a 25mg dose I think.&nbsp; If his report was more positive maybe 2C-E would be more popular.<br /><br />I made an injectable solution out of 2C-E and while I&#039;m still experimenting with it I think I&#039;m pretty happy with it.<br /><br />Still, I&#039;m looking forward to BlueViking getting 2C-B in stock again.

				For some strange reason 2C-T-X&#039;s don&#039;t really affect me. 2C-E is one of my favorites it&#039;s also a great emergency kit for whenever your acid fails.<br /><br />Have had some really rough nights with our good &#039;ol friend 2C-E, orally, snorting that fucker. Oh lord, i will never forget that nasty acid like burning drip.<br /><br />Must have went through a few 100 milligrams that night, basically took a whole rock of clumped up powder and started throwing it in our drinks, snorting it from a knife.<br /><br />Everything was still moving and glowing for about 48 hours after i woke up again<br /><br />Good old times&nbsp; ;D Not sure if i can handle such amounts nowadays.

His 2c-e was pretty much the exact same thing, in fact I couldn&#039;t even tall it apart from his 2c-i, it might as well have been the same chemical. Kwiktrips chemicals were VERY different, if given on and not told which I would instantly know based on the visuals, muscle tension and intensity alone. Makhala&#039;s drugs seemed to all be very vague and similar.<br /><br />Does anyone know why this might be? The obvious answer is that something was not as it was labeled (or sold), but assuming they were ALL the chemical they were sold as is there any other explanation as to why the chemicals might have been so different from 2 separate vendors?
