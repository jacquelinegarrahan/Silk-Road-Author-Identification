				i originally wrote a long and rambling post about my whole history with DMT, but decided to ax it and mostly talk about my experiences as of late:<br /><br />i tried DMT years ago and scared myself shitless.&nbsp; i was headstrong and cocky about psychedelics and was so eager to dive right into the deep end of DMT, hard and fast.&nbsp; it was way more than i had bargained for.<br /><br />so i thought about my experiences.&nbsp; for a few years actually.&nbsp; i had tried smoking it again a couple times but would get the shakes so bad i couldn&#039;t hold the lighter.<br /><br />for some reason though, i knew i wanted to use it again.&nbsp; so i got some MHRB and did an extraction, and then just held on to it for about a year or two.&nbsp; my wife was excited and bought a glass vapor genie.&nbsp; but i remained apprehensive.<br /><br />so i don&#039;t know what happened, but lately i just started going for it and smoking the stuff...and it has been FANTASTIC.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been keeping my doses low, so far, slowly working my way up...i started with 10, then 15, then 20, etc.&nbsp; the last couple times i smoked, i was kinda bummed that i hadn&#039;t put more in the pipe.<br /><br />i think my problem before was that my goal was to get as big of a hit as possible and then go fucking mental for 5 minutes.&nbsp; but now, i&#039;ll take a normal hit and let it mellow...see where it takes me.&nbsp; i&#039;ll take another hit or two (oooo, the GVG hits so smooth) until the walls melt around me, which is endlessly entertaining.&nbsp; it feels like a full body orgasm, every time;&nbsp; it is just that wonderful.&nbsp; sometimes the feeling is so overwhelmingly good that i just close my eyes and have a major moment of &quot;space out.&quot;&nbsp; its like taking a hit of nitrous after a bump of K while tripping on acid.&nbsp; but then it all fades and within 15-20 minutes of my last toke i&#039;m back to back to baseline with absolutely no hangover.&nbsp; i just go about my day.&nbsp; its actually, the opposite of a hangover....i feel better, sharper...<br /><br />the best day goes like this:&nbsp; i wake up, go to the gym for a 45 min workout.&nbsp; come back home, take my dog out for a walk, then crawl back into bed with a bowl of DMT, trip balls for 15 min, then go make breakfast/coffee, shower, and get to work.&nbsp; that thing about it being &quot;the businessman&#039;s trip&quot; has had me laughing a few times when i&#039;m doing work an hour after tripping balls.<br /><br />to be able to enjoy DMT to the extent that i currently do, i had to unlearn everything i had read or heard about it.&nbsp; all the shit about gnomes and alternate realities and peeking at the afterlife....forget all that shit.&nbsp; learn to dance with confusion and not care about quantifying or explaining things.&nbsp; just tell yourself &quot;there&#039;s only now.&quot;&nbsp; and go slow, because DMT is the real deal magic spice...not for kiddies.&nbsp; learned that the hard way.<br /><br />its been over 6 years since my first toke and i feel like my relationship with this drug is just beginning.&nbsp; so i&#039;m certainly no expert, but i&#039;m starting to get the feeling that DMT is a very malleable drug experience.&nbsp; in other words:&nbsp; DMT is whatever you want it to be.&nbsp; if you want mystery you&#039;ll get it, if you are afraid you&#039;ll get fear, if you want psychedelic bliss...well, thats what i&#039;ve been getting lately :)<br /><br />hope some other seekers out there find their way to the loving embrace of this non-drug.

				The highest thing one can experience is cosmic consciousness-- the sense of complete, fundamental, total unity, forever and ever, with the whole universe.. As Watts often liked to say, cosmic consciousness is that than which there is no whicher. You can&#039;t get any spiritually &quot;higher&quot; than that. I have been able to attain this state on LSD and mushrooms, but never on DMT. So to answer the question, it&#039;s a wonderful drug, but I&#039;d place DMT somewhat below the classical psycehdelics. It&#039;s an interesting experience, but it&#039;s an aesthetic and hallucinatory experience, not what I would call a spiritual experience.

				i find DMT as a MUCH more &quot;mentally&quot; easier drug than LSD , and also much less spiritual - but as stated , it is very subjective...

				I classify drugs according to their effects on consciousness. <br /><br />Emotional-social. consciousness: Alcohol, amphetamines, LSD.<br /><br />Sensory-somatic consciousness: Marijuana, MDA, LSD.<br /><br />Aesthetic consciousness: DMT, mushrooms, marijuana, LSD.<br /><br />Astral-imaginal consciousness: DMT, mushrooms, LSD.<br /><br />Cosmic consciousness: LSD, mushrooms, mescaline.<br /><br />It will be noted that LSD is perhaps unique in that it can induce all levels of consciousness, although with respect to astral-imaginal consciousness, DMT is undoubtedly superior to LSD.<br /><br />Nevertheless, you can&#039;t get any higher than cosmic consciousness, whether through psychedelics or other methods. Everything else is form, creation, Maya, potentiality. And that includes astral-imaginal entities just as much as the physical world.<br /><br />Can you experience cosmic consciousness on DMT? Perhaps, but astral-imaginal seems to be the norm.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i&#039;m also confused as to why you classify LSD and Psilocybin as &quot;spiritual&quot; and DMT as &quot;not spiritual.&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, the word spiritual is used in different senses by different people. A lot of people would use it in a sense that encompasses both astral-imaginal consciousness and cosmic consciousness. If that&#039;s how you are using the word spiritual, then I agree with you; DMT is very spiritual, in the sense. I&#039;d just place cosmic consciousness above astral-imaginal consciousness, and therefore I would consider mushrooms and LSD to be &#039;better&#039; than DMT, at least for spiritual purposes.

				Two days ago I&#039;ve tried DMT for the first time. Actually it was changa. What was a surprise for me is that the experience was VERY friendly. I was laughing and jumping when is was over. And it was very short. After 15 min I felt absolutely sober and wonderful.

				dmt really is a wondrous little chemical. i think what fascinates me the most about it is the fact that it&#039;s so widespread in the natural world and (to my knowledge) is the only psychedelic endogenous to the human body. there&#039;s really nothing else like it.

				What a nice thread.<br />OP&#039;s post was surely a very nice read.<br />I&#039;ve done some LSD, mushrooms etc.<br />Now, I think it&#039;s the time to try something &quot;new&quot; and I&#039;m really looking forward to try out DMT.<br />But of course I have some basic question, hope you don&#039;t mind, guys:<br /><br />Due to being new to DMT, I&#039;m looking forward to buy N, N-DMT (freebase) and I want it to smoke, is there maybe a cheap vaporizer you guys could recommend? And another thing that I don&#039;t get, do I put only the N, N-DMT in the vaporizer and smoke it or does I have to mix it with e.g. tobacco?<br /><br />http://www.vaporgenie.com/products/hand-carved-vg-vaporizers/handcarved-straight-walnut-details<br /><br />This one is recommended in a listing, but to be honest, as a first-time consumer I&#039;d prefer something less expensive.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already read about the dosage etc.<br />Anyway, any advice of you guys is really appreciated.

				Sandwiching the spice in a bed of herb helps cut back waste during combustion. If you draw the flame slowly towards the bowl, taking your time with a slow inhalation, you&#039;ll practically vaporize the stuff and waste will be minimum. I personally use mullein leaves to sandwich the spice because they cover perfectly and help alleviate the harsh smoke, but I&#039;ve read about people using oregano and other common herbs. As tempting as it may be, don&#039;t use MJ because she burns hot no matter how careful you are. Save that bowl for after.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I have a little launch box vaporizor but still use a glass chillum when smoking DMT. Remember, hold that shit in! This should be your primary concern if worried about waste.<br /><br />The nexus is a great community, I recommend checking it out for all your DMT queries.
