				So I convinced my psychiatrist I have ADHD.<br /><br />I am currently prescribed Ritalin.<br /><br />My goal is to get a dexedrine prescription.<br /><br />What should I say to my psychiatrist to convince him to switch me to dexedrine, without raising any red flags?<br /><br />Ritalin gives me a headache and makes me sleepy. I don&#039;t like it. But I don&#039;t want to be switched to focalin. I want dexedrine.

				Were you just recently prescribed ritalin? At any rate, all you have to do is this- when you return for your next followup and they inquire as to how it&#039;s going just tell them the truth. It gives you headaches. Maybe... anxiety and irritability too? Right? Right. Maybe it helps to some degree, but the those side effects kinda negate it. <br /><br />Ritalin is often the drug they&#039;ll try first. It&#039;s often the case that it doesn&#039;t go over well due to side effects. From there they may try Concerta (extended release). More likely, they&#039;ll move on to try an amphetamine. Depending on where you are located, they&#039;ll try either adderall (or xr), vyvanse (essentially dexedrine xr), or dexedrine. Or a combination. They may allow you to participate in the choice. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like their decission just be cool and address it in the next followup and they&#039;ll tweak your Rx further. And so on. Eventuallyyou&#039;ll be prescribed what works best for you (or what you desire, hopefully it&#039;s both).<br /><br />Lucky for you, you don&#039;t even need to be dishonest. Just be honest about the side effects, maybe slighty exagerate the severity.<br /><br />Stratera is probably off the table at this point considering you&#039;ve already been prescribed a true stimulant. Unless you come off as a drug seeker, it&#039;s unlikely that Stratera would come up again unless it was some last resort attempt if all other meds failed.<br /><br />Patience and will reward you.

				I got lucky when I pulled a fast one on my doc. The psychiatrist he sent me to for diagnosis literally just asked me what I wanted. He was like, &quot;Have you ever taken any of your friend&#039;s medications? Do you have an idea of what would work best for you?&quot; I was all, &quot;Well I&#039;m not totally sure what it was exactly, but I believe it was called Adderall. That seemed to work really well for me.&quot; hah.<br /><br />Unfortunately my insurance ran out and I moved so now I&#039;d have to pay like $200 (what I owe) for the doc to send my medical records to a new doc to start prescribing them to me again. Those things made me act like a lunatic anyway, and I had to drink every night to be able to sleep.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried Dexedrine. Sounds sexy.<br /><br />P.S. I think it&#039;d be hard to give you much advice on this, since all doctors are different. I got my doc to raise my script up to 60 30mg from 30, but I think he specifically asked me if I felt like I needed more. You have to kind of observe, try to passively/casually mention things and gauge their reactions... I think it&#039;d be kind of hard to mention specific names unless he asks you, it might come off as drug-seeking behavior. Maybe just keep acting like you&#039;re having bad reactions until he prescribes you that one?
