				Do I need to test it? I don&#039;t currently have a test kit and I want to roll tomorrow. I just received speakers from SuperTrips and pretty much everyone on here is saying his MDMA is good. <br />Also I was planning to do a ~120mg dose and then a ~60mg re dose a couple hours later, but I&#039;m wondering since this is my first time with MDMA should I just try a roll with 40mg or something first just to make sure it&#039;s safe? I would do this without hesitation but I&#039;m concerned that if I do that then I&#039;ll have to wait a month or something to do the ~120+60 mg roll. What do you think?

				I would say that you don&#039;t need to test it as its from a rep&#039;d vender and renowned for being good MDMA. But you can never be 100% sure I guess. As long as its got that lovely safrole smell to it as well :)<br />Depending on your weight I would say start off with more like 160mg. This is when a strong sense of empathy kicks in, for me anyway and I&#039;m only ~75kgs! Stick with the 60mg re-dose as you hit the peak, that&#039;s a good re-dose amount.<br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend to take only 40mg&#039;s initially, you almost certainly wouldn&#039;t feel anything. <br />Also I&#039;d recommend to pre/post-load with vitamins such as C, B6 and 12. Also take a magnesium and zinc supplement before you roll as this will help with the gurning. <br />A bit of 5HTP and a good diet with lots of red meats will help with the comedown IME as well.<br />

				For your first time 150-200mg of some good shit should have you set for the whole night. You probably won&#039;t experience a hangover, you&#039;ll probably actually feel great the next day. Wish I still felt like that after every time =P

				You will probably puke up, have a bin close by. Don&#039;t eat before taking it.<br /><br />You&#039;ll be fine this one time, but for future look into 5-HTP to ease the comedown (some say it works, some don&#039;t) and 1000mg Vitamin C supplements for the anti-oxidant effect (take one before and after rolling, vitamin C doesn&#039;t stay in the body long.<br /><br />I would just go with the 120+60 first.<br /><br />You will sweat a lot, wear loose clothing and keep some cold drinks nearby, and an old t-shirt or something to wipe the sweat off your face etc.<br /><br />You will have the urge to take more while rolling, because you think &quot;why not? everything is cool&quot;, when I rolled last night I ended up taking x6 caps and I still think I&#039;m either slightly rolling right now or it&#039;s just some afterglow, but I have that weird head-space feeling, you know? It&#039;s been almost 24 hours and i&#039;m only now starting to feel normal and clear-headed again. So yeah, don&#039;t have any more MDMA nearby while rolling or you might take too much, I must have had at least 500mg last night.<br /><br />Was my second time taking MDMA so these are new things to me aswell.

				Yeah remember to drop on an empty stomach as it will be way more effective and won&#039;t make you feel (as) sick.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41375.msg454729#msg454729">Quote from: quantaflux on September 07, 2012, 10:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You will have the urge to take more while rolling, because you think &quot;why not? everything is cool&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Very true! Be careful whilst you&#039;re on it.<br />I&#039;d go with 160mg though still. As it&#039;s your first time and you want it to be as good as possible! First time is always your best time. ;) <br />Also as it all starts to hit you you may feel all overwhelmed, don&#039;t worry this is completely normal! Lasts for probably 60seconds, for me anyway :)

				All the above posters give solid advice--I just wanted to add my experience that my first MDMA roll I did alone on a small dosage: about 75-80mg. I felt good and so did<br />everything else for close to 2-3 hours. I think I&#039;m normally susceptible to drug effects(or was when I first tried it). I think if you want to do it a couple times over the <br />course of a month or two, try a low dosage your first time and see what you think. <br /><br />If your first time is when you plan to be out partying: go for a 150~mg dose or so<br />and redose half of that in 2-3 hours to keep yourself rolling if it&#039;s an all night affair. Just remember that the more/harder you roll, the longer you&#039;re going to have to<br />wait to try it again unless you want your tolerance to rocket and neurotoxicity/bad after effects to catch up to you.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				Anyone know when I will next be able to roll properly after taking at least 500mg last night? I have some 5-HTP which i&#039;ll be taking to try and speed up the recovery process, but is 1 week long enough time? I hear people say you should only do it once a month.<br /><br />Also, my first time, I think I ended up taking 3 caps or even 4, because of the whole &quot;everything&#039;s cool, just take moooore&quot; thing, and for some reason I ripped up a DVD case and threw some DVDs around and scratched them, woke up in the morning with no memory of that whatsoever or why I would do that.

				Thanks for the replies! I will definitely pre/post load. I&#039;ve got some Vitamin C, B and 5-HTP. I&#039;ll get some magnesium. <br />What does a re dose do compared to just taking it all at once ? I was just reading snoopish&#039;s reply about a re dose being unable to increase the empathy, will this apply to me as well or does it apply more to higher doses because of increased/quicker serotonin depletion with them?

I was just super high and I didn&#039;t want it to end so I kept thinking it was a good idea to take another, and by the morning I&#039;d eaten all 5 caps. I want to stick to around 100-125 which is probably just 1 of my caps.<br /><br />I have done it once before last week, and I didn&#039;t roll as hard as I did this time even after eating 5-HTP all week.<br /><br /><br />I was wondering about that though. According to here: http://thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html or some other page on there, what happens with MDMA is your serotonin RECEPTORS will &quot;retract&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; themselves from the flood of serotonin, and it is those receptors that you need to coax back out of hiding before you can roll again, which, if true, why would taking 5-HTP help (adding more serotonin, while the receptors are still stinging from the last flood of it)

				I&#039;ve never pre or post loaded before any rolls, ever, and also never have hangovers or ill effects following rolling.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have some 5-HTP but haven&#039;t really used it yet, I might try it just for the sake of trying it.<br /><br />My first time was on pure, and I think I&#039;ve never tried pills but once, had a horrible time...&nbsp; My friends don&#039;t like the potential for other shit to pop up in pills so we usually just cap our own molly and always stay pure with it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just cleaner feeling and doesn&#039;t run the risk of being cut with all manner of gross shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, first time I rolled was 100mg, lasted about 3-4 hours and was pretty chill, we weren&#039;t surrounded by sensory overload though which seems to amplify the effects of molly tenfold.&nbsp; I had a great time even just hanging out with my g/f all night on that 100mg.<br /><br />My usual dose now is 150mg with a 50mg boost ~1:00-1:30 in.&nbsp; It&#039;s plenty intense, but I might start doing 200 +100s soon, just to see how much more intense I can handle, but that&#039;s likely my upper limit.&nbsp; Stay safe, it&#039;s easy to get arrogant and overdo it with Molly, and thats when she starts to get revenge.&nbsp; Stay nice to her, and she will remain faithful to you.

The redose is mostly to keep your energy up and allow you to keep dancing or some such. Even if you pop another 2g of MDMA(please don&#039;t ever do), the drugs you put in your body can only coax so much out of your mind before your mind is spent. In this case, your mind&#039;s pleasure drugs are all used up after the first 150mg roll. The redose is just to keep giving you that amphetamine-style energy.<br /><br />Glad to hear you don&#039;t plan on another .5g run. Be safe and good luck!

				I&#039;m also doing this for the first time. Well, not really -- but the one timeI tried it I took way too small a dose (maybe 40 or 50) ...I could feel it, but not like what I&#039;d expect.<br /><br />So for tonight (fingers crossed that it comes in the mail today!) I have two 100mg capsules from jackrabbit31. Thinking of taking both at once. But now you guys are making me think about redosing. How long into it before you redose? Should I empty the capsules?<br /><br />is MDMA stupid to do alone? My plan was to play and compose music all night, maybe go out dancing later if I felt it...<br /><br />any other tricks?

				MDMA is a total waste if you&#039;re alone.&nbsp; It&#039;ll feel nice but then you get this overwhelming urge to be around people and be social, or to do something stimulating.&nbsp; I would advise against dropping it alone, 50mg would be ok if you just want a nice buzz but I still feel like it&#039;s a waste outside of a party with loud music and lights.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to redose do it ~1 hr - 1:30 after taking the first seems to be the sweet spot.&nbsp; Basically once it comes up and you&#039;re peaking drop the 2nd dose to extend your roll for 2-3 more hours or so.&nbsp; I prefer to do 150 +50, sometimes 200 +50, you really don&#039;t need much on the redose to get the desired duration.&nbsp; For shorter events I&#039;d say just bomb 200 and roll hard for 3-4 hrs.&nbsp; Most music events here peak by 11 and end by 1:30 or so, so unless its an all-night rave I usually don&#039;t redose.

				How long does it take for 5-HTP to convert into serotonin? <br /><br />How close to a roll can you take 5-HTP before you are hindering rather than helping?<br /><br />Do we know how much a single 1000mg 5-HTP tablet gives, like, in % of optimal serotonin?<br /><br />And at what points in time are optimal for taking vitamin c for a roll? how long do the oxidants stay in your system? (and how long would the protective effects of 1000mg VitC last? I read Vit C is excreted in the urine after only 30 mins or something)

				So I rolled yesterday, I ended up taking ~120mg and then I decided not to redose because I was feeling so good about myself, I felt protective of myself and that &quot;I must not damage my body. I have to take care of myself.&quot; The experience was quite something. I was seeing closed eye visuals for a small bit as well as seeing double. Not having done any sort of psychedelic or had any experience like this in my life before I briefly wondered if I was dying. I reassured myself that I would be back to normal in a few hours. I didn&#039;t have much motivation to get up and do much so I&#039;m guessing that there was little/no caffeine in it. I took it for my PTSD and it was/is surprising how MDMA makes you FEEL things. I was able to think through a ton of really painful experiences in my life without quickly numbing out to them like I normally do, I didn&#039;t have to try to be calm or courageous to face things, it was like the drug just did it. I&#039;m a little overwhelmed I never expected this to happen. And I never expected some of the stuff that came up to come up. Now that it&#039;s over it&#039;s a little bit intimidating/tough handling all these difficult realizations/memories that came up. It was a bit of a surreal experience getting these ordinary looking pills in the mail from Germany and then getting this done to my brain. I felt very alert on the MDMA, time seemed to be going by twice as slowly. I would think 7 minutes had past and it was only like 3 minutes when I looked at my watch. I notice that it is a lot easier to think, my concentration feels better at the moment (I&#039;m not sure if this is just afterglow though, time still seems to be a bit slower. My mind feels so clear, I felt like I have my concentration back. I don&#039;t know what I was doing with half of my concentration before or if I was in a partially inattentive state just from the energy it took to constantly numb myself to the trauma. Is this just a regular reaction to MDMA ? I can&#039;t say I am having a huge afterglow of being super social or feeling really good/great about myself though. I remember the realizations I had and the lack of shame on the drug but I&#039;m feeling a bit depressed/irritable today.

				My first roll was magical, I suggest do it at home with someone you love, I don&#039;t think the going out club thing is the best way to spend a roll. It can be sooo much more of a productive experience.<br />Get some candies; jollyranchers. reeses peices, etc.<br />Try putting ice on your face.<br />Take a bath<br />Take some magnesium about an hour previous.<br />Watch out for your teeth, if you are really worried get a dental guard or something of that nature.<br />Avoid the 5-htrp until afterwards, take one every 8 hours (set alarms on your phone to remind you / wake you up) it&#039;ll fix you quicker and prolong the afterglow. Beforehand it&#039;s not needed.<br /><br />Stop all pyscotropic medications a month beforehand, dont eat before hand, if your hungry have a light smoothy or some orange juice.

Another time solo was chillin at home on the PC I dd contact some mates which I wish I didn&#039;t do as they knew i was rolling but anyways

				@OP: I think most of what you experienced is rather normal. Working through tough issues while on MDMA is a tried therapeutic method. While I typically enjoyed a decent afterglow, this may be mitigated for you by the issues you dredged up while rolling. <br /><br />Cheers

				Alicecake, are you glad you rolled alone?<br /><br />Would you suggest any kind of planned agenda to get the most out of the experience?

				I can&#039;t talk for the above substance as I haven&#039;t used it but I have another antioxidant drug that I use just after I drop and again as I&#039;m coming down. Also, next time I roll (or use any stim), I plan to add ~2mg piracetam to the coming up dose and see how that effects me. <br /><br />*Note that I typically stick to lower dosages of this stuff* <br /><br />Cheers
