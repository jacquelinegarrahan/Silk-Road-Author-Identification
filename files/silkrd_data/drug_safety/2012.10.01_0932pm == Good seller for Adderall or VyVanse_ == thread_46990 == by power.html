				As a vendor of both of these products, I&#039;ll chime in on this one. Here are some of the reasons, in no particular order:<br /><br />1 - Supply/demand. While other drugs can be synthesized naturally, the amount of prescription amphetamines in existence is limited to the population that 1) has prescriptions for adderall or vyvanse (or access to someone who can get a prescription) and the smaller subset of that group that can handle and is willing to deal with the part time job of being an SR vendor. This is no small feat. The amount of prescription amphetamines coming into the world is controlled every year by national regulations, as shown by the shortage last year where both of these drugs simply weren&#039;t available regularly for 6-8 months. Additionally, the odds of someone ripping off authentic product somewhere along the supply chain are infinitesimal because of how tightly controlled amphetamines are. All of that being said, a supply that took me months to accumulate was drained in a matter of less than 2 weeks EVEN at standard SR pricing. My impression is that the demand on the market here is simply higher than what any vendor could get their hands on given the national output. I don&#039;t know what other vendors do, but I have started adjusting my prices based on my current remaining supply. I do this so that customers who REALLY prefer to work with me have the ability to do this despite a demand that would be impossible for me to keep up with. In an ideal world, I&#039;d have an unlimited supply and this wouldn&#039;t be a problem<br /><br />2 - Time. Shit takes forever. Seriously. And the prices you see aren&#039;t close to what we actually get out. It has to go through SEVERAL layers of fees and conversion penalties before it hits anything we can use. Given this plus the time it takes to acquire and package everything without a single fingerprint touching anything, as well as doing regular drops so customers will get their orders quickly - it really is a part time job. Now lets compare SR to being THAT guy in your college town that everyone goes to... take exponentially more hours. I&#039;m not kidding here. I&#039;d estimate for in the &quot;in-person&quot; case, you could make $500 with 1 hour easily. It might be $100 for 1 hour here because of the time setting up processes, acquiring materials cleanly, shipping, exchanging, transferring, messaging, withdrawing, withdrawing, cleaning, cleaning more, depositing bla bla bla. These are super rough estimates just for demonstrating, so don&#039;t go nuts over the numbers here.<br /><br />3 - Risk. Wandering onto your college campus may work (and I might recommend this if you know a trusted dealer) but it is MUCH higher risk than SR. I personally have a friend where a college bust was done at his school and they took every kid&#039;s cell phone (it was a private school so this wasn&#039;t banned) and tracked down entire drug circles of various dealings including amphetamine transactions, acid synthesis labs, high profile pot and coke dealers, etc. Suspended and expelled over 60 students. In several cases, buyers might not have even done anything out of line, but they busted one seller, took his phone, and everyone involved got screwed. A lot of the buyers were otherwise good students that just wanted adderall for their finals, and now they have a nice suspension on their record and in many cases criminal charges as well. So it can happen.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s look at SR. Nearly ALL of the risk is now transferred to the vendors, as buyers have plausible deniability for packages shipped to them.<br /><br />I&#039;ll end on this note: I do love the SR community - I&#039;m proud to be able to contribute and have happy customers that enjoy what I&#039;m shipping. I very recently had to raise my prices because I literally just can&#039;t keep up with the demand and will likely sell out of everything for a month or more despite having access to a RIDICULOUS amount of pills. We are doing the best we can here, and not trying to rip buyers off, there are just too damn many of ya.<br /><br />Hope this helps. <br />And to agree with M364M1ND, Vyvanse is indeed the shizznit.<br />NZT

I trust it because boymaster has perfect rating and everyone is saying his stuff is the real deal. The only reason I would be cautious to try the non-pharma stuff is because of doubts about its purity.

You can either tell them you don&#039;t trust SSRI&#039;s, or agree to take them and then return to the docs in a month or so and tell them that the shit didn&#039;t help or actually made you worse. That&#039;s happened to a lot of friends of mine when docs first tried to put them on ADD/ADHD meds. <br /><br />Eventually they&#039;ll go and prescribe you either concerta ( seems like most docs do this ) or a low dosage of adderall. <br /><br />The best possible thing you can get is vyvanse, since it&#039;s mostly ( i think all if I remember correctly ) dextroamphetamine which is part of the amphetamine racemate that&#039;s responsible for the positive effects.

				I don&#039;t encourage faking some shit at the docs to get them to scribe you some speed. Its not nearly as good when you take it regularly, its just a helpful tool not some recreational shit. And if you&#039;re just trying to make money, do it some other way goddamn im not down with that conman shit.&nbsp; What we need is integrity from doctors and people rehearsing some script to say to a doc to get pills is not something I support.

				I would have to agree with whoever said go see a doctor.&nbsp; Truth be told you don&#039;t need a doctor.&nbsp; I used to get mine from a nurse practitioner.&nbsp; The whole thing is such a scam.&nbsp; The doctors and nurse practitioners are glorified dealers with licenses.&nbsp; You go in and are evaluated as to whether or not you are add.&nbsp; It is easy as can be to take there exams and fail (I mean pass) so you are given 3 scripts every 3 months.&nbsp; You have to come come back every 3 months to keep it going.&nbsp; If you ever got popped for having them sent to you the best defense I could think of would be to go to a doctor and see how quickly they will write you a script.&nbsp; The most difficult part is getting an appointment in the first place.&nbsp; Once you are in you are set but it is a pain in the ass which is the only justification I could see for the prices here are so high.&nbsp; I have a friend who I referred to my nurse practitioner that told my nurse practitioner he had insurance but preferred to pay cash for the appointment as well as the prescription over insurance so it would not go against his mib (medical information bureau).&nbsp; She had no problem with that and even said it was a good idea.&nbsp; Good luck getting a prescription for adderall or vyvanse even though you don&#039;t need it.&nbsp; Just look in the yellow pages under add/adhd.&nbsp; If you call and cannot get a script you need to just give up because you probably could not catch crabs at a mexican whore house either.&nbsp;

Methamphetamine is one kind (illegal) you&#039;ve heard of but, amphetamines generally are not illegal and are approved by the FDA. Check wikipedia and my seller pages for info on adderall (dextroamphetamine + amphetamine salt combos) and dextroamphetamine (pure dextroamphetamine) for some good info on those. The other 2 popular options are focalin and concerta (dexylmethylphenidate products).

				I was actually surprised to find out Methamphetamine was a Schedule II drug the other day. It has theraputic uses, but like anything of this nature it can also be abused.

				Anything that is currently being prescribed, for Meth its &#039;Desoxyn&#039;, is Schedule II or lower because according to DEA Schedule I is reserved only for drugs with absolutely no medical value (aka Marijuana, hah).<br /><br />How they justify Cocaine being schedule II baffles me.&nbsp; I know it can make you numb, but if thats the only medicinal value its got, then that is a fuckin joke. Like Heroin doesn&#039;t kill pain? Hah.<br /><br />But Meth is prescribed rarely (notice that smoking Crystal Meth is not prescribed ever), so that kinda makes sense according to their logic.

Honestly, and I mean no offense by this, you probably shouldn&#039;t take adderall. I&#039;m not your parents and I don&#039;t have a reason to care but as a piece of info your body is definitely still developing and creating neural pathways you&#039;ll use for the rest of your life. Don&#039;t go fucking these up too early. Adderall and similar products flood the brain with abnormal amounts of dopamine and seretonin and can affect how you&#039;ll perceive those chemicals (and thus your ability to focus and/or be happy) for the rest of your life. Your parents were wrong for saying all drugs are for losers but there&#039;s a time and a place for everything, and that time is college. There are way less potent things that would work for you, at your age - ritalin is a great example. I&#039;d give that a try before touching adderall.

I do know that people in high school have good luck with ritalin so that might be the best bet if anything for now.<br />Honestly, any amphetamine is not something really to &quot;try&quot; just for fun, think of it more as a tool to help you get done what you need to get done, in the same way a computer helps you connect to the internet. Vyvanse is the only exception here but that&#039;s a very new product. Read my listing page on that for more info. I can say when I was 15, nothing i was doing required amphetamines. It&#039;s really ideal for like college finals, job interviews, moving, road trips, etc but not something that you should necessarily want to try just because.<br /><br />Second, you&#039;re overthinking the consequences of being caught over 18. 18-21 is still considered young - the law and others mostly look past silly mistakes that people make if caught and many states even have first offender clauses for people in those age ranges to get off without a record. Because you&#039;re independent, if you&#039;re smart about it you&#039;re also much less likely to be caught if you don&#039;t piss anyone off and keep your head down. It&#039;s not like you&#039;ll be found with a pill of adderall and thrown in prison... at least in basically every state I know. But being smart about it (and any drug use) is key.<br />Now to LSD/mushrooms - THAT is something you should want to try to experience. Totally mind altering/amazing. With adderall you&#039;re still very much in your head, but acid/shrooms and any psilocybin type drug helps to separate you from the real world, in a really good way. It&#039;s important that you&#039;re in a good space and with good company, particularly your first time, but that&#039;s definitely something worth trying. Wait til your senior year when you and 1-2 buddies are 17-18 - get 2-3 hits and make a night out of it. Beware as shrooms last 8 hours, acid 12.

				LSD is a 12<br /><br />And yeah, to the kid who&#039;s 15 years old.&nbsp; You should really enjoy not having any serious responsibilities for a few more years.&nbsp; There will be plenty of time for Adderall when you have a 20 page paper to write if you go to college, or when you have to work a 12 hour shift, or when you have class all day and then work at night (like me currently).&nbsp; There is no reason to use Adderall for the fuck of it, its a tool, and its a tool that you have no use for yet.

I wont touch Adderall or Amps in general, I&#039;l use that when I actually need it. I am going to try 2c-b, a friend told me 25B-NBOMe is better then 2c-b, and cheaper. Anyway, I will properly try acid, only once, when I look at the prices on here, it likes 5 blotters of 250ug for 120$. Which as far as I know, is expensive. I probably wont touch anything like meth or coke, scary. :P
