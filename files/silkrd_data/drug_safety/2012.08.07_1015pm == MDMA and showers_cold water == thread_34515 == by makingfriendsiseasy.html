				Hi guys,<br /><br />When I first started taking MDMA a little over a year ago, one of the first things a few different friends told me was to never get in a shower or jump in a pool whilst really high on it, as it could be really dangerous. They weren&#039;t specific as to what would happen, but they implied something like going into shock. Lately, I&#039;ve read trip reports by people saying they had showers and felt amazing, even one guy who said he went to a water park.<br /><br />Is there anything to this thing about MDMA and showers, or is it just baloney? Any other related safety tips you have for MDMA would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Your friend probly read a report of someone mangled on MDMA and the sudden change in body temperature caused them to lose consciousness. This is a physiological possibility when dealing with drugs that affect your body temperature.<br /><br />So although this is liekly a possibility, I would guess such adverse effects are rare when taking moderate doses. Personally, I have had many showers on MDMA even after redosing 2 times after the initial dose. I would say go ahead and take a shower, but run the water over you at a temperature similar to your body temp at the time. From there, you should slowly adjust the temperature either lower or higher depending on your preference. At the peak of your MDMA trip, I would advise not using water that is much hotter than you current body temp, as overheating can cause adverse reactions. When I shower on M, I usually use water about 10-20 Celcius greater than my perceived body temp.<br /><br />If you suffer from cardiac conditions or haven&#039;t slept for a few days, remember that your risks for any adverse effects are greater. <br /><br />Good of you to come discuss your issue here instead of believing someone else&#039;s speculation. Always do research before doing anything which may cause unintended adverse effects.

				Complete bullshit lol... I went to EDC and rolled like retard. I took probably about a gram of some pretty dank molly over the course of the night. Stupid, I know. I have never been so rolled out in my life (and I&#039;ve rolled a ton). I couldn&#039;t even stand up that&#039;s how bad it was lol. When we got back to the hotel we hopped right into the pool and everyone seemed to be fine. <br /><br />The one thing I could see happening though is.... When I&#039;m rolling hard and I swim, I feel like I can hold my breath forever. One can just submerge and easily stay under 1.5 - 2x as long as when he/she is sober. If you were uber wasted and felt like you weren&#039;t needing oxygen, I could definitely see passing out and drowning.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s a long shot, though.

				I&#039;ve been swimming and diving competitively for years now (mainly diving) and they&#039;re both fun as shit on MDMA. Never would compete on them, and I&#039;m not good enough to be tested or anything, but it&#039;s fun to do while rolling. Ever done several flips in a row while rolling hard as shit, only to do a back flop into an ice cold pool? Feels fucking incredible, doesn&#039;t even hurt. But I&#039;d recommend a cold shower first maybe.

				Well, losing consciousness is probably unlikely, but, in my experience, if you try to alter your body-temperature too drastically (especially from warm to cold), your body might tell you to slow the fuck down by giving you sudden and intense nausea.

				In my post I was referring to the fact that showers can emit hot water as well as cold. A typical pool temperature should very rarely have any adverse effects, and in fact more regulatory effects, as it will prevent you from overheating. <br /><br />Much of the posts here are anecdotal, and does prove that things like swimming are safe and fun. But I can&#039;t stress enough that extreme changes in body temperature can cause adverse effects. Especially if you&#039;ve been dancing/sweating all night and come home and take a hot shower while you are dehydrated. This would not be smart. You&#039;ll probly end up fine, maybe only get a bit of dizziness, but there is still risk involved.
