				As the title states, I have received some white &#039;paste&#039; that is called meth/speed/pep and sold by several vendors here.&nbsp; The problem is, I have absolutely no idea what to do with it.&nbsp; I carved out about 75mg of it and parachuted it on an empty stomach, and...&nbsp; Well, it made me feel a little bit sociable I guess.&nbsp; The thing is, I can read about meth on the forums out there all day long, and no-one talks about paste.&nbsp; People are smoking meth, snorting meth, shooting meth, etc, etc, but there is not one word &#039;out there&#039; about what to do with meth in paste form.&nbsp; <br /><br />My next step would be to eat a lot more (like 200mg) or try stuffing 125mg up my bum or something.&nbsp; What is the alternative, dry it right out in a little dish under a light bulb and snort it?&nbsp; I guess I really don&#039;t know what this paste is, there are several different kinds of meth and going by erowid dosages for threshhold, etc, don&#039;t seem to work with this stuff.<br /><br />You guys out there that are buying it, what are you doing with it?

				You can &quot;bomb&quot; the paste (wrap in a rizla and swallow), or dab it on your gums, or even mix it with water and bumsquirt it (never tried that one).<br /><br />I recently took a batch out of about a year&#039;s storage, and the paste had turned itself into a nice powder over time.<br />You can let yours dry out a bit, e.g. over a radiator, in an oven at low power, &amp;c.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take long...<br />Then do what you want with it...&nbsp; Sniff it, swallow it, bum it, &amp;c &amp;c.<br /><br />My batch, from a nameless dutch vendor, has been finding its way into my veins via the sharp and pointy route, but this is NOT recommended, and should be attempted with extreme caution, or better still not at all!! :(<br /><br /><br />Be safe and enjoy ur paste :)

				Get yourself a glass dish like a caserole dish. Empty the &quot;Paste&quot; out onto that, and proceed to use a razor blade or similar to cut the paste into fine pieces (same way ud start cutting up for snorting lines). You will notice it will start becoming powdery within no time.&nbsp; Its more of a putty than a paste (the stuff I got anyway). After cutting it up with a blade in the same manner I would prepare actual lines, id leave it thinly dispersed over the glass top for about 15 minutes. Come back and repeat, cut it up finer and finer, then spread it VERY thin all over the glass top, then leave another 15 minutes. Do this for n hr or two and ul have powder to snort. DO NOT USE A HEAT SOURCE TO DRY IT. You will lose potency, and it literally takes n hr or two to air dry, and its good to go....

				Hey man<br /><br />What I did was I took a ceramic plate. Placed it in the microwave on high for about a minute. I then placed a small amount of the paste on the hot plate. I took a credit card or ID or what ever you want to use and I completely flattened the paste with the card, allowing it to dry out a bit on the hot plate. Then just scrap it up and chop chop chop!!! Make some lines and insufflate them. Worked fine for me... I also found leaving the bag filled with the paste open for a few days, dried it out perfectly.

				dont heat it above 60-70° C ! <br />I usually smear it onto a small mirror / glas with a card and put it in an oven by 50° or on a heater.<br />Then chop &amp; snort it :P

				You can also put your paste in a tube of vitamins or aspirin empty. There must have the desiccant in the cap. Your paste is dry in two or three hours without being heated, and without being damaged.

				don&#039;t know if this is really on topic, as I hear you talking about meth-paste...<br />but I have some (regular, couldn&#039;t possibly be meth for the price) speed paste, and I was planning on just eating some of it... starting low (like 250mg) working my way up. <br />Is this a good idea?

				250 mg in one oral dose is not starting low.&nbsp; <br /><br />65 mg of dried speed paste (the kind from Germany sold on SR, good quality d-amphetamine), is quite a decent dose for me, and I&#039;m not a small guy.&nbsp; 85 mg is at the high end of a dose for me.<br /><br />When wet, a lot of the weight is solvent/water, so dosages will be higher if you swallow it wet, lower if dry.&nbsp;

				I would bomb it in a cigarette paper - i assume this is what you mean by parachuting it.<br /><br />occasionally I would chop it and snort it, ugh......<br /><br />I have had friends who would wash it, etc - mainly guys who would inject it, though I have eaten or snorted the washed phet (I have never jacked it up) and i can&#039;t say I noticed too much difference.<br /><br />as for dosage, or more accurately weight (as you don&#039;t know how pure it is)......<br /><br />Only way to know is to give it a try - so start low and work up<br /><br />Oh, It also works ok in a coffee or tea....

				So, what is the point of drying it out in the first place?&nbsp; For insufflation purposes?&nbsp; &nbsp;Say if you just wanted to bomb it, what would be wrong with bombing it without dryting it out first, other than using a higher doseage?

				If you store it at room temp, it&#039;s going to dry out on its own pretty quickly, a few days or so.&nbsp; Or at least that&#039;s my experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />The stuff I got, while decent quality, still had some organic solvent still in it.&nbsp; So, for me, I prefer not to swallow the solvent.&nbsp; I guess a little probably wouldn&#039;t hurt you, tho.
