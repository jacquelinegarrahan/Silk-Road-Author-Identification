				Hey guys.<br /><br />First off, I&#039;m not very big into cocaine. I&#039;ll only buy extremely high quality stuff once in a blue moon. I do have some coke coming from Bungee, and told some friends IRL about it. One friend said that I could make a killing selling to their friends if the quality is good. That got me thinking: How could I resell this very expensive cocaine, make it semi-affordable, keep a lot of the quality, and still make a profit? The obvious answer is to cut it. What&#039;s not so obvious to me is how to cut it, and how to make it presentable for the buyer. I have no knowledge on cut %&#039;s, what&#039;s safest to cut with, or really anything related to the coke game. I sold MDMA for a few years, but got out once I graduated college. <br /><br />Anyone have experience with cocaine sales or distribution? I&#039;m guessing I could cut this particular 97.8% pure cocaine by 2.5 and still have it remain &quot;fishscale&quot; quality. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks.

				cutting drugs is generally frowned upon.. I&#039;m not here to give you a whole moral lesson so I&#039;m just gonna cut to the chase.. I highly doubt anybody is giving you 98% cocaine anywhere on this site or anywhere in the world, (Columbia included).&nbsp; Pure 100 % Cocaine hcl is hygroscopic, which means that it pulls moisture out of the air and will turn to a watery mush if its not left in an airtight container. So right off the bat, the manufacturers of cocaine cut it with some cutting agents to prevent this from happening, thus almost all cocaine in the world, no matter where you get it from is automatically cut already with enough powder to prevent it from turning to mush. <br />As for finding cutting agents, I would not recommend using advice from some stranger online, because (besides for cutting being a dick thing to do) if you screw up and use the wrong measurements you might lose alot of drugs and really be fucked.<br />But if you insist on using info you found online, try using google and see what pops up

				According to the independent lab test thread for cocaine, this particular cocaine was converted to a base, and came up as 87% cocaine out of a possible 89% with no active cuts. I&#039;m also aware that cutting is a &quot;dick thing to do&quot;, and to be honest, I hate cut cocaine, and actively seek out shit that isn&#039;t cut. However, @ $1700 for 15g, I would absolutely have to cut it if I were to meet price expectations in real life while pulling in a profit. No one is going to pay 220/g, and selling for anything less that would yield a profit so small that it wouldn&#039;t even be worth it. And yes, I could google this question and get countless bluelight threads of actual retards who think they know what they&#039;re talking about. Or, I could ask the same question in a forum of experienced drug users, and experienced drug vendors who might have some useful information. <br /><br />The coke i&#039;m getting shipped is for personal use and i&#039;m not selling it. This is more of a thought experiment to see whether or not it&#039;d be feasible and profitable to buy this very pure cocaine and re-sell it. Thanks for the response.

				Yeah I understand both sides. Customers dont like cut cocaine but at the same time they cant afford pure cocaine so dealers have to cut it so that the cocaine will be affordable (and make more sales). I personally dont have a problem with ppl cutiing drugs.. hey if ppl like your drugs (that are cut) and are willing to pay the prices you charge, theyll come back to you for more. If not, they should go find a better dealer. It&#039;s all a game of supply and demand and unfortunately there is a demand for cheap cocaine. <br />That being said I hope you find someone who can help you, but i would suggest having someone PM you the info as opposed to posting out in the open. You dont want some immature teenagers or whoever seeing the methods/cuts. Some people are real scumbags and if they can figure out how to cut up cocaine that is already only 40% pure, then we&#039;re gona have even shittier coke going around somehwere and i feel kinda bad for those customers who just want a bag of coke to relax and end up sniffing a bag of levamisole mixed with lidocaine (hey would you like some cocaine with your levasimole :P) <br />

				don&#039;t cut it, charge them more or just do smaller deals - real decent coke i only need 0.3 of a gram to last me the whole night, cut rubbish i can get through an eighth. it&#039;s a lot easier on the nose if you don&#039;t cut it, you don&#039;t wake up with the colombian flu the next morning

				Like other people have said, You can just make smaller deals so you can sell for a reasonable price still (By cutting it your just giving impression of more coke but removing affect, maybe explain this to your customers)<br /><br />If you absolutely must cut it to sell it I would also suggest that coke that has been cut with glucose be the best and you would also require a press to re-rock it. You can get a cheap manual press for doing small amounts but when you are cutting the coke you need to make sure you evenly distribute each powder before you press or you will end up with patches of good coke and patches of bad coke!!

				Thanks for the input, guys. If I had it my way, I&#039;d just re-sell what I get as is with the high purity. The fact of the matter is that people who I know would rather &quot;snort more shit&quot; than snort purer coke if it means a lower price. This is not how I feel, which is why i choose to purchase through SR and go for insane quality. I&#039;d be willing to give people small bumps so they can tell they don&#039;t need to do as much to get the effect. And this is all a hypothetical situation anyway. Not that interested in the street coke game. I&#039;d rather sell psyches or mdma haha.

If you&#039;re gunna cut it at the minimum of 70% then you aren&#039;t going to yield enough to make it even worth cutting. Just my opinion.

				^ I agree. After thinking about it, I&#039;d probably only sell half g&#039;s for around 100. Seems way too pricey to get people to buy it, but maybe the quality will change people&#039;s minds. Cocaine is definitely only really profitable if you get it direct from the source. This is more of a pipedream than anything.
