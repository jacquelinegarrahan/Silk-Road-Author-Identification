				So my girlfriend is about to start being drug tested next month. She has stopped smoking with me and we are going to take MDMA tomarow and sometime next week. after that We are going to stop.&nbsp; I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on a drug that does not show up on a drug test. Me and my Girlfriend are not very picky on drugs so any suggestions would be great.&nbsp; It seems like every idea i have shows a false positive for something else.

				Depends what kind of drug test. Usually its a 5 panel and it will test for Marijuana, Amphetamines/Meth, Cocaine, Opiates, Barbiturates/Benzos.<br /><br />MDMA is excreted 3-5 days after using.

LSD, Mushrooms, 2c-x&#039;s do not come out on drug tests unless specifically tested for. It depends what you want but a quick search on the net will reveal if it will or not.

				yeah ive looked. lsd is a little long lasting for some reason i trip for like 14 hours and i cant funtion the next day but i do love mushies. 2c family does have a little hiccup. thier are studies done that it can metabolize into a molecule that can give a false positive for amphetamines. for a while I thought that would be something good for us to have but i did a ton of research on it and a lot is inconclusive. so it scares me a little bit. me and her do love 2cb. we will probably get some mushies they are just a little pricy for one trip

				yes ive taken LSD 3 times and two was the same batch and then one was different. im positive the single tab was lsd because i recieved it from the road and the trip was almost identical to the first two. everytime it just effects me really wierd like my friends will all be fine and like ready to go to sleep and ill be over there with full blown like crazy patterns taking up my whole visual plane thinkig im dying. i just dont take LSD anymore its not my thing. I do fine with 25i,2cb,mushrooms,25b,amt,mda but lsd just makes me go crazy and freak out for like 12+ hours&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been looking into candy flipping though ive thought that may help me. if i ever decide to explore LSD again ill probly combine it with mdma for shure.

				If i&#039;m not mistaken, GHB cannot be tested for with a standard 5 panel test. If you&#039;ve never had it, its similar to alcohol, but in my opinion, more enjoyable, euphoric and less dizzy/spinny.<br />

				<br />LSD &amp; psilocin are extremely difficult to test for. <br /><br />Fentanyl will not show up on standard urine test, as it&#039;s metabolized differently than most other opiates. They&#039;d need to order a specific test for it &amp; so unless she starts showing up high she&#039;d have nothing to worry about. <br /><br />otoh if she starts dabbling in fentanyl there&#039;s a good chance she&#039;ll lose the job for other reasons. <br /><br /><br />GHB might be a good one. It&#039;s rarely tested for &amp; is metabolized rapidly &amp; if for some reason it does show up she can always claim to have been roofied at a bar or something. Synthetic cannabinoids (the JHW series, cannabicyclohexanol) won&#039;t show up on a standard five panel either. <br /><br /><br />

				If you like it, DMT will not show in any normal drug test because you need a specific one since DMT is anyway always present in the organism.<br /><br />If you never tried it, I bet this is the good time to try. It&#039;s also a short lasting psychedelic so it&#039;s not that you are 12 hours at a time inside a trip; you can use DMT without problems daily for a period of time.<br /><br />Alternatively also other psychedelics don&#039;t usually get screened, they need other type of tests.

				If it&#039;s an important intership and everything why don&#039;t you let her sober up a little bit instead of having MD twice in a week and possibly something else? Just thinking. ;)<br />
