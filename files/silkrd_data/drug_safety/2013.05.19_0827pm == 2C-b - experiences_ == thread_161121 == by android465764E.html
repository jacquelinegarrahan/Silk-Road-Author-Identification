				What are your experiences with 2C-B? <br />I&#039;m gonna give it a try this week but I&#039;d like to know what people think of it&#039;s affects?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read on erowid how 2C-B is like; <br />&quot;a cross between the effects of LSD and MDMA, but nothing like a combination of the two.&quot; <br /><br />Can anyone elaborate on this? (ÅŒ_o) <br /><br />Also, what are the visuals like?<br /><br />Tbh I find most of the erowid experience reports to be highly suspect. I&#039;d rather hear from some people here who have actually tried 2C-B.&nbsp;

				2C-B gives an MDMA like euphoric rush. The first time I tried 2C-B I got this sudden rush that coursed through my body. I started playing music very loudly and I danced around the house and shook dat money maker. It was awesome, I felt so carefree. Really euphoric, but not to the extent of mdma... MDMA&#039;s euphoria is far beyond it but in a different way. <br /><br />The visuals, from what I&#039;ve seen myself, are a lot like LSD but still are in their own domain. There were things I saw that I&#039;ve seen on LSD... what look like large wheels spinning like a spinning wheel (from a loom? Not sure, I think it&#039;s just called a spinning wheel) along with awesome tracers, textures rising from the ground etc. Some visuals are hard to explain, but 2C-B isn&#039;t like some of the other 2Cs where the visuals kind of just overlay your vision, this literally starts to manipulate it. <br /><br />I remember I was looking at my computer monitor and I don&#039;t know how this is possible but it seemed like the font on my screen LOST DEPTH, my font just turned all pixely and while this isn&#039;t really that amazing I was baffled at how this was even happening. <br /><br />Funny stuff. <br /><br />By the way, this was on 18mg and just the tiniest bit of pot. Not even good pot, shitty brick weed. Later though, I did smoke good pot and I started to panic a little bit, but that&#039;s because I get panic attacks from weed. <br />

				I&#039;m going to be trying 2C-B for the first time in the summer, quite excited for it :)<br /><br />There&#039;s quite an extensive thread about 2C-B:<br /><br />The 2CB Thread - Dosing and Experience<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106130.0

				2C-B was the first psychedelic I ever tried, and my first time was very mild. I don&#039;t remember from whom I purchased it from, but it honestly wasn&#039;t very good compared the my other, more recent experiences with the drug. The first time I stayed up all night talking to a friend of mine, I had very subtle hallucinations and an all-around good feeling. But a few months ago I received some 2C-B from a good friend of mine. The first time I tried some, I swallowed about 10mg and snorted 10mg (VERY PAINFUL FYI), the second time I swallowed about 30mg and both times I tripped. HARD.<br /><br />Each trip started with some intense hallucinations of colors and patterns accompanied by occasional laughter. The rest was basically sensory overload, as well as racing thoughts that seemed to constantly loop. I felt an uncomfortable nervous feeling in my gut for most of the time, but I also felt really good. It was different from mushrooms, I like to do mushrooms and then gather my thoughts and have a fun time, but with 2C-B I have found that gathering my thoughts is impossible. I felt overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time, like I was expecting more to be happening but I didn&#039;t want it to. I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s hard to explain, but I remember thinking the same thoughts over and over and over and over, and I KNEW I was stuck in a loop, but I couldn&#039;t think anything else.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to try this drug I recommend doing it with a friend who also does drugs, even better if they&#039;ve done 2C-B before.

				In the book of Pihkal is written how to make 2c-b.<br /><br />On erowid experiences can be shared withe others. Combinations with 2c-b -mdma- and weed for example.<br /><br />You should use very little 2c-b compared to the amount of xtc.<br /><br />2c-b is one of the easyest ways to make drugs in the book of Pihkal.<br />For DMT you need a little more then e kitchen although it can be done,<br /><br /><br />Erowid and Pihkal, follow instructions step by step.

				2c-b is crazy at high doses I think, the visual stuff was so extreme when I took something like 40 mg<br />The visuals everything was breathing wildly....I was glad I was at home!<br /><br />When I had a little pill of it, I think about 20 mg it was a little bit euphoric with some light visuals.<br /><br />a next time I would definitely dose low<br /><br />So how was your experience?

				Well, I tried it. 30mg rizla bomb on an empty stomach. <br /><br />Ooooooh yes. Where has this been all my life?! <br /><br />Mild euphoria, not dissimilar to mdma, and some crazy visuals. Melting, breathing, strong OEVs and insane CEVs. <br /><br />I did experience some crippling anxiety just before the peak, I honestly thought I was gonna have some serious issues, but after a small spliff that went away.<br /><br />The duration wasn&#039;t very long, but this was ideal really. I rarely have the time anymore to enjoy a full psychedelic trip. 2C-b seems like a happy medium.<br /><br />Will definitely be getting some more of this.

				Tried it for my 3rd time this weekend. took about 20 mg along with about 4 bourbon and tonics...absolutely amazing. The alcohol makes it feel like your own the verge of an extreme mdma roll, but you never quite reach it, and instead you get stuck in a happy pyschedelhic trance. It really felt like mollys weird cousin that brings you to all the weird places for fun instead of the usual main attractions.

				My experience has been that of heavy visuals and a general feeling of contentness and happyness. But lacking the soul of LSD.
