				There is really no point in IV Xanax or Valium. The BA is about the same for oral and IV. Also, Xanax is not soluble in water (I&#039;m almost certain), so you will not be able to crush and disolve the pills or even the pure powder. The only advantage would be a faster onset of effects, and Xanax is really fast enough orally. It only takes about 15 minutes for it to hit me.<br />I looked into this once myself a few years ago.

				I am not sure about xanax, but if chemical is fatsoluble - propylene glycol can be used as solvent.<br /><br />For this - I am sure. <br /><br />1. Tried it on myself.<br />2. They use this technique in hospitals, dissolving benzos with PG, for fast working tranquilizer to patient.<br /><br />Liquid phenazepam, benzorc, is also actually phenazepam dissolved in PG.<br /><br />PG can be obtained from local pharmacy, if they ask what for - selfmade cosmetics.. or aromas.. or electronic cigarette..<br /><br />Or it can be obtained from ebay.<br /><br />And be warned - this is just knowledge. Consider well, before putting it to use.

				All kidding aside, it is possible to push a number of benzo&#039;s IV if required, including good old valium.<br /><br />Given the fast onset of action there would be no reason to do this yourself though, things like xanax start to take effect within 20 minutes or so when taken orally. In a hospital setting benzo&#039;s might be given IV, but that is mostly the case if the patient is not able to take them orally. There simply would be no sense in taking benzo&#039;s IV unless there was already an IV bag running into the patient, and/or the patient is no longer capable of swallowing something. <br /><br />Practically benzo&#039;s are not given IV unless the patient is in acute danger and oral administration isn&#039;t feasible anymore. This can occasionally happen in first aid cases where it is administered in an ambulance on the way to hospital, but its very uncommon. In cases where the patient turns violent other substances such as haloperidol are preferable.

				Alprazolam (xanax) has the highest bioavailability when ingested far more so then any ROA actually (except buccal, i&#039;m not sure of it&#039;s bioavailability via this route) far greater then insufflation and unquestionably greater then IVing because it&#039;s lipophilic and it&#039;s absorption is done in the gut.<br /><br />RedFlag, to dissolve alprazolam requires a non-polar solvent, that&#039;s all.&nbsp; Clinical injectables use propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol (PEG) to suspend a lipophilic benzodiazepine.<br /><br />In a clinical/hospital environment typically the only two&nbsp; benzos ever used are&nbsp; lorazepam (Ativan) and diazepam (Valium) because they;re short acting and have all 6 intrinsic benzo effects (sedative, anticonvusant, anxioytic, amnesic, antiemetic and muscle relaxant).<br /><br />They are by no means a desired treatment by clinicians, but are extremely effective at terminating !!ACUTE!! seizures and treating violent or agitated (eg. on drugs) people admitted to an ER.&nbsp; You&#039;ll never see them used in a chronic setting, only ACUTE where the benefit&#039;s outweigh the say ... effects of an acute grand mal seizure !<br /><br />Administering IV for recreation definitely will have no benefits over oral as it&#039;s IV use is to put an abrupt end to someone&#039;s night lol.<br /><br />Eat it and be happy :)

				I&#039;d dispute the latter, really.<br /><br />The onset after injection will be must faster compared to ingestion, no problem there. IV bypasses the intestines liver compared to ingesting on the first run, which will reduce the time of onset from the order of an hour to minutes.&nbsp; But after that it is metabolized by the liver and will take an equal number of additional passes to clear regardless of how it was originally administered.<br /><br />I suppose the terminology &quot;short acting&quot; is the problem - it would better be described as &quot;rapid onset&quot;, since that does not imply the activity will span a short period of time after administration. Perhaps this seems like word play, but if someone suggests to me that a substance is &quot;short acting&quot; i&#039;d assume that its effects will not last for a very long time, rather then that they kick in rapidly per se.

				didnt read all of this, but I tried it myself also.<br />Got some powder, dissolved it in a soution, IT IS NOT WATER SOLUBLE, <br />I IVed , fuck cant recall how much, didnt feel a damn thing bro.<br />Dont bother.<br />The only benzo&#039;s you will feel are diaz. solution IM,<br />&nbsp;midaz. IM(but hardly worth it),<br />&nbsp;midazIV, can be fucking dangerous .<br />i&#039;ve tried it all mate(well most) not every bennie is availaable here., the only thing that worked was temazeapam solution IV, <br />which is history im sorry to say.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;EDIT: DO NOT USE SALIVA!&nbsp; Ideally, PPG/PEG as previous posters have stated.&nbsp; Ascorbate might help increase solubility, but you&#039;re going to have to go out on a limb with this one.&nbsp; I have also wondered about IV Xan, but I won&#039;t do it, because I don&#039;t shoot anything I don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have ethanolic PPG which I bought as a pharmaceutical flavoring agent, which I&#039;m sure would work, not sure about the PPG% on it, so it seems&nbsp; a bit messy tho.&nbsp; Realistically,&nbsp; your best bet would be to get a Vial of something IV-ready and also lipophilic, like Ativan(80%PPG) injection, and use that to dissolve your Alprazolam.&nbsp; &nbsp;Before you do, though, try IVing Ambien with a cold-shake double-filter.&nbsp; &nbsp;After you use a spatula to pull your ass off of the floor, (joking) you will have an idea of why you don&#039;t want to inject Xanax.

				I suppose many IV users actually use blood as the solvent, mixing a few ml of their own blood with their drug of choice before injecting the whole bunch back into their system. I suppose this is common practice with heroin and such, but there is no reason to assume in will not work with other substances that are somewhat soluble in water. <br /><br />Benzo&#039;s arent generally that soluble in water or blood though, so i&#039;d suggest using ethanol if you must get it dissolved for some reason, and simply ingesting the tablets if that reason is getting yourself a dose.

				you &quot;suppose&quot;&nbsp; - seriously? have you ever shot up? i think you should probably do some research first before making comments like that. <br /><br />maybe i am wrong but that sounds not only revolting but incredibly dangerous. maybe i am just not aware and i am the one who is wrong potentially (it wouldnt be the first time lol) but can you provide even one source or account for you statement?&nbsp; <br /><br />i have done tons of researching into IV methods being an occasional user of that ROA myself and have never once seen a single mention of anyone using their own blood. this would incredibly dangerous given how fast blood clots, even just in a syringe after registering if you miss let alone pure blood being used to cook up and then re-injected? if you have no sound backing for your comment, you need to have hard evidence before spreading misinformation that could potentially harm others

				Wow, addicts using blood and spit to jack up- what next spunk? Hows about this- I had to frig my girlfriend off for 30 mins until I had enough juice to cook up in! lol. What a load of bollocks (pardon my French).&nbsp; Urban myths rule OK!!<br />I think the blood thing comes from some people who after injecting the actual drug, draw back a load of blood into the syringe and then squeeze it back into their arm (without withdrawing the syringe in between), sort of rinsing the syringe, when you&#039;re feeling the hit come on it&#039;s sort of playing, part of the needle fetish. Addicts in a public toilet, stuck for water might flush the toilet and collect some of the water that is flushing (I am guilty of that myself) Gross as it might sound, it is clean water and it is going to be boiled ( just make sure there isn&#039;t a toilet bleach block in the cistern). When you&#039;re clucking, it is a matter of make do just to take the misery away, but spit, no, I&#039;ve not heard of that one in 24 years of H (clean now, thank fuck) and seriously doubt it, you couldn’t cook it, it would turn into a nasty gooey mess for one. Urban myth says I.

				MAN NO WITH THE SALIVA I CANT EXPRESS THIS ENOUGH. <br />Even when you put the tip of the needle in your mouth, pull it out &amp; think you&#039;re cleaning it MAN YOU KNOW HOW MAN BACTERIA/GERM/POTENTIAL VIRUS YOU&#039;RE PUTTING DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM. <br />Have you ever had a dirty shot when you spew every twenty minutes, you lay in bed for 2 days with a fucking THROBBING migraine, that can result from just a tad of saliva on your needle tip man.<br />I mentioned I used a solution earlier, although I told you that xanax does not effect you in any way IV, in no way did I mention saliva, If you insist on doing it, alpraz will dissolve in grain alcohol/ethanol 95%, but it burns a bit. So as suggested by other posters, as like I used, propylene glycol, it&#039;s cheap, I still use it. But in a dropper orally, Trust me under the tongue, or swallow it doesnt have to break up like a tablet, it works in 5 minutes, I tried shooting it and got absolutely nothing,<br />Good Luck<br />HM
