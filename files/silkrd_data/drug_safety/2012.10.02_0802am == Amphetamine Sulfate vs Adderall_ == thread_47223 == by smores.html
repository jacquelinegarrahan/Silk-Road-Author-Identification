				I had the same idea but have yet to test it out. Amphetamine sulfate includes two &quot;stereoisomers&quot; of the amphetamine molecule. Stereoisomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, just like your hands. Adderall includes 75% of the right (dextro) isomer and 25% of the left (levro) isomer. Amphetamine sulfate, I presume, is 50% of each. From what I can gather, the left isomer provides a bit more of a body speediness, whereas the right isomer provides a cerebral speediness. So, my guess is that amphetamine sulfate will affect the body a bit more. It will probably also hit harder because, unlike adderal, none of the amphetamine is in any kind of extended release form. If you take it after eating, it might create a de facto extended release and thus feel more like adderal.

				I was thinking exactly the same thing. Why don&#039;t you give it a try and come back and report on it? You probably wouldn&#039;t need a full 30mg at first, unless you want to be sped up. I&#039;d do it but I need to be clean for the next few months so I won&#039;t be trying it any time soon. Some people use low doses of meth for this purpose, so I can see why amphetamine would be better.

				I was also interested in seeing the outcome. The money saved (gram by gram) if light dosages of amphetamines could be used as a study aid would be tremendous.<br />Hell, if nobody gives it a go in a couple weeks I&#039;ll place an order and give it a shot<br /><br />-schmuck

Amphetamine paste aka &quot;base&quot; is usually lower in purity (typical 50% amphetamine/50% glucose and water or &quot;insert solvent here&quot;). I&#039;m not saying it is bad stuff, however I would stick with good ol Amphetamine Sulfate if at all possible. Consuming a solvent-free product is in many ways preferable to consuming fresh paste and allows one to not trash the nose too much, not to mention all the other bad side-effects of snorting, smoking or ingesting solvents.<br /><br />EDIT: For some reason I went off on Amphetamine Paste, I think bc I was agreeing with @JoeyGPesci007 <br />

				Today I tried amphetamine sulfate as a replacement for dexedrine. I kept the dose low and took it orally since I&#039;m new to the powder. It seemed to work pretty well. My impression is that it is a feasible alternative to dexedrine and adderall. My powder came from LetGoOfYourEgo.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say whether it&#039;s strong or average but it&#039;s legit and looks pure and white.&nbsp;

				LetGoOfYourEgo&#039;s stuff is pretty good. It gets the job done for the price. I had to rack about a 100mg line but, doesn&#039;t burn too bad. <br /><br />This is kinda how i describe it. <br /><br />I did achieve some euphoria, but it was very short lived. It kinda reminds me of adderall you know?&nbsp; Very subtle, it&#039;s hard to describe. It wasn&#039;t a rushing euphoria, or in a sense a rush. More, of a relaxed, concentrated, mild euphoria. I&#039;m&nbsp; glad it didn&#039;t hit like ritilian. (I know you can&#039;t really compare ritilian to amph, but i hope you can understand what i mean. Where the buzz is more Super concentrated, jittery mess.) The comedown was pretty easy and has a nice drop off. I didn&#039;t get that horriable headache that i get when i come off addys.

				LittleK is exactly right here. Some great information coming from a newbie. Adderall is 75% d-amphet and 25%l-amphet. The d-amphet is more potent molecule; the fun version, giving that dopamine kick. The l-molecule still gets you high, but probably contributes more of the &#039;body buzz&#039;.<br /><br />The main difference that you&#039;re going to run into is that street amphetamine is generally of inconsistent or poor quality. Oftentimes it&#039;s cut with caffeine, and other substances. Adderall is made in a big fancy pharma lab, and is both very consistent and very pure. It also happens to be fuckin-a expensive on the road. So expensive, in fact, that getting high is almost too expensive, and having a habit is untenable.<br /><br />Right now on SR though, there are two vendors selling VERY high quality amphet. BoyMaster and CapeCrusader both have great reviews in the forums, and with the per-gram price, you can afford to stay nice and speeded-up without breaking the bank. I know you already made your purchase, so let us know what you think when it shows up.

				I ended up deciding that LetGoOfYourEgo&#039;s powder isn&#039;t strong enough and doesn&#039;t last long enough to serve as a practical replacement for adderall or dexedrine. I&#039;ve ordered some powder from BoyMaster that is supposed to be over 90% pure amphetamine. Will update when it comes in.
