				Hello, Just had my first experience with Oxycontin and was quite pleased.&nbsp; I have a bit of a natural tolerance and at one point had quite a big tolerance (to me it was) of nearly 900mg of tramadol. My last line of my oc 40 though I got a little panicked as it hit quite hard and I did the 40 within 3 hours before the line I had little euphoria but thought that the oc could have still built up in my system so I got a little worried and decided to go for a short walk as I thought if I was alright after it peaked around 30 minutes I would be fine.<br /><br />So on to my questions, how much oc could i safely take without causing problems (not that I intend to go near that dose) just to avoid panic next time so i can enjoy my high better.<br /><br />How long after a line is it safe to assume that I haven&#039;t overdosed?<br /><br />and what are the first symptons I would notice and best things to do?<br /><br />Think i&#039;ll eat it next time anyway as the high was very short lived, thanks in advance for any answers or advice.<br /><br />another few questions about opiates in general, how does the euphoria from morphine compare to that of heroin and how about opium? I liked tramadol because it lasted a long time for me, how long does opium last?

				It is pretty hard to OD, you could do 40mg in one line and be fine, you might feel sick if you have little tolerance but you are defiantly not going to die. I know people who have done 200mg+ with no tolerance, they felt like shit but they didn&#039;t die. Be safe, but don&#039;t stress.

				There is no hard and fast rule because people metabolize the drug differently and thus have different natural tolerances. Check out this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6<br /><br />Based on how your CYP2D6 enzyme expresses itself, you could be like the poster above me and need 40 mg just to feel oxy with no tolerance, or you could be like most people and only need 7.5-10 mg to get pretty high with no tolerance. If you&#039;re one of the first type of people, I don&#039;t really have any guidelines for you because I fall into the second category--a 60 mg line with no tolerance would probably cause me to OD. On the other hand, if I&#039;ve been using oxy heavily for a few months straight, I could easily use that much without any problems.<br /><br />The best thing you can do is educate yourself about both oxy and your body and be cautious. Oxy has a 3-4.5 hour halflife, so take your dose and wait at least that long before taking more--bearing in mind that half of it is still in your system at that point. In fact, to avoid addiction you&#039;d be better off not dosing more than once in a day, and ideally not more than once in a week since daily use will eventually lead to physical dependence where you require it every few hours. If 40 mg felt good, stick to that as your starting point and don&#039;t take more than 5 mg more than that the first time if you decide to take a higher dose. <br /><br />There was a vendor before the seizure who was selling injectable naloxone for treating overdoses, for people to have on hand just in case. Maybe someone on BMR or Sheep will have this and you can pick some up. The thing is, someone else would have to use it on you. If you take enough to OD, you won&#039;t be conscious. If you&#039;re conscious and think you&#039;re &quot;ODing,&quot; you&#039;re not. You can even be nodding pretty hard (in and out of consciousness), and that&#039;s still not an OD.&nbsp; It becomes an issue when you turn blue and aren&#039;t breathing enough, and nobody can wake you up.<br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t be more helpful. Good luck and be careful.

				I overdosed on oxy once. My symptoms were: shortness of breath, which was quite severe. Wheezing noises from chest. Tinnitus noises in the ears. Blurry vision, which increased to become a total temporary blindness. Slurred speech, which progressed to inability to speak at all. Dizziness.. Unable to stand on my feet. <br /><br />In general, with all my opiate OD&#039;s, the common effect was the itch all over the body.<br />other common effects were the SOB, and the difficulty swallowing. <br /><br />I was given Diazepam in the ER. So always keep those pills handy. <br /><br /><br />** I forgot to say that my method of administration was swallowing. The effects were noted an hour later.

				Diazepam would kill you if you were overdosing on opiates. Don&#039;t listen to this guy.

				Hey, I&#039;m not trying to get anyone killed!<br />I always hear that benzos make the effect of opiates stronger.<br />But I&#039;m pretty sure that I was given this in the ER! It is also written on my discharge report.<br /><br />Anyways.. I&#039;ll take this back. No dramaz!

				CodoneCowboy is spot on with his opiate od advice<br /><br />I&#039;d just like to advise again NOT to use a benzo if you&#039;re <br />having problems breathing/overdosing on opiates<br /><br />This is a lethal combo to the opiate naive <br /><br />+1 to CodoneCowboy
