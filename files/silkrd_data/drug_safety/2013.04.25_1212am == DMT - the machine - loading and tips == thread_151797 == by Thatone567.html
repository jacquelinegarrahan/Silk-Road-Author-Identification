				So I&#039;ve ordered freebase DMT and am in the process of making &quot;the machine&quot; - all I need now is to get a glass drill bit and drill a hole - and once I do I&#039;ll be ready to smoke it.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering how I should load it into the bottle exactly? I&#039;m assuming I&#039;d just gather up the proper amount (probably 10 mg for my first time to be careful) and push it into the straw I&#039;ll have inserted in the hole made by the drill at the bottom of the bottle (so the top of the &#039;machine&#039;) so that it falls onto the copper mesh, and then it&#039;ll be ready for melting/vaping. Is this accurate?<br /><br />Also, is there any advice someone can give me for safety regarding my first trip? I know to be careful with not burning myself/my surroundings, and know to be in a decent state of mind for the trip.

				You should load from the top. Apply heat to the neck of the bottle to slowly heat up the steel wool and melt the DMT into the steel wool. You can then place the cap on top to store it for future use if need be.<br /><br />To hit it just flip it upside down, remove the cap, and begin apply heat below the wool while inhaling. <br /><br />Here&#039;s an infographic for you:<br /><br />Clearnet warning:<br /><br />http://mycotopia[DOT]net/forums/attachments/botanicals-cactus-misc-entheogens-psychedelics/67822d1195320961-dmt-pipe-83484machine.jpg

				So there isn&#039;t a very likely chance of the DMT liquid dripping from the wool onto the floor? I don&#039;t have a cap for mine at the moment (got the bottle from a friend) but if it&#039;s helpful for protecting the DMT remains in the wool after my trip I should be able to use any old bottle cap.

				I wouldn&#039;t mind some photos or video of somebody actually using the machine.

				I don&#039;t think you should use a straw at all on the machine.&nbsp; It&#039;s best to leave the bottle just how it is, like in that document that v01d posted.<br /><br />It&#039;s just like he said, once you&#039;ve made the machine, hold the bottle upright and drop your weighed-out product on top of the mesh, heat up the side of the bottleneck while rotating it until the powder melts into the mesh.&nbsp; once it melts in, it will never drip out, dont worry... unless for some reason you&#039;re adding waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much, like a few grams or more. anyway once it&#039;s melted in you just flip it upside down, light your bic and place it so that the flame just touches the metal mesh.&nbsp; then inhale as much as you can as many times as you can.&nbsp; 10mg will probably just be one hit.. that may make you feel wobbly, but you won&#039;t get a breakthrough.&nbsp; later you&#039;ll want to try to get as many hits in before you have to set the machine down.
