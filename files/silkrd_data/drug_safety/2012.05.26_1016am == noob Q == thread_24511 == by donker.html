				I suggest eating MDMA, you can sniff it but it fucks your nose up very quickly and it burns like hell<br /><br />One hit per person is pretty acceptable dose for most LSD, although once you get experience you may find that you prefer taking two or even five or ten hits. Some people prefer taking half a hit even, but I think one is a great starting dose for your first time, provided it is close to average dose (~100-200 ug).

				Weigh out 160mgs of molly, wrap in tissue or a rizla paper and bomb it. 160mg is the best starting dose IMO. You should feel it within 30 mins and it should peak after an hour. Once you&#039;ve hit the peak take another 40-60mgs, it is said that it extends the duration of the peak... However anything over 250mgs of molly in total is a waste of drugs... Once the peak is over taking more and more molly won&#039;t bring you back to the peak (I&#039;ve made this mistake and many others have) It&#039;s hard not to try and chase that initial peak lol.<br /><br />Some people snort Molly... IMO it&#039;s better to take it orally. Last time I snorted molly I vomited from the drip. Stings a lot as well!<br /><br />For the LSD, I&#039;d start of with one blotter... you can normally feel it within 45mins... sometimes it can take 90 mins. For your first time just do one blotter, if all goes well you can take more the next time.<br /><br />Hope this has cleared things up and happy silk roading&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />Sollemnis

				Sollemnis covered it pretty well, but in case you haven&#039;t figure it out a blotter is a small square tab of paper with LSD soaked into it. You can leave it on your tongue for a bit, chew it up and then swallow it. It doesn&#039;t really matter what you do so long as you swallow it. You can take one tab for your first time just to ease into it, but once you&#039;re comfortable with the experience you can take pretty much as many tabs as you want because I doubt you&#039;ll have enough to overdose on. Most tabs are dosed at about 100Âµg which is fun, but that&#039;s nothing compared to eating a ten-strip which I advise you to do at some point in your life. Hell...if you ever get the chance eat an entire sheet! ;D<br /><br />As for the molly (MDMA), I usually just roll it up in rice paper really tight and parachute it (swallow it). Sollemnis got the dosage down so just listen to him. ;)

				Most people here are saying to p-chute the molly. I would disagree there.<br /><br />My first time rolling, the friend who hooked me up made me eat a point and he looked at me and told me to REMEMBER THE TASTE. It&#039;ll taste bitter, and pretty bad, and it won&#039;t leave your mouth for awhile. Make sure to have a drink on hand.<br />But the taste is a pretty good indicator of quality. I wouldn&#039;t want to p-chute molly.<br />Plus, after coming down from that very first roll, I looked at my friend and told him &quot;It&#039;s really not that bad&quot; referring to the taste. It kind of grows on you.<br /><br />As for everything else, yeah, ~150mgs should do the trick. If you don&#039;t have a scale, some people just lick their finger, dip it in the baggie, and eat it. You can&#039;t really go wrong with your dose on molly. If you aren&#039;t feeling it within 5-10 minutes, try another small bit to get you there.<br /><br />What I love about MDMA, among other things, is how easily you can just eyeball it. You don&#039;t easily OD on it, and you can redose if you aren&#039;t rolling as hard as you would like.<br />JUST REMEMBER: DRINK WATER! Pretty much the only reason people get so fucked up while using MDMA is dehydration. Just drink lots of water during your roll and you&#039;ll be good.<br /><br />As tolerance builds for MDMA so quickly, always space your rolls at the very least three weeks apart. Most people suggest 1-2 months+.<br /><br />One last word of advice: For your first roll, I would HIGHLY recommend going to a show for it. I think most other people would as well. Find a big name you like in music, and find when they&#039;ll come perform near you. Rolling at a show is so much fun.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about acid yet.<br /><br />OH! And a perfect website you can and should always check about any drug: http://www.erowid.org<br />There you will find information on dosing, time duration, effects, and experience reports for almost all drugs.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun,<br />~Toker

Its good to know the taste!<br />Also OP take a look at &quot;the shroomery&quot; it has many trip reports for acid and will help you find out the dosage for your first time.
