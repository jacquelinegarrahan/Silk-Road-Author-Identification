				I honestly don&#039;t know anything first hand about IM injections but I know there are a lot of you on the forums who do.<br /><br />Heres what information would be most helpful,<br /><br />1. How to do it; the basics<br /><br />2. What not to do<br /><br />3. Best places to inject<br /><br />4.

				The best advice is not to inject anything IM. IV injection is actually safer. <br /><br />It&#039;s very easy to get an infection from IM injection, and if you get an infection it&#039;s in deep in the tissue and will require painful surgery to get rid of. There is unlikely to be much blood flow to the area, so antibiotics won&#039;t help - until it gets into your blood stream - then you could die. <br /><br />If you must for some reason inject IM (but don&#039;t) make a fist about at the area of your butt crack. Where your last knuckle will be, that&#039;s a safe place to inject. (but don&#039;t)<br /><br />

				In terms of the likleyhood of getting an infection IV injection is safer. The downside is that if you do get an infection it&#039;s more likely to kill you vs one you get from an IM injection - but when you use needles then you always take a chance. <br /><br />There are also certain things you should not IV - codeine for example - that can be taken IM.

				Ionno where the idea that one of two would be safer comes from, both IV and IM require the same safety measures and proper handling and you be good to go.<br /><br />For injection site and method, watch this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQor40vf7lE<br /><br />He&#039;s doing testosterone but it dun really make a difference what the substance is.

Always always use clean new needles, always! Don&#039;t skimp on that one, it could be the difference between a nice trip vs. a nasty abscess.<br /><br />If for whatever reason you can&#039;t get new, clean utensils. You must soak what you have in the isopropyl alc before using it. Do at least 2 minutes and make sure it&#039;s inside and out, meaning, load the syringe with alc through the needle and let it sit.<br /><br />Never ever skimp on your sterilizing, all the horror stories you hear are basically caused by unclean utensils or dirty water being used. If you can, use sterilized water to dissolve whatever you use.

				Here&#039;s a quickie tech for IM injection:<br /><br />IM injection it easy, best place is you thigh between your knee and mid to upper thigh.<br />Just kinda poke your finger into your thigh on the outside to half way down the side of your leg and try to find the muscle in your thigh under the fatty epidermis.<br />Push the needle thru your epidermis and you can feel when it hit the muscle.<br />Then pull stopper back after you get the needle in to be sure you aren&#039;t in a vein or artery.<br />If blood comes into syringe, do not inject...pull out needle and try another IM site.<br />Slowly push the stopper on your syringe in because if you do it too fast it will start to sting.<br />It usually takes me a 20-30 count to get a full 1ml into my muscle.<br />IM injection doesn&#039;t have to be all the way inside the muscle but it can be on the surface of the muscle as well.<br />Most ppl have syringes with 1/2&quot; needle pins, these work but if you want into the muscle you need a 1&quot; needle.<br /><br />I use the same types of insulin syringes IM or IV.<br />&quot;1ml, 1/2&quot; needle pin, 27-30 gauge&quot;...I usually use 28 gauge.<br /><br />For IM the bigger the needle point the faster to get the injection in, but a few seconds isn&#039;t a hinder to me, while IM&#039;ing.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				Californeeya, a big thanks for starting this thread as I&#039;m a fan of IM as a ROA for various things, and it is very difficult to find info on IM administration of various substances on the interwebz....<br /><br />I would like to add a don&#039;t, just in case anyone gets the same ideas I had:<br /><br />I got the grand idea to try IM for some 5-MeO-DALT that I had.&nbsp; It was in it&#039;s freebase form, so knowing that it would not be soluble in H2O, but would likely be in cottonseed oil (I have experience with anabolics and cottonseed oil is used as a carrier).&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought I would give that a shot to see if it would work.&nbsp; &nbsp;~ 50mg of 5-MeO-DALT freebase in 1.5 mL of cottonseed oil.&nbsp; &nbsp;It worked, but not like I wanted it to.&nbsp; &nbsp;Onset was within 15 minutes, but I think delivery was stretched out over about 48 hours and it pretty much sucked...just felt weird after about 4 hours for the next couple of days, tired and shaky.&nbsp; And mind you, I know better....KNOW better...but I didn&#039;t use proper sterilization techniques because I was so anxious to see how this works after reading reports of other tryptamines being administered this way....so now, my thigh has been sore as a bitch for almost 2 weeks now, a small knot in&nbsp; the&nbsp; muscle (slowly getting better thank God!)<br /><br />My point here is that:<br /><br />1.) it&#039;s probably not a good idea to try IM injections of *freebase* tryptamines for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2.) Research what you are doing beforehand and always, always use good techniques for sterilization, period.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />3.) Know the drug you are using.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if you don&#039;t care about chemistry, take the time to learn about freebases vs. salts if nothing else...I would say that it helps with any ROA, but it&#039;s invaluable info with IM injection.<br />4.) Not trying to threadjack here, but IM is a very important ROA when using some psychedelic tryptamines, so thus the reason for trying to provide a specific use-case.<br /><br />&nbsp; (***I think 5-MeO-DALT rocks btw, particularly when smoked as freebase or insufflated***)

				I&#039;d also add that 1/2 in. pin needles IMO probably ARE NOT a good idea....too hard to get into the muscle, since most ppl have 1/2 in. or almost almost of body fat, you&#039;re more likely to be deep subcutaneous.&nbsp; &nbsp;Get a real muscle needle.&nbsp; At least 1 in., if you are dealing with a smaller muscle group like deltoids, or 1 1/2 inch for thighs or glutes.<br /><br />Also,&nbsp; DON&#039;T just push the plunger in when you get the needle into the muscle...PULL BACK first to make sure you didn&#039;t hit a vein or an artery.&nbsp; Good idea to pull the needle out, change the needle and start over if you did.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you hit muscle you&#039;ll get resistance and the plunger will give a good deal of resistance.<br /><br />Also if you are self administering,&nbsp; working with something like DMT, DPT, etc and you just &quot;push the plunger in&quot; and you hit a vein or artery and get a blast of whatever straight to your brain and hit instant hyperspace, therein llies the possibility if a major freekout happens that a needle could get broken off in the muscle, with blood flying out the end, whatever, and a tryp to the E.R. and or jail, etc., etc., enjoy trying to expain all that.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />There are plenty of videos on the web that will give good instruction on how to give an IM injection.&nbsp; &nbsp;Search engines, YouTube, etc.<br /><br />EDIT: (after reading my own post a couple of times, relized that it didn&#039;t make sense to me even, so fixed my snafu&#039;s.

				I should have added, pull stopper back after you get the needle in to be sure you aren&#039;t in a vein or artery.<br />If blood comes into syringe, do not inject...pull out needle and try another IM site.<br />I&#039;ve had this happen twice, it&#039;s not a big deal but a must to get it in the muscle and not a vein or artery.<br />

				I always used a separate needle for extracting from the vial than I did to inject, in case some plastic got stuck in there or it dulled the needle or something.&nbsp; Probably not needed, but I had way more syringes / needles than I needed, so it couldn&#039;t hurt.<br /><br />I found 23g needles to be optimal.&nbsp; 18g would leave me sore for a couple days.&nbsp; Anything higher than 23g was hard to push through.<br /><br />Don&#039;t wipe the needle with cotton balls.&nbsp; If it&#039;s clean, don&#039;t wipe it at all.&nbsp; A stray fiber in your muscle is not a good thing. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s hard / expensive to get needles these days, but when I was doing IM injections you could just google a site and buy them for cheap.&nbsp; Absolutely no reason whatsoever to use a dirty needle.&nbsp; Hopefully that&#039;s still the case.<br /><br />Pull your skin tight and to the side, so that when you let go the hole in your muscle doesn&#039;t match up with the hole in your skin.&nbsp; I guess some people have had things seep back out.

				wish i wouldve known about the 23gauge needle thing, mine are 27gauge. i hate the thought of blasting muscle fibers away (ouch!) but i can handle a little sting. and hey, at least its not a 30ga like onlyadream<br /><br />so anyway, im fucking nervous as hell seeing as how i finally have my vial of K and syringes. they have been calling me but i have been scared to reply.<br /><br /><br />so here is what i plan on doing step by step. correct ANY mistakes i might make for me so i dont have to correct them myself after making said mistakes :P<br /><br /><br />1. Open up 2 syringes and fill up with 1ml of K each. <br />2. swab injection areas with alcohol. <br />3. push needle down into skin and pull back on plunger to make sure i didnt hit a vein. (omg im so squeemish this is going to freak me out)<br />4. slowly inject <br />5. profit??<br /><br /><br />questions, <br /><br />there is no need to sterilize the needle right? it comes sterile so that would be pointless correct? or should i wipe alcohol on it before i inject and make sure no fibers are stuck to the needle?<br /><br />im so worried about doing this wrong. this is the fine line that responsible drug users walk. if i seriously injure myself due to stupidity i will never be able to forgive myself. <br /><br /><br />btw, i tried looking on youtube to see how to do it, but it grosses me out too much. i know people will say &quot;then how do you plan on doing it yourself&quot;<br /><br />well, i plan on finding the injection site, placing needle on it, looking away and stabbing. sound like a good plan of action? i mean obviously im not going to thrust that bitch in there. or should I?<br /><br /><br />ugh sorry for all the noobish questions, but this is an information thread and i love practicing safety first. <br /><br />thanks guys i love you all :)<br />

				There&#039;s no need to stab yourself Californeeya, you can simply slowly push it in breaking the skin rarely hurts with new syringes it the contact with the muscle is where the little sting happens but you must have this sting to indicate you&#039;ve reached the muscle, other than that I thing you have it down, once you do it once you will feel a lot more comfortable doing it.<br />No reason to swab the needle it&#039;s sterilized already.<br />i&#039;m sure everything will be fine, the yes time I did an IM iwas a bit worried but it took about 20 minutes later before I was ready to do it again and again and again and never looked back.<br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath<br /><br />Always use liquid ketamine and never try shooting pills or opiates via IM, that is asking for trouble.<br />Just hold the skin down tight and release it once you have it to the muscle and before you start the injection as you start you will fill a pressure in your muscle and you should be able to do a 1 ml syringe in a 20 seconds if it goes in faster than that you are not really in a muscle and wasting the injection.<br />

				Sooooo......wow..injecting ketamine, by far, the best way to do it hands down. <br /><br /><br />back onto the topic at hand,<br /><br />Last night, i gave myself 4 IM injections. each went smoothly. only problem is, the first 2 i gave myself werent in the muscle, so i didnt feel anything. this was because i gave myself shots in the thigh,&nbsp; i knew that the deltoid wouldve worked better, so i got up and loaded up 2 more syringes, poked myself in the arm, made sure i didnt hit a vein, and slowly injected myself. wasnt a hard thing to do at all, even for the squeamish. there was little to no stinging, it actually went in faster then i expected so i was worried i didnt hit the muscle again, but all was well<br /><br />I must say, the thought of using a needle to administer drugs feels dirty and scary at first, but it is actually not as bad as i thought(i used a vial from a pharmacy, i would never put street drugs into a syringe and inject it) there was absolutely no pain, and minimal effort required, I mastered the art of IM injections by my 3rd try. <br /><br /><br />hahahah the fun part though, was injecting myself with the last dose, and starting to k-hole right before i had the plunger in. i had to scramble around and hurry as fast as i could to my bed since i was in the kitchen. by the time i got to my bed, i was floating on a magic carpet through the stars and galaxies. i felt so many complex emotions, but yet, i have never felt so safe in my life. <br /><br />this isnt a ketamine thread so i wont continue to talk about how awesome it is, but for those of you who are reading this because you are curious about IMing ketamine, my advice to you is to do it! but make sure it is in a vial. <br /><br /><br />oh and btw, its been ~12 hours since i k-holed, 3 of my injection sites feel no pain, one is a little sore. i got worried after i stuck my 4th needle in because i was trippen on K so hard, that i thought i forgot to wipe my arm with alcohol! injecting K into your body while on K, is definitely not smart to do. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Damn I gotta try K and MXE....well, tried snorting a couple lines like 17 years ago, but it just blended into whatever buzz I already had.&nbsp; MUST try again list.....<br /><br />One helpful thing I would like to throw in that I have not tried yet but plan on, is working on a how-to IM from powdered materials and converting from freebase or salt to water soluable injectable.&nbsp; (Not all salts are water-soluble, but it works within the range of things that most people want to IM.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will take a while to work something up, as far as the salt/freebase conversion, but if you already have a water-soluable powder material to start with, dissolving in a 1% water/benzyl alcohol solution. and heat sterilizing or at least, pasteurizing is a good start.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the drug will potentially break down due to heating, potential infections are mitigated by the benzyl alcohol.&nbsp; Benzyl alcohol does not per se destroy bacteria, but it does prevent further growth.&nbsp; It&#039;s a preservative, and used for these types of applications.&nbsp; &nbsp;It won&#039;t hurt you.&nbsp; It&#039;s readily obtainable on the Internet, as are pre-sterilized serum vials, to which you would transfer your &quot;gear&quot; after working it up.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend this to just anybody.&nbsp; I am comfortable with it because 1.) medical info is very easy to come by in my environs. 2.) I&#039;m pretty knowledgeable when it comes to chemistry/drugs and 3.) I have experience with IV usage and IM usage personally.<br /><br />The means I describe above have been used by steroid users who bottle their own juice for years.&nbsp; Now mind you, that in and of itself doesn&#039;t necessarily mean a damn thing....methodology is key here.....im just saying the theory is sound lol.<br /><br /><br /><br />Dissociatives and psychedelic tryptamines seems to lend extremely well to IM injection, which is why I&#039;m interested.

				I forgot to add for what it&#039;s worth, I have been on a couple of cycles of steroids in the past 5 years, and give myself B12 injections on a semi-regular basis, so I&#039;m pretty comfortable with it as an ROA.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m one of those who does care about sterilization and doing things the right way.&nbsp; &nbsp; I use alchohol preps on injection sites, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m paranoid.&nbsp; &nbsp; The first time (month ago now almost) i did anything stupid was with 5-MeO-DALT when I thought it would be ok to IM inject from the freebase (dumb, dumb move....just didn&#039;t work for shit and had mild infection for 2+ weeks)....THIS is the reason why I started researching about sterilization techs for different compounds and using benzyl alchohol for preserving.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was just over a little over a week ago that I finally was able to walk normally again after fucking up the quadriceps muscle in my right thigh. Dumb dumb dumb.&nbsp; &nbsp;THAT will NEVER happen again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got overly anxious when I found a good tryp for the first time in 10+ years and got careless.&nbsp; Paid the price for it too.&nbsp; Could have been Tetanus or worse (spelling?&nbsp; screw it.)<br /><br />by the way, Californeeya....if you trust someone else to do it for you, the glutes are the way to go, some can do it themselves. (me) with the quads as a second.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are just bigger muscle groups and it&#039;s easier to avoid veins and such.&nbsp; &nbsp; You will know in the 1st 24 hours if the stuff was clean or not.&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on the substance there may or may not be a knot in the muscle.&nbsp; &nbsp; If there is and you can forget about the knot in your daily duties, whatever it was was ok.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can&#039;t its a bad sign.&nbsp; &nbsp; From what i have read about Ket and MXE, they should be relatively painless, in contrast to water-based suspensions of testosterone, which supposedly hurt like a bitch.

				Why does IV K have such a bad rep? I know people who exclusively IV K.&nbsp; I gave up snorting it (a decade long habit) for IM, and it just didnt cut it. IV much cheaper too. quicker onset/comedown is a plus since thats the main reason for doing K rather than a longer acting disassociative.

This is small enough to filter out most (if not all?) of the harmful particles, including inorganic particulates and bacteria. It will not, however, filter out viruses--but that one is probably not an issue you need to worry about. I&#039;m still doing some research on it, so don&#039;t take my word as gospel or anything. <br /><br />You can find fairly cheap (~$0.50/filter) wheel filters on ebay. Make sure you pick out one that is compatible with the substance (and solvent) you will be filtering. I chose a cellulose filter for heroin and pills. It&#039;s not the very best filter, but it&#039;s sufficient and fairly cheap compared to some of the other materials. Just buy some sterile syringes with a luer lock, and you have yourself a complete filtering apparatus.

				Having developed a very nasty infection due to IM injection myself, may I recommend NEVER reusing needles or syringes (even on yourself). Always make sure you wipe the injection site with surgical spirit or similar first (ideally use purpose-made injection swaps as they don&#039;t leave any strands behind like cotton does). Pull the syringe slowly and evenly, for at least 30 seconds (ideally longer). Also, massage the muscle afterwards to help the liquid seep in. This is important, as even if your kit is clean, sterile abscesses can still form.<br /><br />Here&#039;s useful .pdf showing IM injection sites: http://www.shaman-australis.com/~pic/cs/nursing.pdf<br /><br />I have found that areas with less fat are best, as they heal faster and you&#039;re more likely to get right into the muscle. For me the deltoids are best.<br /><br />Also, z-tracking is good - this is where you pull the skin aside then inject. When you remove the needle, the skin goes back to its normal position. It&#039;s more hygienic as the liquid is &#039;sealed&#039; inside - plus it heals better. However, it&#039;s a bit tricky to perform on yourself sometimes. There&#039;s more info on this and diagrams in the .pdf listed above.

				Also, I would suggest 23 gauge needles (the blue ones). They go right the way in, until you can&#039;t see any needle at all. You want them to get right into the muscle.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re making your own juice from powder, definitely get a syringe (wheel) filter - the already sterile kind, not the autoclaveable ones.

				Listen, just don&#039;t IM. Taking drugs is a risk management exercise every time and the risks associated with IM-ing can&#039;t be rationalised. The effort required to mitigate risks is considerable and there are more viable alternatives for administration - such as insuffation, smoking or IV-ing.<br />Take care

IV injection is actually safer. <br /><br />It&#039;s very easy to get an infection from IM injection, and if you get an infection it&#039;s in deep in the tissue and will require painful surgery to get rid of. There is unlikely to be much blood flow to the area, so antibiotics won&#039;t help - until it gets into your blood stream - then you could die. <br /><br />If you must for some reason inject IM (but don&#039;t) make a fist about at the area of your butt crack. Where your last knuckle will be, that&#039;s a safe place to inject. (but don&#039;t)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is rubbish, IM is far safer than IV. You dont even need to sterilise the skin with IM injection, IV runs the risk of emboli/phlebitis/septicaemia etc. <br /><br />Before you flame me for saying you dont need to sterilize - i am a trainee medical professional, i&#039;ve seen doctors and nurses give IM injections without alcohol swabs because it is not neccessary. However there is nothing wrong with doing so; just use a 21g-23g needle, sterile/boiled water and IDEALLY medical grade ketamine. I do not recommend anything else IM as you dont know what the fuck is in even the most &quot;pure&quot; of powders<br /><br />Also you should not be using your deltoid guys; it can only hold 1ml of solution and the brachial artery and radial nerve run medially to it, thus the best place to inject, safely, with no risk of hitting any significant structures is the vastus lateralis muscle, This is the muscle of your upper leg, anteriolaterally/the front outer side; the big fat chunky one. It can hold 5ml of liquid at once.<br /><br />Dont use your ass; you can hit your sciatic nerve and give yourself a neural deficit. <br /><br />When you are injecting you should use a Z-track technique; this is fancy schmancy shit that&#039;ll impress your doc if you were to tell them (i dont really know why you would..), take your index and thumb and spread the skin apart over the intended site which you&#039;ve swabbed with alcohol, push the needle into the taught skin with the bevel edge downward untill you&#039;re about 3cm under the skin, draw back the syringe checking for blood, then inject. Remove the needle and let go of your skin; all the while keeping the skin taught when the needle is in the skin - this is to minimize bleeding. <br /><br />Use wheel filters ideally, sterile needles, sterile water and syringes, NEVER use injection equipment twice. and NEVER share a fucking needle - this includes the syringe itself!<br /><br />TL;DR, Only use your upper outer thigh, use sterile stuff all the time, IM injection is relatively safe and there&#039;s little to worry about with correct technique.

				This is a topic, to important to leave up to non professionals.<br /><br />My opinion is to get your advice from qualified personal only.<br /><br />Mainline for example has a course &quot;&quot;how to use a needle&quot;&quot;.<br /><br />Free spoons , acid, needles and so on also.<br /><br />copy and paste this;<br /><br />http://www.mainline.nl/en/training-and-expertise/other-activities/workshop-on-safe-injection-practices.html

				I just told you advice from a soon to be qualified health professional; IM injection/use of needles has this aura of mythic and extreme danger. As long as you use completely sterile kit and wheel filters it&#039;s not nearly as extreme as it&#039;s made out to be. But IM injection seems a but fuckin stupid to be honest, just snort your ketamine and save yourself the risk..

				Hello,<br />Recently a &quot;newbie&quot; to heroin who had ordered a .1 when I had that listing up sent me a message after the fact with questions. He wanted to know what is the starting dose he should use because it is only his second time IV&#039;ing. I let him know, &quot;listen if it&#039;s only your second time IV&#039;ing my best suggestion is to stay away from IV&#039;ing all together as you could become more addicted than you think and quickly. Stick with your most used method of sniffing for recreational use.&quot; I felt it was the proper thing to do.

				the first thing to do is not post in a thread on IM injecting :)<br /><br />For IM injections into the glute, make sure to inject into the upper outter quadrant(divide your cheek into 4 using a texta, upper outter is where its at) and press a finger deep into the spot you think is right, if you feel the cyatic nerve, thats definitely not the right spot to inject.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found easiest IM injections are into the delt, less chance of turning myself into a paraplegic

				Someone here posted that the best advice you can take about IM injection is simply to not do it. They are right. I&#039;ve had spinal surgery three times, so I know firsthand that I am very susceptible to staph infections. I also got a staph infection from an IM injection (NEVER IM morphine sulfate ER, by the way). A botched IM injection is a great way to get a staph infection, and these are really fucking painful. I fortunately was given plenty of oxycodone for my infection. But this is rare and I still cannot believe the doctors were dumb enough to give me it. I think most doctors will know that a patient with a massive abscess on their shoulder was likely doing an IM. If you&#039;re going to IM, look up online where the correct spots to do it are. If you think you can just IM in any muscle and it will work out, you are very mistaken. IM done by an amateur is not safe, and it is certainly no more safe than IV. I think a lot of people do IM because they are creeped out by IV (this was certainly the case for me) but you should know that IV is safer for a few very simply reasons: 1) as long you hit a vein and not an artery, you likely won&#039;t fuck it up 2) knowing whether or not you hit the vein is easy; as long as you have good pullback, you&#039;re all set. This is not the case with IM, it is very easy to miss the desired area. Also, if you feel muscle pain when doing IV, you will know that you accidentally hit an artery, and you can stop it immediately 3) with IM, even if you do hit the desired area, you are not guaranteed success. You could easily be injecting something that is going to clot in the muscle. Of course it is true that you can clot your veins and put unsafe/unclean things in them, but the issue of cleanliness applies to ALL injections, including and especially IM.<br /><br />In summation: don&#039;t do IM. You aren&#039;t being safer than a person who IV&#039;s, you are likely being less safe. If you do do IM, get good info on the correct locations, inject absolutely NO solids, and as always, be as clean as possible.

Research what you are doing beforehand and always, always use good techniques for sterilization, period.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />3.) Know the drug you are using.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if you don&#039;t care about chemistry, take the time to learn about freebases vs. salts if nothing else...I would say that it helps with any ROA, but it&#039;s invaluable info with IM injection.<br />4.) Not trying to threadjack here, but IM is a very important ROA when using some psychedelic tryptamines, so thus the reason for trying to provide a specific use-case.<br /><br />&nbsp; (***I think 5-MeO-DALT rocks btw, particularly when smoked as freebase or insufflated***)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Good advice but maybe for the wrong reasons--encasing any chemical in fat/oil will stretch out absorbtion and clearance times to the max. Ok for anabolic steroids and even desired, but a psychedilc never. In fact for those patients who are too crazy to take meds and need em, deconoate injx like you describe allow for dosing on weekly or biweekly schedules. Same is used for a Narcan antidote to alcoholism.

				so I just had yesterday this bag of i suppose very good #3 heroin.. light brown in powder..<br />I dont use heroin, actually never used before today.<br />I think that me and this friend of mine had some problem doing it cause it didn&#039;t disssolved on the water as i should have been..<br />Well let me tell you how it went..<br /><br />We started putting it in a spoon (I think something like 0.05..half of 0.1... we didn&#039;t had a scale :PP ) then in the spoon 1.5 mg of water .. mixed it up a bit with an electric stove hot. after a while of mixing the water and heroin i putted it near the stove wich was now very hot.. it almost started to boil (my friend had it boiled for some seconds) and there I was, mixing this stuff wich didn&#039;t became a one liquid. SORRY MY ENGLISH) but the H didnt go all in the water.. it wasnt a alltogheter liquid.. actually after heating it on the stove it looked like the water was on the outside of the spoon and the H more in the middle .... anyway i mixed it up a lil bit more.. (Oh yeah the citrus , I putted it after putting the water in the H. 3 drops of some concentrate lemon. ) After mixed it up a bit more i putted a lil filter in it and lifted it all up(from the original 1.5 mil of water there was now 0.9 or something left and alot of brow shit((H)) left in the spoon... is that NORMAL ?? ) and smashed it...<br /><br />I can tell you i&#039;ve used subutex 8 mg for years( not suboxone )IV...but didn&#039;t took any 30 hours before hitting the H. So I obviously have some tollerance for opiates but the heroin was my first time ever.. The first hit didn&#039;t actually said much.. the need of buprenorphine left my body but that was it. I did all this hbulabalula again and it hitted me better than the first one(i putted more H) .. now im just ok .. no need of subutux but I&#039;m sure we did something wrong because the heroin didnät disssolved in the water .. i could still see some sand of h in the water.. they didnt melted in one liquid.<br /><br />After I slammed the first one i got some real bad looking rash like from a plant of nicosia .. they just looked like bubble but i think they were just from the citrus.. some allergic reaction. they lasted for 5-10 min... on the second hit they were lil bit worst. I slammed it i a different place and i think the vein are there smaller so ...<br /><br /><br /><br />WELL IF ANYONE CAN TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO BETTER PLS , IM ALL EAR!!<br /><br />THANKS IN ADVANCE!!<br />WAITING FOR HEEEELP&nbsp; :)

				I have probably stuck a needle in my vein 1000 times over the last 25 years and yet I just cannot come to terms with IM. The thought of doing it makes me squirm. Just like the thought of a tetanus injection I guess. <br /><br />I have heard that skydivers who have jumped out of planes hundreds of times freeze up at the thought of base jumping off a cliff.
