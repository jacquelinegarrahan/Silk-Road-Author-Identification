				I understand that breakthrough DMT dose is one of the most intense drug experiences known to man. Although, how does a regular dose compare to this massive breakthrough dose?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to try DMT, but to be honest, I&#039;m not really looking for some profound life changing effects. I&#039;m happy with the person I am now, but I&#039;ve heard many people proclaim that DMT completely changed their lives, some for the better, some for worse. Should I maybe just avoid the drug altogether then if I don&#039;t want these effects?

				It&#039;s sort of like The Matrix.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Morpheus: This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It really depends on what you consider a regular dose. If you take a low dose it can be a lot like mushrooms. If you take a higher dose it&#039;s already stronger than most of my LSD and mushroom trips. Even pre-breakthrough doses are intense as fuck and nothing you look at is the same as it used to be... it&#039;s completely different. After you pass the fractal is when you breakthrough, and then you can go even deeper than that.

				? There is no regular dose of DMT.&nbsp; Either you break through or you don&#039;t.&nbsp; Anything under in my opinion possesses no value.&nbsp; You should avoid DMT all together if you&#039;re not looking to use it as a valuable tool.&nbsp; The short lasting &#039;high&#039;, isn&#039;t really worth shit and is just flat out confusing at times.&nbsp; But if you wanna smoke a lil dmt every couple mins no one is going to stop you, just a bit of a waste don&#039;t you think?

				I honestly think many of these life changing stories that people describe on dmt to be a bit exaggerated. I say go for it and breakthrough, you&#039;re not going to come out a person that your friends won&#039;t recognize. Its more of an experience that you&#039;ll feel is life changing because you were lucky enough to have it, not a personality change.

				I&#039;m in the minority on this, but I&#039;m a big advocate for low-dose dMT, particularly when infused into a changa blend. I find the effects of DMT/Caapi vine to be extremely pleasurable, controllable, and explorable, whereas the high-dose DMT breakthrough is of little value to me. I would say that low-dose crystalline DMT is probably not really worth it, but low-dose when mixed into changa is fucking rad. I&#039;ve been extracting my own dmt and making various changa blends and this stuff is the bee&#039;s knees. Much less intimidating as a starting point, too.
