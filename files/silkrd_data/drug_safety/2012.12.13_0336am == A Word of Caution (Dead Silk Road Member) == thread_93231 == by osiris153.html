				Now, before you begin to bash me, I love this website just as much as the next guy, and I would never want anything bad to happen to it. That being said, when certain things happen in your life, you begin to realize that moderation really is key and if you cannot excercise self control than access to internet drugs really should not be for you.<br /><br />One of my very close friends, who i introduced to this website around this time last year, who increasingly used it more and more over the past months. has passed away over this weekend as a result of an acceidental overdose. In his system they found a mix of benzodiazapenes and opiates, but not at any alarmingly high levels or anything. He was only 22 years old, was an honors university student, and a respected athlete around my community, as well an all around great guy, with a huge personality, who ALWAYS carried a smile on his face.<br /><br />If he were still alive right now, I know for a fact he would still condone the use of this website, but I just wanted to let everyone know of the serious risks that you face when doing drugs, and especially while mixing two extremely volotile substances. Always exercise caution, and never take anything for granted. <br /><br />You never want to be the guy who loses one of you best friends at 22, or even worse, be the 22 year old guy who&#039;s friends are left grieving behind.

				Unfortunately I&#039;ve lost a few friends to drug use. If not physically then emotionally. Respect your body and know your boundaries and do your research. Realize that your actions affect others as well as yourself.

People preach about abstinence from drugs, but these same people don&#039;t care about preaching information that will keep people safe if they do decide to take drugs. They see information on how to responsibly use drugs as being vulgar or something. People are going to do drugs regardless of the law. I don&#039;t see how making people have to do drugs behind closed doors is positive. Legalize and put the money/resources that were used on policing and incarceration into addiction treatment and the spreading of information on &quot;How to use safely if you must.&quot;<br /><br />But anyways, sorry to hear about this man. I&#039;ve dealt with the deaths of a few individuals that were really close, and its not fun. Let him live on through his legacy.

				My sincere condolences. I can remember seeing this one morning after a party. Not sure what the combo was or hell if it was even just alcohol - he could have been passed out drunk vomited and inhaled his own vomit and drown.<br /><br />I have narcan available, but that&#039;s no use if everyone else around is fucked up too. I&#039;m guess he was either alone, or someone sober wasn&#039;t watching him. Ya need to have a sober or semi-sober person around to give you that drug or else it&#039;s worthless in some cases. and at the very least strip the person of ID and drop em off at an ER or call 911... helll call and leave him on the hood of a car rather than leave him die (i&#039;m not saying you did this, I&#039;m saying from what I&#039;ve seen...... people know someone is fucked and they&#039;re afraid to do something because they don&#039;t want the cops at their house.... or they just &quot;let them sleep it off&quot;).<br /><br />People who are potentially overdosing are put in hallways at hospitals in plain view of all staff with a monitor until their body metabolizes the substances. even the hospitals fuck up and people die in plain sight though. so sad

				the investigation is still not done so the police have not released any details.. all anyone knows is he was found upstairs sitting up in a chair in someone elses apartment, so he had to be with someone, identities still haven&#039;t been given. weird how he was found a good few hours after the estimated time of death though... it&#039;ll all come out soon, but i probably won&#039;t be posting it on an internet forum.

				Sorry for your loss.&nbsp; While your friend might&#039;ve been headed for an early grave in any case, I have a difficult time believing that decriminalizing would lead to very many unintended overdoses. At the very least, H broken down into little mg packets, like all the &quot;normal&quot; drugs out there, can&#039;t be a bad thing.&nbsp; At least people wouldn&#039;t be surprised by an especially strong batch or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whatever the reasons behind your friends OD, people here understand.&nbsp; A lot of them.&nbsp; Sucks.<br /><br />I feel compelled to point out that you put an awful lot of info in that post alone.&nbsp; The most minimal of LE work would get your probable location (place where your buddy lived), and a bit more might get a name.&nbsp; Not many 22 year old athlete honors students ODing on a particular weekend.&nbsp; Especially when something like this happens, please be careful.&nbsp; Assuming you are who you say you are and not LE fishing for info in this or another case (which I do), who knows what a prosecutor might do with the info you just typed if he can tie it to you.&nbsp; Even an accusation that it was you who typed it would crush your irl rep, I&#039;m guessing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Take care of yourself.

				@Osiris firstly I am really sorry about the loss of your friend, unfortunately there are far too many deaths caused from opiates and Benzos, through my work we are always highlighting the dangers of using CNS depressants and still we continue to hear about fatal overdoses, at the moment through the forum we are pushing to have a community Naloxone programme in Ireland @Novartis its a sad state that people have to buy on SR and not to be able to obtain Naloxone in their communities , don&#039;t misunderstand me your providing a necessary service and its obviously needed. In this case I don&#039;t think Narcan may have worked due to the use of Benzos even though Naloxone is a miracle substance and saves many lives each year it doesn&#039;t work if benzos have been used or alcohol as it only works on the opiate receptors <br /><br />@Novartis please can you DM me like to chat with you

				Sorry for your loss dude, sadly in drugcircles it seems pretty common to lose a friend at some point<br />I hope you dont feel you are to blame for this, we all make our own decisions and are responsible for them. <br />His need to try and use narcotics was his, he would have acquired them from other, probably more dangerous, sources if SR did not exist.<br /><br />Posting this is a nice gesture to, sadly reflecting on the possible risks we all take usually only happens after a tragedy closeby.<br />I didnt know him or you but your post made me reflect, which is good.<br /><br />Something i noticed in my own circle is that friends seem very shy to point out to other friends (possible) abuse and their worries of it ending bad. <br />So i would like to add to this thread that if you have friends whose habits worry you, just tell them and have serious talk about it. <br />You might help them realise or even save their life.<br /><br />Again my condolences,<br /><br />sam

				So sorry for your loss, O. My thoughts are with you and his family. I OD&#039;d on the same combo a few years back and ended up being one of the lucky ones that was around the right people and very close to a hospital. <br /><br />I love what SR stands for, because it&#039;s bigger than just drugs (no matter what certain people tell the masses); having said that, I hope everyone that reads this uses O&#039;s advice. Take the necessary precautions, use proper judgement, and know your limits.<br /><br />Once again, my condolences for losing such a close friend.&nbsp; :&#039;(

I understand that they found benzo&#039;s and opiates, but apparently not at lethal levels. This does leave me with a bit of a question: Which substance (or combination) actually resulted in his death? Did he actually take a fatal mix of these substances, and if so, it would be important to learn what it was exactly to prevent others from the same faith.<br /><br />Even if the consequences are this grim, it would be important to learn what exactly happened - I&#039;m sure your friend would be interested in the mechanism behind it if he would have still been alive.
