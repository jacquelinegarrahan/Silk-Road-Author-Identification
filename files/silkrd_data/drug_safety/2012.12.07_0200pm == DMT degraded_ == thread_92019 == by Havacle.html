				I had a small amount of DMT in storage, have had it for about a year, actually. It has been in multiple layers of plastic bags, wrapped up tight. It was white crystal, now it has browned a little, and has lost a lot of it&#039;s smell. Is it fucked?

				Generally mimosa should not go bad even after months/years. If it looks fine and doesnt have some mutant fungus growing on it, its perfect :) There are reports of people using mimosa that was for many months or even years in a drawer without any significant problem (though as with anything, its always more prudent to store in dark, dry, cold place).<br /><br />http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/DMT_N-Oxide_to_Freebase_DMT<br /><br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=3570<br /><br />The main possible degradation is of dmt into dmt n-oxide. Dmt n-oxide is also psychoactive, but it is not soluble in naphtha, which may cause some people to get small yields when extracting from older bark. N-oxide is soluble in limonene/xylene/toluene/etc, so one could extract it with those solvents without loss of yield. Alternatively, N-oxide can be converted back to dmt using zinc dust, see link below<br /><br />For oral usage of mimosa, formation of n-oxide wouldnt really affect much as it will be water soluble so one will still get the effects when consuming the brew.

Yeah, I&#039;ve been leery of freezer, but a month or so ago I tested 1 &amp; 1/2 tabs of wow lsd that came from Joot, and got little to nothing. Though I was on mdma at the time, and that specific timing/combo has been problematic for me before. Anyway, I guess what I&#039;m saying is I probably need to rethink my storage practices lol.
