				Hey guys!<br /><br />I was wondering how long one could hold on to MDMA crystals/powder before they start to go bad or lose their magic. I have a couple rocks that have been sealed in a jar for about a month now which is why I am asking...<br /><br />Any info will help.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Forever.&nbsp; They don&#039;t really expire if you take care of them...and by take care of them, I mean don&#039;t get them wet and don&#039;t bake them in the oven =)

				Like they are in an air tight sealed jar is fine. Also in a dark place (not direct sunlight) that isn&#039;t too hot.

				Just to expand on this the Phenethylamine chemical class and subsequently the Amphetamine chemical class in the vast majority are very stable compounds. They pretty much last forever so long as they are kept away from light and in a sealed bag. Even if you leave them out in the air and they oxidize they last ages. There are the rare exceptions but on the whole they are very stable. The ones you have to worry about are Tryptamines (the LAD compounds being the obvious example) and Tropes (Cocaine takes in moisture and it knackers it).

				I left some oily MDMA out in the sun so it evaporates. Wasn&#039;t much, around 80mg. Should I expect it degraded?<br /><br />It was left in the sun for about 4 hours.

				It was MDMA crystals, but they were oily, most like saffrole/sassafrass oil. The oil just made them clump together. The % of the oil was less than 5-10% of the whole mass.<br /><br />They just needed an acetone wash but I didn&#039;t have the acetone at the time so I thought leaving them out in the sun might be a good idea to evaporate the oil. The oil just remained as it was lol, didn&#039;t evaporate.<br /><br />Oil, resembles wax as well, you know what I&#039;m talking about.<br />Got the stuff from juergen.

				No, 4 hours of sunlight won&#039;t affect the MDMA, it takes a few weeks of direct sunlight to make a difference.
