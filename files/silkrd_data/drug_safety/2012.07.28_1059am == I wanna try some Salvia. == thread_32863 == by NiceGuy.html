				1. Please do lots of research on it to know what to expect.<br />2. Have a sober person there to keep you seated and safe.<br />3. Do NOT smoke all of it at once. Try one or two long tokes at most, then try again another day.<br /><br />You may feel that time slows down to a stop. <br />You may feel dizzy. Lie down, it&#039;s okay.<br />Your post smoke might have cold sweat and intense thoughts.<br /><br />Prepare some cool water for after, the smoke may burn.<br />It can be a &#039;fun&#039; trip, but remember Salvia can freak you out fairly easily if you haven&#039;t experienced it before.

				My advice is to start with a low extract - I think a lot of people start too high and that&#039;s why they freak the fuck out.<br /><br />Or smoke some DMT :)<br /><br />^I prefer it to Salvia.

				To be honest, most people, including myself find Salvia to be an unenjoyable experience. That doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not worthwhile, it&#039;s a difficult experience which teaches you.

				Salvia is a highly trippy drug with virtually no &quot;fun&quot; value to it. Some may find value in the other worldly experience, but I just find it terrifying. Here are my thoughts however:<br /><br />1: The drug seems to have a reverse tolerance. Every new time I tried it I would get way more high. This may or may not be due to mastering the technique, which brings me to my next point.<br /><br />2: The ingestion technique requires some skill to maximize the effect. If you want full effect, use a big bong or the tube from a box vaporizer. Take slow, long and deep draws and only do one. If you perform this part right then you will be out of this world. <br /><br />3: If you are to get really high, you won&#039;t be able to function in normal life. Where I live this is legal so I would do it in public places. Nothing like a crowd of people in a park gathering around you come back to reality after ripping a load of salvia from a vaporizer tube.<br /><br />4: If you do salvia while already high on other psychedelics, get ready to have the experience prolonged more than anybody would want. I took a very small, threshold amount of mescaline one time and then hit the salvia bong a few years ago back in college in an outdoor setting. This caused an intense salvia high which lasted for an hour. I had to have friends help me around as I could not see the world around me and was stuck in another dimension. Very terrifying. <br /><br />5: if you understand the power of the drug, go for it. <br /><br />Hope that helps, bud! <br />

				Ive done salvia many many times, probably close to thirty, but not in the last year because of its adverse affects.<br />First off you have to get the black salvia extract not the &quot;purple sticky&quot; that is avaible in most headshops.<br /><br />Second know your dose, a small dose is fun and will result with you laughing and laughing uncontrollably.<br />A large dose will send you into a hell that can and will give you an out of body experience that will be terror.<br />There are so many physical affects as well when under the drug.&nbsp; Your muscles will have a mind of there own and <br />you must have a sitter under these situations because you will fall.<br /><br />If anyone has done salvia and not experienced any of the affects ive listed you have not smoked good salvia.<br />Salvia dragon.com sells the best salvia ive used but be very careful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally i will never use salvia again so do yourself a favor and don&#039;t ruin it for yourself, take a low dose and have a <br />fun time with your friends.

				I smoked a good pinch of 20x salvia extract last friday night with a mate. First experience.&nbsp; He was eager to try it first but after a big bong hit, he went through a terrifying experience - seeing the dense sea of atoms that he said he was drowning in and was afraid he would be squashed in the tiny &#039;wormhole&#039; he had to fit through - understandably he was terrified. All the time I was comforting him and trying to get through to him by stroking his arm and back and&nbsp; reassuring him that he wasn&#039;t drowning or hadn&#039;t died - like he had imagined (it seemed he may have gone through a type of spiritual death and rebirth experience?) I kept reassuring him that it would be over in minutes and to try to just observe what is happening and detach from it.<br /><br />Anyway within 5 mins he was back and even began giggling a little. He had remembered almost every part of his experience and we talked about it, although he was clearly frightened by it. Then it was my turn. I put approximately the same amount in the bong with the damiana mixture and inhaled until my throat couldn&#039;t take the heat any more- and literally in a flash I found myself - firstly in some kind of outdoor (it was about 11.30pm real time) shelter with benches and people on a normal sunny day. One guy who sort of resembled my mate, but wearing sunglasses was lying sideways on a far bench (later my mate told me he was sitting next to me on the low sofa the whole time) staring at me! It irritated me not knowing if it was him or not. Then I was in a room of pale, yellow, glossy wood with a long rectangular window on one side from which I could see bright green foilage. First I wondered if I was in some southern US state? But I live in Australia. There were nondescript people around just like at the outdoor shelter (bus terminal?). There was also a grey mist/cloud filled with people at the edge of the obscured misty side of the room. They were communicating with me - very friendly - and I remember I was very curious about being shown through the grey mist. I think I said to them - telepathically - &#039; i&#039;m so grateful but you&#039;ll make me forget all of this, won&#039;t you.? but they never answered clearly. Next thing I know I was back in my mate&#039;s living room! He told me I said &quot;Am I back&#039;?.<br /><br />I usually do thorough research into what I&#039;m taking and I had admitted to him that I hadn&#039;t had time to do enough research on salvia before we had smoked it. But because he was keen to try it, I decided to go along - although I had wanted to increase the amount by small amounts. Oh yeh, we used two bic lighters to make the mixture burn hot - because I had heard a butane lighter is better for salvia and we were out of butane.<br /><br />Summary:&nbsp; Although I have never tried or been interested in dissociatives - salvia felt like one to me. I was totally disconnected from any living. organic reality and switched to what I would describe as a lucid dream state. It had absolutely no spiritual/psychedelic feeling about it. And even though my friend&nbsp; had experienced frightening effects of fabrics of atoms and molecules about to crush him to fit through an infinitely small hole, he also agreed it felt, very much like a lucid dream, so realistic that one can be fooled it is reality. I also found it devoid of the spiritual or religious qualities - experienced with LSD, mescaline, psylocybin or psyilosin.&nbsp; Today I looked it up on wikipedia and found out that salvia is classed as a&nbsp; dissociative and deliriant. Anyway, that explains the bizzare, unusual and for a lot of people - terrifying effects of salvia. I have yet to try the &#039;fun&#039; doses of 5x ... but it&#039;s still an interesting drug -&nbsp; if you&#039;re into dissociatives. <br />

				Oh Salvia - a love / hate relationshit.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried Salvia many times and stopped once I just couldn&#039;t figure the shit out. To me, every high was a completely different experience. The first was the most terrifying. A friend was telling me about this a few years back and said I had to try this &#039;weed&#039;. Up to that point I never heard of Salvia before. He loads up a huge bong load and kept telling me to slowly inhale until I was completely full and to hold it in. Once I blew out the smoke he started laughing and waving at me saying &#039;Bye-Bye&#039;. I remember him gently floating away into nothingness, I was definitely somewhere I have never been or can even explain but I remember the feelings of horror to this day...next thing I know when I came too I was outside across the street, naked and panting like a dog on a hot summers day. For about an hour after I sat in a daze trying to figure out WTF just happened. After that experience I learned that too much is just plain Ol&#039; foolish.

				I purchased salvia back in 2010, still have a few baggies left.<br /><br />Tried it a few times, didn&#039;t quite like the experience, I think it&#039;s because I have to smoke it outside, and not in the comfort of my basement couch.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give it another try one of these days though..........

				Every time I do Salvia I tell myself i&#039;ll never do it again, then a few months later...someone offers and I do it again and the cycle continues!<br />Unfortunately, my state recently outlawed Salvia, but you can still find some shitty low level stuff in a few shops.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a reaction at all with anything less than 60x in many different forms and brands. <br />But I have a weird tolerance...
