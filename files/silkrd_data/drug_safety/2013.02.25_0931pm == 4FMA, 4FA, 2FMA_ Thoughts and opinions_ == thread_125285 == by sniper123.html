				I just received my sample from fiberoptic. Let the research begin! <br /><br />Substance:4fma<br />ROA:Smoked out of light bulb<br />Dosage:200mg<br />Effects noticed are:mood uplift, mental stimulation&nbsp; Body euphoria&nbsp; Small empathy. Dry mouth. Cold limbs Tachardia. (subtle, nothing compared to mdpv.) Body seems to be relaxed. Very subtle body stimulation. No jitters.<br />Sticky throat and lungs. (minor lung irritation. I believe it&#039;s the fluorine, since i get the same lung irritation from 4fa-kb48 and 5fur-144<br /><br />Substance:2fma<br />ROA:Smoked out of light bulb<br />Effects noticed:Mental stimulation, dry mouth, Cold limbs. Body seemed slightly tense. Small nausea. No jitters. <br /><br />I found the 4fma to be more rolly. It reminded me more of MDMA. 2FMA reminded me more of aphetamine. (It was more mental stimulating and focused. I see it being used for a study aid.) I really enjoyed the 4fma when it came to empathy. Overall, both substances seemed very clean. <br /><br />The packaging was professional. It appeared to be legitimately from where it claimed to be from.&nbsp; Vacuum sealed.<br /><br />So all in all. Everything seems in order and FireOptic is a blessing for someone that has been searching and searching for domestic 4fma and 2fma. I highly recommend this vendor!

				a few days ago I posted a link to a file about some research that was done about 4-FA and 4-FMA, <br />but since then it seems that the forum page on which I posted this link was deleted - I cannot even find a trace of it in my list of posts... very strange... and I&#039;m sorry, but I can&#039;t remember where the link was going to on the clearnet...<br />if you can find my previous post, do read the info (it seems to be quite unhealthy...) and lett me know where you found it... <br /><br />4-FA and 4-FMA are not the same product, but if I remember right, 4-FMA splits into 4-FA after a while in your body and thus the toxicity is quite similar

Thanks for your input SS. It&#039;s good to get a fellow meth user to chime in.

				Well I got it from Rinran, and the MDPV from him is... well I&#039;ve never had MDPV before, but it seems perfectly fine to me.&nbsp; I mean I enjoy the odd 5-10mg on top of my constant meth, but not enough to do it all the time or anything.&nbsp; So anyway, my point is that I have no reason to suspect the quality is questionable.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;And no, I can&#039;t really elaborate, honestly.&nbsp; It&#039;s not any specific sensation, just... well you know how there are drugs that you just kind of don&#039;t like, but until you&#039;ve taken them a few times you can&#039;t really identify the specific sensation they cause in order to say &quot;yeah, I&#039;m quite sure now that I don&#039;t like this?&quot;&nbsp; Well it&#039;s like that, except I&#039;ve only tried it 2 or 3 times so I can&#039;t pinpoint the effects very well yet.<br />&nbsp;

				After dedicating a couple hours to research of 4-FA here are my conclusions. I mostly used BlueLight, erowid, drug-forums, etc. <br /><br />So 4-FA is supposedly like somewhere between MDMA and meth. A good starting dose is about 100mg orally and 20mg nasally (excruciatingly painful). It&#039;s especially not good to do too much cuz it just ruins the trip. It&#039;s pretty bad for one&#039;s body so it shouldn&#039;t be abused often but with the negative effects that may occur the next day, it is unlikely to become addicted. However it is possible. Appetite tends to be suppressed.&nbsp; Music tends to sound better. There&#039;s a euphoria involved for about 3-4 hours which is the peak but the trip can last for a very long time (6-12 hours). Effects can still be felt the next day. <br /><br />UPDATE: I snorted approximately 25mg of 2-FMA. It didn&#039;t hurt too bad but had no effect. Over an hour later, I mixed approximately 100mg of 4-FA in a drink. It was super fun! I felt so good and sociable even though I was alone (and planned to be). I tried to do normal work stuff but couldn&#039;t focus. I was pretty jittery and awake all night. However, my jaw was very tense. It&#039;s a few days later now, and it still hurts. Please make sure you&#039;re not overworking your jaw while on this stuff. The next night day I took a nap and felt so refreshed. That night I mixed about 100mg of 4-FMA in a drink. It didn&#039;t have the same mood increase but I still had fun. My girlfriend was kind of acting like me the night before on the 4-FA so I think it had something to do with tolerance. We talked for about 7 hours straight and still felt there was so much else we wanted to talk about. It was amazing and therapeutic. I imagine that&#039;s what doctors had in mind when they had the idea to use MDMA for couples therapy. Again, up all night, yet still not a worn out feeling from it. I definitely will be taking a nice break from any and all amphetamines though because I don&#039;t think my body appreciated what I put it through. Haha
