				Hi.<br /><br />I want to start exploring psychedelic drugs - but I&#039;m not sure what to take first. LSD is too strong for a first timer, so what do you think it&#039;s best to do? Shrooms? Mescaline? 2C-NBOMe? Please somebody experienced give me some advice :)<br /><br />Thanks.

				2C-B and 2C-I are very forgiving and friendly psychedelics even at higher doses, for a first timer I&#039;d recommend 30mg of 2C-B. You&#039;ll trip balls, but still keep your head. 1mg of 25c-nBOME would be very good too.<br /><br />

				I say a half-eighth of shrooms.<br />1.75-2.25 gram range.&nbsp; Not overwhelming, but a PERFECT intro to psychs. Go outside, love nature. <br /><br />the 2C- family is nice, but for me they cause a lot of stimulation/body load.&nbsp; Start with the classics, boyo<br /><br />Second choice.. 25I-NBOMe or 25C-NBOMe.

				<br />Before RC&#039;s and before the 2C family were well known, there was LSD and mushrooms which were the customary intro to psychedelics.<br />Don&#039;t be afraid to start there. Just start small and work your way to a place where you are comfortable. Like what crib said<br />But if you are not comfortable with those, I think the mildest out there would be 2c-c. 40 mg is really light on the body, very relaxing actually, and only mildly visually stimulating.<br />Happy tripping.

				Not to toot my own horn, but I have shrooms that are pretty much what I would give to first timers. Its a very pleasant mellow high on two -three grams dried.<br /><br />I would recommend shrooms in general though. I love me my psychedelics. :)

				I&#039;d suggest mushrooms because they&#039;re both euphoric and visual but do start small and work your way up. A large dose of shrooms can make you lose your mind... literally&nbsp; :o

My first time was a microdot and I was a bit wary so I only took half. Back in the day microdots didn&#039;t have a lot of LSD on them anyway. But it was a good place to start. I laughed a lot and had some minor visual stimulation. After that I was full in. I&#039;d do as much as I could afford, which wasn&#039;t much :)

				Its the 2nd time at SR I&#039;ve come across this assumption that LSD wont be good for a first timer.... Whats the deal???? Who/where is the source of this whacky info? 100-150ug LSD trip, I I honestly think is fantastic for a first timer. Also, 25c-Nbome 600-800ug will be super-fine.. wavy visuals with no mind games or body loads.<br /><br />Regardless which one you take for a first timer, more important than the actual substance, will be getting the dose right. For that reason I would recommend something in TAB form, and do your research about threshold amounts. Go just above threshold.

				I haven&#039;t tried the I but it looks like a common dose of that is between 10-20mg.<br />As far as the C goes 25mg will be a super light effect.<br />Maybe you could take 15 of the I and 25 of the C. That might be a good time :D

				I agree with LexusMiles that the dose is actually more important than the substance you start with. Do not underestimate the power of psychedelics. Start with low doses and then work your way up because you never know what your personal sensitivity to a chemical will be. Clean LSD could provide an amazing but not overwhelming experience at a low dose. I appreciate LSD because of how non-toxic the dosages are. <br /><br />I started with 1.75 g of shrooms, which is a fairly decent place to tread into the water... the benefit of psilocin is that it does not last as long as some of the other experiences. However, it is also slightly more difficult to dose exactly, as the potency and quality of effects vary between strains. After experiencing other psychedelics however, I no longer enjoy shrooms as much. <br /><br />I would actually recommend that you start with mescaline if you are prepared for a long experience. At a low dose (approx 175 mg) the experience is mildly psychedelic (so easy to handle) and provides energy and euphoria somewhat comparable to MDMA without the neurotoxicity. Mescaline is the classical, natural psychedelic that all the phenethylamine RCs are based on, so I would recommend it before trying them. It can be more difficult to find however if you are not willing to do an extraction from the legal cacti. Extractions really are not that difficult if you research the process and it can be extremely rewarding to trip on something youve pulled if you have the capability. You would need access to a good scale to measure the dose.<br /><br />Start with a classic!!! The longer the history of safe human use and the more research done is for the better! LSD and Psilocin have been used in human patients in very recent medical settings, so you can be sure that their general safety is not in question. This can help relieve some of the anxiety that can be caused by psychedelics. Some of the research chems can be deadly if misused or dosed improperly so they should not be used by inexperienced individuals!!!<br /><br />Branflakes, at 18 mg I did not find 2C-I to be very intense. It was fairly enjoyable and mildly psychedelic, so 15 mg may be a decent place to start. You could take 25 mg of 2c-c but it would be a relatively disappointing experience most likely.

I&#039;ll just bounce from this part ^<br /><br />Reminds me of the last rationalization loop I experienced. After dosing a bit over my weight on an RC, I had to fall back on some rationalizations to stay on the enjoyable zone. Rationalization (i) was, &quot;I just have to hold out for 2 more hours... watch the clock.. only 1 hour + 59 minutes to go&quot;.. and rationalization (ii) was, &quot;In all human history no person has ever died from... oh crap.. this stuff is relatively new.. I&#039;m on my own now&quot;, so that loop didn&#039;t work. For this reason its good to be classic such as LSD or some other well known, as microRNA said... its the best anxiety buster. Just fall back on history, and the many dozens or hundreds of erowid reports etc that you might have read.

				My 2 cents?<br />Take LSD.<br /><br />You have more than 40 years of documented evidence of it&#039;s effects.<br />The blotters are measured so that one is enough for a first timer.<br /><br />It&#039;s also the best psych I&#039;ve taken.<br />Setting is important for all psychs but I&#039;ve found LSD to be very forgiving.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think it hasn&#039;t taken hold and take a second.<br />Let me repeat. It takes a long time to kick in. Do not take a second if you think it&#039;s not working.

				I changed idea :D<br />I&#039;ll do LSD. After reading some more on the web I found a low dose of LSD is better for a beginner.<br />Also, I&#039;m broke atm and LSD is cheaper than shrooms :D<br />streetpharmacy&#039;s blotters are cheap so I&#039;m thinking to buy some of them, but i don&#039;t know if I should:<br />- Buy 2 Flying keys (pretty weak), take one and if I want another one after 1 - 2 hours<br />- Buy 1 Hoffman, take half and if I want another half after 1 - 2 hours<br />- Buy 1 Hoffman and take it<br /><br />I will be the only person tripping but I have a friend or two that will stay with me.

				Don&#039;t buy the flying keys, they&#039;re very unevenly dosed.<br /><br />Take 1 Hofmann. I bought some from SP a couple weeks ago and 1 tab is a good dose for a first time tripper. <br /><br />Don&#039;t take half in my opinion because you might just not really feel it. <br />From my experience, they were less potent than advertized (let&#039;s say around 70-100 mics) but SP is a top shelf vendor and his communication and service are just perfect.<br /><br />And I think that starting with LSD is better than trying shrooms. Looking back at my trips, LSD seems to be more euphoric and less mindfucking then shrooms, with better visuals also (again IMO).<br /><br /><br /><br />
