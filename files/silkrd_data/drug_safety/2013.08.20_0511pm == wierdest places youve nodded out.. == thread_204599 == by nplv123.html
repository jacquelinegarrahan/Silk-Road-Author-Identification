				Ive nodded out (while on heroin for the most part) in all kinds of places. all the standard spots, like on the toilet, at computer desk,&nbsp; sitting up on the edge of my bed, while driving a few times (couple minor car accidents), eating and ended up face first into your plate lol.. while getting a hair cut, at the dmv getting my license renewed, in court after getting arrested for heroin/cocaine possession..<br /><br />as you can see some spots are dangerous, some are just hilarious.

				I from time to time nod out in a park near the foothills at night.&nbsp; I also nod off in the foothills near my drop as well.&nbsp; <br />Sometimes I find myself nodding out in the back of the 7-11 near &quot;our Drop&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />We are actually living a great life selling&nbsp; illegal substances to those who really need or want them <br /><br />Also do we get to move to different cities and places every so often and have an abudant amount of drugs and cash. <br /><br />Though with all this money power and drugs comes lots of parania! <br /><br />but I always promise myself I&#039;ll skip over these people and take off with a good amount of money and drugs and take off in the wind.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel places like tor here and silkroad allow myself to express the life that I live and the things I see daily without prying eyes trying to track us down. <br /><br />&nbsp;well sorry about the long ranting but those are the places I&#039;ve been nodding out lately since were in this beautiful area of B.C Canada right now.

				Which is why you should remain extreme caution when taking drugs and driving.<br /><br />Even without taking any drugs or alcohol i often forget parts of a car trip, which is probably normal as is uneventful tedious work.<br /><br />Sedatives and sleep deprivation make things worse though. Reported cases often involve collisions between drivers, but the real danger of driving impeded is simply nodding off and running intp a tree as you drive on straight wherever the road curves :D

				Only time I&#039;ve nodded anywhere besides my couch was in history class in high school. Was working on paperwork in a group and the next thing I know Im lifting my head off my drool covered worksheet with my group of 4 girls all staring at me like I was a stoner burn out. First time I ever tried oxy&#039;s, and when I realized how great opiates could be.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve just been nodding out on my couch off the stash of subutex I&#039;ve got

I have nodded out driving on the interstate a few times, but luckily It was a quick safe recovery.<br /><br />The typical Bathroom Nod.<br />College<br />Just about every room in my home.<br />I have also done the eating nod. except I tend to fall back rather then forward into the food.<br />Texting, hell even talking on my phone.<br />I swear to god, I have even nodded out eating pussy, LMFAO.. snorted about 75mg opana IR<br />Let me just say, this one did NOT end well. talk about a pissed chick.<br /><br />In doctors office (many many times)<br />In church with fam (many many times, this one is quite funny cause ill end up with my head back and it causes snoring)<br />Movies (who hasn&#039;t)<br />Parties (not safe to nod out around a fuck ton of people you DO NOT know, you might wake up with no drugs or money)<br />on the computer more times than I can even count. I love coming out of a nod and seeing sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss<br />about a thousand times more. (for some reason it&#039;s always &quot;S&quot; at first then you will start seeing ;;;;;;;lllllsssssss;<br />almost like I am twitching.<br /><br />starbucks, mcdonalds, and a few other food joints.<br />IN A POLICE STATION, and they were quick nod in and outs like I was fighting it so bad. (went home that night)<br />in jail, ended up getting sent to detox tank and slept for almost 2 days after a methadone binge. lets just say the remainder of my &quot;visit&quot; was hell.<br /><br />If any more come to me, I&#039;ll post again. This is fun trying to remember so many years worth of nod outs.

				I remember when i railed my first whole oxy (usually i do half), and went to the store to get something to drink. half way there i started to get all wobbly and fell on these bushes and i was feeling so good that it actually felt comfy and just didn&#039;t do anything about it. i am not sure how long i was there but i am surprised no one tried to wake me up. or maybe they did try but i was feeling too good. too high, didn&#039;t care<br />another time i was getting groceries, and hit my noodle on the cart and knocked shit over. good times
