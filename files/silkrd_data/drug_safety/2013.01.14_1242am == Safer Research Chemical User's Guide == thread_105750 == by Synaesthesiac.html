				&nbsp; Hello all.&nbsp; A cursory perusal of the first few pages of Harm Reduction topics reveals just how often questions about these Research Chemicals are posed to this forum.&nbsp; A little bit of further inspection reveals further the inherent dangers and precautions one must take to avoid calamity or harm when trying these chemicals for the first time.&nbsp; In my searching I have found one thing crystal clear:&nbsp; These chemicals can be dangerous when misused and must be treated with a healthy dose of respect.&nbsp; This being said, I find that anyone with a modicum of intelligence and the will for self-preservation would take heed to these warnings and take measures to never act until that decision to ingest these chemicals is in fact an INFORMED decision based on research and careful reading and understanding of these compounds.&nbsp; However, with the accessibility of these compounds only a quick click away and no way to ensure that the consumer has the necessary knowledge to navigate the precarious waters of chemical self-discovery, I find that it is inevitable that ill-informed people will hurt themselves.&nbsp; This will happen.&nbsp; In the interest of perhaps centralizing some of this information and providing one place for people to read all the information they need to know to act safely, I am starting this thread as a general RC facts/safe practices hub for any information you all might have.&nbsp; It has been my own growing interest in experimentation with some of these compounds has caused me to seek out all the relevant information.&nbsp; Those of you with experience, please enlighten us as to your learning curves with these substances.&nbsp; To kick it off, here is a guide that I have found useful as a starting point:<br />(Clearnet Link!)<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Safer_Research_Chemical_Users_Guide<br />(Clearnet Link!)

				I have extensive history with experimenting with RCs. I have made many mistakes and have also had many successes. The following is a list of what I would suggest to make it as simple as possible:<br /><br />1. Get a scale. Measure out your doses according to Erowid dosage charts. If dosage charts are not available and you are pioneering your way through this, begin very, very small. Find out what the lowest active amount is and measure that. Take it, and wait. Do not take a bump straight out of the bag you just ordered. Never assume that the product you got is pure.<br /><br />2. If you have figured out that the drug you have is, in fact, the drug you thought it was, go back to step 1 and MEASURE YOUR DOSE BEFORE TAKING IT. Then enjoy.<br /><br />3. Do not redose. Cannot stress this one enough. This idea was not perpetuated too commonly at the beginning of the RC movement (as far as I know) because there were not many stimulant or MDXX RCs out there, but now with drugs like MDPV, Methylone, 4-FA, etc we are seeing many many issues with chronic redosing habits. Do not redose the RC until you are comfortable with using it and are aware of the dangers you are taking upon yourself.<br /><br />4. Have respect. Try to take the drug within the appropriate context. That means don&#039;t take that new DOC blotter at your family&#039;s First Communion party. Your little brother/cousin/nephew will be scarred for life, and probably so will you. That also means don&#039;t take a bump of your newly acquired 2C-C before you go out to the movies just because you think it MIGHT be a good time. You don&#039;t know this, and you don&#039;t know anything about the chem. Be respectful, and your drugs will respect you. With time, you will have the opportunities to play out all those great fantasies that you&#039;ve been dreaming up in your little drug-minds. For now, go slow and learn all that you can about your new substance.<br /><br />5. Follow all these above steps all over again when introducing new people to the drug. Everyone reacts differently do different drugs, and you never know how someone else may react. I knew a dealer once that would dose people 20-35 mg of 2C-E ON AVERAGE. Some of these people had a great fucking time, and other people flipped out and nearly had to go to a hospital. Others ended up in psychiatric facilities for a night or two. All because the dealer didn&#039;t think to stop and consider that other people were not ready to have a mind/body/earth/reality shattering trip at that time of their lives. <br /><br /><br />They are RESEARCH CHEMICALS. Do your homework, kiddies. Then go outside and have fun :)

				2c-e is a weird drug, it has barely any effect on me. I could take 35 mg of it and go to school and give a presentation (trust me!).

				by the time I take enough 2c-e that it makes me feel like I am actually tripping decently, I feel tingling sensations in my kidneys. It is just so weird to me that it has so little effect on me when other people take small doses of it and are blown away. All the other 2c-x drugs I have tried I had an expected reaction to but 2c-e was kind of a disappointment really. <br /><br />Also just to add something of actual value to this thread, I would put right up there with getting a scale getting a reagent kit. You can&#039;t know what you have from reagent testing, but you can know what you don&#039;t have and take a guess as to what it might be. Usually that is enough. If you want to be ultra safe you can send small samples of your drugs anonymously to labs that test them with more advanced equipment and publish the results online, at least in some nations these labs are actually run by the governments but if you live in a country that wants drug users to die then it might be trickier.

				good thread!<br />i would like to add allergy testing to the list. Start with a very very small dose below threshold...

				Thank you Valakki, Allergy testing IS definitely an important part of the RC experimentation process.&nbsp; Safety starts here.&nbsp; I will copy&nbsp; a quick excerpt from the guide I posted above for those who don&#039;t want to go hunting for it:<br /><br />&quot;Many people have drug allergies and it is not unreasonable to assume that you may have an allergy for a compound that has not coexisted with humanity for any evolutionarily appreciable period of time. The trick is how do you find out if you have an allergy or other idiosyncratic reaction to a new compound without being exposed to it? Well unless you are an professional allergist or have a very trusted friend who is one, the odds are you will have to take the compound and see. There certainly are safer ways to do this. This treatise will outline one for water soluble compounds.<br /><br />Measure out approximately 5 mg. of your material (this does not have to be overly exact as long as it is fairly close to 5 mg., really anywhere from 2-10 mg. is fine). Dissolve your 5 mg. in 1 liter of distilled water and allow to go into solution. Your solution should now have a concentration of approximately 5 µg. / ml. Measure out 1 ml of water and hold it in your mouth for 5-10 minutes to see if any reaction occurs. If not swallow and wait 1 hour to see if any reaction occurs. If no reaction has occurred, repeat the same operation with 2 ml of water. At the end of that hour repeat with 5 ml of water. This can continue along until you reach a level where you are satisfied that you will not have an extreme anaphylactic reaction. Ideally you probably would want to go up to about 1/10th of an active dose or so. The amount required to do this will of course depend on the compound in question and its presumed active dose.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;This seems to be a pretty efficient method to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m loving the responses so far, thank you everybody for your input thus far.&nbsp; Let&#039;s keep this thread growing in the interest of safety.&nbsp; ;)

				Labeling certain drugs as RCs is bullshit IMO and does absolutely no good. All precautionary measures for &quot;regular&quot; drugs apply to RCs just the same.<br />/rant<br /><br />Also, all of what zipstyle said.

				Ballzinator-<br /><br />I agree with you wholeheartedly in regards to the seemingly inefficient criteria in deeming a substance a &quot;Research Chemical&quot;;&nbsp; As a true believer in harm reduction, I will always advise anybody curious about drug experimentation to act from an informed perspective and take all the precautions necessary to be safe and have a good time.&nbsp; In this regard I couldn&#039;t agree with you more.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp; however clumsily labeled this class of drugs may be, I do still see SOME merit in these drugs being awarded a class of their own.&nbsp; Let me explain a few reasons why:<br /><br />1.)&nbsp; Quite literally, these chemicals are in the &quot;research&quot; stage, a term I&#039;m going to use to loosely define drugs that we don&#039;t know a lot about insofar as interactions with human beings.&nbsp; In this sense &quot;Research Chemical&quot; is more of a transitional label, a label that would apply to a new compound until its effects on human beings are documented more to the extent of your &quot;classical&quot; drugs.&nbsp; <br />2.)&nbsp; The name &quot;Research Chemical&quot; immediately inspires a sense of caution; THIS IS IMPORTANT.&nbsp; Right off the bat it is apparent that there is not a lot known about these compounds.<br />3.)&nbsp; Since many of these drugs can be much, MUCH more dangerous than conventional drugs at incredibly small doses, and since a lot of these drugs are very similar in dosing, effects, and duration (at least within the same class), I feel it is appropriate for now to segregate RC&#039;s.&nbsp; By placing these drugs in their own category and providing a more stringent list of safety rules and precautions, you require your average user familiar with conventional drugs to do some research and learn about this new &quot;class&quot; of drugs.<br /><br />By simply stating that this class of drugs is &quot;different&quot; you encourage people to do their homework and find out just WHY they are a class of their own.&nbsp; Who cares if AFTER all the research they decide that some of these chems aren&#039;t so different than conventional drugs after all?&nbsp; They still had to learn about them to come to that conclusion.&nbsp; Can you imagine the problems if fentanyl were billed as just another opioid when it came out?&nbsp; or MDPV as another speed?&nbsp; Your average unintelligent user will think they know everything about how to dose/take any new opiate/speed/downer etc. because their experience with conventional drugs has taught them this.&nbsp; They think they know &quot;speeds&quot; or &quot;opiates&quot; or how to handle &quot;psychedelics.&quot;&nbsp; But as soon as you call it something else--research chemical-- you are inclined to find out more about it, or at least WHY it is called a Research Chemical.<br /><br />But these are just some of my musings.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; :P

				@CiscoYankerStuck: No problem&nbsp; :D. <br /><br />Let&#039;s keep the facts and suggestions rolling guys!&nbsp; Please feel free to post your experiences with any of these Research Chemicals here too.&nbsp; Your experiences, although subjective, are still valuable raw data and I&#039;d love it if they were shared here.

				Also another concern i have is the fact that these rc&#039;s are getting cheaper every day. Does that mean a decline in quality, like other drugs? (From what i&#039;m seeing quality is remaining the same or climbing in purity.) So, how are they cutting corners to provide a cheaper product. (The most bang for your buck.) The only time I&#039;ve seen chemicals become cheaper is when one of two things happen. 1.Quality of the product drops. 2.When more adulterants are used or the adulterants become cheaper. Anyone have some information on this?

				It could be a few different things that make them cheaper.&nbsp; maybe more people buying them means suppliers are buying bigger quantities which means cheaper for them and they are passing savings.&nbsp; could be so much stock they want to get rid of what they have.&nbsp; Could also be suppliers trying to get rid of things they fear will be banned and want to sell as much as they can before they have to put it on the black market.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know for sure either why they keep getting cheaper but those would be some of my guesses.
