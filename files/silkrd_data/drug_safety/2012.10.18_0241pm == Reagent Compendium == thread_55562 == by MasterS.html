				Make Your Own Reagents<br /><br />Here are instructions on how to make reagents (you can also buy testing kits) and some references for a few drugs. <br /><br />A.1 Scott test<br />Chemical Name: Cobalt Thiocyanate<br />Preparation: Dissolve 2.0 g of cobalt (II) thiocyanate in 100 mL of distilled water.<br />Procedure: Place approximately 2 to 4 milligrams of a target substance in a glass test tube, then add 5 drops of cobalt thiocyanate reagent. After shaking, 1 or 2 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, and the tube is again shaken. Ten drops of chloroform (or a similar solvent) are then added, and the tube is vortexed, and then allowed to settle and separate into two layers. The color is then observed.<br />Also, here are some other reagents that may be of interest.<br /><br />A.2 Dille-Koppanyi Reagent, Modified<br />Tests for: Barbiturates<br />Solution A: Dissolve 0.1 g of cobalt (II) acetate dihydrate in 100 mL of methanol. Add 0.2 mL of glacial acetic acid and mix.<br />Solution B: Add 5 mL of isopropylamine to 95 mL of methanol.<br />Procedure: Add 2 volumes of solution A to the drug, followed by 1 volume of solution B.<br /><br />A.3 Duquenois-Levine Reagent, Modified<br />Tests for: Cannabis<br />Solution A: Add 2.5 mL of acetaldehyde and 2.0 g of vanillin to 100 mL of 95 percent ethanol.<br />Solution B: Concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br />Solution C: Chloroform.<br />Procedure: Add 1 volume of solution A to the drug and shake for 1 min. Then add 1 volume of solution B. Agitate gently, and determine the color produced. Add 3 volumes of solution C and note whether the color is extracted from the mixture to A and B.<br /><br />A.4 Mandelin Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent: Suspend 1 g of finely powdered ammonium vanadate in 100 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (relative density 1.86). <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a small test tube. <br />- Add one drop of Mandelin Reagent. <br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br />A.5 Marquis Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent 1: Add 8-10 drops (approx. 0.25 ml) of 37% formaldehyde solution to 10 ml of glacial acetic acid. <br />Reagent 2: Concentrated sulphuric acid. <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a depression on a spot plate. <br />- Add one drop of Reagent 1, then one drop of Reagent 2, and stir. <br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br />A.6 Nitric Acid<br /><br />A.7 Erlich&#039;s Test (aka PDMAB Test)<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent: Dissolve 0.5 g p-dimethylaminobenzaledehyde (p-DMAB) in 50 ml ethanol and 50 ml conc. hydrochloric acid. <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a small test tube. <br />- Add one drop of Erlich&#039;s Reagent. <br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br />A.8 Ferric Chloride<br /><br />A.9 Froede Reagent<br /><br />A.10 Mecke Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent: Dissolve 1 g selenious acid in 100 ml conc. sulfuric acid. <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a small test tube. <br />- Add one drop of Mecke Reagent. <br />Reagent Preparation<br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br />A.11 Zwikker Reagent<br /><br />A.12 Simon’s Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />reagent 1: Dissolve 2 g of sodium carbonate in 100 ml of water <br />(=2% aqueous sodium carbonate solution). <br />Reagent 2: Dissolve 0.9 g of sodium nitroprusside in 90 ml of water (=1% aqueous sodium nitroprusside solution). Methylone Reagent 3: Mix 10 ml of acetaldehyde solution and 10 ml of ethanol (=50% (v/v) ethanolic acetaldehyde solution). <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a depression on a spot plate. <br />- Add one drop of Reagent 1 and stir. <br />- Add one drop of Reagent 2, and then one drop of Reagent 3. <br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br />Sodium Nitroprusside Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent 1: Mix 25 ml of a 1% sodium nitroprusside solution with 1 ml acetaldehyde. <br />Reagent 2: 2% sodium carbonate solution. <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a depression on a spot plate. <br />- Add one drop of Reagent 1 and stir. <br />- Add one drop of Reagent 2. <br />- The color is formed immediately after Reagent 2 is added.<br /><br />Gallic Acid Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent: Dissolve 0.1 g of gallic acid in 20 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid (=0.5% (w/v) solution) <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a small test tube. <br />- Add one drop of Gallic Acid Reagent. <br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br />Chen&#039;s Test<br />Reagent Preparation<br />Reagent 1: Add 1 ml of glacial acetic acid to 100 ml of water (=1% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid solution). <br />Reagent 2: Dissolve 1 g of copper (II) sulphate in 100 ml of water (=1% (w/v) aqueous CuSO4 solution). <br />Reagent 3: Dissolve 8 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of water (=2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution). <br />Procedure<br />- Place a small amount (1-2 mg of powder, or 1-2 drops of a liquid) of the suspected material in a depression on a spot plate. <br />- Add 2 drops of Reagent 1. <br />- Add 2 drops of Reagent 2, then add 2 drops of Reagent 3 and stir. <br />- Observe the color of the mixture. <br /><br /><br /><br />Reference: Color Test Reagents/Kits for Preliminary Identification of Drugs of Abuse, NIJ Standard–0604.01<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If anyone has any reagent formulas to share that are missing that would be great, otherwise I&quot;ll find them eventually. Also any new and more relevant chemicals to add to the list, let me know and I will add them and add it to the list. This becomes better with input and shared knowledge.

				Concerning the A.7 - the Ehrlich reagent test:<br /><br />This was a cool idea...what molarity does the &quot;concentrated hydrochloric acid solution&quot; need to be? Do you know if high-proof drinking alcohol would work?

				My chemistry is much more limited than I&#039;d like.<br /><br />50ml of Everclear should be an adequate substitution over lab grade Ethanol. Everclear is only a few % less concentrated. The HCL just says concentrated. I&#039;m not sure if the manual I read specified, if not, I assume the higher the better for a more clear reaction. Less pure means more diluted the color will appear.<br /><br />

				Yeah, if only we were all master organic chemists ::)<br /><br />If my Everclear comes from a state that only allows ~150 proof rather than the higher proof stuff in other states, do you still think this work? I&#039;m more just interested than anything - p-DMAB doesn&#039;t sound like something I want to try acquiring/handling lol.<br /><br />As for the HCL, I know that Walmart sells some sort of concentrated HCL solution in heavy duty packaging for unclogging drains, though I admittedly haven&#039;t looked at how strong the label says it is (I would HOPE it lets you know how strong it is).<br /><br />Again, my interest is purely intellectual. I won&#039;t be attempting to grab myself any p-DMAB anytime soon.
