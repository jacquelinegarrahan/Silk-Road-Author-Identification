				Hey guys, I&#039;ve always been kind of shy about coke and the stigma around it. Can&#039;t really explain why, I just hadn&#039;t even really thought about it until a few months ago. Well I was really drunk last week, ordering on SR and got a gram of some fishscale so I figured I&#039;d come here for proper dosage etc.<br />Feel free to post other things like fun things you like to do while on it etc. Anything. Thanks!

				Start off with around a 50mg line and work up from there. If it&#039;s good coke, 50mg will give you a good solid buzz. <br />Fucking bitches is a good activity whilst on cocaine. Also drinking alcohol is fucking good and increases the buzz a lot. But keep it sensible, no more than say a few beers as it creates cocaethylene in your liver which can be extremely dangerous. <br />Have fun!

				I would suggest smoking a bit of it before you start snorting any. <br /><br />Obviously you will not get as much bang for the buck when you smoke coke, but it will give you some sense of its milder effects.

				so for that doses here seem ok, 50mg should be a decent start. I&#039;d suggest having someone you can talk to (or talk at lol) because there&#039;s a high probability that you&#039;ll want to talk your jaw off. Could possibly do it will a friend or just have someone close around.

				the problem is with redosing! your gonna do it again and again and again till its gone. and your gonna end up a shaking sweaty mess...<br /><br />but its fun!!! <br />the best advice i can give you is don&#039;t buy more for a while.. do it all, bump it till its gone like crazy and then wait a few months before buying another batch....

				A few things which I wish I had been told before I started snorting coke:<br /><br />1) Sterilize the surface on which you chop up your C! Alcohol wipes are an easy way to do this. I normally use a sturdy laminated book cover as my surface because I found that crushing rocks on a mirror or piece of glass left me with little coke crumbs flying everywhere, whereas a book cover has a little more give / spring in it and is thus much less likely to cause this to happen.<br /><br />2) Sterilize a credit-card to use to chop up your C! Again alcohol wipes are an easy way to do this. I prefer a card over a razorblade because although a razorblade is sterile initially I&#039;ve found they rust quickly and rust is definitely not healthy for you! Also, slightly angling the card on its side provides that nice thin edge which is the only benefit of razorblades.<br /><br />3) Chop up your coke as much as physically possible! Chop it into grains of sand, and then make it finer. This increases the surface area of the coke and makes it much more easily absorbed into your sinuses. Also, a line of big grainy coke when properly chopped up can turn into two fine powder lines of the same size. This makes dosing much safer as you can snort a 50mg fine powder line that measures 3cm for example, instead of a 3cm grainy line that weighs 100mg. I&#039;ve found that the finer the powder, the smoother up the nose it goes ;)<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t use a rolled-up bank note as your snorting straw! This can transmit diseases very easily, and I&#039;m assuming you don&#039;t want that. Instead use a drinking straw fresh from its packet, as these are pre-sterilized. If you prefer something with a wider diameter then trace a bank note onto a clean fresh piece of white bleached paper that has no ink on it. Cut it out, and then cut it in half as regular paper is thicker than money paper. Roll this up like a regular bank note and tape it in place.<br /><br />5) Take roughly 50mg as your first dose, and then leave it at least 30 minutes before re-dosing. It&#039;s also a good idea to measure your heart rate after a little while, and if it&#039;s higher than 160bpm as you are at a complete rest then it might be a good idea to visit the hospital. Stabbing chest pains are also a good indication that you should seek medical help. If you have any previous heart problems then it&#039;s best not to touch the stuff in the first place.<br /><br />6) For your first time, don&#039;t mix coke with other drugs. Just see how it affects you on its own. <br /><br />7) If it&#039;s good coke then you&#039;ll want to do more and more. I don&#039;t recommend doing more than 0.3g in your first sitting, as you could end up as a shaking sweaty mess with a thumping pressure in your head. <br /><br />8) Don&#039;t buy more coke until you&#039;ve finished the gram you already have. A coke habit is ridiculously easy to develop. <br /><br />9) If you&#039;re a guy, then having a lady at your disposal during a coke session is amazing. Railing a line off a nice round ass before fucking it is one of the best feelings ever.<br /><br />That&#039;s about all I have to say, I hope you have fun, and I&#039;m sure you will. Just remember, coke is like an attractive wife; at the start shes great all day long, but before you know it she&#039;s gotten old, ugly and starts sucking the life out of your soul instead of the cum out of your dick ;)<br />- JH

				Hey, unless you do not now the purity of it, i would suggest a small line. Do not do a fucking lizard line, or you could die. Treat it with respect, cocaine is a serious drug, do not order it very often.<br /><br />Let us know how it worked out

				*Moments after the last line* <br />&nbsp;<br />Person A: Is it really all gone?!<br />Person B: Yep, lets check the table for left over dust!<br />Person A: Nah, lets get another ball and keep this party going.<br />Person B: I&#039;m broke man.<br /><br />Welcome to a bad habit. It is a very lovely drug, but as said before VERY addictive. I have never had something other than crack or powder give me the need to do another line or smoke within minutes after dosing lol....

Anyway...if he&#039;s a yayo n00b...it&#039;s likely he won&#039;t be able to turn it into rock anyway without wasting his whole purchase.<br /><br />Coke is one drug the has drastically different effects when administered via different methods:<br />1. Insuffilation: Best way to keep it at a social level and keep you use and your life in check<br />2. Smoking: Best way to feel great for 5 minutes...and then to blow out your bank account in hours, while peeking out the window looking for the cops you swear you saw outside that really aren&#039;t there<br />3. Injection: The most amazing high ever to be felt...and drastically different from #1 and #2. You literally &quot;get your bell rung&quot;...but this also leads to the same as #2...but worse

				Wow guys, I would just like to thank each and every one of you for your input. The community on the road is unlike any others. The coke is gone now and it was fun. I never did more than probably .15-.2 in a night. Never got super fucked up, but I sure did talk a lot.<br />I really liked it and have a strange longing for that diesel taste again, but I&#039;m not really craving it. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll order some more after finals but again, THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE INPUT! You guys are saints. :)
