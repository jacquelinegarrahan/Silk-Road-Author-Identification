				Hi,<br />Anyone know how to positively ID fake oxy 80? Got some IR that looked legit made by a Canadian generic pharm but had weird effect, definitely not the same as usual. I just take orally.<br /><br />Anyway visited the generic pharmacy website and they don&#039;t make an IR only ER. Anyone offer advice? I should mention one more thing. The blue coating is easily wiped off with a moist finger,almost like it&#039;s painted on.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Alot of &quot;counterfeit&quot; oxycodone uses a tramdadol formulation instead of oxy. I had this same experience using silk road.<br /><br />Yes, there is a 100% way to check to see if you&#039;re taking real oxy.<br /><br />If you have ebay access, this is the cheapest way. Amazon has other options but ebay is cheapest so far. Search for &quot;marquis reagent test kit&quot; or along that lines. I use Marquis because that is what most police kits include. Basically what you get is a bottle of diluted sulfuric acid with formyldehide(sp) and you scrape off a tiny bit of the pill and put it in the included vial and then put 2 or 3 drops on the powdered pill inside the vial. This not only tests oxy, but a multitude of other drugs. Each drug will create a different color in the vial. For oxy, it will turn a pale violet color. <br /><br />Don&#039;t listen to people who say you need to pay $150 to send it to a lab. You waste 150$ and you lose your pill. There&#039;s a reason why police use reagent testing for field stops and why the results are admissable in court. It&#039;s nearly 100% accurate.<br /><br />Just use caution in handling the liquid as it is very acidic. Please PM me and I can give you more detailed information if you have any questions.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				Well, it was confirmed by the vendor they are fakes. Getting my money back but I&#039;m more concerned what I have put in my body. This pisses me off.

				Back in the day, I used to always assume you could never get ripped off with pills. Ah, the days of naievity... Yeah fake Roxy 30&#039;s are the main ones I&#039;ve seen. They&#039;re really pale and crumble to nothing with the slightest bit of pressure.

				There was a fentanyl (and analog) fake oxy situation earlier this year, although the ones I&#039;ve seen were green. Same thing, outer coating that rubbed off with a white interior, they were very poorly done and very, very crumbly. I don&#039;t recall seeing the assay on the fentanyl or analog though.&nbsp; <br />The ones I&#039;ve seen did NOT have additional oxycodone in them to confuse issues on reagent testing. <br /><br />Did you check ecstasydata and bluelight already?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				One time me and my friend bought some roxicodone 30&#039;s.<br /><br />But they were ones I&#039;ve never seen like before. Very bright dark blue and extremely hard.&nbsp; But it did get me really fucked up.&nbsp; Way more than any other legit ones I&#039;ve taken.&nbsp; I believe it had a K9 or V on it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if they were fake though.

				Fake pills come in various forms. Some actually do contain the active substance in the amount labeled, but simply are not&nbsp; manufacturered by a genuine pharma company. The consistency of such tablets may be very different from the proper deal, but the active substance is there and they will work just as well as the real deal.<br /><br />It gets more insidious when tablets contain a substance different from what you were ordering, or perhaps a mixture of ingredients that somehow result in a similar effect. If you suspect this is the case the only real way to prove it is to send samples of the real deal and the fake to a chemist and have the difference sorted out. Tests like tasting/smelling a substance are usually not conclusive as non-active ingredients in the tablets play a large role there.
