				Hello all!&nbsp; I am an experienced psychonaut who has never had the chance to try MDMA.&nbsp; My drugs of choice are psychedelics such as LSD and Shrooms.&nbsp; I recently ordered some bud and decided to grab an MDMA pill with it.&nbsp; It is a Pink Question Mark and is advertised as 200mg.<br /><br />I am 6&#039;3&quot; and 265lbs.&nbsp; Do you think I will have a good experience from a 200mg dose?&nbsp; Also, how do you prepare for a roll?&nbsp; Eat before hand or drop it on an empty stomach?&nbsp; What should I have ready or on hand during the roll?<br /><br />Any advise is helpful.&nbsp; Feel free to answer any questions I didn&#039;t ask.&nbsp; Thanks.

				At 265 lbs 200mg should be a good dose take the whole pill at once on an empty stomach. Do some research into pre-loading and post-loading to make you&#039;re roll nicer and minimize your chance of hangover.

				At 265 lbs you should definitely drop the entire pill from the get-go. You may want to also pick up another one of those &quot;?&quot;s, trust us. The first time is always magical.<br /><br />If you could provide is with more details on set and setting, we will be able to tailor our responses for maximum enjoyment :) However, here are a few universal tips:<br /><br />Before you roll:<br />1. You don&#039;t need to prep anything beforehand since this is your first time. Just make sure you aren&#039;t already high on anything, and have had some time since you last tripped for maximum enjoyment (1-2 days of sobriety)<br /><br />Dropping:<br />1. When you drop, please do it at least 2 hours after eating. Since you have experience with shrooms, you know how it is tripping when you just ate.<br />2. Prepare music. Electronic Dance Music (EDM) works exceptionally well when you are rolling. You will seriously &#039;feel&#039; the music down to your soul. Here are some solid song selections that never fail to impress and invigorate:<br /><br />Play at high volumes!<br />Sebastian Ingrosso ft. Ryan Tedder - Calling (Lose My Mind) &lt; get the extended version for even more fun<br />Eva Simons - I Don&#039;t Like You<br />Zedd ft. Matthew Koma - Spectrum (the vocals will shoot you to the stars)<br />Hardwell - Spaceman<br />Calvin Harris ft. Example - We&#039;ll Be Coming Back<br />Knife Party - Antidote (watch the explicit music video, it will rock your socks)<br /><br />3. Find someone else to do it with you (with another ?). MDMA is a seriously social experience, especially the first time.<br />4. Make SURE to drink at LEAST 1 pint of water per hour. MORE if you are a sweaty sweaty mess on the dancefloor. If you can, you should also prepare at least 2 bottles of sports drinks (Gatorade) to replace essential salts in your body. Doubly important if you are a sweaty mess.<br />5. Prepare MENTHOL cigarettes. You may not like them usually, but when you roll they are freaking amazing.<br />6. Get a VICKS INHALER. Uniquely exciting for the nose.<br /><br />Post roll:<br />1. Eat a well balanced meal the next day.<br />2. Take 5-HTP supplements. Since it&#039;s your first time you probably wont&#039; have a hangover, so this is optional.<br />3. Reflect on your night. Seriously, you have to think about how awesome it is because it&#039;s so awesome. Play another EDM song to see if you still feel it down to your bones.<br />4. Smoke a joint, it helps alot with relaxation.<br />5. Drink more water!! The dehydration will last for at least 2 days if you&#039;re not careful.<br /><br />Fun things to do while rolling:<br />1. Dance. Loud music feels so awesome<br />2. Talk. Connect with your best friends, MDMA brings people very very close<br />3. Laugh. The world will look like a brilliant brilliant perfect place.<br />4. Scream. Show everyone just how much you are up there<br />5. Watch a sunrise. It is beautiful as FUCK.<br />6. Roll around in the grass. It feels amazing.<br />7. Of course, sex. If you can somehow get it up, it feels gooood.<br />8. Get someone to drive you on a highway with music.<br />9. Hugs<br />10. Massages feel great. Really really great.<br /><br />This quotation captures the feeling:<br /><br />You&#039;ve gotta dance like nobody&#039;s watching,<br />Love like you&#039;ll never be hurt,<br />Sing like there&#039;s nobody listening,<br />And live like it&#039;s heaven on earth.<br />-- William W. Purkey
