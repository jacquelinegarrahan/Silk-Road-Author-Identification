				I&#039;m a first timer (close enough) and I ordered the 120-130 mg pills. I appreciate that XCTEXPRESS has a big selection. To some extent I can agree with you, if he had offered 110-120 mg pills instead of 310 mg pills, that&#039;s what I would have ordered, and as a result I would have taken a lower dose. However, demand determines the free market, and every buyer has the ultimate responsibility to know what they are buying. No government or health specialists can say &quot;ecstacy pills are banned&quot; or &quot;ecstacy pills 300 mg+ are banned&quot; here, and that&#039;s the beauty of this place. I suspect there might be some large regular users who want the 310 mg pills, and if not, XTCEXPRESS will stop making them. A little warning that the 310 mg pills are super strong and not a good idea if you&#039;re a first time user wouldn&#039;t hurt, though, especially since kids may buy them.

				Imho it&#039;s always your own responsibility to do some research on the drugs you take. I&#039;ve tried lots of pills and especially in times when you buy them on the street and don&#039;t exactly know how much is in it you&#039;d always start with half a pill. I&#039;d happily take half a skull. They look beautiful and it&#039;s a guaranteed heavy roll for 2 even if you have just 1 pill :D <br />BTW - XTCEXPRESS has put up an advice for use, stating that half a pill is recommended. <br /><br />Anyways, as soon as I get my decibels and see that shipping is no problem I&#039;ll order some skulls for sure!

				I think its a good thing that these pills are occasionally made, its not very often we see such high strength beans, its a good thing for collectors of these great stamps :) i personally do have a high tolerance, not sure if i would go the full whack of a skull though.

				Sounds like a good splitter.<br /><br />Though I DOUBT it REALLY contains 310mg. I mean seriously.<br />Not to mention that most people max out around 210-240mg so how would you even know.

				Even if you have a tolerance MDMA is never good for anyone at 310 there is no reason for it. Your brain can only produce and use so serotonin, dopamine, norepienphrine, etc. All you are doing when you increase the amount of MDMA is increasing the side effects such as jaw clenching, sweating, speeding etc. I would only by these pills if I wanted to split them.

				Wow dude 180x 3 is alot of MDMA, <br /><br />You taking that all in one mouth full? or through the nights?<br />&nbsp;I suggest you should crush up your pills and take them like that. <br />that way you will only have to do 180x 1 pill, because it will kick in 15 mins. <br /><br />And yes I can make 3.5g of coke gone in 4 hours too. Only after a few day binge though, if long break taken, then 2 grams would last 4 hours.<br /><br />His grenades are Fire!!!
