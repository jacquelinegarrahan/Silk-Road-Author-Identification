				Greetings-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll keep it simple, I always hear about athletes who use steroids to grow muscle tissue and basically become stronger and more fit looking-I&#039;m basically wondering if you all could possibly save me the trouble of googling all the various listings under this category and perhaps direct me to the chemicals that can help me achieve this in the shortest amount of time while being (relatively) safe.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please spare me the whole &quot;Just go exercise&quot; spheal-I&#039;m an adult and I&#039;ve already made up my mind I want to do this because I have health problems that doesn&#039;t allow me to do much exercise, but just need help figuring out what would be best suited to my needs.<br /><br />I am a male if that makes any difference.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you in advance, your help is much appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				if you have health problems that prevent you from exercising, doing steroids is definitely not for you. steroids will cause massive hormonal changes in your body that will only be beneficial if you exercise at least once a day, every day, and eat a very nutritious diet. people who do steroids and don&#039;t exercise invariably develop large deposits of fat. all that hormone has to go somewhere, after all. if you don&#039;t exercise much when you&#039;re on steroids, your metabolism will slow and your liver will struggle to eliminate the harmful chemicals (if you choose the oral route of administration, that is). injected steroid has a host of other problems that comes with it. you should really specify what your health condition is that prevents you from exercising. most bodybuilders will not recommend even the lightest prehormone to someone that does not already exercise daily. taking prehormones and steroids without training for at least a month beforehand can cause asymmetrical muscle development and exaggerated bone growth, and the rapid increase of weight is likely to damage your connective tissue. i strongly recommend you train beforehand using only protein and perhaps creatine + glutamine to supplement before even considering taking prohormones or steroids. i cannot, in good faith, recommend any specific chemicals to someone with no weight-lifting experience as it is likely to cause damage. i have seen it many times before, and in some cases the damage was irreversible.<br /><br />experience: chemist and bodybuilder

				ah, lung problems should not cause you any extra health difficulties then. however, you must keep in mind that you will need to be exercising at least 5 days a week and eating at least 5000 calories a day, so complete sobriety is a must. there are a lot of considerations. any chemicals that affect androgen&#039;s conversion into estrogen and testosterone must be completely avoided. an example is alcohol, which causes androgen to convert about 10% more into estrogen. this will give you what some call bitch tits. all bodybuilders will tell you that when cycling, you should not have even one drink. it&#039;ll fuck up your liver and your hormones. with regards to the necessary chemicals, i will give you three recommendations. the first and obvious one is a prohormone of your choice. most of them are qualitatively similar, but you definitely want to go with a mild prohormone as opposed to a more potent steroid for your first cycle. read through this thread: http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=110078581&amp;page=1<br />next, you&#039;re going to need an estrogen blocker and a PCT (post-cycle therapy). the reason for this is that prohormones are chemicals which cause your body itself to produce more androgen and sometimes HGH. male steroids, on the other hand, are chemicals which mimic testosterone and HGH. when taking prohormones, your body produces more androgen which is subsequently converted to more estrogen and more testosterone than normal. ideally, you want your body to only produce more testosterone, so an estrogen blocker is necessary to block the conversion from androgen to estrogen. this means that the androgen boosting prohormone will produce mostly testosterone, which causes increased muscle and bone growth. the post-cycle therapy is usually a cocktail of chemicals that will help your liver to recover since prohormones are mostly oral supplements, meaning they must pass through your liver before reaching your bloodstream. it is for this reason that i don&#039;t recommend taking either prohormones or steroids. steroids have potentially dangerous effects on your hairline and sexual organs, as well as the hormone-producing glands of your body, while prohormones have less significant effects of this type but can cause liver damage. milk-thistle supplementation is a must (its an herb you can get any health foods store) if you are considering oral prohormones. personally, i don&#039;t recommend either. i have gained over 65 pounds of lean, balanced, healthy muscle in just a year without taking any steroids or prohormones. in fact, i have never taken either one before, but nearly all of my peers have. they believe that they need it in order to become bigger, but this is not the case. your body is quite capable of producing huge levels of testosterone on its own depending on your diet and lifestyle. cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs are certainly not gonna put you in the right direction though :P you can easily research the proper diet regimen to boost your testosterone levels, but remember the only way to ever get bigger is to exercise and eat a LOT of protein. the muscle doesn&#039;t come from nowhere, after all. you have to build it out of the material that you fill your body with. you won&#039;t gain a pound of muscle without eating at least 5 pounds of food. there are lots of supplements you can take to naturally increase your body&#039;s production of these hormones, and they will have no harmful side effects. you may really regret taking steroids or prohormones when you notice your hairline receding or your testicles growing smaller. these effects are of course irreversible in most cases, so think before you act. and if these things don&#039;t work for you, you can always get what many clinical doctors give patients with low testosterone levels: testosterone gel. it is a safer alternative to IM testosterone, and won&#039;t damage your liver.
