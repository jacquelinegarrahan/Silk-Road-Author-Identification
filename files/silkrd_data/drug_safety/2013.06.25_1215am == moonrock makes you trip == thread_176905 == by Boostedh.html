				My friend came over this morning and was wide awake from last night.&nbsp; He rushed to me to ask maybe I know what he might&#039;ve taken.&nbsp; He described it as a yellowish moonrock.&nbsp; Said his dealer sold it to him as &quot;molly&quot;.&nbsp; He said it wasn&#039;t an intense roll, but he felt as if he was rolling.&nbsp; After a few hours, 2-3, he said the roll felt like it was subsiding, and he started tripping.&nbsp; Walls breathing, having some melting, and said he could see everything vibrating like energy waves.&nbsp; Said the trip went on for about 4 hours total.&nbsp; Said he was seeing spots and those spots would be on everything,&nbsp; and the traces were feet long.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone ever heard of a research chemical that maybe could do that to a person?&nbsp; He&#039;s going to try to get a little more to bring over.&nbsp; I plan on taking a picture as soon as he does to upload.&nbsp;

				Those effects sound like MDA to me. I got those type of visuals from MDA earlier this week. I greatly underestimated the stuff in it&#039;s psychedelic effects and just how different it is from MDMA (it&#039;s an awesome experience, just take care not to take too much or redose).<br />I&#039;ve seen an amber moonrock version of MDA listed recently. Seems most likely. Best to do a triple reagent test if you can. <br /><br />

				That&#039;s what Im hoping to be able to do as soon as he gets some more.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of anything doing that.&nbsp; I hate street &quot;molly&quot;&nbsp; its such bullshit.

				He said he did about 1 gram in 4-5 hours.&nbsp; Whats the dosages on MDA?&nbsp; I thought it was supposed to be so potent you&#039;re not supposed to be able to do that much?

				He said he didn&#039;t have many side effects...Just that kept him awake for almost 3 days and the trippy part.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of anyone of tripping off any moon rocks.&nbsp; Its like a yellowish rock....has lite white dust just a little on all the rocks.&nbsp; No powder in the bags or anything.

				MDA is very slightly trippy, but still hallucinogenic.&nbsp; the hallucinations manifest most for me during the come down from the drug.&nbsp; during the last 2 or so hours things start to move around, but the beginning hours i cant stop dancing so...yeah...haha.&nbsp; otherwise MDA - A - for amphetamine, is incredibly speedy, almost so much that it is overwhelming.&nbsp; jaws will flap all night long to a nice jeffery dose.&nbsp; MDA is very blurry, and includes nice tracer effects on lights, and has a very warm feeling associated with it.&nbsp; MY favorite is to take MDMA and MDA in combination, in (.075 MDA / .10 MDMA) dosage. Too much MDA and you will not be able to see, stand up straight, or do anything but be couch locked (in the MOST fantastic way possible i would imagine)&nbsp; so beware, less is more with this stuff.&nbsp; I had a friend take .05 and roll pleasantly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This is great for a festival for its prolonged activity.&nbsp; Which would explain why your friend said he was rolling for days after.&nbsp; &nbsp;i only dosed once that night and i was rolling harder and longer than ever before.&nbsp; You said he took .2 so that would make someone roll for a very long time afterwards.&nbsp; .2 is very high dose for MDA, and especially the MDA naive individual.&nbsp; there is no cross tolerance.<br />&nbsp; MDA makes you incredibly talkative, and empathogenic.&nbsp; honestly if you were given MDA as MDMA consider yourself lucky.&nbsp; you could have gotten much much worse.&nbsp; MDA is much harder to come by than MDMA, and usually more expensive in my history with it.&nbsp; MDA has become my new favorite.&nbsp; Do be careful with MDA though, its hngovers are harder and longer than MDMA.&nbsp; pre and post, and take your god damn time! the magic is amazing.SO SAD TO SEE THE ILF GOOOO!!!!!
