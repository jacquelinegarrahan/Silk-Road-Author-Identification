				Hello,<br />Recently just mixed these 2 together and had an awesome time. SWIM took about 300mgs of methylone (tryed smaller dose before and it didn&#039;t work at all) at 22:30 started feeling the rush &amp; euphoria about 23:30. Was supposed to walk into a party right after SWIM bombed the M1 but the party ended up being busted. Drove to the city with a few others who took methylone (a little less) and just speed (more than SWIM). Speed was taken about 23:45 but could only feel minor effects after 00:30. Speed came on slow but increased the energy in my M1 high and seemed to blend nicely. Other than a pretty fast heart-rate, very very dry mouth and jaw clamping/chewing on gum, it was a great experience and I would recommend it. Walked around the city for a while in a really good mood smiling and talking to almost everyone. Most of you would probably insufflate speed, but i find it works better + longer if taken orally. About 02:30, the methylone kind of faded away but was still wired from speed and can&#039;t stop moving!<br /><br />Considering buying a scale so I could do this more often at some better-measured amounts.<br />Cheers all,
