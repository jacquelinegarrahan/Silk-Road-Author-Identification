				So I got some H, apparently great stuff, and I&#039;ve tried it several times by several methods and I always end up feeling just TERRIBLE from it. No euphoria, pleasure, or warmth, just a feeling of gross apathy and a desire to lie still and do nothing at all. If I get up too quick I feel nauseous and need to throw up, and also I have trouble focusing and maintaining balance. I&#039;ve snorted, smoked, and plugged it, but the effect is overall not very nice at all.<br /><br />I think maybe there is a &quot;twinge&quot; of some nice feeling, but it&#039;s buried somewhere under the gross feeling. The powder I got is actually really, really strong, I seriously only need the smallest bit for an effect. It is from Nucleo, if anyone is interested.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.

				Maybe H isn&#039;t for you buddy. Maybe you should try a 30mg oxy and see how that affects you? I&#039;d snort only a quarter (7.5mg) though if it&#039;s your first.

				*exactly* the same for me. opiates always made me feel shitty and nauseous. My opiate loving buddies told me it sometimes takes a few times to get over that and get into it, but i never wanted to &quot;get into it&quot; - I know my personality type, lol. So I&#039;ve just tried single goes multiple times over the years, and always with the same results......perhaps its a blessing in disguise.

				Lower dose, maybe? Sometimes with opiates, less is more, especially when you&#039;re just starting out. There&#039;s a sweet spot you should be looking for -- too little and the effects are weak, too much and you feel nauseous and fucked up (not in a good way). Start out small and slowly work your way up until you find the dose that works. Dosing too high will only make you sick and drive up your tolerance way too fast. Remember: you can always redose if the the effects are too weak.<br /><br />Opiates can be an acquired taste. They can have a lot of unpleasant side effects for the naive user, but with time your body will build tolerance to the bad effects (hopefully a lot sooner than for the good effects).

				In my honest opinion, as someone who vends opiates, I also agree that opiates are somewhat of an acquired taste. I think that the side effects caused by them are only relevant if you take them for a very short period of time. If you learn to enjoy their effects, they can be considered a godsend.<br /><br />Although opiates may cause great euphoria, I still only condone using them sparingly as they are obviously known to be quite addictive to people that are susceptible to it. <br /><br />I like opiates, just not every day... always use responsibly&nbsp; :)

				Didn&#039;t read posts but i&#039;m sure this has already been said. Lower your dose. Opiates for me are my drug of choice, for you it may not be. But heroin is nothing like your prescription pill, much stronger than oxy 80&#039;s. you should only start out with a small line of a tenth, that is if you&#039;re not used to the euphoria, after that first hour or so on it in my experience you can do a few more lines that size, it wont intensify the feeling, just drag it out. Or you could just not use it at all. But for me, i love to snort a few lines and just chill in my room for the night.

				I cant even feel opiates.. except smoking fenytnyl.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big promoter of the idea that everybody is different, and that drugs should only be taken if you need them (the definition of need is up to the user of course) If you don&#039;t like it, it doesnt mean anythings wrong,just not for you.

				i&#039;ve noticed that people who like coke usu. don&#039;t like H.&nbsp; Or any opiate.&nbsp; The reverse is generally true as well.&nbsp; Opiate lovers don&#039;t like coke.&nbsp; That being said, SWIM likes both.&nbsp; Alot.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; but more h than c.&nbsp; &quot;H&amp;C...pure cane sugar...la la la....&quot;&nbsp; Anyway, I think there&#039;s two kinds of people usually with a very small minority that like both like SWIM.&nbsp; But since you don&#039;t like H, try some C.&nbsp; U&#039;ll prob love it.

				You definitely need to lower your dose. If you feel sick any time you move you have done WAY too much. Try cutting your dose in half, then see how you feel. The opiate high can be very subtle, it is not oppressive like a weed or stimulant high -- it is &quot;pleasantly underlying&quot; rather than &quot;take charge&quot;. If you are at the right dose you should be able to have a conversation with someone without them noticing, except maybe because of your incessant chattering!

				I Only ever tied H from SilkRoad (2X now).&nbsp; Before that I had done Percocet/Oxy &amp; Roxi&#039;s.&nbsp; Granted the BEST was Roxi.&nbsp; But having said that, I DID get a pleasurable euphoria off the (1/10 - REMEMBER this was my FIRST and 2ND ONLY EVER), but I had a great feeling of euphoria.<br /><br />I guess it may depend on the seller your getting from [Most on SR quote around 70-80% potency}<br /><br />Hard to say from just reading your post, but I&#039;d suggest trying a ROXI not a OXY, as I had a MUCH greater time with the former.

				Opiates are not euphoric.<br /><br />The schools, the police, TV have brainwashed us into thinking that opiates are pleasurable.<br /><br />
