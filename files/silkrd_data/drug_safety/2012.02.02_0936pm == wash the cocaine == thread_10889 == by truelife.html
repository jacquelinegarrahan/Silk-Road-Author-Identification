				I think usually an acetone wash is used, but there are still some things the wash won&#039;t be able to remove. Do some looking around, and you&#039;ll find topics on this very subject.

				This is a more complicated procedure that it first sounds.&nbsp; I have been studying this in depth recently.<br /><br />An acetone wash is often used but that will only remove non-polar compounds and since acetone has water in it you will lose a portion of your cocaine while doing it.<br /><br />Worse, the active cuts (amphetamines, ephedrine) aren&#039;t removed by this process.&nbsp; &nbsp; The way i&#039;m looking to remove these is to rebase, and while in base form filter these out using a solvent which dissolves these but not base cocaine (water), then to reformultate back into the hydrochloride derivitive.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if that sounds like greek, it was to me at first.&nbsp; I have done a lot of studying and I&#039;ve had to have some professional tutoring to understand.&nbsp; Unfortunately it is more complicated than it sounds.<br />

				I was told to put coke in a spoon and add ammonia, mix , and heated with a lighter.... so the cut evaporates, and remains pure coke, is this possible?

				research I did, but it comes too complicated methods, which are good for large amounts ... I&#039;m looking for an easy way for small amounts, if anyone knows a simple way would be great<br /><br />hey White Light peace ;)
