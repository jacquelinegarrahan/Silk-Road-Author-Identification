				Hey all, it&#039;s about time I come up with another ambitious thread because I&#039;m lazy. <br /><br />So I like my drugs and I have poor memory and I hate trying to remember numbers and chemistry and harm reduction and I can&#039;t find anything on SR (and I hate trudging through clearnet shit) that sums up, as succinctly as possible, harm reduction for my favorite drugs. Stuff like WHY is meth neurotoxic? What receptors/transmitters are being taxed? What about for opiates? What should I take to offset this shit? I want the science behind it but I don&#039;t want to have to read through thirty pages, pick the small bits of useful/non-redundant information out and be so exhausted by the end of the read that I forget it all because I didn&#039;t know I was going to be quizzed after my 4-hours of reading (where quizzing would be using drugs, of course). <br /><br />So I&#039;d like people to tell me what they know about drugs, specifically (meth)amphetamines and opiates but we can move on once we have some basic/detailed information for every aspect of these two drug categories. If there&#039;s already an easy-access place on here for this information, call me a stupid fucker and give me a link because I can&#039;t find it and even the stickied meth link, while helpful, is still lengthy and then there&#039;s a million posts after that which may or may not provide any useful/accurate information.<br /><br />So please post the facts of these drugs (with sources, if you got them) and I&#039;ll handle compiling them into an easily digestible format. That way, if someone comes by and checks on this, someone can easily see all the information they may want as well as easily seeing any claims I&#039;m posting that are inaccurate and challenge them. <br /><br />Anyways, I ramble, so on to my fledgling information regarding meth and heroin. Everything else in the amphetamine/opiate realm is fair game! Does speed have different Bioavailability? Chime in and I&#039;ll add it? Oxycodone work way different than heroin (hint: yes)? Tell me how! <br /><br /><br />METHAMPHETAMINE:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Source &lt;CLEARNET &gt;&gt; http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/21/4/717.abstract&gt; <br /><br />Meth Bioavailability:<br /><br />Oral: 67.2 +/- 3.1%<br />Nasal: 79%<br />Smoked: 90.3 +/- 10.4%<br />Rectal: 99%<br />IV: 100% <br /><br /><br />Using above bioavailabilities can help with this info stolen from the meth sticky for therapeutic/recreational use:<br /><br />Here&#039;s the schedule a beginner should follow for daily productive use and to prevent neurotoxicity (Assuming 99% bioavailability. Adjust dosages for your ROA bioavailability):<br /><br />Therapeutic Use:<br /><br />Days 1-7: 0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;0.5mg/kg for males, &lt;0.25mg/kg for females<br />No more than once a day<br /><br />For recreational use:<br /><br />Days 1-7:0.15mg/kg<br />Days 8-?: &lt;1.0mg/kg for males, &lt;0.5mg/kg for females<br />No more than once every 3-4 days<br /><br />&quot;The geometric mean plasma half-life was 11.1 hr for smoked methamphetamine and 12.2 hr for the intravenous drug.&quot;<br /><br />&lt;From Sticky&gt;<br /><br />Tolerance should be back to baseline after 5 half-lives or three days (97% of meth will be purged from system by then). (From above information, 72 hours would be closer to 6 half-lives with 99% of meth gone).<br /><br />Any persisting tolerance after 5 days was caused by striatal DA depletionsas well as downregulation of D2 receptors (needs clarification)<br /><br /><br />Supplements/Drugs that help keep your body healthy: <br /><br />Vitamin C (antioxidant)<br />Vitamin E (antioxidant)<br />Magnesium (slows down acute tolerance + extends high due to NMDA antagonist) <br />Nicotinamide/Niacinamide (also can take Niacin) --take three hours prior or 6 hours after dosing to reduce energy depletion (ATP/ADP)<br /><br />EXERCISE -- take it easy if you&#039;re doing large doses but definitely helps with neurotoxicity when taking low doses. <br /><br />Weed (How it helps may be correlational but extremely unlikely it will hurt)<br />Benzodiazepenes (during comedown--may help with neurotoxicity) -- Needs source. Likely correlational due to help inducing sleep.<br /><br />Things to AVOID that keep your body healthy:<br /><br />Caffeine (slows removal of meth from body [bad!] and increases neurotoxicity by antagonizing adenosine receptors) -- needs source. <br /><br /><br />Message with Brain info and Meth that I&#039;m currently working through (needs sources) http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.msg489747#msg489747<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Heroin (diacetylmorphine) Bioavailability:<br /><br />Oral: &lt;35%<br />Smoked: 44-61%<br />IV: 100%

				experience - methamphetamine combined with benzodiazepines in a speedball intravenous shot is better than meth combined with heroin. Also if you inject methamphetamine instead of having energy you just lay on your bed wasting time.. that&#039;s personal experience.
