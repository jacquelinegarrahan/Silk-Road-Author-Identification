				Title: <strong>Question about MDMA+2C-B combo</strong><br />

				I&#039;ve a question regarding the combination of MDMA and 2C-B, based on my recent experience. It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve combined the two and I think I didn&#039;t get to the whole thing. I guess this was based to these factors: first, because I did acid (210ug) the day before and (correct me I&#039;m wrong) there&#039;s cross-tolerance between LSD and 2C-B. Second, because of timing.<br /><br />I took 120mg of MDMA and another 40mg around T+1:30. My intention was to take 20mg of 2C-B at the first signal of the MDMA fading away. But I think I took it later than I should (around T+4:00). I crash from the MDMA and maybe half an hour later I started to feel something coming up. My partner and I went to the camping (we were in a music festival) with the intention of ending the night there experiencing the synergy of the drug but we only had mild effects. Some CEV and a very nice sleepy feeling that led us to a great sleep. But nothing more.<br /><br />The night was amazing, whatever the 2C-B did to us was great and the whole weekend has been a truly purifying experience. But I guess there&#039;s something else to be explored in the relation between this substances so I&#039;d like a little enlightenment from you experienced travelers. What were our mistakes?<br /><br />Thank you verrry much, I put a lot of thought on how great this community is.

				Well you definitely had a tolerance from the LSD the day before, and that diminished the effects of 2C-B. Had you timed the 2C-B properly (usually around T+90) than you wouldn&#039;t have crashed from the MDMA and instead would have gently transitioned/extended your peak. I would recommend not redosing the MDMA and changing your timing of the 2C-B dosage and not having a tolerance to psychedelics and you should have a great night. Glad to hear it was good anyway though!

				I&#039;m kind of surprised that you crashed from the MDMA before the 2C-B brought you up based on that schedule.&nbsp; It does take the 2C-B 45min or so to come up.&nbsp; I guess maybe plan to take the 2C-B a little earlier next time.<br /><br />Next time I take 2C-B I hope to take 30mg or more.&nbsp; I generally find 20mg orally to not last as long as it should.

				Thanks for your replies! I&#039;ll do it properly next time the occasion comes. MDMA is one of my dearest drugs and I want to find the way of having the smoothest (and interesting) comedown possible. I&#039;ve to try it with GHB too. For the time being I&#039;ll let my serotonin receptors rest.

				Your protocol was actually pretty accurate IMHO. It&#039;s a little strange that your MDMA was over so quick, especially with the 40mg bump at T:130. I would expect pretty minor tolerance from the acid - some for sure, but not a lot, as 2C-B&#039;s a phenethylamine and LSD&#039;s an indole.<br /><br />Shulgin&#039;s recommendation re the timing of 2C-B in relation to MDMA is &quot;at or near baseline&quot; and I have to say I agree. Too early on and something is lost. Seems you were perhaps around 30 mins late this time. 20mg of 2C-B should also have been quite adequate to re-invigorate the MDMA quite strongly. 30mg (generally) might be more trip than you might want at that point.<br /><br />If you&#039;re wanting to experiment with GHB as a transitioning agent too then there is a thread here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90975.0 about that. Also some refs there to the LSD + MDMA + 2C-B + GHB combo (one of the sweetest ever!)...<br /><br />BG

				LSD and 2C-B shouldn&#039;t cause much of a tolerance per say, but the intensity of the experience could have caused you to feel it less maybe.<br /><br />Timing seems about correct, but the roll was pretty short. You sure it wasn&#039;t M1?

				I think the shortness of the roll had a lot to do with the setting. It was MDMA, no doubt about it, maybe the best I ever had (first one I&#039;ve got from SR, from chemical brothers). The thing is the roll was fucking amazing not just because of the drug but also because of the INCREDIBLE concert we were at. This has happened to me a couple of times before: I&#039;m immersed in the fuckin&#039; concert of my life rolling and loving everything and everyone... and suddenly is over. The musicians go away... the MDMA suffers from it. The comedown hits me harder than other times where the fun has been something less dependent on an event (I have comedowns pretty smooth and easy to handle on those occasions). <br /><br />Apart from that, I get the effects of the 2C-B (I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s this one in particular or the substance in general) around T+1:30. I did 20mg a couple of months before with the same capsules and I loved it, it put me right were I wanted to be (I found 20mg to be a perfect dosage for me) so I know the quality is great (purchased from subtickle). Maybe I get the effects a little late compared to other people (or it&#039;s because of this 2C-B in particular, or maybe because it was in capsule-form) and I should have anticipated it.<br /><br />Another factor that comes to my mind is degradation from heat. The capsules were deep into my car&#039;s trunk which was exposed to a full-throttle sun for a day and a half. Maybe that could&#039;ve been another mistake.<br /><br />I plan to try the combo again in two months, I really want to get it right. About the GHB combo I definitely want to try it, but first I have to experiment with GHB which I&#039;ve never taken. I&#039;m really looking forward to it, but BlueGiraffe&#039;s smallest listing is too much money for me (and I don&#039;t want to buy from anybody else) and there&#039;s a couple of other new-for-me substances I have higher up in my list. But an MDMA+GHB combo is something I kinda know I&#039;m gonna fall in love with. Call it intuition.<br /><br />Again, thanks for the replies. Next time I&#039;ll aim to do it right!

The shift in a few mg can be drastic. I once snorted an eyeballed (HUGE MISTAKE) 25mg (probably was more) and thought I had fried my mind for good. I could not see because the world broke into fractals and trails. It was simultaneously amazing and terrifying. It was Greenpeas shit so you know how badass it is. An hour in and I felt like a god, luckily I didn&#039;t panic. I kept reminding myself that out of the 2C class is had the best safety record and I had no tachycardia after the initial fear subsided. Now I am experimenting with low 10-12 mg oral doses. VERY therapeutic in a way MDMA can&#039;t be. I can be around sober people with ease. Puts me in my body in ways that make yoga amazing. With MDMA I wait until near baseline as per &lt;3 Schulgin &lt;3.
