				Okay so I&#039;m somewhat of an LSD veteran (I&#039;ve taken over 100 tabs in my life). I&#039;m looking to expand my horizons and try some shrooms. What dosage would be equivalent to one tab of good LSD (at least 100mcg)? Would this be a good first dose or would I be okay to have way more since I&#039;ve handled multiple tabs or are the experiences too different so I need to start from the bottom like when I first tried LSD?

				Start slow with mushrooms, even though you are experienced with LSD they are different drugs and give different experiences. Some people who love LSD become uncomfortable on shrooms (and vice versa!). Shrooms are known for having a &quot;weirder&quot; feeling to them than LSD. I would start with around 2 grams for your first trip and work up from there.

				check out the Shroomery :)<br /><br />shrooms will latch onto your mental processes slightly differently than LSD so be prepared for that, you should bring your curiosity.&nbsp; it&#039;s a very heady trip.<br /><br />i had done shrooms over 100 times before trying LSD and got my shit scrambled a few times because of it.&nbsp; i was just trying to fit it into a mold that it wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; so my suggestion would be to go into it like it&#039;s a brand new experience to you, regardless of any LSD experience.<br /><br />start with no more than 2 grams, no less than 1.5.&nbsp; &nbsp;or you might like to check out 4-AcO-DMT (Psilacetin) which is a compound analagous to one of the psychoactives in mushrooms (Psilocin - 4-HO-DMT).&nbsp; some say it&#039;s essentially the same experience without much nausea and other weird uncomfortable bodily sensations.

				I use LSD but tried galindoi powder which I hear is maybe 1/3 weaker than regular mushrooms.&nbsp; I made tea out of it.&nbsp; My friend and I went through 11g so about 5.5g each.&nbsp; To be honest we were pretty disappointed with the short duration.&nbsp; I ended up getting horrid nausea.&nbsp; How the hell do so many people take mushrooms at festivals I have no idea.<br /><br />One thing that is cool about shrooms that is different from LSD is that redosing is far more effective.&nbsp; So maybe make some tea and start slow but work your way up.

				I started with shrooms and learned a lot but when I&nbsp; took lsd for the first time I never wanted to eat shrooms again.<br /><br />I think that on lsd you keep more control over your mind and stuff. While with mushrooms you&#039;re more being pushed into things...<br /><br />There are probably a lot of mushroom growers on SR that can help you.<br />If they can not then I would recommend virmo. They can get whatecer truffels (I think they suck), but also dried powdered hawaiian mushrooms. I used to love those. And since it&#039;s dried you can put it in capsules, drop them like bombs, cover them in yoghurt etc to make it less disgusting to ingest...<br /><br />If you decide to take mushrooms I wish you a very fun, sinsightful etc journey!&nbsp; 8)

				All good advice here, one thing not to forget is be comfortable in your setting.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you would give that same advice for a first time LSD user.&nbsp; Might be easy to forget that since you are more comfortable with LSD.
