				Is it possible to binge on mushrooms? Let&#039;s say my initial dose is 4g&#039;s could I eat a gram or so every hour or so? <br />Would that prolong my trip? Is it worth it? we&#039;ll be having about an OZ of &#039;shrooms.&nbsp;

				eating more mushrooms will extend the trip but won&#039;t intensify the experience... it would just be wasteful. why would you want to binge on mushrooms anyway? you would most likely regret it afterwards.

				I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s wasteful so long as it&#039;s the desired effect. I&#039;ll sometimes re-dose on shrooms if I&#039;m not done with the trip. Never done such small, regular doses, though.<br /><br />Both on shrooms and on LSD, though, you have to gauge desired intensity with the initial dose, as it&#039;s not going to change. Taking more because you want a more powerful trip would be a waste, because you&#039;re not gonna get it.

				In my experience, it is actually pretty difficult, due to the diminishing returns. If you trip two days in a row on mushies, expect to double up on yesterdays dose. Waiting a week is better.<br /><br />You basically end up shoveling more and more mushrooms into yourself in order to satisfy a need that the mushrooms themselves will never succeed in doing. It is the psychedelic equivalent of cutting your nose off to spite your face.<br /><br />YMMV though. Namaste.

				It is possible, but it gets expensive quick due to tolerance building like others have said. Day after day tripping with diminishing returns can still be cleansing for the spirit if you can handle it. I recently realized that I am not in a position to handle three or four day psychedelic binges the way I once could. It can put you in either a wonderful place or an extremely dark place. So before extended binging, please make sure you are emotionally ready to handle whatever ride the mystic forces are going to take you on!

				I don&#039;t want to binge but I have a similar question!&nbsp; <br /><br />I tripped yesterday around this time, ate about 2 grams.&nbsp; I wanna know if I eat three grams today or maybe double that amount, would I have a trip?<br /><br />I know it would probably be better to wait at least a couple days but that&#039;s easier said than done!

				experimented with this last weekend.. me and my buddy each doesd 2g&#039;s then another 2g&#039;s one hour later, then another 4g each 45 minutes after that. made for a good long trip and we can both highly recommend dosing this way.

				i highly recommend eating 7g up front.&nbsp; its totally, utterly magical.&nbsp; and i think mushroom tripping gets easier when you take higher doses like that.<br /><br />seriously.&nbsp; its fucking awesome

				man, i could go on and on about how i thought i naild down what to expect from the experience, but just when you think you&#039;ve seen it all BOOM all kinds of new shit. lol...&nbsp; for example, i must of tripped 8 times before i could see full color memory&#039;s with my eyes closed. open my eyes be back in my room. close them and be back in&nbsp; memory like it was real life... <br /><br />on another note, you can do them over and over in a short time but the euphoria that you are probably getting now wears off and its just intense and uncomfortable.. then you take a few months off... so live it up while its fun!!&nbsp; <br /><br />you need 3.5 on an empty stomach for a &quot;real&quot; dose.. but you will trip efin hard...

				i forgot to mention... have fun experimenting but the way to go is eat it all at once... get it over and on your way... it will not last much longer spreading it out over the night but will drastically effect how high your peak is and how deep you can get...&nbsp; its not like E trying to pace your self.. you wanna ride the roller coaster it naturally gives from doing it all at once..

Some years ago we harvested a couple of kilos of mushrooms and the most ardent fan of stuffing his face with them clearly got the least return for his effort.<br />It takes a while for the serotonin homeostasis to re-establish, and years later we all found ourselves ruing the decision to stand idly by while someone wasted the harvest during a time of plenty.<br /><br />It was educational.

				Binging on shrooms is impossible.<br /><br />Once you trip and the 6 hours are up, finished!<br /><br />Wait another 7-14 days for the tolerance to diminish, hence why you can;t get addicted to mushrooms or LSD.

People generally find it quite different to the first time, and it&#039;s quite difficult for most people to get to the state that we&#039;d generally accept as tripping, but redosing has had an effect on the dozens of people I&#039;ve seen do it. It&#039;s just not the same as taking the first dose.<br /><br />

				Within the 6 (to 8 ) hours, you&#039;re good to extend, though. Re-dosing after you&#039;ve come down is probably a lost cause, but re-dosing during the trip is certainly effective at keeping a solid trip going.
