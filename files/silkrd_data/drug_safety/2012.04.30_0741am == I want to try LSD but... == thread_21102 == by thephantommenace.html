				I have two main concerns.<br /><br />First one is ordering it through the mail. How likely is it that it could be intercepted by police? I only want to try it once. I don&#039;t considered myself a drug user. I stay away from all the addicting crap and have only smoked weed a few times.&nbsp; I&#039;m not using it for pleasure or socializing.&nbsp; I only want to try LSD to see if it&#039;ll enhance my creativity for the music and art I create. But getting arrested would be very bad.<br /><br />My second main concern is having a bad trip.&nbsp; I read a lot about this online and some people make it sound really scary. When I smoked weed with friends I did not have a very good experience because I&#039;m not a social person and I felt a lot of paranoia and anxiety after smoking it. So I know if I try LSD I have to avoid other people since they make me uncomfortable. But I&#039;m concerned too that I just might not have the personality that is good for this.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty cynical and I have a dark imagination and hate just about everybody. I do want to feel positive about my LSD experience, though. I want to imagine it like I&#039;m going on a trip to meet my muse and he&#039;s going to give me the information I need to make great music.

				The chances of being caught out delivered LSD are just insanely low.<br />Plus, you never ordered anything, right?

				Hey :)<br /><br />I am quite new to using LSD (3 times in the past months). I read *a lot* about it, Erowid, Stan Grof&#039;s books, Hofmann&#039;s &quot;Problem Child&quot;. These are my .02:<br /><br />ad 2: Usually bad trips happen in an environment where your needs and feelings are not respected. That explains why testpersons in the 50s and 60s freaked out so much: They were in sterile clinical environments, dominated by machines and apparatuses.<br />If you feel comfortable in your room/outside where you are going to take the LSD, you should be fine. Avoid any stress situations: School, Police, large groups of people you do not know.<br /><br />get a trip sitter. someone you like/trust.<br /><br />good luck :)

				I think a better question is, what do you NOT do while tripping?<br /><br />Seriously, LSD is without a doubt the most life-changing experience I have ever had in my life. I&#039;ve never felt so connected to....well..just about everything! The clarity I have while on acid is unbelievable, I can recall taking walks through the park and being able to sense just about everything around me. The sky, the trees, even people&#039;s voices from across the park can be felt. I recommend you buy a longboard and just roll through the streets while jamming out to some Jimi Hendrix or Led Zeppelin, because it will blow your freaking mind! Hell, even doing everyday tasks can be a memorable experience while under the influence of LSD. My favorite things to do on acid all relate to nature though. Hiking is most certainly breathtaking, so you might want to get some friends to join you and just start walking. Playing Frisbee with my dog by the lake has been fun too. Oh, and while on the topic of animals, I can just sit there for hours with nothing else other than my cats and a few different colored laser pointers.<br /><br />I can ramble on forever about the fun things to do on LSD, but you probably get the point already. You don&#039;t even have to do anything on acid, you can easily just sit in a dark room and meditate while hallucinations spiral around your head and the walls breathe down your neck. It doesn&#039;t make much difference to me, either way I&#039;ve never had a bad trip while chilling with my pal Lucy. ;)

				very likely not going to get caught with it- everything these guys are saying is true.&nbsp; Ive always found when a trip starts going sour its because im uncomfortable with the situation im in.&nbsp; As long as im in a place where i feel i have control and around people i feel comfortable with it has been amazing.&nbsp; I had a bad trip once when i got lost in the woods and then it became incredbily dark and i didnt have a flashlight, then once i got out of the woods i got chased by a security gaurd who kept trying to steal my weed- that day sucked until i calmed down then it was kick ass.&nbsp; LSD goes in waves- you&#039;ll have moments where your like holy fuckk and just laugh your ass off and as long as you keep your cool during the wave youll be relaxed and be able to enjoy the trip.<br /><br />Honestly i wouldnt worry about it, be around good people and you&#039;ll be good- dont be alone or look in the mirror too much (idk sometimes that weirds me out i get stuck in the bathroom like what in the fuckkk) <br /><br />Just ease your mind and do it- youll love it

				lsd is by far the easiest drug to send through the mail... don&#039;t worry about that. and get all this &quot;bad trip&quot; nonsense out of your head. thinking about having a &quot;bad trip&quot; will likely give you a bad trip. just let lucy show you what you need to see. remember the words &quot;no resistance&quot; and everything will be fine. start out with 1 or 2 tabs if you&#039;re still nervous. most importantly, make sure you&#039;re in a positive state of mind and a comfortable environment.

You already put in motion the negative thinking that causes bad trips. My point is, if you are that worried about it, for your own sake, don&#039;t do it yet. Now I&#039;ve smoked my DMT, experienced mushrooms from ego death to heaven to just a plan funny Saturday night. LSD is no joke man. I know other people eat that shit like peanuts and what not, but to me LSD is just too plain fucking WEIRD. I mean, my friends were saying the most weirdest, random shit I could never have thought of sober. HOWEVER, I do LOVE the visuals and the AWESOME cerebral buzz you get.<br /><br />Dude, I&#039;m just gonna say it. You&#039;re not ready, and honestly I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;re on Silk Road. No offense, but are you a minor at all? Seriously, you&#039;re actually talking about weed like it&#039;s a hardcore drug. Wait a few more years and wait until you get some courage or sense of self.&nbsp; Going from weed to REAL LSD is a HUGE step and you aren&#039;t ready. Hell, I&#039;d done more 5-meo-DMT than LSD when I had my first experience with LSD (Thanks Del Ellis!) I was definitely not ready thanks to the shitty street acid these days. Once you plateau, dear god it&#039;s just fun from there. For me though, I just find some LSD weirdness to be a bit too weird LOL. <br /><br />Oh yeah, LSD made me cry like a baby when I started thinking about a recently deceased relative. LSD is both the destroyer and the savior to me. Be prepared to lose a little but gain a lot. I just wish it didn&#039;t make less tolerant people so weird on it. Want an example. Look up and interview with Butthole Surfers, circa 1984 (or &#039;85?). It&#039;s really funny.

				Lain, there is a reason why Erowid edits experience reports that use &quot;you&quot; instead of &quot;I.&quot; I realize that you describe your trips, which is correct to do, yes, but you are making it sound like he will experience the same with LSD.<br /><br />The truth is that 100ug isn&#039;t by any means a heroic dose... at all. Hell, if OP wanted, he could cut the tab in half and take just 50ug. Or into 3/4. It&#039;s his life. I have a wise friend who says that you are ready to trip when you seek a trip. Sure, he&#039;s probably going to be floored by it, and your concern for him is appreciated, but your admonishing is not.<br /><br />So, that is to say, everyone experiences chemicals differently and just because you find LSD to be weirder than 5-MeO-DMT, or so your post seems to imply (and I apologize if I misunderstood), that doesn&#039;t mean he will. 2C-P is a great example of how some people can take 20mg and have a mild and pleasant trip, and others can take 14mg and spend 24 hours fighting toxicity in a living psychedelic hell. I read a thread a while back where a SR user said 5mg of 2C-B was too intense and weird for him - meanwhile 2C-B didn&#039;t get &quot;weird&quot; until I took upwards of 30mg, and Shulgin recommended a 24mg max. I&#039;m sure you already understood what I&#039;m saying and I sound completely patronizing, but I don&#039;t think I should be any less explicit here because I want OP to have a good time and to enjoy his first trip!<br /><br />Even if he is a minor, let&#039;s just give him constructive advice on how to trip safely and happily, and hopefully he will make a responsible decision and not take acid on a Wednesday night in mom&#039;s basement :)
