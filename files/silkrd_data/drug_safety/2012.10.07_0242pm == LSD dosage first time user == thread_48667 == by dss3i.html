				I&#039;m going to order LSD to use for the first time. I tried discussing dosage with my friends, but it didn&#039;t go over well (many recommendations but no experience/facts to back them up with). I&#039;m thinking of buying from FartBomber or The Flying Dutchman. FartBomber says his Marylin Monroe blotters have been lab tested for 145 micrograms, while The Flying Dutchman says his LSD Blotters are 150 micrograms (no lab testing). Which of these stamps should I expect to be the strongest? I want a strong trip and I am not scared of going into vegetable state for a while. I&#039;d rather overdose a little to make sure I have a strong experience (since there is hardly any risk with overdosing), than take too little and have a weak experience. There&#039;s no point in taking way too much, though, since I&#039;m guessing the experience will no longer be enhanced with a stronger dosage after a certain dosage (the body must have a limited ability to make use of serotonin after all). I&#039;m 17, female and slender, but not super skinny or tiny (I work out several days a week). I know all drugs are different, but usually I feel less than my friends (skinny teenagers) if we take the same dosage of a drug, and I&#039;ve never had a bad trip. My guess is that one of FartBombers 145 micrograms stamps should be a perfect strong first trip for me. What do you think? Would one of The Flying Dutchman&#039;s 150 microgram stamps be just as good? Would taking two 143 or 150 microgram stamps give me a stronger experience or am I likely past the point where it can get stronger (in a good way) already?

				i would recommend you start with 100-200ug.<br /><br />You may want to excercise a little more respect for going into a psychedelic &quot;vegetative state&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever been there, but it&#039;s not a manageable thing.<br /><br />I cannot comment of FartBomber or FlyingDutch&#039;s tabs because I&#039;m in the US, but feel free to check out the LSD Avengers Thread featuring a frequently updated OP!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Happy tripping.<br /><br />---

				I have a second question. Say I have two blotters 120 micrograms each, and I want to take 180 micrograms. Are the LSD molecules so evenly spread out on the paper that I can cut one of my blots in half and eat 1.5 blots to make it 180 micrograms, or not?

				No they aren&#039;t perfectly spread out but you can guesstimate and be confident enough.<br /><br />about 150ug will give you (or me at least) all of the classic traits of tripping balls.<br /><br />---

				I have ordered a 145 microgram blotter! What can I expect from my trip? Will it be enough? I have never taken LSD before and I am super excited. Any cool stuff I should do during it? I have a sitter and we are planning to take a walk in the woods and eat some interesting food. Anything else?

				Before using LSD you should be in a good environment, especially if its your first time. You must be able to trust your source as well or else you wont know how much to dose, which is why it might be a good idea if an experienced tripper tested it first so you could know if the dose is accurate. If so they can tell you a good amount to dose.

				first off, 145 is an odd fucking dose for &#039;cid. it&#039;s probably ~100. If you only have one, and you don&#039;t feel the blastoff your looking for, you can&#039;t add on, so yes my advice is order 2. I have NO experience that I know of with this cat, but doseages are almost always overstated because there is no real way to prove it, so grain of salt. MY first LSD experience was 2 tabs and I wish to this day it had been 3. But I recommend 2. and go with it as far as she takes you :) buy the ticket and take the ride--to quote HST :)

				145 is almost to what I would call a good first trip, but do you trust that it was in fact lab tested? I don&#039;t know that cat or the print he is selling, so I can;t speak, but that part of the world does have a history of exaggerating doseage under the premise of it being &quot;lab tested&quot; because they have labs that do test over there and we don&#039;t have any real way to prove it wrong. buy @ least 2, don&#039;t FE, and trip your clit off if they are advertised correctly, but have a really great time if they are ~100 (which is my guess)

				First Ill just say that I have never tried the doses from the vendor you purchased from so I cant attest to quality. As others have said obtaining an accurate number as far as the dosage is concerned (i.e. 145ug) is for all intents and purposes pretty damn close to impossible though a range is more reasonably attained. Do yourself a favor and buy your doses from VitaCat. His blotters are expertly laid and the actual synth is truly done by a master. The quality surpasses anything else you will find. 1 single Maya blotter (conservatively 200ug) will show you exactly what a real acid trip is. Downside is that when he has stock it literally goes in one day. It runs a little pricey but it is totally worth it. Anyway, if I were you I would drop one dose and wait a half hour see how you feel and drop another half or whole dose. If it takes more than that to trip then the acid you have is not 145ug. A 145ug of lucy should be more than enough for a first trip.

I suspect that blot is in the range 125-155. Maybe someone will be able to review it on the forum before they arrive in my mail box and I will be able to adjust the dose after their recommendations. To be on the safe side, though, and because I&#039;m not too worried about getting a too high dose, I will probably go with both blotters right away if no one reviews that particular blot. LSD has a huge drop in effect in just half an hour I believe, so it seems a bit pointless to take another one thirty minutes later to me.

I tried discussing dosage with my friends, but it didn&#039;t go over well (many recommendations but no experience/facts to back them up with). I&#039;m thinking of buying from FartBomber or The Flying Dutchman. FartBomber says his Marylin Monroe blotters have been lab tested for 145 micrograms, while The Flying Dutchman says his LSD Blotters are 150 micrograms (no lab testing). Which of these stamps should I expect to be the strongest? I want a strong trip and I am not scared of going into vegetable state for a while. I&#039;d rather overdose a little to make sure I have a strong experience (since there is hardly any risk with overdosing), than take too little and have a weak experience. There&#039;s no point in taking way too much, though, since I&#039;m guessing the experience will no longer be enhanced with a stronger dosage after a certain dosage (the body must have a limited ability to make use of serotonin after all). I&#039;m 17, female and slender, but not super skinny or tiny (I work out several days a week). I know all drugs are different, but usually I feel less than my friends (skinny teenagers) if we take the same dosage of a drug, and I&#039;ve never had a bad trip. My guess is that one of FartBombers 145 micrograms stamps should be a perfect strong first trip for me. What do you think? Would one of The Flying Dutchman&#039;s 150 microgram stamps be just as good? Would taking two 143 or 150 microgram stamps give me a stronger experience or am I likely past the point where it can get stronger (in a good way) already?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Id say 100ug

				I took both tabs and it wasn&#039;t enough to meet my expectations. If I could re-dose and re-trip I&#039;d go for 300+ mics. I&#039;m not saying the acid was bad at all, I think FartBomber has had some good reviews of his MM tabs by now, but for me personally 200 mics didn&#039;t take me to any higher truths. There were hallucinations, distortions and forests coming to life, but I want to go further. Will be tripping soon again with an increased dose. I&#039;m thinking 2 MM might be too little, but 3 might be too much. I suppose I&#039;ll be aiming at taking 400 mics my second time. :)

				From what I have read you recommand between 100 and 300 mics for the first trip? I bought 5 blotters with 120 mics from Frank ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/55d204ed63 ).<br /><br />Do you think one blotter is enough for the first time? I&#039;m not experiences with psychos, I only took Shrooms 2 times which a mate of mine grew at his home. I&#039;d wish to have an intense and hopefully perspective changing trip, so I wouldnt want to waste the first time with an unspectular trip. I made the sad experience with MDMA even tho I&#039;ve waited a long time between each trip that the following trip was not as good as the trip before. I do not want to make that mistake with LSD

I bought 5 blotters with 120 mics from Frank ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/55d204ed63 ).<br /><br />Do you think one blotter is enough for the first time? I&#039;m not experiences with psychos, I only took Shrooms 2 times which a mate of mine grew at his home. I&#039;d wish to have an intense and hopefully perspective changing trip, so I wouldnt want to waste the first time with an unspectular trip. I made the sad experience with MDMA even tho I&#039;ve waited a long time between each trip that the following trip was not as good as the trip before. I do not want to make that mistake with LSD<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tolerance is individual. If I were you I would take 3 blotters and go with 360 mics, but I seem to have high tolerance, in spite of never having used psychedelics before. I&#039;d say at least take 2, though, even if your tolerance is low. Don&#039;t take 1 because I suspect that won&#039;t give you a &quot;perspective changing trip.&quot;

If you find it uncomfortable loosing your basic functions, such as not being able to communicate with anyone, you might have a panic attack. Also, higher doses may bring back old unpleasant memories or force you to face unpleasant truths about your life. If your thoughts and feelings really bother you you can change the music, try some food, or go to another room, and you might start thinking about something else, something more pleasant. Having a lot of people around can also be scary while on acid, so you want to be in a safe place and have a bed at hand where you can be alone, without a lot of people running around. Finding it hard to eat is another negative effect while on acid, so eat well before taking the acid. The trick when becoming uncomfortable on acid is to stay calm and remember that it will pass, and you should be okay. I think that most &#039;bad&#039; trips on acid are &#039;unplanned&#039; trips, where people are offered acid at a party and try it without knowing what to expect, and they freak out when they realize they can&#039;t talk/move/eat, and a lot of unfamiliar distorted faces are partying all around them. If you feel that you really can&#039;t handle a trip a last way out is to take some benzos, because they work as an antidote. It might give you a sense of security to keep some laying around. <br /><br />

When you are experienced you may know which dose you can handle on your own, but the first time it is important to know someone will help you if you aren&#039;t feeling well. <br /><br />If you do take with your two friends and you only take 120 mics my guess is that you will be able to take a walk, and that you will be able to even if you take 200 mics, because at least one of you will probably be functioning well enough to guide the walk. My experience is that you can forget how cold it really is when on LSD, so remember to wear warm clothes. There is also a possibility that you will decide to do something stupid and dangerous while on LSD. I wouldn&#039;t say the risk is high, but it definitely exists.<br /><br />At least tell someone sober that you will be taking LSD so that you can call this person in case of an emergency.

				Sadly I didnt listen to your suggestion with a higher dosage. We took around 200 mics each now and the trip wasn&#039;t what we expected. If you did let yourself go you had some small halus but not the ones we expected. When we ate shrooms the halus were at least equivalent if not more intense.<br />Anyways I&#039;m suffering under insomania at the moment, is it normal that you just can&#039;t sleep after that dose?

				Completely normal, it&#039;s hard to fall asleep after taking acid for most people, even on the comedown it can be.
