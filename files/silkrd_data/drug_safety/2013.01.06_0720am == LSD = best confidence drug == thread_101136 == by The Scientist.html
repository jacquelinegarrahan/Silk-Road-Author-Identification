				Anyone agree?<br />I never would have thought so, but yesterday I took enough LSD to experience ego death, and I never felt more socially confident in my entire life. I could do everything with a lightness that I never experienced before. And I&#039;ve done MDMA, cocaine, amphetamine, meth, and other confidence-boosting drugs. They were all far, far inferior to the confidence produced that LSD gave me.<br /><br />Will LSD always have this effect if I take enough of it?<br />Or will I have to rely on other drugs?

				Thats what good with LSD,<br /><br />Experience can be so different each time,<br /><br />when i used to do LSD regulary about 15-17 years ago it used to make me more &quot;close&quot; and less socially confident,<br />recently i have taken some acid again and had pretty similar effect to what you are describing here, and normally im far from being a social person.<br /><br />it depends alot of the setting, your mental state, maturity etc... i think its impossible to predict how your next experiences are going to be.

				Thats what im tellig you, its not a matter of amount (you can be sure i have taken way more that you are able to imagine :)<br /><br />But thats how&nbsp; LSD is,&nbsp; different people, setting, mental state, time, quality of LSD, giving different experience - as mentioned - its impossible to predict how your next experiences are going to be.<br /><br />the experience one is having is not the same as other will have and usually will not be same as following experiences of same person (assuming he has many experiences at different times, settings and mental states)<br /><br />i guess the best way to know is to try?

				I haven&#039;t felt particularly confident while on LSD, but I can say that one particular trip completely shattered my self hatred and made me a more confident person overall afterwards, right now we are on the 8th year and still going strong which is pretty fucking incredible.

				Maybe MDAI would be good for you to look into,<br />but Lyrica made me more confident and social..<br /><br />4-Methylaminorex has been used by government (prime ministers, presidents etc) to reduce stage fright.<br />Beta blockers apparantly help with this,<br /><br />Hydergine is another ergoloid said to be like LSD microdoses, It was discovered by Hoffmann and used daily by him, search for &quot;Hoffman Hydergine LSD microdose&quot; and check out about half the first page<br />It&#039;s a Nootropic that are just like stimulants in a way but -<br />in order to be classed as a Noot~ it must have no long term negative effects and must improve either Memory(long/short term Storage and/or Recall of memories), Cognition/Focus, and general mental processing and wellbeing.<br /><br />Of the ~racetams, Oxiracetam has been said by many to have a noticable cognitive enhancing ability and motivation boost.<br />

				Are you guys saying it helps confidence during the trip or also after the trip?&nbsp; If after for how long?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to experiment but I&#039;ve got to get off stupid antidepressants first because they disable the effects of psychedelics.
