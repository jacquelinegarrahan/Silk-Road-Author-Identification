				So I enjoy MDMA...I&#039;m glad that I&#039;m able to find pure, clean rolls here on SR because more often than not I get adulterated rolls or meth bombs outside...<br /><br />But I keep seeing listings for 4-MEC and from what I gather it&#039;s a RC cathinone that is supposed to be like MDMA lite...<br /><br />Anybody here try it before? How is it compared to MDMA? Would a capsule containing 100mg MDMA, 50mg methylone, and 50mg 4-MEC be a good idea? ???

				Never done 4-MEC but from what I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s way more stimmy than empathogenic. Methylone is really the only one I&#039;ve heard people say is genuinely like MDMA. I&#039;ve tried Mephedrone before too, but all that does is make me relaxed as fuck but somehow still energetic. It&#039;s really strange. It doesn&#039;t *feel* empathogenic to me at all, though.<br /><br />I&#039;d avoid most of the substituted cathinones, anyway. From what I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re addictive as shit and really hard on your heart, much moreso than amphetamines. The only one I&#039;ve done a whole bunch of is Methylone, though. And I didn&#039;t really feel like ( even after rolling for days on it ) it was really doing a lot of damage. Really clean, harmless feeling comedown. <br /><br />But I&#039;ve seen people binge on Mephedrone and get really fucked up from it so I would generally avoid it. Not that there&#039;s any problem with doing &#039;em. I just am personally against doing a lot of &#039;em.

But my chem knowledge is *very* limited so I am most definitely not the authority on this.

				Usually meth-compounds are much better, stronger, and of higher quality than eth-compounds. At least from my experiences. Throw a methyl on &#039;em and they get even better, at least in the case of mephedrone. I&#039;ve never done 4-MC but from what I&#039;ve heard mephedrone is pretty much the cream of the crop when it comes to stimmy euphoric cathinones.
