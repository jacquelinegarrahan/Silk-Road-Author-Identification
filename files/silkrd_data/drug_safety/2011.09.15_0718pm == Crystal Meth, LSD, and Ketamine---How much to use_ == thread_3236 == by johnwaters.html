				Lucy will keep you high for 6-10 hours, many suggest 100-200ug (1-2 blotters) which I consider quite low. If you really want to push the border, get at least 500ug. Be sure you are not afraid. Ketamine is a short lived thing and does not mix with lucy good. Also it can be dangerous to shoot it during the lucy trip as overdosing and needle injuries are likely to occure, so you may start with it or just leave it for another time. Meth is something I am unfamiliar with. Another nice long range substance is MDMA, which lasts for hours and makes a good mix with LSD. If you like introspective and dissociative, get some DMT. It drops you out of the world literally and lasts for about 10 - 20 minutes, though you can have it repeatedly as many times as you wish. Some say it is quite nice with LSD also. If you want to trip harder, get some DOB or DOI. They are twice as long and potent in compare to LSD. Also some 2c-b is good. Also you can use mescaline.<br /><br />Go lurk erowid.org . All required info about virtually any mind altering substance can be found there, including dosing and timing.<br /><br />Cheers

				Well, ketamine won&#039;t last that long no matter how much you will dose.<br /><br />Read this guide for dosage : http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_dose.shtml<br /><br />It will keep you around an hour. If you will try higher dose, you will just pass out and won&#039;t remember a thing, but it won&#039;t prolong the trip significantly. And in case of overdosing you will just sleep forever =]<br /><br />So if you really want to take a 36 hours marathon, you will have to redose several times, which can be unpredictable. Don&#039;t recomend it. What I can recomend is either take several short lived things (ket, dmt, sally) and explore them one by one or just abandon the idea of 36 hour lasting trip. Alternatively just have some psychedelic like lucy or shrooms. The 6 - 8 hours would be long enough to change your mind, and you can always redose with no real danger. <br /><br />If the 1.5 days from one dose is a real aim for you, then read about 2c-dragonfly and datura. These things are pure hardcore. Dragonfly can last about 30 hours, while datura can hold you up to 3 days depending of dosage. However they are really dangerous in their own ways, so don&#039;t give them a try if you are not experienced with mind altering substances and your reactions.

				I go thru 1.5 - 2grams of ketamine in a day and a half.<br />I would start with LSD then after peak move on to the Meth and finally some Ketamine, maybe&nbsp; some Ketamine sniffed during the LSD but don&#039;t get where you redose 3 times an hour.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath
