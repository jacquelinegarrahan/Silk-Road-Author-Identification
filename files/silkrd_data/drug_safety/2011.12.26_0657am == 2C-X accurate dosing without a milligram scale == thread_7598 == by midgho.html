				Title: <strong>2C-X accurate dosing without a milligram scale</strong><br />

				So, I recently purchased a bunch of premeasured capsules of 2c-X compounds. While each is measured out to a midrange dose, I want to (for example) bump from 10mg of 2C-P to 14mg. I don&#039;t have a milligram scale, but I do have exactly 5 mL vials, with measurement marks. I&#039;m thinking of dissolving 10mg to 5mL, then using the vials to do a liquid measurement.<br /><br />My scale, while it&#039;s rated for milligrams, I don&#039;t trust. If there&#039;s a better way of doing this, I&#039;d love to know, as I want to be as precise as possible.<br /><br />Also, in the dissolution process, would warm or hot deionized water be better for dissolution? As I don&#039;t think I can clean the 2C out of the gel caps, perhaps dissolving the caps with warm water would work so I don&#039;t lose a few milligrams.

				Warm distilled water or everclear are your best bets. Dissolve it anyway you want, 10 mg/5 ml should work. Take 7 mls for 14 mgs. Also, just dipping the open capsule, swirling it around and pouring out the water will be sufficient. No real need to dissolve the capsule.

				You definitely should have a reliable scale if your even getting into RC&#039;s not a good idea without one with some chemicals there is a thin line between death , or huge changes in experience and effects just from 1 milligram do research on what it is your taking and look at the dosages, be very accurate and be cautious

				You should find what is 2cx solubility in water weight/ml before you do it, syringe is maybe better alternative for meassure.

				Not trying to be a dick but miligram scales are not expensive on Amazon. You can get a gemini AWS for $25. Once you buy the scale you will have it forever. Don&#039;t fuck with 2c dosages...I literally thought I was going to die after taking too much 2c-d.
