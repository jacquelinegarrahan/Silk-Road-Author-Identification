				i just bought some pills from a kid in one of my classes, he told me they were adderall, the last ones i got from him were 60 mg vyvanse so i figured they&#039;d be vyvanse as well... they&#039;re blue and just say 60 on the bottom, but like with the pill standing up, any idea what it is? i dont really want to try a pill that just says 60 on it without knowing what it is, he told me it was time release adderall, i opened one up and it looked like powdered sugar...

				Doesn&#039;t sound like adderall as the inside of the extended release look like little balls and not like powdered sugar. A quick google search leads me to believe that it could be vyvanse. Does the other half of the pill say S489?

				thats what google made me think too but no, i do have some that say s489 but these ones are different, they are a bit darker blue and it only says 60 thats it not even 60 mgs, just 60, and its like if you rotated the words 90 degrees to the left if that makes sense, the words arent horizontal like the vyvanse

				they look old so anything else could be rubbed off or something, i asked him about it and he said they&#039;re just generic, but i mean even generic pills have something other than &quot;60&quot;
