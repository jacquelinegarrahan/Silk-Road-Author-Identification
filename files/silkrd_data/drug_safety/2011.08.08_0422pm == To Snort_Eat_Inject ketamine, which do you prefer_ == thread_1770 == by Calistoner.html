				ive been snorting a lot of k recently, feeling the mental addiction coming on, sucks.. <br /><br />its not like i fiend for it or anything, i just crave the awesomeness that occurs when you take it&nbsp; :P<br /><br />i havent tried eating it, but i hear its nice. <br /><br />i hear IM injection is the BEST route, but i will let other comment before i assume that. <br /><br /><br />only asking this because im tired of putting powder up my nose, makes me feel dirty and i know its tearing shit up.

				IM injection can be called both the BEST and the WORST route, depending on how you look at it... I&#039;d stick to snorting, just use moderation and maybe you wont get that dirty feeling?

				I like both.<br />I like to sniff in bumps because I like to walk on the edge of the K-hole like on the verge.<br />I also like to IM inject to head str8 into the K-hole.<br /><br />My only qualm with IM injection is as I start to leave the K-Hole or prolong the K-hole I can&#039;t function properly in a dissociative state to prepare or be as careful with a second dose of Ketamine.<br /><br />My solution to this this has been to prepare a IM injection dose of Ketamine and then cut out between 4-6 bumps/lines of Ketamine. I can&#039;t generally Injection in on the edge of leving a K-hole but I can still grab a straw and sniff a line or two of Ketmine to prolong the Khole as long as I have lines cut out or powder readily available to make a quick line.<br /><br />I would not attempt to stay in a K-hole for over 45 minutes. I have come back down though to functioning level and redosed.<br /><br />Also if you like Ketamine, you should give MXE a try..1 line and you are in Dissociation for 4-5 hours, It takes about 1:20 hours to kick in but once it does you&#039;re out there. You&#039;ll burn thru a bunch of Ketamine in 5 hours but not so much MXE.<br /><br />Like I can easily burn thru&nbsp; 500mg of Ketamine in a night if i want to really get on it, with MXE 100-120mg a night is plenty enough for me to be zonked.<br /><br />Over all I personally&nbsp; enjoy Ketamine a little better because it is the royal queen of dissociatives but MXE is a very good replacement and a bit cheaper than the queen. :D

				i snort it as i do with any drug i can really, strange, the thought of snorting anything used to repulse me, id only ever bomb the drugs i took in those days (mostly mdma and insane amounts of billy) i guess i was expecting it to be wholly unpleasant, then i tried coke for the first time and it wasnt half as bad as i thought (although i was totally underwhelmed by coke as has been the case since, no coke ive come across was worth what it cost for the buzz you get) now most everything goes up the snooter. ive never eaten it and i never have and never will inject anything i dont think but from reading reports on places like bluelight (FnB mainly) i hear injecting is bliss both with k and even more so with mxe.<br /><br />also i find it strange that people struggle to get K, out of anything it seems to be the one drug i can get hold of in insane purity almost anytime day or night 365 days of the year, i could only wish that weed or better still good hash was that abundant

				that explains a lot nomad, ive done it several times and always sniffing it, all it did was make me feel spacey and woozy, wasnt as great as every says it is. <br /><br />on of the vendors that was selling it said you can smoke it...<br /><br />im considering trying it out, but he says dose is 100mg-200mg thats a lot to smoke

				I tend to do about 150-250 a night when i use MXE but that&#039;s all sniffing and spread out in about 70mg increments. Sniff some every 3-4 hours or until I&#039;m where I want to be...just remember kids MXE takes about 1:20hours to kick in....she&#039;s sneaky.

The basics are, you dissolve ketamine in distilled or boiled water filtered through a coffee filter/cloth in a nasal spray bottle. I should mention that the easiness of dosing using a nasal spray can give you the tendency to blow through your ketamine stash ;) supposedly it also makes it easier to reach a k-hole compared to snorting.<br /><br />The main benefits for me are that it hurts less and the possibility that it might be absorbed better by the mucous membrane. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a page with detailed instructions: http://www.legalhighguides.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=5389
