				Most everything degrades over time.<br /><br />Heat, light and moisture are the enemies here, so yeah, the colder, darker &amp; drier you can keep the stuff, the better.<br /><br />For almost everybody, the only place fitting that description is a freezer.<br /><br />A sealed container in a deep freeze is ideal. If garden peas stay good for two years in there, everything else should be fine too.<br /><br />Just make sure things are properly wrapped and sealed as ice-crystals won&#039;t help the quality any.

				supposedly most pills lose alot of their potency after the expiration date (usually 1-5 years after being manufactured) but I&#039;ve taken benzo&#039;s that expired 20 years ago and I didn&#039;t notice any difference and in fact they seemed even stronger (maybe because in the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s the benzos were made stronger?)

				no worries. i never had any problem. but i always keep my drugs in a dry, dark place.

Most drugs will not degrade noticeably within a century, apart from a very few substances that are not that stable. <br /><br />Drug packaging requires that there is an expiry date on it, which cannot be longer than 5 years from the date of manufacture, regardless of how stable the product actually is. <br /><br />As mentioned a very old tablet of valium is as good as one produced yesterday. If it is more potent they only explanation would be that they put in a bit more than the advertised amount back in the day. <br /><br />Medications that suffer from reduced efficacy over time are really very rare. I doubt that 1% of all medicatoin prescribed today would be any less effective 50 from now, apart from things like antibiotics where the target organism is allowed a 50 year headstart to develop resistance ;)

				As Shulgin said, MDMA will probably outlive you if stored in a dry dark cool place and kept at room temp. Even went so far as to say that if you found MDMA that was stored in the Pharaohs tombs from ancient egypt and dropped it, it would still be magic. :)<br />This pretty much goes for all Phenethylamines.<br /><br />now if only I could find someone with some MDMA from the late 80&#039;s...

				As much as I read about it, synthetic drugs keep stable for very long durations - like many years - if they are in the salt (Hcl) form.<br /><br />Storage problems can develop with all hygroscopic stuff, i.e. substances like coke and GHB. Such drugs pull humidity from the air and in the extreme case all that will be left is a moist lump. <br />I think you can dry out coke, though, but that&#039;s not my pie.<br />

				Anyone know how stable the NBOMe like of chemicals are, particularly 25c-NBOMe? I&#039;ve had 20 tabs stored in a ziplock bag between the pages of a book kept lower than 15 degrees Celsius (60 Fahrenheit) for about 6 months, and I haven&#039;t tried them since I first put them in there. The tabs are HBPCD complexed, if that makes any difference. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a chemist so I have no idea whether 25c degrades in these conditions or not, and I know it&#039;s highly unlikely that they would decompose into something potentially harmful for one&#039;s health but I&#039;d rather be safe than sure. A quick google search told me that NBOMes are very stable at room temperature, but it would be great if someone on here could confirm this. <br />- JH

				It depends what happens to it really. THC as such is a very stable molecule, but with an organic product like weed you face other problems like mold. It&#039;s important to keep it as dry as you can (throw in a bag of silicagel desiccant if you want to) , and out of sunlight (brown glass jar would be fine). <br /><br />I suppose the cool, dry and dark mantra is actually true for most substances that are stable, though the cool part of it may actually not be required at all for many substances. <br /><br />Something like GBL is a different thing entirely, since its a pure liquid and quite a potent solvent too. Keeping it in glass bottles is best, as it is with most reagents really. There are very few compounds that will attack glass readily, and the ones that do are not things you should have lingering around the house or even a lab.

				Its probably a frost/condensation issue indeed.<br /><br />LSD as such is find to be kept in a freezer,&nbsp; but you must ensure it is sealed in waterproof bags if you do, and wait for them to come up to room temperature before opening them. A partcular risk of storing things in the freezer is opening their packaging before they fully reach room temperature. If you do so, moisture from the atmosphere is likely to condense on your sample, which can ruin it in some cases.

I picked up a 1/2 sheet of really, realllly good acid at a Grateful Dead show. And for some odd reason, I thought it was a good idea to wrap the sheet in tin foil and then place the tin foil in a big freezer bag and sore in the freezer.<br /><br />A few months later, I went to pull out my prized sheet of cid I bragged about for months...and it had all kinds of ice crystals formed on the outside of the bag, in addition to the tin foil inside. Also...we had a few power outages during that time frame which contributed to the condensation. When I pulled it out, immediately all the little crystals started to melt on the outside of the bag...so I pulled the tinfoil out as soon as I could...not a good idea either.<br /><br />So it was not the Freezer method per say that was not a good method...it was my method of storing in the freezer that was poorly thought out.

				Well I don&#039;t know about certain synthesized drugs but as already stated before it seems as almost all natural drugs degrade over time if not stored properly. I only say certain synthesized because I&#039;m not certain of every single last one of them, but even some of the synthesized ones will degrade over time if not stored properly. Since we&#039;re on the topic though it&#039;s got me wondering from more experienced users my only method for storing my LSD is keeping it in the dark in a tightly shut glass jar that should be good enough for long term storage right?

				Pharmaceutical drugs that are past their expiration date are sent to and used in third world countries.&nbsp; So that pill you have that &#039;expired&#039; a year ago is still absolutely fine to take.

				That is certainly true for the vast majority of medications. Taking a tablet of paracetamol, valium, omeprazol or such that is 10&nbsp; years beyond expiration date on the the label really poses no risk at all. Generally pharmaceuticals can only have an expiry date that is 5 years from the production date, no matter how stable they are. <br /><br />That said, it is always wise to investigate if you are taking something that expired. Things like tetracylcine and antimalarial drugs like malerone will degrade over time sometimes resulting in dangerous products and should never be taken beyond their expiry date. This issue affects a small minority of all medications available, but double checking is a wise precaution!
