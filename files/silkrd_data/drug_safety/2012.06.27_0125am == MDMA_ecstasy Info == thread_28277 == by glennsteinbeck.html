				Looking to buy some MDMA or some ecstasy variation for the first time. I&#039;ve heard good and bad things about pure MDMA and its effects on the brain, but I want the truth from seasoned ecstasy users. What is the difference between pure MDMA and other ingredients in terms of trip/safety/general feeling, especially when it comes to first-time users?

				Google this article - Canada wants to legalize MDMA.&nbsp; Top health officials from Canada are saying &quot;PURE&quot; MDMA when consumed responsibly by adults can be safe.&nbsp; Harvard experts have studied it also, saying if it is pure and not cut it can be safe.&nbsp;

				With pure MDMA your roll will not abruptly end (at least in my experience), and you will enjoy a nice long taper down to baseline, and you&#039;ll probably sleep really well while still being a little euphoric.&nbsp; <br />MDMA is the same, whether it&#039;s in pills or pure crystal.&nbsp; The stuff on Silk Road is generally fantastic quality.&nbsp; I have had very very dirty pills just full of md/speed combos and also just plain old meth, and there&#039;s a big difference.&nbsp; For one, with dirty pills I find I get a few hours in and the euphoria just STOPS, just like that.&nbsp; All of a sudden I think &quot;I am not having as much fun as I was 5 mins ago&quot;. As soon as that realisation hits, it&#039;s all over.&nbsp; Then you can&#039;t get to sleep no matter how hard you try!<br />Keep it pure, it&#039;s great!

				MDMA == MDMA == MDMA. The difference is that sometimes ecstasy contains other adulterants, but if you buy a good press from a good dealer, and test your pills, you can get pills that are MDMA only.<br /><br />Probably the two most common types of pills sold as &quot;ecstasy&quot; that aren&#039;t pure MDMA are:<br />- various piperazines, which often feel more trippy but not necessarily in a good way like your standard psychedelics, and also often come with heavy nausea and unpleasant feelings that can persist for a very long time. <br />- MDMA + Some stimulant, often Amphetamine or Caffeine, this is because while MDMA is a stimulant in itself, it doesn&#039;t have as much drive and push as most stimulants and so some people like a bit of a kick to give you energy for those all night raves etc.<br /><br />Pure MDMA is your classic loved up euphoria, while combining it with a stimulant turns it more into the dance drug it&#039;s touted as - it&#039;s often much nicer just on its own because the energy is still there, but not overpowering, and the love is unparalleled :)<br /><br />As for the safety of pure MDMA. Abusing it and similar drugs leads to some neurotoxicity and serotonin downregulation - what this means in simple terms is that overuse is quite damaging, and this is also the reason for people &quot;losing the magic&quot;, as when your serotonin axon count falls and your receptors downregulate there&#039;s a lot less serotonin flowing around in future rolls and you don&#039;t get the full effects of the love or empathy any more.<br /><br />Alexander Shulgin, who popularized MDMA found that 4 times a year was his maximum with MDMA before it started causing problems. This varies from person to person, with a minimum break of around a month between rolls being good for most people and with it going up to 3-4 months for some. Avoid repeated redoses too as these cumulative effects are more damaging (Stick to one redose a roll max imo), and of course make sure you test what&#039;s in your pills :) <br /><br /><br />
