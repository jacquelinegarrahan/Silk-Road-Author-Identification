				Hi a number of months ago I carried out some research on here with a number of buyers which proved to be very interesting.<br /><br />&nbsp;Quite a few people asked me to let them know when a journal paper was published <br /><br />This is the link to the first paper&nbsp; http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(13)00006-6/abstract<br /><br />The journal paper has received alot of great feedback. If anyone wants a full copy please email me&nbsp; hrireland@tormail.org ( this will be sent to you in a PDF format) - unfortunately&nbsp; there is nothing I can do about that <br /><br />I have another one under review which was the one I did with a number of buyers which I hope will be published in a few months time. <br /><br />All the best Tim<br /><br />

				This is highly annoying indeed. I used to be on a university ip address that granted me access to most elsevier and kluwer publications, among others, and that really was convenient to read any publication fulltext without limitation. <br /><br />What annoys me most is how expensive access is though, $35 or so for a single fulltext publication is ridiculous. I suppose its no miracle that university staff set up vpn software so they can see at home what they can see at work without those costs.
