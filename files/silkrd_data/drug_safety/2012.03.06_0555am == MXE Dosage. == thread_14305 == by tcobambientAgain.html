				Interesting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using MXE for about 3 months and never looked at the dosing amounts on Erowid.org.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always just snorted it but apparently if you take it by putting it under your tongue you use quite a bit less.&nbsp; I know that the last few times I&#039;ve been snorting over 100+ mg (probably around 120 - 150?&nbsp; Ordered a scale over the weekend and should have it this week) and the trips have been fucking awesome but I&#039;m gonna check into taking it orally and according to Erowid I could have the same trip for about 40 - 50mg.<br /><br />Anyone notice any differences when taking MXE orally?&nbsp; Are the trips the same as snorting?&nbsp; And can you really use so much less like the dosing chart says?&nbsp; <br /><br />Methoxetamine Dosages<br />Sublingual / Buccal<br />( very tentative )<br />Threshold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />3 - 10 mg<br />Light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />8 - 25 mg<br />Common&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />15 - 50 mg<br />Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />40+ mg<br /><br />Methoxetamine Dosages<br />Insufflated<br />( very tentative )<br />Threshold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 - 20 mg<br />Light&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />20 - 50 mg<br />Common&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />40 - 80 mg<br />Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />100+ mg

				Wow! 100mg seems like a lot at one go. I usually start with about 25mg oral. I&#039;m not big on snorting and I&#039;ve never plugged the stuff. And just the thought of letting it dissolve under my tongue sounds horrible and it&#039;s not even one of the worst tasting RCs.<br /><br />One of the things I like about MXE is that it stacks so well, meaning you can keep getting higher with repeated dosages, which is unlike most drugs from my experience.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty cautious about taking large doses of any compound at one time but I&#039;m risky with repeating doses. It&#039;s sort of my forte I guess. I&#039;ve&nbsp; done well over 200mg of substances like 2c-e and 4-aco-dmt in one night and full grams after the course of a few days, just to explore the effects of tolerances. I&#039;ve probably overdosed a dozen times over the last few decades but I&#039;m reluctant to do too much at one time. You can&#039;t turn back once you dose.

				I snorted MXE on my very first use.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe no more than 80mg, not sure.<br /><br />The effects were nice, lot&#039;s of fractals, but no M-hole.<br /><br />But today if I were to do 80mg sublingually (even after a few months of regular use), then I believe I would OD.<br /><br />20mg seems enough to take me near an M-hole.

				Umm I bought some really good MXE from a guy on SR (idk if its allowed to be said which account?) and i snorted 20 mg and I was knocked the fuck out. Keep in mind im a light weight skinny chicklet. This was after a stim binge thou.. I would say normal dose to fuck me up is 50 mg but i heard tolerance raises reallyyyy fast. Thats probably why yall have such a higher dose than me I started at like 20mg and dont do it that often... (snorted my next paragraph is a rant on how nasty it would be to eat/put under tounge.)<br /><br />ya im with Dr K or whoever last posted MXE is nasty. Most powders tastes like mofo SHIT. after i snort and do a little snort of water to get it down the taste is gross as fuck. Under the tounge? rather snort it bro and use&nbsp; more. Dont get me started on MDPV taste.. i just had to lick a bunch up while i was snorting in emergency people walking in situation. My tounge and lips are burning. Its been 30 minutes. LOL.
