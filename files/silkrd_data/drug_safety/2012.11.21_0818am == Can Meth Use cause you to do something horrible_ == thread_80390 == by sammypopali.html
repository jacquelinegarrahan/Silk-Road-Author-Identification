				So can someone binge so much that they laugh and talk to themselves? Is that psychosis? Smoke and shoot. Also shooting pills, but not as much as meth. What if they continue to binge? Can this much abuse cause you to do something very horrible?

				Doing too much of any drug can make you do something bad, especially something as hard as meth. Calm down a little bit on using so much if you are having bad thoughts creeping through your head, take care!

				yes that is psychosis which isnt actually caused by the meth but the sleep deprivation. Try staying awake for equal number of days not on anything and you will observe the same effects

				Yeah, I don&#039;t think meth alone will cause you to do something that&#039;s not natural behaviour for you. As ben said, sleep deprivation is the big concern. Meth makes me pretty mellow and friendly, never felt like hurting anyone....maybe doing something bad in order to buy meth, like stealing, but not directly caused by meth ingestion. <br />Anyone else?

I know im extremely cranky when tired. Not trying to suggest meth cant cause complete destruction to certain types of people, but i believe most of these effects can be attributed to either not sleeping or illegality of the drug itself. After all, dextroamphetamine is stronger on a mg for mg basis and its regulary prescribed to 5 year olds because ya&#039;know, theres something wrong with them running around, climbing trees and playing sport and stuff.<br /><br />BC

				I don&#039;t binge but I prefer to wake up have my breakfast and then start bowling. This way I dont stay up all night and don&#039;t seem to feel like shit nearly as much, mainly because I got enough sleep. Most I have ever done is over night and I started to think I was seeing shit (lack of sleep) but I was totally aware this was why. Problem with these drugs are they keep you going we would have the same affect and slightly have to a certain agree with drinking previously people would drink and pass out. Now they can go for longer because they drink redbull with their alcohol etc. I think drugs are for short duration use and not frequently either. Thats my opinion :)

				I know somebody that killed a grandmother and three children and then killed them self. They became really weird and scary for the last 6 months, constantly stealing everything, from family members and anyone.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think this would happen. Maybe it wasn&#039;t the drugs, and I am just looking for an excuse. It was a shock to all, and heartbreaking...

				After 3 to 5 days no sleep you will start to suffer from sleep deprivation psychosis aka stimulant or amphetamine psychosis... which will get progressively worse, your *clear* moments will get less and less frequent and last for less time.. with all the fun that goes with it. Delusions of grandeur, paranoid delusions etc... If in real life you would kill someone who you honestly believed was about to kill you then you have a good chance of trying to kill someone whilst you are on a psychotic break.. When you can&#039;t separate the imaginary from the real bad bad things can happen.. Sleep is important, a person suffering from sleep deprivation psychosis is dangerous...

How can you say meth doesn&#039;t cause psychosis? <br /><br />Anyways, when you combine stimulant psychosis and sleep deprivation psychosis it can cause you to do things that are odd. It can make some people violent. Anyone who disagrees with me hasn&#039;t went on a 16 day meth binge before. <br /><br />Now this doesn&#039;t mean that I&#039;m saying the drug causes this behavior. But, the drug helps create a situation where some individuals are more susceptible to making poor choices that can be bad. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also notice people to talk to themselves even while sober. (Thinking out loud?) I don&#039;t think this determines if someone is psychotic since most people have inner dialog with them self all the time. Some people call it their conscious.

				Well, not sleeping for a week can certainly make people do crazy things, regardless if that lack of sleep is drug induced or not.<br /><br />Skipping one night of sleep is something most people can cope with fairly well. But anything longer seriously impairs function and judgement for the vast majority of people. <br /><br />If you managed to stay awake for 72 hours using only legal drugs like coffee, you&#039;d probably be messed up to the point where you cannot drive a car without hitting some poles and parked vehicles, even if completely sober whereas alochol is concerned. <br />
