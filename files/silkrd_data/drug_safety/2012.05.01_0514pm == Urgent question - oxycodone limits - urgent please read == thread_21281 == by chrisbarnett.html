				Just to be clear, you are talking about percs with 10mg of Oxy in them, correct?<br /><br />Percs last about 4-6 hours and you will usually peak around the 30-60 minute mark.<br /><br />I would say if you are used to taking 2, then one more would be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think taking one more perc is going to hurt you if you can take 2 without any problem.<br /><br />My tolerance is fairly high, and right now I could probably take at least 10 without any problem.&nbsp; When my tolerance was low, I would take one or two and get a nice high.<br /><br />My best advice to you would be this.&nbsp; If taking two gives you a nice high, wait a couple hours before taking another 1 or 2, that will give you a slightly longer buzz.<br /><br />Also, I find Oxy&#039;s can make it hard to get a good nights sleep if you take them too close to bed time.&nbsp; You feel great, and you figure you can sleep no problem, only you end up lying there either not able to fall asleep, or you wake up in an hour.<br />

				30mg at 130lbs with no tolerance might make you sick, but I doubt it&#039;s enough to seriously OD. I gave this one kid a perc 30 to take for his 2nd time taking opiates, and he was also around 5&#039;10 but closer to 200lbs. He ended up getting very nauseous and almost puking, but enjoyed it in the end. It was making him very active instead of knocking him out. For some reason, oxycodone has that effect on some.

				Yes, everybody is a little different.&nbsp; Which is why I usually say start with half your normal dose, whatever that might be, and work your way up.&nbsp; Remembering that these things can take some time to work, so wait at least an hour or so with oxy&#039;s.<br /><br />The one to really watch out for is Methadone.&nbsp; It takes 3 hours to peak.&nbsp; So some kid takes 20-40mg and doesn&#039;t feel anything for 90 minutes, starts taking more, then passes out 3-4 hours later when it all starts to hit.

				I took 10mg oxycodone with a light opiate tolerance after my coworker had surgery and nearly hurled all over the place (I weigh 215lbs)<br />30mg would be really intense.. you&#039;d definitely get super high and you only might puke a little
