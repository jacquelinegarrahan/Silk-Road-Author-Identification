				Hey all, <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I recently received 8 pills of Phenobarbital (16.2mg) from a buddy of mine.&nbsp; I have had extensive experience with benzodiazepines and a myriad of other sedatives and hypnotics that I have heard are somewhat similar in their effects to barbituates.&nbsp; I have never had the privilege of trying pheno before and I figured I would ask those who have experience with it the best way to get the most out of what I have.&nbsp; Is it worth it to take them alone, or would they be better suited in aiding comedowns from stimulants and psychedelics?&nbsp; I&#039;m very interested in trying this pheno, but as always with any new drug, harm reduction and safety is my first priority.&nbsp; Does anyone have any particular DO&#039;s and DON&#039;Ts with phenobarbital? Any other drugs to be sure never to mix with pheno?&nbsp; I love psychedelics and am always needing something sedating to put me out after a long stimulating night.&nbsp; Can any of you vouch for pheno as a good way to come of psychedelics or ease comedowns?&nbsp; Any information you all have would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I&#039;m new here, but already I can see that this forum is populated by (mostly) intelligent people with a wealth of experience and respectable knowledge of the chemicals discussed here.&nbsp; Any advice?

				Do you feel the need to mix them with any other drug at all?<br /><br />If you do not, it&#039;s probably going to be fine. If you consider mixing them with alchol and/or benzo&#039;s, you need to be extremely careful.<br />

				Mixing phenobarbital with any other sort of depressant is incredibly dangerous. Benzos like a few Xanax and some alcohol in combination won&#039;t kill you more than likely, but phenobarbital and alcohol sure as fuck can.

				Not so much interested in mixing the phenobarbital with any depressants, but I am interested in any other interesting combinations that people have experienced.&nbsp; So I guess I can sum it up to these questions: <br /><br />1. Is Phenobarbital recreational enough as a stand-alone (no mixing)?<br />2. What other combinations do those of you with experience with phenobarbital have a particular affinity for?<br />3. I&#039;d like to hear some subjective accounts of barbs vs. Benzos from those familiar with both, please.<br />4. I love psychedelics and am curious if phenobarbital is an effective sedative to sleep/alleviate anxiety at the end of a trip.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -ALSO, please discuss YOUR favorite sedative/benzo/downer to wind down a good trip or roll.<br />5.&nbsp; Silk Road Rules!&nbsp; Happy to be here.&nbsp; Loving the forums.&nbsp; Than you all!<br /><br />I hope I get some responses from people who have a minute to help me out.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!&nbsp;

				That&#039;s the thing. Phenobarbital is the least recreational of all barbituates, and there&#039;s not very many people who have tried any other barb.<br /><br />It&#039;s recreational, but as for &quot;mixing&quot; stuff with it... beyond weed.. no. <br /><br />And I believe it takes awhile to kick in, so it would not be effective for your purposes. <br /><br />I recommend lorazepam or alprazolam for comedowns.

				Awesome, thanks for the info BruceCampbell&nbsp; :).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking at Etizolam on SR now for the past few days, have you had any experience with it?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been reading a couple posts around the forum that suggest it may be very useful post-trip.

				Do all drugs need to be recreational?<br /><br />Something like phenbarb may not have any recreational value, but it is a good hypnotic on its own. Perhaps its not a compund for those that want to party, but it can be valuable to those that simply require sleep.
