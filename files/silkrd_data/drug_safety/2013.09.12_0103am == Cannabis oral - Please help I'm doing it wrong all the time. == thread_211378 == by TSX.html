				I have tried it 3-4 times now and never had any effect from it, just wasting a lot of material.<br />Does cannabis need fat&#039;s to be active orally? I made cannabutter from buds with lots of patience in the 3 hours that I let it bind onto the fat. Unfortunately I took way to much fat, resulting in low amounts of cannabinoids per gram. I made an apple pie out of it, have eaten the amount that should be 2g, no effect at all.<br /><br />I also tried to make cacao a few years ago by just putting butter on top, letting it melt and then putting grinded buds into the fat. But I guess the amount was to low anyway.<br /><br />Is it possible to just eat plant material? I saw someone selling THC capsules, containing THC oil, if that works than just eating a bud should also work right? <br />Does it work much better when combined with fat?<br /><br />Also a side question, can anyone describe the difference in effect when consumed orally vs. smoked? I heard there is a massive difference.

				Cannabis must be properly binded with fat and decarboxylated for it to be properly absorbed in the digestive system. You can research various methods for this.<br /><br />Also it is common that some people cannot absorb THC at all via eating it. It varies from person to person but I&#039;ve met many people who&#039;ll eat potent brownies and not feel an effect while I&#039;m blazed off the same one.

				I would suggest purchasing an edible and trying it out --&gt; this will reveal if there is a problem with your cooking/extraction process.<br /><br />If you want to eat the raw plant material you should water cure it and then de-carboxylize it. The water curing helps remove any impurities while the de-carboxylizing ensures the THC is active and thus in its psychoactive form. <br /><br />Feel free to message with any other questions.

				I don&#039;t have a ton of experience here, but yeah everything I&#039;ve read indicates that you need to have a fairly high fat content to absorm the THC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve basically gotten some pop and fresh chocolate chip cookie dough, and put in about a 1/8 teaspoon of ground weed and kneaded it in, then cooked &#039;em.&nbsp; Worked pretty well (not too high, but OK for me...a pretty potent cookie would be about 1/2 a teaspoon per cookie I&#039;d figure). <br /><br />However, the raw cannabis seemed to upset my stomach a little.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve been thinking about doing some cannabutter (have some ABV weed and some other weed I just don&#039;t like too much).&nbsp; There&#039;s a few recipies I&#039;d found on the interwebs that I was going to try.<br /><br />So what happened to your cannabutter?&nbsp; How&#039;d you loose the fat?&nbsp; <br /><br />R.

				That is a really good idea. Just buying edibles to see if I&#039;m failing or if my body just doesn&#039;t want it.<br /><br />What happened to the cannabutter? Well I made an apple pie with all of the 150g (it is pure milk fat 99.8% I don&#039;t know the English word for it, it&#039;s basically butter without water, just the milk fat) that&#039;s what happened to it. :)<br />As I said in the OP eating lots of it, not yielding any noticeable effect.<br />

				This is the recipe I use and it works every time:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144692.msg1496365#msg1496365">Quote from: Ballzinator on August 27, 2013, 07:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think this is a good place to share my canna-coco recipe :D<br /><br />-1 stick of butter<br />-3 grams of good hash (5 if it&#039;s not that good)<br />-milk<br />-cocoa powder<br />-some water<br />-pot<br />-stove<br /><br />Heat some water (just enough to protect the butter from going over 100Â°C) in the pot and add the butter. While the butter is dissolving, chop the hash into powder. Once the water starts boiling, turn down the heat to just enough to keep it simmering and add the hash. Wait 20-30 minutes while giving the mixture a little stir every five minutes.<br />Pour it into a container (preferably metal as it allows the mixture to cool quicker) and let it cool to room temperature or put it in a fridge. It is important to not move the container once the butter starts solidifying so it can form a solid sheet at the surface. Once the butter is completely solidified (the container must not feel warm at this point), simply take it out of the container and dispose of the water. There might be a thin layer of brown/gray hash goo left on the underside of the butter sheet. Just scrape that off.<br />Make a cup of hot chocolate and dissolve a tablespoon of cannabutter in it. The taste is fucking amazing and so is the high. Takes a long time to kick in though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Ooh, lemme chime in. I have actually had so many bad experiences with this and know how it feels to lose bud. I did some research and found a method that works. If you want sources, I&#039;ll add them in.<br /><br />Let&#039;s go through this step by step:<br /><br />Problems people have:<br />1) Weed exists as THC-A. In order to fully decarb it, you need a temp of around 250F for about 30 minutes, upon which 98% of it will be decarbed. Most people skip this step, leading to a greatly diminished product.<br /><br />2) You need high fat content, but you also need the fat that you are using to reach temperatures. I am not a fan of the water-boiler method because it does not reach the temperature needed.&nbsp; They often compensate for this by cooking it for excessively long periods of time--I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard of &quot;success&quot; from a crock pot used for 24 hours. The reason it&#039;s probably taking so long is because of decarbing. <br /><br /><br />Quick way (try this with about 1 gram so you can test it out):<br />--Get 1 gram bud<br />--Get candy thermometer (sold in Walmart for like $1) because you need the core temperature to break 250. <br />--Put oil/butter in with the weed.<br />--IMPORTANT: Cook on 320 (just enough to not burn off the goodies) for 45 minutes. The 45 minutes starts ONCE THE CORE TEMPERATURE (OIL) REACHES 320!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why people make the shit overly complicated. It&#039;s a temperature game, and the oven is much quicker and efficient. Water reaches a temp max of 212F, unless you are like near the core of the Earth. At that temp, you are hoping that you leave it in long enough to make up for being in the sub-optimal decarb/cook range of 250-340F. It takes forever.<br /><br />Addendum: on dosages.<br />For a pothead, a dose of about 80mg is needed. So, whatever amount you use, just&nbsp; take: (the average THC content of weed you&#039;re using/100)*(amount of weed)*0.9.&nbsp; I have found the 0.9 to be a good coefficient because about 10% is lost in the process. <br />

				&nbsp; In another life, I had access to almost unlimited quantities of cannabis, and being a decent cook, my expertise was making brownies and other edibles.&nbsp; &nbsp;We happened across a load of herb that had been forgotten, and had started to degrade, so we bought it at a considerable discount.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The general recipe we would use, would be to grind the weed as finely as possible, then we would put 30g of it in a pyrex dish with 3 sticks of butter, and place it inside a temperature controlled hot-plate or electric fry pan, at about 220-280F(just shy of making the butter simmer) and kept hot for 45 minutes, after which the butter would turn a greenish color.&nbsp; One time, I left it for 2 hours, and the butter turned red, this is probably too much, yet there was no noticeable decrease in potency. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the things which makes butter such a good delivery system is that the triglycerides are heavy in nature, and highly bioavailable in the body, this is partially due to naturally occurring lecithin(phosphodiatyl choline), an emulsifier.&nbsp; We would mix the butter with commercially available brownie mix, and substitute for oil.&nbsp; Since then, I have experimented with various ways of consuming THC, marinol, firecrackers, and low-temp butter, which is probably superior to the high-heat butter that I used to make. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Lecithin is very important, almost all commercial mixes and chocolate have lecithin in them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lecithin can be purchased as a powder, in granules for baking, and in liquid capsules.&nbsp; If you take a gram of liquid lecithin, and add it to a small jar of water with a few ml. of oil, and shake it, you will notice that it encapsulates the oil, and breaks up the droplets in to fine little globs, which eventually almost completely fill the area, this is what happens in your stomach, the surface area of a thousand small spheres is far greater than one large sphere.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I&#039;ve taken Marinol(sesame oil with synthetic THC), I would usually take 50mg of THC with a 1200mg Lecithin cap, and a chocolate truffle.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Marinol, even the generic, is expensive as hell, although I have to say that I prefer it to natural herb, and it elicits a strong response from non-habitual THC users.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The tactile sensation from oral THC is the best part after the meditative aspect and euphoria, all of which DO vary from person to person. I can usually tell the THC is working by rubbing my hands together, if they feel wet or clammy, its working! Textures seem to appear more detailed on oral THC, as well.&nbsp; An acidic stomach is also somewhat prohibitive to the process, so keep that in mind, and if you smoke/vape more than 1/2oz of highgrade a week, understand that you may not be able to get very high off of anything but the strongest edibles.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have done experiments on extremely heavy herb smokers, and most of them do not report feeling very high.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hear Palm Oil is the thing to use these days, because you can cap it easily, and it is vegan.

				TSX- I love your threads and questions. What&#039;s funny to me is that they are all issues/question I have myself; so much similarity that it is uncanny sometimes. I hear that brownies are the way to go, tried and true classic method. Just leave them in the oven above 250 for a while (most quick mixes require at least 250-300 anyway). Let us know how it goes, looking foward to hearing results!

				The only thing you need is time and heat, really. Anything in the 250-330 range for 45 minutes in a fatty solution will do it.
