				I just made a post here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0 regarding using MDMA together with GHB, and decided to give it its own thread so more people can have access to this information - which I notice that not that many people are aware of. So here it is:<br /><br />MDMA and GHB: Designed to work together!<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Everyone who knows and loves MDMA for the blessed sacrament that it is, knows that there is also a shadow, a sting in the tail.<br /><br />For me personally, the hardest thing is being &quot;cast out of heaven&quot; as the MDMA space starts to fragment and I remember again my un-blissful self. This is of course when we might consider re-dosing - which you can get away with once, but generally not twice (without somewhat gnarly consequences).<br /><br />Then there is the cold hard reality of non-ecstasy (and potentially post-MDMA tension and edginess) followed by being totally washed out the next day - and then the proverbial &quot;Suicide Tuesday&quot; where the effects of serotonin depletion are felt good and proper.<br /><br />Using GHB after MDMA is a way to totally change this experience :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As follows:<br /><br />Whether one is doing single dose MDMA or with a kicker at the 1-2 hour point, there will come a time when the MDMA experience first starts to fragment and you start to drop out.<br /><br />This is the time to start taking GHB, normally as a first single dose of 1.5g - 2.5g, and this should be taken the moment the first drop is noted in the MDMA. (And ideally one would have experimented with GHB on its own before hand in order to be familiar with its dosing dynamics.)<br /><br />What will happen is that the GHB will come on in 15-25 minutes (and while there is still some MDMA activity), and essentially re-energize the MDMA space completely - while also adding its own character.<br /><br />There will be a deep and relaxing rush, often an even fuller euphoric empathy than felt originally and, most delightfully, the adding of the strong erotic and humorous nature of GHB :)<br /><br />MDMA is generally very sensual, but not directly sexual. GHB will add a deeply erotic, disinhibited and sexual dimension to the space. If you are with your lover at this point there will definitely be movement into deep and released sexual play.<br /><br />Most importantly, the usual sensation of coming off MDMA will be totally not noticed in the rushy pleasure as the two drugs gracefully blend and the GHB starts to take over from the MDMA. The GHB will certainly extend the MDMA roll for a couple of hours, and as you can re-dose GHB repeatedly without ill-effects (within reason) you can extend the zone for a long time.<br /><br />In time the GHB will put you down into a deep and restful sleep, from which you will awaken some hours later feeling refreshed and way more energized than you would have been without it. There will still be some residual tiredness in the system from the MDMA, but much less, and generally the following day will be much smoother and easier - and even totally benign.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has used GHB in this way, flat refuses to take MDMA without it now, and it&#039;s the same for me. It&#039;s frankly not worth it. And the pleasurable elaboration of the potential of MDMA by the GHB makes for a much richer experience altogether.<br /><br />So there it is! It is my hope that this information will give more people the opportunity to profoundly enrich their MDMA use and also mitigate most of the unpleasant after-effects.<br /><br />Any questions, just ask...<br /><br />BG

				Interesting idea, but I prefer benzodiazepines to GHB. I have no room to talk though considering I currently have a MDMA/MDA/Meth.cocaine pill.&nbsp; :o

				I never would have thought to use GHB this way, but this is really interesting stuff. Thanks for the post! <br /><br />Another thing that I&#039;ve found helpful is to take 5-htp and a protein supplement at the end of your roll. Also, using piracetam or aniracetam a week before dosing your roll can make the roll feel like it was your very first one. (From personal experience).

				@BruceCampbell<br /><br />Sounds delightful :)&nbsp; &nbsp;Enjoy!!<br /><br />Benzos are OK, but they don&#039;t enhance the sexual intimacy like GHB does. Will chill things down very well for sure but I consider GHB far more pleasurable and playful...<br /><br />BG

				Might have to give this one a whirl!&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been interested in trying GHB, and this gives me the perfect excuse.<br />I&#039;ve also found that taking 5-HTP, Magnesium, and a multivitamin post comedown does wonders for the day after.

				Yes, agree totally on the 5-HTP! Obligatory IMHO...<br /><br />I would normally take this after the GHB, either before or after sleeping a bit.<br /><br />Have not done Piracetam with MDMA (thanks for the suggestion!) but have used it with acid to very good effect :)<br /><br />If you&#039;re new to GHB I definitely suggest doing some experiments with it first using different dosing protocols to see what works for you.<br /><br />Then once you are familiar with it, bring it into the MDMA space...<br /><br />BG

				<br />I HATE GHB.&nbsp; On that note. I loooove gbl ( can get from jennifers) and ghb powder (which you can get from TommyG). Both on SR, I hate ghb liquid due to the reason of it being so dose sensitive and not knowing the strength it was mixed. I have taken it once and never again. I have take ghb powder and gbl fairly regulary. LOVE IT. Doses gor powder is 1.5 grams, dose for gbl is 1.5 ml. I have been rolling with G for about 15 years now. Has been only with gbl for about 14 of those years, till recently found ghb powder on SR. Still I prefer the gbl. Everything the OP said is correct!!!!! The best. Careful though with trying to dose measuring in a syringe or something while rolling, have some other eyes to help with judgment. The lines will be moving LOL. SO if in doubt, don&#039;t. I have dosed myself too high one night while rolling and was lost for a while. People said I looked like I was feeling good, but I don&#039;t remember!&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT yes, I don&#039;t roll w/o my g.

GHB will increase the sexual dimension again - so more wood, more juice, more desire and more eroticism altogether.<br /><br />Personally I find it good to bring the GHB in later - so enjoy the more sensual and empathic depths with my partner first and then get down and dirty with the GHB after that once the MDMA is dropping off...

I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; Maybe do an Erowid Vault search, that will answer your questions. There are also two different qualities of gbl. Chinese gbl is poop. German BASF gbl is tits. <br /><br />It has been sold on the market as &quot;industrial solvent&quot; since I have been buying it (15 years). Whether it is sold JUST for that at some places is a mystery to me. When I bought it back in the day it came in an aluminum wheel polish container (which those companies still sell-just not to my country). Some places it was labeled as paint remover. All were sold knowing that it was to be used for human consumption, simply a way to disguise I guess. That is why they will describe as Chinese or German BASF, so no one will bitch about the quality-they will know what type they are consuming. <br /><br />All my opinions though. If you put a drop of gbl on a compact disc, that drop will melt the plastic lol. I have ruined many favorite cd&#039;s at parties while dosing around them. Our stomach acid&#039;s pH can kick gbl&#039;s pH no doubt though. <br /><br />I prefer gbl over all other g&#039;s.

I still have plenty doses left b/t gbl and ghb powder so it wouldn&#039;t be anytime soon. <br /><br />Hey guys. If you don&#039;t have any ghb powder in your stock, you&#039;re doing yourselves a dis-service. Get some, try some. Then try some with your fave chemicals (especially mdma, mda, speed, meth) adds a whole nutha dimension to it. Well worth the cost. <br /><br />*****BlueGiraffe&#039;s goods look top notch !!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have never tried, at least get the 25 g so you and your friends can taste it. You will then be glad and add it to your collection. Really, this stuff should not be a secret. I&#039;ve had some wild nights on G alone !!!&nbsp; Very very fun!&nbsp; *****<br /><br /><br /><br />

Appreciate your support of my POV regarding this - it makes such a difference! <br /><br />If I may also mention though: I would not take GBL if it was 99.999% pure, free and available from my local grocery store. It is a strong solvent, and it will stress your liver big time - not good at all for long term health and vitality. Reacted properly to GHB though it is benign.<br /><br />TommyG appears not to have any active listings currently, so you may acquire GHB powder from us (see link in my signature). Great to meet a fellow appreciator! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Correct, no likey the pre-made liquid ghb.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not know that about the liver thing, I will look into that for sure. I rotate between the two substances. Yes Tommy G has been out for a little while. I loved him because his prices were awesome and he was a couple states over from me in the U.S. <br /><br />I moved on over to your page, love it. Lots of good information too. I did not know of the different forms of ghb powder. Very interesting. Prices are kind of higher than I&#039;m used to per gram, gets closer to my usual prices at 100 grams or more. Which is what I usually buy.&nbsp; However it sounds like your product is top notch stuff !!! I have only had TommyG ghb powder. I may get a dab of yours to compare sometime. I still have plenty doses left b/t gbl and ghb powder so it wouldn&#039;t be anytime soon. <br /><br />Hey guys. If you don&#039;t have any ghb powder in your stock, you&#039;re doing yourselves a dis-service. Get some, try some. Then try some with your fave chemicals (especially mdma, mda, speed, meth) adds a whole nutha dimension to it. Well worth the cost. <br /><br />*****BlueGiraffe&#039;s goods look top notch !!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have never tried, at least get the 25 g so you and your friends can taste it. You will then be glad and add it to your collection. Really, this stuff should not be a secret. I&#039;ve had some wild nights on G alone !!!&nbsp; Very very fun!&nbsp; *****<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the vote of confidence! We normally sell in the 100g - 200g range, and so prices are pegged there - the smaller amounts are really for people to try out our gear before making a larger purchase...

				GHB mixed with other depressants in large doses of either is dangerous. Totally correct. Those combos should ALWAYS be avoided.<br /><br />GHB post MDMA is safe, delightful and therapeutic. It combines well with all other stimulants, psychedelics and empathogens / entactogens.<br /><br />Dosing dynamics require a little bit of consciousness and experimentation to get the full benefits of GHB. If used wisely it is totally safe and benign.<br /><br />Full information here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.0<br /><br />BG

				If your going to drop mdma twice in session when is the best time to get on the GHB on the comedown from the second?

				Nice post Blue !<br />I&#039;ve ordered 10g of your GHB after reading it! But just a little question, I&#039;ll take approx 0.3 g of MD + Speed + Coke ( no alcohol ) on the 31st, with a friend &amp; 2 girls. Is it dangerous to take 1-1.5g of your prod after that for beginners ( we don&#039;t want to rape the girls Haha ) ? Or we should start lower ? Do we still need Cialis with GHB :P ?

Easy on your heart though - that could be a stressful combo, depending on how much speed and coke you&#039;re planning to do. Personally I would be cautious - but you know what you&#039;re doing I am sure...<br /><br />GHB after the MDMA will be fine and, frankly you might need it, given what you&#039;re planning on taking! Start with 1.5g and then bump it up slowly in 0.5g - 1g increments every half an hour until you&#039;re in the zone. Remember the ladies are more sensitive to GHB even apart from accounting for body weight. And yes, I agree, consent much more pleasant!<br /><br />Fuck Cialis! Tumescent cock that won&#039;t quit is the result of emotionally felt DESIRE. GHB relaxes emotional and body armoring and allows deep eroticism to flower in it&#039;s fullness. Cialis / Viagra et al are crude mechanical tools that close valves and mess with the natural way the cock works. If you love her then she is beautiful and if you are relaxed enough then there is wood ;)&nbsp; Easy on the stimulants though - you know how it goes...<br /><br />Have a delightful evening ;)<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

Totally apart from the fact they are easier to make by amateurs (and thus not always of decent quality), the main issue is no-one knows the dilution ratio - and it is very easy to take too much by mistake. This is why I always advocate powder. Cleaner, and you&#039;re doing the measuring personally so you always know how much you&#039;re taking.<br /><br />And as you state that is often the largest problem: The person is actually just deeply asleep, but to someone who does not know why, it looks serious. This is why I generally do my partying on GHB in an intimate circumstance where I am free to go down if I choose. That being said I do also occasionally use it out - and I just make sure that I dose slowly and progressively, and then it is fine.&nbsp; There is a GHB: Art of Dosing Tutorial here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90582.50<br /><br />BG<br />

				I was actually wanting to see how well the GHB tapers the MDMA comedown in comparison to 2C-B first. :) Altough LSD + MDMA + 2C-B is my absolute favorite combination, I want to further test GHB before I add it to my coveted experience!<br /><br />My timeline right now is as follows:<br /><br />T+0:00: ~400ug LSD<br />T+2:00: 140mg MDMA<br />T+6:00: 1g GHB<br /><br />Who knows though, I may just go ahead and add 2C-B to the combination as well.

				What about Enriching the MDA experience and mitigating its after-effects with GHB.<br /><br />MDA vs MDMA.<br /><br />Any thoughts? I guess I am still confused about the relation, if any, to these two substances with one another. Aside from a missing vowel. :)<br /><br />-onion-

				I&#039;m sure the effects would be very similar with such a combination. MDA and it&#039;s methylated cousin MDMA are very, very closely related and have an affinity for the same receptors. One of the primary differences, however, is that MDA has a higher efficacy in stimulating the 5-HT2A receptor than MDMA which pronounces for a more psychedelic roll. MDA is also said to be much more neurotoxic so the same caution you would follow for MDMA should also be taken when ingesting MDA, and probably even more-so.

				I used to use it after a mephedrone binge. Makes the comedown a million times better. It&#039;s a pretty nice drug if used sparingly.<br />I was briefly addicted to gbl though so if I ever use it with MDMA I would need to order less than 50 grams of ghb.<br /><br />GHB addiction is not pretty!

				Tried this once in a house party gotta be honest didnt really think it was that good id rather have quite a few drinks before the rave then get on the mdma and not have to worry about falling asleep or issues with how much alcohol ive drunk, and also getting 5 grams of powder into a rave round here is a little on the awkward side and then youve gotta top up your water etc. bit of a hassle for me.

				Interesting thread - shame that activity kinda went down.<br /><br />Hope that BG or some other connoisseurs here can help me to understand as to how GHB produces this anti-downer effect.<br /><br />If MDMA depletes ones serotonin reserves and it takes a couple of days to replenish them, then how does GHB affect this?<br /><br />My personal only experience with MDMA was pleasant, but next couple of days were such that I have never gone back ... If this is truly somehow affecting this I would be keen to try that fabled LSD + MDMA (+2CB) + GHB combo.

Deep conversation, electric music (Move D, Soundcloud/Panoramabar) and the best was still to come ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Apologies only responding now - been off the forums for a while...<br /><br />Your dosage protocol and experience altogether sounds most excellent!! :)<br /><br />Love your poetic descriptions, especially the White Lightening comment ;)<br /><br />You may also consider taking the Moxy 3mg at a time and alternating with the GHB and slowly building them both up - also distinctly pleasurable...<br /><br />BG

				I second that..Thanks BG!<br /><br />The best setting for the MDMA GHB combo is on a big bed with somebody that you are comfortable with :) <br /><br />It&#039;s more of an intimate roll, taking the GHB after peaking can lead to some fun times!<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to try the mescalin when it&#039;s ready for market!

They are both phenethylamines which contributes to this. Mescaline on its own already has mild MDMA-like empathogenic qualities and when taken with MDMA it allows for both a lowering of the MDMA dose as well as bringing a deeper psychedelic richness into play.<br /><br />As MDMA is certainly neurotoxic to a degree, whereas Mescaline is not, the ability to lower the MDMA dose in the presence of Mescaline and still achieve the same empathic effect is clearly positive for one&#039;s neurological health. <br /><br />Mescaline will also tend to extend the duration of the MDMA experience, and allow better psychological integration.<br /><br />Mescaline also combines well with GHB, which is often used (as discussed in the beginning of this thread) to extend the MDMA experience and create a much smoother transition from the MDMA state back to baseline.<br /><br />When using only Mescaline and GHB together, it can become quite MDMA-like, though with more psychic richness, humour, and in-your-face sexuality.<br /><br />Certainly a profound combination is to use Mescaline first, then take MDMA on the peak, and then start taking GHB about 2-3 hours after dropping the MDMA - very special and I highly recommend ;)<br /><br />Blue(Shimmering)Giraffe
