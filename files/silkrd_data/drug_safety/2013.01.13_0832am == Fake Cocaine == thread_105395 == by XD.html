			<dd class="postbody">
				Whatsup people,<br />Recently I&#039;ve been using a bit too much coke, and I want to cut back on it but I&#039;m addicted to the snorting and numbness of the substance. Few friends suggested to mix pure caffeine powder, or crush few 200mg caffeine pills and mix it with benzocaine or lidocaine powder, apparently gives you the same buzz as coke does without the euphoric high. Most websites that offer benzocaine or lidocaine powders are rip-offs, or just plain scams. I found that the best best bet is to buy the powders from China, but they sell them in kilo&#039;s and customs are extremely strict about importing stuff like benzocaine or lidocaine or any type of powder substance from China for personal use. Anybody know any other good substitutes to coke? I heard mixing caffeine with teething powder is also a good alternative. Also, what is the better solution? Mixing pure caffeine powder with benzocaine or lidocaine? Which gives that better coke type numbness? <br /><br />Stay safe, <br />thanks for the answers.

Has anyone tried this? Is it any good at all? I just read up on it, and so far from what I read, apparently it has the same effect as the lowest grade cut-coke you could get.
