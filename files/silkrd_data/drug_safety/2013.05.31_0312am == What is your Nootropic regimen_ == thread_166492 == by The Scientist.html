				when i wake up every morning, i take the following:<br /><br />gengseng<br />00mg Lion&#039;s Mane <br />400mg Pyritinol<br />0.3 g psilcoybin mushrooms<br />800mg CDPcholine <br />5g fish oil <br />150mg picamilon <br />1g sulbutiamine <br />1g bacopa<br />4g piracetam in the morning<br />a multivitamin<br />protein powder <br />grape seed extract<br />cannibidiol<br /><br />Most of this is mixed into a blender with fruit and vegetables.<br /><br />The goal of this regimen is to overall increase my cognitive abilities, increase attentiveness, improve my memory, reduce depression, and ease social anxiety. I have been taking this regimen for the last 2 weeks with good results. As a college student, I need to be able to maintain focus recall lectures and notes, and be able to remain socially active in my professional and personal life.<br /><br />i include a small dosage of psilocybin because i find it is a powerful nootropic in small quantities, plus it increases my visual acuity, and my interest in study material.

				Do you actually take this every day? I guess most are dietary supplements so I suppose they can&#039;t do much harm. But psilocybin every day. I know it is a tiny dose but I&#039;ve only heard anecdotal reports of that working as a nootropic. I also don&#039;t understand the cannabidiol.<br /><br />0mg of Lions Main. I take that every day too!<br /><br />Anyway if you&#039;re getting good results then fair enough but I&#039;m sure if you got into college you are smart enough to do this without nootropics. So you shouldn&#039;t get reliant on them. The shrooms and the cannabidiol anyway. <br /><br />Why not just stick to good old caffeine?!

				Scientist - did you experiment with nootropics before the past 2 weeks, or is this your first go? <br /><br />I currently use:<br /><br />800mg Nootropil (piracetam)<br />50-100mg Modiodal/Modafinil (provigil)<br />green tea<br /><br />All other vitamins in the evening<br /><br />I take the 800mg Nootropil and break a 100mg Modafinil in half, take those upon waking with a huge glass of water. Normally vitamins/pills make me sick on an empty stomach but I find I don&#039;t even notice these even if I don&#039;t get to eat right away. I will occasionally drink green or oolong tea, but not too much as caffeine makes me anxious. If I have a high-concentration work day, I will take the other 50mg by 2 or 3pm. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing this for about 2 months with minor adjustments here and there. The first couple of weeks I noticed a peculiar smell to water, which has dissipated over time. I tend to take a break on non-work days but the effect seems to still be there - for example, I forgot to take it this morning but I am keeping pace with my regular work load/mood. This might be a learning effect? It seems to be new, maybe the last few weeks, as when I first started I could definitely tell the difference between non-consumption. <br /><br />I sure as shit wish I had known about this in college, and would have definitely added the psilocybin too

				1 gram of sulbutiamine is an extreme amount; 1/10 of that is more than enough, if you&#039;re using it as a source of thiamin. Beyond that it apparently beings to act like a drug.<br />I wouldn&#039;t take pyritinol; stick to P5P, the bioidentical form. Again, 400mg is an extreme dose, 1/10 of that is plenty given a proper diet. <br />800mg CDPcholine is also a lot. People on nootropics/longevity/bodybuilding forums like to write about how they feel fine after taking their megadoses, but I don&#039;t think such doses are justified based on animal studies and cognitive tests of alzheimer&#039;s patients. Such a substantial intervention into one&#039;s neurochemistry will produce innumerable compensatory reactions which no one has, or will ever, study in rats or the demented.<br />Picamilon is good. GABA helps antagonize excessive excitatory factors (internal and external), and niacin increases redox capacity and lowers levels of free fatty acids.<br />Most multivitamins use inferior ingredients in often toxic amounts. Most important is to avoid supplements that contain iron; excess free iron causes or exacerbates most degenerative diseases by its continuous generation of ROS.<br />Lion&#039;s mane&#039;s good. <br /><br />DON&#039;T take fish oil. It&#039;s a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, both directly and by suppressing the production and release of thyroid hormone. It creates a huge burden of oxidative stress, since it&#039;s highly unsaturated and rapidly oxidizes (becomes rancid). It inhibits proteases, impairing digestion and the renewal of proteins. It also inhibits desaturases and elongases, preventing you from synthesizing your own (omega 9) unsaturated fats. Fish are unintelligent, cold-blooded animals with very low metabolic rates; we should not be replacing our fats with theirs. Same with seeds. The reason that there are studies with titles and abstracts that claim benefits from fish oil, is that there are plenty of politically connected and powerful people selling fish oil. If you read the text of these studies it becomes clear that they are pseudo-science, and it&#039;s pretty easy to see through them. <br />Piracetam acts in many ways like glycine or GABA (to which it is very similar in structure), and is the most well studied nootropic by a wide margin. I consider it safe to take over a wide dosage range; it seems to &#039;tune&#039; your brain to a higher rate of metabolism, and its effects persist after cessation of use. <br />Psilocybin may be beneficial to take regularly, as it would likely decrease serotonergic activity. <br />I experimented extensively with nootropics when I was younger; I&#039;ve since come to understand that the ultimate nootropic is a diet high in fruit and mushrooms, which supports maximal energy flow and resilience. We should not be so presumptuous as to imagine that we can do a better job &#039;sculpting&#039; our brain with nootropics than our brains did at building themselves in the first place. <br />That said, supplementing with vitamins and metabolites found in or increased by an optimal diet (or those that directly antagoinze the effect of poor diet and environmental toxins) can sustainably improve brain function, which is the inspiration behind the supplements I&#039;ve been selling here for the last 2 years.
