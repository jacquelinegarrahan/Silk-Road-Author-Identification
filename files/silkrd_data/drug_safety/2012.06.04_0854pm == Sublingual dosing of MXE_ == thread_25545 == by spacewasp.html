				i&#039;ve had some MXE in my stash box for almost a year now and I think i&#039;m ready to give it a try.&nbsp; I&#039;m an experienced ketamine user, so I&#039;m not afraid of spacing out too far or anything like that, but I don&#039;t want to take so much that its unpleasant.<br /><br />what would be a good starting dose for a fist timer like me?&nbsp; <br /><br />also, do you take a booster dose ever, or just do it all up front?<br /><br />thanks!

				Since your experienced with ketamine I would say you should give 25-30mg a shot for your first time all at once so you can see what it&#039;s all about then if you need more just dose like 10mg or so more under your tongue. Ketamine&#039;s much better in my eye&#039;s tho but MXE is always a fun time :)

				thank you very much for the reply<br /><br />yeah, i honestly don&#039;t have high expectations for it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been feeling the urge to dissociate lately but my nose is not functioning properly lately (hella allergies) so ketamine is out...got some MXE sitting around, so what the hell, right?

				Visit this link if you want information on Methoxetamine:<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Methoxetamine<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Taking care when redosing is of great importance. The reason for this will be illustrated a bit more graphically:<br /><br />insufflation/snorting.<br /><br />~t+0.20 for the peak to begin<br />~t+2.00 for the peak to end<br />~t+4.00 for the after effects to pretty much end.<br /><br />The after effects take a very very long time to wear off and they are not insignificant effects by any means. Even 30 mins after the peak has &#039;ended&#039;, the effects may still be 70-80% as strong as they were during the peak. This means that redosing 10mg on a 50mg trip at this point will bring the experience right back up to the intensity it had been during the peak. Just from 10mg - and taking 20 mg would bring an, albeit, short, peak back but even higher than it had been during the first peak! After already experiencing a significant 2 hour peak, this can be quite unexpected and unwanted.<br /><br />the ^ represents a dosage taken<br />the @ represents the level of effects felt as its equivalent in mg for a certain time.<br /><br />This is approximate, but should give a good idea.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;t+0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+30.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+60.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+1.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+2.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+2.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+3.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+3.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+4.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+4.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+5.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+5.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t+6.00<br />^50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@80mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@70mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@60mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@35mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@20mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@10mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mild after effects&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very mild after effects<br />^50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@80mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@80mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^20mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@90mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@75mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@60mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@45mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@25mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@10mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mild after effects<br />In the above table, a reasonably large dose is started with- the main dose- and this is supplemented with smaller doses (although not quite small enough- 30 is a large re-dose). Even so, you can see that over time they stack up and cause 1 hour long 80mg experiences which is seriously high (not to be attempted by unexperienced users).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;t+0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+30.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+60.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+1.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+2.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+2.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+3.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+3.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+4.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+4.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+5.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+5.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+6.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+6.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+7.00<br />^50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^40mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@90mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@90mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^40mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@120mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@105mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@90mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@75mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@60mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@45mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@15mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mild after effects<br />The table above demonstrates an experience with higher redoses. Note with high dosages that the experience can last longer, especially the after effects. Even though the last dosage was taken at t+2.30, the effects continue until t+7.00. Even though they are mild at that point, see that even at the 5 hour mark the effects are on 60mg- still a significant dose and after tripping for so long, it can start to take its toll. Note also that the increments cause a peak of 120mg, which is seriously high (not to be attempted unless seriously experienced), and lessens very very slowly.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;t+0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+30.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+60.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+1.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+2.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+2.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+3.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+3.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+4.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+4.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t+5.00<br />^30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^10mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^10mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@50mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@40mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@30mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@10mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mild after effects&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The above table represents an &#039;ideal&#039; approach to redosing for unexperienced users. The main dose is started with, and then low redoses are taken (if desired- redosing is of course not a must, just something often done).<br /><br />Because of the long duration of methoxetamine, not appreciating the cumulative effects of redosing can result in an experience which is too intense. Furthermore, as Methoxetamine does not inhibit movement as much as ketamine, hurting yourself during freak-outs is especially dangerous. Additionally, whereas on ketamine you can look forward to coming down fast, on methoxetamine, especially high doses, the return to baseline is long and arduous.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				if you would let me borrow your nose, i would skip the MXE all together and just snort K.&nbsp; but since that defies all medical and physical logic I will be dosing sublingually

				To get the best absorption without plugging or IV, then sublingual is the way to go and it also will hit you just as quick as snorting basically..
