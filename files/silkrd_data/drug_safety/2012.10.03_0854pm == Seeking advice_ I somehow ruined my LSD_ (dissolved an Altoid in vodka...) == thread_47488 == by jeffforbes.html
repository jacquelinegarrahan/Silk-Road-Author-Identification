				I purchased an Altoid dosed with 200ug of LSD.<br /><br />My wife and I have not tried LSD before, we wanted to each have a 100ug dose.<br /><br />We dissolved the Altoid in some vodka (40%), then mixed in a small amount of water (treated city water, likely has chlorine), and then mixed in some powdered flavor crystals (some Vitamin C energy drink powder - had a bunch of vitamins in it)<br />I shook up the mix, then we drank the liquid, and experienced no effects from the LSD (this was days ago).<br /><br />Any ideas on what could have screwed up the acid?<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Edit: I have reason to believe that the seller provided me good LSD, based on the reviews of other buyers.

				you possibly diluted the LSD too much...next time just cut the Altoid in half, give your wife her share, and let the altoid melt in your mouths...<br /><br />LSD doesn&#039;t really have any taste...every time i&#039;ve done LSD i&#039;ve had success with ingesting it sublingually....

				I guzzled the liquid in three big gulps. The total amount was roughly 1/5 of a standard glass (half was vodka, half was water).<br /><br />You think the amount of dilution would affect how my digestive system absorbs the LSD?<br /><br />

				yeah you probably should of just cut it in half especially if you have no experience on the other hand its gonna take more than 50ug to trip seeing most are actually weaker than advertised

				you added a bunch of unnecessary steps in your consumption...the farthest i would go would be to soak a tab in shot glass of kool aid and swallow the whole thing tab and all...but normally i just let the tab sit on my tongue till it&#039;s pretty much mushy pulp that no longer resembles a square and then swallow it...<br /><br />what was your logic behind your elaborate cocktail?

				LSD is a fragile molecule...anything from heat to light to the chlorine in tap water will cause it to degrade...

				The Chlorine in tap water did it for sure. I&#039;m pretty sure LSD degrades almost instanty in the pressence of chlorine. Also, a single dose of LSD is very small, so it takes only a small amount of Chlorine to break down LSD.

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />Simply cutting the Altoid in half would have resulted in an uneven dosage for my wife and I. Dissolving the Altoid was the logical step to achieve two balanced doses.<br /><br />I did some research, and the sample of water I used does not contain Chlorine (our water treatment switched from Chlorine to Chloramine in the 1990&#039;s):<br /><br />My water contained 1 ppm of Chloramine (not Chlorine), and was only mixed with the LSD minutes before ingesting.<br /><br />Can anyone else speculate on whether this was my point of failure?<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Edit: Nevermind. I found this on wikipedia:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">LSD also has enamine-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, chlorine destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So it&#039;s probable that the Chloramine (which I suspect has similar properties to Chlorine) reacted with my LSD. Crummy.
