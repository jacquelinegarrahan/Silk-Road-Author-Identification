				Heroin is great, but it&#039;s not that relaxing... I mean it IS, but you nod and you can&#039;t really DO anything on it.<br /><br />Marijuana is also great, but it&#039;s not strong enough. Nor does it help with body aches as much as heroin.<br /><br />What about opium? Anyone have any other opinions?

				Does it have to be something illicit per se?<br /><br />I love winding down with a beer and some cigarettes really. <br /><br />After that i&#039;ll opt for a night of good sleep with a small dose of benzo&#039;s (yeah, i know they should not be taken with alcohol) or perhaps a nice night out on ephedrine or cocaine. <br /><br />Smoking some pot may be a really good idea if you just want to chill out and go to bed though.

I just wish there was something that didn&#039;t melt away your brain, but still left your body feeling like pudding. Heroin makes you feel like that, but it melts away your brain too. Benzos just aren&#039;t strong enough, nor do they really help with &quot;aches&quot;. I guess I&#039;ll try that opium and hash idea... : 8)

				I didn&#039;t properly measure... but I took about 20-30mg of MXE orally. It&#039;s pretty relaxing and helps a bit with pain. I&#039;ve had some bad experiences on MXE, where the start is nice and the end isn&#039;t so nice, so I may need to adjust the dose accordingly. I&#039;ll remember how much I use exactly next time. Lol.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also be sure to update you guys if I do feel shitty. I&#039;ve only had really crappy experiences with drugs lately and it&#039;s starting to suck. Each trip has sucked, and the only drug that has brought any relaxation is marijuana, as per usual.<br /><br />Here&#039;s hoping for some luck on a smaller dose. I was trying to only take 20mg, but I think I accidentally took 30mg, MAYBE more (but probably not).<br /><br /><br />FYI, it tastes like shit, so cap it. I was GOING to take it sublingually, but I couldn&#039;t bear the taste and almost barfed. Swallowed it and about 20 minutes later the effects hit. My head is nice and floaty and my body feels heavy and light at the same time. It&#039;s a pretty nice feeling mixed with some good weed.<br /><br />I have a feeling mixing opium/hash with a little less MXE would be really nice... (10mg MXE maybe).
