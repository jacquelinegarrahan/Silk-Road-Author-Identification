				Title: <strong>Synthetic cocaine</strong><br />

				&nbsp;An extract from Alexander Shulgin - Drugs of Abuse in the Future<br /><br />cocaine (21). There appears to be a recent increase in popularity and usage of the drug, although much of that which is claimed to be cocaine is extensively diluted with procaine 160] and methedrine <br />[61]. Classically the drug has been obtained from the Coca tree, which is native to South America. However, the growing <br />popularity of the drug and the extremely high price demanded in illicit trade have attracted the attention of the underground <br />synthetic chemists, and there is indeed evidence that the drug is currently being synthesized [62]. It is true that cocaine of legitimate <br />commerce is already semisynthetic. The crude coca alkaloids are saponified to the compound ecgonine, which can be easily <br />reconstituted to pure cocaine by benzoylation and esterification with methyl alcohol.<br />&nbsp;<br />The total synthesis of ecgonine (and thus of cocaine) is more tedious. However, the procedures have been in the chemical literature <br />for decades (63) and employ easily available starting materials.<br /><br /><br />Are there any cocaine users that have experienced this first hand?

				NO!<br /><br />Soooooo curious, though.<br /><br />My buddy stayed in Tokyo longer than I did when we were out visiting last summer and he told me he came across some crazy kind of synthetic coke they call &quot;Wheelie&quot; <br /><br />Some Aussie he met that had pointed him in the right direction to get high in the first place told him to just do a bump, so of course he did a fat rail and was high for some ten hours, wound up partying with a bunch of tatted-up Yakuza gangsters kicking their asses at foos-ball. Fucking hysterical.
