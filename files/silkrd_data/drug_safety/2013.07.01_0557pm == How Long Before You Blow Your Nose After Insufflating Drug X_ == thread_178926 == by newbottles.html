				I will use H #4 insufflated as an example.&nbsp; <br /><br />It occurs to me that after a certain amount of time, the drug has been absorbed to a maximum, and you can expel all the remaining stuff in your nose without losing any active drug.&nbsp; This could be simply blowing your nose, or neti pot/saline solution.<br /><br />Does anyone have an informed opinion on how long to wait?<br /><br />I would assume there would be interest here in timing for insufflated H, cocaine, methamphetamine.<br /><br />I really discourage insufflating pills but that is clearly fair game too.<br /><br />The general idea here is trying to be proactive in keeping your nose in decent shape while you are snorting drugs every day for a period of time.

				I always just snort some Simply Saline after I&#039;ve been doing coke all night, and I keep doing it until I can&#039;t taste the coke anymore, only the saline. The saline spray has the added benefit of helping me absorb (and subsequently get high off of) all the coke that&#039;s trapped up in my nose. So I would just do that until I&#039;m sure there&#039;s no more up there, before blowing my nose.<br /><br />Never done H, but I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s a &quot;taste&quot; to it. Just use the saline spray or neti pot til you can&#039;t taste the drug anymore.

				Snorting substances like meth, H, or cocaine.. for the most part, are entirely absorbed into your blood stream with in mere minutes. 15-20 min at the longest id say. <br /><br />Anything that may be caked up in your nose, would be cut.&nbsp; The reality of your query though, is that even if you where to blow your nose soon after snorting something, the amount of product wasted, if any at all really, will not be significant enough to actually do anything for you, had you let that extra 1/2mg stay gooked in your nose. LOL

				I always wait 30 minutes before blowing my nose.<br />Once, when I started using MDMA, I snorted a crushed pill (which you should never do!) and the green food coloring shit came out of my nose when blowing it even two days later!

				Yeah I always wondered the same.<br /><br />What about sneezing? If I sneeze right after snorting, does this means I lost all or most of the powder?

				I&#039;ve only ever snorted heroin and mxe, and while I found the heroin to be much nicer on the nose, I still felt the need to blow my nose after about 15-20 minutes, no matter the substance. However, I feel that once the drip is mostly gone, it&#039;s safe to say that most of the active chemical has been absorbed.<br /><br />However, given that I know my mxe is near 100% purity, it still puzzles me why I get so much mxe boogers if I snort it. I prefer sublingual absorbtion of mxe for that very reason.
