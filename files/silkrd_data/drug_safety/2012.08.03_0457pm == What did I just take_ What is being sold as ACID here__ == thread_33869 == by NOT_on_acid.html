				Hellow Guys!<br /><br />I took half of a &quot;150ug LSD Hoffmann&quot; Blotter I bought here like 2 hrs ago.<br />Now I am somewhat &quot;high&quot; but no way this is LSD. I have a weird body load, mind mostly clear, but hard to focus, no optical or auditory distortions.<br />I have done quite a bit of LSD in my time, although most was in the late 90&#039;s early 2000&#039;s. I&#039;m sure THIS is not lsd.<br />The whole thing really feels like a lame attempt to imitate LSD.<br /><br />So what is commonly sold as LSD on here?! Any Research Chemicals? Rat Poison? ?!?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I really appreciate all the help I am receiving here lol, <br /><br />Maybe some cannabinoid (n00b here) that can be sold as liquid/on blotter? It feels a bit like weed, but only slightly. <br /><br />maybe I should add more weed?<br /><br />I could make a live trip report while everyone is guessing what I am on - like a game show! <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t that be fun? If you guess it right the ER will be able to safe me&nbsp; ;D

				Hoffman&#039;s are typically mass produced and I&#039;ve only tripped off eating 2 of them. I was very underwhelmed with 1.<br /><br />Acid today is not like it was back in the day. Check out the Jannis review thread, they seem to go into detail about this.

				Did it make your tongue or mouth numb?&nbsp; There&#039;s supposedly a lot of dealers selling 25i-NBOMe on blotters and calling it acid, because its much cheaper and easier to make (= more profits)<br /><br />If the come up was around 20 min or less and you get numbness in your mouth it&#039;s likely you got one of these 25x blotters.<br /><br />Also if you just straight up swallow the tab and don&#039;t feel any effects its DEFINITELY a 25x of some kind.

There is still some VERY clean and VERY potent liquid LSD available, although I havn&#039;t seen it here. Just take a trip to San Francisco, and ye shall be rewarded! (or Burning Man)
