				Hi friends I have been a Heroin user for nearly 10 years having used mainly in western Canada and Netherlands I have never been exposed to BTH , I now have access it to it some questions .<br />Does the quality vary a lot ? it seems as though it might be harder to cut ? is the dose about the same as good quality #4 .1 to .2 for a safe starting point ?<br />IS it simply cooked on a spoon ? does it break down easily ? is it like #3 do I have to ad citric acid or white vinagar ? <br />These might seem like stupid question but I sincerely have no idea <br />will it stay suspended in a vial I have noticed folks selling it ready to inject on the site <br />will the suspended H be so dark that its hard to see blood when I hit a vein ?<br /><br />Thanks for your help <br />Sincerely <br />GF

				I&#039;ve seen people just take the black tar heroin, melt it in a spoon, and shoot it up. Also, be careful, heroin is pretty addictive if you don&#039;t take it in moderation.

				I was waiting for someone else to answer, I cannot let cyberscour be the only answer. No offense CS but just melting tar down and injecting it into you is a horrible idea. I hope you meant that there was to be water added to melt it down?<br /><br />I am assuming you have a tolerance? Because .1 of good #4 is not a good starting point if you don&#039;t, you would probably OD and die...&nbsp; <br />I would say for NO tolerance .5 is a good starting point for tar. if you have a tolerance .1/1.5/.2 ... This is for really good tar.<br /><br />BTH is cut to shit most of the time. Sometimes not. I do not live on the west coast so I have no idea about the ratio of great to horrible tar in general, but it is very crude to begin with and even the best black tar will never be as good as the best #4.<br /><br />To cook BTH you add water, just like powder, filter and shoot. You do not need to heat it, but a lot of people do (same as #4).<br /><br />You do not have to add any acid, it is already pretty acidic to begin with because of the process, but it&#039;s completely soluble in water just like number 4.<br /><br />I do not completely understand your question about the vial, but the people selling tar on here in a vial have filtered it very well and use bacteriostatic water which has alcohol in it to prevent the growth of bacteria. It is not a good idea to just mix up tar and water and leave it sitting to take as you please over the course of however long, nor any other drug for that matter, because it could possibly grow bacteria and be very harmful to your health and maybe cause death? I don&#039;t know and I would rather not find out. Mix it up when you need it. Tar can be extremely filthy and if it is moist and has been stepped on many times that is pretty much a breeding ground for bacteria to begin with so.. You get the idea? In my experience the drier the better, but I&#039;ve only done it off SR and only 4 or 5 different ones.<br /><br />Tar has different colours ranging from dark amber to golden, anywhere in between. This I believe has to do with the quality and what it is cut with and how much tar:water you use in your shot.<br /><br />Good luck and don&#039;t miss.

				Thanks for the reply yes I&nbsp; :( sadly&nbsp; I have a mean tolerance I was living for most of heroin use in Vancouver BC or Amsterdam NL after reading your post it makes me perhaps shy away from buying BTH , I am currently on 70 mg meathadone twice daily .<br />I have been reducing that drastically recently in anticipation of getting some decent H , I am tired of blocked receptors and PAIN !<br />I was planning of ordering some BTH from the company although the price certainly is high considering I can get #4 for less $ <br />I was under the impression that I was missing something when it comes to BTH&nbsp; the first Heroin I ever did was China white in the early 90&#039;s in BC that was sold in match heads snorting 1/3 of a match head would put me on my ass .<br />Thanks very much for the assistance <br />GF

				Thanks for asking this question, GF. I am like you,&nbsp; I have never been exposed to BTH until now. I have a lot of the same questions you do about it.<br /><br />The prices on SR have got me down a bit. Since its what I&#039;m used to, I&#039;d rather stick with #4 and shy away from BTH, because I havn&#039;t heard very great things about it. I am used to getting stamp bags at $10-15 a pop, $20 MAX, and I keep my tolerance low, so I only really need 1 bag for a proper dose, but many of my friends regularly blast 3-6 bags at a time, I had a friend that would shoot a bundle at a time. The H where I live has run dry for me, so I have turned to SR for my cravings, and it is just crazy how much this stuff costs here. I don&#039;t see how anyone could sustain an H habit like some of my friends have, shooting as much dope as the do, from the SR. Unless, I don&#039;t know, the quality is so high you don&#039;t need much or everyone who uses SR is rich or only a couple times a month casual user.<br /><br />A stamp bag is usually about .1g, right? People are selling the same amount of BTH, which is supposed to be a lower quality than what I am used to, on SR for double the price on the street, and that doesn&#039;t even include shipping and fees to get bitcoins. So its like the price is tripled, and I can only hope the H is of a high quality.<br /><br />I made my first SR purchase on&nbsp; Dec. 31, I got .5gs of &quot;Gunpowder&quot; BTH from Einstien...product has still not shipped. I am excited to try it and see how it compares to what I am used to. From what I have been reading, it might take me a while to get that order, so in the mean time I think I am going to order .25 of #4 from supremesmoke for an astronomical $93, not including shipping. I am hoping it will be pure as hell so I can cut it up and maybe turn it into 5 bags for myself or something. After that I want to try Hatter&#039;s ready to shoot solution, which I believe you were asking about in your question. I guess Hatter&#039;s picture answers it for us, BTH will stay suspended in a vial.<br /><br />Well, let me know how your orders and experience go. Where did you find #4 cheaper than BTH, if you don&#039;t mind me asking? Or is that just on the street in your area.

				I have a related question about BTH so maybe someone can answer me too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really have the know how or desire to shoot the stuff but I do like smoking it on foil (think its called chasing the dragon). <br /><br />Can anyone tell me the best way to smoke BTH on foil?&nbsp; Like what is the best way to smoke BTH and get the most bang for your buck?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read other post about people mixing cocaine with some water on foil and letting it dry for 30 min and then smoking.&nbsp; All I have been doing is making a little line of the powder on foil and holding a liter about an inch under the foil and inhaling through a straw.&nbsp; I feel like I might be burning it up too fast and wasting it so if any of you more experienced folks could help me out it would be much appreciated!

				Hi thanks for the reply Boss and Lupen both have #4 H for far less it has not arrived yet , also I am in Canada so frank mathews also ships to me .<br />I have ordered over $1100 worth of H recently mostly from frank because his feedback is really high I also ordered #4 from Boss and I will order a sample from Lupen and see if I get anything , I ordered a .5 from thecompany to try the BTH before buying any amount of it .<br />I have lived in Canada and Netherlands in the past few years and I will tell you the dope in NL is the best I have had I am told the the Italian dope is the same , do not hesitate to buy #3 from NL and use Citric acid or vinager to prep it , in NL tests on the #3 street dope is most often between 40-60% purity , I would like to think that SR has the best of the best I will say I never purchased #4 in NL in the past .<br />GF

				Somniferus, Here is a post by Motek that was posted a couple of days ago (or yesterday) on the &quot;h3ЯØ|n Vendors&quot; Thread about smoking H:<br /><br /><br />&quot;hi everyone first post....hmmm now motek likes to shoot coz it&#039;s better &#039;bang for your buck&#039; but smoking is a great way to get stoned also, and it&#039;s easier to have several little doses if you&#039;re unsure of the strength<br /><br />After all, like the saying goes, &quot;&#039;tis better two holes in your arm, than one in the ground!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Smoking H on foil is a bit of a skill that takes a little practice.<br /><br />Q&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why don&#039;t folks use glass pipes with the &#039;bubble&#039; on one end, like used for meth&quot;&nbsp; They are PERFECT as they &#039;trap&#039; the smoke AND the glass holds the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;temperature better than foil, so you&#039;re &#039;control&#039; over the burn is better<br /><br />in principle you are &#039;vaporizing&#039; the gear, To do so, you take a small (half a match head~ a fifth of a point=0.02g) amount of dope and hold a flame under it while breathing in the vapor through a tube of some kind---some folks like to use a straw IMO they are too skinny, a tube of paper about 10cms long rolled into a cone (paper money rolled &#039;longwise&#039; works ok, trial and error is required when there&#039;s no one to show you)<br /><br />Heat the dope gently as it WILL SUDDENLY melt and then hit it&#039;s vapor point turning into a BIG cloud of &#039;smoke&#039; which is sometimes too big/much and so you will waste some (which is almost inevitable with your first few spots)<br /><br />You will eventually find the amount that suits you...ideally an amount you can take all at once.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don&#039;t get all the dope vaped the first &#039;burn&#039; you can repeat until you have a charred black spot on the foil, which wont give any more smoke<br /><br /><br />NB:&nbsp; Some tin foil has some kind of coating that will burn off the first time you heat it, so test the foil you&nbsp; use to see if this is the case...idk what the stuff is, maybe some kind of oil to stop the foil sticking on the roll, (but it probably isn&#039;t that good for you)<br /><br /><br />In moteks experience, spending a few bucks on a glass &quot;meth type &#039;bubble ended&#039; pipe WILL save you much grief, if you have to use foil, the Rule is ALWAYS DO several SMALL SPOTS rather than a big one.<br /><br />&quot;chasing the dragon&quot;&nbsp; which is technically &quot;chasing after a bubbling line of vaporizing gear along a piece of tinfoil&quot;&nbsp; which is fine IF you can afford to put 0.2+gm on the foil, BUT, you WILL see a large percentage of it NOT go into the tube you are sucking it up through.<br /><br />Hope this helps&quot;

				H,<br /><br />Thanks for this post.&nbsp; From what I can gather it seems like I am just putting too much&nbsp; on the foil to start with.&nbsp; What happens to me as I try to heat it slowly is one large bubble appears on the foil with very little smoke. It&#039;s like the H forms a thick layer and it becomes hard to vaporize.&nbsp; When it finally gets hot enough it burns up too quickly. I&#039;ll try with a smaller spot and see how that works out.<br /><br />

				No problem. Let me know if you master the art of smoking and how you have..<br /><br />I find I have similar issues with trying to smoke tar, though I do get a lot of smoke. It&#039;s like it will turn liquid and start off fine, but it won&#039;t run and then immediately burns.. And if I can get it to run it then stops after an inch or centimeter or so and burns&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; so apparently I&#039;m doing something wrong.<br />I was thinking maybe trying a soda can or something because it&#039;s thicker.. I have tried folding foil in half to double it up, but it&#039;s almost too thick and won&#039;t smoke. Maybe it just took too long to heat. <br />If you have some good glass that might work, it&#039;d be better for your throat and lungs too. I don&#039;t know where you get your tar, but hatter&#039;s comes in a glass vial and to get use out of all the dust left in it I actually heated up the vial itself (after making a handle out of paperclip so I didn&#039;t burn myself). That worked well... but it has nowhere to run really, luckily there was only a little.<br /><br />I think it must take some patience, which doesn&#039;t really mix well with doing drugs haha
