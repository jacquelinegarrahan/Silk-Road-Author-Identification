				I have a 100mcg/g 72hour patch here.<br /><br />I have a 1/2g a day habbit of some decent quality H. Withdrawals are a bitch for anyone who has to go through them and I want to minimize them as much as possible.<br />The first 3-4 days are the WORST and after that it starts to get a little better.<br /><br />With suboxone ya know if you take those for the first 3 days then stop you only have a few more days to go before your not sick. So will it be the same with the patch will I only have a few more days or will I take the patch and then be on day 1 and have to deal with a week of WDs?<br /><br />I have some methadone but not enough to cover all of the WDs. So my plan was to take the patch then take the methadone after and then stop opiates and i&#039;ll be good.<br /><br />Will this work or should I just try and sell the patch and use the money to get more dope? haha jk

				Fentanyl is something like 100 times stronger than H.<br /><br />Chances are you will be just trading one opiate for another.&nbsp; The methadone would be a better option, but only if you taper it.&nbsp; If you had 100mg of meth you would take 30 the first day, 25 the next day, 20 the day after and so on until you were finally finished.&nbsp; I would take it in the evening so you can sleep, instead of taking it during the day.&nbsp; You would probably still feel some discomfort during the day, but nowhere near what you would normally feel.<br /><br />A few years ago I did basically the same thing, with pretty much the identical tolerance you have (1/2g a day).&nbsp; The first 3 days was shit until I managed to get some meth and I did exactly what I said above, tapering it over several days, taking 5mg on the last day.&nbsp; I was still not felling 100% at the end, but it was at least endurable by that point, no more restless leg and I could sleep.

				NO! Hell no! Fentanyl is extremely strong, and extremely short lasting (short half-life, aka a lot like Heroin) so no, absolutely not is the answer to the thread title.&nbsp; You should get on suboxone, administered by a doctor. If you are determined to get through WDs on your own, maybe some Kratom would be advisable (I&#039;m happy to tell you more bout Krat if you are unaware of it) but aside from that you should not take a different short acting, potent opioid to get off H. Depending on how bad the WDs will be, well you should definitely consider Krat as long as you make sure not to get hooked on that herbal opioid, but my actual reccomendation would be to go to a doctor or a decent clinic and get on suboxone, fuck that Fentanyl patch. I&#039;ve had those in the hospital for serious shoulder dislocations, they are practically instant, intense drug that is very fleeting, how would that help you kick dope? Just get on subs, from a doctor.

				Swapping 1 Opiate for another is a ridiculous idea anyway and fundamentally why Methadone doesn&#039;t work in any way. <br /><br />If you wana kick the Junk just be a man about it and have someone lock you in a room with food and water and everything you need for up to a week.

But if you use them for only a few days to a week to avoid getting sick then they are miracle workers.<br /><br />The only problem is that sub isn&#039;t strong enough for my level of tolerance. So for the first few days I need something else.<br />Locking myself in a room is a really terrible idea. For starters its good to try and get out and go for walks and exercise if possible. And quitting cold turkey for someone at my level is really really bad for the body. I don&#039;t think you realize how sick one can get. My immune system would go to shit, the stress hormones that would release have more profound effects than you&#039;d think. That is why a doctor will not recommend a cold turkey quit. Which I have done 2 times before and it was truly aweful. Especially cause my girlfriend didn&#039;t understand and kept hounding me for sex and got mad when I wouldn&#039;t do it. Its not a matter of &quot;manning up&quot; it simply isn&#039;t healthy.<br /><br />

				Yeah I&#039;m sure it does work really well but you can&#039;t change the fact you are swapping one thing for another. So yes, I do know what I am talking about especially considering you just said &quot;I have to admit though the recommended usage of taking them long term is a really bad idea&quot; <br /><br />And yeah so what? It might be shit for the body but then so is being a junky. You need to suffer to remind you why you shouldn&#039;t do it. Harsh but true. <br /><br />So yeah, man the fuck up.

				There is one other thing you can do if you want to lessen the effects of the WD&#039;s.&nbsp; Find yourself one of those bulk food places and buy a 3 or 4 pounds of poppy seeds, then look on the internet for &#039;Poppy Seed Tea&#039;.<br /><br />When I&#039;ve done a little too much H and driven my tolerance up too high, and then stop doing H, I&#039;ll make some poppy tea.&nbsp; When I first read about it I was a little skeptical, but it actually works.&nbsp; One minute I would be feeling crappy from the WD&#039;s and 15 minutes later I was feeling fine.&nbsp; A few nights of tea, a little less each night, and I had gotten over the worst of the WD&#039;s.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t enough in the tea to bring your tolerance up again (unless you start doing huge amounts), but there is enough to help you get through the WD&#039;s.<br /><br />

Another similarity is both WD medicines are addictive in themselves, but if you really are determined to do this on your own order some Kratom, probably wont make you feel great with that kind of tolerance but will make WDs tolerable at the very least, and is so much less addictive itself than those much more potent painkillers.

				Stupid Idea, remeber half the battle is what you truly BELIEVE<br />Best advice I can give you is switch over to something like percocet for a week then gradually taper down, and go through your 3 days of withdrawl<br />with oxycodone at least I don&#039;t puke etc etc I&#039;m just tired and bored with life then I&#039;m good<br />P.s I&#039;ve been useing opiates for over 4 years.

				My suggestion would be to get some comfort meds<br /><br />Things to help you through the withdrawal<br /><br />1. Kratom - it surprisingly works, I was coming off an 8 year heroin habit and I was REALLY surprised Kratom worked, however you can get physically addicted to it (although the withdrawal is obviously not nearly as intense as heroin) so don&#039;t use it for a long period of time<br />2. Loperamide - Google it and you&#039;ll see that it can be effective in comforting withdrawal<br />3. Valium<br />4. DXM - I used to drink cough syrup during heroin withdrawal and it really helped<br /><br />If you use Suboxone, try and do a fast taper with it otherwise you might end up trading one opiate addiction for another. I have been on both Methadone and Suboxone for long-term maintenance therapy and while it works well for getting you life back on track, attending treatment, dealing with legal issues, and adjusting to being without heroin....it&#039;s still an opiate.<br /><br />Anyways good luck man, heroin withdrawal can be tough and it&#039;s different for everyone...but you&#039;ll get through it! There&#039;s plenty of people in the world going through the exact same situation.<br /><br /><br />

				Oh yeah, forgot to mention:<br /><br />Clonidine - I used it a couple of times and at first I thought it wasn&#039;t doing anything but then noticed it helped make the withdrawal a lot less intense...it&#039;s kinda hard to explain but it can help<br />Tramadol - I will usually take 150mg before bed because it helps with restless leg and other symptoms...be very careful with it though and only take it for 3 or so days because last thing you want to do is trade a heroin addiction for a Tramadol addiction
