				Title: <strong>Fentanyl calculations</strong><br />

				Hi,<br /><br />Seen a couple of new listings for Fentanyl.&nbsp; One for ampules, the other for sub-lingual tabs.<br /><br />The ampule calculation seems fairly straight forward.&nbsp; They are .5g of fent in 10ml of liquid.&nbsp; That works out to 500mcg of fent in 10ml or 50mcg/ml.&nbsp; Meant to be injected into an IV bag (probably with a 1L/500ml bag of saline or just sterile water).&nbsp; So the amps would have to be diluted into 1L of sterile water to get a .5mcg/1ml ratio so that a full 100cc syringe would have 50mcg of fent in it.&nbsp; From what I could see about dosage, for severe pain they say 50-100mcg every 2 hours.&nbsp; So 50cc of diluted fent (25mcg) should be a safe first dose, correct.<br /><br />The tabs on the other hand seem to be suicide tabs. 800mcg of fent in one sub-lingual tab would probably drop anybody but the heaviest opiate user.&nbsp; I see reference to dosages for tolerant patients starting at 100-200mcg.&nbsp; How would you go about diluting one of these tabs?&nbsp; Simply dissolve it in a calculated amount sterile water?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any immediate plans on doing this stuff (I might have gone for the powder from aromatics, as most of the reviews were positive and it only involved smoking, but the listing disappeared), I am just curious right now.<br /><br />Anybody knowledgeable about fent ready with an answer?<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				ok.. with the fentanyl liquid is the one that you really have to be careful with. that is something that i wouldnt mess with unless you know what the&nbsp; fuck you are doing and are very tolerant.<br /><br />the actiq (1200mc) is on the bigger side. orally, you are only going to get 1/2 of that dose at the most. so you really are going to ingest 600mcg of fent. still a big dose..<br /><br />Now with the sublingual. this is where people have died. 800mcg is like having a 1800mcg sucker or higher. there were a lot of od&#039;s when fentora came out. (same thing) docs would give their patients the same dose. so if they were on actiq at 800 mcg they would give them an 800 mcg sublingual tab.. the tabs are much more potent than you would think.. Thats why the biggest they make is 800mcg yet the make a 1600mcg sucker.<br /><br />Did that make sense?

				Yes, pretty much what I thought.&nbsp; I can certainly see people screwing up with the g to mcg and mcg/ml calculations.&nbsp; One mistake and it&#039;s all over.&nbsp; <br /><br />My tolerance isn&#039;t what it used to be, back in the day when I could get 200 80&#039;s every month, then found a good supplier for light brown H when the 80&#039;s disappeared.&nbsp; But that&#039;s a good thing, by the time your tolerance is that high, all you are doing is maintaining, about the only time you can get a good nod is that first hit after you have been without for a few days.<br /><br />I&#039;ll skip the fent and stick with the occasional IR&#039;s and other fine, but safer, consumables.<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				thats smart, plus if you use fent. your tolerance skyrockets much faster than traditional ir meds.

				i can vouch for aromatics stuff, got some right here actually&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />i have a small op tolerance (ie snort 30-40 mg oxy to get nicely fucked up occasionally)<br /><br />i have found snorting alittle more then 10mg of the 100/1 ratio fent works awesome<br /><br />short duration makes it hard not to redose tho :(
