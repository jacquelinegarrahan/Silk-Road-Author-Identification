				I had a hell of a trip with 10mg 2c-e and 15mg 2c-i, mixed together.<br />The 2 people I was with had a much better trip but only one of them had what might be called a good trip.<br /><br />I had taken MDMA only 2 weeks prior and I blame that, and differences in bodychemistry to my experience.<br />In general I was not in control, I still do not remember bits of my trip. And the bits I do remember were somewhat mindfuckish.<br />I had auditory hallucinations (helicopter passing over (a few times) chattering teeth (other peoples), etc). I expected the 2c-i to make sure that the 2c-e trip stayed happy and good. Well that failed, miserably. <br /><br />When I more or less regained control of myself (as I was coming down), about 6 hours after dosing I was still very tripped out. I realized I had chipped one of my front teeth quite nicely. One of my freinds had lost a lens of his glasses and a screw had popped out. For the next hour I worried that we had been tripped out of our minds for days and that we were losing our teeth like methheads. I checked my freinds&#039; friends teeth (which was weird). I did not know that the female with us had a previous chip in her teeth, so as soon as I saw that I flipped. I got really worried that I had caused permanent damage to myself and these other people. They eventually got me talked down and I finished the trip nicely. (though the other male attempted suicide early in the trip, it was a pretty half-assed thing though (one of the crappiest attempts I&#039;ve ever seen)).<br /><br />It was VERY visual, many paintings (of airplanes (I have a few)) looked like those handheld &quot;hologram&quot; things that you tilt back and forth and they move a bit. Things moved and there were new colors and shit was off the wall. To quote a &#039;Talking Heads&#039; song, &quot;and things were looking like a movie&quot;. That was pretty cool.<br /><br />The weirdest thing though, was that sometimes time would get really choppy and glitchy. It was like a video that was buffering every so slightly. It wasent like time just slowed, but rather progressed in little stunted increments. Has anyone else experienced this? <br />Is there a name for this phenomenon?<br />Usually this only lasted for a few moments.<br /><br />Either way, it was PRETTY fucked up, the bits I do remember were wild and I went all kinds of inside and outside my own mind. I didn&#039;t really have fun throughout most of it. Not an experience I want to repeat.

				Oh I just rolled on mdma this weekend. Should I wait a while before trying 2c-i? I was thinking of trying some in a few weeks.

				Nah, 2c-i was my first psychedelic. Just start with 10-15mg and you&#039;ll have a great time. But watch out with 2c-e and any 2c-x mixes.

Come-up was under an hour and was feeling affects within 20 minutes. It was kind of uncomfortable though, sort of aggressive so I&#039;ll be taking a little ghb with it next time (to keep my muscles and mind relaxed and happy until I finally peak).

				I did find that time was moving a lot slower for me (happens with mdma too). Five minutes felt closer to an hour during some instances. It eased quite a bit when I took some ghb about 4 hours after initial 2c-i dose. <br /><br />That combo was very nice by the way; I had that skin-high going and when the ghb kicked in I was feeling warm and tingly in the muscles as if I just spent time in a spa. I think the 2c-i enhanced that into a kind of muscle-high (if you can imagine that). I fell asleep feeling very good inside and out.
