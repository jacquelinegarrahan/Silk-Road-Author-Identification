				So last night I was hanging out with some good friends and one of them had a real hard time keeping themselves together after eating some shrooms. Kind of a new experience for me as I have never seen someone have such a bad trip before, they only dosed a minor amount, but for whatever reason there was no calming this person down. I prefer to ride things out on my trips, but having something around just for these instances would not be a bad idea I think. I am very lost with all the options out there, anyone have any input?

				Xanax and klonopins<br /><br />Valiums are great and I love them but they are weak and you start dosing them high to get the same effect real quick.&nbsp; Then there&#039;s the greater chance you will get addicted to them.&nbsp; Same thing with xanax so use it only when needed.&nbsp; Clonazepam takes longer to hit but lasts 6-12 hours.

				Xanax is probably the best choice here: it&#039;s has very rapid onset and is available widely. It kicks in faster then valium does, and also breaks down a lot faster (the half life for valium and its metabolites is a whopping 2 days!). <br /><br />Flunitrazepam would certainly be effective, but is more difficult to obtain due to its reputation as the &#039;date rape&#039; drug. <br /><br />Clonazepam is slower in onset time, so probably not preferred. Substances like nitrazepam and temazepam are good candidates too though, since their time of onset is usually fast, but their half life is not -that- long. Midazolam would probably also be preferable since it has both quick onset and quick breakdown, but its not a very common substance.

				Alprazolam by far. It will kick in within 20 minutes. <br /><br />Clonazepam doesn&#039;t work for me at all. One time i was coming down off crystal and all i had were some 2mg pins. I knocked down 7 of those within a two hour span and nothing. Had to close the deal with a half pint of vodka just to get some freakin shut eye

Something like clonazepam is fine if you take take it a bit before you are going to do something that triggers anxiety. <br /><br />One thing that made alprazolam so popular when it was introduced is its rapid onset of action. Taken on an empty stomach this can be as fast as 10 minutes to achieve 90% effectiveness. Surely this can be delayed if you just had a heavy meal, but even then it mostly takes full effect within an hour or so. <br /><br />Substances like clonazepam and diazepam can be just as effective at lower cost in situations where you can afford to wait. In case of a rapid effect needed alprazolam is superior though, unless you are sure the person requiring treatment has not eaten for a while, in which case diazepam may be slightly faster.

				They are the same thing, but strictly Valium is produced by Roche or licensees, while the exact same substance manufactured by others is labeled &#039;benzodiazepam&#039; or some creative house brand name.

				I suppose most people will favor alprazolam due to its relatively short halflife and common availability. <br /><br />While its not prescribed very often anymore in europe, it remains one of the most succesful drugs ever marketed, and for good reason.

				Relative potencies are sometimes hard to interpret. <br /><br />Where alprazolam vs diazepam is concerned, it depends on what aspect you are looking at:<br /><br />- as an anxiolytic, alprazolam is about 20 times more potent compared to diazepam<br />- as a&nbsp; hypnotic, alprazlolam is about 10 times more potent compared to diazepam<br /><br />The muscle relaxant properties probably follow the figures stated for hypnotic properties. <br /><br />Considering all that, the proper ratio&#039;s of efficacy per milligram just depend on the desired effect. If you consider diazepam to be the &#039;default benzo&#039;, its clear that alprazolam has a more anxiolytic profile. This is obviously beneficial if you take it against anxiety, but not that good if you take it against insomnia. <br />

				thats very interesting, i did not know that it was the anxiolytic vs hypnotic properties that varied in the equivalent dosages.<br /><br />since i suffer from severe anxiety much of the high i get from benzos is the relief and relaxation of my worries melting away, which makes sense why i always considered xanax and kpins to be up to twenty times stronger mg for mg than valium. <br /><br />(oh and in my last post i worded it incorrectly, making it sound like valium was stronger but i think everyone knew what i meant because i listed the doses too, just to clarify though)&nbsp;

				It&#039;s never too late to discover something :)<br /><br />The mechanism of action of all benzodiazepines is comparable, but some are more anxiolytic where others are more hypnotic. <br /><br />Also, development of tolerance to either aspect is different: it has been clearly demonstrated that tolerance towards the hypnotic effects of xanax develop fairly quickly, but tolerance towards the anxiolytic properties develops very slowly, or not even at all. <br /><br />If you take xanax to treat anxiety this basically means that the drowsiness will subside after some time of use, while the reduction in anxiety remains. This is obviously good news for anyone taking it for anxiety problems, but bad news for those that take it mainly to fall asleep at night. Looking into the details of tolerance development is a good idea if you plan to take something to treat a medical problem compared to occasional recreational use.

				And if you&#039;re going alprazolam/xanax....i&#039;d advise avoiding the TRANAX brand (india) and go with ksalol (serbian made) 1 mg&#039;s. These are the most potent i&#039;ve found....possibly more potent than the blue footballs made my pfizer....

				If they contain what it says on the label they should all be equally potent.<br /><br />I&#039;ve fround Trika branded tablets from india to be as effective as any other genuine brand ones.

				I was referring to someone posting that because 20mg valium = 1mg xanax that xanax is a substance that is 20 times stronger than valium. That is simply false, extremely false, you just have to recalibrate the mg dosage and yes they are all unique and effect everyone differently im not suprised k pin is your favorite, I like it a lot I just require an abnormally high dose with that particular benzo to get a significant effect.

FOR ME when comparing the anxiolytic properties they produce <br /><br />i never said the potency of xanax is twenty times stronger than valium for everyone. please read my posts which i tried to quote for you<br /><br />but even still i think that is exactly what it means. NOW talking about in general and not my experience: what do the equivalent dosages mean then??<br />even still the equivalent dosages for anxiolytic properties as Ben mentioned is 20 mg to 1 mg.&nbsp; that seems to mean given the equivalent dosages the anxiolytic effects ARE twenty times stronger because you need twenty times more to produce the same effect (dont use your own experience or how strong they feel to you, i am talking about the equivalent dosages provided from sources being discussed earlier)<br /><br />could you please explain to satisfy my curiosity what it means to &quot;recalibrate the mg dosage&quot;&nbsp; and why it is false to phrase it saying one is twenty times stronger???&nbsp; to me thats exactly what it means... twenty times the potency for anxiolytic effect or ten times stronger for hypnotic effect<br /><br />(also those are averages and just because you may not have anxiety and the anxiolytic effects may have less impact on you, and that YOU need larger doses comparatively doesnt mean everyone does, so it doesnt mean its wrong to those who do feel that way, like me and the majority or the sources wouldnt list them as equivalent. and the &quot;high&quot; is a completely different matter - may be even less so but that is not what the equivalent doses are measuring)&nbsp;

				These relative numbers come from blind trials mostly. Xanax turned out to be about 20 times more potent then valium in studies on people taking them for anxiety. <br /><br />If you are taking them for some other purpose (hypnotic, muscle relaxant) you could find that the ratio between xanax and valium turns out to be quite a bit&nbsp; lower. Xanax was primarily developed as an anxiolytic, so most properties and relative potencies focus only on that aspect.

Xanax is not 20 times stronger than Valium, period. If you adjust that statement and say, &quot;Xanax is 20 times stronger than Valium &gt;PER MILLIGRAM&lt;&quot;... Then yes, that is an accurate statement.<br /><br />Which is why Valium is normally prescribed in 5mg or 10mg tablets and Xanax is usually prescribed in .5mg or 1mg tablets. Period, end of discussion. .5 X 20 = 10 get it? So one average Xanax pill is equal to one average Valium pill... (In my experience .5mg and 10mg are the two most commonly prescribed doses in the U.S. I&#039;ve been prescribed both.)<br /><br />If you are talking about raw material, thats one thing, but we are talking about pharmaceutical pills here.&nbsp; A&nbsp; standard dose of Valium is essentially equivalent to a standard dose of Xanax.&nbsp; Its not like we are talking about codeine vs. heroin or something. <br /><br />They are different, unique. Xanax does subjectively feel &#039;stronger&#039; or heavier and is shorter acting, but the standard is set by what an average therapeutic dose is. Those would be .5mg:10mg which is equivalent according to any benzo equivalency chart that you will find on the net.

				Depending on your intended use of them - for a comedown: Diazepam - it has a lengthy half life which gives you 24+ hours of anxiolysis cover, bu they stay in your system for well over a day after, meaning you must not drive/drink alcohol for something like two days after<br /><br />for insomnia with or without drugs, and when you need to be functional the next day: Zaleplon (Sonata) - has extremely short half life (5 hours in your body)&nbsp; which allows you to sleep and wake up with no remaining sedation, so you can drive and carry on life the next day. They are also somewhat psychedelic and quite fun by themselves and dont effect sleep architecture. Personally i would chose Zaleplon over any other sedative. 10mg is good for without drugs, whilst 20mg is better when you are taking them. <br /><br />Midazolam, Zolpidem or Alprazolam (Xanax) are good for middle ground, roughly 10hr cover, probably the best choice if you want to sleep and have nothing to do the next day. <br /><br /><br />Also i find with serotonin drugs, adding 8mg Cyproheptadine - a sedating Anti-histamine with strong anti-serotoninergic effects, can bolster a single benzo, reducing your benzo intake and giving you more dreams and a better nights sleep.<br /><br />Anti-psychotics such as prochlorperazine have anti-dopamine effects which can reduce the stimulation from things like amphetamines/meth/MDMA, and come in buccal tabs which go on your gum giving you rapid sedation. <br /><br />hope this helps&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />
