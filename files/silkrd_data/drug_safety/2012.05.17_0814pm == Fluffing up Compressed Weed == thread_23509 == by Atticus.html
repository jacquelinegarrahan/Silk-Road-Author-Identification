				I read somewhere that by putting your weed which has been compressed due to vacuum seal into an air-tight glass gar with an orange peel and leaving it you can fluff the weed up a bit to make it look a bit better and a bit more presentable.<br /><br />- Is this true?<br />- How long should you leave the orange peel in to fluff it up properly?<br />- Is anyone aware of any other techniques to &#039;fluff up&#039; their ganja?<br /><br />Also, general tips for packaging to help weed not be as compressed and making your weed look good thread.<br /><br />Thanks for your help everyone. :)

				I wouldn&#039;t use an orange peel, I&#039;ve seen people do that before but it was usually trying to soften up bricks of regs with it. I&#039;ve had compressed nugs before from being vac sealed for long periods of time and what I did was put them in tupperware with wet (obviously not dripping wet) q-tips taped to the top. The container shouldn&#039;t matter, only reason I used tupperware instead of a jar is because it&#039;s laid out more evenly and I had room to tape several q-tips.<br /><br />You don&#039;t want to overdo it though or it can get moldy.

				heard the best way to fluff it up is boil a pot of water, get a metal strainer put your weed in it then set it on top of the pot and let it steam

				Lol I honestly just smoke the shit. It&#039;s all going to the same place regardless of how &quot;fluffly&quot; it is.<br /><br />I guess i could understand if you&#039;re reselling it though and you want it to be a bit more &quot;presentable&quot; haha.

				I use orange peels all the time, it really works! The trick is you have to use a sealed container, I use a tupperware that seals in pretty good (you can use mason jars if you&#039;re not using a large amount). The trick is not letting the weed touch the orange peels or else they&#039;ll get too moist and just turn into shake. What I do is put a layer of orange peels in my tupperware and then lay a sheet of wax paper on top and then put the bud on top of the wax paper so it won&#039;t be touching the bud. Leave it there for a couple of hours and you should be good, it&#039;ll get moist, fluffy, and get that awesome tangy smell.

				I used orange peels when I sold shit mexican brick weed back in the day and threw it in a bag- seemed to work left in a day or 2- i mean i wasn&#039;t paying attention in those days it was in the infancy of my weed usage.&nbsp; and the dude i used to buy it from just said to do it. So i cant be certain present day penny would have approved the nugs, but who knows
