				I bought 5 tabs of LSD in June thinking I was going to take it as soon as it arrived, however due to other circumstances I haven&#039;t been able to take any. I&#039;ve kept it in the vaccum pack, which in turn is inside a load of folded A4 paper. Most of the time it&#039;s been in a dark and fairly cool place (apart from one time when it was in a bag in the back of a hot car for a few hours). I was just wondering whether any of the LSD could&#039;ve either rubbed off the blotter, or might&#039;ve been damaged in some other way?? I&#039;m hoping to take it with a few friends this month who have never done it, and it&#039;d be a bit of a bummer for the other guys if it didn&#039;t really give any effect on their first time.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />B

				I keep mine foil sealed wrapped inside a plastic bag inside a mason jar in the refrigerator. <br />Light, air, and heat are the main degradation factors.<br />Depending on how well you have kept those away from the blotter would give you your answer.<br />I&#039;d say you are more than likely fine - June wasn&#039;t that long ago.<br /><br />Enjoy your trip.<br />Vanquish

				Do not worry about it, I had some lsd blotters from fartbomber inside a holy bible for about 4 months in a air free ambiento and the blotters are in perfect condition, I trip balls last week with one blotter.<br /><br />Enjoy your trips, and be safe.<br /><br />Cheers

				I usually dont like organic materials like paper to touch it. An amber vial is an excellent way to store it,somewhere dark and cool also.

				Sounds like you protected it from heat and light. The paper will have thermally insulated it reducing temperature fluxuations.<br /><br />The way you were storing the LSD it should last for decades.<br /><br />Pro-tip: Lick the plastic it was sealed in.

				Relax dude, its not as sensitive as you think.<br /><br />Some vendors even seal tabs off with a special chemical to prolong LSD potency I think.<br /><br />I have 7 tabs from at least 1 month in my room, at warm temperature and semi-light exposure. I have yet to notice a difference in potency.
