				There is alot of discussion on the open web about Ketamine bladder syndrome or Ketamine Cystitis. I was wondering if anyone had had any experience or knowledge on this <br /><br />A few links (Open net )<br />&nbsp;http://www.nursingtimes.net/Journals/2012/03/30/i/f/m/110621PRevKetamine.pdf <br />http://www.ketaminebladdersyndrome.com/KBS/Welcome.html<br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/618961-Ketamine-cystitis-pain!

				The PDF was extremely interesting.&nbsp; The second two links not so much.<br /><br />I have heard people allude to this before but never any official explanation.<br /><br />As someone who has taken ketamine early on his life quite a bit, I never experienced any of the symptoms described other than while being on K.&nbsp; When I am stuck I definitely have trouble urinating and many of the other symptoms described.&nbsp; That sounds brutal to live with when sober.<br /><br />Crazy people who can&#039;t stop after having surgery to fix it - I don&#039;t get it.

				It seems to be caused by the gall bladder spasms. It is one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. I&#039;m surprised I never called an ambulance, it was only the fact that I knew it was the K.<br /><br />It came after about 2 years of non stop K use between 2-5 gs a day usually. After a while you just get caught in the world of K and you start having audible hallucinations during the day and schizophrenic like breaks. Not very fun at all especially when you gotta try and work around this.<br /><br />A lot of people will disagree and say that it doesn&#039;t happen or wont happen if you don&#039;t swallow the drip or if you cook the K. All of it is bullshit. Seem to be the metabolite nor-ketamine that does the damage. At one point I though my bladder was done for and I thought K was going to kill me. 2-3 years later I&#039;m pretty much normal but I still have a huge tolerance to K and most other drugs for some reason, and my bladder (thank fuck) feel almost normal.<br /><br />Heavy K users beware. It hasn&#039;t got the nickname psychedelic heroin for no reason

				I had a Kidney Stone at a fairly young age and I&#039;d be willing to bet my past Ketamine use didn&#039;t help anything.

				Ketamine is a drug that can creep up on you in regards to chronic use.&nbsp; I realized I was using it every day using the anti-depressant effect as an excuse.&nbsp; They were ligght doses but one night shortly after that I injected 100mg.&nbsp; Everything around me became foreign (despite the fact should have all been familiar to me).&nbsp; I could hear a decently loud noise that I knew wasn&#039;t there.&nbsp; Freaked me out.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t use ketamine for a month after that.<br /><br />Even though I don&#039;t use these massive doses of ketamine I do worry about doing damage, especially when I feel a numb pain in or around my bladder around the time I use ketamine.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to become a chronic drug user anyway.&nbsp; This just gives me an excuse to take weeks off at a time.&nbsp; Besides, ketamine tolerance is a bitch.
