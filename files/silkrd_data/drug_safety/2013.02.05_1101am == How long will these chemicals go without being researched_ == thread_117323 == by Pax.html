				or How long do&nbsp; chemicals typically go without being researched.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(4-AcO-DET) -&nbsp; 4-Acetoxy-DET (4-Acetoxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine), also known as ethacetin, ethylacybin or 4-AcO-DET is a psychedelic tryptamine. It was first synthesized in 1958 by Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz lab.[1]<br />It is expected that the compound is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-DET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a little more info but still considered a research chemical also no health profile&nbsp; (4-AcO-DMT)- O-Acetylpsilocin (psilacetin) and several other esters of psilocin were patented on January 16, 1963 by Sandoz Ltd. via Albert Hofmann &amp; Franz Troxler (US Patent # 3,075,992).[1] Despite this fact, psilacetin remains a psychedelic with a limited history of use. It is theorized to be a prodrug for psilocin, as is psilocybin, which is naturally occurring in various mushrooms. Psilacetin is O-acetylated psilocin, whereas psilocybin is O-phosphorylated. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(4-AcO-MiPT), or 4-acetoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine is a hallucinogenic tryptamine. It is closely related to O-acetylpsilocin and MiPT.<br />There is very little information on the human pharmacology or toxicity of 4-AcO-MiPT.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for fuck sake must I go on the whole (2C family),(Nbome family),(DOx),(DOI),The whole (TMA family)<br />there us very little if ANY health profile on an of these drugs some of them for 50 years.That really scares me away from trying some of these drugs cause I might not know what the have done to me within my lifetime any help?

				till some big pharma company decides to sell it as medication. otherwise there is no reason to test these. <br /><br />but you can do something if you want to. just buy a lot of rats and start giving them measured out doses.&nbsp; you can find&nbsp; the ld50 this way and side effects like hairloss, blindness and obvious things like that...

				This is just how the system works,&nbsp; however.<br /><br />The research and clinical trials to bring a drug to the market are easily in the order of a billion dollars. Doing so can yield about 10 years of patent protected sales, after which others can produce generics and the value of&nbsp; the medication drops to zero.<br /><br />When it comes to profiting from patents prior art becomes a problem too. For example it would be impossible to patent caffeine, despite it may be very effective in increasing alertness for drivers. Without that patent protection there simply is no money to be made, not even for clinical trials. This basically is why you can get a cup of&nbsp; coffee from any gas station, but you&#039;d have a hard time finding a caffeine tablet that is cheaper than a cup of coffee.

				You could start your own pharma company and research it further - there is no legal barrier to do so.<br /><br />There is, however, the matter of financing things. To get a drug from research to market costs at leat a billion in clinical trials and legal proceedings. I presume you do not have that kind of money in the bank, so you would need to source it elsewhere. Nowadays, crowdfunding could&nbsp; be an option.
