				Ok I was given a few of these tabs by a dealer and knew from the look of them that they where a really poor knock off of Xanax so I trow them away.<br /><br />Several people in my area have died from from tainted Xanax in the past few days, I just want to know if it is from this Oanax or other knock off so I can help get the word out and hopefully save a person or two.<br /><br />Does anyone have more info on them?

				From my experience a good amount of onax bars are legit.&nbsp; There are a few pictures on google that compare real onax to a real fake one.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty damn noticeable in terms of how badly it was made.&nbsp; Bad ONAX imprints and it just looks like a total mess.<br /><br />Granted, all Onax and knock off xanax bars(or any roche valiums, klonopins, with the original brand packages are knock offs that&nbsp; come from the Middle east, India, and SE Asia.&nbsp; So in terms of quality, they&#039;re never on par with EU or US made.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong I believe SUN Pharma still does really produce ONAX bars I believe but they are still no match for the shit sold in real pharmacies in the US and EU.&nbsp; &nbsp; Most knock offs do however definitely contain the active ingredients just either horribly under dosed or real poor quality control. <br /><br />Seller Bionik sells the real Onax bars.&nbsp; But they are definitely somewhat weaker than the real deal shit from phramacies.&nbsp; In my high benzo use days I killed about 100 Onax bars in a bout week from the my order of Bionik.&nbsp; If it was a real pharmacy shit I probably could&#039;ve only killed like half.&nbsp; But of course I was real bad benzo addict then.&nbsp; <br /><br />CLEARNET LINK:<br />http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=nvpl4m&amp;s=7#.UjTfND-8r5I<br /><br />The fake is on the left and the real deal on the right.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong the real deal ones are definitely good but it hits slower and not as potent as the real deal.

				Quite a lot of xanax knockoffs are as good as or sometimes even better than the real thing. Its a real hit &amp; miss game though, but they&#039;re generally much better value for money also.<br /><br />I had a few onax bars the other week and they were great stuff

				Onax bars are usually good quality in my experience.&nbsp; They do have quality control, the only thins is they are faked more commonly then &quot;Xanax&quot; bars.<br /><br />The only way to really tell is try them, or test them.&nbsp; Onax bars are pretty cheap from IOPs.

				Goddam i just reread the OP, shit sorry to hear that pal, a similar thign happened over here a few years back with a batch of tainted diazepam which killed off a few, some people are just sadistic :(..<br /><br />Sorry but i&#039;m not sure, things like this are usually a small isolated batch, its not exactly good marketing for anything bar heroin &#039;drugs so good they&#039;ll kill you&#039;, i presume you&#039;ve already tried googling? Would probably be more help.<br /><br />Stay safe and advice people off illict benzos altogether for the next few weeks if possible<br />CLK
