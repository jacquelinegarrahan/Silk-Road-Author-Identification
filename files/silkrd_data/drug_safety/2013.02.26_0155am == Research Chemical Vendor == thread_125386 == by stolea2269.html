				Hey all,<br /><br />Looking for a new, legal RC vendor. Been away from the scene for a couple months for personal reasons and the guys I used to use are no longer around. Anyone wanting to PM me someone good will get much love &lt;3<br /><br />S

				I suppose it depends on what RC you are interested in.&nbsp; Honestly, at this point, why would you care if they&#039;re legal?&nbsp; I mean it would be nice to be able to not go to jail if you&#039;re caught; but honestly, if you&#039;re caught with a powder in a baggie, you&#039;re going to jail.&nbsp; AFTER they run a GC/MS test you&#039;ll probably be let out providing you can prove that it&#039;s not intended for consumption, but even &#039;LEGAL&#039; RC&#039;s are still illegal when intended for consumption.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can bet your ass they&#039;re gonna try and prove they&#039;re intended for consumption and you better have a pretty good amount of evidence to prove otherwise.&nbsp; The burden of proof is on them, but they can state that it&#039;s for consumption and if you call BS [say that&#039;s not true] the burden of proof just switched to you and in front of a jury of your &#039;peers&#039;(that wouldn&#039;t know the difference between an amine and methyl group) you won&#039;t have the chance of an ice cube in hell.<br /><br />Besides, why would you want to consume even LESS researched drugs where the long term(let alone short term) side effects are unknown?

				Ah, thanks for the reply mate. I suppose throwing &quot;legal&quot; in there was a mistake on my part - I think I was overgeneralizing anything not on the deep web as &quot;legal&quot;, should&#039;ve just said clearweb RC vendors. I don&#039;t care too much about the legality of the stuff - I suppose it&#039;s a nice fall back but, like you said, never something I would rely on. <br /><br />More specifically I&#039;m looking for a good vendor for 4-AcO-DMT and a couple other 4- and 5-sub tryptamines. The psilacetin market on the road is less than ideal right now.
