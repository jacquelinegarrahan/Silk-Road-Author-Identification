				Which drug would you be able to take without exhibiting any side effects, both physical such as runny nose, speech impediment, a twitch, excessive sleepiness, mood swings, or any other side-effects that would give it away?

				I feel like any drug to be honest, if you&#039;re a strong willed person and take a moderate dose you should be able to suppress any type of side effects except dilated pupils and things like that.

				Well...it&#039;s all about the dose.&nbsp; If you take too much of any drug, it&#039;ll have a tell.&nbsp; If you take a small enough amount of any drug, you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; So really, what you are looking for is large affects with a small amount of tell.&nbsp; I&#039;d say the best in this category would be psychedelics and opiates.&nbsp; Psychedelics require you to be able to handle yourself though, or else it&#039;ll be fairly obvious.&nbsp; Low / moderate dose benzos, stimulants are also possible if you know how to handle yourself.&nbsp;

				Yeah, it&#039;s all in the dose. I can shoot some dope or meth and go to work without any problem as long as I don&#039;t over do it. Mixing can help too. Take a benzo to take the edge off of stimulants or do a little stimulant to wake you up if your nodding from opiates. I can act pretty normal on a few drinks or hits of weed. Just use some Visine so your eyes aren&#039;t red, and brush your teeth or chew some gum to get the smell off your breath.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I could work tripping hard though. I ate a few shrooms once and it was difficult to focus and get through the shift.

				Aside from dilated pupils, MDMA. I&#039;ve done it at work a couple of times, and no one was the wiser.

				Don&#039;t go to work stoned. I&#039;ve lost 3 jobs because of this... when will I learn... :)<br /><br />Benzo&#039;s and a couple whiskey shots tend to go over quite well...<br /><br />Like people have stated before it&#039;s all about moderation baby!

				I have went to work plenty of times on Meth and nobody has said a thing, but a few I think I went too high and people noticed something was different, but since I did such a good job probably just thought I wasn&#039;t feeling a good, but in lower doses it makes me seem normal, as I am usually very introspective and to my self.<br /><br />I try not to do this, but when I get a sample for free from a vendor and it is a work day I have to write the report on their product don&#039;t I?<br /><br />I think LSD on low to medium doses is easy to interact and seem fine. I have only done it once and took two hits and took a walk and a cop stopped me (small town and if I am seen outside or pretty much anywhere I get harassed because I use to sell a bunch, but they seem to forget I don&#039;t anymore) I wasn&#039;t even scared or anxious and made small talk while he searched me and ran my name, because apparently that is what they do if your out after dark now from what he said lol I felt totally at ease and knew nothing bad was going to happen and it made me laugh and feel good know I am on acid and he is harassing me, but doesn&#039;t know I am on acid. I was the yin to his yang I felt like.

				That is why I suggested low to medium dose and higher quality crystal like silver or fluff.

You have to find the perfect dose for you. That way you get some stimulation without the pupil dilation. Also, 4fa stimulation last longer than the euphoria. So remember that before you think about re dosing because you&#039;ll think you&#039;re back at baseline when you&#039;re not.
