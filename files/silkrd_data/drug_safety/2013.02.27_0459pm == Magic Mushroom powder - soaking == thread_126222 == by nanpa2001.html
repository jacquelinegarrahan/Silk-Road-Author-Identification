				I heard that it is best to soak magic mushroom powder in a juice containing citric acid, but for how long?<br /><br />Anyone know?

				I&#039;d also like to know the answer to this. I&#039;ll be buy some shrooms for the summer and i&#039;ve thought about powdered and putting into capsules.

				You mean lemon tek?<br />20-30 minutes will be enough. That&#039;s what most people do anyway.<br />It is supposed to strengthen and shorten the trip, so use less than you would normally do. <br />For more info you can search here http://www.shroomery.org/forums/

				what is the point of this? you turn something to hcl? or is there a more complex reaction? <br />if you use lemon juice&nbsp; i think the additional chemicals and vitamins&nbsp; in it will also boost your trip.

It is supposed to turn psilocybin into psilocin which happens naturally when ps. mushrooms are digested. <br />That speeds up the process making the trip&#039;s beginning/ending come faster and the peak stronger.<br />

				Awesome information...&nbsp; Is this more like the trip you get from fresh shrooms?&nbsp; the trips are more magical and a bit stronger on fresh shrooms than dried.&nbsp;

Dried shrooms only contain the psilocybin, so changing that into psilocin should make the trip feel more like the ones on fresh shrooms. I say go for it! <br /><br />

				It is indeed exaggeration to say 4-5x&nbsp; GoodShitExplorer. I ve done 2g lemon tek and it was definitely not 8-10 gr of normal shrooms. Maybe somewhere 3-3,5gr would be more realistic.<br />There are hundreds of threads on this method on shroomery, with varying opinions, some said it was much stronger some said it didn&#039;t affect at all, most of what I ve read believe it&#039;s somewhere between 1,5-2x.

				Well we all judge from our personal experience and since there&#039;s no scientific data on that I cant tell you re wrong. If so you are really lucky, you can save a lot of money that way :D

				this has been one of the most helpful threads ever. its not surrounded in BS or fluff (until now?). straight down to the helpful stuff. will be trying this sunday! thank you so much everyone especially OP. take my karma!<br /><br />UPDATE: didn&#039;t have much success with this besides covering the disgusting shroom taste. it seemed on par with potency unless foxcave doesn&#039;t have good shrooms but everybody says he does. THEN AGAIN I used lemon and lime juice from those little bottles instead of fresh fruit...so that could have been it. damn. i&#039;ll try the actual fruit next time and hopefully that will be better. oh well.

				Assuming your shrooms were dried correctly and are potent still (some ppl STILL use too much heat when drying and murder the potency) then just use warm water, lemon juice and powdered shrooms. Let sit for 30 mins. Strain and enjoy. Don&#039;t boil or microwave or use boiling water. Bathtub temp is more than enough. I use a cup of water per 7g and about 1/4 of those little lemon squeeze bottles (or a whole lemons juice).<br /><br />It definitely makes it more visual and slightly more potent, not twice or anything but the still the only way to go. It kicks in quickly and makes coming up fast and not nearly as unpleasant as eating them will.
