				Hey,<br /><br />A year ago I got hold of some excellent blotters containing 250ug of LSD (Buddhas). I never candy-flipped before and never tended to but I&#039;m at a small party coming up on half a blotter of LSD and my mate comes around asking me if I want half a pill of decent E, of course I do! The rest of the night is like an average trip, except more sedated kinda cause of the MDMA, and most people are partying while I&#039;m on my stomach looking at the extremely HD dust and dog hairs in my friends carpet and the breathing aura around the apartments only potted flower. <br /><br />Later I go home alone being slightly paranoid of meeting random people or cops on the way home. Of course a big Russian guy is blocking the entrance to my apartment building as well as being speedy as fuck and extremely talkative. I&#039;m sort of panicking and get a bad feeling the Russian is going to eat me up with his big mouth or that he is going to catch some coppers attention (I&#039;m lucky living 2 blocks away from the station). Finally I get past him and I&#039;m in my bed with my head down my pillow. As the sun is coming up the light reflects on my pillow and it looks and feel like I&#039;m free falling through the sky.<br /><br />Unfortunately before I fall asleep I get a text from a friend wondering where the fuck I am as we are having a stag party down at the park for another friend who is getting married. I just feel kinda tired but not high anymore or that dizzy, although it is present, on my way to the park. 6 hours about 8 beers and a joint later my friend who is getting married get hit by a car after attempting to chase down some skirt on the other side of the street. My friends arm is broken and he goes to the hospital which I do not feel particularly bad about as I&#039;m now extremely tired and dizzy.<br /><br />Next morning I wake up I can&#039;t walk straight, if I turn my head the earth is spinning and I feel like vomiting all the time. This lasted for 2 weeks and was horrible. Do you guys think it is cause of the candy flipping or more likely a combination of that and sleep deprivation combined with drinking? I&#039;m a bit afraid of doing LSD again especially now as I need to focus a lot in uni. What do you guys think? :)<br />

				2 weeks of dizziness and feeling like vomiting and you didn&#039;t see a doctor? Man I would get a checkup or blood tests or something. Maybe you had something like a&nbsp; minor seizure or stroke. Or at very least an inner ear infection ( or imbalance?). Don&#039;t mean to freak you out or anything. Anything that lasts that amount of time can&#039;t be good. My advice would be to make sure your health is good before doing&nbsp; any more drugs. Good luck.

				Hey thanks for reply.<br /><br />I did see my friend who is a doctor, he took my blood pressure and checked my pupils and everything was fine. I did no tell him about the drugs but he told me he suspect I probably got dizzy from stress and it is quite common. Then he gave me some motion sickness pills that did not help too much.

				Yeah dizziness is common, but not for 2 whole weeks! I think you should have come clean to the doctor, but hey if you worried about exposing your drug use, I can see that as an excuse. I mean after like the 3rd or 4th day of your described symptoms, I would have been at a emergency room or clinic to get help. But if you are feeling fine now, that&#039;s a good sign I guess. Try to see a doctor that isn&#039;t your friend maybe?

				I think that 8 beers alone can cause a nasty hangover.<br /><br />MDMA and LSD are not to be mixed with alcohol. Alcohol ruins everything.<br /><br />I felt excellent after candyflipping. For at least 2 weeks. ;D ;D<br /><br />Also, your friend was getting married and was chasing other girls? The force is strong in him.

However I found heaps of article (e.g. http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=92374) involving dizziness for periods of time (2 days to 2+ weeks) after taking high MDMA. But none that I found explains why.
