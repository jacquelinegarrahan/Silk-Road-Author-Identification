				Hey guys, so I could use some clarification on the MDMA doses in the two forms of product. It doesn&#039;t really seem to make sense right now.<br /><br />As I understand it, when someone says that a pill of E is 150mg (for example, AH&#039;s 150mg blue rolex) what he means is that it contains 150mg of PURE, 100% MDMA, in addition to the binding agents necessary to keep it together. So I suppose that this would mean that the 150mg pill of E contains 178.57mg of that 84% crystal, in addition to the binding agents that keep it in pill form. If I was misinformed about this, then the trend I&#039;m about to explain below is a bit weaker, so please let me know. <br /><br />Now, when you buy 1g of MDMA crystal, what you have is a product that is 84% MDMA, so in essence you are getting 840mg of PURE, 100% MDMA.<br /><br />If I am understanding this correctly, then why are the prices of pills so consistently lower? This has been true with both ST and AH. For example: If you decide to buy 250 of AH&#039;s blue rolexes for 67B, or ~$710, then you are paying roughly $2.84 each for a pill containing 150mg of pure, 100% MDMA.<br /><br />Now say you buy a similar value (but somewhat more!) of MDMA crystal&nbsp; and buy 50g of MDMA crystal from AH at 90.29B, or $951.65. Given the 84% purity, what you&#039;re getting for your money is 42g (42000mg) of comparable 100% purity MDMA. Divide that by 150 and you get 280; you have the equivalent of 280 blue rolexes. However, at a price of $951.65, you end up paying $3.4 for each of these!<br /><br />With each approach, you get 150mg of 100% MDMA, but with the pills you spend LESS and get them for $2.84 each. With the MDMA crystal, you have to buy MORE and you get each equivalent molly at $3.4 each! You&#039;d have to buy in MUCH higher quantities of MDMA for it to be a better deal than for the pills. This trend seem to have held true for all the vendors I&#039;ve looked at. <br /><br />Am I not correctly understanding the 84% crystal/100% pill distinction? Because if I am, then these findings make no sense. Why would dealers sell the pills for less than the crystal? Especially considering the additional time and expense necessary to process the crystal into pill form. Can anyone clarify this for me?

				Dont know who you are buying your pills from but most pills are more expensive that MDMA crystal. Most vendors exxagerate the MG dose of there pills btw, just because the first batch contained 180mg about 6 months ago there is no chance it still contains that amount, more likely around the 130/140 range. Pill producers are known for knocking out high dosed pills and then just lowering the content slowly.<br /><br />You are right, in rock form it is 84% pure, because it can only be that pure as a solid, so 840mg mdma in your 1000mg of &quot;mdma rocks&quot;,

				I&#039;m talking specifically about SuperTrips and AfterHour and their pills. These dealers (as well as Chiquita and his blue defqons) have been selling for a long time, to MANY customers and have a reputation for selling the same high quality product every time. Many customers have taken the liberty of lab testing these pills and found that they are as strong as advertised.<br /><br />So if we disregard the possibility that they&#039;re being dishonest and lying about the strength of their pills (which you can be reasonably assured of when you buy from the biggest dealers), then their pills do seem to be as cheaper or cheaper than their MDMA crystal, at least until you buy in very large quantities. Can anyone explain this?

				generally you wont find freebase... its the salt molecule which is why you are referencing 84 % by molecular weight<br /><br />so when they are measuring out the mdma for the pills, they too are weighing the salt, so thats in general the same 84 percent of that listed amount

				So if I were to send a pill to a lab to be tested, and their report told me that it contained 100mg of MDMA, that would mean that that it is identical to MDMA crystal weighing 100mg?<br /><br />If that&#039;s true, then that would mean that in the example I listed above (buying $910 worth of crystal) would actually end up costing $2.85 per 150mg. Slightly more expensive than the pills, but insignificantly so. Still, you have to buy 30% more to reach this tipping point, and that&#039;s quite strange when you consider that the supplier has to pay to process the pills.<br /><br />I guess dealers plan the scaling down of their prices for buying in bulk around sales at the higher volumes. After 50g it definitely becomes cheaper to buy MDMA.

				Some misinformation here.&nbsp; If a pill claims to have 150mg mdma, it is identical to 150mg of crystal, assuming the crystal is pure mdma.hcl. What do you think goes in the pill?<br />The <br />84% purity BS is spawned by chromatography. When analyzed pure mdma.hcl is 84% mdma and 16% hcl. Aka pure.

				i agree its kinda BS saying its only 84 percent pure or whatever<br /><br />that figure actually matters when comparing equivalent doses of a salt to the freebase, or equivalent doses of one salt to the other - as when trying to figure out equivalent doses of mescaline hydrochloride vs mescaline acetate <br /><br />its not to say your molly is only 84 percent purity... if pure its 100 percent mdma hcl
