				I wondered if there are people on the forum who lost loved ones on substance abuse. Statistically there must be.<br /><br />I thought it might be interesting to share these story&#039;s. How it came that the person went downhill, which substances were involved, what kind of person it was (healthy, happy, or unhappy, good career or not etc) what you personally learned from it etcetera... <br /><br />Anybody wants to kick off?<br />

				i&#039;ve had a few of my friends check out early, mostly their own fault though.. considering all the stupid shit i&#039;ve done, i&#039;m surprised i&#039;m still alive.<br /><br />one guy left a nitrous mask on and had a clamp on the hose that he had to press to stop the flow.. why the hell he did it that way i&#039;ll never know (i would think you&#039;d have it so where you press to open it and when you let go the hose is cut off)<br /><br />another took a heroic dose of lsd and walked out into a busy highway<br /><br />story that made the news, buddy got off probation, went out that night and ate a few tabs. caused some problems at a club, cops show up and tazed him about 4 or 5 dozen times and he died in the hospital a couple days later.<br /><br />another guy ended up doing too many benzos after a coke binge and choked himself in his sleep.

				I&#039;ve had 2 friends die, one from heroin OD, the other from a pulmonary embolism caused by meth. And myself, I&#039;ve almost died twice. Can&#039;t get too specific with the details, but after a couple years clean I&#039;m back again, but trying not to slip back into active addiction. Sometimes you won&#039;t know when you&#039;ve crossed the line, but you can see it coming, and that should be the point in which you put on the brakes for a bit. Totally possible to do all manner of drugs safely and responsibly; its just that for some of us, its more difficult than for others.
