				Althought stilumants haven&#039;t been kind to me in the past due to bad comedowns.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to give it another shot with lowered doses.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got two options.&nbsp; Methamphetamine and dextroahmphetamine.<br /><br />For those who have tired both... which one of the have least harsh comedown?

				Hands down, dextro has less of a comedown.&nbsp; But, of course, with great highs comes great lows.&nbsp; That said, if you stay up for a couple of days you&#039;re going to feel like shit, so use sparingly.

				Recovered meth user here, I can tell you first hand, at first it&#039;s not a bad comedown, but if you keep it up, it will feel like your body is shutting down. If your gonna go days on end, remember to eat good food. Fresh fruit and juice. It helps to &quot;try&quot; and maintain a normal nutrition regiment even though you wont be hungry. Weed helps a lot as well. When I decided to end the party and come down, I went to bed and rode it out there for a day. It was fun, but it&#039;s easy to enjoy it too much.

				If I take a small bump of meth in the morning, would I be able to fall asleep in the evening?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to be up for 3 days zonked out of my mind.<br /><br />I want to use it as a productive tool, not a recreational one.

				Yes, if you do a bump in the morning you will be able to sleep.&nbsp; When I first started I would use it for school.&nbsp; I would start with a line in the morning after I&#039;ve had something to eat.&nbsp; Then, depending on what I had to do, I would re-bump after lunch.&nbsp; I said to myself &quot;No lines after 5PM&quot; and it worked for six months.&nbsp; But, next thing you know I had to cram for exams and ended up staying up for days in the library.&nbsp; I ended up with good grades and about 30 pounds skinnier after two years.

				Prices on SR are considerably higher for both meth and dextro.&nbsp; On the streets it&#039;s cheaper and I&#039;ve found the ice on SR to be hit or miss on quality.&nbsp; If you live in the U.S. I would suggest getting a prescription for adderall.&nbsp; You can google the questions the doctors ask and they usually have no problem prescribing it.&nbsp; But, I agree with Bob, it&#039;s safer to just take vyvanse in the morning.&nbsp; It seems you just want to try meth though.

Vyvanse is not addictive. It may be habit forming for some, but its not addictive.&nbsp; I think if you have absolutely no interest in euphoria, and are simply looking for a productivity tool, it makes absolutely no sense to chose Meth over Dextro. Vyvanse son. If you want to be productive AND feel really euphoric while you are doing your tasks, than I guess Meth would make more sense.

				Are we talking crank or glass here? The comedown is relative to the quality of the product...<br /><br />Anyways...out of all my experiences with meth...the comedown is fairly harsh...being up for so long that you&#039;re physically tired but you can&#039;t sleep...and finally you just pass out from utter exhaustion...<br /><br />With Adderall it just kinda wears off and it feels like you just had a long day at the office...

				I take Vyvanse 50mg and there is literally no come down to speak of, and I am highly sensitive to adverse physical effects of drugs like that. If you do feel a little on edge drink a couple beers, but its no big deal. The only way you have a bad comedown is if you take way too much and/or keep redosing and stay up a few nights in a row and all that bullshit. In other words, if you don&#039;t abuse them there is no come down and no addiction, and its pretty easy to not abuse them, especially if you arn&#039;t in college.

				it hurts to come off meth, and the mindfuck is brutal, but prescription amphetamines dont wrack your body and torture your bones like meth, it doesnt matter if its shards or anhydrous it all hurts to come off of, thats why folks keep doin it, to avoid that suicidal comedown.&nbsp; &nbsp;if youre a pro you can eat, do a small bump in the morning, burn all day, then eat and maybe smoke if ur a toker, that evening, and fall asleep all nite,&nbsp; get up and do it again tha next day.&nbsp; but if u go on a bender and do a plungerbender rather than a small bump, ur gonna hafta pay the price. no good deed goes unpunished. :P

				A lot of factors play into wether or not you&#039;re going to come down or crash. Eating and drinking plenty of fluids is a must. When you go through the stages of starvation, dehydration, and sleep deprivation it can feel really shitty. I&#039;ve found personally the comedowns and even the crashes of meth or more physical than mental. I mean yeah you are thinkin about doing more meth lol, but i don&#039;t get nearly as suicidial as i have from MDMA.
