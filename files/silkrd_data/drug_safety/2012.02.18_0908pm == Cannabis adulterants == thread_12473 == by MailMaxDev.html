				First off, what makes you suspect that it&#039;s been cut? I personally haven&#039;t heard of anyone cutting weed with anything except for that whole glass dust thing a while back. Unless someone is trying to kill you and sprayed the weed with poison or some shit, worst case scenario is that they just tossed in some oregano or something. More details + potentially a hi res picture may help.

				A day after smoking this stuff I feel slower and I have a constant headache. When I smoked it there was kind of a weird taste and I think my tongue was a little numb as well. I didn&#039;t seem to get the munchies either. I gave the remaining bud to a friend that thinks I&#039;m just being paranoid but I&#039;m not totally sure.

				In my area it&#039;s not uncommon for dealers to spray their weed with Windex, bug spray, inhalants etc. so they can sell low quality weed and still get people who don&#039;t know better fucked up. I&#039;m trying to figure out if the weed my dealer&#039;s getting has been fucked with but I can&#039;t find a surefire way to do that. Is there anywhere I could send it to be tested perhaps? I live in Canada.

				Thats fucked up... I have never heard of such things. <br /><br />You should be able to distinguish smoking an adulterant from smoking an active cannabinoid. Id think youd be sick as shit if you smoke any of that stuff or you bud should smell like shit at least... If anything I think it could be sprayed with a synthetic cannabinoid to make it seem more potent, which may be difficult to tell the difference but is still not the same experience as weed. Not all strains produce the same effects all the time, including hunger, but it does sound like you got nice and high... and paranoid :P<br /><br />Testing for adulterants, especially if you dont know what you are looking for isnt going to be easy. I guess you could have them HPLC or mass spec the sample, and see if you got a hit to anything in a database but tests like that arent cheap. Thinking about it though, there are plenty of labs nowadays if you live in a place where it is legal to posses, to send your bud to be tested. They not only measure cannabinoid content but also check for pesticides, molds, and other dangers potentially including adulterants if you specified concern. <br /><br />imo you should just be buying better weed! If your weed doesnt look and smell dank, why even waste the money? There should be absolutely no question when you have some beautiful nugs of good bud.<br />&nbsp;<br />- miRNA

				Just throwing this out there, you cannot &quot;cut&quot; marijuana.&nbsp; Unless of course, you are buying preground buds (which is mindless anyways).&nbsp; You buy the buds, and nugs off of the larger buds.&nbsp; &nbsp;What you had was most likely an outdoor grow that was sprayed with anti-pest chemicals or poisons by law enforcement (if you live in an area that receives southwestern US grown, naturally occurring, marijuana).&nbsp; I would have just thrown the bud out as it is no good and won&#039;t do much for your health.&nbsp; If neither of these is true, you simply got a synthetic, which is as good as garbage.&nbsp; The whole JWH-0XX family is just a trash heap of a drug, I would recommend finding a new dealer or seller.<br /><br />But as to telling if the buds are &quot;laced&quot;, the smell of the pot is the first indicator, if it has a very clean (chemical) odor, it is most likely grown and cured by a moron.&nbsp; The appearance can also be an indicator, if the bud/shake is red or has redish hues to it (not the thichromatic hairs) it has been sprayed with certain forms of crop killing poisons, which you should obviously steer away from. <br />

				The amount that gets you high doesn&#039;t seem consistent with its appearance (mids) and the high seems to get uncomfortable, I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s sprayed with a JWH-xxx. I think I&#039;m just going to stick to weed from Silk Road from now on.
