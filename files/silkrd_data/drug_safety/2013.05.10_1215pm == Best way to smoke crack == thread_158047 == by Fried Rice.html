				Just wondering what ways people prefer to smoke crack or ways which get the most value or best hit.<br />Me and a mate cooked up some crack the other week, this is probably one drug I have not had huge contact with, we did the usual glass tube with brillo, we made a small bong with a cone packed with brillo, tried smoking it in a pipe like meth (this tasted pretty bad), just to see which we got the best hit and the most value from.<br />I have to say I feel like I am missing a bit of skill when smoking it and sometimes didn&#039;t get as big of a hit as I could have. My drug of choice is meth I have smoked it forever and enjoy how well I can it to smoke up, and cringe when I see people cooking the fuck out of it.<br />I received some crack from TheCompany I really don&#039;t think its crack, it is very powdery not hard at all and has an odd chemical taste, its a little trippy when you smoke it, gives a little numbing in the mouth, its odd.<br />Any tips on how to get a good puff would be good to hear

				<br />IMO the best way is as you said with a Brillo and Glass tube, but that takes abit of time to get &#039;just&#039; right its always to tight or to loose , but when you get it sussed it&#039;s the best way. The most economical is to chase it on foil, I like to mix a Rock with No3 heroin and smoke together on foil, after a few pipes it kind of levels me off and stops the Crack want.<br />C .<br />

				I have never smoked crack, but i would often rock some up to check out purity before dropn my cash on a big order of coke. I can assure you though, that it should never be soft or powdery. Every time I whipped up a rock, it was hard as all shit, and never &#039;powdery&#039;. <br /><br />Id say your best bet is to get some blow, and rock it your self, its very easy. There is a thread or two in here some where going over it step by step.

				Yeah me and a friend cooked some the other week and like you said it was like rocks. I don&#039;t know what this shit is from TheCompany but it aint crack, it has a really strong smell like chlorine and does not fire up like the stuff I cooked. I will have to be desperate to smoke this it tastes like shit and I never waste drugs. Waste of money do not buy

				As far as I know the best way would be to coke it with ammonia. Then coke it again with water to get the ammonia out. Then take a metal weed pipe. Make sure it is air tight. So you dont suck in false air. Then get some pipe screen<br />burn them to get the possible hazards stuff out. Put 5 of them in the head of the pipe. Some ash then place the base on it move the flame around above it to melt it in to the ass. Then before smoking take a few deep breath then exhale. Then suck slow then fast. <br /><br />PS. <br />A rasta how teached me to smoke. Told me that you should have an intention before you smoke.<br />That you smoke for something.<br />He told me first smoke for TO SEE, then TO KNOW then TO UNDERSTAND.<br /><br />That is how its done here in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Please tell me how it worked out.<br /><br />I wish you all the best and in the next life true succes
