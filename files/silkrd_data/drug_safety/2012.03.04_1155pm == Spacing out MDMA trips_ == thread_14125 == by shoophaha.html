				Hello everyone! I&#039;m new here to SR and am hoping to purchase some MDMA for myself and some friends within the next month or two. I have a question about how frequently one should do it.<br /><br />We&#039;ve been planning for a while to do it for Easter (April 7th) as there&#039;s a big school concert that weekend. However, we also thought it would be fun to do it this next weekend (March 16th) too as we have friends visiting. I have done molly twice, once last November (that was amazing!) and once in early February (nothing really happened then), and I know that with psychedelics you&#039;re supposed to space your trips out. Does molly work the same way? Would you recommend that we just wait to do it in April, especially as we already did it in February?<br /><br />I am pretty familiar with drugs (smoke weed very often and have done shrooms and acid) but the other members of my party are not as experiencedâ€”they have only smoked weed a few times and did molly with me in February. Please advise. Thank you!

				If you wait 3 weeks between those rolls, you&#039;ll be fine. But don&#039;t make it a habit and wait 3 weeks every time you want to roll. I would recommend a month between rolls, as I noticed that while you&#039;ll roll fine if you wait 3 weeks, the longer you space them out the harder it&#039;ll hit you. There&#039;s &quot;this feels great, I feel chatty, things tingle, I&#039;m happy&quot; and &quot;this feels amazing, I have to rub up on everyone I know, my skin is electric, I&#039;m ecstatic.&quot; You&#039;ll certainly achieve the first one if you roll every few weeks, but wouldn&#039;t you rather the second?<br /><br />I dunno, just my $.02.

				Thank you for your advice, Addy and Duffman. I&#039;ve decided it would be best to wait until April! Easier on my wallet too. :D

				I would suggest waiting at least three months between MDMA rolls. You are basically blowing out all of your serotonin and need replenishing time to heal.<br />LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and ayahuasca do not need recuperating time... though all could use true integration time.<br /><br />Peace and love,

				il give you some real advice based on my experiences<br /><br />ive rolled every weekend for 4-5 weeks, also waited 1 month, 2 months and 3-6 months in between<br /><br />- there is a definite drop off after the second weekend of rolling, the &quot;magic&quot; is not quite as strong, its still very fun dont get me wrong..<br /><br />- it takes about 3 weeks for the magic to come back, maybe not ALL the way.. but pretty much<br /><br />- one roll per month is pretty much the sweet spot<br /><br />im pretty much never going to roll 2 weekends in a row anymore, i try for 2 months at least, the feeling of a good roll is an amazing thing and you really are not getting the most out of it if you cut the down time short.

				Wait as long as you can possibly stand it! Ecstasy is my favorite high in the world and I would give up just about anything to go back in time and not roll so frequently. <br /><br />The magic has slowly deserted me&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I wait at least three months in between each roll now. Even if this has no effects on tolerance I think it&#039;s good psychologically because it makes each roll special and highly anticipated.

				I roll every 4 months or so, my goal is to roll once every year but I plan on cutting down one roll a year till I am down to one a year so every experience is like my first. But I have always heard at least a month, but I like feeling the fullest effects I can :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper
