				16 hits seems just about right! <br /><br />honestly i dont get much out of acid if i do less then 5.<br /><br />a thumbprint would be EPIC though. <br /><br />these days its a rarity to know someone who has done that much or who is willing to do that much.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know a buddy who drank a whole vial of it. said it was like a DMT trip for 8 hours lol

				my mate new a couple of brothers that both did kung fu and lots of acid....the older one though he was a demon....anyway....one night him and his brother both had a trip each every hour until they reached 10...at that point the older brother declared &quot;I AM A GOD (in satan&#039;s voice) BRING ME A COCONUT!&quot; so....the younger brother and the other guys with them had to go find a coconut at 2am to appease this god or he would have fucked them all up

				you don&#039;t die from &quot;thumbprinting&quot;.&nbsp; You do, however, get permanent HPPD. For the rest of your life.<br />Also, from what I&#039;ve read, in LARGE doses, chances of &quot;bad trips&quot; decrease, and are totally absent in the +10mg range. Seems logical, when your ego is gone, fear is also gone. <br />I would consider doing this when dying or so. Like Huxley.
