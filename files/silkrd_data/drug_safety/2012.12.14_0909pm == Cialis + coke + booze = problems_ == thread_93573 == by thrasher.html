				Just wondering if this is a bad combo. I&#039;m going to meet up with a female friend of mine later and we usually tend to get right fucked on booze and blow and then she tries to get in my pants.&nbsp; However I sometimes seem to get performance isses from this combo, so I thought taking a cialis might help. I&#039;m 25 and am in pretty good shape.&nbsp; &nbsp;ialso tend to take a benzo or zopiclone when coming down. Would this be pushing my luck?

				Sounds like a good combo to me.&nbsp; The only thing I&#039;d be careful of is mixing booze and benzos/zopiclone.&nbsp; That could be bad if you have too much of either or both in combination.&nbsp; Honestly, though, sounds like a fun time to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m jealous.

				If taken in reasonable amounts it just sounds like good fun indeed.<br /><br />Alcohol and benzo&#039;s can be a dangerous combination causing respiratory depression, but that doesn&#039;t happen that commonly as caution against it may lead you to believe.<br /><br />Another thing is the combination of cocaine with cialis, which could put some strain on your cardiovascular system. If you are 25, in good shape, and have to medical conditions that pose a risk i suppose that will not be that dangerous either. <br /><br />There are no guarantees though - if you did happen to have some heart condition that went unnoticed before, it could be dangerous to you, but if that were the case, running up a few flights of stairs may pose a similar risk with much less fun ;)
