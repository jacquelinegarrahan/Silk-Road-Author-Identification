				Hello there ladies and gentlemen...<br />(Are you ready to rock? Lol cheap trick....)<br /><br />Anyway, I just ordered some 2C-B and am excited to try it after what I have heard of it. I&#039;d love to know any tips you all have for my first experience?<br /><br />I think recommended dose is 20mg. Should I start with less and then take more if I feel like I need to, or should I just drop 1 dose and let it take me away? I weigh 100lbs. by the way, kind of underweight from meth use. Speaking of which, will the meth affect the trip? Should I not use meth for any amount of time before or after the trip? Or during?<br />I have heard from some places that 2C-B is horrific for your body, but I have heard from other places that it&#039;s one of the most merciful drugs on your body out there, can anyone verify one or the other? Are there any precautions I should take, like take vitamins before or after or drink lots of water or anything like that?<br /><br /><br />Thanks everyone! &lt;3

				Try 10-15MGs rectally. It really feels better that way. And not just the administeration, I mean. *wink*

				...and another thing. Mixing a small amount of 2C-B, like around 6 MGs with a good dose of M1 has been really fun fer me lately. Everyone else seems to love it too.

				It&#039;s so fucking cool :) <br />I&#039;m still fairly new to it, probably taken it about 10 times. But yeah start low, it&#039;s true what they say about the dose-response curve being steep.<br />I&#039;d say go with 14-16mg if you take it orally, that way you get fully into it and don&#039;t get that tweaked out, not-quite-there psychedelic experience.<br /><br />The first time I did 2C-B was on the tail end of MDMA and it remains my favourite combo. It&#039;s really smooth that way and there&#039;s very little body load- it seems after MD that your body is already &#039;primed&#039; and can deal with additional drugs much more easily. Also the positive push of the MD is there which goes a long way to ensuring you have a good trip. Take it about 2 hours into the MD, the comeup can take quite a while but be patient and don&#039;t redose. Smoking weed seems to help bring on the come up for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;There seems to be a sweet spot around 22mg where you lose the perception of your skin as a boundary, similar to those isolation tanks. This makes for seriously interesting sex. The CEV and OEVs are very cool. For me, the CEVs tend to be lots of very artificial pastel colours and soft, rounded shapes. The OEVs are very digital.<br /><br />Oh and food is 100x tastier- stuff like mangos and ice cream are very palatable on 2C-B.<br />

				From my limited experience it&#039;s fairly easy drug. It seems nicer/more interesting for everyone else, though..:/

				if you do 2cb on meth, do it at the start of a bender, not while you are on the loop. drug induced phycosis is bad enuff without taking a phycadellic :) Be brave and snort it. its almost instant come up and heaps better value for money than taking orally. Yes, it does feel like someone has stabbed you in the face. use only one nostril cos your eye will water. The effects didnt send me inside my own head like acid does. it mixes even better with mdma as meth is quite overpowering to almost everything else. <br /><br />up there with one of the best drugs of all time. :)

				^ What foxy said.<br /><br />2c-b is awesome, one thing to consider is that you&#039;ll need to take around 15% more if you have the HBr salt instead of the HCl salt. 20mg for your first time should be good if you&#039;re orally administering the HBr.

				I&#039;ve been wanting to try it with someone....but I&#039;d heard it can create some*uncomfortable* gastro effects?<br />Thinking of the prospect of having to crap repeatedly and running to the loo just takes all the sexiness out of it for me and makes me hesitant to try it out....<br />or is that a not very common side effect?

I have never had that problem nor had anyone that had that problem.

				I get mild gas/bloating after doing very high doses of 2c-b, and my digestive system is normally a tank. Real mexican food, gallons of beer... nothing can faze it but 40mg of 2c-b sure can. :-D
