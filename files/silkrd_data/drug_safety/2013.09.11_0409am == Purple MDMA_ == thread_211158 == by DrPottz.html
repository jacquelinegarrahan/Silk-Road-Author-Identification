				So some locals have been telling me about some MDMA that was around a bit ago that was purple. They said it&#039;ll be back around, and when it is I obviously will get some and test it.<br />But until then, I&#039;m curious if anybody has any information on what this could be, or how it becomes purple?<br /><br />The said something about doing a &quot;licorice&quot; wash instead of an ampthetamine wash, but when I asked what a licorice wash was they turned around and did something else.<br /><br />Any thoughts help. :)

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I would avoid most colored MDMA, especially international.&nbsp; The best I&#039;ve seen lately is silver super-wash, slightly gray in color.&nbsp; What I think they did, because you could see the evaporated portion, is wash it, pour it into the MBB slightly wet, gently heat and slowly suck the air out with some kind of aspirator, and seal it.&nbsp; Brilliant! the problem I see with impurities is that they stink, pure MDMA has almost no smell.&nbsp; Licorice wash? that would be(I&#039;m reaching here) an aqueous wash where you just pour distilled water through the product in a coffee filter, and re-crystalize, the goop left looks like licorice because it isn&#039;t water soluble.&nbsp; I never hear about people doing this, but I would do it after an acetone wash for sure.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never tried or sold any purple MDMA, but I have seen it, and it can be as good as any other MDMA. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s any less pure or less potent as other ones which have great reputation such as tan or cola. It&#039;s to do with the cooking temperatures and the base (oil - base product) used, or better yet, production method used. I must say, it does look kinda nice...<br /><br /><br />Cheers<br />Meerkovo

				Pure MDMA/HCL is colorless and has no smell. Any other color (tan, purple, brown) or odor (sassafras,licorice, etc.) is just the result of impurities left over from precursors or by products in the synthesis.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take a lot of other chemicals to discolor or create a scent, so you can still have very potent brown or purple &quot;molly&quot; that smells like a root beer float, but it isn&#039;t pure MDMA/HCL. <br /><br />Ironically, a lot of people now think brown is better, so manufacturers have even less incentive to properly wash and purify product.&nbsp;

				No offense to Jack N Hoff in anyway but ive seen that pink methylone floating around my area being sold as MDMA. Which is really fucked up and dangerous. <br />ALWAYS test your shit and if you know of something dangerous is going around, spread the word on what it really is and how to consume safely.

				I&#039;ve seen it around my area and it was supposed to be better than the usual stuff. But I guess no dealer would tell you that his MDMA is worse. Haven&#039;t tried it though.<br /><br />As someone already said, any color means impurities. But even snow white stuff can be less pure than the purple one because impurities can be white too.
