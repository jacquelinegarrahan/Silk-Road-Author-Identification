				I bought some H from italian pilot and snorted it because it was my first time doing H and wasn&#039;t comfortable IV&#039;ng. I got reallllllyyyyy messed up and wound up sleeping it off. The next day or two i noticed all the skin around my nostrils was pealing off. This has never happened to me before and was wondering if this was because of bad cut or is it just me. If its bad cut I would want everyone to know for safety&#039;s sake.<br /><br />Any info would be greatly appreciated.

				I&#039;ve never heard of that happening before with H. I don&#039;t know what cut would cause that. Levimasole in coke can cause bad reactions in some people, but I don&#039;t know if any H is cut with it.<br /><br />The first batch from IP was cut different than the second. When I cooked it the cotton turned almost black on the bottom. I had a histamine reaction when I shot it with my arm getting all warm and red which I usually don&#039;t get except occasionally right around the injection sight. The second batch seemed much cleaner and was like most of the powder I&#039;ve had before cooking relatively clean and causing no adverse reactions.

				Well this was my first time ever doing H so i guess I&#039;m just goin to call it a crazy reaction maybe? I have no clue what goes in to H besides opium poppy stuff. I am probably going to give it another shot in a month or so.. If it happens again with someone else&#039;s product, I&#039;ll know its just me. Which H dealer would be suggested? I would just go with themunchies but he says he wont have any for while. :-\

				I know meth and heroin are completely different things, but when I snorted meth on a regular basis, my nose got really really dry and peeled around my nostrils too. I don&#039;t know, maybe stuff going in your nose just causes some people to have dry skin? Lol :)

				One bag shouldn&#039;t hurt your nose that much. Snorting a lot might mess it up. From Erowid&#039;s H vault: Often it contained a plethera of other agents like pieces of broken glass, pieces of foil, dirt, wood, metal, mannitol, lactose, maltose, sand, you get the idea. I&#039;ve heard B vitamins too.<br /><br />themunchies might have some in stock shortly. Check there. If not, G2G seems legit. Just make sure you understand the risks of customs seizures and early finalizing for international orders. <br /><br />I&#039;ll risk it once to try it. Never has UK stuff before.

				I don&#039;t think cut would have this kind of reaction. When you cut ur dope into lines you should chop it up with a razor as much as possible. Even tho its in powder form it still has rather large crystals in it that will cause pain when you snort it. The better you cut/crush it up, the less it will burn when you snort it and it will absorb faster.

				sounds like you just scratched/rubbed the end of your nose alot while high. i get it alot, sometimes my whole nose will be peeling. not much you can do other then pump yourself full of benadryl while high and it really doesnt work that well and can make you tired. <br />
