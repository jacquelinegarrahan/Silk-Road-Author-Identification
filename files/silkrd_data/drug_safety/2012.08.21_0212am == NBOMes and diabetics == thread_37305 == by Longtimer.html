				I want to hear as many experience reports as possible with diabetics that have used NBOMe.<br /><br />So far, I&#039;ve read 3 and they have all seemed to be fine.<br />This is the latest one I can remember:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15815.msg417876#msg417876">Quote from: A Riotous Defect on August 19, 2012, 12:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />The only qualm I had about it was that I&#039;m a diabetic and found my sugar skyrocketed while I was on it, to over 500. I had to give myself 50+ units of insulin in order to regulate it. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>(was with methylone as well)<br /><br />We also must consider that many tabs contain the HPBCD sugars (mostly).<br /><br />I want a safety report started.

				Its medically impossible for an amount of sugar in tabs to effect your blood glucose to any significant degree, if at all.<br /><br />The methylone was almost certainly the culprit. It&#039;s a stimulant so it mimics fight/flight response which.causes glucose to be released from.your body&#039;s reserves and put into circulation for energy. <br /><br />Even if you glucose does jump up a bit during the trip it shouldnt be of any consequence.as&nbsp; long as you dont feel ill and are.sure to get it back under control.after.the.trip (if you are type 2). If you.are type 1 maybe regulate more tightly. <br /><br />The beauty of 25i is that you are pretty luscent throughout the trip should any issues arise

				As long as your sugar control has been fairly good for the last few months (maybe check current HBA1c?), an acute spike in sugar from a stimulant shouldn&#039;t be too much drama. If possible have a glucose meter and insulin on hand.<br /><br />The big problems arise when you have had a high sugar level for an extended period of time, in which case avoid stims until your HBA1c is normal.

				Thanks so much for the replies.<br />I added in that guy&#039;s report, because all of the other reports have been pretty much 100% fine.<br /><br />This has GREATLY increased my confidence, thank you guys so much.
