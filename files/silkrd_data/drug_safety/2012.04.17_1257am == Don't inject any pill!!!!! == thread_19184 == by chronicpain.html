				As most know, its not very smart to inject a pill. There are many reasons as to why. I know that some will use a wheel filter, which helps a lot and is technically a lot more safe, but I still would be leary of taking the risk. the pill has so many binders, and even the best filtering may be very dangerous.. Especially in the long run.. But, if you must inject a pill, you do make it safer by wheel filtering, but i would still recommend against it.. I would use&nbsp; nasally, or even&nbsp; under the tongue.. I know&nbsp; it may not be the most effective way, but I just would never take the chance.&nbsp; Just dont get too comfy thinking a&nbsp; wheel filter will take all the dangers out.. It doesn&#039;t...<br /><br />If you are still going to inject that pill anyways, at least use a good wheel filter... It just may save your life...

				0.22 or 0.2 micron wheel filters will filter ANY insoluble filler/binder from pills. They filters out bacteria completely even.

				Wheel filters are plastic attachments for Luer Lock syringes that have a round plastic filter disc in them. Anything you squeeze through the syringe+filter has to go through tiny sub-micron pores, which filters out anything insoluble.

				Who the fuck wants to pin a pill anyway? Pills are specifically designed for oral administration and thus a different metabolisation than say IV/IM/Insufflation or whatever Trevor other ways you can take drugs. Doesn&#039;t even make sense to inject a pill anyway if you take that into account. Then on top of that if you think some pills are slow release or whatever then it would make even less sense then. <br /><br />Madness.
