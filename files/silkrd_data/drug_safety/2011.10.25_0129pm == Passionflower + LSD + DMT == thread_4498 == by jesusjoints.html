				Thought i&#039;d start a thread to see if anyone has had any experience with passion flower and lsd<br />or lsd and dmt or dmt and passion flower<br />or passion flower lsd and dmt all at once!<br /><br />Planning to experiment with it soon<br />but i&#039;m a bit unsure of the setting and whatnot.<br />i&#039;d like to be with someone i could trust<br />but those types of people are so hard to come by these days.<br /><br />Any advice to give people of silk road?

				Since you asked so nicely on the other thread, I unfortunately do not have first hand experience with these combinations. Mainly because LSD and DMT are intense enough for me by themselves. I also always just considered MAOIs to be slightly too dangerous for my ease of mind... you should read about the dangers and what to avoid on the Erowid MAOI vault under general info if you are going using them to make sure you stay safe. <br /><br />Passionflower contains the harmala alkaloids, the same ones in B. caapi and syrian rue, just at much much lower concentrations. The actual activity of the MAOI will increase the levels of serotonin which has been indicated to decrease the intensity of trips! However, the harmala alkaloids have other psychoactive activity resembling psychedelics supposedly, which will synergize (but not potentiate) with the trip and alter the nature of the experience (more animalistic and visionary, like ayahuasca reportedly). The harmala alkaloids in ayahuasca are needed so that DMT taken orally is not metabolized before reaching the brain. LSD is not metabolized by MAO so the harmine will not produce the same effect as it does with DMT.<br />More information at (clearnet): http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v06n3/06332ott.html<br /><br />Ayahuasca is dmt + harmala alkaloids, so basically the passion flower will do the same thing, you would just need alot of it. <br />Dmt + lsd definitely seems like an interesting but incredibly intense experience. If you try some of the combinations of two of them, you should have a pretty decent idea of the effects and be more prepared for doing all three. Just make sure to reduce your dosages since they will all be synergizing together.<br /><br />And of note, there is tyramine in some forms of cacti I believe... in case you decide to experiment further. Mescaline also is supposedly dangerous in combination with MAOIs but there are many reports of people using harmala alkaloids for potentiation as well.

				Thank you very very much for that detailed message.<br />I will take this in account.<br />(for the record i&#039;ve experienced both lsd and dmt on their own)
