				Haha, I love this song because the lime in the coconut thing is a pun.<br />1.) The mixed juices of lime (the fruit) and coconut are a traditional remedy for belly aches used by some tropical tribes IIRC.<br />2.) To increase bioavailability, coca leaves are chewed with lime, not the fruit, but calcium oxide. And that&#039;s the pun.<br /><br />Pretty fucking ingenious if you ask me :D
