				I already posted this in off topic but I really need help. please dont delete this! :(&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Hi guys. I need to ask a question about drug testing because im on probation.<br />So I was arrested for drinking and driving in June and was put on probation. Last month I was talking with my probation officer and she was asking me about any drug use. I admitted to useing pot because she said that she would be doing urine tests throughout my probation so I couldn&#039;t lie. So I said that I do use pot but occasionally. I didn&#039;t tell her that I had smoked the night before but I did tell her that I used within the last week or so. (was that a big mistake??)<br /><br />fast forward to recently. We met again and I had to do a urine test again to make sure I was clean (since my first test was positive for pot obviously) or else she said I would be violating my probation terms and would have to go to the judge again. I haven&#039;t smoked anything since the night before the first urine test. and I&#039;m meeting with her in a couple more weeks. Will there still be thc in my system even though its been a month? I&#039;m not a heavy smoker - like 1-2 bowls a week or so, maybe less. I really am worried that there will still be thc even though I havent done anything in a month.<br /><br />does the urine test measure like a yes or no, or is it like a percentage or does it tell you if the person has smoked within the last 24 hours or like 10 days or 30 days?<br /><br />thanks guys. i appreciate any help

The five drugs tested for in standard NIDA approved drug tests. A single use of cannabis may be detected by a typical urine drug test for 1-6 days depending on amount smoked, individual body metabolism rates, and the cutoff level used by the test (15 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml). Chronic or daily use may be detected by a typical urine drug test for 7-30 days depending on the same factors listed above. Lower levels of Cannabinoids do remain in the body for longer than 30 days, but appear unlikely to result in a positive drug test due to cutoff levels.<br />Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is rapidly absorbed by inhalation and the gastrointestinal tract. It is almost completely metabolized. The predominant metabolite is 9-carboxy-11-nor-delta-9-THC, which found in the plasma, feces and urine along with other compounds. Very low concentrations of THC may be detected in urine during the initial several hours, but tetrahydrocannabinol persists in urine at a detectable concentration for many days after smoking.<br />---Onsite Drug Testing<br />The standard THC test is a one step rapid, qualitative immunoassay for the detection of tetrahydrocannabinol compounds (9-carboxy-THC) in urine. The cutoff concentration recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA/NIDA) for a positive result in an immunoassay test is 50 ng/ml. The cutoff for GC-MS is generally 15 ng/ml.<br /><br />Although it is widely claimed that THC metabolites can cause a positive urine test for months after use, a more realistic estimate is closer to 3-4 weeks for chronic users. Toxicologist Paul Cary presents a comprehensive overview of recent research in The Marijuana Detection Window [Drug Court Review, Vol 5(1)]. Cary reviews several studies documenting detection windows greater than 30 days, and finds significant confounds or limitations to design in each of them. He concludes: <br />&quot;Recent scientific literature indicates that it is uncommon for occasional marijuana smokers to test positive for cannabinoids in urine for longer than seven days using standard cutoff concentrations. Following smoking cessation, chronic smokers would not be expected to remain positive for longer than 21 days, even when using the 20 ng/mL cannabinoid cutoff. While longer detection times have been documented in research studies, these prolonged elimination findings represent uncommon occurrences and should not be used as exculpatory evidence in the majority of case adjudications.&quot; (pp. 23-4)<br /><br />Hair Testing<br />Cannabis use is detectable with hair tests and is generally included in the standard hair test. Hair tests generally take the most recent 1.5 inches of growth and use those for testing. That provides a detection period of approximately 90 days. If an individual&#039;s hair is shorter than 1.5 inches, this detection period will be shorter.<br /><br />Saliva Testing<br />In the past few years, new technologies have been developed which allow for saliva testing for the presence of Cannabis (THC). We do not currently have information about what the detection period is for these tests.<br /><br />Blood Testing<br />Cannabis is detectable in the blood for approximately 2-3 days after use in an infrequent user. Frequent use can be detected in the blood for approximately 2 weeks.<br /><br />FALSE POSITIVES #<br />Substances or Conditions which can cause false positives<br />Ibuprofen; (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, Excedrin IB etc)<br />Naproxen (Aleve)<br />Ketoprofen (Orudis KT)<br />Promethazine (Phenergan, Promethegan)<br />Pantoprazole (Protonix)<br />Riboflavin (B2, Hempseed Oil)<br />Kidney infection (Kidney disease, diabetes) Liver Disease<br />Dronabinol (Marinol)<br />Baby Soaps and Shampoos (Cotten SW, et al., 2012)<br />Substances that can reduce detection<br />Papain (from Papaya and also in some meat denderizer) has been shown to reduce the chances of detecting THC metabolites (THCCOOH) in urine in both immunoassay (quick, stick, cup) field tests and with GC/MS. However, with one immunoassay test (KIMS - Roche), it actually increased the chance of detection of THC metabolites. See Larson et al., 2008.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks for the info. what would my probation officer test for? 15ng/ml since it would be really precise? what about those tests from the store, do they test the same level as the court would?

				They&#039;ll just test to make sure the THC metabolite levels are going down, it&#039;s ok if its still in your system as long as the numbers dont rise.

				So do the lab companies tell them that the metabolite levels are going down? or do they just give a pass/fail result? Regardless, I&#039;m not touching anything until I am off probation.<br /><br />also, since my arrest was for alcohol and now im doing urine tests because of pot, will I be able to get my probation reduced since I have everything done (driver intervention program and fines are paid. I also had to have an evaluation by a chemical dependency counselor, which I was told I do not have a dependency issue - with alcohol or pot) or will I have to get my lawyer to take care of this and see if like 2 or 3 negative tests are enough to prove I&#039;m not using anything and get the court to end my probation?<br /><br />thanks for the help.

				i was on probabtion for same shit dui but where i live the county is so large all they do is watch you piss and give a strip test and pour it out no lab as it too expensive to send 100s-1000s everyday so i kept smoking the whole time and just used a drink from GNC so if all they do is a strip test fuck it and keep smoking drinks will always work on strip tests but not lab tests

				I&#039;m pretty sure they send it out to a lab since they collected it in a cup and sealed it shut and I had to verify my name on it. then they put it in a bag in a fridge with other samples. But I don&#039;t know for sure. But it&#039;s good to know that I&#039;ll be fine as long as I don&#039;t smoke (obviously). but I just want to make sure that they can tell from my results that I&#039;m not smoking not just that thc is present or not so pass/fail.<br />

				When they got you like that then your best bet is to walk the line. I was on state probation for 5 years and it was not easy. My charges were not drug related but i did have to take 2 piss test during that time and had the pleasure of the probation officer watching me as I whipped it out and filled up the cup lol.<br /><br />If you will notice everything that you can buy to drink in order to pass a pee test always tells you to drink water after it. So I thought about this and decided to drink water as quick as I could and as much as I could. It did not take but 2 to three hours before I was pissing solid water. I had to monitor my urination and the first couple of times it was yellow which meant to me that it was still contaminated. <br /><br />I agree with bear paw about the exercise. It definitely helps to break a sweat everyday if possible. This helps to keep you clean as well. One definitely has an advantage when drinking lots of water daily along with exercise.<br /><br />I have passed a few test by just getting &quot;water drunk&quot; like that. The more water you drink then it has to exit your body and it pushes thru with less chance of picking up contaminates. If you keep forcing the water down then it has to leave out. I have not used any method for passing the probation type test except for staying clean lol.<br /><br />If you can increase your metabolism and drink plenty of water daily then your chances are better unless your a daily smoker or user of other intoxicants.It&#039;s pretty easy to pass one if you know they are not going to watch you. You can use straight water in a condom and just warm up the temp gauge with a lighter if you can sneak those 2 things in.
