				Ok, so i&#039;ve always wanted to try ecstasy, so bad that I&#039;ve spent roughly $400 over the past 2 or 3 years buying it locally only to get scammed over and over again. Luckily I found SR! First question: I&#039;m planning on buying from SKYY, either the Pink Stars or the MDMA. I want my first time rolling to be amazing, which would you suggest? Question 2: Obviously I don&#039;t have tolerance for it so what is your suggested dose (initial dose, redose, ect.) and timing in between. I would like it to be very intense but not take so much that I have a bad experience. Thanks in advance for any responses!

				Since it&#039;s your first time, I&#039;d recommend going with the Pink Stars unless you have a milligram scale so you can better judge how much you are taking. And I&#039;d have to agree with Holly, just about anything turns amazing, especially music. Getting up and dancing your face off just feels so amazing. It&#039;s also hard to give you judgement on how much to take for your first time because your size and natural tolerance. The dose i feel i enjoy the most, being a 140 lb male, is and initial dose of around 150 mg and then another 75 an hour or so in.

				Go for it OP! It&#039;s the best feeling in the world. :)<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d go to a rave of the music of your choice. I would always hit Fabric or Ministry of Sound personally but that&#039;s just me!

				If you take 5HTP every day a week before the show/event (and not the day of the show) it supposedly builds up your serotonin to make your rolling better. I haven&#039;t tried it yet but plan on starting tomorrow for a show on 4/20.

Start with a half, and after redose with a quarter after 2 hours.

				Thanks for all the comments guys! For anyone who has used SKYY before, do the pink stars and the MDMA give you the same general feeling?

				If it is your first time any good pill here will give you an amazing time, it doesn&#039;t have to be incredibly strong. On my first time i rolled great on a shitty pill around where I&#039;m at thats like (70mg).

				Get yourself some Mind Food if Tryptamine decides to list it again. <br /><br />Take some 2 hours before rolling and one more the morning after to minimize any hangover affects. <br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t come beforehand, add some vitamins A, C, and E to your multivitamin. <br /><br />As for magnesium, I&#039;ve seen people recommend between 500mg to 1g. Make sure it&#039;s chelated and take it throughout the day every 3 hours or so until you roll and more before bed. Basically take as much as you can tolerate. <br /><br />Oh, take some tums about 30 minutes before taking your E ... will minimize the nausea during come-up.

				<br />Take about 1.5 grams of Vitamin C its water soluble so you&#039;re not going to have any problems if you take to much of it and its really important in reducing the oxidative stress MDMA places on your brain.<br /><br />there are several supplements you can take and Dancesafe and Errowid have good guides on them but the 3 most important are:<br /><br />Vitamin C <br />Magnesium<br />5-HTP

				It&#039;s possible to have a bad experience on MDMA?&nbsp; ???<br />100mg is a good starting dose, with maybe a 30-60 mg booster half way through.

				I think it&#039;s important to take e on an empty stomach - I think this is true for stimulants in general. <br /><br />If your planning on rolling in the evening I&#039;d eat breakfast and a small lunch, and then no solids just liquids (water, and Gatorade)- I&#039;d save the orange juice until your an hour or so into your trip, otherwise the acid might breakdown the e. I find weed really brings the roll to another level, and I usually smoke a blunt an hour or so into the trip.<br />

				I&#039;d say 100mg is a great first time dose. That was mine and I had a transcendent experience. Now, it doesn&#039;t come as close, so I have to do more to get that effect; normally I do 200 mg, but others do even more per dose.<br /><br />Also, IMO don&#039;t ever snort MDMA, it hurts, doesn&#039;t last as long, and has a shorter peak. NOT WORTH IT! I personally love to mix it into a fruity, sweet drink, like lemonade.
