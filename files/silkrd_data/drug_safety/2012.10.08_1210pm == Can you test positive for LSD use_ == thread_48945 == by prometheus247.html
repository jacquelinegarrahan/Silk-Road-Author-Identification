				Hi guys,<br /><br />I have a friend that was busted for drug possession (it was a set-up by the very noble police force of my country) but anyhow he regularly has to give samples for the agency to check he is clean of drugs as part of the deal he had to agree.<br /><br />Now it&#039;s certain that marijuana will show up in the tests but we were wondering if there is any way they can tell if he does LSD. From the little knowledge I got on the subject from reading Hoffman&#039;s book he said the dose is so miniscule it still has an effect on you even after the substance exits your body. I take that as an indication that you cannot test positive for LSD use. What is more, my friend checked what substances they test him for and he didn&#039;t see LSD listed. When he asked they told him it can show up cause of some link with amphetamines but again from my understanding of things this claim is bullshit cause LSD has nothing to do with them. <br /><br />Your thoughts will be much appreciated!

				it is possible to test for but it is not covered by the standard 6 panel or extended 12 panel tests...they&#039;d have to test for it specifically if they were gonna test for it...<br /><br />-----CLEARNET LINK-----<br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_testing.shtml<br />-----CLEARNET LINK-----<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">LSD<br />Drug Testing<br />by Erowid<br />SUMMARY #<br />U.S. DRUG TESTING SUMMARY<br />LSD<br />Tested for in Standard Drug Tests?<br />NO<br />Tested for in Extended Drug Tests?<br />NO<br />Possible to Test for?<br />YES<br />Detection Period in Urine<br />1-4 days (including metabolites)<br /><br /><br />TEST TYPES #<br />Urine Testing<br />It is possible to test for the presence of LSD in urine, but it is a very difficult and expensive test to run and is very uncommon. Unless there is a particular reason to be looking for it, as in the case of an autopsy...it is extremely unlikely that most people will ever run into this test. It is not one of the SAMHSA-5 standardly tested for in the basic drug test, nor is it included in the extended drug tests. It is not chemically similar to any of the drugs tested for, so should not trigger the tests as another substance.<br /><br />An LSD metabolite created by the body called 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD has a somewhat longer half-life than LSD itself and is one of the main metabolites used to test for LSD use. Although most LSD-specific tests only test positive for less than two days, the metabolite tests for 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD are effective for 3-4 days after LSD ingestion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Many thanks gestaltassault2!<br /><br />By the way unrelated but I always wondered.. why is it dangerous to share clearnet links on SR? If I copy paste in my normal browser under normal connection, assuming I don&#039;t mind those people spying where I visit websites.. is there any way those links can act as a trojan horse to my TOR/SR communications?

				I&#039;ve heard that LSD disapear (not totally- but about 98%) after the end of effects. It means that if you get caught while tripping, if they test you they&#039;ll find LSD but after the comedown, it&#039;s not possible.<br /><br />
