				i was wondering if anyone could give me any advise.. when i first started smoking weed, about a year and a half ago and about once or twice a week, it was amazing, every high seemed to give me a beautiful euphoric experience. But then after about 2 months of this, i was drunk and went for joint. I smoked way to much and i then had the worst drug experience ever in my life. I was sick, passed out and had a massive panic attack. <br />I was then put into a state for de-realisation and de-personalization and suffered with minor cases of PTSD caused by the panic attack for about 2 months afterwards.<br />Thus i gave up on the weed for about 6 months but i&#039;ve slowly just kind of got back into it (about twice a month recently). but every time i have smoked it since this awful experience, its just made me have a high that made me paranoid and anxious.<br />Obviously i want to get back into weed and i&#039;m wondering if anyone has had simular problems to me that can give me advise into getting my good highs back?

				Are you smoking the same weed strain?<br />Is your current emotional status the same as when you first smoked?<br /><br /><br />

				Never was good for me... First few times I smoked I didn&#039;t feel much... after a few times of smoking it made me feel sedated and agitated. They say its a social drug, it&#039;s not for me. Quite the opposite in fact... I do smoke when I&#039;m rolling because I love its effect with MDMA.<br /><br />My advice is to stop smoking... I know many people who have smoked for years and suddenly BAM they no longer get a good feeling from it. I guess you can try smoking different strains, however I&#039;m not really experienced with it so can&#039;t give advice on that.<br /><br />Sollemnis

But everytime i&#039;ve smoked its produced the same results ever since this experience. <br />And no probably not, I&#039;m suffering with a bit of anxiety. When i first started i was content with life.<br />But another thing i&#039;ve noticed is that i start to panic before i start to smoke, i have thoughts like &#039;what if this experience happens again&#039; so maybe this is causing the bad high?

But thanks for the help.&nbsp; :)

				I would suggest sticking to milder sativas, that give you more of an elated/happy/energetic high.&nbsp; If you find the effects to be too strong, smoke organic outdoor strains because the THC content is lower and your high could possibly be affected by hydro-grown product that hasn&#039;t been flushed properly and has fertilizer and such in it still.&nbsp; At least when you get organic out, you know it&#039;s straight up cannabis and you aren&#039;t going to get blasted off into space with a few tokes.

				Smoke in a clean environment, and in a place where you know nothing can fuck you over for the next few hours. Then sit back and relax, you have nothing to worry about lol, put on the xbox and play some games to take your mind off paranoia.<br /><br />Try using a bong and getting a really stoney indica, so that you&#039;ll be just so stoned no panic attacks can happen.

				Same shit here, there was a period of a few months where I smoked every day and loved it, now every time I smoke even a little bit I get horribly nauseous and faint. By the time I&#039;m able to stand up again I&#039;m stuck with a terrible headache for the rest of the day.

				Both I and people I&#039;ve known have had the same experience. Lay off weed for a while, perhaps years. Quit it entirely if you have to. I don&#039;t know why, but smoking too much weed can lead to anxiety and paranoia. It&#039;s not a big deal, you just can&#039;t smoke weed for the indefinite future.

				If suffering from anxiety issues i would recommend smoking some indica, it produces more of a couch lock stone opposed to a Euphoric high htough. I personal find the sedation effects of Indicas are just right for calming my brain down into not over thinking things and working myself up into a paranoid state.<br /><br />Due to UK laws and the nature of this job&nbsp; i quite offten suffer from anxiety issues when smoking Sativa strains, the euphoric high just makes my brain go into overdrive and i can easily over think things.
