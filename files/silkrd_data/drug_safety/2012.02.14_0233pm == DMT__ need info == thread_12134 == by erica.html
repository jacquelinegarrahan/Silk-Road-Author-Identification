				I was listening to that BBC podcast about the &quot;dark web&quot; and he mentioned buying &quot;DMT&quot; (which I&#039;m sure he really just destroyed lol) but it made me curious.<br />I tried looking it up but couldn&#039;t find much &quot;real experience&quot;.....it looks like powder on SR but what does it do? Is it like an acid trip? I&#039;ve had those and they were kinda fun. My friends &amp; I would do 3-4 of those square acid trips at once and it was just a consistant nice trip... but how would u use DMT? (I don&#039;t do needles). Do u dip finger in powder and lick it or smoke it in a cigarette?<br /><br />What kind of effects does it have? What version or dose would be good?<br />I&#039;ve been on opiads for pain so long that it feels like nothing ever effects me...I&#039;ve always had a super high tolerance to most things that would kill the average person and i take such low doses of opiads so it sux.<br /><br />I just wondered if this was something I could enjoy....I like to understand the things I plan to try<br /><br />Thanks in advance. :)<br /><br />.

				DMT is the spirit molecule. Supposed to be one of the most potent psychedelics too. Very, very complex shapes and patterns and colors, seeing different types of entitys, shared experiences with other DMT users. I wanna try it so bad myself!

				It hits you in a wave of vibrations. followed by intense open and closed eyed visuals. (depending on the dosage) I smoked mine outta a bong with Damiana/DMT/Damiana. Just sit down and relax. You prolly don&#039;t want your friends talking around you as that could screw your trip up and trip you way out. Just go into a Deemz trip with a clear mindset. If you are interested in meditation, try that first. just be call. there is nothing to be worried about when you do it.

				I suggest checking out the DMT Nexus. The answers to pretty much any of the questions you have should be there.<br /><br />I could probably answers most of the questions you have. Basically you just want DMT freebase to vaporize. It wouldn&#039;t take much to give you the kind of experience you&#039;re looking for.

				50mg vaporized will send you to places you&#039;ve never dreamed of before. You can also do it off of foil, but it&#039;s gonna taste like shit and burn your lungs. Get a vapor genie or another vaporizer. You won&#039;t taste anything but you&#039;ll feel the heat. 1st hit hold for about 10-15 seconds and release. Take the 2nd hit as big as you can and hold it for as long as you can and we&#039;ll be seeing you on the other side... <br /><br />You can also take an MAOI beforehand to prolong the experience. DMT is broken down extremely quickly in the body without it. Without an MAOI you&#039;re experience will be between 5-15 minutes per trip. <br /><br />I do wanna say however MAOIs cause problems in some people. You should do your own research and see if they are safe for you and any other drug combinations you may take.

Those are different things entirely. When someone refers to DMT, they mean N,N-Dimethyltryptamine. So&nbsp; go with the one that says just DMT, NN-DMT, or DMT freebase.<br /><br />You could use DMT all night if you wanted to, I&#039;ve never noticed much tolerance after about an hour or so. However, once you try it you probably wouldn&#039;t want to use it all night. As themessenger2 said, do 50 milligrams and the world as you know it will disappear.<br /><br />You can use a bong, you just have to use the sandwich method. You put a layer of herbs(anything you want), then a layer of DMT, followed by another layer of herbs or ash or whatever you used. You would then take your lighter and hold it over the bowl without touching it since you don&#039;t want to burn it. You just want it close enough to melt the DMT. Then take a couple hits and blast off into hyperspace.

				Erica. All those questions cannot be answered on a thread like this. <br />DMT is another thing. Listen to Terence Mackenna talk about it, read &quot;The Spirit Molecule&quot; and watch the documentary about it, read about ayahuasca, read the DMT-nexus forum... This isn&#039;t just another drug. No partying, no going out with friends, no just to try... bla bla bla..<br />What is it? Where does it come from?<br />love.&nbsp;

That is exactly the information I was looking for. The DMT mentioned earlier in this thread being sold by Moon Unit was what I ended up purchasing. He was nice enough to just sell me a gram since everyone said I didn&#039;t need that much (5 g he was selling). Then I also ended up buying a glass pipe from someone on SR also (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/7465) since I am not a pot smoker and don&#039;t have any weed to mix it with. The link I posted above is the pipe listing so if you look at it, maybe you can tell me if this is all I will need. If it is, can I just put the DMT in to it alone without any weed?<br />I do have a high tolerance to just about any drug I try. Occasionally the first time trying something will work out okay but for some reason, I can build a tolerance superfast. I take pain medicine regularly and can only take it once every two days if I want it to work well..... If I want to try another drug, I literally have to stop taking my pain med for at least a week and a half or other things usually don&#039;t work. I don&#039;t even take a high dose. So I always worry that when people tell me to take a certain amount, like mentioned here about taking 50 mg of the DMT, then it won&#039;t be enough for me. If I took 60 mg would it hurt me?<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t plan on being alone and I will do what you said and make sure the other person is not doing it at the same time. Thank you so much for your input.

Done up to 100mg and had a wonderful trip. I&#039;m not aware of any physical health dangers at these levels and personally experienced none. However, I&#039;d still recommend working your way up. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12134.msg117986#msg117986">Quote from: MailMaxDev on February 19, 2012, 02:40 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do the visual patterns you see on LSD compare to DMT? I remember lying down on LSD and staring at the patterns on my walls and ceiling for god knows how long just thinking about how cool they looked.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />DMT is largely a Closed-eyed experience. When you hear the term &quot;breakthrough&quot; it refers to when you break from this reality to DMT hyperspace. You will no longer be in a room with walls or pictures to look at. Your eyes will be closed and you will be seeing what can&#039;t really be described by words because it is so fundamentally different from our reality that to know it is to experience it. <br /><br />Generally on &lt;30mg doses I won&#039;t breakthrough and will experience some a very peaceful head space and some Open Eyed Visuals such as textures and edges becoming very sharp, patterns are intriguing, and maybe some waves of color flowing through walls. Based on some readings I&#039;ve done as well as some personal experiences, when dosing outside there tends to be a stronger presence of entities in your OEVs. I&#039;ll see them pre and post breakthrough, as well as on some almost-breakthrough doses. Usually shadowed figures gathered around and watching me trip. Most seem excited and encouraging, some make gestures towards items or doors. <br /><br />Once you reach breakthrough level doses (30-50mg, or for me 50+mg) I find there are a few different levels you may encounter. <br />The first thing I always encounter on a breakthrough is the jim-jam. Incredibly vivid colors and geometric patterns covering an ever-twisting and contorting blob. I may be zooming past this blob or it may be drastically shifting it&#039;s perspective in relation to me. I can feel it pulling at my emotions whenever it moves and it&#039;s pure beauty leaves me in awe.<br />After I break beyond the jim-jam, the REAL fun begins. Telepathy, entities, ego death, slipping between dimensions, elevators to different and lives and realities, anything is possible.<br />I generally encounter an entity at this point (though not always) who seems to be welcoming me to hyperspace. I&#039;ve seen a Jester in front of a very high-tech display of maybe 15 vertically-rotating TV displays, with a new screen displayed at each turn. I&#039;ve also encountered a shadowed woman (to my right) who welcomes me to the most beautiful temple. It is built like an ancient temple, but the materials were unlike any I had seen. Resembled a pulsating plasma of every color you could imagine, with what seemed to be guards decorated in the same plasma-like material. The woman welcomed me to the temple by distorting the door into a bubble that bent towards me (Donnie Darko style) and took me in.<br /><br />Upon leaving hyperspace and entering your body again I find the visuals to be very much like a high dose mushroom or LSD trip, though they quickly fade and are gone after ~30 minutes. I find my post-breakthrough mindset to be one of gratitude. I appreciate my life, the world I&#039;m blessed with, and the experiences I am able to have. Hyperspace is so much different from Earth that I now find happiness in the smallest of things here on Earth. The trips are all quite profound for me as well in one way or another. Definitely a great substance for some soul searching or self analysis. I&#039;ve had trips illustrate small behaviors I hadn&#039;t recognized I had, such as how often I say &quot;I just...&quot; or the reason I had been feeling a little off all week was because I was caught up in my routine and took no time to enjoy the moments.<br /><br />My general words for first time trippers:<br />- Before tripping: Clear your mind of anything other than focus on the trip. Meditate or slow breathing before dosing to ease entry to hyperspace.<br />- Don&#039;t be afraid. DMT trips are full of love and learning. Any seemingly harmful experience will NOT harm you.<br />- While dosing, take large tokes and hold them in for 10-20 seconds! Take 3-4 tokes for a breakthrough.<br />- While tripping, have a fucking blast and learn something profound.<br /><br />

				If you do seek a longer experience with N,N-DMT (or any other monoamine), then co-administration with an MAOI will lengthen the presence of the entheogen. Syrian rue (Peganum harmala) could be used here. Mixing a small quantity of the seed powder with the freebase DMT and smoking that (I have heard using a bong is effective for this) being careful with the dosage, since the presence of the various harmala alkaloids with amplify the effects of the DMT. This creates a mixture which I have heard called changa.<br /><br />This would be somewhat similar in effect to the mixing of plant products containing MAOIs and various psychoactive tryptamines (which are monoamines as far as I know) in ayahuasca.

Thank you so much for your input.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I also have a high tolerance to just about everything, and yet DMT manages to affect me within a few milligrams of vapor. I&#039;ve gone all the way up to 100mg in a single load or more, but honestly that much at once is awkward to handle in the pipe all at once, it melts and becomes a goo and in fact can spill if you don&#039;t orient the pipe right.<br /><br />The pipe you bought is a freebase pipe, not for weed at all. It&#039;s a stem with a globe at the end and a hole at the top of this globe for ventilation (this is NOT a carb). The freebase powder is loaded into the bottom of the bulb, and then heat is applied to the bottom of the glass by a lighter held a ways below it. The powder will melt, and then start to boil. The vapors will swirl around, and at this point you can start to hit it. You may not need to keep applying heat, as the glass will hold some for awhile. Its a gentle boiling we&#039;re looking for, not an incineration. N,N-DMT melts at 40 °C (104 °F) and boiling point according to wikipedia has been reported both at 160 °C (320 °F) @ 0.6 Torr and as 80 - 135 °C @ 0.03 Torr.<br /><br />Consider that a flame is much hotter than 320 °F. If you overheat the DMT, especially an extraction that has not been extensively recrystalized (such as Moon Unit&#039;s, which isn&#039;t a bad thing), you will cause polymerization, which will make for a bad taste, and a nasty black stain in the bottom of the pipe that is nigh impossible to remove.<br /><br />A milligram scale would be ideal.. But honestly, I did mine without one. I used a straw to collect crystals, and then inserted the straw through the stem of the pipe, depositing the powder in the globe.<br /><br />It would be a decent investment to get a refillable butane lighter. A torch style lighter might be helpful, but really what I am suggesting is any high quality lighter that can be lit for some time, and the flame of which burns clean (if you use, for example, 5x filtered butane, you will see less soot on the bottom of the globe). Using a disposable lighter, or any low grade butane will create a sooty flame that mars the outside of the pipe (and hey, think.. people inhale that soot directly when they light up their cigarette/weed/whatever).<br /><br />I would NOT recommend using a blow torch. Might sound like a good idea, but that&#039;s exactly the kind of tool that was used to make this (albeit on a smaller scale).. So the very hot flame from a blow torch would run a high risk of heating the glass to the point that it&#039;s malleable. (which is how pipes like this are made in the first place).<br /><br />Like I said at the beginning of this post, I have a typically high tolerance to any sort of substance. I experienced open-eye visuals rather easily with DMT. That&#039;s something no other substance has done for me before. <br /><br />

Could anyone tell me about the entities I saw on LSD? When I was coming up I started seeing flower fractals everywhere. By the time I was 2 hours in everywhere I looked there were faces and this continued for a large portion of the trip. Whether I was looking at a door, a textured ceiling or water droplets in the shower they were always there. It would alternate between something that looked like a demon and something very similar to this but maybe more feminine:<br />http://iheardin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Alex-Grey-Net-of-Being.jpg

				The seeing faces thing, whilst i didn&#039;t get it personally the one time i LSD-tripped hard, i understand it from more subtle trips as our psyche trying to personify everyday objects. <br />Consider it a sort of easing you in notion of how inanimate objects are connected to us and our ever growing egos.

Some of it will oxidize and turn into some kind of polymer (the liquid) that won&#039;t give off smoke, but while there is liquid that will boil into smoke, then there is still active ingredient in there. Remember, there&#039;s over 100 degrees of temperature difference between where the crystal melts, and where the liquid boils.<br /><br />And don&#039;t worry about being a n00b, everyone is at some point. :)

				Thanks, I think it got harsh cuz the flame was too close &amp; bowl was filled with white smoke &amp; I hit it while still lighting. Even though I coughed it out quick, things definitely looked different instantly. Not crazy, just noticed lots of patterns and stuff a bit clearer. This only made me REALLY want a breakthrough....the small trip was cool.<br />Also I felt like I burned my lip once but it went away. Thanks for understanding and helping. I don&#039;t have any weed or I&#039;d try that. I have a pipe a friend left here awhile ago but I never smoke weed.<br /><br />Oh and when i heated slower, I couldn&#039;t get enough smoke or vapor....guess I need practice.

				Definitely takes a little practice to get the dosing right. As mentioned, the taste and energy/electricity will also become more pleasant as you get more familiar with DMT. However, I&#039;ve found applying too much heat too quickly will cause more of a burnt synthetic taste. <br /><br />With a freebase pipe I find it easiest to use a torch lighter and keep the flame about 2 inches from the pipe. I try to move the flame as well so it doesn&#039;t hit a single spot too long. Hold the flame there for a short moment, then start breathing in slowly. It won&#039;t light immediately, but it will be heating up and vaporize shortly after you begin inhaling. You are basically trying to get the glass hot enough to vaporize, not burn, the DMT. Turning to a liquid is normal as well, another appeal to leaf blends, just keep applying heat at usual. Once it has turned into a liquid just be sure to tilt the pipe slightly away so nothing ends up dripping on your lips. It will burn the shit out of you! <br />

Simply dry out some fresh herbs, crush them up, and voila, a nice mild accompanying herb that will not have any effect on your experience. If you wanted to take it a step further, get yourself some Caapi leaves, Passionflower, or any type of MAOI that works well with DMT, and use that for the sandwich method, or even make some changa.

				OK I&#039;m finding this harder than I thought. This glass ball pipe burned my lungs, lips, tongue &amp; it f*cken hurt! How long does it take to vaporize?<br />Problem is, I see smoke start coming out ball hole but never see any think milky smoke like everyone says should happen. Sometimes I toke it and feel &quot;something&quot; going into my lungs but no smoke blows out if I actually get to hold it without coughing. Twice I got a small enough hit to feel a little buzzed but nothing amazing....buzz felt fun though. Next time I inhaled I swore I inhaled fire it hurt so bad.<br /><br />My friend uses a regular weed pipe to smoke weed. Is that what kind u use to sandwich dmt? He says he has a bong too. I keep hearing the glass pipe I got is better though. You don&#039;t put ashes in my pipe right? Also the melted dmt is all stuck to the glass. Can u clean these glass pipes? Am I smoking burnt dmt over again.<br /><br />The lighter gets so hot so i tried holding it over a candle flame instead (not the best cuz flame was so small.<br />Should I see a lot of vapor before toking? I don&#039;t.<br /><br />Why is this so hard lol..... I feel like I&#039;m sooooooo close. I need a smoking dmt with a glass ball pipe for dummies lol<br /><br />Thanks for your patience with me,,,,u guys have been a godsend! <br />

				Your heat source is probably the issue. Go buy some type of cheap torch lighter and use that to vaporize the DMT. Like someone said on here earlier, there is about a 100 degree difference between the DMT melting into a liquid state, and that liquid boiling, giving off the vapor. You&#039;re obviously holding the flame there far too long if you&#039;re burning yourself because of conduction, and the heat source is obviously not hot enough to vaporize the spice.<br /><br />Like I said, if you want a pretty dummy proof method for your first time, sandwich it. Take about 2 or 3 screens, put one or two screens on the bottom, another on top to sandwich it, and top it with either dried parsley or mint. Light the parsley, and the heat will effectively, although not efficiently, vaporize the DMT. You will need a bit more for a breakthrough, but I assume that isn&#039;t an issue. Either that or build the machine, or buy a Vapor Genie sherlock.

If you achieve a break thru be prepared for life changing effects. It is not like acid, it is like acid on steriods with the ability to rock the very core of who you are. It will last 5-10 minutes and make sure to close your eyes, environment can also play a part. I have never used any fancy pipe, just a regular bowl, i put it ontop of pot leaf or herbal mix and hold the lighter slightly above. Try not to directly scorch it. It will be OK if it burns. It WILL stink like mothballs or something similar. That is normal. I have found that 3 or 4 deep lungfulls held in as long as possible will do the trick. Be sitting down, and remember if it gets too intense just open your eyes for a few seconds. It has changed my life, Love and Light to you Sister. Feel free to contact me if you are so inclined

If you&#039;re talking about a freebase pipe, hell no. When dealing with the sacred spice, that&#039;s ALL you want to deal with. DMT needs to be taken very seriously, and hopefully very spiritually. When dealing with any psychedelic, let alone DMT, I meditate prior to and after. It gives me a far deeper and more introspective, as well as retrospective view of what I just experienced. Don&#039;t mix it with weed, and don&#039;t mix it with coke, especially if you&#039;re not fully prepared for a real breakthrough. Keep trying with a freebase pipe, with just the DMT. If you&#039;re not breaking through, then you&#039;re obviously doing something very wrong, and wasting precious spice, which I would then recommend you to attempt another method.

That really gave me some of the strangest and most hilarious DMT trips I&#039;ve had to date. Definitely had a tripping vibe of &quot;you&#039;re doing it wrong and shouldn&#039;t be in hyperspace, but while you&#039;re here look at what we can do!&quot; The resin trips were less purposeful and were filled with ever-morphing objects and not easily describable events. I guess it was less of a spiritual journey and more of a spiritual &quot;hiiii guys! what&#039;s up!?&quot; I always came out of those trips laughing my ass off.

				My latest conclusion is that without a torch lighter, its mostly a waste of time to try and freebase DMT. After getting it, I was able to properly finish off my latest batch from Moon Unit (which was deligtful nonetheless). A regular lighter just doesn&#039;t get hot enough quick enough, and the result tastes bad, plus doesn&#039;t get you where you were meaning to go.<br /><br />All that black shit on my freebase pipe? apparently all I needed to do was heat it with a torch lighter and it&#039;ll just vaporize. Figures. Anyway, now I&#039;ve got a cleanish pipe again, and got to experience the last bit of it properly. Ah well.. Its not like I won&#039;t get some more and try again :) Even when I don&#039;t achieve visual or breakthrough experiences, the spiritual effects are amazingly world changing and intense. Not too hard to handle though.. I remember the first time I smoked 5-MeO-DMT, I was writhing around screaming &#039;I&#039;m real! OMG! I&#039;m real!&#039;.. DMT isn&#039;t quite like *that* for me, but it holds such a special place in my heart, no matter what kind of the many experiences I receive from it; they&#039;re all fascinating and oh so interesting.
