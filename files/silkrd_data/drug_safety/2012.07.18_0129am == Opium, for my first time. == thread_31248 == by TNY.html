				I like to think of myself as an educated drug user, i like to familiarize&nbsp; myself with everything i put into my body and their effects on me before and after, on my mood, their addictive potential all that stuff.<br /><br />I have done most drugs out there at this stage, except opiates, but i have been wanting to try opium for 10 years plus now and since i have access to clean proper stuff through the Silken road im going to go for it and as soon as my wallet is funded with bitcoins i plan on buying 1gram of Opium to take for my first time ever.<br /><br />Can anyone advise me the best way to smoke this is? can i use a pipe or my bongs? i smoke around 3g green a day through bongs so ive got good ironlung. Can i just put this on a steel gauze and smoke it through that? how does it burn?&nbsp; is it ok to do alone? Whats your recommended dose to do for a fellas first &quot;trial&quot; hit? i have a .000g scales so my weights will be bang on,<br /><br />Im sure id get these answers on erowid or google but lets humanize this place some more and give a fellow journeyman some sound personal advice please!<br /><br />Also whos got the best opium for sale?!

				Man, opium is one of the things I would love to try. One of those drugs with such a long and ancient history, but sadly near impossible to find nowadays with the rise of pharmaceuticals and heroin. Strangely, not even SR seems to have it right now.<br /><br />It&#039;s my understanding that smoking opium requires a special opium vaporizing pipe. It&#039;s not really smoked, in much the same way as crack cocaine. Dosage is about a tenth of a gram. In fact, if you&#039;ve ever seen the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, there&#039;s some great opium den scenes for what I&#039;m talking about.

				This just went up a day or two ago: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0b97222717<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />My suggestion would be to make whatever Tea/Coffee you like - wait till the temp drops below around 70 degrees C (wait 10 mins basically), then stir in 100mg opium and give it a couple hours!<br /><br />After sampling most of what Silf Road has to offer, and hanging back rather content for now, the occasional g of opium is a wonderful thing. Especially for around a $50.
