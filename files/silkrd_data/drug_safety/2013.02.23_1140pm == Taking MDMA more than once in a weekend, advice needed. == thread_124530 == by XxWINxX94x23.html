				So we all know that many music festivals are more than 2 days long. The specific one I will be attending is 3 days long. I&#039;ve been taking MDMA for more than a year now, always at least a month spaced out. I can count the number of times I&#039;ve rolled on two hands. Always take multi-vitamins and 5-HTP before and after.<br /><br />My question to those with more knowledge and experience than I is this:<br /><br />Is there any safe way or best practice to taking MDMA twice in a 3 day period? <br /><br />Obviously people do this, no matter how bad it is. As much as I would like to refrain from such frequent use, this is going to be one epic festival and I will absolutely hate not rolling while everyone else is going hard. I was considering rolling on day 1 and 3 only. The rolls would be spaced out approximately 48 hours and I do not take over 250mg in a night. Still up in the air about it, and any significant information presented here could change my mind.<br /><br />For what its worth I will also not be rolling for 4 months prior to this festival.<br /><br />Any useful information for me? I would like to hear some of your experiences! thanks

				You will be fine. Judging by your stated mdma use, rolling twice in that weekend shouldn&#039;t have you feeling too crappy afterwards, especially if you&#039;re eating fruits &amp; veggies and taking multivitamins... you should take 5-htp only after your 2nd roll I&#039;d say, only because I am against pre-loading with and and CERTAINLY against taking 5-htp in combination with mdma- if you do that all the time when you roll you are asking for serotonin syndrome (NOT FUN). I first started rolling 3 years ago and my first year experimenting I did some pretty stupid things, including rolling 3 days in a row, etc. I wasn&#039;t even getting hungover from that back then, but nowadays I try to keep at least a month between use and a healthy diet and take antioxidants while rolling and before/after too as well as 5-htp after and I can get some lame hangovers, but that&#039;s usually if I&#039;m taking 300-400mg in a night. ~200-250mg area and I don&#039;t feel much of a hangover the next day. Judging from my personal experience (sounds like I&#039;ve used mdma more often and for a longer period than you) and your experience, I wouldn&#039;t be worried. Have fun!

Try 2CB or GHB when the peak/plateau ends and it will extend the experience nicely.<br /><br />Day 3,&nbsp; Perhaps a psychadelic like Moxy, LSD, or 4 aco dmt. Or just roll again.<br /><br />Be ready to feel pretty shitty and if you can help not having to work or school.<br /><br />watch your doses very closely and make a plan and stick to it based on your body / self.<br /><br />most people usually start with a plan and then wake up a few days later after a crazy bender / binge and wonder wtf happened. I know I&#039;ve been there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your close but I&#039;m actually going to EDC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken M1 before and my experience was that its similar to a roll, but lacks the body high and energy of real MDMA. Doesn&#039;t it work the same way as MDMA though, on serotonin receptors? I will most likely be taking some LSD one of those days as well. I&#039;m really just waiting for the lineup to come out so I can plan this stuff out better. If the lineup isn&#039;t up to my standards on the third day, I&#039;ll probably just skip out on that.<br />Most likely going to try and take some M1 to start day 1, then pop a roll when it gets later.<br /><br />Day 2 probably taking LSD to start, maybe a light candy-flip of some sorts. Some of my friends might be drinking as well, so I may stick with that.<br /><br />Really depending on the lineup, I hate when these big festivals don&#039;t release anything!<br /><br />Thanks for the info guys, unfortunately I still have no idea what I really wanna do without some sort of schedule.

				It seems like you&#039;re a responsible drug user and not an abuser at all. You&#039;ll figure it out!<br /><br />All I can say is make sure you eat well, sleep or at least for a bit every night and keep track of your mind. If you do that even doing (quality) MDMA all three days won&#039;t matter that much, just as long as you keep it together and rebuild your reserves afterwards.<br /><br />I wish you a lot of fun and euforia!

Could you recommend a good Methylone/M1 vendor if you happen to be from the USA? I will definitely be picking some of that up.

				You might want to look into MDA. I&#039;m not sure how it works as I haven&#039;t made the plunge into purchasing/experimenting with it yet but I hear it doesn&#039;t cross-tolerate with MDMA but provides for a comparable (and to some superior) experience. This may mean that you can use MDMA one day and MDA on another without as severe of complications as trying to use MDMA multiple times. <br /><br />I&#039;m no expert on how MDA works so please do your homework if you want to look into using this drug. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				XxWINxX94x23 <br /><br />Glad to hear you&#039;re making it to EDC. This will be my third year going and for my first EDC in Cali I was freaking out about the same thing. A few dozen festivals later and we seem to have figured out what works for US, but its taking a lot of experimenting with the process. <br /><br />About 14 days leading up to it, I&#039;ll take an htp booster, but not after that, don&#039;t want to have those levels all over the place before rolling. I don&#039;t know if its more psychological at this point, but I always seem to feel better with the booster taken in advance like that. <br /><br />The week of I make sure to stick to my regular workout schedule and eat really lean. Lost of veggies, lots of fruits, absolutely no fast food or garbage (I’m a health nut and exercise freak anyway). Always make sure you get good sleep the night before because the first night will set your pace and you don’t want to be limping into day 3.<br /><br />Day 1 I usually will roll with 125mg of moonrocks with a 50mg booster about +2/2.5 hours into it. That will usually last me all the way back to the hotel and I tend to sleep like a baby on the come down.<br /><br />When you get up make sure you stick to that healthy food choice and rest. <br /><br />Day 2 I try to mix it up a bit. I’ll usually take about 75mg of mdma and break up an 1/8 of shrooms throughout the night to keep the trippiness going. I actually did that while riding the ferris wheel last year. Fucking amazing ride that was. <br /><br />At the end of day 2 I usually cheat a bit. If you are going to Vegas EDC then there is a raver hotel that is NOT widely known by tourists, but if you ask around some nice locals or even EDCers will be able to point you to the right direction. The beautiful thing about this hotel is there usually is a part time RN that works there and her mission in life seems to be to take care of ravers (she actually had a brother who died from being given heroin instead of mdma, so she is on a mission to work with the local community to educate on proper drug use). If you’re nice to her and listen to her give a small lecture on proper usage, you usually can get a nice IV from her to replenish your hydration levels. Hell, if you’re lucky you’ll probably run into me there too!<br /><br />Day 3 is our be all end all day. We go hard and out body knows it, so make sure you rest all day. The heavy headliners will be closing out the main stage and you will see some insane shit that night. I usually won’t take more than 200mg and that will take me to wonderland until I get home the next day. <br /><br />Meet people, enjoy the atmosphere, and make sure you stay in touch with the friends and family you make. I have a pretty good festival family and we have made it to the last few EDS, Coachella, Ultra, electric zoo, nocturnals, and this year we are adding burning man to that list. The family I’ve met at these places are some of the coolest, most diverse, and realest people I know. <br /><br />Enjoy yourself and be safe. <br /><br />Another suggestion would be to go out one weekend and take a bit of a higher dosage than you usually take just to see how your body will react. To prep for the first festival I did 300mg in one night just to see how my body would react to that much stimulant in me. It was a wild fucking night. That is a small gauge as to what to expect. <br /><br />I’ve been doing MDMA on and off for about 10 years now and it never gets old. Just be safe and happy rolling.<br />
