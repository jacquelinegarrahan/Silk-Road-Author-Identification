				I was at a concert last summer. A couple guys sold me &#039;doses.&#039; But it wasn&#039;t L. I liked it, but don&#039;t know what it was. This is what it was like. Very calm. The hallucinating sky eased it&#039;s way in and was very visual. I felt calm and at peace, not electric like L. I noticed my heaviest hallucinations we when my eyes were closed, like a whole psychedelic world was behind closed eye lids. It was on a blotter, but didn&#039;t look like L blotter. Any thoughts? I know all these research chemicals, but really don&#039;t know them well. It lasted 8 hours and was a very pleasant trip. Any thoughts on what might have been on lot?

				It might have been an unusual looking lsd blotter. <br /><br />Then again, at festivals you get people selling all kinds of crazy things. One of the funnier ones i heard of is people psuhing 50 mg valium tablets as xtc. Obviously these have the exact opposite effect of what the buyer expects, but they do allow the vendor to take off before any of their conned customers regain the ability to complain :D

				nah it was something good. this was a hard core hippie with the goods. i totally trust him and the shit was psychedelic. i said what was it, he said doses, i said what was it like and he said it was very clean. i may never know, but if there is a mild psychedelic research chemical i might want to try it out in a decent setting. well anyway, what would anyone suggest as a mild lsd-esque research chemical. i really don&#039;t know them but love to trip and i have not found any good L on here.

				25i-NBOMe is a great psychedelic that is &quot;similar&quot; in effects of LSD but the blotters are bitter and have to be taken bucally (I can&#039;t spell that word for shit, My apologizes)
