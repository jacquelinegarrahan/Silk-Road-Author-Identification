				i am a regular opiate user and have mainly used hydrocodones and the occasional oxy when i can get a hold of them.&nbsp; i have recently acquired a few of the 80 mg new and old formulas.&nbsp; can someone please give me a step by step process on how to prepare and snort each type of pill.&nbsp; thanks fellow opiophiles!&nbsp; look forward to hearing your responses.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />----bird

				The old ones are easy.&nbsp; Crush them under a bill and crush them into the finest powder possible.&nbsp; Line em out and enjoy.<br />The new ones as best i can tell are impossible.&nbsp; If someone else has an answer for the new ones i would love to hear it, but i don&#039;t think it can be done.<br />

				This is sort of a guess as I&#039;ve never tried it. But, you could attempt to freeze it in liquid nitrogen or towards absolute zero. Either this will separate the compounds as the polymer attempts to form the most thermodynamically favorable crystal lattice or will at least make it extremely brittle I would think. I&#039;m not really sure how the oxy and the ammonio methacrylate polymer interact whether there is a interaction with the quaternary ammonio groups and metal hydroxides bound to the oxy or whether the powder is just sort of loosely in cased in plastic. I hear alot of people just trying to microwave and chop it up. Polymers are typically degraded thermally and are more likely to have water trapped in it than the oxy. Perhaps this method of fusing the pill is right for you.

				You should just chew dem shits, especially OP that shit is rubber. Chewing them is pretty rad man, you can chew em a bit and still get a lot of the XR (will last like 6-8 hours instead of 12 if you just swallowed or 3-4 with instant release) and still hits you harrd. Bioavailability of oxy is 90% oral and only like 65% intranasal, fyi.&nbsp; I have had my best oxy experiences when I have chewed a half an OP or something, and I blow blues fairly often. Especially if you got a long day of school or work, da bomb...

				for the op best is oral, cut into smaller pieces with a SHARP razor then soak in a highly acidic drink (sodas, orange juice, lemonade) for a couple hours to break down the polymer and release the oxy into solution. <br /><br />very difficult to snort - must powder using hose clamp, pedi-egg, dremel, even sandpaper works... it must be extremely fine, and then spread onto plate in a single layer, each tiny piece must be touch the plate, if the layer is too think or pieces too large it wont work. heat plate in microwave up to 10 min or more sometimes until the plastic clearly melts and the color changes to an amber brown... but stop before it turns dark dark brown and burns. then let cool, the brown goo is still slightly sticky but if done correctly can be scraped into lines with a razor and snorted. not as potent as the OC though (remove the outer coating by using some spit and a paper towel before crushing the OC)

				you can get addicted to the act of snorting, and if so then taking it orally just wont satisfy the urge but you obviously dont understand.<br /><br />i personally wont do all that shit but they asked so i answered. i honestly wouldnt only chew it especially though - you dont liberate the oxy from the polymer matrix. the clinical trials demonstrate a substantial portion isnt even released and it takes a few hours to reach peak plasma conc

				by breaking down the matrix before ingesting you are able to absorb the drug instantly. especially in an acidic drink the whole thing hits much more quickly - and the more rapidly the drug is delivered the more pronounced the effects. by just chewing up the pill the drug makes it to your brain in much lower amounts and you start breaking down the dose before youve even absorbed half of it - not very effective for getting high or being economical

It is both.&nbsp; I have insufflated a shit ton of oxy, and I do agree with what you say about getting addicted to certain ROAs, but I&#039;m just saying chewing OPs does get you high and is very economical cause it lasts practically the whole fuckin day. Its much more economical than sniffing in fact. The bioavailability is also much higher as I mentioned. That other stuff you said is inconsequential; sniffing is fun but its not more efficient like you might think it is, but whatever if thats what you wana do, fine. But if you have OPs, good luck with that grueling science experiment you could just chew and be buzzin/pain free for 8 hours instead of 3....

				what you quoted doesnt even mention snorting, it mentions taking it orally - it was directly comparing you chewing the op to the suggestion of cutting into chunks and soaking in an acidic solution to first break down the polymer. if you dont, then you are wasting up to a third of the oxycodone because it remains in the goop in your stomach. therefore it is less economical. <br /><br />it wont last as long because you are absorbing all the chem faster but you could still just drink half the solution and save the other half for six hours later and you are getting more out of the single pill. thats why it is more economical. <br /><br />you absorbing the drug quicker results in higher plasma concentrations causing more to cross the blood brain barrier - more oxy reaching the receptors means you get more high. if you know about pharmacology it is definitely not &quot;inconsequential&quot; <br /><br />i agree snorting has a lower bio-ava then oral, so if you want the most out of oxy you shouldnt insufflate either. i already said i dont use the method, but you want to argue with me...&nbsp; i was just answering the question that was asked since multiple people expressed interest. <br />&nbsp;<br />i too would stress the potential addictive risk of oxy.&nbsp; i think it is definitely under estimated, i know it was by me - oxy is what got me addicted to opiates and even heroin is suprisingly not even as enjoyable a high in many ways... just that oxy is too damn expensive so H is my preference now usually.&nbsp; all the stigma of H should be placed on oxy as well - yet some dont realize the danger because it is a pharm

				the proper way... whats so different about the method MM already posted that you felt it necessary to reiterate. maybe i missed something but reposting your link doesnt really contribute much. many people wont even click on clearnet links...<br /><br />at least take the time to actually post the method and point out the differences from what was already mentioned
