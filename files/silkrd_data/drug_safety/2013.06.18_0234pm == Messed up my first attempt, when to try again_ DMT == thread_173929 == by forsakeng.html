				My original method of trying to smoke DMT didn&#039;t work too great. I got a numb tongue and lips and some heavy breathing so chances are I burnt a good bit of it. Since then i&#039;ve made a little vape pipe out of a lightbulb to try again. Given that my goal is to aim for a breakthrough is there a set time on when best to try again? I&#039;ve read there is an instant tolerance to DMT after taking it for a short period of time but I&#039;ve no idea if this is true or is applicable to me given that it wasn&#039;t a successful trip.<br /><br />thanks!

				DMT tolerance varies from individual to individual but usually if you wait more than an hour you are read to go again.<br /><br />I suggest you to build the machine instead of going with a lightbulb. It&#039;s fine also a lightbulb but the machine works better and it&#039;s very easy to do (whatever small bottle will do, as a mini-alchol one or tabasco sauce one). If you want to waste as little as possible and have a breakthrough the machine is the best (of the free methods). That or the key which is also very good (some say even better; I never tried but theoretically it should because it is very near in functioning to a GVG).<br /><br />Simply google the terms. Both are easy to do and require very little money to build.

				thanks man, i&#039;ll definitely be taking a shot at building The Machine. I cut my fingers to shreds building that light bulb pipe and it doesn&#039;t sound as nearly effective
