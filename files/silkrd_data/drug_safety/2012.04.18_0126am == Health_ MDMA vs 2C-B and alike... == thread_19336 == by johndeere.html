				Hello,<br /><br />One should take MDMA once every 4 weeks for it to be almost harmless. What about 2C-B? My brain must stay healthy.<br />Someone suggested Mephedrone but erowid says it&#039;s no good for health, so it&#039;s out of the equation.

				I&#039;ve heard that 2c-b is much easier on the body than MDMA. I don&#039;t know how often someone could take it before it was a hazard to health though. I&#039;d say just treat it like MDMA and don&#039;t over do it. Besides, the less often you take a drug the more pleasurable it is when you do it.

				Where 2C-B is still classified as a RC (research chemical) there isn&#039;t awhole lot known about them.<br />They were discovered around 2003, I think, and only time will tell what the side effects (if any are).<br /><br />A study out of Harvard found no long term neurotoxic side effects from pure MDMA;<br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/19/ecstasy-harm-brain-new-study<br />http://www.addictionjournal.org/viewpressrelease.asp?pr=147<br /><br />So in my opinion MDMA is the way to go.

However, it was made in 1974 I think by Alexander Shulgin. So it has actually been around for longer than everyone thinks. I&#039;ve forgotten the exact date, but I think it was 1974. <br /><br />I do agree about the nausea, especially during come up... I once snorted it (very foolish thing to do as it stings like a motherfucker) and actually vomited during come up. Administrating 2c-b orally is the best way... And take a low dose to begin with. This may decrease the intense nausea during come up. I do still snort 2c-b but that&#039;s when I combine it with MDMA (they go very well together) and the mdma dulls the sting. The nausea is less intense when you have mdma in your system... well for me it was, but then again others may disagree.<br /><br />2c-b didn&#039;t do much for me neither. Some mild visual and mild euphoria is about all it did for me. I did however experience intense emotions, it&#039;s certainly an emotional trip... well for me at least. With MDMA its magical... I enjoy a lot of drugs more when I&#039;m on mdma, I&#039;m not encouraging people to do lots and lots combos... Always read up on different combos when/if you think about trying them. Harm reduction is what this forum is about... We&#039;re teaching them politicians that people can have the intellect to do drugs safely.

				2C-B vs. MDMA is a little bit like comparing apples to oranges.&nbsp; 2C-B is classed as a psychedelic, whereas MDMA is generally considered an &quot;empathogen.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re different beasts, even if they are both based on the phenethylamine structure.

MDMA is what it is, a lovely fantastic feeling chemical. 2c-b is a real psychedelic, with visuals and the like. I do not experience visuals of any kind on MDMA, just the empathogenic feelings I love.

				MDMA and 2c-b are remarkably similiar if you ask me. Never done LSD, but I&#039;ve done shrooms and they&#039;re not alike AT ALL. On the other hand 2c-b does give you that &quot;i&#039;ve got a bunch of serotonin running through me&quot; feeling that MDMA and starting an antidepressant has.
