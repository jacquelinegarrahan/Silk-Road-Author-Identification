				Title: <strong>LSD and HPPD</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I have not tried LSD yet but I am very curious. I was going to buy some but the vendor is out of stock at the moment. While I was reading more about it I came across something called HPPD. In short, this is like visuals remaining long after the trip has finished, except you know they aren&#039;t reality. I read severe cases where you must visit a doctor occur only 1%-5% of the time in first time users (usually people prone to it in their genetics or something) but there are suspected many more cases where the person does not seek help. I also read about an experiment involving regular people, LSD users, and people who used LSD and have HPPD and there are certain vision aspects that worsen down the line. Such as the ability to tell if a light is flickering or constant (like a strobe light). Regular people could tell it was still flickering while at a very high speed, LSD users in the middle, and HPPD patients the worst. LSD is supposedly not harmful physically unless you do something to yourself while tripping so what I&#039;m trying to determine is why the LSD users would be any less than the regular people. Potential damage to eyesight plus possibility of HPPD (which would drive me absolutely insane) are making me have reserves about trying LSD despite the fact that I&#039;m still very curious. Is there any real risk of developing long lasting changes like these?

				HPPD is always a risk with psychedelics, if you don&#039;t want HPPD, then it&#039;s simple. Don&#039;t take psychedelics.<br /><br />~O.S.

				I have HPPD from taking 300+ LSD trips. It didn&#039;t happen suddenly, but rather gradually and slowly. I ignored many warning signs my body was sending me to end up with this condition.<br /><br />I have heard of some people developing HPPD from a single trip, so it is possible. However, its way more common in heavy users. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a good resource on HPPD:<br />www.hppdonline.com (clearnet, duh)<br /><br />Again, as O.S. said above, the only sure fire way to avoid HPPD is to not take psychedelics.<br /><br />On a positive note, I don&#039;t mind the visual disturbances of the HPPD at all. I find them rather enjoyable most of the time, and I don&#039;t regret taking all that acid. In fact I still take it ;)

				I recall having visuals few days after a very intense trip! It was actually pretty cool i have to admit like &#039;free trippin&#039;&nbsp; lol. But after a week or so it was over :)

				1%-5% of first time users must visit a doctor?&nbsp; That can&#039;t be right.<br /><br />Many millions of people have taken LSD and yet hardly anyone needs to see a doctor after.<br /><br />That&#039;s interesting that HPPD users were the worst at noticing flickering the least.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken psychedelics a couple of dozen times and feel like I now sometimes notice flicking that isn&#039;t really there, but that&#039;s the opposite effect.<br /><br />I noticed visual disturbances long before ever taking a psychedelic though.<br /><br />If you&#039;re paranoid then don&#039;t use LSD.&nbsp; Well worth the risk to me though.

				I think the risk of significant long-term problems from occasional LSD use is extremely low but there isn&#039;t any way to prove it either way.

If the symptoms go away, then what you had was residuals from the trip, not HPPD. <br /><br />Regarding reading - sometimes I find reading to be difficult due to HPPD. Sometimes I&#039;m trying to read and the words on the page will just look like alphabet soup. Other times it&#039;ll appear as if random lines have been highlighted in neon yellow or orange. I can usually look away and make it stop, but sometimes I just have to stop reading. It can be distracting for sure.<br /><br />Again, its not all bad. Sometimes when I&#039;m bored I can just conjure up some visuals and trip out staring at the carpet. Wheeeee! ;D<br /><br />But if you don&#039;t want to risk developing HPPD, just don&#039;t take LSD.

				usually lsd will awaken a pre mental disorder that existed in your body usually transfer through genetics and they will come up sooner or later regardless of the drug it self.<br /><br />Many people have taken acid and on the right proportion is totally safe drug in my opinion.
