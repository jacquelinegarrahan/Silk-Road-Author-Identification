				I see recommendations for Ketamine dosages, but how do you account for purity?<br /><br />For example if you want a 100mg dose and the purity is tested at 85%, should that be taken into account?<br />

				Ok I gotta ask an ignorant question here - how would I use &quot;bumps&quot; to do that?<br /><br />You mean just small increments until you feel it?<br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten a hold of a 1/64th teaspoon measuring spoon (it&#039;s small) and it seems like that holds around 80mg.&nbsp; I could probably fill that half way...<br /><br />

				First time I tried K I actually weighed out 1 &quot;dose&quot; as listed on Erowid for a light<br />experience, just to see what it did and how I liked it.&nbsp; Next thing I know, 30 mins<br />later, I just dumped a bit out, crushed it up good and pulled a small little sniff off<br />to the side.&nbsp; Did that, checked out how it made me feel and kept taking little lines<br />like that.

				I did not stay with the light experience.&nbsp; The light experience made me realize that I enjoyed what it<br />was going to do to/for me, so I ditched the measuring thing and took other friends&#039; advice, by just <br />laying out some K and doing little lines of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s cool because it doesn&#039;t last too long so you can<br />really gauge how fucked up you are going to get yourself.&nbsp; Just be aware that it takes about 5-15<br />mins to really kick in.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only &quot;truly&quot; K holed once and that was because my bag was almost empty and I was already<br />really fucked up on it so I said fuck it and lined the rest up and just went.&nbsp; That was rather scary<br />I&#039;ll be honest.&nbsp; But it&#039;s something to check out.&nbsp; And I say &quot;truly&quot; K holed because there were <br />numerous other times where I was sitting in a pitch black room, but seeing out of the corner of<br />my eyes what appears to be bright outdoor scenery.&nbsp; Or sitting in a chair looking at my laptop<br />and the rest of the room that I&#039;m not looking directly at is twisting and turning completely <br />upside down.&nbsp; It&#039;s some crazy shit.&nbsp; You can get very confused if you do a lot of it.&nbsp; But also<br />don&#039;t be intimidated by it.&nbsp; Just take it slow and feel it out.<br /><br />The best way to describe what it feels like, in my opinion, when you do a more moderate dose<br />(aka - not getting to the confusion/world upside down/almost k holing) is like having the <br />coordination of being drunk (be careful at the top of stairs, for real), but a sort of serene mindset.<br />Personally it makes me want to dance a lot, and I do.&nbsp; It also is an anesthetic, and I do notice<br />those qualities.&nbsp; Things can go numb.&nbsp; You&#039;ll know when you&#039;re going deep because I start to<br />notice my &quot;soul/thoughts&quot; beginning to feel like they could separate from my body.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very<br />different type of feeling and one that makes me think about death, sometimes.&nbsp; I know I&#039;m not<br />dying but it can really make you think about what it will be like when the time comes....<br /><br />Hopefully that helps, and the &quot;death&quot; comment didn&#039;t turn you off too much.&nbsp; That&#039;s likely just<br />a &quot;me&quot; thing.

				Back in my day, we would measure them with gel-caps.&nbsp; The really small gel-caps were about 50mg when 3/4 filled, maybe 60mg filed. The larger ones were about 150 3/4 filled, maybe 200 full.&nbsp; So for $20 you would get two little ones or 3/4 of one big one.&nbsp; The first time that I got it, these hippies were in a car and just pulled up &quot;Wanna try K?&quot; so I was like &quot;Fuck yeah, I&#039;ll take 3 20s&quot; and that was the best K that I&#039;d ever had.&nbsp; I did a 1&quot; line off of a skateboard behind a Church, and the first thing that came to mind, was that my Brain was on a space shuttle, and it was leaving Earth! a night of k-drunk debauchery ensued.&nbsp; I&#039;d say start with HALF of what you would do with GOOD coke.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don&#039;t do coke, start with 1/2 of what a 100mg pill looks like crushed. or measure it out with a half-gelcap.&nbsp; &nbsp;50mg should make it difficult to walk.&nbsp; 100-150 will make it hard to think.&nbsp; 180-200 will make it hard to do anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;We were doing Ketaset(sp) so I know there is salt in the bottles and it&#039;s not 100% pure, but close.&nbsp; Hope that helps!

				I would say for your first time take a 30-50mg bump. I agree a car key is good to use when out of the home, but I dont think it gives you 50mg, I think less than half that. Try a thin half inch line, wait 20 mins, then increase appropriately.<br />I once did too big of a rail and completely forgot who I was for a good ten mins (not so good when your supposed to be partying!)

				I can&#039;t wait to try it. I have been reading about it here and at erowid where it refers to it as cat tranquilizer lol&nbsp; ;D.<br /><br />I am supposed to have some coming from a new vendor so I&#039;ll be able to add it to my resume. I was reading about the &quot;k-hole&quot; thing and thought &quot;wow&quot;. So if I get 100 mgs then maybe I shouldn&#039;t just do it all at once. Any thoughts? <br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely be writing my experience in that vendors thread as well as any K threads

				i have a 20mg scoop...just did a bump...in about 5 mins i started getting the drip and feeling nice and floaty...try 20mg up each nostril and see how you like it...<br /><br />if you wanna K-hole you&#039;re gonna have to go over 100mg...not sure if you&#039;re gonna enjoy the drip though...most people that go for the K-hole go intramuscular with it...

				<br />Yeah, 100mg shld get you to k-hole effects, if you do it all at once. What attarcted me to k was a trip report---some guy speaking of his multiple egos fracturing off into space and having conversations with each other. When he came back he was a humbled man, sounded therapeutic for this day and age.

				if you are trying to get a specific dosage, those listed assume nearly pure K... so if you know yours is 85 percent pure, then multiple whatever dosage you are aiming for, say 100 mg, and divide by .85 for the amount of your batch to do<br /><br />so if you want a dose of 100 mg, then you need to do about 118 mg (100/0.85 = 117.6 mg)<br /><br />i agree though for your first time especially it would be smart to start with small bumps and work your way up&nbsp; <br /><br />K is one unusual drug and the experience will be unlike anything else you have ever tried (unless youve done mxe, etc)

				with me being new to it I&#039;ll definitely take it easy as I don&#039;t yet know how it will effect me Plus I want to see exactly what comes first but I&#039;ll probably start off with 20 or 30 mgs.

				About an hour if your snorting it, which is what I assume your doing. After effects extend an hour after that.<br /><br />As for FYIs, what are you hoping to get out of K? Are you looking to K hole or club on it?<br />Like its already been said; start small.<br /><br />Sniff a bead of water to dull and pain from snorting (Be prepared for your nose to run if you take 100mg-150mg.<br /><br />If you take a high dose like 150mg you will not only get CEVs but some unusual OEVs so be prepared for that;<br />(Eg...You dont see patterns on surfaces like LSD...but then all of a sudden your door is moving towards you and the roof falls in on you)

				very strange drug indeed - only done it three times so no expert but thinking about getting some more soon&nbsp; :D<br /><br />1st time ordered 500mg&nbsp; - started off eyeballing small lines. kind off hard to explain but was lying watching/listening to Nirvana unplugged on youtube and at points almost felt like i was in the same room as Kurt&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; kinda cool like feeling relaxed but fucked up at the same time. as the evening progressed i got more adventurous and eventually k holed&nbsp; :o this was seriously fucked up. remember feeling like I had died and this was because I had a brain tumor that i was able to see in my head!&nbsp; :o very schizophrenic and confusing. the good thing is that it only lasts a short time before reality begins to return. After k holing I come to reality on my knees crouched over the sofa so be careful if doing on your own. No candles or shit like that incase you knock something over. Pretty scary and not exactly what I like for a evenings entertainment but something that has to be experienced.<br /><br />done it another few times and another warning - one time had 4 or 5 pints before and was sick in the sink&nbsp; :-[ DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL <br /><br />As I say its a once a year type of thing for me but that time might be close lol

				When I first made lines with ket I made them like coke lines. My friend promptly told me off and made each into about 3 baby lines. Now I mainly use a key until I got my nifty little spoon necklace. I do two or three key bumps at a time every half an hour or so. I&#039;ve never k-holed though I&#039;ve come close. I think the mandy keeps me too grounded.<br /><br />K can be an amazing sit around party drug or club drug if you&#039;re doing bumps. Be prepared to run into a lot of people. Also, things are really really strange on it. Like incomprehensible. Once I looked into a mirror and then told everyone none of us were people. I&#039;ve always had a hard time recognising things, like an ashtray on a crowded table, etc. Have fun!

				right, so some of the members of the ILF are on K now.<br /><br />~~K is such a multi-faceted drug, truly like a prism.&nbsp; one day you do the Keta, and you&#039;re lying on your bed floating in ambient waves of bliss, watching the universe new age on by.&nbsp; another day you do K, you&#039;re in a filthy bar surrounded by lecherous drunks&nbsp; but you don&#039;t mind because you&#039;re curled up on a couch in front of the speakers, laughing hysterically at everything and at nothing.&nbsp; another day you visit the kittens, you&#039;re seeing the history of the Middle East unfold before your eyes, which you can&#039;t determine are open or closed.&nbsp; One time, i did K after slamming two drinks.&nbsp; i don&#039;t really drink, like at all, so i was pretty drunk off of said liquor, and though i insufflated that lovely ketamina...<br /><br />another member must interject ~~ please be careful combining alcohol and k, especially liquor before k (never sicker)!&nbsp; people seem to have different reactions here -- YMMV and all that -- and no matter what your particular brain chemistry, you might get away with a drink or two before taking in the world&#039;s greatest anesthetic ... but get drunk and do a significant line and you might find yourself out of your body while projectile vomiting, leaking out the other end, and being crippled by some of the most painful nausea you&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; It seems they are &quot;synergistic,&quot; but not in a way you might find pleasant.<br /><br />Pro tips for increasing bio-availability if you are railing it ... crush the crystal very finely.&nbsp; Also, using a bullet -- the kind packed with drug powder, not gun powder, i.e. the kind that people usually buy so they can do coke surreptitiously in a club -- might give you more than a little bump, but it also seems to get the K sprayed all over the nose for maximum absorption...ok i&#039;m being told I have to pass the mic to another member of the ILF.<br /><br />~~so anyways, like i was saying, after the firewater which I normally eschew, an hour later, i do my K-friend, and it&#039;s super spacey and fun UNTIL i fall on the floor with terrible nausea ~~<br /><br />anyways ~~ lol gone into k-space -- but luckily not drunk! -- so now I&#039;ll take over ~~ whatever you think K is, it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; I like that it can drudge up really ugly shit from the unconscious so that you can really acknowledge and deal with the thought instead of trying to pretend like it&#039;s not there as you have been for God knows how long.&nbsp; This scared me when I first started using it.&nbsp; It&#039;s the greatest thing, I think, since pressed pills (sliced bread), lol.&nbsp; It&#039;s a different path from E, in that you can kinda see how other people are in you and you are in others but in a dissociative sort of way, not in a cuddle-puddle sort of way.&nbsp; And yeah, the liberation from emotions can be ecstatic!&nbsp; Or you can think it&#039;s cold.&nbsp; My guess is that intellectuals like K but another member of the ILF is trying to get in here so ....<br /><br />the advice on doing small bumps until you like where you are is pretty sound.&nbsp; if you want to go for a particular experience, though, measure it out, but again, who knows, because with 125mg railed one person might be in the hole while another might just be chilling in alternity.&nbsp; Also check out John Lilly!

				Alcohol and ketamine being a bad combo is a good thing to point out, since alcohol usage is fairly ubiquitous.&nbsp; I can attest to<br />how terrible the combo is as well.<br /><br />I had known ahead of time that K and alcohol was alleged to be a bad combo, but I thought it was more about in case you K<br />hole and are drunk and start to puke, you could easily die.&nbsp; And I knew I wasn&#039;t going to K hole so I figured I&#039;d be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not so!&nbsp; It really amplifies the effects of the K (and the alcohol I guess) but not in the fun way.&nbsp; More in the way of amplifying<br />the shittier aspects that both drugs have.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do it and find out.&nbsp; Keep in mind though that I was totally wasted and did a lot<br />more K than I actually intended too, but still, it was miserable and I don&#039;t fuck around like that anymore.&nbsp; Lesson learned

				Just got half a gram of special K.<br /><br />Am I right to just cap 2 capsules at 50mg each, drop one and see how it goes? (prefer not to snort) and drop the next if I like it?<br /><br />Cheers

Much more is needed 2.) The effects will take longer to kick in, longer duration, will not peak as hard, etc.<br /><br />So as 50mg insulfated is a fair beginner dose for oral I would suggest 2.5 times that (so 125mg) <br />If you want to be safe, round it down to 100mg<br /><br />You say you prefer not to snort but very very few people do K orally so there must be some good reasons for that. I suggest looking on erowid for reports.<br /><br />I dont like putting K up my nose either, so to hole, I IM it.
