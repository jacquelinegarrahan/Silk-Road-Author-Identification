				Considerations:<br />1. Can MDMA be in water that is not distilled?<br />2. Will bottled water have traces of chlorine or other harmful chemicals in it?<br />3. If shaken, will the solution have even concentrations?<br />4. Obviously I will not be using this water bottle awfully quickly, and MDMA out of solution is okay, but how long can mdma in solution last? Please note; chlorine and other things can harm MDMA&gt;&gt;<br />5. So considering all of the above, what brand of bottled water or what drink can I use to store mdma?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Plastic bottle may harm the mdma if bottle gets hot accidentally or is stored too long<br /><br />------ no chlorine<br />------

				For all the chem geeks:<br />What I dissolve it in needs to have none of these in it:<br />-Acids<br />-Acid Chlorides<br />-Acid Anhydrides<br />-Oxidizing Agents<br />-Reducing Agents<br />-Alkali Metals<br />.<br />Does pure h20 contain none of these? I dont know what bottled water brands will work

				Yeah, and it is risky.

				I think bottled water is pretty much free of all that stuff you listed. Why don&#039;t you just hide it in a safe place? Putting it in water is going to make it harder to dose and with that amount you might not dissolve it all. Walking around with a cloudy bottle of water is more obvious than having 4wraps in your pocket or down ur trousers.

				Distill water and store it in a sealed glass container, cover the glass container with something to protect it from sunlight and heat. Doesn&#039;t have to be too crazy, there&#039;s just no need to expose it to sunlight when you could avoid that.

				Side note, could this work with other drinks or would certain chemicals destroy it? Perhaps a can of Red Bull maybe? Or just a regular soda? Would that work? I think it would help mask the taste somewhat.

				I&#039;ve heard having acidic substances in your stomache while ingesting mdma is counterproductive and harms the bioavailibility to some extent, so id avoid a lot of things based on that.<br />However I did get bottled distilled water and will find a non-plastic replacement container I think.<br /><br />P.s. the purpose is for use at home/out and about but not at clubs/concerts/venues. It is simply so it is not so damned worrisome to have on me.<br /><br />Hmm. A drink other than water... I wanted to use monster with a twist on/off cap but I think carbonation can hurt the mdma.<br />As crazy as this sounds I wonder if milk would work...<br /><br />@Mashman: Im going to have it in a bottle that is not see through. I will do a calculation based on the fluid ounces and measure it in specific volumetric doses after shaking well. I am very tolerant when it comes to drugs, and have done over a gram in a night, and almost a gram in one line before. I figure if I accidentally underdose it will be fine, and if I accidentally dose higher than intended previous experience suggests I will be fine too.<br /><br />Again, its not for clubs or anything, I just have a lot of heat on me police wise, and have been searched 4 or 5 times before in my life. I wouldnt be terribly suprised if they came and visited and searched. I would prefer to have it invisible.<br /><br />I am considering cutting a small hole in a jacket and sliding it inside, any suggestions in the ultimate way to hide a bag (4g is about the size of a pinky i think) in average every day things is welcome.

Dunno how the carbonation would effect it) to absorb it. I think. It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve studied any chemistry so someone please correct me if I&#039;m mistaken, but I believe I&#039;m correct here.

				I checked up on bluelight and everyone says no basic liquids such as milk or milk based drinks, most people just recommend a glass of coca-cola because it&#039;s slightly acidic, so I&#039;m guessing carbonation doesn&#039;t affect it too much, if at all.

				I see. I thought I had read not to mix it with CO or CO2 somewhere, but I can not remember the reference. I believe that is carbonation.<br />I have my doubts as to the purity of distilled water in pharmacies, I would prefer to get it straight out of a college lab. <br />This is a strange issue to tackle. as most people who dissolve in liquid drink immediately. <br />Is it true that MDMA is imported in wine and then brought out of solution? If so, this would be a nice way to do it. Although it is illegal for me to possess alcohol and might end in me pouring it down the drain.

				I see you posted in the &quot;Commotion Potion&quot; thread, he appears to be having excellent results in real-time. I guess the carbonation from the Red Bull didn&#039;t affect it much. Also, I&#039;ve heard alcohol absorbs MDMA very well, so that would be interesting to try. I&#039;m assuming anything left behind (any sludge on the sides/bottom of the bottle) would be filler that didn&#039;t get absorbed, so you&#039;d be getting pure MDMA unless it&#039;s cut with something else that absorbs with whatever you&#039;ve put it in.

				Yes :) I jumped right on that thread.<br />Right, I am convinced a quick mix and drink works very well. <br />There remains the question of trace chorine/chlorides/acids/Oxidizing agents/Reduxing Agents/ Alkali metals and how quickly they will degrade MDMA. It is likely atleast one of these things will be present in some form for most solutions, except &#039;exceptionally&#039; distilled water. <br />I read a thread on a different site that said distilled water is intentionally polluted by the gov&#039;t so people making silver can&#039;t do it to 100% purity or something along those lines, the reason I am not linking or remembering exactly is the sight also discussed illuminati and many government conspirisy theories that seem a little crazy.

				Yeah that sounds a little absurd because most people could just make their own distilled water and you still could never technically get 100% pure anything. Always gonna have traces of something somewhere. Luckily it&#039;s not hard to distill water to professional lab-grade quality.
