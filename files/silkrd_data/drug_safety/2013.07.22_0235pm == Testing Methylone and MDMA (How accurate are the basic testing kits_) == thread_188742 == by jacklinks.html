				Basically I want to know how accurate test kits are. Let&#039;s assume you buy .2 of tiny crystals that is 50% MDMA and 50% Methylone. What type of reaction will a test kit show? Black or Yellow?

				it will show up as mdma, since methylone doesnt really react very well with the testing kits.<br /><br />But it depends, the ones i use are mandelin and marquis, and they dont react well with methylone. Or it doesnt react to a specific colour.<br /><br />Whereas the 50% mdma will still react and show the purple/black colour.. but probably just not as strong as an uncut mdma

				Thank You very much! I was asking this because I my friend tested a dose and said it reacted as MDMA but as an experienced user I noticed the taste was slightly off and it felt weaker than the purest stuff I&#039;ve bought off of here.<br /><br />
