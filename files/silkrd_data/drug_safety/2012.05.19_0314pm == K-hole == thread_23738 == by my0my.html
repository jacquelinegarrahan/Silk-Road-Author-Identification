				I&#039;m digging this up from the Ketamine/Depression thread in this forum:<br />Here&#039;s a helpful chart:<br />Insufflated / Nasal Ketamine Dosages<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by body weight&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;approx total<br />Threshold&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .1 mg / lb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 - 15 mg<br />Light&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .15 mg / lb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 - 30 mg<br />Common&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .3 mg / lb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30 - 75 mg<br />Strong&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.5 - .75 mg / lb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 - 125 mg<br />The K Hole&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 mg / lb&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 - 250 mg<br /><br />So I think I&#039;ve been bumping about 60 mg. I get about 15 bumps a gram. I go into a stellar head space that i would say is a k-hole....but have i really? I mean the dissociation and experience is incredible and i say i&#039;ve gotten into a k-hole because i am out. but according to this I&#039;d have to do 1/4 of the bag in one line. If done what the hell is coming assuming I&#039;ve been doing a common dose/heavy bump.

				I have used that info twice to dose for a K-hole and both times I just had strong dissociation, 150mg first then the next day 170mg. Both doses split into two lines done at the same time.<br />I find the k hole to be very shallow ever since I holed with MXE a few weeks prior to that, there was a 2 week gap between the two substances so I doubt its cross tolerance. It feels more like a metal tolerance to the feeling K produces. Also I should note I have actually never &#039;holed&#039; with K. I was probably expecting to much after MXE considering most say that K is better. Either way I ran out last night and don&#039;t plan on buying more. <br /><br />Try having 2 45mg lines after each other in different nostrils, or just bump sooner till you get to a &#039;hole&#039;<br /><br />Or<br /><br />Try some MXE&nbsp; 8)<br />

				I don&#039;t understand still, how can you K-hole after 150mg? All it gives me is the dizzy drunk feeling and obv all other ket effects, if you really want to k-hole, do it in the evening on a couch or something comfy, snort two 200mg lines, it will be a pain, and you will feel the effects almost immediately so make sure everything you need is ready next to you. Lay down, headphones or speakers and listen to music, feel yourself sinking in and trippin balls for the next hour, then an hour after that is a quite long comedown. Next day you will still feel a bit weird, as if having a mild hangover, but its worth it. Enjoy
