				I&#039;m attending a three day reggae festival and so far my stash consist of 250mg of MDMA and one 1mg blotter hit of 25b-nbome. <br /><br />Would be worth taking the 25b with the mdma or should I do them on separate days? <br /><br />Also has anyone here every combined MDMA with any other kind of&nbsp; LSD-mimic Psychedelic?

				i&#039;m not sure you would be able to do them on separate days. mdma and nbomes are cross tolerant. <br /><br />i haven&#039;t had a chance to flip with 25b but i imagine it would be a nice blend. mdma has a tendency to boost the affects of nbomes, at least according to the 25i flips i&#039;ve read. beware that taking a full dose might end up a lot stronger with mdma than by itself.

				I used to take a lot of MDMA and LSD but I find them incompatible. The headfuck is immense and you end up not really being able to enjoy one drug or the other.<br /><br />I never tried nbome, but if it is akin to LSD I wouldn&#039;t bother mixing it with MDMA.<br /><br />My choice would be to take the MDMA the first night then chill out and enjoy the LSD the second.

				Lol i honestly dont agree with anything thats been said here (no offense, really. opinions are opinions.)<br /><br />nbomes will still work after having taken mdma.<br /><br />I love actual candyflipping, you just need a SINGLE dose of both if you are going to combine them though (remember that)<br /><br />if i were you, i would take like 125 mgs of mdma the first night, and the second maybe take the rest of the md and the 25b together<br /><br />nbomes are pretty fucked at festivals though i wont lie to you. too much shit going on, definitely sensory overload.<br /><br />hope this helps.
