				I have just ordered a gram of mescaline from SR and am looking forward to trying it within the coming weeks. From what I&#039;ve heard, <br /><br />synthetic (powdered) mescaline can upset the stomach quite a bit when you ingest it, and can sometimes cause nausea and vomiting.<br /><br />Now, I have a very weak stomach, so much so that I can no longer eat magic mushrooms due to the fact that I start puking about 3 <br /><br />hours in and spend the rest of the night hovered over the toilet. I fear that mescaline will have the same effect on me. To combat<br /><br />this problem, I am hoping to get some empty gel capsules, put the powder inside, and take it that way, like a pill. My question is,<br /><br />where can you buy gel capsules? Can you find them at any local convenience store like walgreens or CVS? Are the simply called<br /><br />&quot;gel capsules&quot; or do they have a specific brand name? Would it seem sketchy to buy empty gel caps at a store? How much can you<br /><br />fit inside the average gel cap? I am hoping to take .5 of mescaline, so would that require more than one pill? Help would be<br /><br />appreciated<br /><br />

				There are a few vendors here on SR that sell empty gel caps, but in the past I have had decent luck with buying some melatonin from GNC in gelcap form and just dumping the melatonin powder out.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember exactly how big those were...they were kinda small..i was putting mdma powder into them and they worked out just fine for that purpose.<br />hope that helps!

				Yes, they are just called empty gel capsules. They have them at any Vitaminshoppe, or GNC..i personally order them bulk from ebay, you can 500 for the price of 100 if you order online. Im sure that aside the point though, as you will only need a few. I suggest getting size &#039;0&#039;, cause&nbsp; their big enough to weigh into, but not too big that its a bitch to swallow. Good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also contact futura, he has a sensitive stomach as well,. and does lots of mesc, he has a little formula hes devised to keep his tummy settled when on mesc. <br /><br />\EDIt, im not sure what 500mg mesc looks like, whether its dense or not, but i know that i put 200mg of MDxx in size 0&#039;s, and they arent even half way full.

				Putting mescaline in gelcaps will most likely only save you from tasting its extreme bitterness but it won&#039;t affect how nauseous or how upset your stomach would get. Mescaline and mushrooms induce nausea on a neurological level so your best bet is to take some anti-nausea thing like weed or even ginger. You shouldn&#039;t take the whole dosage all at once either.<br />You could just buy gelcaps on amazon but if don&#039;t want to be linked to such a purchase you can buy some a dietary supplements shop or buy some cheap meds that comes in capsules and empty them, as others stated.

				^what tree said... <br /><br />You can buy empty capsules at any health food or vitamin store - there&#039;s no need for stealth, empty caps are perfectly legal and tons of people buy them for thier own particular homebrew herbal concoctions.&nbsp; As a word of warning, stay away from Vegicaps.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a fable for you - someone had a very disruptive experience with Vegicaps and mdma. This person needed a new load of empty caps, bought a big bag of Vegicaps and loaded them up.&nbsp; The next month was spent on damage control since it turned out the Vegiecaps did not dissolve very fast - maybe 2x as long if you put them in water next to a regular cap.&nbsp; Very inferior roll off of super clean x unless you opened the cap before taking it, which sort of defeats the purpose, or put it up the butt. Speaking of which - if you have nausea problems, I STRONGLY recommend the later approach, although I can only vouch for mdma and foxy this way.<br /><br />

				Capping up Mesc to avoid Nausea is a bad idea and will actualy make the nausea worse cause the cap will dissolve against the lining of your stomach.<br /><br />Best way to take Mesc is to dissolve in Strong Coffee (with 2 or more Equal packs(Not sugar) to alleviate bitterness) and split dose.<br /><br />Take 1/2 dose...wait 1/2 hour than take second half. Caffeine potentiates Mesc...Thats why the strong coffee. <br /><br />Alternately if you can find Ginger Tea&nbsp; or even better Ginger/Mint Tea make a strong cup of that (5 or more tea bags with 2 or more equal packets) and dissolve mesc in that add few drops lemon oil and then split dose<br /><br />You also should take some Ginger, Mint or Lemon Oil about 1 hour before first dose. You can do all three if you can find a Mint-Ginger Tea and add lemon oil to it.<br /><br />I take 3-4 Datura Stramonium seeds 1/2 hour before as I have Chrones Disease and have to be real carefull with body load from Mesc or Shrooms. Some people dont think thats wise so if your not comfortable with that...split doses and the Ginger/Mint/Lemon Oil should really help!!<br /><br />Also I get bad nausea from eating fresh or dried Shrooms so I just do a cold water extraction on powdered shrooms as Shroom Cells are a real bitch to digest and thats what causes a lot of the Shroom Nausea...

				yea maybe i&#039;ll avoid the gel cap approach and try drinking that ginger tea stuff and putting the mesc in coffee. I don&#039;t&nbsp; get that much nausea from MDMA unless i&#039;m taking crystals, in which case i feel it&#039;s best to use gel caps for those. Damn those mdma crystals are bitter sometimes

Bitter as all get out(at least thhe D-Limo extracted,triple washed Mesc HCL I do...I have never tried the synthetic stuff)!! Thats why the Equal...<br /><br />I us two packets for 300mg, so if your taking 500mg I would use maybe 3 packets and maybe divide your dose into thirds...

Take it subling AKA in your mouth I KNOW it is awful but if you can hold it under your tongue and in your mouth for 20 mins give or take a little it will avoid that. Hold your saliva in your mouth and do not sallow till you just can&#039;t help it any more. ALSO brush your teeth first and use mouth wash .&nbsp; <br /><br />Alternatively do above but in smaller amounts for 5 to 10 mins at a time..&nbsp; till you take the amount that you wish to consume
