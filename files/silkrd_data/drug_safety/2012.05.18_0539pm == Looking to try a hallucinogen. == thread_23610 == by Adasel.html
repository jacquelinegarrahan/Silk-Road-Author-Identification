				Hey there.<br />I am reasonably new to this place and thought you guys are the best to ask for advice.<br />I have always wanted to try a hallucinogenic.&nbsp; Think about what the shamans use, Yaje, where they end up talking to animals etc.<br />This sounds silly i know, but is there anything out there that has this kind of effect?<br />I really do not know anything about hallucinogens per se, just the side effects they supposedly have.<br />Would be great to experience something like that, for just once in my life anyway.<br />Any help on this would be much appreciated.

				If it is your first trip, I would suggest shrooms.&nbsp; They are a lot more forgiving than most trips.&nbsp; If you want to go balls to the wall, then LSD is the way to go.&nbsp; 2CP will def get you there and last for a long time, but the nausea kills the fun.&nbsp; Bromo-dragonfly was also a good time but lasts ALL DAY so be prepared.<br /><br />I love me some good L and prefer that over everything but you might want to start small for your first time if you have never tripped before in case shit goes bad.&nbsp; Have some benzos handy either way.

				I started with shrooms and if I started outside I couldn&#039;t go in without going to a bad place.&nbsp; It messed with my sense of reality way more than, for example, a low dose of clean acid.<br /><br />An acid high (not tripping) is way easier to handle in my opinion. You can tell distinctly it&#039;s a powerful psychedelic, but I&#039;ve taken up to some 300-480 mcg (drops, unsure of quality but the range is definite) without going too far out. The most noticeable effect was I could understand words but not sentences when reading, aside from persistent euphoria.<br /><br />I advise low dose acid.

				I would suggest shrooms first if you want a trip, but if you&#039;ve never done any hallucinogens before an acid high is a kind place to start.<br /><br />I suppose it really does depend on how far you want to go out your first time. I&#039;ll also admit I&#039;ve developed a preference for acid over shrooms in general.

				Hallucinogens are an amazing class of drugs.<br /><br />Use them, value them, treasure them. They can be used to enlighten yourself or gain a new perspective on a problem or decision you need to make. <br /><br />The most famous and probably most commonly used hallucinogen is LSD. This is my personal favorite as well and I highly recommend it to anyone who desires to embark upon the psychedelic journey :).

				Best way to do it is go 400-500 micrograms of acid, or 50 mg of dmt. Honestly fuck shrooms, IMO when I eat them I feel poisoned and sick and its almost dark. LSD is so closely chemically related to seratonin your brain actually semi recognises it as seratonin thus giving you tons of happiness! I&#039;d suggest a mixture of 125-175 mg of MDMA with 400-500 micrograms of LSD for the full blown, amazing, euphoric, spiritual experience 8)

				I always advocate L, but I&#039;ll put my .02btc in and say if you get shrooms you can start small to kick it off and see if a shifting reality makes you mad...mad i say. Feeling good then usher in the trip based on that.

				Shrooms definitely sounds like the way to go.<br />My brother tried LSD when he was younger.&nbsp; His trip started out pretty well but after a bit, all he could see were spiders crawling over his body.<br />Fuck that shit.<br />Would be interesting for you guys to share bad experiences, then we might all be a bit better prepared for when the shit does hit the fan.<br />I have heard so many.&nbsp; One guy i knew thought Predator was swinging in the trees when he was walking home in the wee hours of the morning!

It is by far the kindest starting place, especially augmented with some 50-100mg of MDMA.<br /><br />Another option is a single toke of DMT. lasts some 5 minutes, it&#039;s very beautiful, and if you listen carefully you might understand the auditory effects as language.

				shrooms are better than the synthetics.<br />i have shroomed a couple of times. acid tripped twice. looking back i should have only tried each once. it was good the first time for each trip, the second time i had an expectation for a great trip and was disappointed. <br /><br />be with good friends and have fun. don&#039;t get caught up in chasing the dragon, using hallucinogens is just not good for your brain and soul.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				My experience with mescaline has been so profound. It is such a gentle hallucinogen. Im surprised no one else is backing me on this one. Ive never heard of anyone having a bad trip on mesc. Its like combining MDMA and LSD-25. Ive done it a few times and have nothing but great things to say about it. I recommend every true psychonaught experience it at least once in their lifetime. You get the lovey dovey AHHHH feels good from mdma, with the breathing walls and awesome visuals of an acid trip. Its a perfect introduction to tripping with (IMO) no risks of the user having a &quot;bad trip&quot;. <br /><br />Mescaline- &quot;feels good man......&quot;

I suggest just looking it up; I can&#039;t explain it completely enough.<br /><br />The beginning of the wiki article:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of points whose boundary is a distinctive and easily recognizable two-dimensional fractal shape. The set is closely related to Julia sets (which include similarly complex shapes), and is named after the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it.<br />More precisely, the Mandelbrot set is the set of values of c in the complex plane for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the complex quadratic polynomial zn+1 = zn2 + c remains bounded.[1] That is, a complex number c is part of the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with z0 = 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of zn remains bounded however large n gets.<br />For example, letting c = 1 gives the sequence 0, 1, 2, 5, 26,…, which tends to infinity. As this sequence is unbounded, 1 is not an element of the Mandelbrot set. On the other hand, c = i (where i is defined as i2 = −1) gives the sequence 0, i, (−1 + i), −i, (−1 + i), −i, ..., which is bounded, and so i belongs to the Mandelbrot set.<br />Images of the Mandelbrot set display an elaborate boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications. The &quot;style&quot; of this repeating detail depends on the region of the set being examined. The set&#039;s boundary also incorporates smaller versions of the main shape, so the fractal property of self-similarity applies to the entire set, and not just to its parts.<br />The Mandelbrot set has become popular outside mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules, and is one of the best-known examples of mathematical visualization.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

What&#039;s interesting is that since I started seeing them in my trips I have less fear of spiders :)

It was very similar to MDMA, though the come-up was sharper and more physically stimulating, to the point that I couldn&#039;t sit still for long without moving to a new seat (130 mg). It generated excitement and made all sensations some degree of pleasant, but one thing I like about MDMA is the more calm euphoria, whereas the MDA was anything but calm.<br /><br />After the acid did come on, the MDA altered the point where I would normally turn inwards, and instead had me falling over and flailing about as I dove into the Mandelbrot set. It was extremely embarrassing afterwards, when I could reflect on my behavior, and I don&#039;t see myself ever choosing MDA over MDMA again.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even try to compare MDA to Ketamine. Even after re-associating with my body on K, it feels way different than MDA.

				i think lsd is the best psychedelic to start out with, as it is very flexible/more controlled. shrooms on the other hand, can get pretty weird and confusing... but i would definitely recommend a good dose of shrooms if you are seeking a transformative spiritual experience... also has immense healing power.

				with the effects of hallucinogens keep in mind that lots of people will tell you&nbsp; certain psychedelics or even strains of shrooms has especially euphoric/visual/XY qualities.. but the descriptions will vary widely as the quality of a trip is an extremely individual, set/setting dependent thing.<br />so my advice is to do your research on certain strains and drugs and settle with the one that seems to produce your most desired effect for most and still try not to expect it to be like that - you should have in mind that it can go completely different and idealy if it does you should avoid fighting it and just let go of your expectations. this is especially substantial to good experiences on higher doses.<br />in my opinion there are not many things that offer as much reward and peace as an intense psychedelic experience. you will learn a lot about yourself and the reality you live in&nbsp; :)<br /><br />have an interesting journey!<br /><br />ps - especially for the first time it might be very uncomfortable when the known laws begin to subside - you may find yourself trying to hold on to the state of conciousness you are used to. this is why for first experiences with lsd it is recommended to dose higher, which will make it easier to let go (or harder to hold on) ;)

				Well, since it&#039;s legal in my state, and I&#039;ve managed to actually grow (too well, I might add - I use a machete to get through my kitchen. Every day.) is Salvia divinorum. 5X or 10 X&nbsp; is best for newbies, 20 if you really like it, and the 40 X I couldn&#039;t remember a lot of it. The Really Strong Phase lasts about 5-6 minutes, and the resudual effect about 20-30 min. more. Then it stops. Additionally, it;s metaBOLITED HAVE ABOUT 30 MIN HALF-LIFE, AND IN 12 HRS. THERE ARE NONE LEFT IN YOUR BODY (SORRY cAPS lOCK ON, DAMN cAPS lock...).<br />It is very powerful, so stay seated, it&#039;s recommended to have a sitter with you, and it&#039;s bext done in late afternoon (the lighting is perfect for what &amp; who you see. It also has &quot;anti-addicting&quot; properties )doesn&#039;t interact with your brain&#039;s opiate neuroreceptors, so it&#039;s not likely you;ll addict yourself. And you may have a strong religious experience, and it will be something you need (but might not want) to hear...

				@Omium<br /><br />From what i have read i have two ideas.&nbsp; LSD or the chocolate bars i keep seeing mentioned.<br />You are right, i want that experience of letting go of reality.&nbsp; There is no intention to hold on lol.<br /><br />However, ive also read alot about experiences just being 2 dimensional shapes when people shut their eyes etc, or a feeling of euphoria.&nbsp; Dont get me wrong euphoria would certainly be nice, but which one out of the two i mentioned would give that feeling of everything around me changing, like in the dream world.<br /><br />Am i correct in saying you are suggesting LSD?&nbsp; If so, thats what ill go for.

				After reading through the thread, I have a few suggestions. Psychedelics are very much like a pool. First, you can get your feet wet, get comfortable, and slowly learn to swim. Second, you can jump in the shallow end. Third, you can jump in the deep end. Fourth, you can be the pool.<br /><br />You have a beautiful mind-set for tripping already and regardless of your decision I wish you a pleasant and profound experience. However, I find it best to lose any expectations I have from the trip beforehand. Embrace the moment and always remember, &quot;this is the trip.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23610.msg275117#msg275117">Quote from: Adasel on June 05, 2012, 07:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You are right, i want that experience of letting go of reality.&nbsp; There is no intention to hold on lol.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I would usually recommend mushrooms (~3g) as I personally feel less in-control of the trip on mushrooms and usually enjoy more deeply profound thoughts. <br />LSD usually keeps me more grounded and aware while tripping, so for letting go of reality I need 400ug+<br /><br />As far as who&#039;s shrooms to buy, just be sure to do your research on a vendor before purchasing. I&#039;ve had great luck with Rocker and Galindoi&#039;s products.<br />(Note: These are my personal doses and doses DO vary between people)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23610.msg275117#msg275117">Quote from: Adasel on June 05, 2012, 07:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, ive also read alot about experiences just being 2 dimensional shapes when people shut their eyes etc</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>These are CEVs (Closed Eye Visuals) and their intensity will increase with dosage as well. Those 2-D shapes eventually become a 4-D universe, aliens/gods/entities included.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23610.msg275117#msg275117">Quote from: Adasel on June 05, 2012, 07:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dont get me wrong euphoria would certainly be nice, but which one out of the two i mentioned would give that feeling of everything around me changing, like in the dream world.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Although it isn&#039;t one of the two, I can&#039;t bring myself to recommend anything other than DMT for this level of experience. DMT is generally smoked, but since you prefer to avoid smoking there is a lovely product that may be just for you, pharmahuasca. It is shorter-lasting than both Mushrooms and LSD, clocking in at 3-5 hours. The shamanic/spiritual visions of creatures/animals/entities are a significant possibility with DMT. You will lose grip of reality and may breakthrough to hyperspace, the infinitely patterned, rainbow-plasma colored, perspective-shifting, world-changing waiting room for the gods. Sound incredible? It is!<br />To make my life easier, I will copy/paste a product description from DiMiTriSpice&#039;s vendor page:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is DMT?<br /><br />DMT is a potent, short-acting hallucinogen of the tryptamine class of molecules. It is characterized by vivid dreamscapes, multidimernsional crystalline structures that pierce through this reality into another and a deep synchronicity with the universe and all its creatures. Without question, it is one of the strongest hallucinogenic substances on the planet. There are a couple different types of DMT, most notably 5-Meo-Dimethyltryptamine which is present in the Sonoran Desert toad (Bufo alvarius) and in a few species of plants(such as Arundo donax ). This is not our DMT as it has a tendency to be dark, scary, and a little bit overwhelming. Then there&#039;s N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, which is rightfully called the Spirit Molecule and is found in countless species of plants and animals. We liken N,N-DMT to smoking a dream. Its onset is almost immediate when smoked or injected. It&#039;s our favorite drug and that&#039;s why we do what we do. It truly changes a person&#039;s perception and empathy of and with the world.<br />...<br />What is pharmahuasca?<br /><br />Pharmahuasca is our take on ayahuasca. Instead of the traditional brew made by boiling plants for hours and hours and then drinking the gunky mixture, we have taken the active compounds out of the plant and put them into pill form for easy consumption. No more nausea, no more bad taste.<br /><br />How many should I take?<br /><br />You only need one. That&#039;s the beauty of it.<br /><br />How long does it last?<br /><br />Pharmahuasca lasts between 3 and 5 hours, depending on the person.<br />...<br />How does pharmahuasca compare to smoking DMT?<br /><br />Smoking DMT and taking pharmahuasca are both similar and different. With pharmahuasca, you still go to dmt-world but it&#039;s not that rocket ship into outerspace in 20 seconds kind of rush you get when smoking D. It comes on slower, progresses, peaks, and lets you down easy. Kind of like acid but the trip is totally different. It&#039;s its own creature. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you are interested in more info on the spiritual world that is DMT, the following article was written by a man with 40 years of experience making and using DMT.<br />http://www.serendipity.li/dmt/weebit2.pdf<br /><br />I finished this post in a rush, but am happy to expand upon anything I touched on above if necessary. Happy tripping, cheers to a new experiences.<br />
