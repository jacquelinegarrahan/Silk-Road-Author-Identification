				Yeah I just poked around trying to find some info on it. Been out at some RC suppliers for a while but narry a single person has put it in themselves yet from what i can see. There&#039;s two postings at bluelight from as early as May of last year but no trip reports. Same with all the other forums, talked about but not taken. Personally I wouldn&#039;t put it in me at this point but if you hear anything would love to know more.

				Interesting, thanks for sharing.<br /><br />I wonder if a new potent&nbsp; version of MXE will come out.

				honestly?<br />I think this is just another deadly chemical for the retards to kill themselves with. <br />i mean... the LD50 of these could be around the LD of cyanide.... which is 1,5 mg/kg......<br />&nbsp;potent drugs are very dangerous because people confuse potency with strength of effects.<br /><br />What is the point of this new chemical? What is the point of the Nboome chemicals? <br />the MXE guy was trying to find a cure for phantom limb pain. that&#039;s why he made it. That`s an honest reason. But this Ralf Heim...<br />I don&#039;t really understand. What is he trying to achieve? <br />

				Ralf Heim is becoming the heir apparent in the line of succession of psychedelic chemistry gods. Shulgin, Nichols, now Heim.<br /><br />Sure there were others, like William Leonard Pickard and Nick Sand, who innovated on production methods, but these guys created whole new classes of drugs.<br /><br />This is one reason why the War on Drugs can&#039;t be won. We haven&#039;t sampled a fraction of the space of possible organic molecules.<br />

				These NBOMe drugs are a fucking bastardization of LSD and Mescaline analogues. What is the need for them? If you have good clean LSD or mushrooms or mescaline why would you do any of this stupid shit? They offer no advantage and only increased risk. They exist solely for sleazeballs to make a quick dirty dollar of some stupid kid willing to risk his or her health for a high. Also, they are probably easier to make than LSD. If you want to help the human race you should be turning out good LSD-25 and not this garbage. Nichols is a brilliant man but shit like Bromo Dragon FLY had way to long lasting unexpected serious consequences as a result of its 5-HT2C receptor affinity and people lost limbs because of it. People shouldn&#039;t take this stuff before binding studies have been conducted.

				by which I mean, there are more effects out there than you can get from traditional psychedelics. By a lot. I don&#039;t know about these new chemicals , as I have sworn off taking untested drugs long ago now (well, sort of long ago), but the old school research chemicals are not really trying to replace traditional psychedelics. They are adding to the list of psychedelic experiences. If you want to limit yourself to the traditional psychedelics, more power to you I guess. But it is naive to say that only the traditional psychedelics are any good. They do tend to be some of the best (LSD IS the best), and they are pretty much all the safest, but they simply do not cover the same range of effects and time durations as the research chemicals do. None of the traditional psychedelics give cartooning or tracers like 2c-b does, for one out of thousands of examples. None of the traditional psychedelics give the same auditory distortions as DIPT or 5-meo-DIPT. There is a full world of psychedelics out there and saying they are all LSD knock offs for stupid kids who can&#039;t get LSD is just stupid.

				Thank you!&nbsp; This looks interesting.&nbsp; He will be at Psychedelic Science 2013.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be there because I&#039;m a psychologist.&nbsp; Is anyone else going?
