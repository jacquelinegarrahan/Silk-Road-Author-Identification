				Are there other users here that tried it once or only a few times? Or regs with advice or warnings<br />I&#039;m worried about just how addictive this stuff will be, and what a typical first time use will be like. fe, Ive heard things like trowing up excessively the first time you snort..<br />I&#039;m interested in hearing about ingestion methods, smoking vs snorting (i plan to try both). I dont IV anything, gota draw the line somewhere right. =&gt; Howto, tips, dosage, utilities<br />I&#039;m also interested in the difference between NR3, NR4 and Black Tar Heroin, what would you do if you only get one try?<br />Any info on preferred sellers is also welcomed.<br /><br />grtz,<br /><br />sam

				Do you have any Opiate expereince? I would hope so. I have only done H once, it was one line when I ended up in a weird situation, not planned at all. But I have wanted to try it out for real as well, but since I can&#039;t manage to get any coins on this site who knows if I will. So I don&#039;t really have the answers, but I have had 3 shoulder surgeries and have tried pretty much every pharmaceutical opioid in existence. I would be interested in what your background experience is, and how much different more experienced users find H than Pharms. I concquer with you drawing the line at not shooting, I have a feeling that avoiding addiction may be close to impossible once you start IVing, but is definitely possible if you avoid that ROA.

				Mmkay, well codeine is very weak, have you considered trying something else before H, to get a feel for Opiates before you dive into the deep end? Oxycodone has a near 90% bioavalibility when taken orally, so if you are worried about ROA being a possible route to addiction (which is completely valid) you could just try buying some percs and popping them, about 10-15 mg to start.&nbsp; That is a very enjoyable euphoric buzz that is both energizing and relaxing simultaneously, and although you can certainly become addicted by popping pills, the risks are less pronounced across the board.&nbsp; So that would be my &#039;harm reduction&#039; suggestion, as an alternative to going straight to H simply out of curiosity.

				Funny story, I tried H once.. sniffed about a quarter point.. i was in a court ordered drug rehab (get out of jail free card) and the only thing i was able to get my hands on was H<br /><br />this was 10 years ago btw actually it was Sep 9 2001 :(&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I remember asking the guy who gave it to me if he was crazy because I was used to sniffing fat lines of coke and now here is the tiny little bump... i thought he was just being stingy.. but he was just looking out for me... that little 1/4 point had me so fiucked up.. it was by far the best trip of my life.. no throwing up no headaches no withdraw.. just one sick trip then some sleep and a new day... when i woke up I knew if I ever tried it again i&#039;d be hooked and to this day I have not... that trip still remains the best trip i ever had!!<br /><br /><br />just so you know.. these days i only smoke weed and hash and have left the pills and lines in my past!!<br /><br />I have no clue about H besides for my one experence i told you about<br /><br /><br />if you do decide to try it.. make sure you set that line in your head between trying something once and becoming an addict.. trust me H 2 or 3 times and ur a goner ..<br /><br />good luck

				By the way,, you have no opiate tolerance which means a couple percs would probably have you high as shit as well as together not noddin&#039; off on dope. Don&#039;t listen to that ^ dude, don&#039;t do it especially since you are opiate naaive.

				I&#039;d be inclined to suggest &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot; because its about the best feeling in the world. <br /><br />I&#039;&#039;ve had morphine in hospital after surgery, and after about 20 mg of it it really did not mind just having some plates attached to a broken bone with screws that look like the kind you put plasterboard on plywood with. <br /><br />Trying something like heroin in like joining a gym - getting out of it after even a couple of exercises will prove very difficult and probably costly.

				H (and also Ket) was the difference between the line I drew and the line drawn by one of my good friend a few years ago.<br />We still have a difference today, but not the same:<br />I&#039;m still there on Earth, that&#039;s not his case...<br /><br />Just to precise: he died due to cut agents in H, not due to H OD.<br />Anyway, I respect everyone&#039;s opinion on the subject (even my friend&#039;s decision, it was his life, he was like that, with all his excesses), just ponder it a long time before taking your decision.

				Tnx for all replies guys.<br />Reading rauls story was very helpfull. Although still intregued about an opium high, i&#039;m not so eager to just go and buy some H now. Maybe i&#039;ll try some oxy instead, something i can buy as a 1 time dose .<br />I never realised 250mg would last you so long, knowing me thats not a good idea :-)<br />

				Another aspect of H that seems really shitty to me, speaking of Roaul Duke&#039;s thread, you get sick after doing a bit too much, the next day? I&#039;m not talking withdrawal, I&#039;m talking about like an H hangover? That fucking sucks, I hate hangovers and one of the reasons I love oxys and hydros so much is that I can take like 3-4 doses of oxy in a day (aka be high literally the entire day) usually after surgery, and what happens is my head eventually hits the pillow, I sleep great,&nbsp; and I wake up the next morning feeling absolutely wonderful. Literally no hangover to speak of, ever. I struggle enough with Alcohol hangovers, which really suck, and thats why I appreciate opiates (the ones that I do) because of the freedom from the hangover bullshit.&nbsp; Thats why you should just pop oxys and hydros, and try to keep your individual dose under 30mg, ideally under 20mg, and you be good. Fuck H!

You talking to me? I&#039;ve tried every opiate, including IV of hydromorphone, morphine, and fentanyl. (all in the hospital).

Hospital IV for super severe pain is one thing, when you cop a bag of smack just to get high its an entirely new habit; not a good one.
