				Are there any enactogens that actually work in people who are on SN/DRI (NOT SSRIS !!!!!!!!!!!!) ?<br /><br />Psilocybin did nothing, LSD (mitanoxes, so it was real) made me tired after an hour and then I went to sleep lol, MDMA and methylone nothin (except some sweat and jaw clenching), MXE nothing cept a MILD rush.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tasted any phenethylamines derivatives (2C&#039;s) cuz my track record seems to be not so good.&nbsp; I have 2C-I, C, P, B, T-7.<br /><br />Anyone with any experience know if any PEA analog will confer efficacy?&nbsp; Or any psychadelic for that matter? (other then DMT, i&#039;m leaving that for a special ... end of life present to myself).

				First of all...

I could not get an erection ..... period).<br /><br />That&#039;s why I moved to med&#039;s that target the other 2 &#039;mood neurotransmitter&#039;, which I can say I get erections no problem.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it targets the re-uptake of Dopamine, not Serotonin.<br /><br />Don&#039;t you even know that i&#039;m a PhD biochemist that&#039;s been on this boards for months giving people advice on such topics?&nbsp; If not, then why are you even trying to offer me advice, you&#039;re not qualified at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyways, if there&#039;s anyone else with suggestions who doesn&#039;t want to snarly dictate them to me as if he is right (your wrong 3285blah and your snarly ass little &quot;first of all&quot; pisses me off)<br /><br />Thanks ZA6wUw8a, 4-FA was actually at the top of my list of possibilities, that and MXE.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not too sure i&#039;m interested in the 4-FA, I don&#039;t want energy, rush, the things amphetamines cause (but will tolerate them if it&#039;s part of the trip.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got BADDDDD anxiety, so im still on the fence with taking PEAs like 4-FA because from what i&#039;ve read it juices u up with energy and focus, but little to no visuals.&nbsp; But I could be wrong.<br /><br />I guess I should say WHAT I want :D<br /><br />Looking for an entheogenic experience principly, but that&#039;s highly unlikely.&nbsp; Second thing is the euphoria that comes with opiates, MDMA blah ... just euphoria, in any of its many manifestations.<br /><br />Was considering giving 2C-B a whirl because i&#039;ve heard it has &#039;MDMA like properties to it&#039; even though its a powerful hallucinogen.<br /><br />Frustrating thing is I kinda wanted to enter the realm of psychadelics slowly, eg. with 2C-C, 2C-I but it seems my options are highly limited.

				Quinone i´m sure 328502E just wanted to help you, no need to get angry over mistakes - thats what forums are for. ;)<br /><br />I think the reason why serotonergic Psychedelics don´t work for you is that Venlafaxine (Effexor) not only inhibits norepinephrine reuptake but also serotonin (in high doses even dopamine) and thus prevents the effects of lsd etc. the same way ssri´s do.<br /><br />2c-x are (afaik) also serotonergic Psychedelics.<br /><br />There a a few vaguely psychadelic drugs that should work in you situation, but most have some unpleasant side-effects.<br />Ibogaine, DPH, Atropine, Muscimol are some of these, whereby i wouldn´t recommend any of those.<br /><br />Your best bet (besides ditching the Venlafaxine) are NMDA receptor antagonists like Ketamine imho.<br /><br />Hope i could help you.

				I would say your best option is probably Ketamine. Being a lover of psychedelics, I actually particularly enjoyed the colorfulness and dreaminess of Ketamine (at least in my experiences). That being said, I really didn&#039;t enjoy MXE, which gave me temporary color-blindness (which was very strange).<br /><br />Salvia could also be an option, though I admittedly am not sure how it works. That might require more work. You also may want to look into Nitrous Oxide, which I particularly enjoyed (and found similar to some psychs), though I noticed it was particularly potentiated when I was on an SSRI. Both of those probably warrant more research.<br /><br />As far as the deliriants go, I would really recommend against using them. I&#039;ve used DPH and muscimol before, and I would have to say that, while it is interesting how much you can hallucinate, it is most certainly not worth the terror of the experience.<br /><br />I had the same problems as you with my SSRI (along with some others), but I decided to quit it instead of switching (and cold-turkey at that, which was a HORRIBLE idea). I certainly can&#039;t determine what your condition may warrant medically, but I was and still am very happy to be off my SSRI, and you may like to be off it as well.

				The nitrous oxide usually gives me pretty intense visuals when I use it in combination of marijuana, and many of my friends have noticed the same effects. If you haven&#039;t tried the combination before, you might want to give it a go. I usually don&#039;t enjoy nitrous very much by itself.
