				Hey Silk Road travelers. I have tried &quot;local&quot; H, and being in the south east of the US, both times I think I got ripped off. never felt a thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I am very familiar with doing pharma opiates IV, the other day for instance I ran 120 mg Oxycodone and didnt even get a nod, just a nice little rush, which lasted all of 3 minutes maybe.<br /><br />Is there much cross-tolerance between H and Oxy? Because the stuff on here, if as advertised is a whole strata above any H I have ever tried.<br /><br />I plan to make my first SR purchase soon, I am just trying to decide which vendor I want to go with. <br /><br />My question is as follows, I plan to do titrated doses, probably starting out with a very small amount of what ever I end up with. I have a healthy respect for the H, I am just ignorant of the qualities of good H, and there is the fear of the unknown.<br /><br />If I take a cautious approach, is there a likely hood of killing myself? <br /><br />I really would like to avoid having my wife come home to find me with a rig hanging out of my cold arm.

				If you&#039;re willing to spend the money, why not be extra cautious and try sniffing it first? Much less chance you&#039;ll OD.<br /><br />Or just start really, really small. You can always take more.

Depending on how hard it kicks your ass (if at all) and if you start nodding, you can gauge from there how strong it is. <br /><br />Either way, I would still start very, very small. And be careful with re-dosing, if you feel compelled to. One time I shot half of a dose I measured out, waited a few minutes, and after feeling nothing I shot the other half and OD&#039;d. Stupid, stupid.<br /><br />
