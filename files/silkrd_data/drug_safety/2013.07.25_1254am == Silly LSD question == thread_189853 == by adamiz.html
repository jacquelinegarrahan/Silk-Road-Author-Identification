				Hey folks. So I am stoned and just relaxing with my guitar and thinking of different stuff.<br /><br />Everyone has his own fights with himself telling lets do that and you get the response from you again &quot;no don&#039;t&quot;.<br />So, I am sitting here and an idea came to my mind but left really early.<br /><br />And my silly question is:<br />What if you where really tired and you know that if you go to sleep you will be dreaming in less than 10 minutes, and just before you are about to sleep you take one LSD blotter??&nbsp; :D :D :D :D<br /><br />Will you wake up and let the lsd take control, or will you have a nice sleep/dream phase when LSD kicks in??? <br />I am really wondering....&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Anybody done that? <br />I am asking not because I want to try it, simply out of pure stoningness curiosity...<br /><br />Happy days people!<br /><br />Adamiz

				Ive done it a few times, not with a lot of tabs, 1 or 2 but i almost immediately wake myself up and just start enjoying the trip.<br /><br />I want to try it when i am really tired though, maybe even take some sleeping pills, i am curious about the dreams!!!<br /><br />

				I have too many years of lsd under my belt, and i simply cannot understand how any of you can sleep on lsd.&nbsp; i tried taking a dose right before i fell asleep and you wake the fuck up when it kicks in lol.&nbsp; i can understand falling asleep on 100ug as thats not even a high dose so light but 300ug and i doubt anyone will be able to fall asleep until the afterglow

				there is not way you will sleep with a 100Âµg and up dose... LSD is major drug as I can understand it (as is alcohol)... said this, lsd activates some circuits (smeralds, shits, whatever you want to all them)and as I know for 2 cd is a drug you will not be able to sleep<br /><br />saying this I thing my buddies will agree that there are different doses on lsd and that they will give you different outcomes. from the laugh to the completely ego disappearance. Going to all the intermediate states. I think it will be easy to sleep from the come down of low doses of lsd, but I am not sure because I never end my lsd experience with my finger in mu but.So I am virgin. I know I got to the disolution of the ego, but I know you can go further. LSD is not a joke,&nbsp; and if yoy think it it is, you are trap hahahahahaha<br /><br />if you want to take control, personally, take ketamin... shorter time, and without any feelings invoved<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I second tintin23 and others.&nbsp; It most likely would keep you up.&nbsp; I have a hard time sleeping after tripping for 6 hrs, even though I often have no trouble sleeping after doing coke most of the night or mdma. <br />Whether it&#039;s mental or physiological, I&#039;m not too sure, but LSD gets you thinking, and it&#039;s hard to sleep when you&#039;re thinking.
