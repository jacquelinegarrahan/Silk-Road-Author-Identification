				i take it your GF has not grew up around drugs lol<br /><br />all drugs can be addictive as iv nearly been hooked on meth and H, but iv learned threw the years to mix my drug intake up and never IV, eg i smoke weed every wk but not daily, smoke H 1 to 2 times a month, and snort meth or coke once a month, crack on special occasions when i can afford it and i keep shrooms to the one time yr when they grow in my country this alone has stopped me getting hooked... <br /><br />i think ur GFs right tho about weed being mentally addictive, as when i go 3 to 4 days without smoking any, i get headaches, im extra irritable and i have problems sleeping, but this only lasts for a day or two, then i couldnt care less if i never seen it again, well, untill i get my next bag that is, then i turn into a weed snob again lol<br /><br />lets face it weed is most commonly used drug not to mention most socialably acceptable aswell... most of my friends are all ex addicts to some sort of drug, and even when they manage to get ontop of their addiction and stop using hard drugs, they are still smoking weed lol <br /><br />weed in my opinion is the nector of the gods and i will probably die an old hippy&nbsp; ;D

				Smoking weed is bad for your lungs (smoking anything really) and most marijuana users tend to hold in the smoke longer so more tar builds up which is why it&#039;s better to do edibles or a vaporizer.<br /><br />While it&#039;s not physically addictive it can be mentally addictive. For example, I have a friend that can&#039;t sleep without smoking right before bed. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been in the cannabis community for a long time now and while I don&#039;t use it anymore I still love the culture. For me some of the cons of weed was the short term memory loss (sometimes I would walk into a room high and forget why I went into that room in the first place), the loss of dreams (If I didn&#039;t smoke for a couple of days I would get vivid dreams) and the main one for me was the slowing of reflexes. I know people that go to work high or to school high, I could never perform at 100% while being high.<br /><br />The pros outweigh the cons compared to other drugs but I feel like marijuana is the drug that is the most abused. To each his own though, one man&#039;s medicine is another man&#039;s poison.&nbsp; ;)

				Skipping the harm caused by smoking substances in general (like cigarettes), the risks are pretty limited.<br /><br />Many people enjoy smoking some pot once in a while without any ill effect. This is the vast majority of casual users. <br /><br />However, some people do develop a form of dependence with cannabis - perhaps not physically, but at least mentally. I suppose that condition best compares to OCD, which can be very unpleasant to suffer from. This would lead to a behavior like requiring a joint in order to sleep, while there really is no physiological need to smoke one.

				marijuana has helped me immensely, as i&#039;ve been chronically ill for a decade. it relieves all my bodily pain, treats my depression and insomnia, and allows me to eat. the only negative is it&#039;s hard for me to get used to being without it, as my pain is very bad.

If you give THC to lab animals they will self-administer it which is used to asses the addictiveness of a drug. But despite what some people say there is no evidence of a physical withdrawal when use is stopped.&nbsp; As far as I know, there is no evidence that it causes brain damage. In fact alcohol is the only commonly used drug known to cause brain (and other organ) damage.&nbsp; There is a fairly convincing amount of evidence of an association between teenage marijuana use and development or triggering of schizophrenia. There is no evidence that marijuana can cause schizophrenia in people who would not otherwise get it, but that it may trigger it earlier in life than it would have otherwise occurred. As far as psychoactive drugs go Marijuana is very safe - you cant overdose and die. Hundreds of people die every year from overdoses of easily available drugs like aspirin and paracetamol (tylenol). Marijuana is not harmless or risk free , but then almost nothing in life is. We all do risky things every day , like drive a car or eat unhealthy foods and so on.&nbsp;
