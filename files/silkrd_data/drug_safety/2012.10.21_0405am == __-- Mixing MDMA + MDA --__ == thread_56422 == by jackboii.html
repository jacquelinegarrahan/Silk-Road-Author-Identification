				&nbsp;;D&nbsp; Just a couple questions and hopefully I could get some answers from some experiences that have been done.<br /><br />A friend came across some MDMA crystals and some MDA in powder form, both came back positive on the test kit for each specific substance, and would like to know what amount of each they should take. I understand you are supposed to take 2mg of MDMA per kilogram in bodyweight to get the best bang out of your buck, but combining the two substances how much of each should they combine together if they have a medium/almost high tolerance? <br /><br />If you all could please share your experiences and let me know what would be the best remedies I would greatly appreciate it, thanks!&nbsp; 8)

				Your weight is very important here but generally when taking drug combos you want to reduce your normal average dose amount for both drugs.<br /><br />If you generally take 125 mg mdma then I would take 100 mdma and 70-80 mda

				My friend usually takes 160mg MDMA, thats their sweet spot, so what would be good for that to mix? And is it even good to mix the two? Anyone have any experiences on what the high is like?

				I&#039;m trying this combo my first time next time I roll. I was thinking 120mg MDMA with 75MG MDA. Heard this will be a good dose. <br />My usual MDMA dose is around 160mg (I&#039;m ~75kg&#039;s. I like to get fucked up lol).

				Been looking into this topic as well, as there are a couple vendors that are selling capsules with both in them. One vendor sells at 70/50, or 140/100 if you take two capsules. I think if you&#039;re taking 165, a good pair would probably be 125/70ish
