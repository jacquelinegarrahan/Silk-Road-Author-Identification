				Like the title says,<br /><br />I&#039;ll be taking low dose (10-20ug) of LSD for the first 2 weeks of this starting semester.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a lot about how LSD has nootropic affects. I will be updating this thread with my results. If anyone has had experience with this, please share it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that when taking normal lsd doses (200ug), problem solving becomes exponentially easier. It&#039;s as if the solution was that easy the whole time, you just never thought of the problem that way. It also makes me more creative, gives me energy and drive, and makes me feel good.<br /><br />I hope this will work. LSD is a wonder drug.

				LSD and Psilocybin (sp?) are both in clinical trials for cluster headaches.&nbsp; Its about time.&nbsp; Perhaps other beneficial information will come from these trials - such as the nootropic properties.<br /><br /><br />http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/06/lsd-alleviates-suicide-headaches.html

				Let us know how it goes.&nbsp; ;D I&#039;ve taken low doses too before just for the hell of it but I think I ended up taking a bit too much, ~37micrograms. Music still sounded funky, minor tracers and I was a bit too aware for that setting.<br /><br />I agree it helps you with problem solving. That&#039;s one of the reasons I take LSD. I sit down for an hour in darkness and put everything in perspective. Mushrooms are really good for that too.<br /><br />I look forward to reading about your experiment. :)

I&#039;m way off on the name but it&#039;s not regular cubensis, they&#039;re a bit weaker which I like personally) I would take one cap and start working on orders and it made my thoughts more clear, I would take one cap and just start coming up with random ideas (like the giant gummy bear lol) and write them down in a small notebook. <br /><br />I really do hope he comes back, for now I have Tryptamine&#039;s supplements, I love them!

				I tried this before. It definitely enhanced my creativity, visualisation, and abstract thinking. You can also combine a low dose of Adderall and a low dose (i.e. sub-hallucinogenic) of LSD for nootropic effects, but avoid if prone to anxiety or paranoia.

I don&#039;t like either as a psychedelic though but some people prefer going into their holes, I can&#039;t do it, too scared&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37616.msg433233#msg433233">Quote from: psychedelia on August 27, 2012, 12:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I tried this before. It definitely enhanced my creativity, visualisation, and abstract thinking. You can also combine a low dose of Adderall and a low dose (i.e. sub-hallucinogenic) of LSD for nootropic effects, but avoid if prone to anxiety or paranoia.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Finally someone to back me up, I did LSD and added 5mg of adderall and it was an amazing experience.

				Have done microdosing before, for three months. I think it&#039;s great.<br /><br />The most important thing to know about HPPD is to appreciate the good stuff, and not to fear the bad stuff (&quot;disorder&quot; refers to the bad stuff). Every time you fear, you reinforce that part of your mind—the correct response is to accept, and massage it back into your perception. The tear in your mind from overexpansion will slowly disappear. Never give up caring for your mind.
