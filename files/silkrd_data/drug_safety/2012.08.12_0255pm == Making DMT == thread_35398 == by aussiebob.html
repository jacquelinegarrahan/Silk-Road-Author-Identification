				So yeah, I have a chemistry friend and we happen to live in a sweet area for a type of plant which yields high ammounts of dmt. So he did some research came up with an extraction method with his friend and the help of the internet and we went ahead and made it. However we were expecting white crystals. What we got was black kind of crystal dust stuff, not the yield we were expecting at all. Our question is, is it safe to try? He said there was no way his method would create anything poisonous but now we are trepidations about trying it.<br /><br />We used sodium hydrochloride to melt down the bark and plant matter, Let that sit for 24 hours and stirred it often, Then we added white spirit to seperate the dmt out and allowed the white spirit once mixed through to evaporate in a tray. once disolved it appeared to be white when we collected it it went black. <br /><br />Any ideas if this is safe to smoke?

				It&#039;s possible that what you got wasn&#039;t as pure/clean as you wanted, which explains the change in colour. However, you might have fucked it royally and have something totally different out. There&#039;s no easy way to tell. <br /><br />I definitely wouldn&#039;t advise smoking it unless you are more confident. You&#039;d be amazed how toxic some things that you could happily eat are if you inhale the smoke. <br /><br />Be really careful. If you screwed up the A/B extraction it could have god-knows-what in it.
