				So, I had my wisdom teeth taken out today, all 4. I got scripted for a 5-325 percocet. I&#039;m experiencing the &quot;opiate itch&quot;, I had the same 2 years ago for a different surgery with Oxycontin. I was wondering if anyone had advice or ideas to lessen the annoying itch. Makes me feel like a meth head (no offense).&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the help

				benadryl will help with the itching, but be careful if you use it along with the medicine, it can amplify the effects (such as the drowsiness.)

				Thanks, I&#039;ll hunt around in my bathroom for that. Would something like nyquil work? or does it has to be an histamine?

				the antihistamine in nyquil won&#039;t help with the itch.<br /><br />people may also use nyquil. dxm in it is an opiate potentiator, if that is something you were going for. also will increase the sedative effect of the opiate<br />

				Second to what cosmos said about the h1-antihistamines not working.<br /><br />Not-impressive evidence (better than nought) for ondansetron, although it&#039;s usually been given IV in the studies of which I&#039;m aware. If you have a rx for it, worth a try. <br />

				Nyquil will help. It has a potent antihistamine in it called doxylamine. It is stronger than diphenhydramine/benadryl for inducing sleep, but slightly weaker as an antihistamine.<br /><br />However you&#039;ve best off just buying the diphenhydramine/benadryl pills or doxylamine(brand name unisom) instead of drinking the nasty nyquil, especially since you just got your wisdom teeth out.

				I just tried some Benadryl - it&#039;s definitely helping keep me from itching like a maniac!<br />

				Call me crazy but I enjoy the itch.<br /><br />But an anti-histamine would help most likely.

				Update: I brought liquid gels of benadryl yesterday, took two. It knocked me out for a good 12+ hour sleep. I&#039;m pretty sure that benadryl had little to do with the drowsiness but it def did help with the itches. I give up on painkillers, stupid codiene allergies. I&#039;m waiting for my xanax/vals to come in so I can grab a couple more nights of perfect sleep so I can heal faster. <br /><br />Thank you for your help!
