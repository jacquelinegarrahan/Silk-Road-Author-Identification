				I read a study once about the efficacy of LSD in treating alcoholism. Don&#039;t quote me on the numbers, but it was something like AA leads to sobriety 30-40% of the time, and LSD worked 70% of the time. Hmmm...

				Off of memory from the article I read day before yesterday it was research out of Norway analyzing a study from the 1960&#039;s. ~550 subjects, ~350 dosed with 200-800ug of LSD and the control group had a 25-50ug dose or other alcohol treatment programs. Those with the high dose of LSD had a 59%(?) chance of remaining abstinent compared to a 38%(?) in the control group. <br /><br />The effects diminished with time, and those in the high dose group had the best results over the first 6 months. Still, a researcher noted that other pharm products don&#039;t have these kind of long term results from a single dose. <br /><br />Honestly it makes sense to me. Psychedelics have always given me a better view of my life and some motivation to make the changes necessary to live a happy life.<br /><br />It does seem psychedelics are slowly starting to creep back into the research world though. Couldn&#039;t have been more than a month or two ago I read a report on Magic Mushrooms treating Depression. And of course Dr. Strassman&#039;s public DMT trials :)

				I think this is beginning of psychedelics legalization. First they claim LSDs positive influence, then they find out that it is undangerous, and so then we have legal ways to obtain LSD in 10 years in EU and in 20-30 years in my shitty Russia&nbsp; &gt;:(

NPR (US National Public Radio) did a story on it not long ago. I can personally attest to having taken LSD only once. Before that night I was an alcoholic. A friend and I could and would kill a half gallon of vodka in a day. It was pathetic. Since taking lsd I&#039;ve drank one sip of beer and it was a total turn off. I have a physical aversion to it where I used to want to go get drunk. Only after taking the LSD did I hear about the alcoholism cure thing.

				- thanks for input guys, i will have to&nbsp; (somehow) work out if the UK new item is to be repeated that way we can gauge whether its leading to<br />&nbsp; something or not.<br /><br />- reading a couple reports:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;that certain organisations were finding the governments unwillingness &quot;to allow&quot;research LSD etc as &quot;unbearable&quot;?!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;yet research was possible by just applying for a special licence?! {yeah right...}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sounds all to familiar - research available they&#039;ll just make it so difficult to get one hence why there&#039;s such little &quot;research&quot; {uk}.<br /><br />- anyone here from a prominent uk uni?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:( &gt;:(<br />

				Hmm I knew there were tests done in the 50&#039;s, and I&#039;m pretty sure the success rates were closer to 10% for AA and 50-60% for LSD, interesting that it is coming up again now.<br /><br />I know the first time I did acid last year, my drinking stopped completely for a while and has cut down a hell of a lot since. My reasoning was that the effects of the LSD were just so much more amazing and uplifting, why would I want to get drunk again in comparison? Its made a huge difference. Of course, I have now turned to weed to help me get to sleep instead, but thats not as bad as alcohol in small amounts so I still consider it a step forward.<br /><br />I just found a new study published this year showing that it decreases alcohol abuse as well.<br /><br />http://jop.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/03/08/0269881112439253.full.pdf+html<br /><br />I&#039;m not too sure government would completely legalize a substance that blows your mind for 10-14 hours. I could see it potentially become less restricted and more of a controlled substance though. From all the research I have done, it does seem fairly harmless as long as you aren&#039;t tripping out every week or more.

				http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/09/lsd-may-help-treat-alcoholism/<br /><br />If you look at the bottom, articles like this have been popping up recently. There&#039;s a section about ibogaine in there. And on TIME! There was that study with mushrooms a few months back too (http://www.psychointegrator.com/2011/06/magic-mushrooms-can-improve-psychological-health-long-term/) and the one with ketamine mentioned above. Plus all of the ones done in the &#039;60s and whatnot.<br /><br />I think all this research FINALLY coming up is a good sign, non?<br /><br />(http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2807%2960464-4/fulltext#article_upsell &quot;Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse&quot; this is an interesting read if you&#039;re willing to register just to read it)

				It&#039;s definitely a good sign. As someone else said, while I don&#039;t see it being completely legalised, I think that it (and other psych&#039;s) will become available to help people in need. <br /><br />Also to note on psilocybin (mushrooms), they&#039;re apparently an amazing cure (or preventative) of cluster headaches. My TOR is extremely slow at the moment or I&#039;d find some links.

				This was actually a topic study undertaken by a Finnish team. Essentially they examined the relevant scientific<br />publications from between the 1920&#039;s and 60&#039;s, determined which of those had followed correct protocol, and from the ~9-12 (I can&#039;t remember exactly) which remained, they compiled an average of those results. From this they were able to support the conclusion that a single dose LSD treatment achieved the same (40%) rate of success as those achieved by much longer term contemporary treatment programs.

				- been doing some looking round, there&#039;s quite a lot reports suggesting new testing/research going on seems to be off the back of the finnish<br />&nbsp; research from what i can tell -there may be other reasons for instance the drug czar who was sacked and then mass resignations of experts<br />&nbsp; who followed, so why its taken so long for action is unknown.<br />&nbsp; Some research are aimed at curing / alleviating various disorders..<br /><br />- so what&#039;s happened to the LSD cure for alcoholism then?! Every news report mentions and confirms this, its not like its being used in therapy<br />&nbsp; not that i&#039;ve heard of but then i don&#039;t know any alcoholics nor read that the local NHS {national health/hospitals etc..} are using it...?!<br /><br />- isn&#039;t that what the men in white coats / scientists love to do is reinvent the raw drug into their version of the &quot;cure&quot; in the form of a tablet,<br />&nbsp; they&#039;ll be damned if patients are allowed to get high...<br /><br />- i once saw a movie / hour long documentary which laid out the scenario of what could happen if a load of drugs were decriminalised and<br />&nbsp; allowed in medicinal production.<br />&nbsp; &quot;the board&quot; were driven by the millions/billions they would make and disregarded the chemists concerns {who were taken on under false<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;pretense they would continue to develop medicinal drugs to benefit the entire human race....bollocks}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;basically new concoctions / recipes were created out of heart disease medication &amp; designer drugs which resulted in people dying..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t recall what is was called...definitely a reminder of what corporations would get up to and where their priorities lie.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />- i don&#039;t recall seeing this sort of interest before, any reports have been on some 16yr old overdosing and in a coma etc...<br /><br />so its looking positive!!<br /><br />&nbsp;:D :D :D<br />
