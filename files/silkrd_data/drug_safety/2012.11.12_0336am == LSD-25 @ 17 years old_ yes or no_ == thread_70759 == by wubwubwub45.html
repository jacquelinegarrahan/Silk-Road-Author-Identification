				I for the most part agree with Long Hair, my first hit was at 17 to man and it was the most incredible thing i have experienced to date. ive just never felt it to be such a big deal, or a crazy thing,its a beautiful thing and has never let me down or turned me off in any way, as long as its LEGIT L from a reputable source. its not what most of the world works it up to be dude. i say drop a hit with some close buddys or gfs put on some beatles or floyd and get ready for the ride of your life. when your at a place where your comfy and the trip has settled in if possible, manly if it can be done safely, go outside or in your yard or somthing nature is beautful man, or even just what youve known as reality is just an incredibly different and wonderful place. goodluck man id be intersted to hear how it goes.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I would honestly say no because your brain is still developing. It could cause huge problems if you have any mental health history ANYWHERE in your family tree. I would recommend that you wait until you are a young adult(21+) and out of your parents house. I think that there is no harm in you smoking herb and occasionally doing drugs like mdma(reputable source) at this time in your life but its your mind, your body, your life and your decision. I tried lsd at 16 and had a great time but a friend who tried it with me had MAJOR trouble after it. he found out that his great grandma had a mental condition and the lsd brought it out on him big time. After he tried it he struggled with severe depression, paranoia and delusional thoughts. So to sum it up: its your decision but be safe.

				I first dropped acid when I was 15. I did two tabs and they were insanely strong. My brother and I were both surprised and together we tripped for about 9 or 10 hours. Crazy crazy stuff..but in all honesty it really changed me as a person (in a good way). I enjoyed exploring a whole part of my mind I may not have been able to find without taking LSD. That being said, if you don&#039;t think you&#039;re ready to do it, then don&#039;t. Use it to learn, not to party. <br /><br /><br />Unless it&#039;s a really cool party.

				Go for it, be responsible, do research, don&#039;t get caught :) The usual. It&#039;d be hypocritical of me or a lot of the posters here to say otherwise. I did shrooms and acid at 18 and enjoyed the fuck out of both. They both changed me in a positive way as well in my opinion.<br /><br />Basically don&#039;t be an idiot, set and setting.

				Alright guys , thanks for the answers. I think i will wait to drop&nbsp; acid since like you said drganja my grand-mother has an Alzheimer disease and i wouldnt like to take the risk of having issues after. I always wanted to drop acid but oh well , i guess ill stick with the molly every now and then.

				I&#039;d advice you to try shrooms first. They don&#039;t come on as strong. It&#039;s hard to describe to someone who hasn&#039;t tried either before, but LSD is &quot;sharp&quot;, shrooms are &quot;soft&quot;. But it&#039;s up to you.<br /><br />But if you have insecurities, which is think is very likely for a 17-yearold, you should watch out. They might come out to haunt you while you&#039;re tripping, so be sure you can handle them. If you have things that are too painful for you to even think about, then don&#039;t do psychedelics.

				There&#039;s no age for that...&nbsp; Some lady told me a while ago, that she first took acid at the age 13 with her friends before they went to school... ??? That&#039;s the weirdest story I&#039;ve ever heard. Of course they haven&#039;t learned anything from that. If you feel mature enough to open your mind &amp; learn something and also feel balanced and mentally healthy - You can go for it.<br /><br />Happy tripping&nbsp; ;)

				LSD&nbsp; is safe, and I think it&#039;s safer than mushrooms. And it is transforming expirience, everyone should try LSD at least once. Now you are in springtime of your youth, your perception is clear and fresh. But do you want to try it now, or you are rushing things? Only you can answer that question. I only can say, that before trip I would have fasted for a week or two: eating healthy vegetarian food, not taking any drugs, even coffee, not masturbate or having sex. It is necessary to put you spirit at peace and make mind more resilient. Almost no one is doing that, but I can assure you that each grain your effort will come back to you, and undoubtedly trip begins long before taking a drug.

				My first LSD experience was at age 17 and it was life changing, and even though I had been doing mushrooms since I was 15, LSD was a completely different experience all together. All it took was half a tab of LSD-25 made by some crazy Czech scientist, and I spent a good 6-7 hours rewriting my entire history up until then. Things that I had never thought about up until that point in time in my life (especially concerning societal issues, government, the life force of nature etc) suddenly made sense, which was weird because I had no frame of reference to pinpoint where these feelings suddenly welled up from.<br /><br />Def enjoyable

				I don&#039;t think anyone necessarily should take LSD or any other drug, but if you are going to be doing illicit drugs anyway, I think it&#039;s better to take LSD or mushrooms than neurotoxins like MDMA. As much as I like MDMA, I think it should be avoided especially when your brain is still developing.

				...I tried it first at age 15 .whilst is was quite fun and all..In the subsequent years after that .Tried it several more times ...At that age we really didn&#039;t ave any respect for the substance ...And would often times combine it with other stuff like marijuana...When combining ,this would sometimes lead to bad trips,and one of the reasons at age 19 i stopped tripping for several years......I think being over age 20 ,would be alot better...But 1 time i might not be too bad ....But much better to wait to wait till a bit older...judt my 2 cents

				I think 17 is a fine age to try it if you are ready. Still, I stand behind not admitting to being a minor here.&nbsp; ;)

This is relatively minor issue about underage. We should just remain honest. And I don&#039;t think every 16yo is not responsible for his deeds, and if he is not, I don&#039;t think he will in 21yo. I personally don&#039;t see huge differnce between thinking in my age (&gt;21), and in my sixteen.

				As for being 17 and rocking some LSD...I&#039;d say go for it...its again not about the age which has been mentioned, but more about your maturity and responsibility.<br /><br />If some 16 yr old is doing drugs and their parents don&#039;t know, then they are bad parents...bottom line... and if the kid takes control of his life and starts doing drugs, there is nothing the parents can do.&nbsp; Unless they want a all out war i guess....<br /><br />When i first took control i was 17, my parents tried to ground me and i said fuck you... and left... that was when i chose to look after myself and not be sheltered by parents.<br /><br />I experienced a great deal of drugs... mostly cocaine... which i am thankful for now as i hate that shit more than anything... if i never did it back then, well I&#039;d probably die of a heart attack doing it nowadays.<br /><br />Everybody has different paths of experience and knowledge, personally i believe i would be someone completely different if i was introduced to DMT and LSD when i was 17...who knows... probably would have been a more peaceful person all around....<br /><br /><br /><br />

It&#039;s just like being an avid gamer, both have health risks and both can be an addiction. In the case of an addiction it&#039;s wrong(which is the case for many that are gamers - they&#039;re addicted to games).<br /><br />And with both categories you can make foolish choices. Just society as it is has twisted things. I only plan on using psychedelics for their recreational use and because they aren&#039;t addictive like some other drugs.<br /><br />The way you put it &quot;the kid takes control of his life and starts doing drugs&quot; makes it seem like a dastardly thing, you could have used better wording. It&#039;s not the parent&#039;s fault if someone isn&#039;t planning on getting caught.

				Hey, Don&#039;t ask us if you&#039;re ready for LSD or not. You should be asking yourself that question. I had no one to ask &quot;Am I Ready for LSD?&quot; When the time came I felt ready for it and I went for it.

				I think that everyone before using any psychedelics should learn and read a lot about it... Knowledge it&#039;s most important imo... When we r confident about it I can&#039;t imagine bad trip... Stanislav Grof, Timothy Leary, Albert Hofmann, Sasha Shulgin it&#039;s basic... We need to be well prepared before trippin&#039;... Much love bros,<br /><br />acidsoldier
