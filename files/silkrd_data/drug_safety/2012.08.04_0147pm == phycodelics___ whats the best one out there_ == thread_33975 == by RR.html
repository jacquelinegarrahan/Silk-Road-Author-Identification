				i have been trying over the past few weeks to experience some thing truly spectacular. i started with 2x tabs of acid (Alice in wonderland) but they only had minimal effect, the most i saw was the letters moving on my pc screen and it kept me away all night.<br /><br />next i moved on to 25i-nbome and i found this a little more powerful and energetic, i watched avatar on this and it was a good film to watch while on 25i but again i still feel i want more visually, <br /><br />so i moved on to 25c-nbome and again its good in its own ways but again not powerful enough visually.<br /><br />i have tried mixing the two and found it created less of an effect than the compounds alone.<br /><br />so where is my next move??? i want something extreamly powerful that will really fuck my vision up??<br /><br />the best so far in my eyes is AMT. <br /><br />im looking at the 2c family but there are so many different ones i dont know what one to get, and also been thinking strooms what are they like??? <br /><br />someone help me here&nbsp; &nbsp;im running out of ideas and really want a big nasty mindfuck of a trip :(

				Mid-dosage LSD (400ug), High-dosage DMT (enough to break through), Mid-dosage psilocybin (7-10g dried). Each is the pinnacle of a different sort of hallucinogenic trip.

				DMT.<br /><br />Or, you can start working your way up with LSD, taking larger doses each time with a break between each trip to avoid wasting LSD because of a high tolerance, and work up to 2000 ug or higher. Shit gets crazy past the 1000 range, even moreso past 1500.<br /><br />Or both! And don&#039;t forget shrooms!

				In terms of the intensity of the hallucinations:<br /><br />DMT &gt; Mushrooms &gt; LSD &gt; Mescaline &gt; Marijuana <br /><br />(yes, marijuana is a psychedelic and it can produce hallucinations in sufficiently high dosages)<br /><br />In my experience, a very high dosage of mushrooms produces a more profound experience than an equivalent dosage of LSD. With LSD you will see geometric patterns, visual distortions, etc. With mushrooms (at very high dosages), you have dreamlike visions of other worlds. You can see the entities, hear voices that aren&#039;t there, etc. I&#039;ve never had that with LSD.<br /><br />As for research chemicals, I stay away from them because their long-term effects are unknown. Some of the ones that Shulgin developed may cause heart valve disease.

				I usually grind my shrooms up pretty fine and put them in some liquid nacho cheese and basically just drink that. Great way to cover the taste, and you don&#039;t really eat a lot of it so that&#039;s also a plus because eating a lot before a shroom trip could diminish the potency of the shrooms. But I&#039;d probably try to eat them straight your first time, just seems like the best way to go in my opinion.

				well, for 90% of people, I would tell them to do the shrooms first.....BUT after reading what you just wrote about your intentions with these psychedelics, I think you might actually benefit more from doing the DMT first.&nbsp; <br /><br />like everyone says, nothing will prepare you for DMT.&nbsp; however, you can use psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms as tools to decode the messages hidden in the DMT experience.&nbsp; if you take the shrooms after the DMT experience, the doors to your mind will be wide freaking open the the shrooms will have way more to talk about with you.<br /><br />so for you, RR, dear traveler, I think you should smoke a big ass mega hit of DMT and then take a full dose of shrooms either that same day, the day after, or next weekend.<br /><br />just my advice though.&nbsp; as always, go with your gut instict.

I try to do several thousand ug hits a few times a year (got one planned kinda soon actually) and it&#039;s not just a powerful LSD trip. It&#039;s almost like a completely different drug.

				yeah but ive tried low doses of acid i did 2x 125ug tabs and had very little effect and it was from a trusted vendor and had stunning reports in the feedback, but the most i saw or felt was the letters on the pc screen wobble a little and maybe a little change in mood, also felt like when i was reading on here other peoples replies and posts i felt like they where talking to me and i felt there personality come across 100&#039;s of times more than normal. how does it feel like a different drug can you explain more?

Anything lower is fun, but I find I want to go again the next weekend to try and get more out of the experience. It&#039;s like I&#039;m not getting where I want to be, and it sort of frustrates me. My last dose was 2.5 mg and it was an intense experience with ego death, mental visuals and lots of introspection. But I got what I needed, and even days later I;m feeling refreshed and able to handle the normal world better, like I&#039;ve hit a reset switch.<br /><br />One of these every few of months and I think I&#039;ll be on my way to enlightenment :)

You can visualize it as the X axis on a graph if that helps. Say shrooms are at (-5,0) and LSD is at (5,0) DMT is the Y axis. It&#039;s it&#039;s own seperate thing and only briefly touches the same axis, or as I like to think of it in tripping terms, dimension, as LSD and shrooms. There&#039;s a small connection there, and it&#039;s an important one, but there&#039;s so much more and it&#039;s so different that it&#039;s almost it&#039;s own class of drug.

My first trips with LSD were in nature. In fact, for me, LSD connects me with what you would call the natural-organic network, just as readily as shrooms. There&#039;s really nothing &#039;synthetic&#039; or artificial about it for me.<br /><br />As for DMT, all I can say is it&#039;s more like shrooms than LSD, but it is world&#039;s apart from both.

All up the last experience was over 18 hours (although the last 8 or so weren&#039;t tripping, just weren&#039;t baseline either) and I vomited a couple of times during the come up. But I felt even with the negative aspects it was well worth it :) I&#039;ve only had one other experience in this range and it was the same, intense, but well worth it. Comparing to all the lower doses I&#039;ve had I feel like I&#039;ve wasted a lot of L by not going hard enough.<br /><br />As I said above though, definitely not the approach I would recommend for everyone.

My first trips with LSD were in nature. In fact, for me, LSD connects me with what you would call the natural-organic network, just as readily as shrooms. There&#039;s really nothing &#039;synthetic&#039; or artificial about it for me.<br /><br />As for DMT, all I can say is it&#039;s more like shrooms than LSD, but it is world&#039;s apart from both.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />before my first lsd trip i did think of it as synthetic.. so yea that could be coloring my&nbsp; views.&nbsp; i never specifically heard anyone say such, but i did conclude that as the case while researching before i even tried lsd.&nbsp; i don&#039;t use the term synthetic in a negative connotation either; in fact i thoink lsd hold more relevance than shrooms since we all live in a electronic smogtropolis.<br /><br />lsd felt a bit foreign/external while shrooms felt more internal.&nbsp; my strongest lsd trip was in nature, shit i remember sacrificing my tabs of w/w to a puddle while following the natural energy path/bends in the forest. <br /><br />i look at lsd.. more like a telepathic communication from an outside spirit/archetype, very static.&nbsp; shrooms seem more like a one on one face 2 face conversation.

				just had my first DMT experience....<br /><br />started with 50mg using a 2l pop bottle with foil across the bottom, i got lots of smoke in the bottle and breathed it all in in one go, i held my breath as long as i could and i could see the wall paper in my front room start to ripple, i laid back and looked around and everything was 2d almost, very bright enhanced colors, especially yellow and creams where very eye catching, i then closed my eyes and saw colors, bright spinning hexagon shaped discs, but it quickly wore off.<br /><br />next i tried 65mg then 75mg then 100mg but cant seem to get anywhere close to the first try, witch makes me think im not getting enough smoke out of it, <br /><br />and after all that effort my lungs are fucked, i cant even smoke a fag without coughing my guts up. <br /><br />over all, well i can defo say WOW but want more out of it, but cant seem to get enough in at once, the smoke is stinky stuff as well, <br /><br />is there an easier way to take it? like snort etc???

And Salvia just seems to encompass nature to me.
