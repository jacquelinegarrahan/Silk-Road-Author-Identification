If it&#039;s been a while you&#039;ll likely have to ween off it for a month in order for MDMA to do much of anything for you- and psychiatrists don&#039;t take kindly to self de-medication. <br /><br />That being said, I got off 225mg of Effexor for my first Ecstasy experience- stopped at the beginning of October and took my molly in November. And Effexor is one of the hardest SNRI/SSRI antidepressants to get off- tons of dizziness, mental haziness and my mind getting stuck in places away from my body before snapping back. Yet it was for the best as I had a fantastic MDMA experience and discontinued Effexor permanently; it was horrid for my anxiety.

				Ah lexapro.&nbsp; Loved it and hated it.&nbsp; Made me feel so much better but gave me limp dick and wasted couple rolls before I found out I couldn&#039;t roll on that stuff.&nbsp; I mean just to let you know, you REALLY can&#039;t and won&#039;t roll at all on this drug.&nbsp; Your going to have to stop use and let it get out of your system completely if you want to roll.

				even higher dose of mdma most likely will not do the trick, either go off anti depressants a few months or choose another substance. Make sure to use extreme caution when stopping use of anti depressants and/or benzos, you can have seizures, go into shock, and DIE from going cold turkey off of some meds, and i am not evening mentioning all the other problems they cause. But mdma imo is a wonder drug, good for the heart and the head. Love &amp; Light

				Sorry babe, You can&#039;t do MDMA and be on SSRIs or MAOIs.. <br /><br />You have to give up on one..&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I know a lot of people are having success with Niacin AKA B3 in place of SSRis in Higher dosages.. Look it up maybe its an alternative for you&nbsp;

				I was on Lexapro years ago. I wasted a bunch of pills because I didn&#039;t know they wouldn&#039;t work. Sucked ass.<br /><br />I really wouldn&#039;t ween yourself off anti-depressant medication just to get high. You&#039;re on the medication for a reason. Sort yourself out first.
