				It is going to cost less money but more effort to extract the DMT.<br />It is going to cost more money but less effort to buy it pre-made.<br />Your decision is how you value your time and labor vs. your money.

				its actually dependent on just how much dmt you are wanting to obtain<br /><br />if you only want a few doses, its definitely cheaper just to buy on SR<br /><br />the entire set up for an extraction cost me about 150 bucks. but then after the first extraction you have everything leftover, so if you want more dmt you just have to buy more mhrb... which can be cheaper than buying already extracted dmt in the long run, but initially costs more especially if only doing it once on a small batch <br /><br />as was mentioned its also the investment of time and effort in addition to needing certain resources not everyone has access or ability to do where they live - not something you can do in a house without everyone knowing whats going on given the fumes and how it wouldnt be safe to do in a bedroom, needing heat and freezer etc<br /><br />there is something remarkably rewarding about seeing the process through from natural form, to doing the chemistry, understanding the actual process, and then obtaining the concentrated alkaloids... when you actually ingest the drug its a different, more connected experience if that makes any sense<br /><br />plus if you get everything you need for a dmt extraction, then you have the resources to extract mescaline from cactus as well
