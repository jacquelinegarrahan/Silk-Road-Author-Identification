				Hello SR, <br /><br />I would like to know if anyone here is experienced with laying blotters with 2c-b.<br />I&#039;m thinking of doing it myself since it&#039;s easier to move and I&#039;ve got 1g laying around anyway.<br /><br />I understand one standard 1/4&quot; tab would hold a subtreshold dose (4-5mg?) but that&#039;s ok for me. <br /><br />Plan is to dissolve the 2c-b, pour the solution into a container, dip a sheet of printed blotter paper (preferrably somewhat bigger/thicker) into it untill it is completely saturated, dry the sheet by evaporation. Probably also wash the container afterwards with a little amount of solvent (2x).<br /><br />Offcourse a good solvent is needed - what alcohol would be best suited: regular labgrade ethanol? <br />Would also like to know the typical solubility of 2c-b (x mg/mL) and the absorption rate of blotter paper. <br /><br />Anyone with more info would be very welcome to share it here :)<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				Ethanol should work well, since 2c-b is very soluble in it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not too well-versed on types of blotter paper, absorbancy, etc.&nbsp; However, you could use other absorbent edible things, like Smarties or other candies, and administer each dose dropwise.&nbsp; Might be a little tedious, but also might be easier to calculate doses and get ahold of supplies.

				I posted a tutorial on this but I can&#039;t find it. <br /><br />I used standard pre-perforated acid size blotter. 2C-B is soluble in alcohol but to lay blotter you need to use the minimum volume of liquid, a little water improves the solubility significantly.<br />1200mg 2C-B.HBr dissolved in warm 70%ipa/ water up to 12mL volume (100mg/ mL), then using 10uL micropipette add 1 drop to each hit, dry under a 60W lamp, then repeat on the reverse of the sheet, then once more, giving a total loading of 3mg/ hit or 12mg per square. This seems to be the maximum loading for blotter, and higher and powder forms on the surface of the blotter. <br /><br />Gammagoblin did some 2C-B blotter at 18mg/ square but the hits were larger than standard blotter.

				I&#039;ve tried that method but there&#039;s no way of telling what the dose of each hit is. There always seems to be residue left behind, the blotter tends to sag in the middle of the solution and the hits on the outer few cm of the paper always seem to be lower dosed. My method is not too tedious, using a Gilson micropipette 200 hits can be done in under 30 minutes and the markup I make on 2C-B blotter more than justifies the time spent accurately dosing.

				no, at 100mg/mL concentration, a 10uL drop contains 1mg. So put one drop on each hit, dry the sheet, then repeat twice more.

				Yeah ebay, it&#039;s a Gilman P20. I think it was about £25 with 100 disposable tips, pretty cheap as the RRP is like £170&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If you were feeling rich &amp; wanted to knock out hundreds of sheets, one of these would be awesome&nbsp; ;D<br />http://www.gilsonuk.com/MLH/PIPETMAN_ConceptMulti/
