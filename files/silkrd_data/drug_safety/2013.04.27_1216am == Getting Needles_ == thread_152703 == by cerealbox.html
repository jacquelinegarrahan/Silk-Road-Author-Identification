				It&#039;s for Ketamine. I can&#039;t snort it, won&#039;t drink it and looking at doses, i&#039;m fairly dubious about the amount I&#039;d have to squirt up my butt (not homophobic, i&#039;ve had past girlfriends who liked my butt, so a little squirt isn&#039;t a big deal for me). I mean, we&#039;re talking wasting nearly a gram to K-hole if I hole in my hole. Only 100 mg intramuscular for the same.<br /><br />So, fuck, I&#039;ma enter the realm of true drug-hood by buying my first needle. Already got the &quot;jewelry&quot; scale.<br /><br />Anyway, where do I get them from? Can I buy some online? If I go to the pharmacy will they be all weirded out? Am I allowed to tell them it&#039;s for drugs if they ask? What kind of needle should I get? Anything I gotta know about? Is there a difference between a needle for K and one for heroin?

				If you look around SR, you should find a couple vendors that carry works.&nbsp; Pharmacare, Hatter26 are just a couple that come to mind.<br /><br />You will probably be looking for 1/2 ml sryinges.&nbsp; Then, look at the safe IM thread somewhere in here.&nbsp; Also, maybe some folks in the Ketamine thread in the rumor mill might have some tips.&nbsp; I don&#039;t IM anything.&nbsp; I just shoot dope and coke.

				Yea on your main page go to &#039;medical&#039; and it has where u can buy packs of rigs.. The pharmacy&#039;s in my state will sometimes try to say &#039;U NEED A PRESCRIPTION SIR&#039; which u dont... And i just say i take B-12 shots and so does my grandma so i need short tip and long tips, i always forget the Gauges , But sometime u have that asshole that wants to make a scene..<br /><br /><br />Bad thing is, just looking by the way i dress and all i wouldnt look like your average &quot;Junkie&quot; But having to wear long sleeve dress shirts to buy needles i can tell they know im covering my track marks, <br /><br />Which when i first started had no idea what i was doing almost 7 years ago, and would always hit the same spot over and over and then just move down some, it ended up leaving til this day almost a 2inch track mark right where docs take blood.. Yep Very Embarrassing..<br /><br />U live and learn..Sorry for the long answer, just fucked up..LOL..<br /><br />MAIN PAGE +MEDICAL = BUYING RIGS..

				There are some clearnet sites to order rigs from, I won&#039;t post them here though. As that other guy said if you search the road a few vedors do sell them if you would prefer that.

				Clearnet basically says they can&#039;t send me anything without a prescription. However, apparently if I just go to the next state, I can walk into a pharmacy, be a 14 year old kid, tell them I&#039;m injecting a large amount of Ketamine and ask them what the best needles are for that and they don&#039;t have to ask for a prescription of anything, they can just give it to me so long as I&#039;m not buying in bulk.<br /><br />On the other hand, silk road stuff seems to all be large amounts of small needles with little variety. The internet seems to think 3cc, 20 gauge syringes that are a bit long cause I&#039;ve packed on the pounds these past few years is best for me. All I can seem to find on the silk road, however, is 1cc, short insulin syringes sold by the 10-pack at least (I don&#039;t need that many).<br /><br />I also want it soon as I&#039;m expecting my K.

				Most of the rigs are like that because they&#039;re resold with opiates in mind. Also, you won&#039;t find much smaller than a 10 pack unless you guy a glass one, that&#039;s the smallest quantity the pharmacies sell. It&#039;s only like 3 bucks for 10 at a pharm.

				I am assuming you&#039;ve already looked into harm reduction programming in your area? Some of them carry a range of needles and can offer you tips and advice on the safest way to IM. It&#039;s a shame if there aren&#039;t any close to you.

				You can get as many needles as you want on amazon for a lot cheaper than on the SR.Order them from amazon.de They have an amazing selection of needles, seringes and wheelfilters on the german amazon and they&#039;re cheap as fuck, $10 for 100 needles.. I&#039;m pretty sure they ship internationally, if not, check out eBay. It&#039;s all in german though but it&#039;s not too hard to figure out how to order something.

				Have you tried NOVARTIS? He has pretty decent prices for medical supplies and I remember getting free needles from him when I ordered a vial of goods. <br /><br />He sells sterile saline vials which you&#039;ll likely want for injecting ketamine. I imagine he&#039;d be more than happy to throw in some needles with a purchase or make a custom order if you just want equipment.

				Makes no sense they would want a perscription, even if you outright told them you wanted for illegal drugs. Would they rather people used dirty unsafe needles?

				Walk in to a pharmacy.. You&#039;re Diabetic.. You need half cc 30gauge insulin needles... somethings wrong with your pump and have been doing self injections lately..... You use novarapid if they ask .:P <br /><br />shouldn&#039;t be a problem... they&#039;ll come in a 10pack bag.

				Locally to me (and I&#039;ll assume this occurs elsewhere) claiming to be diabetic isn&#039;t effective because diabetics receive their equipment from a central organisation and don&#039;t employ pharmacies/drugstores to procure needles. Oddly enough the pharmacies do supply diabetics with insulin.<br /><br />I can vouch for amazon as a good source for small diameter (generally 29 gauge) insuling syringes. Amazon also have small to medium quantities of micropore filters which are useful for removing particulates and bacteria from solutions.<br /><br />Buying injection consumables this is not the most cost effective method, but remains cheap, and saves you having to deal with someone face to face which is handy if you aren&#039;t feeling insouciant enough to make a purchase in person without getting the heebie jeebies.<br /><br />

				Syringes and needles in a variety of gauges are available at medical supply places on clearnet. No scrip required, as syringes (in the US) aren&#039;t a controlled substance. Another alternative is a farm feed and supply, but the downside to that is the smallest needles available would be like 18 ga which would hurt pretty fierce

				18gauge would be brutal.... <br /><br />We buy 31gauge.. Smallest available for a insulin pen..... <br /><br /><br />Sucks how difficult it is to get syringes in the USA..... In Canada you can walk in to a pharmacy and tell em you got some great heroine and need some rigs.... And you&#039;ll get them.. :)

				I&#039;m near a state where you can get needles no questions asked. You can even tell them what it&#039;s for and how much you&#039;re planning on taking and they&#039;re allowed to give you advice on the best needle for the job.<br /><br />Unfortunately the state I&#039;m actually in is one of the most restrictive in the country.<br /><br />I bought mine on the road.
