				Hey Guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the conversion charts, but after hearing some horror stories of Opana&#039;s strength, especially with alcohol and puking, I wanted to get a real life suggestion for my specific case.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been taking Oxycodone for a while - I&#039;ll usually rail 1 30mg roxies with a couple 15mg follow ups over the course of a couple hours no problem for a smooth ride (no crazy euphoria but certainly no sickness ever). I&#039;ve managed to get my hands on some Opana 40mg ERs, and I was wondering what a proper amount would be to insufflate. I&#039;d prefer not to puke, but hopefully enough for me to feel a decent euphoria.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard good things about plugging, but I&#039;d prefer to stay away from that for a while. I might try Nomad Bloodbath&#039;s IV method at some point in the future, but I wanted to snort first to get my Opana doses right first.<br /><br />Thanks guys, really appreciate it. Stay safe out there.

				Do not mix alcohol with oxymorphone.<br /><br /><br />5mg of oxymorphone will have you going for 5 hours hard.

				I&#039;ve heard of some people taking shots of liquor before hand when they take oxymorphone orally to increase the bioavailability, but both for safety and because I want to snort them, I definitely won&#039;t be doing that.<br /><br />Do you have any suggestions of how the doses carry over when you&#039;re dealing with intranasal?

				If you&#039;re gonna snort oxymorphone start with 5mg.<br /><br />Crush it up into two piles of powder.<br />2.5mg per line, 1 up each side of your nose.

				Don&#039;t forget to eat a high fat meal about 20 minutes before snorting. It will increase your effects by about 20 percent. sometimes more, sometimes less. For me, its right around 20 percent increase.... Its almost like taking alcohol without the dangers. It keeps your liver busy so it cant break down the oxymorphone. (thats the non technical version)

				Well, when you do IV your bioavailability is 100 percent, so of course, there is no reason to eat a high fat meal. Its only relevant to those that im, snort or heaven forbid, eat.

				I just want to say be very very careful.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just got a 40mg Opana ER yesterday to play around with.&nbsp; I normally do 15-30 mg roxi (snorting or under the tongue) and feel great.&nbsp; I have a descent tolerance I think by doing about 40mg hydro orally on a daily basis over the last two years, with the roxi on the side.&nbsp; However, after snorting less than a quarter of the Opana, like maybe 8-9mg, I was not only completely sedated such that I could not, literally, keep my eyes open, but I was more nauseous than I think I have ever been in my entire life.&nbsp; I threw up 4 times over the course of 8 hours and had a horrible trip.&nbsp; I could not believe Opana is that much stronger than the roxi&#039;s, but it totally kicked my ass.&nbsp; It has been about 18 hours since I first took it and I am still feeling sick.<br /><br />I wonder if anybody else has had effects such as this?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The nausea is the first sign of a mild overdose. The repeated vomiting was your body reacting to trying to get the opiate out of your system but it was too later it had been absorbed into your bloodstream and there is no way of getting that out via vomiting.<br /><br />I very much had the same reaction one time when I use to shoot heroin. I dosed up my first shot and didnt get the immediately effects i wanted so i cooked up a second shot...this was a mistake because for the next 4-5 hours i was vomiting/dry heaving every 20 minutes.<br /><br />Too Much Too Fast.<br /><br />nomad bloodbath

				Nomad is correct, you just did too much. A lot of first timers will underestimate the strength of opana and since they have to snort half an 80mg oxy they assume they have to snort half an opana...If you take too much of any narcotic you will either be puking your guts out or stop breathing.<br /><br />Next time, cut your dosage by about 70 to 80&nbsp; percent, then if that doesn&#039;t do it, slowly add more, wait 10 minutes, rinse and repeat. You can always add more but you cannot take any away...<br /><br />oxymorphone must be handled with care...

				id recommend starting out with a much lower dose then you think you need with a new opiate/opioid, not only because of the obvious safety issues but ive found easing in drastically reduces nasuea.<br />in my experience having very small to small doses afew times before a proper &#039;nod off&#039; type dose can reduce sickness during or after.
