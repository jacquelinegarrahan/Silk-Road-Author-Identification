				so, let&#039;s say someone has been taking a regular dose 10mg of ambien like....EVERY night for the last two years? they&#039;ve taken breaks and stuff over this time period, but for the most part, almost every night. bad?<br /><br />let&#039;s just say this person lives with someone who is sort of unstable, and while sometimes they can be generous and calm, they have a habit of lashing out verbally making life a living hell, thus making the aforementioned count their minutes everyday for the night to come so they can pop that sweet coma inducing ambrosia.<br /><br />and hypothetically, let&#039;s say this is written by a 34 year old who lives with a family member, has no job, no local friends, no relationship, because he is so withdrawn and depressed from more than two decades of existing in a miserable living environment and...blahblahblah....i forget what i was rambling about, took my ambien when i started,..god damnit....i feel like i&#039;ve been infected with stupid from these jacked up people i&#039;m surrounded by. i need to find a way out of this fucking house and city.......for the love of god. but knowing my luck i&#039;ll end up jumping from the frying pan into the fire.<br /><br />

				i dont even remember writing that^<br /><br />was drinking too. i should quit this drug. if only i could score a little pot.<br /><br />how did it fuck you up, if you dont mind me asking? <br /><br />i constantly wonder what sort of effect this shit will have on me long term. i do the weirdest fucking shit ever on this stuff. unlike any other substance illicit or legal. taking a shower at the coldest setting and challenging the coldness and fighting the water? what the flying fuck??? painting my hands with black sharpie and stamping the walls? double what the flying fuck.
