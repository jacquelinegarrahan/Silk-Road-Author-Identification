				I read that oxycontin and opana are no longer crushable. Does anyone know which opiate pills are still crushable?&nbsp; Are the Oxycontin OP&#039;s the only type of Oxys that aren&#039;t crushable?

				I&#039;m pretty sure most prescription opiates are still crushable. I only knew about OP&#039;s being crushproof, and I guess opana&#039;s now if you say so. I&#039;d look into hydromorphone(dilaudid) if you want to snort/bang a painkiller. Snorting it is much more efficient than swallowing, and IV&#039;ing is WAYYY more efficient(not sure which one you&#039;re into... I got me a little hydromorphone coming soon and that shit&#039;s definitely going in the pin.

				Thanks for the info - I am actually intending to buy some dilaudids from SR in the next couple days - if you know of any good vendors let me know!&nbsp; I usually snort them but always lose some because not all of it gets absorbed up my nose.&nbsp; A friend told me to hold a wet napkin in my nostril but that didn&#039;t seem to work?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure injecting it is best but that&#039;s just not my thing.

				Opana&#039;s can be ground into a fine powder using a dremel tool and are apparently fantastic when u do so (I do not know if this powder is soluble for injection though, I don&#039;t shoot, but do know they are apparently great for snorting).&nbsp; I look forward to finding out for myself soon :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t take credit for this idea, thank you RxKing ;)

They are new, but getting good feedback, and it got to me really fast from really far away. Since they&#039;re new and not busy your order would go out right away.

				There are ways of getting around the anti-abuse pills for IV, but that&#039;s not your thing.
