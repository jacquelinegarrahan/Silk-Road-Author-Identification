				Last weekend I started messing around with DMT for the first time. After reading some posts by other members on here I decided to start out slow. I started by loading 30mg on a bed of tobacco (yuck) into my bong and gave it a shot. It wasnt a good experience at all as the smoke was so harsh I couldnt hold the smoke in for all but a second or two, but I think this was compounded by me just getting over some nasty summer flu. The end result was me coughing and spewing phlegm all over the place for atleast a minute. The only effects I felt was a very mild body high that lasted around 10 minutes or so. After that experience I decided that I would give it a couple more days and beat this flu before giving another attempt. <br /><br />A few days passed and I felt the urge to give it another shot. This time I loaded the same dose, around 30mg, into my volcano vaporizer and filled up a bag. The smoke was so clean compared to my previous experience and got a good four hits in before I started to feel the effects. It started with a creeping body high that felt like it just continued to climb until I was totally couch locked and fairly incapacitated. It was not a breakthrough or ego death experience, but a good 20 minute trip with a great body high and minor visuals. I had a blast and Im looking forward to experimenting with higher doses, but since that trip I have noticed something very different with my sleep cycles, I am having more vivid dreams and actually remembering them to the detail when I wake up. I usually never remember my dreams, if Im lucky Im able to remember maybe one per month, but the last few days I have been finding myself waking up from them semi-astonished to find that Im just laying in my bed and I am able to recall each dream to the detail. I am kind of blown away by this change since I dont think I have dreamed this vividly since childhood, and I was wondering if anyone else has had similar effects after using DMT?

Ive done DMT quite some times and it either worked or it didnt. I never had minor visuals. The comedown maybe let me have visuals which were a distortion of our reality (really strong ones) but the trip itself always made my reality crumble away and reach the &#039;door&#039; and sometimes get trough the door and find the entity&#039;s. These were always visuals which had nothing to do with the &#039;normal&#039; world we live in. Crazy stuff :) Read up on the DMT machine and get a good trip mate, you will be amazed!

				DMT seems like hit or miss type of drug.&nbsp; Some people will have great break-through and get launched into hyperspace with crazy entities and visions.&nbsp; For some people, they will just have some body/visual buzz.&nbsp; I personally never had true DMT experience as people describe.&nbsp; I either blacked out or just had mild visual hallucinations.

				I was going to say the same thing as FartBomber, 30mg of DMT with &quot;minor visuals&quot; is not right at all. That amount may not send you into an alternate dimension where you encounter entities, but to only achieve minor visuals makes me wonder if either you didn&#039;t get a good hit, or the vaporizer burnt some instead of properly vaporizing, or perhaps you have 5-meo-dmt instead of n-n-dmt.<br /><br />20-30mg of DMT should have you seeing visuals like 800+ ug of LSD. Everything is patterns within patterns, constantly moving.

				I haven&#039;t experienced it myself, but I&#039;ve seen others say they get vivid dreams after using DMT. Hopefully that is a good sign that you have N-N-DMT and not 5-MEO-DMT.

It melts at a very low temperature, which makes it start to run/drip, if you don&#039;t get it heated to vaporization temperatures before it drips you&#039;ll just end up losing the DMT in your pipe. If you do it too fast you&#039;ll pyrolyze it, and it will taste absolutely awful and even if you can manage to hold in the extremely harsh vapor, you&#039;ll get minimal effects.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you can accurately compare any dose of LSD and DMT. I only get &quot;geometric/fractal&quot; patterns on DMT on sub-breakthrough or on the comeup/comedown. If I actually properly vape 30mg, its as if i&#039;ve never seen anything before. LSD&#039;s visuals are far more harsh fractal lines. DMT&#039;s breakthrough visuals are usually soft, hyper-realistic, and utterly infinite almost as if your looking at Jupiter, and every spec of dust between earth and Jupiter in perfectly clear focus.

				I&#039;ve yet to have a breakthrough, but I get an intense chrysanthemum experience all the time... that&#039;s using GVG @40mg, but I definitely don&#039;t hit all of it.&nbsp; There is definitely a learning curve to vapeing this stuff efficiently.&nbsp; I think the Machine will get you the most bang for your buck, it just feels so ghetto smoking out of.&nbsp; The one time I did hit the machine though I definitely was like || close to fully breaking through, I only took one hit though and thought I was going to black out so I just laid back, and it was just barely on the teetering point I&#039;m pretty sure.<br /><br />Oh, and DMT at low doses seems to be a great hangover cure.&nbsp; Got home Sunday last weekend with a massive headache, hit the DMT and felt like brand new all night.
