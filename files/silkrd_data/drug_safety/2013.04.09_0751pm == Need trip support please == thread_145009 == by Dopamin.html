				Hey,<br /><br />I am trying to work through some traumatic childhood experiences with the help of MDMA. Basically I was neglected and mistreated by my parents. That lead to big social problems in my childhood. I never had real friends until recent times and I have overcome my 30 year long depression. Allthough I feel I have not completed that work yet. I found new interests in life, I do a lot of sports and I have women in my life.<br /><br />What I am asking for is some empathic help if my trip goes in a wrong direction. I can&#039;t really speak with anyone about this issues in the real world because so many people have experienced the same as I have. And they would burn themselves before they would touch those locked up experiences.<br /><br />So, if anyone of you has some spare time I would really appreciate that. I know I have to travel this road 95% by myself but anyway, if you could support me a bit, that would be really cool.<br /><br />I dropped 140mg acetone washed mdma, might be like 120mg pure stuff. I am at<br /><br /><br />0:16 now :)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				thanks kappacino,<br /><br />I am reading a book on how to cure my inner child at the moment. I found in my previous MDMA experiences that just listening deeply inside myself resolved a lot of my problems. Maybe I will go out on MDMA one day and enjoy the fruit of my work ;)

				+1:15 coming up now<br /><br />i know now why I did MDMA today. it was just so painful to realize what happened to me. It was a strong, physical pain I felt. I went uphill running to subside it, that was&nbsp; a crutch. I have to learn to feel anger and wrath my parents for what they did to me. then i will be free. I have to relive the pain I felt. And I think I have to do that without drugs.

				anger isn&#039;t going to help.&nbsp; you need to move to a state where you can recognise that they&#039;re human and they failed you, that you have survived them and can move on.&nbsp; Anger will just keep fanning the flames and you&#039;ll never let go.

				omg, i just realized how badly I fucked up most of my life. I am really on the edge, and if I dont find a job soon I will be in trouble. Somehow I managed to be blind for a very long time, and did not realize that I am just a loudmouth. Tough stuff. But, oh well, that was maybe what I spent my last year on: to realize that i have to get my shit together. at any cost. Holy, that sounds rough...<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the support guys. I will try to get some sleep now.
