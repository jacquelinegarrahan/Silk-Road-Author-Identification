				Just eat the darn thing.&nbsp; The bio availability is higher, and smoking pills on foil is incredibly wasteful and tastes like shit.

				100 percent can.<br /><br />Smoking oc is very popular in my area alot of the kids have habits. <br /><br />The best way to do it is attach it to a piece of aluminum foil by simply heating the back of the pill.

				You can smoke OCs from foil, but only without any APAP. Ie, not the smaller dosage pills that also have acetaminophen. If you want, you can go through the process of cold water extraction to filter out the APAP, but it&#039;s much easier to just eat them if they also contain the APAP.

				Dont waste any oxycodone. Just crush it up and sniff it. If you have 5 or 6 5mg PURE oxys crush em all and sniff em in a nice fat line. You&#039;ll thank me later.

				Apparently you can, but it sounds like it would be better to just snort it or take it orally. ;)

				Smoking oxys isn&#039;t a smart idea unless there&#039;s no acetaminophen at all in it. If it&#039;s a 5 mg pill, then there&#039;s probably that apap shit in there. I would recommend just eating the thing, unless you wanna do that cold water extraction shit. Which takes too long unless you have 5mg pills in bulk.

				you can get straight 5&#039;s with no apap here, I&#039;d crush them all if you have multiples, snort a&nbsp; bit and eat the rest of the powder, I like the taste of the powder :D&nbsp; that way you get the more instant hit from the snorting and the rest of it orally helps with the duration<br /><br />
