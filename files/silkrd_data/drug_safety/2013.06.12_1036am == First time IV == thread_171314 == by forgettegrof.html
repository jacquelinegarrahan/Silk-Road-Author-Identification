				Dog..<br /><br />That stuff is wicked fucking strong.&nbsp; WHY did you order it if you have never shot up before.&nbsp; AND!!!&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t already, don&#039;t fucking start now.<br /><br />BUT!!<br /><br />Since you have ordered it, and Hatter WILL get it to you fast (I can vouch for many a quick pack from dude), then you should consider plugging.&nbsp; I can almost guarantee, 40 units of that cold shoot IV will have you laid the fuck out if you don&#039;t have a tolerance.<br /><br />My g/f says to add:&nbsp; If you are gonna shoot that, make sure someone is around to lift your head so you don&#039;t aspirate any snot or vomit if you fall out.<br /><br />How does she know this?&nbsp; She has done it for me, on the exact same stuff you just bought.&nbsp; I thought I was a big man, and tried to do the whole thing in less then a day.&nbsp; And I have somewhat of a tolerance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Edited for spelling errors)

				If you really want to do that IV (I highly suggest you don&#039;t given that you don&#039;t have tolerance at all and if you survive it will turn you into an addict in less than a day, but I also know that when you want to do a thing it&#039;s futile to say &quot;don&#039;t do it&quot;) I would not got over 20 units in your case. This is not a joke.<br /><br />Have someone with you then, PLEASE, in case you will go in trouble. If you must do it alone then get some naloxone, but in any case don&#039;t do more than 30 units or you will not even be able to inject it in case (you will simply blackout with the syringe in the arm and bye bye).<br /><br />EDIT: For the ones above saying 40/50 units, THAT&#039;S TOO MUCH FOR IV (for plugging yes, but not for IV), he doesn&#039;t have ANY tolerance (neither to other opiates). That thing is extremely strong for a first time. It also depends on weight, naturally, but in his case I would not go above 30 units; 20 will give a very good high with no troubles (apart the addiction extreme high probability after, that&#039;s naturally a great trouble in itself, but not of the same nature; always better than dying without either understanding it).

				I&#039;m sure if you ask the vendor really nicely, he can lead you in the right direction probably better then most here.&nbsp; He can be busy, but he is big on harm reduction and if he has the time it shouldn&#039;t be a big deal.<br /><br /><br />I should add, you could probably get away with dripping it down your nasal passage via syringe (With no pin, of course) if you were to lay on your back and tilt your head back over the side of your bed or whatever.<br />

				Hi, I believe Hatters stuff is at least micron filtered (cold, the only way it should ever be) several times. If you are a first timer please do not IV, there is an alternative similar in effect to snorting but as potent as IV&#039;ing, and that is Subcutaneous Injection (into the fatty tissue, like a diabetic does Insulin), you do no more then 10mg to start with in a sterile Insulin Syringe into a Fatty area like the Stomach or Thighs after a good wipe down with alcohol pad to clean the skin. Wait at least 10 minutes before doing more and keep the dose low since it will accumulate. As long as the Dope has been Micron filtered and only a sterile Syringes are used on alcohol swabbed skin then no worry about an abscess etc. The advantage is it introduces you to the drug, but without the Super Addictive rush. If you want to go that direction later then so-be-it but at least you haven&#039;t OD&#039;ed right off...<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />mushmold<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171314.msg1226636#msg1226636">Quote from: forgettegrof on June 12, 2013, 10:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I recently ordered http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d74709b7e3 I&#039;ve never IV&#039;d before and my tolerance is nil.

				This thread is full of posers.<br /><br />Tie off, find a juicy vein and don&#039;t shoot more than 25mgs or in your case a 10th of the bag. <br /><br />Once you know you can handle it keep going. You&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />I smoke quarter g&#039;s plus with no tolerance in less than 8 hours no prob. <br /><br />Just make sure you know how to use a needle.
