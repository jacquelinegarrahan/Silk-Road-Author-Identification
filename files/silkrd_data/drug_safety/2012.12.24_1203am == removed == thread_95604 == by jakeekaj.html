Even people with addictions can be smart. Not every stereotype is true. Personally I know no crack heads, but know a couple of smack heads. The ones I know (and I know this is not true for every smack head out there) are smart, caring and have a job to pay for this habit. To just say that they are piece of shits says a fuck load more about you then about them.

But you can change the vibes. freaking out? put on some chill music. <br />if you want spiritual do it alone in a forest. <br />change the world around you, change the incoming signals. that is the only way to have some control.<br /><br />if you get into a situation where just spiraling into a bad freak out zone&nbsp; the best thing you can do is sing. thats a good way to influence a trip.<br /><br />i once had a terrible come up and the whole thing was going bad. what did i do? i sang. and the world turned around.
