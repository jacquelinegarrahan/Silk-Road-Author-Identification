				Well last night some friends came over with some shrooms and I was pretty excited because I haven&#039;t had shrooms in over a month. I am sensitive when it comes to psychedelics so a little bit is a lot for me so I found my sweet spot with shrooms at 1.5g of regular dried cubensis. I weighed out everyone&#039;s dose (most people doing 3.5g) and then turned into a tea. I normally feel shroom tea within 10 minutes of ingesting it but I only had a mild body high and some enhanced vision, only one person was fully tripping and my two other friends were on the same level as me. Anyway, we waited an hour and we were still on the same level so we ate some more (I ate another 1.5g so 3g in total) and right after I ate them I began to trip on the shroom tea full on. I started enjoying the visuals until about 30 minutes later the other 1.5g hit me hard and it was too much for me to handle and started spiraling down into a bad trip. I can&#039;t really explain it much without sounding crazy but I could see myself as a human being for the first time and was freaking out about it, I couldn&#039;t look at my hands without freaking out, it was as if I was observing myself third person like in a video game. I began to have an anxiety attack for about an hour straight but I didn&#039;t want to worry my friends so I just kept rolling with it until it got to the point where I needed medical attention. <br /><br />Normally I would have xanax on hand but I was completely out and the only thing I had were amphetamines so I was all alone in dealing with it. Finally my good friend came to the rescue with a big bottle of vodka and made me a really strong drink and I started downing it and oh sweet jesus I came down and was pretty drunk but feeling good. The shrooms/alcohol wore off at about 7am and we went to get breakfast and I have never felt better in my life. I felt a lot stronger mentally and really feel like my psyche is grounded now, I probably won&#039;t be taking shrooms for a while and will stick to my good friends 2c-i/LSD. Anyway, here are some tips for anyone that is going to be taking a psychedelic.<br /><br />-Always have a benzo on hand or alcohol, I normally do but assumed I would be okay, bad mistake.<br />-Don&#039;t over think things, I spiraled out of control by over thinking how many shrooms I consumed instead of just enjoying the trip.<br />-Always be around good friends, I couldn&#039;t have imagined going through this experience with strangers or at a party.<br />-Dose correctly, I have been doing psychs for years now and have never really needed to go higher up in my doses.<br />-Always remember that it&#039;s all in your mind, relax, focus on your breathing and tell yourself that you took a psychedelic and it will wear off and you will be okay.<br />-Don&#039;t let it traumatize you, everyone will have a difficult trip at some point but you can&#039;t let one stop you from continuing exploring/enjoying psychedelics. <br />-Know your boundaries, I can&#039;t smoke weed while doing a psychedelic, it&#039;s very common for people to enjoy cannabis while tripping or coming down from a psychedelic but personally it gives me bad anxiety, just because everyone does something doesn&#039;t mean you have to. Everyone has different boundaries so find what yours are and respect them.<br />

				Sorry to hear about your bad experience mate. I get what you mean about looking at yourself and getting freaked out. I was the same when I looked in the mirror whilst I was on MXE. <br /><br />I did acid for the first time last week... overall it was quite a pleasant experience. Wouldn&#039;t do it again though because it didn&#039;t &#039;put&#039; me in a good mood. I felt as though I had to earn my euphoria by putting myself in a good mood. If you get what I mean? I&#039;ve read about this on a few forums... with psychedelics you have to put yourself in the right setting etc...<br /><br />I&#039;ll just stick with my MDMA/drone. They always treat me well... I like how my mood is instantly lifted rather than me getting myself there. <br /><br />I agree, a benzo is always a good idea... I always have Valium (Diazepam) handy when ever I&#039;m taking anything.

				shrooms can easily be just as, if not more, intense than other psychedelics, especially when comparing a low dose of shrooms (1.75 g) to a low dose of 2ci (20 mg)... personally I experience much stronger psychedelic effects from shrooms. <br /><br />If one was to take 40 mg of 2c-i then of course its going to be more intense than a lower dose of shrooms<br /><br />Sorry to hear you had a bad trip Delta11, glad you were able to work your way through it and appreciate the aftereffects

I don&#039;t know what it is, but I have a really hard time getting a meaningful trip on the 2c family. I&#039;ve had one really profound trip on a relatively low 2c-e dose out of 5 or 6. I don&#039;t love them any less - 2c-b is my favorite &quot;fun&quot; drug. But you can&#039;t beat the tryptamines for deep experiences. IMO at least.

				I tripped on some of Rockers shrooms this past Saturday and my friend I expected to need to calm down etc but he handled it quite well until he disappeared into a room for 15mins or so (felt longer, but you know) and came out overwhelmed and thinking he was puking but was really just spitting.<br /><br />I calmed him down and introduced him to what I enjoy doing on shrooms now, which is turning on music and just focusing on HD Wallpaper, focusing on it and twisting it with my mind, ie branches on a beach scene becoming fragments and patterns eventually turning into a weird looking cartoon cat and I&#039;d laugh and reset my focus, turning it back into the beach scene and amazed at how that progressed.<br /><br />It&#039;s pure entertainment for me, like watching a movie, and I think that&#039;s the difference for me and others who freak out, it&#039;s usually people that already have anxiety issues that freak out.

				On Friday I ate 1 gram of Rockers Cubensis, with some walnuts to mask the taste. In one hour I felt enhanced vision and some hallucination, after 3 hours I wasn&#039;t fully tripping, and I thought maybe the does was just too little. I smoked some weed and sat in front on the television, and that&#039;s when the trip came full on. <br />So, maybe I&#039;ll stay with my low doses of shrooms and smoke some weed :D
