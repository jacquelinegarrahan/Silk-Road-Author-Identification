				Shrooms would be a good starting point, but I won&#039;t ever take shrooms again.&nbsp; After the 4th time I realized it&#039;s always the same trip.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t getting anything new from the experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ecstasy is also a good intro into psychedelics... but if you want to know the truth, the best psychedelics out there are LSD and 2ci.&nbsp; LSD is the best drug out there though, and I&#039;ve sampled a lot of them.&nbsp; When you do decide to do a psychedelic, here&#039;s a list of things you&#039;ll want to consider doing.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />If you did even 1/4 of the things on here, you&#039;d have the best trip ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Walking, being outside in nature...go for a hike or go camping.&nbsp; Stare at the Moon.<br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though. <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Concert or Rave<br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it. <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!! <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good. <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to. <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other.<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt. <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.) <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off. <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself) <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museaum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining. <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer?&nbsp; I’m told this is cool on Acid but I have yet to try it, lots of people recommend it. <br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid. <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br /><br />

				What about DMT or Salvia, they are very powerful, but at least they aren&#039;t 12 hour trips lol. I was actually had the same question and have some DMT and was wondering if that would be a goof first psychedelic to try as my first one.

				If you plan on Smoking DMT, make sure you have an experienced shaman/tripper.&nbsp; The person must feel comfortable leaving his/her reality.&nbsp; Personally is a very difficult task to master.

				mescaline, DMT, acid or mushrooms are really the only &quot;full&quot; psychedelic experiences IMO, everything else I&#039;ve seen or tried was just one component of one of the above but missing something else that makes the experience what it is.<br /><br />I&#039;d say acid/shrooms are the easiest to find, shrooms especially but I&#039;d honestly say acid.&nbsp; It was my first psy and was quite a bit easier to handle than I thought it&#039;d be.

				Mescaline is gentle and euphoric but somewhat physically stimulating. DMT is pretty gentle in a way but very powerful. I&#039;d suggest either of those starting with a light dose.

				I started with 2C-B and I recommend it to everyone. I definitely wouldn&#039;t choose mushrooms as my starting psychedelic, but that&#039;s just me... I love mushrooms now, but I think it would have been way too much for my first time. A low dose of 2C-B is very mild, it really gently prepares you for more intense psychedelics and it&#039;s fun as hell.

				DMT if you want to jump in at the deep end, 2cb is a great starting place, things get very tactile and you have a great psychedelic headspace but without the introspection of LSD. LSD can be too much as a starter place; same with shrooms. people can suffer nausea from shrooms.<br /><br />remember your own set and setting!!

				I would go for the lowest dose of it and you can always take more if you are liking it.<br /><br />Salvia was my first psychedelic and I don&#039;t really recommend it... It scared me, as I took a huge hit of the strongest extract there is and seconds later I completely forgot what was going on as the scenery melted into a cartoon world. Fortunately Salvia is very short lasting and a couple minutes later I was back to normal, yet not the same as I was before, as I had just witnessed the most extreme psychedelic visuals I ever had. I have yet to try DMT to compare, but after doing Salvia a second time with similar results, I would believe DMT to be a nicer drug.<br /><br />I recommend cubensis shrooms. Not Aminita (very scary trips unless experienced.. and even then...), or any really potent mushroom which will give you a lot of hallucinations. Cubensis keeps you totally sane and you wont ever loose control. You know exactly what is going on while experiencing the effects of your dilated pupils (light blurs etc), closed eye visuals, and clearer thoughts and understanding. People can and do see hallucinations on cubensis but not everyone does, it depends on the setting (dim lights/dusk helps) and the dosage/your tolerance to it.<br /><br />Trip safe, hope you have fun!

				If you are not sure just take 60 and then redose another 60 after 40 - 60 mins. The best way would be sublingual and empty stomach.

Salvia can be incredibly frightening, or very beautiful, you need a relationship with the plant itself and I do NOT recommend salvia for initiates to the psychedelic realms.<br /><br />2. Breakthrough level DMT cost me a pipe I&#039;d had for years, two disc screen bowls, and some 25i. I wasn&#039;t ready, and it was honestly scarier than my salvia breakthroughs, which were scary as fuck. I do NOT recommend breakthrough DMT for the initiate either, not unless you&#039;re guided by an experienced shaman. Sub-breakthrough is great though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Listen to this guy, he knows what he is talking about...DMT is beautiful...but without guidance it can seriously freak people out.

				low dose of lsd or mushrooms would be a great introduction to the psychedelic state and won&#039;t overwhelm you too much. my advice is: stick to the classics until you are more experienced.

				Honestly...i started psychedelics with mushrooms... you will get a pretty good understanding what changes take place in your mind...if you wanna break all boundaries and jump into the deep in, load up 50mg of DMT and vaporize that shit.&nbsp; Just be ready to embark on another reality.
