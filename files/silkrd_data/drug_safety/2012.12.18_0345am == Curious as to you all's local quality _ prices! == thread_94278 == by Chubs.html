				So, as the subject states... I&#039;m interested to see what you guys pay for your street drugs on average... Hopefully this isn&#039;t against any rules or anything.<br /><br />Southeast USA:<br /><br />Coke: Quality varies price 50-60/g my main supplier does pretty decent shit (and I have had tested and verified 78% pure cocaine, so I&#039;ve had a good reference) my best connect since I&#039;m not a frequent buyer is mostly nice consistant rocky powder, with half large chunks, half chunky crystally powder (if that makes sense)<br />MDMA: Shitty to average, 10-15 a point, 50-80 grams.<br />Pressies (Rolls): Shitty, mostly pipes and RC&#039;s because dubstep kids have no idea what MDMA actually feels like, in fact, I gave someone a dutch import and they claimed it wasn&#039;t good as an outpressed glock they had (pipe/amp combo LOL)... Prices: 5-15 a pop<br />Meth: Never seen it, heard it&#039;s def around in bulk though<br />Opiates: Don&#039;t mess with em<br />Dexedrine/Amp&#039;s: 1-3 a pill<br />Benzos: Don&#039;t mess with, know people with 1-5 a piece.<br />DMT: 10 a dose<br />LSD: Small circles around here have legit shit, estimated by me at maybe 100ish ug, lot&#039;s of bunk RC&#039;s going around though.<br />Shrooms: very good quality, large supplier around here... 100-160 a zip.<br />Weed: Haven&#039;t seen reggies in a longgg time but I was paying 60-100 an ounce, weed here is very good, and often times I have selections, but being a bulk purveyor myself, I don&#039;t have a price to compare to ;D<br />Heroin: No idea, hear rumors there is a majorrrrr op about 45 min from me, from a reliable source.<br />RCs: I hate RC kids, so fuck if I know.<br /><br />I know a lot of people, so generally I have access to much better quality than most people get, but we all know street stuff is garbage.<br /><br />SOOOO What you guys paying around your area?<br />

				I don&#039;t have many connections IRL, as most of my business goes to the SR, so most of this will be anecdotal stuff I heard from friends who can&#039;t be arsed to get their shit online.<br /><br />Location: middle of east-coast, USA<br /><br />Coke: I don&#039;t mess with it, but it&nbsp; is usually 60 bucks a gram. The only people I know who really do it are members of an all-boys college who are notorious for being rich coke-fiends, and from what I hear the coke they get is alright but not too good.<br /><br />MDMA: Most of the MDMA around here is actually Methylone, which I enjoy but is significantly weak in comparison to legitimate MDMA. However, if I want real MDMA I can drive an hour and get it for 20 a point.<br /><br />Pressies (Rolls): 15 a pop, usually something like mephedrone. For some reason I&#039;ve seen a lot of rolls with mephedrone in them. Kids love them, but they don&#039;t know shit about their drugs. I can absolutely attest to Chubs&#039; claim that kids around prefer amp combos or other RC&#039;s to actual MDMA. No one wants that MDMA magic anymore. In fact, the people I&#039;ve sold methylone too have commended it saying they liked it because it just made them chatty and not all touchy-feely like MDMA usually does.<br /><br />Meth: I live in a smaller area, so meth is definitely prominent. Never really done it or been around it that much, though. I did used to know one tweaker who wanted to buy amphetamine off me, but I don&#039;t think he mentioned a price.<br /><br />Opiates: Standard prices. Have never seen heroin around here, although I know it is. Since I&#039;m only in college, though, that could be a reason. 5 mg hydros go for 3 bucks a pop and the norco-10s go for 5 or 6 depending on where you&#039;re getting them. Oxy goes for a dollar a miligram, as usual. Haven&#039;t seen tramadol or opana or dilaudid around, but I&#039;m sure you can find it if you look hard enough.<br /><br />Dexedrine/Amp&#039;s: College town, so amps are everywhere. Never seen legitimate dexedrine, but 20/30 mg amphetamine salts go for 5 bucks as well as 70 mg vyvanses. The vyvanse is hard to find, though. Concerta is pretty prevalent, but the dosages are small.<br /><br />Benzos: Xanny&#039;s are hard to find but klonopin is usually in good supply. 3 bucks a pop, don&#039;t know mg&#039;s because klonopin has always just made me nauseous and I don&#039;t fuck with it.<br /><br />DMT: Extremely rare. Contemplated making it myself. I have looked at this as a business opportunity in my area before because I&#039;ve talked to people about it and they are more than willing to pay 20 - 25 dollars for a &#039;breakthrough&#039; dose of 50 - 60 mgs.<br /><br />LSD: 10 bucks a hit of around 90 - 100 ugs, not very prevalent. 70 bucks for a ten strip.<br /><br />Shrooms: Hard to find, as with most psychedelics that aren&#039;t RC&#039;s, 45 a quarter.<br /><br />Weed: 10 a gram for shit weed and 20 a gram for alright weed. Everyone says they have &#039;the best chron&#039; but unless I drive to the nearest large city I don&#039;t get good weed. Not that I smoke much, so it doesn&#039;t hurt me. <br /><br />Heroin: No clue. I&#039;ve never known anybody to do heroin, since the only opis around here are scripts. <br /><br />RCs: RC&#039;s have a pretty good market here, and I sell them around when I have them in stock. Never bullshit anybody with them, though. Since psychedelics and empathogens that aren&#039;t shit are lacking here, I mostly find people looking for M1, or 2cs. I&#039;ve sold methylone, 2c-e, 2c-i, and then 25i when the NBOMe&#039;s got popular. I sold the NBOMe at 10 a hit and got pretty good business with them, just because of the lack of supply of anything else. I didn&#039;t like to deal with the 2c&#039;s because I don&#039;t have a miligram scale, so when I sold them I took them to my buddy who does and paid him some money to cap them up for me. Sold 2-ce at 20 for a good oral dose. 2c-i for the same. Again, moderate business. Methylone was extremely popular, sold for 15 a point, and my business booms whenever I get it. People love it. I enjoy it myself, too, so it&#039;s always nice to have it in stock. I like it I have a tendency to binge when I do drugs and methylone feels a bit less harsh to binge for a day or so on than legitimate MDMA.

				Denmark:<br /><br />Coke: Is all shit here - people tell u its 70% pure or higher but its never past 50 and street shit is 10-20 - about 80-100$ a gram of street shit or 200$ for something better.<br />MDMA: 100-150$ a gram - dont know about quality.<br />Ketamin: Is about same price as MDMA.<br />Heroin: Not sure but iam told 50$ per 0.1 gram on the streets.<br />Weed: 12$ a gram.<br />Hash: We have a huge market and a huge demand of hash around here and the selection is very wide - Low quality hash can go for as little as 1$ and good quality as high as 20$ or more -&nbsp; Personal ive set my max at 10$ a gram wich is the highest amount i wanna pay and i only smoke the best they got.. But this said ive been a regular customer for years and most people pay alot more.<br />LSD: Its been 10 years since my first trip so dont know about todays prices but back then i think it was 10 or 20$ for a hit

				Midwest US<br /><br />Coke:&nbsp; Don&#039;t mess w/ it, but from hanging out w/ kids who do it&#039;s $50-90/g based on quality.&nbsp; Product at the higher end is extremely pure as far as I can tell from looking at it - very shimmery scales, and the people involved in it aren&#039;t anything small time.<br /><br />MDMA: 15-20/pt 80-120/g - when it&#039;s not M1 or another RC, it&#039;s VERY high quality that comes from trusted vendors on here :)<br /><br />Rolls: Pretty sparse, but when SR moon rocks weren&#039;t coming in on the regular they were great quality and $10-20/each $600-700 for jars, and about $4k for boats<br /><br />Herb: Only know people w/ premium quality, so no clue on mid/shwag prices.&nbsp; $60/8th $100/q $180/half $350/z $1000-1200/qp $3200-$4000/lb<br /><br />Concentrates:&nbsp; Full melt bubble for $20-30 when it&#039;s around, but most kids have been going dab-crazy.&nbsp; High quality butane and CO2 oil goes for $40-70/g generally, and when quantity comes in it&#039;s around $500-700/oz<br /><br />LSD:&nbsp; LOTS of RCs floating around, so the price on real deal has skyrocketed in the past year.&nbsp; Singles are almost always $10 or more, strips for $70-80, sheets for $500+.&nbsp; Definitely miss the days of getting 10-packs shipped out for $2500 :(<br /><br />Shrooms:&nbsp; Not a whole lot of interest around here lately, really have no clue - much prefer clean L<br /><br />DMT:&nbsp; Very little being sold, but prices range widely when it&#039;s around.&nbsp; As it should be, it&#039;s usually just homies making a batch for their friend group.&nbsp; When it isn&#039;t though, it can be anywhere from $60-175/g.<br /><br />Ketamine:&nbsp; Rarely comes around due to no one in town wanting to be &quot;that guy&quot; lol, but when it does it&#039;s usually $70-100/g<br /><br />Everything else:&nbsp; Myself and my homies don&#039;t fux with it for the most part - no idea on prices but availability is definitely there.

				Windy City:<br /><br />To be honest everything I&#039;ve gotten of SR has been 9999999 times better than any street shit but I&#039;ll post what I&#039;ve encountered regardless. <br /><br />Coke: Only gotten fire gear 1 time. Most of its cut to shit, I&#039;ve tasted fiberglass and drywall before. Had it burn going up and some drips that burnt as well. I try to avoid the white girl here. Most of it comes from folks in with local Hispanic gangs. Price is anywhere from $40-70/gram with a better deal on ye olde ball.<br /><br />LSD: Never had it here but I&#039;ve heard friends get OK stuff, based on their experiences. Again, very doubtful of the potency/quality but most folks take at least 2 hits, so perhaps local product averages 50 - 100 micro-grams?<br />Anywhere from $10-15/hit, never inquired about sheets. I believe there&#039;s some older hippie who handles that shit. An experienced friend bought some Hoffman&#039;s from SR&nbsp; and said it was some of the highest quality he&#039;s seen in a while haha, maybe that says something?<br /><br />MDMA/Pills: Alot of stepped on Chicago Mints and occasional molly at raves/concerts, anywhere from $10-20/pop depending on how many you buy. A&#039;s, =&#039;s, Bowling Balls, Blanks, etc in many different colors. Had a decent time on a few of em but most of the time I need at least 2 to get me really going and I roll about once every 2 months. Pills are sketchy either way, shitty press, really crumbly, I try to avoid. My mint guy loves when I get SR pills in, he really likes them and I often make out like a bandit :)<br /><br />Weed: We actually do get pretty decent weed here, 90% of it is kush or super high-quality dro. Either way I&#039;ve never had anything really bad. Prices are pretty street-typical but my dude sometimes does $20 1.2gs. Otherwise its ~$55 eights, 90 quads, etc. Don&#039;t really smoke too much anymore though.<br /><br />Prescription: Addys, Vyvanse and Xanax are pretty popular. Oxis and hydros can be rare but when they are around they are decently cheap, most of the time less than $1/mg, which is nice. Pins come around alot too.<br /><br />Also got a connect for tanks of Nitrous which is always fun&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
