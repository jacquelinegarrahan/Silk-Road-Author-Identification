				Greetings fellow users and abusers,<br /><br />While this will be far from my first time at such an event, it is my first time after joining up with the road. As a result I have a rather large amount of substances going with me (meeting me there actually :-) I&#039;d love to hear anyone&#039;s advice on how to get the most out of my suitcase. My current inventory (shared among a couple of friends) is as follows: <br /><br />5g MDMA (dosed in 100mg caps), <br />30 hits of LSD, <br />50 hits of 25i-NBOMe (1mg tabs), <br />a little over an 8ball of cocaine, <br />2g M1 (bk-mdma)<br />A handful of mushrooms left over from years past (I&#039;m not a huge fan of shrooms)<br />and more than enough weed, hash oil, and nicotine to last me.<br />Beer and other Alcohols which are mostly just to gift away<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried all of these things before, but usually with at least a month or so between them. Last year I did end up with enough to be on something every day but my friends and I all agreed if we had spaced things out we might have gotten more out of them.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be in the desert for about 8 nights in total,&nbsp; and I don&#039;t want to over do things too early. Previous years I&#039;ve just alternated between LSD one day and molly the next (increasing the dose each time), but this year I have a lot more than I&#039;ve ever had for a single event in the past. I know LSD and 25i are cross tolerant, I&#039;d rather save the LSD for the night of the man burning but I&#039;m not sure how much i should take then (if i where to have had a dose of 25i the night or 2 before for example). Molly seems to work well enough (at least for energy and general socialization) in regular doses, last year I even took it twice on some days and still felt a good deal of bliss near the end of the even. <br /><br />Any advice is greatly appreciated.

				I don&#039;t usually do psychedelics the first night, just stimulants.&nbsp; Might be a good coke night; I usually just do provigil.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wednesday is a good acid night.&nbsp; Plenty going on, but its a real psychedelic vibe early in the week.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have lots of company.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thursday I would do MDMA.&nbsp; Friday would be combo night.&nbsp; Like a half tab of acid with some MDMA.&nbsp; Mmmm!<br /><br />So that&#039;s four nights?&nbsp; Sheesh that would be enough for me.&nbsp;

I did roughly a gram in 3x in about a 9 day period. Wasn&#039;t planned, just ended up happening and I wouldn&#039;t want to do it again, but I had no issues with come down or anything. No big crash, but I take Vit C and 5htp, so that maybe helps. I honestly have not felt very many negative side effects from it and I know haven&#039;t created some crazy tolerance because I just recently rolled on 105mg and it was pretty good time. <br /><br />I agree tho, I think 2g in 8 days is WAY too much, I can&#039;t even imagine you&#039;d roll after the first couple of days. I know my second day in a row is very muted usually. I peak HARD but it comes back down pretty fast. I&#039;d get some 2c-b or something to fill in for the MDMA. On that 105mg roll, I took 25mg of 2c-b about 45mins into the peak and I seriously rolled for about 7 hours. I&#039;d try that combo before I attempted 2g in 8 days.

Now that i think about it, I probably won&#039;t do more than 1g. Last year i was taking it almost every day (for the week) to give myself energy, This year I have coke for that. I will probably do something along the lines of what HenryC0833 posted, the coke will probably last me a day or 2 and I&#039;ll probably take 25i on wednesday, molly thursday, Mushrooms on friday and candyflip on saturday.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll be gifting a lot of molly and 25i this year.&nbsp;

Your roll Thursday should carry over to your trip on Friday, I would think...so that might make it even better. <br /><br />Have a blast and come back and let us know how it was. I&#039;ve never been and never really even heard of it until I started playing around on these forums so it&#039;d be interesting to hear your experiences/trips.
