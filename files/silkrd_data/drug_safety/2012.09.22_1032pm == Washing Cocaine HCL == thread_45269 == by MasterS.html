				I am not new to chemistry (still massive amounts to learn but I am strong in the basics) but wanted confirmation since I am very new to cocaine.<br /><br />First do a Chloroform wash since it is soluble in chloroform and this will remove Amphetamines.<br />Then do 1-3 anhydrous acetone washes to remove a lot of other cutting agents<br /><br />Will these 2 wash types remove other caines? If not what does?

				Have you ever read LeJunks legendary purification article? I read it many moons ago, I found it of great assistance, it will show you how to clean amphet, ephedrine, psuedoephedrine, and the rest. Leaving you with the cocaine of your dreams!<br /><br />(clearwebalert) http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27089<br /><br />If you are going to use chloroform, refer to the connoisseur method, yes it takes longer, but it&#039;s well worth it! Hope this article helps you, and best of luck!&nbsp; :)

				Yes I read it a month ago and actually a few hours ago for a refresher ^_^ Thank you for the referral though. I am all about the connoisseur approach. I don&#039;t remember reading anything about removing other caines which is what i was really asking so I&#039;ll look some more.

				A simple anhydrous acetone wash will remove procaine, lidocaine, and benzocaine. Levamisole is the pain in the arse, since its properties to cocaine are very similar. Reading around I found this informative thread here <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3848.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3848.msg46594#msg46594">Quote from: Greynick on November 15, 2011, 02:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Doesn&#039;t work - the Levamisole is a HCL as well and just bulks up the cocain frebase<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;ve found a method that works and it&#039;s a lot simpler than I thought it would be.<br /><br />TV&#039;s gear is cut with Levamisole but there&#039;s not too much of it. <br /><br />I do an anhydrous acetone wash .. then I crush the remaining powders up, filter them in coffee filter paper, put them in a non stick frypan without the handle .. dry them in a small turbo oven (less than 100C/200F) and put them on a large non stick fry pan. Using a &quot;pan for gold&quot; motion, I swirl the powders around the pan. The cocaine HCL forms large(r) clumps. The Levamisole forms a very fine white powder. The cocaine HCL always ends up pooling on one side and the Levimisole and other non soluble in acetone cuts ends up sticking to the surface of the pan. I then tip the large chunks onto a separate non stick fry pan and dry any acetone off in the sun or in a low temperature (less than 100C / 200F) turbo oven. <br /><br />What is left has almost no Levamisole and is pretty damn pure / 80s esq in its awesomeness. <br /><br />Grey<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Will have to give this a spin next time, seems legit! ;)

				Oooh that&#039;s awesome thank you! Levamisole is the one I was mostly afraid of.

I take cocaine washing seriously , if you believe in purity and how it should be, every regular user should know it. Just remember to have a box of tissues to hand, when you find out how cut to shit your shit actually is, 9/10 this is sad but true!&nbsp; :&#039;( The plus side is that you&#039;ll be left with the most pure peng you&#039;ve ever had in your life - It&#039;s all swings and roundabouts!
