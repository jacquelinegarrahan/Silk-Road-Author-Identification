				Hello Guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m new on this website and so glad to find it :-)<br /><br />My question is very easy for you because your are in this business for a long time. What is the difference between the differents colour of mdma. <br /><br />Does that mean something special or it&#039;s random?<br /><br />For me there is : White mdma, brown mdm, orange&nbsp; mdma and transparent mdma<br /><br />Maybe one is stronger than another one??<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Skunk69

				Pure MDMA is transparent but appears snow white when the crystals are ground up. <br /><br />Any colour at all is due to the presence of impurities which were not removed by the chemist at the end of the synthesis. There are often rumours that orange or &#039;tan&#039; MDMA is stronger or trippier or whatever- this is not true.<br /><br />However, these impurities are very highly coloured so even if the MDMA is 99.8% pure, the 0.2% impurity could be sufficient to make it appear dark orange, purple or brown. <br /><br />So to summarise, colour is no indication of purity.

				I&#039;m glad you&#039;re always able to give us accurate chemical advice, wowzers. It really is greatly appreciated. I&#039;ve never seen a post where you&#039;re wrong in any sense, and in many instances I learn something new because of your post. =]<br /><br />Basically, what it comes down to with the different colors of MDMA, your dealer is just going to try to sell it to you however they can, so saying good things about the particular color will help them move product, even though they really may not know anything about it. =P

				This question comes up periodically, along with a few others &amp; whilst I don&#039;t mind answering at all, I do sometimes find myself being repetitive. <br />It would be good to have a proper FAQ for MDXX. I might start writing one which if the mods think is good enough, could be stickied in the Drug Safety section. I know most of the info can be found on Bluelight and the like but often the solid, informed advice gets swamped by bullshit &amp; off-topic copypasta from pihkal, strike, rhodium etc. <br /><br />Just a suggestion and I&#039;m not committing to doing it right now as it would be a large undertaking but I&#039;ll give it some consideration if there&#039;s any interest in it.&nbsp; :D

				I&#039;ve had MDMA crystals ranging from purplish hue, to tan-orange, and translucent crystals.<br /><br />All of been about the same quality. <br /><br />Although last time i ate about 225mg of these really translucent crystals. Now that i think about it, it sounds like i ate some really good MDA, cus i was fucking rolling so hard it felt like i was tripping. I was floored, and the air around me was electric, as The Flaming Lips started playing Time everything felt almost dream like.<br /><br />Shit was amazing.<br /><br />Either way, in my experience color has never been an indication of quality.

				Color is no indication of skill on the makers part or quality. Just beware of yellow MDMA powder and all pills whatever their stamp or color is. Get a PMMA test kit from EZ test in the UK or dancesafe in Washington to make sure whatever it is you are taking is actual MDMA and not who knows what. Break the pill in half, test the outside and layers inside. <br /><br />http://www.eztest.com/2/druginfo/pma-pmma<br /><br />Highly doubt somebody would sell PMA/PMMA here as MDMA but on the streets you never know
