				Hey all,<br /><br />So far I had several experiences with LSA (with Hawaiian baby rosewood) and one, recently, with LSD (~200mics). <br />I had made better and worse extractions of HBRW, the best of which had zero nausea, but everytime I was getting very cold, something I associated with the nasty extra stuff in the seeds. However, tripping on LSD I also experienced coldness, a lot of focus on my breathing, and a sort of restlessness. My LSD trip was all framed by that experience (I&#039;ve decided to overhaul my room to make it a better living space for myself), but I know that with LSA, or at least I think I remember that, eventually I &quot;got over&quot; the temperature issue, though now that I think about it, I think it happend only towards the end of the trip, as I was coming down.<br />So perhaps my whole tripping experience involves temperature regulation problems. <br /><br />Anyone had a similar experience in their beginning-of-tripping career, and overcame it?<br />What should I do to overcome this?<br />While tripping I was wary about increasing the temperature in the house, thinking that maybe I only &quot;think&quot; that my body is cold, while it is fine (in general, while sober, I have a very high coldness tolerance--- I dress significantly with less layers than others, and get really hot when others are not). But perhaps it is not that I only &quot;think&quot; that I&#039;m cold, but rather that my body is actually doing a bad job &quot;being warm&quot;.<br />What would you suggest? Increasing the temperature in the house as I prepare to drop some Lucy? Dressing extra warm as I venture outdoors?<br /><br />Much love and peace&nbsp; 8)<br />megaman52

				my answer is not based on medical facts or knowledge, <br />it&#039;s just my personal experience - I do hope someone with more accurate medical knowledge will reply to this post...<br /><br />we often felt cold during the trip, especially in the beginning and then we always used blankets (we mostly tripped outside spending the night in the forest where it&#039;s unpractical to heat up the forest for one night).<br />i think that when you&#039;re using LSD it&#039;s all about the way you experience it, so if you feel cold it will probably not be a nice experience - that&#039;s why I would just take a blanket and curl into it. <br />sometimes the fabric of the blanket will be an experience on itself<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t heat the house more than normally, because you never know: you might feel warm next time and then that would be a waste<br /><br />also, someone told me once (again: not medical) that when you go &quot;up&quot; (on whatever product) it&#039;s normal for your body to feel cold (the guy had a long spiritual explanation for it, but I can&#039;t remember now). <br /><br />as far as I know there is no risk of &quot;overheating&quot; with LSD (contrary to MDMA where that risk is real), so I wouldn&#039;t mind to take a blanket if I feel cold, or even 2 if I still feel cold, or even... untill I feel warm, comfy and safe again - that way you&#039;re much more able to enjoy the experience and thus to &quot;let got&quot; (because that&#039;s all it&#039;s about: letting go, letting the experience take you to new fantastic places).

				just raise your core body temperature by doing&nbsp; some exercises and/or going for a good walk immediately prior to tripping. temperature sensitivity has not been a problem for me since i started exercising regularly<br /><br />also try to focus the mind on external things rather than on your bodily states<br /><br />like marijuana, LSD does make you more sensitive to the cold. you won&#039;t be any danger of overheating if you increase the temperature in your house to a reasonable degree

				Thanks. I think the point of diverting my thoughts to objects other than my body is a good one. Also, I think I&#039;ll try indeed next time to pre-heat the house (it&#039;s not much space) to a hopefully more comfortable temperature.<br />Thanks!

				Vasiconstriction (did i spell that right?) can make you feel cold. <br />Restlessness comes from the simulating effects of the drugs. <br />heavy focus on breathing&nbsp; happen because you speed up mentally so fast that your breathing feels slow and uneven and you try to force it.&nbsp;

				Been tripping regularly about 15 years now, and have the same issue with getting cold when coming up.&nbsp; It&#039;s worse with shrooms than with acid.&nbsp; On strong trip evenings, what I like to do is take a hot bath while coming up.&nbsp; Sure keeps me warm, and it sets a nice tone before heading out for the night or settling in for a movie or other recreation.<br /><br />On nights where a bath isn&#039;t practical, I came to the eventual conclusion that I&#039;m happier if I take less of the drug of the evening instead, thus lessening the come-up issues.&nbsp; As they say, sometimes less is more. A shot of whiskey is usually enough to dull the remaining discomfort.
