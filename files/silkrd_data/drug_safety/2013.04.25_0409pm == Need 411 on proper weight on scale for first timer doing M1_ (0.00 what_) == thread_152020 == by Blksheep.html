				I am getting some M1 and never took it before. Supposed to be good. When I place on a digital scale, what should I weigh out for a safe dose? 0.00? Place in a gel cap and ingest? Need 411. Thanks&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;d say weighing out .15 - .20 g to start off with. (150-200mgs)<br /><br />Methylone is like a less intense MDMA, with little to no crash unless you fiend. Enjoy! I&#039;d recommend taking no more than 300 mgs a night. 200 mg + 100 mg dose 1 hour or so in. Tends to extend it a bit so you can squeeze every last second of fun out of it.<br />

				I think it depends on what you are use to as well as what your height and weight is..<br /><br />We, my partner and I, Like about 300mg of Bk-mdma to start and ether cap it or Subling it.. Letting it melt in your mouth and under your tongue for 15 to 20 mins keeping your saliva in your mouth the whole time and swallowing when you cant take it any longer ( best for MDMA too BTW)&nbsp; You will be up in 10 to 15 mins this rout <br /><br />Some people say re-upping is useless but we do and everyone else I know does.. Once maybe twice and anywhere from 150mg to 200mg each time.. <br /><br />BK-MDMA / M1 / Mathylone uses about 1/3rd the chemical processes in the brain that MDMA does there for it is less nerotoxic then MDMA is. <br /><br />**FAIR WARNING ** Even if you do not have an addictive personality you will carve and want to keep reupping.. at some point it is pointless and will do nothing but make you jittery.. Try very very hard not to over do it.. You are best off weighing out what you plan on taking then putting the rest of what you have far away from where you are enjoying it.. That way you don&#039;t get into it and eat it all.. It HAPPENS A LOT with people.. Its a Catho and they do that..
