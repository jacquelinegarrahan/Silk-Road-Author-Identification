				Im attending a few festivals this summer and am planning on sharing the love of some good quality XTC. The searches to get into a festival are very laid back but very rarely they will pull an unfortunate candidate aside for extensive searching with a K-9 unit. Playing it safe, Im wondering if there is any way to camouflage the MDMA so the dogs would never even realize. The best idea ive come up with is to double vacuum seal the xtc and make a candle around it. So basically, the product will be completely surrounded in all directions by 2 to 3 inches of solid wax.. <br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

				I had the luck to once see a presentation of drug dogs at work.<br />Main point is that they get tired very soon. A dog can work only for 5 to 10 minutes before his handler has to give him at least 20 minutes to 1 hour of rest and play.<br />They are trained with rubber sticks filled with various substances that are their toy to them i.e. they look for the toy - not for drugs.<br />When they search and signal to the handler he will pull out the toystick and give it to the dog as a reward. <br />While the dogs on display managed to discover drugs (heroin,cocaine, hash) hidden in a stack of cardboard boxes within a minute the dog had to be slightly &quot;guided&quot; to discover a package in a 48-seater autobus.<br /><br />Recent studies conclude that the dogs try to satisfy their handler, giving a lot of false positives.<br /><br />They cannot work on a luggage band for more than 5 minutes at the most.<br />It is very much about psychology as most people will show nervousness when a dog circles their legs.<br />The dogs did not alert to a small piece of smoke I had in my pocket which I had forgotten in my handbag.<br />So I am not nervous anymore when I see a drug dog. As these are expensive animals many dogs at US airports are just plain watchdogs put on display.<br />A very effective diversion is a dog in heat. The drug dogs will forget their duty, just like all males when they smell pussy.&nbsp; :D <br />German customs used a pig for while but it was retired because passengers mocked the handlers a lot.<br /><br />

I kindve assumed that they were there for more of a display and the cops just react based on your behavior, so basically dont show paranoia.

				Its a good thing to notice that such dogs are trained to find a specific drug, not all illicit drugs in general. <br /><br />The ones at airports are such are trained to find cocaine, opiates or cannabis specifically. Those are not able to sniff out mdma which is a completely different substance and would not trigger any reaction in those dogs. <br /><br />Also, these dogs are not trained to detect anxiety in people at all, but they could develop an instinct for that throughout their work. After all they do get rewarded for finding drugs and people that get anxious around them are either carrying drugs or just afraid of dogs in general. Once they start homing in on anxiety they become useless though, since a fairly large number of people are afraid of strange dogs sniffing up on them. <br /><br />Humans are another factor however. While they certainly cannot sniff out drugs, they can be trained to detect signs of anxiety and such quite easily. Observation techniques are used to detect all kinds of ill intent. This focuses more on terrorism and such than on drug trafficking, but if you appear extremely anxious chances are that well trained security staff will notice that.

				Tempted to say, There are so many ways to beat a drug dog, cricket bat, stick boot etc but the truth is its no joking matter and there oughta be a law against using them,[ in some democracy&#039;s&nbsp; there use is not allowed].<br />This might work at a pinch, Know it can be used at airpoirts flights etc. Red herrings, sent up caps or marbles and if dog is seen, roll them around so as many people as possible come in contact with the scent. In theory should spin the crap out of dog. There was some science in Aust recently that suggested that at best the dogs are only about 18% correct on there strike rate, unfortunately still spoils the ride for the others.

				I suspect the drug detection dogs main weakness today would simply be that they are trained for the old favorites.. particularly Marijuana + Cocaine. <br /><br />Drugs today are incredibly varied, and between analogs, new compounds, research chemicals and prescription drugs the vast majority of drug varieties will go undetected. Can drug dogs detect 2-CB,&nbsp; JWH-18 or Oxycontin for example? Even Mephedrone? I&#039;m guessing not but does anyone know for sure?<br /><br />Not saying this to encourage alternatives, just an observation. <br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.
