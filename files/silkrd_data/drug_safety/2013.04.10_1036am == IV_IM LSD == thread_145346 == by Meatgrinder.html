				Hey guys,<br /><br />Does anyone here get nausea from LSD trips?<br /><br />Reason I&#039;m asking is because some of my friends do, some of my friends don&#039;t. The ones who do wish they could bypass that, IV/IM seems to be the way to go.<br /><br />Who here has done it? What is your opinion on it?

				I&#039;ve never gotten nausea from LSD. <br />I don&#039;t know about injecting LSD man... it sounds risky. If you were to do it, you better know what you&#039;re doing. And you better know 100% that it&#039;s actually LSD you&#039;re putting in your arm.<br /><br />I could just be a worry wort but I don&#039;t know.

				If your friends are getting nausea it&#039;s probably either &quot;motion sickness&quot; related, or it&#039;s not really LSD.<br />It&#039;s not any chemical action on the stomach that could be mitigated by doing it in a different way.<br /><br />Yes you can inject LSD, but as Aussie mentions, I&#039;d be sure it was good stuff, and you want to start with crystal or liquid.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you could do some of the liquid here IM without too much trouble, though you might want to ask the heroin thread or some of the other &quot;pokers&quot; around here as to what makes for safe injections.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think a drop of vodka mixed with LSD will hurt.

				That will work, in theory.<br />You need a liquid medium to help it transfer through the bowel though.<br />Otherwise, not worth it.<br />(I&#039;ll try almost anything, once)

				the nausea experienced on psychedelics is not always caused by a reaction to the drug itself, but by negativity and fear during the trip. the root cause is often psychological but since we feel it in the body, we usually assume it&#039;s just physical. the simplest way to get out of that state is to surrender and go with the flow. throw up if necessary because resistance will only make things worse... you&#039;ll feel much better after purging. for physical nausea and bodily discomfort i would recommend cannabis. in my experience, nothing is more effective. :)
