				My guess would be 70-75 percent. If it&#039;s rock what you&#039;ll want to do is place the rock down on the surface where you want to crush it up on assuming you&#039;re snorting. Then grab a ziplock bag and place it over the rock, grab a hammer and lightly tap the rocks till they&#039;re down to fine powder. Once you&#039;ve achieved fine powder I suggest starting out with a SMALL line due to fishscales being powerful especially if you&#039;re used to street blow.<br /><br />Hopefully that helps!

				if you care what goes in your nose (and in other peoples veins) you shouldnt cut it with anything! <br /><br />quality over quantity... <br /><br />if you must for some reason, use something like pure lactose because its pharmacologically inert, white powder safe to shoot

				since its pretty obvious you probably want to cut it to resell you should realize you will please your customers more and earn their respect if you provide higher quality product<br /><br />i know so many people who would rather drive four times as far and pay twice as much to hit up the guy with fire. only reason id hit up someone with less potent gear is if the guy with the good shit isnt available <br /><br />dont cut your gear. its best for everyone

Never cut your gear, I would rather pay double for good quality product, rather than less money for some gear that is 50% baby powder.
