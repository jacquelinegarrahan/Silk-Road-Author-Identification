I really don`t know why the questions are being asked after your purchase...<br /><br />Xanax doses range from 0.25 to 3.0 and even 4.0. You would have to get a scale that is capable a accurately display 0.001g for safely measuring. Standard gel capsules (0 size) can be used. A pill sieve makes the job easier, and produces caps faster. I really think you should refrain from selling at this point. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30950.msg347802#msg347802">Quote from: shiznit on July 16, 2012, 12:13 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">dont!<br /><br />you are going to kill someone<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thats what I fear as well.

				Dude unless you have a $1000 scale you&#039;re fucked. The margin of error on cheaper scales is way higher than the average dose of Xanax which is active at the sub-milligram level. The only way you could measure it somewhat accurately is to dose out 100mg baggies because the margin of error is low. Still morally and from a harm reduction point of view you&#039;re going to screw some people up pretty badly if they get some of your Xanax and overdose, which happens a majority of the time. Google &quot;phenazepam horror stories&quot;. There is no way to eyeball a dose of Xanax or dose it out at the milligram level unless you&#039;re a pharma company. <br /><br />I would not buy Xanax powder for this reason. The LD50 on benzodiazepines is high, so the likelihood of death is low, but expect some black-outs and crazy shit happening.<br /><br />I for one would not feel comfortable making homemade Xanax caps and selling them. You&#039;re responsible for whatever happens to your customers. From a moral and legal perspective it is a horrible, horrible idea.

				Well here is what you do my friend, get some grain alcohol, 90-95% http://danmurphys.com.au/product/DM_905095/polmos-spirytus-rictified-spirit-95-500ml<br />Measure out 1 gram of the stuff, work out your concentration personally i enjoy 25mg/10ml, so for every 400ml of alochol, use 1 gram of xanax.<br />http://sunmartsyd.en.ec21.com/Plastic_Droppers_and_Glass_Pipettes--3942723_4146233.html<br />Then you buy these suckers (get it suckers... pipettes... oh nevermind, try the veal).

				I have seen a seller here (kwiktrip) that was selling Xanax on blotters, i don&#039;t know &quot;his&quot; method but if the powder don&#039;t dissolve well in water i think you could use HPBCD (Hydroxypropyl Beta Cyclodextrins) powder to complex them like 25I or some steroids. I have not seen KT for a while on Silkroad but maybe he can give you some good information&#039;s on the subject.

				I think the method for laying xanax on blotters would be using alcohol, but not grain, isopropyl i believe. Mix the powder with the alochol (alprazolam powder dosn&#039;t mix with water) set the blotters, evaporate the alocohol over the course of a couple of days. Bam xanax blotters, much easier to transport than powder or capsules or liquid.

				Yes you can make a solution in alcohol. It&#039;s a lot more accurate than trying to dose on a scale. Still you&#039;re likely going to fuck up eventually and do too much. With a margin of error of a few milligrams you&#039;re gonna have a bad time unless you&#039;re a seasoned bluelighter and have the benzo tolerance of Whitney Houston. <br /><br />I&#039;m not preaching, I love benzos.

				The Grand Wizard has considered buying a gram of alprazolam, then offering a 50mg &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; special. <br /><br />&quot;Have you ever woke up 500 miles from your home wearing your mother&#039;s underwear? Two bitcoins and you too can spend the next three days engaging in behavior that would give a hardcore MDPV tweaker pause. You might not remember your antics, but don&#039;t worry: you&#039;re sure to hear about them in court. Buy today: forget next week.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Alas, I decided it would be irresponsible. Funny as fuck, but irresponsible.&nbsp; Although if I get enough requests I might reconsider ;) <br /><br />To the OP: do NOT make your own caps with your alprazolam powder! You don&#039;t have the necessary equipment, and there&#039;s a big difference between 2 and 4 mg of xanax, never mind a margin of 5mg.&nbsp; Sell this as powder in baggies if you must.&nbsp; At least then your buyers will have to weigh it themselves: if they decide to dose like idiots it&#039;s on them.&nbsp; Selling someone a &quot;2mg&quot; cap of xanax that could contain as much as 7 or 8mg is a very, very bad idea.

				I have a 15mL dropper where 22 drops = 1mL. I am looking to make some xanax 1 drop = 1mg or even 1 drop = 2mg if its possible. Using 11mL of 95% everclear drinking alcohol, not poisonous denatured ethanol, I would need 242mg to dissolve into 11mL of 95% ethanol to get 1 drop to = 1mg or 484mg dissolved into 11mL of 95% ethanol to get 1 drop to = 2mg. Can 11mL of 95% ethanol hold 484mg of xanax without any powder coming out of solution if not can 242mg fully dissolve without precipitating out of 11mL 95% ethanol. The liquid would be at about 23C and would stay stored at that temp as well.<br /><br />I really hope someone has this info and if you can link me sources of more reliable info that would be excellent as well. I just really need to know how well everclear can dissolve xanax.

Since the doses are so small it would probably be best to cut it in a ball mill in a 1:100 ratio with something inert like cellulose or lactose and make capsules containing a weighed amount of the mixture. Provided you mix well (which is by&nbsp; no means easy!) that should be the safest method of delivering a consistent product.
