				Anyone have experience using nootropics such as Pramiracetam/Piracetam?<br /><br />I have read bits and pieces here and there about their positive effects on helping to break down the fat tolerance many of us have built to MDMA or other drugs. I have also read that taking these nootropics can be highly effective means to improve memory, attention span, and overall brain function (addy without the stimulant effect?). <br /><br />I trust SR members and their opinions more than most of the uninformed fools that post on many message boards, so if any of you have used them... could you please document your experiences/dosage levels/how to start/where to order?<br /><br />Thanks, much appreciated! Cheers.&nbsp; :)

				Not exactly useful post, but I just started taking piracetam couple days ago. I hate the taste of the powder, need to find a comfortable way to take it... I would also be interested in experiences from someone whos been using it for a longer time.

				you should try l - tryptophan instead of 5-htp. has less negative side effects when used habitually. a little more expensive, but you feel the difference.

				Piracetam fucked me up real good. I took it just over a week ago. The day I took it, I drank some and I blacked out before I could finish my second whiskey sour (to be fair, I make them whiskey-heavy). I was apparently acting very strange, stumbling around and &quot;answering different questions than were asked.&quot;<br /><br />The day after I felt very fuzzy-headed and unfocused and I don&#039;t feel quite normal even today (my focus just isn&#039;t there).
