				THC is a rather volatile substance, losing potency when exposed to air.<br />What is the best way to store vials of hash oil for 1 to 3 months?<br />

				Thats pretty standard lab operation indeed, usually you would put a nitrogen atmosphere over it, seal the vial and put it in cold storage. In a lab environment that would probably mean putting it in a sealed vial in a -80C freezer, but i suppose you do not have that at home. <br /><br />Next best thing is to use a container as small as possible to there is as little air in there as can be, and storing in in a -20C consumer freezer.

				I love smoking frozen hash oil. Its a lot easier to work with. Does anyone know how to make budder? Am I right in thinking its a solvent extraction of bubble hash followed by an airwhipping of the product in heat.

				Would freezing it also help with odor? Would it help with hash and bud odor as well?

				Yeah it probably would help with the smell because the terpenes wouldn&#039;t break down.<br />Before you unseal the bud or hash container, wait until it reaches room temperature or else moisture will get in.

				You know what could be the rarest, tastiest hash oil? distilled THC.<br /><br />Solvent extraction, physical separation, all have their perks. But I want someone to basically run a vaporizer&#039;s output through a condenser, and scrape the result. I&#039;ve let the glaze build up on the inside of a vape, and rez-hitting that is one of my favorite highs.<br />In a controlled setup, you could even fractionally select for THC, Cannabinol...<br /><br />It&#039;d already be decarboxylated at that point, I just would like to see it available.<br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s what budder is.

				Not rez in the sense of combustion byproducts, it&#039;s actually largely THC - if you consider the composition of the vapor you&#039;d get from kief, that&#039;s likely 80-90% THC. Slowly pipe it through a chilled glass tube, to capture it all, then run a plunger down it. You&#039;ll get oil with nearly zero contaminants that solvent extraction might include.
