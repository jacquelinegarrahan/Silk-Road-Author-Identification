				I recently bought some LSD sour patch kids from LSDirect and I want to take them as soon as I get them, but I am going through withdrawal from paxil right now. I stopped taking paxil about 3-4 weeks ago so I think the worst of the WD symptoms are gone, but I&#039;m still getting mood swings every now and again. What are the chances of me having a bad trip?

				I&#039;ve personally found that the more psychedelics I use.. the less SSRI&#039;s I need to take =)<br /><br />You should be fine =)<br /><br />If not... just pop a 50mg Trazodone and take a few shots.<br /><br />J

				3-4 weeks, you&#039;re good. Paxil has a half-life of less than 24 hours. So in 3-5 days there is NOTHING left in your system, so any withdrawal you are feeling is purely in your head. So relax, drop a tab or two and explore the universe.

				I will definitely report on my experiences. I have just a few more small questions. <br /><br />1. I plan on taking 2 tabs (candies) for the first trip and 3 for the next. I want a pretty strong trip; will this be enough or should I take 5 candies at once?<br /><br />2. Should I take the candies sublingual/buccal/chew/swallow?<br /><br />3. Should I take the doses one right after another, or take one and wait &#039;till the effects hit me and then take another one?

				Bro!&nbsp; Even if they are only 75mcg a piece 5 hits of that would be 375mcg trip.<br /><br />This will melt your face.<br /><br />Try starting with just one candy... suck on it for a while before you chew it up and swallow. <br />If you&#039;re lucky this candy will be in the 80-150mcg range.&nbsp; This would be PERFECT for a first trip.<br /><br />Give it @ LEAST and hour and a half before you redose!&nbsp; Once you start tripping it will hit you like a ton of bricks and you&#039;ll know it!<br /><br /><br />Also man... Paxil is evil as FUCK.&nbsp; I gained over 35lbs on it and it made me a fucking asshole.<br />Try 10mg of Lexapro a day if you think you need a SSRI of some sort!&nbsp; It&#039;s literally side-effect free and pretty dependable.<br /><br />PM me if you need anything!<br />J<br /><br />

				Take two bucally. Redosing on LSD does not increase the tripping, just marginally increases the duration so it&#039;s considered a waste of good LSD to most. <br /><br />If you take two and it doesnt take you where you want to go, wait 3-7 days (closer to 7 the better due to tolerance) and take 3.

First time I spent the day disassembling and re-assembling a scooter engine with a friend in my driveway. Don&#039;t ask me how we got it back together and running again, I still have no idea.<br /><br />And I hear ya on that evil paxil. I gained ~60lbs and lost ALL of my sex drive. I&#039;ve tried lexapro before, but it made me sleep for 36 hours the first time I took it, so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be taking it again. I&#039;m just gonna see if I can get along without any SSRI&#039;s. I might even get around to trying shrooms now that I&#039;ll actually feel something when I take them.

				Haha! Well good man, simply treat the candies like STRONG tabs and all should be well..<br /><br />I similarly stopped taking my Lex a few months ago.. only seemed to enhance the psychedelia&quot;&quot; ;) No negative effects as far as I can tell :D<br /><br /><br />Like bro said, let us know how it goes.. I&#039;d like to get a few myself if they are decent.<br /><br />Thanks<br />J

				Just got the package in the mail. I&#039;ll update once I&#039;m tripping, if I have the presence of mind and I&#039;m able to type. Thanks to everybody for their replies.

				Ok, effects are very evident now. I&#039;m trying my best to turn what I want to say into words, but keep getting distracted. Very much like a high-dose 25i-nbome experience I had, but with less visuals, at least so far. Tracers and color enhancement very obvious. Sight upset stomach, nowhere near puking or even uncomfortable.

				Have fun. LSD is one of my favorite drugs, though I do want to snag some 25i-NBOMe.<br />

				Well, I hate to say this, but the whole trip was a bit underwhelming. I was hoping to not be able to tell where I am anymore; to look at my hand and see a cheeseburger smiling back at me.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, the trip was still pretty intense and I have nothing but good things to say about LSDirect and his product, But I wanted...more.<br /><br />A couple months ago I vaporized 10mg of 25i-nbome. That was the experience I wanted to emulate with acid.<br /><br />Oh well, I still enjoyed the hell out of it. Playing colorful video games was like orgasms for my eyes.
