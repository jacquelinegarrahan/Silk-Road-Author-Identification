				Hi everyone!<br />I&#039;m interested in trying DMT, i read a lot about the subject, saw documentaries, video experiences, the chemical creation, the different ways to use it, different pipes, etc etc..<br />This will be my first time with drugs. I&#039;m mostly interested in the discovery of the &quot;other dimension&quot; feeling.. i&#039;m so curious to see how it is that i can&#039;t wait for it!<br />BUT, one thing is scaring me: i read often that, drugs like DMT or LSD could be dangerous in case you have latent mental problems, that could (or not) comes outside during your life, even if you never use drugs.. maybe in 10 years or more.. Now my uncle is schizophrenic, and i don&#039;t know why, but i ever thought that i will probably have some mental problem during my life.. I think this thing from years, and i really don&#039;t know why, i never had problems or depression or nothing else.. But it&#039;s just an idea.. i don&#039;t know why i&#039;m quite sure about it.. So, it scares me in taking DMT. I&#039;m afraid to become schizophrenic soon or something like that.<br />Have you ever heard about someone that had SERIOUS problems with psychedelic drugs? Or it&#039;s just an hypothesis?<br /><br />Thank you everyone!

				I love psychedelics, and respect them as much :)<br /><br />If you have family history of mental illness, bare in your mind what you propably already have read somewhere, that drugs like LSD can trigger mental illness.<br /><br />No one here can tell you for sure if it&#039;s safe for you to take psychedelic drugs, but in my opinion, DMT would be the least harmful. I can not say the same about LSD or shrooms.<br /><br />Resuming:<br />Salvia and DMT will give you some of the most intense psychedelic experiences you can get. They will last for only a few minutes and in my opinion they will not mentally drain you. <br />

				As the others have said, you are the best authority in knowing if your mind can handle these manner of drugs. I and my family have some various mental issues but I have been able to enjoy several psychedelics without repercussions (long-term, who knows?). If it&#039;s something you really want to experience, I&#039;d suggest start with DMT (it&#039;s what I started with). The chemical is naturally occurring in the human body and your body knows how to handle it and it processes quickly (details I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve already read about). <br /><br />Drugs as a whole, but psychedelics I believe most of all, will yield a certain amount of their power if you have enough force of will. I&#039;ve experimented with lots of drugs with minimal withdrawal/unwanted side effects by respecting the drugs and starting them in moderation and keeping a positive expectancy/mindset for the event. <br /><br />I first took DMT probably about 30mg or so (in a non-optimal smoking fashion). Last time, I vaped ~92mg and had a blast. Start slow and gradually work your way to something you are comfortable with. And be self-aware enough to know when you have to draw the line.<br /><br />And if psychedelics don&#039;t work out for you, there&#039;s plenty of drugs out there.<br /><br /><br />Cheers and be safe!

				Thank you everyone, you reassured me a little bit.. :) <br />Actually my idea is to start slowly with DMT (~20-30 mg), and to be honest i&#039;m not interested in other drugs at all. I&#039;m not searching for the entertainment or the pleasure or something else from drugs. I only want to try DMT<br />because of its &quot;spiritual&quot; effects, and then i really want to analyze the trip in a scientific way. I NEED to know if there is a chance of another world. I know it can sounds weird, but if you ever saw The Matrix, you know<br />that Neo was searching for the truth, searching for a way to exit from this world.. I believe that there is something else here, something that we don&#039;t &quot;feel&quot;.. and if DMT can give me an answer, or half answer, i need to try it.<br />That&#039;s the only reason why i want to try it. LSD seems to be &quot;stronger&quot; in the meaning of length of the effects, and as far as i know there are no strong breakthroughs with a perception of another reality, as with DMT..<br />Is it right?<br /><br />P.S. Who is the best DMT seller on SR? I was thinking to start buying a little bit of freebase from WALTER, do you know him? Have you ever tried his DMT? I don&#039;t want to be scammed, especially for my FIRST use of drugs in my life.<br />I&#039;m thinking to synthesize DMT by myself to be absolutely sure that the substance is pure, but i must find a good source of plants, and i don&#039;t know where to find mimosa, or other plants. I searched a little bit but it seems that is out of stock almost everywhere in internet.. Any advice?? (p.s. I&#039;m from Europe)

				walter is out of Denmark, if you can get a vendor in your country that is typically better. He is of course perhaps the original DMT vendor on this site, and is still going.<br /><br />The quality of DMT on Silk Road is in general a quality that you may not be likely to match yourself in an extraction, so there&#039;s nothing to worry about as far as that goes. If you are a science type, however, I might recommend doing it yourself if you think you can do it. Flammable fumes will be created, but it is a fairly safe procedure as long as you do your research right and don&#039;t get anything in your eyes or in your throat that shouldn&#039;t be there (very bad).<br /><br />DMT is a controlled experience, in the sense that you can control how much you smoke, and the trip is over within a certain amount of time. Do not however, think that the act of taking psychedelic drugs is in any way,&nbsp; a &quot;controlled experience.&quot; You&#039;re signing up for uncontrolled, and you&#039;re going to get what you want.<br /><br />That said, for those who are truly independent in their interest and have a strong interest in preparation and safety, valium and xanax are excellent trip aids that temporarily create a calm, cool, sober state, in the middle of what can be a hard trip.

				DMT I&#039;d say is a good start, I have not read or heard of any instances where DMT caused long term or even short term noticeable effects, with the exception of &quot;positive outlook&quot; and lifted mood.&nbsp; I always feel great after coming down from a DMT trip, though I can&#039;t really say I&#039;ve yet to have a spiritual or life-changing experience with it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some crazy shit on it though.&nbsp; 30mg is a perfect dose if you just want a fun ride around the edges of the universe, I can&#039;t really tell you what to expect beyond that, but I&#039;ve seen a man die and be reborn on the stuff, and he thanked me deeply for giving him the opportunity to break through.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pretty wonderful drug, just getting comfortable figuring out how to smoke it efficiently will probably frustrate you at first.

				There really are no guarantees on the long term effects of taking substances like DMT.<br /><br />As I understand you do not suffer from any mental illness yourself, but your family has some history with it. There&nbsp; is little proof these reactions have to be hereditary, but i would still advise caution. It would be best to have someone sober that can administer something like valium&nbsp; or xanax if things turn badly, and call emergency services if it turns out to be life threatening.

				I love DMT and it can show you some cool stuff, especially at breakthrough doses, but I&#039;d totally disagree with the statement that LSD won&#039;t give you a breakthrough regarding perception of another or a deeper reality.&nbsp; It is a risk (as all phych&#039;s are, including DMT) but if you looking for a true &quot;spiritual&quot; or reality breakthrough then you&#039;ve got to look at shrooms or peyote.
