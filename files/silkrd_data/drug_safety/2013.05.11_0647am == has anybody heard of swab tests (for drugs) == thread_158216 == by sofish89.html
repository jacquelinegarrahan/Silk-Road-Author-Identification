				I&#039;ve heard they are more commonly used in australia for cops when they pull over a motorist suspected for being high, they swab his cheek and wait a minute or two and supposedly if he his high it will show up which drug..<br />I&#039;ve looked online but there is very little info about this test..<br />Is there anybody who has taken this test or knows about it in regard to detection times?<br />I took the test today and am hoping to ease my mind..

				In australia.. (and I believe EU is using the exact same test kits in some places) you take the test.. wait 5 minutes and then they tell you the results.... If you are positive you go inside the van to take a more thorough test.<br /><br />The detection time depends on the drug.. but I believe for weed and possibly other drugs oral tests show the least amount of use.. I mean if you are a heavy smoker it could take weeks and weeks for you to pass a urine test but you might be able to pass the oral test after just a single week. Hair on the other hand could take months and months to pass.

				I dunno about rohypnol.... but I know for certain if you take xanax a couple of days in a row it can be detected upto 3 days after... more depending on how much and often you take it..<br /><br />to be honest their is soo many factors that contribute to the results.<br /><br />Some people also claim taking listerine before a test can skew the results ( i dunno about that ) so if thats true hopefully the alcohol might be the only thing they find.. Again though I have no clue.. and just basically thinking out loud :)<br /><br />good luck :)

				German police sometimes use it. But the so-called swipe test is more common, where they swipe the test strip over your forehead (to test your sweat for metabolites) and your hands (to test if you have recently handled drugs). The ordinary urine quick-test is also in use.

				LE here uses the cheek swab test, and it&#039;s being generalized. The version they have now tests for THC, Cocaine (and crack obv), Amphetamines and Meth, opiates and derivatives (methadone included). It shows positive for most drugs used in the last 12 to 24 hours, up to 2 days for cocaine (probably because some cheapos smear the residues all over their cheeks, gums, teeth etc... and have poor hygiene). <br /><br />It&#039;s a serious and apparently pretty cheap tool. It&#039;ll be everywhere pretty soon. Don&#039;t trip and drive :p<br />

				Detection times range from a couple hours to a few days.&nbsp; Look up what drugs and their oral detection times.

				yeah i used to have to do these for my employer!! they sucked! they have mouthwash that <br />combats the test if you have about 5-7 min to prepare. as far as weed goes they are only really accurate <br />within about 48hrs of smoking but ive had friends smoke the night before and pass no problem. with opiates<br />and benzos and coke always take 3-5days. ive used the mouthwash for these and its worked. its more <br />of an immediate test,unless you do copius amounts amounts of drugs the night before! hope that helps!<br />damn didnt know they did those sort of things for traffic stops in other countries!! thats rough!!

				There is another swab test which is a police roadside check in which the driving wheel is swabbed and results plus attitude of driver determine whether a full search is done or a blood test as driving under the influence of drugs can also lead to losing a license. <br /><br />My tip for the day would be NEVER smoke a spliff driving, especially skunk which will linger for days.<br /><br />Act up and a cop could enforce an actual blood sample test.<br /><br />Its not so much being on drugs or possessing them that gets you arrested, its attitude also. <br /><br />By the way, the police found traces of drugs in a lot of cars.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />The only arrests made were of people acting so obvious that cops will charge them for small amounts.<br /><br />As for swabs in my work, the boss is a bit of a user and all the workforce like to party so we don&#039;t see the point in testing. <br /><br />That is pretty good for me also.&nbsp; 8)
