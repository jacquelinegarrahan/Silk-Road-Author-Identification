				Fuck yea!&nbsp; My Doc had prescribed me a rather large supply, and of course, I always took more than prescribed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve woken up, butt ass naked in front of the refrigerator - eating everything in site.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had insomnia most my life, and this help - a lot.&nbsp; But the side effects were to much.&nbsp; <br /><br />My job is demanding, so I need to sleep at least 5 hours a night.&nbsp; I used to say Ambien was like turning out the lights,&nbsp; On minute you&#039;re awake and the next you&#039;re out.&nbsp; For me, I started waking up in the middle of the night and taking more, which really fucked me up.&nbsp; My wife, and ER nurse, started hiding them from me and dispensing them to me like a four year old. <br /><br />Now I use Kava, Melatonin, doxylamine succinate, and benadryl.&nbsp; On Sunday nights, I take Xanax and restoril (spelling?).&nbsp; Works much better, but my Nazi wife is tight with the dosages.&nbsp; Oh yea, I take a lot of adderall, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used to take tons of Tylonal PM, until she took me too a liver transplant unit at her hospital.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve taken Ambien/Zolpidem for two years now and I can sometimes get the mouth side effect you talk about. Does it also taste a bit metallic? I&#039;ve figured out that it&#039;d branding (or at least for me). Some brand names it doesn&#039;t happen with (and they&#039;re prescribed so it&#039;s not even a dodgy batch).<br /><br />Also, regarding the guy who had to retake it in the middle of the night -- me too! I did some research and the half life is only 2-3 hours. After being on it a while I&#039;d wake up after 2.5 hours and need more.<br /><br />I find the most effective in knocking me out is Quietiapine (Seroquel) and was on that for a long time, but it does have residual effects the next day if you take a high dosage.

				Ambien can be fucking crazy IMO.&nbsp; I have never taken MXE or K but have taken enough DXM to be a bit out of it but no trip.&nbsp; My girlfriend and I were trying to detox off of opiates and if you know anything about the withdraw it is fucking hell and you can&#039;t sleep and have horrible restless legs especially while laying down.&nbsp; My GF boss gave her a small handfull of Ambien to help us get some sleep.&nbsp; Well the first night on Ambien was our last I&#039;ll just say that.&nbsp; We each took two 10mg pills and within a couple of hours were hallucinating.&nbsp; It was horrible the worst thing ever while withdrawing trying to sleep.&nbsp; I saw a fucking naked ferry fly out of my closet. <br /><br />FUCK AMBIEN

				I know the Ambien in the mid 90s was amazing.&nbsp; The weird thing was it was like truth serum for me.&nbsp; After about 15 minutes I&#039;d just start saying whatever was on my mind to whoever.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t take them for about 10 years and now the Ambien is different.&nbsp; I can take them and stay awake, the old ones would knock me out in about a half hour.&nbsp; Plus the new Ambien only seems to last for only like 5 or 6 hours of sleep.&nbsp; Ambien used to be a fun drug.&nbsp;

				Small doses are like super Xanax to me. I feel relaxed, get tired, lay down, and fall asleep. Now if I take lots of it to get fucked up and stay awake on purpose, that&#039;s when all hell starts to break loose. You basically induce the sleepwalking side effect of the drug, causing you to fall into an almost-sleep where you indeed hallucinate and feel like you&#039;re tripping BALLS (cause you are lol). I took a bunch one time while sitting in my car, then without even thinking I went home, got my keys, and started to drive around the neighborhood at 4AM yelling out the window about how fake everything feels. Later that night I went to drop my friend off and lightly scratched like 3 parked cars along the way with my mirror. He was freaking out while I was still laughing and saying &quot;nah man, fuck that, this is all a dream&quot;. I then parked my car a few blocks away for no reason only to walk back to his house, again for no reason. All I remember after that is waking up to a phone call telling me to check my car. Hey, the experience was fun, but only because I was lucky. This is the only time I ever took a drug and actually &quot;lost&quot; my ego or whatever the hell it is that keeps you tied to reality.<br /><br />tl;dr it&#039;s fun and trippy if you take large doses and stay up but make sure you&#039;re with a responsible, sober (&lt;-- that was my mistake lol) person and FFS have them hide your keys!!!
