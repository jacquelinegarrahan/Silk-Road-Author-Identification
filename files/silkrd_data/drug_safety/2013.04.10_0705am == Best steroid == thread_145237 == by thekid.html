Not to mention the oral steroids can cause your liver hell if not properly planned.

				If your not going to pin, save your self the extra trouble and just go with prohormone/designer steroids so it&#039;s legal.<br /><br />D-bol also aromatizes so you will need an AI on hand if you don&#039;t want gyno.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is also very wet and you will get a lot of water retention that will make you look bloated.&nbsp; You will lose a lot of that weight after you go in to PCT(Post Cycle Therapy) which is to reboot your balls to start working again and create natural testosterone.<br /><br />If I were you I would go with the legal alternatives such as Epistane, Superdrol, Dymetazine, Methylsten, MLMG, Trendione,Halo, etc&nbsp; My personal favorite is Epistane.&nbsp; Insane strength, lean mass, mood uplift/euphoria,&nbsp; just all the good stuff.<br /><br /><br />Orals are methylated which are harsh on your liver. Well some are extra harsh and some are ok within reasonable dosages and time.&nbsp; It may also or may not raise your blood pressure so you will have to buy something called cycle assist or similar products to that. Take it through out cycle and PCT. You will also need a drug called Nolvadex or Clomid for PCT.&nbsp; I like to use Nolvadex which you can find on SR or just search for Research chemical tamoxifen.<br /><br />A example cycle of Epistane of 6 weeks would be:<br />40/40/40/40/40/40mg<br /><br />PCT of nolva after 6 weeks of Epistane for 4 weeks:<br />20/20/10/10mg<br /><br /><br />RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH.&nbsp; Go on steroid/PH forums and research.&nbsp; Without proper knowledge you will have a hard time maintaining gains and the cycle will not be as enjoyable as it could have been if you were prepared.&nbsp; Obviously I hope your training and diet are spot on and your not like 130lbs.<br /><br />Good luck and message me for any questions.

				If you&#039;re using orals that pack on mass fast and you&#039;re doing it right, it&#039;ll be obvious that you are on something.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be like gaining 5-10lbs in the first 2-3 weeks and possibly in total 15-20lbs for first cycles easily.&nbsp; <br /><br />Epistane doesn&#039;t cause bloat and and it won&#039;t pack on as much mass as dbol but it an amazing compound.&nbsp; I gained 17lbs on an all out bulk but Epi kept me LEAN and I trained VERY hard.

				More estrogen doesn&#039;t make you a bitch. You are past puberty so it won&#039;t turn you in to a woman.&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem with high estrogen is easier fat gain and the worse of all being estrogen binding to the estrogen receptors in the chest around the nipples causing breast tissue growth.&nbsp; This breast tissue growth is called gyno.&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t take testosterone to compensate for higher estrogen, it doesn&#039;t work like that.&nbsp; More testosterone mostly equals MORE estrogen.&nbsp; Your body can only do so much exogenous testosterone so your body converts it in to estrogen hence the term aromatization.&nbsp; Testosterone(AAS) when pinned or taken will aromatize to estrogen to a certain degree.&nbsp; Testosterone derived steroids like Dbol also aromatize to estrogen.<br /><br />What you need is an AI( Aromatise Inhibitor)&nbsp; What this does it binds to the estrogen in the body and destroys it.&nbsp; But an AI on cycle with compounds that do not aromatize isn&#039;t necessary unless you are getting gyno symptoms.&nbsp; This is because a good level of estrogen plays a big role in the male body for hormone production and helps build muscle.&nbsp; A good AI is aromasin aka exemestane.&nbsp; You can also find these as an research chemical for pretty cheap online.<br /><br />You can take 10-12mg every other day on cycle.&nbsp; Also if you happen to get very puffy nipples, hard sensitive and painful lump under your nipples, follow this protocol.<br /><br />Take the Aromasin at 25mg along with 10mg of Nolva until the symptoms disappear. Which should only be a few days.&nbsp; The nolva will block the estrogen receptors from binding and causing the tissue growth while the aromasin destroys the estrogen.&nbsp; &nbsp; However, it is totally normal for your nipples to get puffy and a bit sensitive on cycle.&nbsp; When taking anything hormonal this is 90% normal.&nbsp; It is when it starts getting extremely itch, burning, and hard painful lump starts forming it is a good sign to start following the protocol.<br /><br />Go to Prohormoneforum.com(CLEARNET)&nbsp; or leankbulk.com(CLEARNET) and start learning.&nbsp; Those guys are nice and helpful.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I told you are the basics.&nbsp; You will need to read and research and see how different people react so you can see how to deal with it better.&nbsp;
