				I&#039;m not a total newb to opiates but I have a few safety questions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had methadone before maybe a total of 5 times years ago. I&#039;ve also had experience with percs due to injury. I have zero tolerance atm though as I have only taken 3 percs since january of this year in total.<br /><br />I now have a 50 mg morphine IR tablet to play with and want to make sure I&#039;m not going to kill myself accidentally. I know morphine isn&#039;t that strong orally but I&#039;ve been taking xanax and cemetidine(tagament) lately, both of which potentiate opiates. My main concern is I don&#039;t want to end up dying in my sleep due to not breathing anymore from the combination.<br /><br />I take 200mg of Tagament a day and 1 to 2 mg of xanax a day. should I skip the xanax on the day I take the pill or will the low amounts of all drugs involved make this not a problem? i&#039;m about 220 lbs so I&#039;m thinking I should be fine since the morphine dose and bioavailability of it are so low but just wanted to check with people with more experience in this.

				First of all, xanax is not an opiate at all, although it can cause you to stop breathing in your sleep in combination with alcohol or other sedatives. Usually this condition presents more like an apnea than a &#039;stop breathing forever&#039; kind of ordeal. True respiratory depression can kill you, however.<br /><br />That said, 50 mg of morphine is not a small dose at all. I&#039;m not sure how well taking it as a tablet compares to injecting, but injecting 50 mg would literally be enough to put a wild (and intolerant) bull to sleep. If you have no tolerance at all, expect something like 10 mg to put you in a nice dreamy state, and 20 mg to knock you out. I&#039;d suggest taking no more than half that tablet - chances are you&#039;ll wake up in your bed, with little idea of how you managed to get there.

				Thanks for the info. I know xanax isn&#039;t an opiate but it&#039;s been cited in several opiate+benzo deaths from respiratory depression so I felt obligated to ask for some input.

				I suppose so - the combination of benzo;s with alcohol is fairly dangerous in that regard, so its often mentioned.<br /><br />Taking opiates with alcohol isnt that big of a different though, so if you are going to take that 50 mg of morphine i recommend both taking half of it and not using any other substance (including alcohol) if you do. Getting into bed just around taking such a dose may prove a pleasurable experience, not combining it with drink or other drugs may allow you to remember ;)

				Morphine orally isn&#039;t very bio availability. I can chew up morphine and get nothing out of it but to be honest I don&#039;t have much experience with it since it&#039;s far from my opiate of choice. From limited experience with morphine, diladid and other similar opiates you gotta pretty much shoot them up. I wouldn&#039;t be to worried about the morphine but wouldnt suggest mixing benzos with opiates. I&#039;ve done it more times than I can think of but you are very correct that it has lead to many deaths. Whenever I did it I was usually speed balling on some sort of stimulants so would take benzos to help come down. Never been much into benzos but always did enjoy mixing benzos with alcohol lol. I do not suggest doing that. As far as opiates and alcohol never had a issue and in fact always enjoyed the combo.

				opioids and alcohol actually has the potential to be incredibly dangerous and i wouldnt recommend it <br /><br />one of the most dangerous combinations involves oxymorphone - which you should absolutely NEVER drink and take OM<br /><br />the reason is because alcohol alters the bio-availability of oxymorphone and can cause a massive increase in the amount absorbed which has been fatal for numerous people unaware of the interaction - and dont use this to try and get more out of your opana because it can also have the opposite effect in some people and reduce the BA<br /><br />plus it reduces the overdose threshold for other opioids in general just like benzos because its a CNS depressant which also acts on the GABA receptor as well as alters the axonal conductivity and slows neural transmission globally

				Awareness is certainly an issue, and one that receives too little attention. On the leaflet with tylenol it will state that you should not combine it with alcohol, yet you know that 99% of people that did anyway survived to tell the tale, which usually isn&#039;t that interesting at all (it hurt less and i fell asleep).<br /><br />I&#039;m sure its part of the trend to overdo warning labels (on a matrass: do not swallow) but it generates a lot of confusion. I suggest a gradation in labels for this: from yellow (only a disclaimer, like tylenol) to orange (benzodiazepines, serious risk of respiratory depression), to red (barbiturates, fair chance of death) to black (things like oxy that make it fairly reasonable you will not live till morning). <br /><br />Overstating warning labels simply causes deflation in their value: if it says combining tylenol with drink is dangerous, and it also states taking valium with alcohol is dangerous, what should indicate to users that the first combination if perfectly fine to do once, while the latter could actually result in death? And, especially, if peole did the first anyway, what would motivate them from trying the second?

				Just to be safe can you stop the benzos long enough to experiment with only the opiates in your system?<br /><br />I think the problem is you have two risk factors at once - the unknown impact of the 50mg pill and the cross drug risk.<br /><br />

				Whoever said 50mg is enough to kill a bull has no idea what he is talking about. And injecting is NOTHING like other ROA especially with morphine. 50mg will barely get an opiate naive person high.

				Benzos are not good to be combined with opiates as they would cancel out each other&#039;s actions.<br />Keep xanax in hand in case u had a bad trip, or a bad come-down. <br /><br />Plz note that Morphine Instant Release is different to the Extended Release one. So it would be faster and stronger. So be careful.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have much experience with Morphine IR. However, please search and read online about the method of administration. Cuz some morphines have other ingredients attached to them, so u may need to cook your morphines. Cooking method is explained online.

				Okay there&#039;s a little bit of mis-information here. Usually I&#039;m a lurker, hence the no posts. <br /><br />First off, to a completely opiate naive person I would recommend anywhere from 30mg oral morphine. Oral morphine is roughly equivalent to hydrocodone taken the same way according to dosage charts, however in my opinion this only corresponds to analgesic effect. And for those that are curious 10mg IV morphine is roughly equivalent to 30mg taken orally, making it&#039;s availability around 33% (Oral). <br /><br />Benzo&#039;s do not cancel out opiates effects. That is NOT a good thing to tell people. Benzo&#039;s are considered to potentiate the effects of opiates and most other CNS depressants. In my own experience this can be too true. They especially make the nodding aspect of the opiate high stronger. However if you&#039;ve been on a daily dose of xanax for some time now this should be less of an issue. Next, because you mentioned an aversion to needles (and the fact that it&#039;s an IR pill) you do not need to concern yourself with &quot;cooking the morphine.&quot;<br /><br />The only things I can think of that would &quot;reduce&quot; and opiates effect would be antagonists / partial agonist&#039;s such as Naloxone, Bupeprenorphine, Naltrexone, etc. <br /><br />I honestly have no idea how much of any opiate it&#039;d take to sedate a bull. <br /><br />In my opinion it&#039;s doubtful that 50mg of morphine taken orally and by a non tolerant user would result in death. However, considering that you&#039;re on or have been taking xanax the risk is increased. As someone asked earlier, if you aren&#039;t taking it daily then you make sure not to use it within 6-8 hours before using the morphine. If you&#039;re taking it daily you could reduce your dose slightly, so as not to cause an issue with dependence if it is there, and also reduce your risk for overdose.
