				I go to the gym 4-5 times a week and am a healthy young adult male.&nbsp; Ive always thought steroids were interesting but considering I will never really inject anything and I am pretty worried about side affects I am not sure if i really have too many options.&nbsp; Are there any steroids/supplements that are relatively safe, can be taken in pill/oral form and would work well with a already well planned out gym schedule?&nbsp; <br /><br />Im just curious, but hey ... curiosity killed the cat :)<br /><br />Thanks

				all oral steroids are inherently more dangerous then injectables as they need to be broken down by the liver and they are extremely liver toxic. Plus you will lose most your gains with an oral only cycle.&nbsp; your best bet would be to stack an oral with injectable Test for best results.<br />remember there not as dangerous as they make out and much safer then alcohol. just do your research beforehand theres a fuckton of info online.<br />Gary are you talking about bigger,faster,stronger?

				Forums.steroid.com<br /><br />Great heap of information that is available from long time users and knowledgeable people. Don&#039;t just jump in and start asking questions, they hate that. Just lurk, lurk and lurk moar. Acquire your information through due diligence and then present your cycle plan with stats and macro diet plan -- The guys on there will help you out tremendously if you take the time to find most of the preliminary information first.<br /><br />As for oral, Winstrol makes a tab that is comparable to the inject but its not a great solo steroid like a Test (Cyp, Susp, Etha) -- It&#039;s great to add onto another substance as a stack. Its main use is to tighten the muscle fibers and reduce the bloating puffy that accompanies a mass gaining cycle. <br /><br />The number one thing they&#039;ll keep recommending you to do is get into the Diet and Nutrition sub forum and get your daily/weekly macros set in stone after you find your BMR, TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and BF%<br /><br />The inject is intramuscular and a very small needle -- its as easy as pulling the side of your buttcheek and popping at a 45 degree angle, very easy and nearly pain free<br />

				years ago i was afraid of needles- getting my blood drawn or getting a shot would just totally creep me the fuck out.&nbsp; i have injected myself now for many years, and still if i have to get blood drawn or get a shot it creeps me the fuck out.&nbsp; there is just something about doing it yourself that is so much easier.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know why.&nbsp; plus if you inject in the thigh like any sensible person would, there are so few nerves there that if you are using a 23 gauge or smaller needle you will either not feel it AT ALL, or you will barely feel a little bit of a pinch.&nbsp; i read somewhere about a guy who was using the same 18 gauge needle to draw from the vial and inject.&nbsp; what the fucking hell?&nbsp; that is like putting a damn sharpened copper pipe in your fucking body.&nbsp; what is wrong with these people?&nbsp; use a tiny damn needle.&nbsp; 25 gauge is really good for injecting but it&#039;s a narrow tube so it will take a bit longer.&nbsp; that is the whole point of drawing out of the vial with an 18 gauge (huge) needle, and then switching&nbsp; to a small needle like 23 gauge to inject.&nbsp; you can draw out really fast because of the size of the 18gauge, and the tiny size of the 23 gauge or 25 gauge means no pain.&nbsp; personally i can use a 25 gauge to inject but the 23 gauge is just right as far as balance how big it is with how long it takes to inject.&nbsp; with a super tiny 25 gauge it just takes too long to get the shot done.&nbsp; <br /><br />as far as stanozolol (Winstrol) goes, yeah it is true that the injectable and the pill are both the same in terms of liver toxicity, but they are nothing to brag about.&nbsp; i sell it and i really like the effect, but i might be a little different than some here in that i don&#039;t ever drink and virtually never do any kind of drugs.&nbsp; i have some leeway with my liver.&nbsp; im not saying that a 4-6 week cycle with winstrol is going to destroy your liver because it absolutely will not IF you are running sensible dosages.&nbsp; but also don&#039;t kid yourself- it is the most hepatoxic steroid out there.&nbsp; if you want mild then definitely Anavar is the way to go.&nbsp; side effects are virtually nil.&nbsp; it is a great cutting steroid, it is oral, and it will build solid muscle.<br /><br />it is a myth that an oral-only cycle will prevent you from keeping gains, but i do agree that you should stack testosterone with an oral for a &quot;better&quot; cycle than an oral alone.&nbsp; here is the problem with making such sweeping generalizations though- everyone has different goals, different issues with their training, sleep, diet, and level of commitment to the lifestyle.&nbsp; but as far as losing what you gain from orals- the main reason that this myth came about is because virtually nobody who does an oral-only cycle has any clue what PCT (post-cycle therapy) is at all.&nbsp; they don&#039;t know about a suppressed HPTA, they have no idea how to address a problem that they don&#039;t know exists in the first place.&nbsp; so hell yes they lose all their gains.&nbsp; plus they make poor choices about dosage, they drink on cycle, and they take the advice of some bro from the gym who thinks he knows what is going on.&nbsp; bad choices or good choices you decide what will become of your cycle!!!!!<br /><br />i just wanna repeat that- dont wanna be a dickhead or sound like anybody&#039;s dad but bad choices or good choices you decide what becomes of your cycle.&nbsp; beginners are generally better off fine-tuning their workout before they jump in with steroids.&nbsp; you don&#039;t get nearly as much out of steroids if you do not already have a great workout plan, and forget diet.&nbsp; lousy workout plan AND lousy diet, and you want to do steroids?&nbsp; let me list a clue for $5 and you can buy it.&nbsp; Hahhahaha see there i go again sounding like a dick but seriously guys sleep 9+ hours.&nbsp; eat brazil nuts, extra virgin olive oil, chicken breasts, almonds, plenty of green leafy vegetables, and drink fat free milk.&nbsp; i drink the fuck out of milk when i am on cycle.&nbsp; it is ridiculous.&nbsp; but i have also gained serious fucking meat on cycle and there is a correlation there.&nbsp; eat egg whites.&nbsp; one yolk per day is more than enough.&nbsp; the whites you can eat and eat and eat and it will turn into muscle.&nbsp; do your fucking squats and deadlifts!!!&nbsp; i know nobody else in the gym is doing them and i don&#039;t care.&nbsp; nobody else is doing them because they are fucking hard.&nbsp; they are hard work, you feel like you are going to throw up if you do them right.&nbsp; you feel like something inside you is going to break.&nbsp; im not talking about doing weight that is too heavy for you.&nbsp; i am talking about putting the &quot;work&quot; into workout.&nbsp; and every guy that i know who does major, major work on squats and deadlifts and respects the exercises is huge everywhere else too.&nbsp; hmmmm why would this be so?&nbsp; well, you have to realize that major muscle groups have a lot of say in the body.&nbsp; your body needs to decide how much muscle to keep and how much fat to keep and how to spend the calories you put into it.&nbsp; guess what it decides when you are hitting the squats and deadlifts really hard?&nbsp; it decides that in order to survive it has to build more muscle.&nbsp; this is done not by telepathy, but by producint more growth hormone.&nbsp; it is not an accident that major muscle groups have more say in how much growth hormone is produced.&nbsp; they are th ones that are working hardest when you are doing the hardest work.&nbsp; do the work, get the body.&nbsp; don&#039;t do the work- play gym rat.&nbsp; you see both types in the gym.&nbsp; nothing wrong with either one- some people go to the gym to socialize, and some to get away from the wife or family, and some to lose a few pounds.&nbsp; but if you know yourself, if you know why you are there- then why not do the work?&nbsp; do the squats and the deadlifts and the compound exercises and just ignore all the bullshit that the muscle rags tell you about the latest concentration exercise that will make your biceps explode in size.&nbsp; want your biceps to explode in size?&nbsp; do squats!!!!!<br /><br />by the way the great documentary mentioned is NatGeo Science of Steroids and you can download it via torrent.&nbsp; i very highly recommend it as it tells both sides of the story very objectively, and the pro side is very consistent with what i have experienced myself on my personal journey with steroids and what i have learned over years of advising others on their cycles.&nbsp; if you have not seen &quot;Science of Steroids&quot; and you are either pro or con, i strongly recommend that you watch the show.&nbsp; it is well worth your time and no matter which side you are on you will learn something.&nbsp; another exceptional show is &quot;Bigger Stronger Faster&quot;.&nbsp; it is also downloadable free via torrent.&nbsp; it is a gripping and interesting story.<br /><br />i have only been on Silk Road as a seller for a couple of months but i sold anabolic steroids for a long time before doing it online, mostly just through friends.&nbsp; about 13 months ago i started to sell on bitcointalk.org, and you can search &quot;flaxceed&quot; on that site to find what other people thought of dealing with me there, and please look at my feedback here on Silk Road and on Black Market Reloaded.&nbsp; most of the people who come to me for steroids are looking for guidance and i really enjoy working with people to reach their goals.&nbsp; anything that you would like to do enough to sit down and make a thought-out, sensible plan about is probably very achievable.&nbsp; most people slip on the things like sleep (not enough), or diet (not enough protein, too much fat, wrong kinds of protein), or they have a lousy workout plan that doesn&#039;t force their muscles to grown.&nbsp; the body will do what it needs to do to survive.&nbsp; so force it to do what you want!&nbsp; but you have to know how to do that.&nbsp; there are still people doing steroids, even stacking three different steroids- and they are doing 12 reps of everything.&nbsp; guys, that will never get you there.&nbsp; never.&nbsp; anything that you can rep 12 times will not cause muscle hypertrophy.&nbsp; as they always say &quot;go heavy or go home&quot;.&nbsp; LOL.<br /><br />holler at me!

				Great advice in this thread!<br /><br />Everyone is afraid to juice at first, but once you start there&#039;s no going back, and not even because it can be addictive. You will love the way you feel and the results you&#039;ll see, particularly if your test is low as it is. With time, you will also realize how all the jacked dudes at the gym got that way :P<br /><br />My advice is to start with a beginner&#039;s cycle. Do test and only test! I recommend test E (Enanthate), but test C (Cypionate) works fine too. Avoid the heavier shit, especially things like Trenbolone. If you&#039;re wondering what causes the most &quot;roid rage&quot;, that would be it.<br /><br />You can shoot it in either your buttocks or your delts. I prefer the later in order to avoid hitting the sciatic nerve (rare) and also because I don&#039;t want to show off my ass cheeks to friends hahaha. Make sure you have a buddy that knows how to do these sort of IM injections. Don&#039;t count on being able to do it yourself until you&#039;re more experienced. Also, don&#039;t use a short pin. You want to get it deep into some muscle and avoid hitting any veins along the way.

				cheers Sourman!&nbsp; yes, test enanthate is the perfect first cycle.&nbsp; and yes you feel so great and make so much progress it is hard not to plan your next cycle!!!!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; i know the feeling well.&nbsp; i agree that test enanthate is about as likely as a twinkie to cause roid rage.&nbsp; remember the twinkie defence?&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; <br /><br />i consider myself hot-tempered but i am very relaxed on cycle.&nbsp; trenbolone is definitely not for beginners.&nbsp; lots of people who try it decide it isn&#039;t for them at all.&nbsp; heavy stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sour have you ever tried thighs?&nbsp; if you watch the video on youtube of the fruity guy who is in med school explaining it (he looks like he is 12- low or no testosterone!) you get a great overview.&nbsp; and you will see how he targets it to get nothing but meat.&nbsp; i have had nothing but success with this technique and remember i was terrified of needles when i started!&nbsp; by the third time it is very easy.&nbsp; five times and you feel like you could do it for a living.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; also if you do yourself in the thigh, nobody sees your ass either!!!!&nbsp;

				It is 17-alpha alkylated but not all 17aa compounds are created equal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean to say that you can not do damage to your liver but if you are sensible and use a reasonable dosage and do not drink while on cycle your odds of doing lasting harm are remote.&nbsp; Here is what isteroids.com had to say:<br /><br /><br />////////////////////////////////<br />Anavar is one of the mildest anabolic-androgenic steroids; however, you can still experience side effects with this compound. These side effects are likely to arise if you misuse or abuse Anavar.<br /><br />If you are highly sensitive to estrogen-related side effects, then Anavar is a good choice for your bodybuilding goal.

				This is not commonly suggested on the steroid boards, but if I was in your position I might consider bumping the test at the end.&nbsp; Why not enanthate by the way?&nbsp; I am just curious- nothing wrong with cyp.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t two two orals in the same stack.&nbsp; Most people do but I don&#039;t like it.&nbsp; Do the Dbol kick and leave it at that.&nbsp; If you want more muscle out of the cycle then sleep more, work harder, and eat cleaner.&nbsp; This is my opinion only.&nbsp; You could, however, add more test to the cycle in the last 1/2 after your Dbol is finished.&nbsp; For a first cycle this is not a great idea but some people do it and if you have done the first 6 weeks on test and have no sides or are managing them well with an anti-estrogen like Nolvadex then I like that idea better than another oral.&nbsp; <br /><br />You run into the problem of not knowing where the gains are coming from, falsely attributing them, and then blowing tons of cash for the rest of your juicing days based on some false belief.&nbsp; This is a big waste.&nbsp; I like the Dbol kick at the beginning for everyone unless it is your first cycle then stick to straight test.&nbsp; If you really must have the kick, offset it a bit.&nbsp; Start it two weeks into the cycle.&nbsp; That way you have the first two weeks to get a feel for the test, to get a sense of the amount of bloat you have from the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen, and you will have a plan in place to manage that if needed perhaps with Nolvadex or Arimidex.&nbsp; Do your Dbol at that point, weeks 3-6.&nbsp; Take the beginning two weeks to watch your sides from straight test and to fine-tune your mental preparation.&nbsp; Go over the phrases about food like &quot;tuna is great for me now&quot; and &quot;fried rice is a bad choice if I want to build muscle&quot; and &quot;protein that is metabolically available will grow muscle faster&quot;.&nbsp; This is mental preparation and the more you work these phrases into your daily self-talk the more succesful you will be.&nbsp; &quot;That is high in simple carbohydrates; that is not consistent with my goals.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone wants to do all the tweaking with chemicals but that is over-thinking it.&nbsp; Why not do straight test (add the Dbol if this is your 2nd, 3rd+ cycle) but work as hard on your mind as you do on your body?&nbsp; Your mind will lie to you about how heavy the weights are, and how many reps you can do.&nbsp; The mind will say &quot;I need to take it easy now; rest is good for me.&quot;&nbsp; Rest really is good and that is why you are sleeping 9 hours per night.&nbsp; But resting 3 minutes (or 5-6 minutes!) is not rest.&nbsp; It is not consistent with your goals.&nbsp; Can you tell yourself &quot;I need 30 seconds between sets because I want to have a great cycle.&quot;&nbsp; Can you make that a mantra, and know it and live it?&nbsp; Sorry, the professional bodybuilders that I know don&#039;t think nearly as much about steroids as the first-time or second-time cycle crowd.&nbsp; I know it is exciting and you are eager to put together the best stack you can to get the most gains.&nbsp; I feel you.&nbsp; But head-to-head, the man who masters his mind will always grow more muscle than you if all of your focus is on juice.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are not keeping a food diary, you might not be ready for steroids.&nbsp; I know that is controversial, and many people don&#039;t want to hear it.&nbsp; But many people write to me with an almost impossibly skinny form who expect that steroids will make them look like Jay Cutler.&nbsp; They don&#039;t need steroids at all.&nbsp; They need a food diary and the information to make great choices day in and day out.&nbsp; If you are too fat, trenbolone and anavar are not the solution, cardio is.&nbsp; People who think like bodybuilders make great bodybuilders.&nbsp; People who think like fat people make great fat people.&nbsp; People who think like skinny people make great skinny people.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it funny that someone selling steroids is telling you that they are probably not what you need?&nbsp; Some of you might be 16 and you pretend to be 25 1/2 and you want juice so badly you can taste it!&nbsp; What you need is carrot juice, and lean proteins, and green leafy vegetables, and to sleep more and get more truly lean, metabolically available protein like tuna.&nbsp; You need to examine your self-talk and see if you are beating yourself into the ground, see if you are telling yourself that you aren&#039;t a bodybuilder at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is very easy to sell protein powder because people think that it turns into muscle, and it is a very simple idea that is easy to use and tastes good.&nbsp; You sit on the edge of your seats for that latest, greatest formulation of pre-workout, mid-workout, post-workout mix that will make all the difference.&nbsp; You are reaching for your wallet and you want it!&nbsp; Sell it to me!!! But if I told you I wanted to train your mind to think like a bodybuilder, your wallet would go right back into your pocket and the room would quickly empty out.&nbsp; You don&#039;t believe that your mind controls what happens to you, and that is why you will fail to achieve any lasting gains no matter the cycle you choose.&nbsp; Why not start with 1,000mg per injection twice per week?&nbsp; Two grams of testosterone per week or maybe three grams?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; 3,000mg per week of test.&nbsp; I will be like a superhero.&nbsp; But if our mind is not ready you will not do the work.&nbsp; You will not write down the foods you eat.&nbsp; You will not write down your workouts.&nbsp; You will not analyze this information to find your mistakes, and to find your weaknesses and strengths.&nbsp; You will not do squats and deadlifts.&nbsp; They are too hard.&nbsp; I want big arms!!!!&nbsp; So you work those concentration curls like mad!&nbsp; Wait- shouldn&#039;t I be getting huge biceps?&nbsp; I&#039;m taking the testosterone.&nbsp; I learned how to inject myself!!!&nbsp; Where are the gains?&nbsp; Steroids are just not the magic bullet that you think.&nbsp; Training your mind, and learning all that you can about nutrition and living a super-clean life are what it is about.&nbsp; That is how you make great gains.&nbsp; Can you put away the Wii or X-box and go to sleep at 10PM?&nbsp; What about 8PM?&nbsp; People who train their mind find it much easier to make the right choices.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t mean to come off like a grumpy old man, but actually I am pretty much a grumpy old man.&nbsp; I have made ALL of the mistakes with anabolic steroids, diet, poor sleep, alcohol, lack of commitment.&nbsp; I have made all of the mistakes that you will make over the next 20 years!&nbsp; Don&#039;t do what I did.&nbsp; I had a good coach in the beginning who was telling me all that I am telling you.&nbsp; But I was too much of a tough guy, and he was too conservative.&nbsp; I thought that my way was going to get me huge, and his way would keep me safe and small.&nbsp; I was so stupid!&nbsp; Train your mind.&nbsp; Don&#039;t make the mistakes of others before you- there is no excuse for that.&nbsp; Don&#039;t say nobody told you because I am telling you now.&nbsp; Go easy on the dosages, go easy on the hepatoxic orals.&nbsp; Watch your blood pressure if that is an issue for you with testosterone.&nbsp; Get a proper lipid panel.&nbsp; Steroids will reduce your HDL, or good cholesterol, and increase your LDL, or bad cholesterol.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want you to ever say that nobody told you that steroids are serious.&nbsp; I am telling you.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do this half-assed because you will get burned.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you train your mind, bodybuilding will fall into place.&nbsp; Your relationships will fall into place.&nbsp; Your career will fall into place.&nbsp; With plenty of extra money from all of this success you can buy steroids.&nbsp; For now do straight testosterone, watch your blood pressure and cholesterol, and eat well including making a food diary.&nbsp; Do compound exercises and hit the squats and deadlifts hard!&nbsp; Do them because they are hard.&nbsp; That is training the mind.&nbsp; Bodybuilders who master this can take the hard classes in school because, simply- they are hard.&nbsp; Dumb or smart is not the issue but training the mind.&nbsp; Chemistry is a hard class in high school, and organic chemistry is hard in college.&nbsp; If you train your mind you can get an &quot;A&quot; in both.&nbsp; Nobody in high school or college needs steroids.&nbsp; Train your mind.&nbsp; Use all that natural testosterone and channel it with perfect form on your lifts, and when you are 25 or 30 or 40 and still doing those picture-perfect squats you can hit the testosterone and the Dbol then.&nbsp; Maybe you will even get up to the Trenbolone Hexa with a side of Winstrol.&nbsp; If steroids look like an easy way to get what you want, you are de-training your mind.&nbsp; You are doing the opposite of what you need.<br /><br />

Im sorry but the word bump could be used in both senses<br />thanks<br />ben<br /><br />P.S. i was considering anavar more to lean out at end of cycle and for strength gains more so then gaining muscle

				LOL sorry to be so wordy BenC.&nbsp; And that was more in general- not directed at you specifically.&nbsp; Yes, by bump I mean increase the dosage of the test.&nbsp; Test is incredibly effective as a muscle builder.&nbsp; If you were doing 250mg per injection twice per week, and again all signs were go with no issues regarding blood pressure or too much bloat- 500mg per injection would be fine.&nbsp; Just watch your blood pressure closely from the time you bump the dosage.&nbsp; Yes, the cypionate ester is very close in chemical structure to the enanthate ester.&nbsp; But in practical purposes any mistake that you make with cypionate will be be harder to manage than a mistake with enanthate!!!!&nbsp; With enanthate the testosterone is separating from the ester at a faster rate than cypionate, and is exerting its influence on the endocrine system faster.&nbsp; This means that if you make a mistake it will clear your system in a relatively short period of time and as long as you can manage the bloat or blood pressure in the meantime all is well.&nbsp; With cypionate you have the ester and the testosterone linked together for longer, they are taking longer to separate and this means your serum levels will be prolonged when compared to enanthate.&nbsp; You still have to manage any issues that come up but you have to manage them longer.&nbsp; It might mean that for a longer period of time you have to really focus on limiting your salt, using &quot;no salt&quot;, eating avocados, eating honeydew melons, and taking extraordinary measures to like blood pressure medication.<br /><br />This is only one example.&nbsp; If you are experienced with testosterone over one or more cycles, you are not concerned much about this.&nbsp; If this is your first cycle you will want to keep a close eye on how your body responds to the test, and you want to be more conservative when you bump the dosage to a higher level.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, I am speaking in general and not specifically to you Ben.&nbsp; You might have done more cycles than me!&nbsp; OK, maybe not that many.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; &nbsp;But you might know exactly how test reacts in your body.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t just be conservative and check your blood pressure morning and night and pay attention to diet and watch for bloat- most of all, have a good anti-esterogen available if you need it.&nbsp; Your body sees so much testosterone and aromitization is a logical next step- to convert it to estrogen.&nbsp; Then you have the bloat, the high blood pressure, the elevate heart rate, and this steroid thing is not so much fun any longer.&nbsp; But a single dose of arimidex can get you back in order generally, or Nolvadex.&nbsp;

				I forgot to say that IMHO, Anavar will not give you strength gains.&nbsp; I am sure you can point to experienced people who say otherwise but my experience is that it doesn&#039;t work nearly as well as testosterone for increasing strength and in essence you are wasting money on the Anavar at the end of the cycle.&nbsp; Again this is my humble opinion- other will have a different set of experiences to relate to you and you should weigh them all carefully to decide.&nbsp; Also I think you will find it much easier to lean out after the cypionate has cleared and you are off cycle, or you are doing a bridge with another steroid.&nbsp; An effective PCT though is a good way to keep gains and get on to your next goal.&nbsp; I think everyone wants to gain mass and lean out in the same cycle but in reality I&#039;ve only seen the very, very experienced manage to do this well- and consistently.&nbsp; And for them this pursuit is full-time.&nbsp; If you know your body and you know how you respond to different compounds though you might pull it off.&nbsp; The body tends to understand feast or famine but not both at once.&nbsp; This goes for the digestive system, the endocrine system, the electrolyte level, etc.&nbsp; The body knows how to conserve and can do it well.&nbsp; The body knows how to spend (resources like calories, proteins, electrolytes) too and can do it well.&nbsp; When you try to do both at the same time the system has opposing forces.&nbsp; The thyroid is pulling one way and the kidneys and digestive system the other way.&nbsp; Again if you know your strengths and weaknesses and how you respond to compounds this is manageable but it is NOT easy.&nbsp; I say bulk with a bulking cycle and lean out later.

				I can&#039;t stress to you too much on how much research you need to do before going down this route, most guys buy a bottle or somepills blow up and then lost it all without proper Post Cycle Therapy, I personally don&#039;t recommend guys seriously considering using gear until their 21 and have been lifting and dieting hard for a few years and have reached their genetic plateau, I&#039;ve been on since 99 and alot i&#039;ve learned the hard way, there is no safe drug, everything you put in your body has consequences and side effects no matter what everyone says, also certain people react much better to different stacks so their is a personal trial and error method that must be undertaken if your serious about it. it requires alot of dedication to training and even more to eating the right foods at the right times. My humble opinion is steriods if used properly and moderatly by grown adult aren&#039;t even close to be as dangerous as the media portrays them.&nbsp; Take some time do your homework and don&#039;t go buying shit out of some dudes trunk at the gym, know what you want to try and why whether its for bulking or cutting and then make the best informed decision possible realizing you&#039;ll make mistakes along the way that are part of the learning curve.&nbsp; Hope this helps.

				Most do it for the energy boost as it helps the body produce more red blood cells.&nbsp; Since these cells carry oxygen to the muscles it is believed to allow you to push longer and harder as well.&nbsp; The limitations imposed by our physiology dictates that only so much oxygen can be carried to the muscles, and of course muscles have more strength and stamina if their oxygen supply is adequate.&nbsp; Like the so-called &quot;training effect&quot; that makes the body more efficient through workouts demonstrates, our limitations are always being tested and re-assigned.&nbsp; &nbsp;By raising the bar for the amount of red blood cells available, b12 lets you work your muscles harder and increases their efficiency.<br /><br />This is not unlike blood doping.&nbsp; Most people think of steroids when someone says blood doping but it is nothing of the sort.&nbsp; It is just taking your own blood out and storing it, and then right before competition putting it back in your body.&nbsp; You will have a higher concentration of red blood cells which gives you a competitive advantage.&nbsp; Most athletes who utilize blood doping also inject b12 for obvious reasons.&nbsp; The whole name of the game is getting as much stamina as possible and between the extra cells that they carry and the b12 that helps them utilize them they enhance their competitive advantage even more.&nbsp;

				Agree on the prohormones.&nbsp; Another thing to consider is mesterolone.&nbsp; It is very mild- it will not shut down your nuts (stop them from producing testsosterone) so you don&#039;t have to buy a ton of other products to do PCT (post cycle therapy).&nbsp; You can use mesterolone for 4 weeks and then stop.&nbsp; You will see results.&nbsp; I list it on SR and it is very chea.&nbsp; Find it here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e3b3b83ba2<br /><br />It is called Mesviron 25, and it is a human grade product made by Unigen, who has a license from the Thai FDA.&nbsp; They are an actual Thai pharmaceutical company and if you go to the doctor here with a low sperm count you doctor might prescribe this drug to beef up your swimmers.&nbsp; That is a word of warning if you are sexually active- WRAP YOUR FUCKING PACKAGE because when you are taking Mesviron she will get pregnant if you just look at her fondly.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; This is not like &quot;real&quot; steroids that totally shut down natural testosterone production and during use you are sterile.&nbsp; Yes, that&#039;s right- on cycle with testosterone&nbsp; you will not get your partner pregnant.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think you have this kind of freedom on Mesviron- you don&#039;t!<br /><br />And Ben- to me phentermine is a pretty strong stimulant and it feels very much like an amphetamine.&nbsp; And no- it is definitely not for long-term use!&nbsp; In fact, when doctors prescribe it to the morbidly obese, they generally limit it to 12 weeks.&nbsp; But is it nice?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Will it kill your appetite?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Can you sleep only 2 hours and get up for work with vim and vigor if you take one or two with your morning coffee?&nbsp; Fuck yes you can.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just as an aside, I am about to list two brand new steroids today for the first time.&nbsp; One is oral turinabol, and the other is oral halotestin.&nbsp; These are both fairly rare steroids- they are definitely not easy to find.&nbsp; Turinabol is called &quot;Dbol light&quot; sometimes if that gives you an idea of its applications.&nbsp; And Halotestin, or fluoxymesterone, is a favorite among powerlifters and endurance athletes.&nbsp; It is some good stuff!<br /><br />

				Apcalis is just Cialis but made by Ajanta of India.&nbsp; Exact same chemical.&nbsp; Works just like Cialis- the weekend pill- does.&nbsp; The Kamagra jelly packs have 100mg sildenafil, just like Viagra.&nbsp; I think the jelly hits you a little faster than the pills.&nbsp; <br /><br />Phentermine might make concentration worse.&nbsp; I don&#039;t notice that myself, but it has been said about this drug.

				Great recommendations Organon.&nbsp; I also highly recommend NatGeo Science of Steroids.&nbsp; It is available as a torrent download.&nbsp; <br /><br />Diet, sleep, and proper training are 95% of it.&nbsp; Everyone wants to believe that they can do 5% of the work and hit the juice and get what they want, but the reality is if you do 5% of the work you will always look like you do just that.&nbsp; Steroids are no substitute for hard work, lots of sleep, and a clean diet.

				I know I&#039;m late in the thread but I&#039;m just going to say this. <br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck around with steroids. Even just lower dose cycle for a week can severely fuck up natural bodily functions. Especially in males, you can really screw up your natural test production. It is really important to get a blood test before and after a cycle to make sure levels of certain bodily chemicals are back in balance. Also, if you&#039;re under 21, just no way I would say taking steroids is a good idea. On top of the already fairly large risks of juicing, you can permanently fuck up parts of your still developing body. <br /><br />Most importantly, don&#039;t even consider steroids if you aren&#039;t training and eating properly. I would recommend you get 6 months at least into a routine of some sort before running a cycle. Injecting test into your ass isn&#039;t going to make muscle magically appear. Work for it first, use steroids as a tool, not a way out. Still, I would do it safely/naturally if all possible. <br /><br />/rant<br /><br />Just do your research and weigh your pros/cons<br /><br /><br />

Even just lower dose cycle for a week can severely fuck up natural bodily functions. Especially in males, you can really screw up your natural test production. It is really important to get a blood test before and after a cycle to make sure levels of certain bodily chemicals are back in balance. Also, if you&#039;re under 21, just no way I would say taking steroids is a good idea. On top of the already fairly large risks of juicing, you can permanently fuck up parts of your still developing body. <br /><br />Most importantly, don&#039;t even consider steroids if you aren&#039;t training and eating properly. I would recommend you get 6 months at least into a routine of some sort before running a cycle. Injecting test into your ass isn&#039;t going to make muscle magically appear. Work for it first, use steroids as a tool, not a way out. Still, I would do it safely/naturally if all possible. <br /><br />/rant<br /><br />Just do your research and weigh your pros/cons<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />At first i was like &quot; here come the moral police&quot; but then i was like &#039;&quot; well said, have a +1 sir&quot;

				Snipee I get questions all the time from people who have been lifting for two weeks and who are just sure that all they need is some juice and they will be huge in a month.&nbsp; I also hear from a lot of people who have no clue what PCT is.&nbsp; The ones that really scare me are already using testosterone and deca and trenbolone and they have no idea what it is, what it does, how or why it works, what the side effects may be- etc.&nbsp; This is very scary!

				Question:&nbsp; Has anyone heard a well-reasoned argument for using a steroid other than testosterone for a first cycle?<br /><br />Question:&nbsp; Do you agree or disagree that an oral-only cycle is never appropriate?

				I&#039;ve seen all the usual steroid use, testosterone and human growth hormones jabbed into the ass, it was £50 a vial back in the 80s. Russian. Shudder to think were it comes from!<br /><br />Getting into the right frame of mind is essential. I know guys who used high doses of steroids and coke which seemed to mess up relationships. Hard to party and train all the time but easy to party every wk end and push the boat out every so often.<br /><br />I&#039;d use some testosterone perhaps. Perk me up a little sometimes.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Anabolic steroids and pretty much any illicit drug is a bad combination imho.&nbsp; If you want to get your money&#039;s worth out of your cycle you have to put 110% into it- sleep 9 hours a night, eat perfectly clean, avoid any alcohol, tobacco, etc- and drink a ton of water throughout the day.&nbsp; I have never had roid rage despite long-term steroid usage but adding cocaine to testosterone is surely a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; I can imagine he wasn&#039;t every woman&#039;s dream with that combination.&nbsp; People truly underestimate how powerful testosterone is.&nbsp;
