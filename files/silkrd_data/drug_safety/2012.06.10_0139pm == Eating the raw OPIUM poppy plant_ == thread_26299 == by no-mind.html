				Hello there good folks!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been drug curious for a couple of years, but never knew where to get them from. I&#039;ve never taken drugs before, I&#039;m not at all experienced, so please be patient with me and detailed in your replies. <br /><br />Here goes the story: I got lucky this morning and found at the roadside on the edge of a field a bunch of opium poppies. Picked up a few stalks and took them home. I compared them with the pictures on the internet and everything matches: the blue-ish colour, the shape of the leaves, the white sap. I&#039;m absolutely sure that what I have is the Papaver Somniferum, the OPIUM POPPY plant.<br /><br />I thought I&#039;d try it. I gave two quick licks to two trickling sap drops. To be honest I didn&#039;t feel any noticeable effect; perhaps a bit of euphoria, but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s due to the poppy or to my being glad I found it (a sort of placebo). I&#039;m going to lick some more. Maybe even chew. Please advise me how much quantity it is safe for to lick / chew on the poppy! I&#039;ve read on Wikipedia that on oral administration, it takes some 10 minutes until it goes through the stomach and you get to feel the effects, so I&#039;m fearful not to ingest too much, thinking that I&#039;m not feeling anything, in those 10-15 minutes and then when it kicks in to realize I overdosed. To put it short: what quantity of raw (not dried) opium poppy is safe to ingest to get high, but not overdose?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m currently visiting family and staying at their home for a few days. I am not sure I want to try the opium poppies now, but rather wait until I leave here, as I don&#039;t really want my family to see me high or know that I&#039;m trying drugs. How could I preserve the poppy stalks for a few days? Put them in a bag in the fridge to keep fresh? (I have my own portable mini-fridge with me, so there&#039;s no risk of having them discovered) Let them dry? Won&#039;t they lose potency if they dry? Or maybe even attempt to collect the sap and discard the rest - how could I do that? Wouldn&#039;t that be wasteful?

				I don&#039;t have any experience with opium but I&#039;ve never heard of eating the sap. Aren&#039;t you supposed to boil it into a tea?

				If it is possible I woulds go back to where those plats stand and cut the seedbox after the flower leaves have fallen off.<br /><br />Leaves do not contain alkaloids or morphine.<br />Only the sap contains that.<br />Keep the sap and throw the rest away.<br /><br />Once you have cut the plant, the pressure will drop, so the sap is not coming out the cuts anymore.<br />Cut to harvest will do the same.<br />You will have to cut the fresh seedbox of a fresh plant.<br />So if you have already harvested the plants, you can throw them away, along with the carbidge.<br /><br /><br /><br />I used to do the same thing.<br /><br />After you gave the cut, catch those drops immediately and spread the sap on your knife-blade.<br />Take a large cleaver, so you have a nice big surface on your knife to spread those drops on.<br /><br />After you have a reasonable amount, then put your knife in the sun(beam) so the sap can dry.<br />Opium never get&#039;s dry like a Afghan hashisch, it will always stick to your fingers.<br /><br />Sometimes you will be needing 0.5 gr to have the nicest dreams, sometimes 1 gr or more.<br />Depending on the percentages of morphine.<br />For such a amount you will need to cut a 100 plants or so, to be sure of a good trip in your mind.<br /><br />It is normal that you will vomit after the first few times of using.<br />Not only if you eat the opium, but after smoking it too.<br />Try to dose the amount so you will stop vomiting after you have nothing to through up anymore.<br />It is not nice to have stomic contractions again and again, even if you have nothing to vomit anymore.<br />It can make you really tired.<br /><br />Best thing is to smoke the opium in a waterpipe or a bong filled with water.<br />Opium smoking will feel hot in your throat.<br /><br />Have fun!<br />It will be a great experience!

				Actually, you can cut a pod multiple times.&nbsp; I have had best results if I did the cutting in the early evening.&nbsp; If you make 4-5 longitudinal cuts @ 1mm depth; just enough to pierce the skin and then come back the following morning the latex is very easy to scrape off.&nbsp; At this point you can make 4-5 more longitudinal cuts on different areas of the pod and come back and collect the next day.&nbsp; The most I have done this to a single pod was four times and that was on a batch of Giganteums I was growing.&nbsp; Some of the smaller ones you will not have as much luck with.<br /><br />There are also a few somniferums out there that have very low, almost non-existent amounts of alkaloids.&nbsp; The Hungarian purples I can tell you from experience pack almost no punch.&nbsp; Making tea out of approx 20 med size pods just gave me a tummy ache.<br /><br />One more thing.&nbsp; It is true the leaves have nothing in them worth getting at but the stems do.&nbsp; If I were you I would just whack down the entire plant, strip the leaves, hang them to dry and then make tea.<br /><br />Also, after you dry them you can remove the seeds and in the early spring or whenever last frost is in your area, go around and Johnny Poppyseed the shit out of your neighborhood/town.

				I Johnny Poppyseeded (love the term) the fuck out of several local parks, several thousand seeds over a few weeks but not seen any results so far but the scrub is getting pretty big, I&#039;ll just have to wait and see.&nbsp; ;D<br />IME pap som giants grow prolifically although ive no idea about their content, whites are stubborn fuckers but have high content, hens and chicks are moderately easy and have good content.<br />On a happy note I&#039;ve got a few nice breeds growing successfully in my garden.&nbsp; ;D <br />Bring on the harvest! I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll post about it here if its not a huge failure.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				My neighbor grows P.somniferums every year and he seems to be quite a happy fellow.&nbsp; He said you can sometimes grow the kind of seed you buy at the grocery store but sometimes they are sterile and won&#039;t germinate, and even if you can grow them, they are very low in alkaloid content. He said that you can buy real P. som. seed online, varieties like Afghani pinks (used for illegal opium production), Tasmanian, Turkish commercial (used for commercial legal opium production), Hens and Chicks, Indian white and his favorite, P. Giganthemum. He takes the seed from the strongest and biggest of his plants and dries them for the next years planting, so each year he is effectively selecting for the very best, and even one mature pod can produce as many as 1000 viable seeds. My neighbor says making tea with the pods is the way to go. Trying to harvest opium is tedious and highly illegal, whereas growing the beautiful plants is legal, here at least. You could cut a couple of pods and let them drip the sap into a glass of water, then drink it. The bitterness will turn to joy shortly. You could also score a pod or two and then collect the sap onto a rolling paper for future use, or just eat a few drops of the sap. The tea is the best way to go, safer for legal reasons and for dosage titration reasons as well. And trying to reduce the tea down to something smokable will be a lot of work and the result will be very very disappointing. Commercial opium producers use the whole plant, but that is mostly to allow mechanized harvest. My neighbor says that when his plants are mature, he cuts them down, after they have not been watered for a week, and hangs them upside down to dry, just like you would with onions. Then, over 90% of the sap, loaded with alkaloids, is in the pod and the last 4 inches of stem at the pod end, so that is what he uses to make his tea, after seed is removed and collected for drying.&nbsp; My neighbor has been doing this for many years and he seems to know what he is talking about.

				Harvesting poppies is an interesting concept.<br /><br />First of all you should note that the morphine levels vary greatly between species and cultivars - some contain virtually none, while the kind used for heroin production has extremely large morphine levels. Something that is a somniferum species does not have to have a very high concentration, but will definitely contain some morphine in the sap.<br /><br />As for harvesting, scouring the poppy before it flowers and collecting and drying the sap is the default method. You can, however, also cut off the head and dry that, to make &#039;tea&#039; from later. It will not be as potent, but still effective. I&#039;ve even heard of people getting a bit of a high by simply picking poppy heads for a while - it can be potent stuff.<br /><br />On the risks: if you ingest opium, the onset of effects will be much slower compared to shooting it up, and you should really wait 15 to 30 minutes after ingesting a dose before trying a larger one. There really is no ballpark figure to give for the amount required as the concentration varies so wildly between cultivars. Plants that look virtually identical can yield very different levels, and there really is no way to tell without lab analysis. <br /><br />

The full effects of opium tea take two or three hours to reach their peak and it will be the same for taking any natural poppy product orally. It&#039;s very easy to think nothing is happening only to find it comes on strong given a couple of hours.

				I licked some more of the sap last evening, twisting the stems to bring out the plant&#039;s juice. It didn&#039;t take long until I started feeling &quot;funny&quot; in my head - an indescribable sensation, along with nice tickling in my back and tights and very, very sleepy. It didn&#039;t feel like euphoria though, just extreme sleepiness in the end. I slept soundly last night. Very restful sleep.<br /><br />One thing: I didn&#039;t actually swallow anything, just licked the sap with the tip of my tongue, very small amounts. It must have absorbed through my mouth tissue. The effect came in seconds.
