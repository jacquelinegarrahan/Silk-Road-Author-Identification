				I am on opium tea and using for my first time. I have used roughly 5g to make a cup. I Drank half of the cup after making the tea ( description below of method ) waited an hour and drank the rest it is now 2 hours in, I feel flush a little doped but nothing else. What should I do? Should I just make another cup from the already used slush? should I add some new opium tea to the slush and make another cup? <br /><br />To make<br /><br />I soaked the the 5g in a little lemon juice for 10 min<br />I then added hot water and stir<br />I left for 30mins stir again<br />left for another 30mins Then poured and drank half the cup.<br /><br /><br />I did get a flush effect after an hour but nothing much more than that hence I drank the other half.<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />

				Morphine is destroyed by vaporization at 82.6 degrees Celsius so you definitely don&#039;t want the water to be too hot (ie: definitely not boiling).<br /><br />Opinions are mixed on whether hot or cold water extraction works best, although I&#039;ve always got great results by doing a CWE.<br />You shouldn&#039;t just stir, I always recommend shaking vigorously. Get a two liter soda bottle and put the finely crushed pods in there, add a little lemon juice and either hot (but not too hot) or cold water. Put the cap back on, Shake Shake and Shake some more until your hand starts to hurt. Poke holes in the lid with a tack or a safety pin and squeeze the liquid into a cup (this way no coffee filter is required.)<br /><br />You can still get alkaloids by doing a second and sometimes third wash on the material. This works with poppy pods as well as 1lb+ of poppy seeds.<br /><br />

				Thank you for the tip. The first tea I used water that I had boiled and let stand for 1 min.<br /><br />I am making another cup with the slush from the first plus another 2g (the 2g has been soaked in lemon for 10 mins)<br /><br />I have just added that together with hot water ( boiled around 10 mins ago, I can put my finger in and it is warm not really hot )<br /><br />I have added this mixture in a bottle and am shaking it now.<br /><br />I would like to get a good buzz, so my plan is to have one more cup after an hour this time if this cup does not do it for me.<br /><br /><br />I am trying this out for the first time so being cautious <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah sounds like the water was too hot in the first batch. You likely destroyed most of the alkaloids.

				To get all the alkaloids I prefer the typical tincture (alcoholic extract).<br />Put the pods in 100% proof&nbsp; (50% alcohol IMO is the best, since it is half water/half alcohol extract) vodka or whatever else, and keep it there at last 48 hours, better a week/ten days if you can.<br />In this way you waste nothing of the pods and if&nbsp; you want to drink in a tea just put some drops (the amount depends on how much alcohol you use, I usually put enough just to cover the pods, that it is roughly a 1:5 extract, and if you have no opium tolerance about 10 drops would be enough) in tepid water (so that the alcohol evaporates) and you are ready to go. I usually like to put the drops in a tablespoon of sugar, it is a very good tool to have the typical morphine dreams.<br /><br />There&#039;s either a recipe for Laudanum (that it&#039;s made in the same way, only with more alcohol - gin in this case - and sugar added) that you can find here.

				Cold Water Extraction, basically a technical term for using cold water in the same procedure you did instead of hot... Damn, reading this thread is making me want some opiates, its been a really long time.

				I have to be honest I am very disappointed so far. I had some weed at the weekend and I would say that was so much better than what I am feeling now. I have not had weed for about 10 years up until this weekend and I was so buzzed.<br /><br />I normally do coke but thought I would give tea a go.

				If you destroy or degenerate the alkaloids the tea will suck.<br />Do a tincture, you will retrieve all of them easily that way and you need much less (just because you extract ALL the alkaloids from the pods instead than roughly 10-15% with a normal tea).<br /><br />You cannot be disappointed from the pods, if the extraction is correct the effect is very similar to opium.

				i&#039;ve got to say, 5g of opium tea is NOT very much, especially if you&#039;re an experienced opiate user. i would guess i used closer to an ounce of pod powder per cup of tea i used to drink, but then again i had a hefty tolerance and a large supply of poppy pods. <br /><br />and, i used to simmer, almost-boil my tea. every time. after i dumped just-boiled water onto my ground pods in a big pitcher with a few tablespoons of lemon juice, (about 1 cup pods, 1.5-2 cups JUST BOILED water) i&#039;d let it sit, stirring every few minutes, for at least 30-45min. then, after straining, i&#039;d simmer it down to as little liquid as possible over an hour or two. i never experienced very diminished effects from accidentally boiling for a minute or two; a few times i&#039;d nod out and accidentally boil for a lot longer than that (granted excessive boiling did seem to affect the potency somewhat.) using 10-15 medium-sized pods got me to essentially the same place every time, whether i accidentally let the water boil or not. the one time i used lukewarm water, i didnt get anywhere NEAR as strong effects as i did with the hot water -- when i re-washed that gunk with hotter water, i got more out of it than i did the first wash. so honestly i dont think you need to worry so much about the water being too hot. eating opium and drinking opium tea was my almost-daily DOC for several years, and i never &#039;destroyed the alkaloids,&#039; at least not to the point of not being able to get high as a kite off my tea. the effects would often last up to 24hours if i made a particularly strong batch.<br /><br />re-use the pod slush you have, once. 2hours after drinking it, if you&#039;re not feeling where you want to be, i suggest taking more. 5grams of powder, i&#039;m not sure exactly how much that equates to in volume, but i generally used about 1 US cup of powder to 2 cups of water per glass of tea. that is a LOT; i would suggest maybe 1/4-1/3 cup of powder if you&#039;re experienced with opiates. if not, well, try doubling your first dose next time.<br /><br />also i suggest using a clean sock or foot of pantyhose to strain the tea. put the sock in a tall cup, wrap the leg-part of the sock around the rim of the cup. dump pod goo into sock. pick up sock, strain out. WAY easier than trying to use a coffee filter; the only danger in this is that i&#039;ve burned my hands fairly badly while doing a second wash on my pod gunk, because of the heat of the water and the effects of the first wash.

				Thank you for your replies. I think I was expecting more of a rush for the tea I was a little buzzed which I noticed more when I went to bed and just chilled. I think all in all I had done about 15grams. As a first time user I had read a lot and seen that strength can vary in the product so I was being careful. I would say the first half a cup was the best as I felt warmth in my face but my eye did not pin at all and over all I felt normal. <br /><br />I did not sleep a lot last night but I feel great this morning and do not have any side effects either during or after. I was expecting to feel a little sick or throw up as a first time user.

				I am trying again this afternoon. I have made up the tea yesterday around about double and have it a bottle that I keep shaking vigorously in hope that it breaks it down a bit better. I will let you all know how I get on.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />&nbsp;

				One step may have been missed. Try to grind the poppy heads/straw into a powder. mortar and pestle for small dry lots, or a blender for some moisture in the pods. Larger surface are = larger alkaloid extraction.<br /><br />Shut the kettle off before boiling, add till the poppy powder is just covered, add a good squirt of lemon juice. <br />Then sit for at least 15 minutes, overnight sometimes<br />Squeeze the liquid out using a cloth or tea-towel. <br />Mix 50%-50% with an orange juice and drink.

As someone stated 5g is a little low. If you managed 15g with no ill effects then maybe try that dose first time around next time. Then you can redose from the same tea slush or add more to get the opium buzz you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />Be aware there are several types of opium buzz and it can vary on your physiology and age as well.<br /><br />In my experience a smaller dose of opiates will make me buzzy, all up and active (although a bit stoned too). As I increase the doseage I will get higher pain relief and more sedation. I personally like the sedation part so I always go for a big dose.<br /><br />Working your way up will get you used to the various stages of poppy use and allow you to tailor your dose. It takes practice and experience, you&#039;re dealing with plants not pharmaceutical tablets.<br /><br />Be aware that it is easy to get a habit from poppy tea, it may well take a few months and you will be okay, okay, okay and then one day you will wake up with a monkey on your back. Please be careful and enjoy this amazing plant with respect.<br /><br />paki<br />

				+1 for pointing out the addictive potential of poppy tea, also keep in mind tolerance will build rapidly with frequent use. Its best to take at the very least a few days in between each use.
