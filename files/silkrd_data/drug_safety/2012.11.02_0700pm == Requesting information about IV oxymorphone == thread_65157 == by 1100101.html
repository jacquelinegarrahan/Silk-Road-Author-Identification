				Hey folks,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been off of opiates for about 4 years now, but I think that I want to give hatter26&#039;s liquid oxymorphone a shot (no pun) if he lists it again.<br /><br />I wanted to see if anyone could answer a couple of questions for me.&nbsp; Back when I was stopping my opiate abuse Opana was becoming more common in my part of the US. So, I had the chance to try it before I stopped, but I&#039;ve only insufflated it.&nbsp; At the time, I was doing lots of dope, etc, so I had a very, very high tolerance but it still got me high as hell even though I didn&#039;t IV it (as I was doing with other opiates at the time).<br /><br />So, I am wondering how the drug compares to hydromorphone/dope/oxy etc when IV&#039;d.&nbsp; Hydromorphone in my experience is very short acting and is only good for the rush and the high that lasts about 5 minutes after injecting.&nbsp; Dope is dope (noddy, longer lasting) and Oxy was usually a bit speedier than other opiates for me (never caught a nod off of oxy even IVing the old 80&#039;s). <br /><br />I know I might be asking for an apples and oranges comparison, but I wanted to know two things: what the rush is like from IVing opana and what is the duration of the high?&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to know an exact time, just if it is a short high or a longer high ... it will make a difference in what I choose to purchase.<br /><br />Thanks for you help folks!

				I have partaked in Hatter&#039;s opana elixer several times.&nbsp; It&#039;s a treat - a very expensive treat.&nbsp; Quick background on me:&nbsp; by the time August 2009 came I was on 180-240 mg oxycontin.&nbsp; Detoxed and had been pretty much opiate free until 2011.&nbsp; Due to ongoing pain issues, bought poppy pods to make tea.&nbsp; I make it every few days, one cup at a time.<br /><br />First tried Hatter&#039;s 5ml-5mg opana.&nbsp; Did really nothing so I went to his 5ml-25mg.&nbsp; Read up on his safety &amp; warnings (much appreciated, Hatter!) and took the plunge (bad pun).&nbsp; What I have discovered...<br />Due to my insane opiate thresh hold, it requires 2ml for a generous rush.&nbsp; I worked up from .5ml.&nbsp; The high does not last very long.&nbsp; I can easily go through 10ml (2 bottles) in about 5 hours with very little dopiness after affect.<br /><br />But this is the price we pay for IV usage.&nbsp; A bigger rush in the beginning but half the time it stays in the system.&nbsp; Which is why while in the hospital they will feed you narcotics on the hour.&nbsp; That is all about the time it will stay in your system before it drops off.<br /><br />So - when I buy Hatter&#039;s stuff, I buy it as a treat because each shot is costing me about 40-50 usd. At least that is what I figured it.<br /><br />Hatter does his best to keep costs down so don&#039;t bother asking for discount.&nbsp; I tried.&nbsp; His explanation was right on regarding process &amp; supplies.<br /><br />Because his stuff is popular, I suggest you 1) bookmark it as a favorite so you can check on it on a daily basis and 2) keep some BTCs to the side so when it does come up your ready to buy.<br /><br />If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.

				I don&#039;t care how rare oxymorphone is, I would N E V E R pay $50 for one fucking injection. Hatter&#039;s prices are RIDICULOUS and there is no way in hell he could ever justify them.

				oxymorphone gives a better rush than H for many people, one of the best<br /><br />and it shouldnt take that much if you dont have a serious tolerance. starter IV doses are like 1 mg<br /><br />it might be different for others but relatively i thought OM lasted a good bit longer than some things... especially like hydromorphone <br /><br />combines the rush and legs - like the king of all opioids that are available
