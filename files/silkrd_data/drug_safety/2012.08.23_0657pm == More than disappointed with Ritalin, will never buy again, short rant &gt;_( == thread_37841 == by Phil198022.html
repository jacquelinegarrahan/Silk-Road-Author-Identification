				To summarize my first and last experiment with Ritalin: I&#039;ve probably OD&#039;d on the Ritalin I received today in the mail, but still not much is happening. I took like 150 mg or so in the course of the afternoon and hardly feel a thing. What a waste of money, no hi, no euphoria, drinking 3 cups of coffee makes me happier than this and doesn&#039;t cost 100 bucks. No wonder it&#039;s not illegal. I wouldn&#039;t recommend anybody to waste their money on buying Ritalin. Maybe there are some bright sides I can&#039;t see. It does seem to work as an appetite suppressant, like all other stimulants I know do as well and that&#039;s more or less the only positive thing I can think of, in case you want to lose weight. But any street speed does that as well, is much cheaper at the same time and FUN.<br /><br />Maybe somebody else here can see something positive about this drug I missed. Oh yes, it can be snorted quite nicely as far as insufflating drugs goes, but with hardly any effect to speak of and actually I feel like an idiot for snorting about 60 mg of that stuff up my nose + taking about 100 mg orally. This isn&#039;t cocaine for the poor, because it&#039;s expensive and has no effect even remotely like cocaine. And all that work I spent to make those beautiful, perfect finely crushed lines for no effect to speak of, could just as well have spent an afternoon snorting flower. And I don&#039;t think I&#039;m some totally blunted regular meth user whose brain is too fried already to notice average stimulation. Good old ephedrine for example is a weak and inexpensive stimulant that I like because it keeps me awake, makes sports and other physical tasks easier etc., in case meth is too strong or dangerous or illegal for your taste. The last time I took any kind of amphetamine must have been more than 4 weeks ago, so I have no excessive tolerance. <br /><br />I really wish I HAD spent the money I spent on the Ritalin to buy some meth or amphetamine instead of this crap. For the same money I spent on these pills&nbsp; I could have gotten like a gram of meth or cocaine or 10 grams of speed instead (or who knows what else, depending on which drugs you like) and would be feeling like superman now instead of like going to bed. The only winner is Novartis, in having earned some money.<br /><br />Adderall, which the supplier kindly gave along as a sample was quite nice on the other hand, the way amphetamine is nice, if you like that feeling, but also far too expensive for what it does relative to illegal amphetamines.

				Thank you for your post.&nbsp; I was considering trying Ritalin and now I&#039;ll just stick with what I know works.<br /><br />I have read that Ritalin is a pro-drug, meaning it is metabolized into the psychoactive drug that is the stimulant.&nbsp; My understanding is that this reduces the rush as the medicine is released slowly, even when snorted.&nbsp; Can anyone verify this?

				The onset of effect should be fast - there is no metabolic delay involved, though it may take some time to absorb the drug into your system when taken orally as with most substances.<br /><br />Ritalin is a drug that does not have the same effect on everyone however. It&#039;s clinical use is often intended to achieve the opposite of the recreational effects, and only works in individuals sensitive to it. That is. it acts like a stimulant to most people, but more as a sedative for those suffering from ADHD. Since its a neuromodulator such contra-intuitive reactions are to be expected. <br /><br />If you are not sensitive to its effects, Ritalin may do nothing at all for you, or perhaps have an effect comparable to a few cups of coffee or a low dose tablet of ephedrine. If you are certain the tablets were legit, I&#039;d recommend not trying it again since the effects will most likely be equally disappointing.&nbsp;
