				So i did an old trick of heating up the bowl for ages with a jetty and then chucking like a tiny 10mg gram rock in it. Now usually this allows the rock to turn vapor almost instantly allowing for a big puff and hit in one breath, however this time i must have heated it up way to much (it was starting to glow a little) and the rock just hit the glass and preety much just popped and sent a beam of fire through the hole at the top of the pipe.<br />Anyone else experienced this? <br />Also thought this would be a great practical joke to play on a mate/girlfriend/your dad/police sergeant , assuming you have plenty of meth, probaly best done at the start of the night/session aswell as i could imagine this could lead to some stabbings (or shootings for you US brahs)<br /><br />always innovating<br /><br />BC

It wasnt overly dangerous just enough to give someone a shock, havent you ever packed your mates bong with sparkler dust for a laugh?<br />i don&#039;t see the difference between placing and dropping? either way its probably hit a way temperature for the molecule&nbsp; way to fast leading to in spontasous combustion. Like i said though, if meths gettin scarce, probably shouldn&#039;t do this, someone could get really really angry<br />BC

				Dropping a rock into a pipe as compared to setting it down gently could make a large difference at a high temperature, this should be common knowledge...

				hahah thats cool, might try that myself. <br /><br />I think im trying to take massive puffs cos they feel better but I end up burning it, any ideas how to prevent this? only way i can think of is to take away the heat sooner but it doesnt give a big enough hit.<br /><br />Sparkler dust in a bong hit LOL shit would be funny as! as long as no one got hurt of course.

				Just like ice turns into water, then turns into steam when heat is applied- so as it does with Meth.&nbsp; Solid-&gt;liquid-&gt;gas. so youre not really&nbsp; smoking it, youre inhaling it in it&#039;s gaseous form.<br />Take your time A long slow draw at a lower heat will get you off considerably more than the way youre doing it. Hell im surprised you havent sucked down a superheated puddle into your throat like that.

And in the case of combustible materials, auto-ignition is also possible. Water goes from solid to liquid to gas, but other things like to skip stages.
