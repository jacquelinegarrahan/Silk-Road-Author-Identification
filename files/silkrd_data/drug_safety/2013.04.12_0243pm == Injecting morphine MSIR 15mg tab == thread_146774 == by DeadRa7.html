				I&#039;ll make this brief, but would appreciate any honest feedback on this topic.&nbsp; I am an occasional IV heroin user and have been for a few years (I&#039;ll indulge at the most twice a month, I enjoy the high but not enough to do it any more than stated above)&nbsp; I recently acquired some 15MG Morphine Sulfate pills from Pharmmaid, and have one left.&nbsp; I ate the other 4 and barely felt shit, including breaking one in half and attempted to cook it using the same method of dope (break it down into a spoon, cook it up, filter it and bang it).&nbsp; When I did this with the MSIR, it just turned into this goopy shit and when I injected it, not much happened (it couldn&#039;t be sucked up into the rig).&nbsp; Obviously I did something wrong.&nbsp; Google searches just came up with threads on the clearnet of idiots bashing anyone asking the above question, so it was little help.&nbsp; I would really not like to waste this last pill as they were quite expensive.&nbsp; So I figured I&#039;d ask on here-what is the proper way to IV this shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve got a small amount of coin left in my wallet, and will send it over to anyone who can properly answer the above question for me.&nbsp; I am a pretty experienced drug user, but at am a loss on this one.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />in;b4 you shouldn&#039;t be IV&#039;ing any drug<br /><br />Thank you SR community.&nbsp; I hope you can help me out with this one

				a pill has&nbsp; shit in it to keep it together.&nbsp; that&#039;s why it turned to black goo. not morphine only. <br />&nbsp;really not a good idea to shoot these!<br />about the effects:<br />&nbsp;i got no idea. maybe you wont get high on them because of your H tolerance. Junkies often report that Morphine has no effect!<br />also i think morphine is not a &quot;rush&quot; drug. <br />the only thing you could try is maybe break it up and plug it. but its not gonna be stronger than 4 swallowed pills.....

				The problem is simple bro.&nbsp; A lot of vendors are selling morphine extended release as IRs to get them to sell.&nbsp; Morphine XRs aren&#039;t popular because compared to hydrocodone and oxycodone they absolutely suck when taken orally.&nbsp; And obviously because of the fact that like the problem you had your self.&nbsp; Morphine sulfate are all time released from what I know and they gel up when you mix it up with water.<br /><br />Hope I helped.
