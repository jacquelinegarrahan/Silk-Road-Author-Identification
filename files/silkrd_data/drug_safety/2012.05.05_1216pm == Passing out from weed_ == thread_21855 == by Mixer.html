				Yesterday I got some Kali Mist and of course I wanted to finally give a try to a Sativa. I don&#039;t smoke frequently (last time had been two weeks ago) so I don&#039;t have tolerance and I usually smoke shitty weed...<br />I loaded 0.1g in my mini pipe and took 5 small hits, holding them in, because I wasn&#039;t feeling much. I smoked about half of what I had put in the pipe. After 5 minutes I realize it&#039;s coming up slooooowly. Another 5 minutes, and I start tripping (I had never tripped on weed). OMG weed CEVs are fantastic :D And I got good OEVs as well.<br />I was sitting and I start to feel lightheaded and I realize I was fainting... I laid on the floor and put my legs on a chair to get more blood to the brain, and I fought for some minutes to not pass out. I ended up staying on the floor for 3 HOURS before I could get up without fainting. Two or three times I almost passed out while I was lying! I thought it could be low blood sugar or low blood pressure, so I told my friend to measure them (around T+2:00). My blood sugar was 120 mg/dL (it&#039;s fine, I&#039;m diabetic), my pressure was 150/87 mmHg and my beat rate was 120bpm! Still I felt like I was fainting from a low blood pressure. When I got up I was at 120/66 87bpm. I don&#039;t think it was a panic attack or something like that because I was happy and laughing at things (except when I was fighting against passing out). Today I still feel a bit lightheaded and I&#039;m really tired. I just measured my BP and it is 109/61 75bpm (both BP and BR are a bit low for me).<br />Before smoking the weed I had exercised for an hour (breakdance) and I was on an empty stomach.<br /><br />Have I just smoked too much? Has it ever happened to you? I was thinking of giving it another try this night, taking only a hit every 10-15 minutes until I am satisfied. Would you advise against it?<br /><br />Thanks :)

(Smoke a lot)<br /><br />Make sure you are full before the joint I think this helps, ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS have a drink with a joint I always drink loads of drinks I will have a drink before smoking, while smoking then another after, its better.<br /><br />Hope this helps, and also always eat during stoned.

I&#039;m freaking jealous, I would conserve so much bud if I were that sensitive. I can smoke close to an eighth in an hour and it still won&#039;t &#039;t make a difference, I&#039;ll only be as high as I get from smoking half a gram. I have to eat a few potent edibles to get to where you&#039;re at. :D

				I used to smoke regularly but stopped because once I tried some other things I lost interest in it, now every time I smoke I get really dizzy, collapse onto the floor and can&#039;t move for a good 5 minutes. When I regain function I have a horrible headache for the rest of the day and an extremely unpleasant high

				I&#039;ve had that happen to me before, where I passed out from smoking too much, but I also vomited and then slept for almost 14 hours. One of my friends claimed that he laced it, but I can&#039;t tell if he&#039;s just fucking with me or what, because he won&#039;t tell me what he claims to have put in it and I have no idea where he would get anything to lace it with. He also smoked it with me and didn&#039;t have any bad reaction.

				I took one hit and waited 15 minutes, then I took another and now it has been 15 minutes since the last hit. I found out that it takes 10 minutes to come up fully, while the weed I usually smoke only takes 5 minutes (I think this accounted for yesterday disaster). Also, during the comeup I feel my blood pressure drop, but it doesn&#039;t bother me after. Feeling good :) sativa feels soooo much better than the hybrid I&#039;m used to.

				What strain was the weed? Did you buy it on SR?<br />Just curious because I&#039;ve only ever smoked shitty street weed and some hybrid (chronic) which i got from SR, and I really wanted to try Sativa because it sounds like my kinda experience so I ordered some Jack Herer and can&#039;t wait for it to arrive :D

				Yes, I will often fall asleep while smoking, although pretty heavily. That usually consists of me and a couple buddies sitting around for a couple hours smoking out of a vape and bong. Indicas will knock your ass out if you get good stuff, and that&#039;s what I get from SR. :)<br /><br />Sativas are my favorite, because of the up feeling, but sometimes you just want that nod.
