				Hopefully that got your attention. Up until now, I hadn&#039;t touched any substance in almost a year. I&#039;ve taken MDMA about 12-15 times over the course of a three year period, and never really abused it (only one cap a night, well space rolls).<br /><br />Ordered 2.5g of Cloudsurfer&#039;s MDMA some months ago. Upon receiving it, I weighed out a dose and booster for myself, my girlfriend and a friend. My friend and I had 100mg caps with a 40mg booster and my girlfriend had 90mg with a 30mg booster. On a nearly empty stomach and after taking some precautionary vitamins, we took the caps and after an hour we were feeling next to nothing. Based on some of the reviews of CS&#039;s MDMA, I was certainly expecting more.<br /><br />After that hour, we all took our boosters. 20-30 minutes after taking the booster (140mg total), I began to feel slightly stronger effects and had the slightest rolling sensation, but nothing compared to the rush of euphoria that I&#039;ve experienced in the past. My girlfriend and friend reported the same. I was pretty much back to baseline after 2-3 hours.<br /><br />I&#039;m the heaviest of the three at just over 80kg. I see people on this forum reporting a much more intense experience after taking 100mg, even from Cloudsurfer. So what&#039;s the deal here? I&#039;ll admit, that night I was probably a bit tense as I&#039;ve never went through the process of ordering, weighing, capping and consuming MDMA before, but my girlfriend and friend wouldn&#039;t have had any of those considerations and they felt the same. Did all three of us just not consume enough?<br /><br />I&#039;d appreciate any input. Planning on taking more after Christmas and would like to have a better time!

				that&#039;s odd cuz i&#039;ve heard that cloudsurfer&#039;s is quite euphoric...<br /><br />then again i&#039;ve also heard that very clean pure MDMA or certain isomers of it usually has more empathic effects than physical euphoria...like more of a theraputic emotional bonding effect...<br /><br />perhaps you should try a strong attack dose on the order of 150 - 180mg...<br /><br />btw what is your body weight, when was the last time you rolled, do you preload, and are you on any medications?

				Maybe you should try dutch (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/8cfa29972d), his MDMA always made feel being on top of the world. His packaging is badass aswell, so it should arrive for sure.<br />Anyways, better dose a bit more in the beginning and do less redosing, its less neurotoxic and it gives you a better peak. I never redose for myself, there is no reason to prolong the good feeling, enjoy it while it lasts but let it go when it leaves.

				I&#039;m 180 pounds (about 80kg), eat relatively healthy and hit the gym every other day. Both people I took it with weigh less; girlfriend about 130 and friend is probably like 160. All well-spaced rolls and never abused MDMA. None of us take any other drugs and would usually have at most one alcoholic drink when taking MDMA. None of us are on any medication. Before taking the MDMA we had Vitamin C throughout the day, ALA, Vitamin E, magnesium. No 5-HTP beforehand. Last time my girlfriend and I rolled was NYE of last year, so it was 10+ months between rolls. Can&#039;t speak to my friend&#039;s last roll.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of doing at this point is taking a larger dose and just popping 160mg and leaving it at that. I&#039;m honestly not one to redose but others had already suggested that I start small with CS MDMA and then boost is up if need be just to see where I stand.<br /><br />The pills said friend used to obtain pre-2010 would provide an absolutely awesome roll with all the typical effects. They were caps and would hit hard and fast and wear in about 2-3 hours. I&#039;m just trying to duplicate those experiences. Truth is, we had no idea what was in them, but we never really experienced any ill side effects.<br /><br />What I will say with regards to CS MDMA is that my girlfriend usually has a tough time coming down but coming down on CS MDMA wasn&#039;t a problem for any of us. Sometimes it can be a little rough for the 2-3 days following but that really wasn&#039;t much of an issue with Cloudsurfer.

				Try that 160mg dose and take an antacid like Rolaids or Tums beforehand. Antacids seem to increase bioavailability of amphetamines and phenethylamines....

				What you&#039;re used to probably wasn&#039;t pure MDMA then. I&#039;ve been buying MDMA from SR for awhile now and Cloudsurfers has definitely been up there with the best I&#039;d say.&nbsp; Although, people exaggerate MDMA quality on this site so don&#039;t fall into the hype. If you&#039;re buying from someone who has good crystal it&#039;s going to be basically identical to someone else who is selling good crystal.<br />But still, without a doubt, Cloudsurfer is at least known to have the best product right now.<br /><br />I&#039;m 180 lbs and I&#039;m used to taking 200mg initial doses for concerts and when I did it again (took maybe 220mg) with Cloudsurfers product a few weeks ago I blacked out a good amount of the show I was at since I was rolling so hard. I totally underestimated the potency of this molly. I&#039;d say don&#039;t go so weak on the doses next time and start off with at least 140mg.

				Hi blamehoffman,<br />Maybe you had Methylone (bk-MDMA) instead of MDMA. I heard this substance have a similar effect like MDMA.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylone

				To the OP, i know what you mean, i too had a similar ecperiance but not with CS but with another vendor.<br /><br />i had 130mg and made a 70mg booster, it did absolutely fuck all, got a little tingly but nothing major. the vendor i got it off has a good rep for his MDMA so i put it down to me not reacting to it, i decided&nbsp; to give a friend 130mg to try thinking it was just me but me had the same affect. i didnt say anything to the vendor as i dont want to complain when everyone else is getting the goods, i just decided to try another vendor.<br /><br />i just bombed 170mg now to see if it does anything, im hoping it puts me on my arse but im not holding my breath.<br />ive had no problems with my vendor before and dont want to complain to him incase he thinks im having a whinge which im not.<br /><br />if the 170mg does nothing would anyone recommend trying 200mg? <br />i&#039;ve been taking drugs for about 25 years and i MDMA started around early to mid 90&#039;s mostly in pill form.<br />my question is would pills hit harder than pure md? im quessing yes ad it can have other subs in it that can work with the MDMA.<br />i was hoping to get the teeth flapping and eye wobbles like the good pills a few years ago.<br />&nbsp;

				Hello hoffman,<br /><br />I just did CS&#039;s MDMA over the weekend - it was brilliant! I&#039;m around your weight too, and did a 175mg capsule + 100 mg booster over the course of a few hours. Amazing! Clean (though anxious) come up, then fucking party for the next 4 hours. It&#039;s possible 140mg doesn&#039;t feel quite right compared to pills because the pills were cut with something? This is a recent batch of CS too, about last month perhaps.<br /><br />Try it again next time with a bigger dose. I had a couple of friends all rolling nuts on the stuff.

I&#039;m not knocking his product at all. It was clean and I experienced no ill side effects.<br /><br />And coolkid321, for the record, I never said Cloudsurfer owed me anything, and I made that clear in my modified post in his thread. I don&#039;t know where you got the impression that I thought I was owed something.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing wrong with this thread. Everyone reacts to MDMA differently. I&#039;m a light MDMA user who is merely looking for feedback after an experience with Cloudsurfer&#039;s MDMA. Had I left Cloudsurfer&#039;s name out of his, I wouldn&#039;t be flamed at all, but because CS took it the wrong way, now I&#039;m being shit on?
