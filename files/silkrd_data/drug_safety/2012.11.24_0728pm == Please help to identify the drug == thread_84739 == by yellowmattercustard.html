				Hi. My dealer has sold me that stuff. I have not tried it yet, and I am curious what is it. By description it is:<br />- very much like MDMA, but not MDMA,<br />- a little bit like meth, but not too much, gives a little speedy effect,<br />- best drug for sex he has ever tried, and he tried many,<br />- white crystals, looks like salt, very much like MSG, not like MDMA.<br />- street name is Miu.<br /><br />Any ideas, gentlemen?

				did it have a smell? did he tell you how long it would last? either i would say its close to 90% possible its a cathinone. maybe an apb if you are extremely lucky haha. i wouldnt buy something if i couldnt recognize it by eye and my dealer told me it was &quot;like&quot; what i want to be taking.

MDPV is kind of speedy, and I&#039;ve heard quite a few anecdotal reports of it being a great drug for sex. However the PV I&#039;ve got looks more like powdered sugar than anything salty. <br /><br />You don&#039;t happen to have a Marquis reagent test handy, do you?

				lol thats why i asked if it had a smell. mdpv smells like jizz, literally. but it takes such a small amount for a dose that i couldnt picture someone saying its like mdma. its okay for sex but its the most fiendish drug i have ever ingested for sure. nbomes are the best ive ever had where sex is concerned 8)

				Sounds like mephedrone to me. It feels a bit like MDMA meets cocaine. It is my fav drugs for cuddling, kissing and having sex.

				Meph. MDPV would cause serious health problems at MDMA doses so describing it as &quot;like MDMA&quot; would make him a dangerous idiot.

				Yeah, look like it is mephedrone. Because also the dealer was trying to remember drug&#039;s chemical name and claimed it was something like &#039;mephedrine&#039;. So I guess it is mephedrone.<br /><br />Thanks to you all, guys!

				see the thing I noticed with most IRL dealers is that they are really shady and are out for a quick buck.&nbsp; Since finding SR a year ago I don&#039;t really rely on this place, But It&#039;ll work for now. SR is my connect lol.
