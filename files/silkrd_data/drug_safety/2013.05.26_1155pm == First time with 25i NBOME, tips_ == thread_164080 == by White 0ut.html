				Hey guys, just got my x100 tab sheet from righteous....<br /><br />I have never done any RC&#039;s before so I am a little hesitant.<br /><br />They are all Hcl 1000ug 25i NBOME Blotters.<br /><br />I just want to test the waters this first go around, nothing too crazy.<br /><br />Can someone recommend how many to take and the safest possible method, I have read stories of people dying on RC&#039;s but I have also seen people swear by them on here.<br /><br />Any advice is appreciated!

				Stay well hydrated before and during the trip. Also, pay mind to your body temperature; if you&#039;re getting warm don&#039;t be afraid to take a cold shower.<br /><br />IDK if you&#039;re experienced with other psychedelics. If not you may want to start with just half a tab, it will still pack quite a punch at only a half dose.<br /><br />And put on some good music and have fun!

				These NBOMe overdoses seem to be happening via nasal administration, whether dissolved (poor dilation?) or in powder form (people not realizing this is dosed in micrograms). With tabs, you should be safe, especially if you&#039;re not taking a bunch. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of a single hospitalization from buccal administration. I&#039;ve ordered and taken Righteous&#039;s tabs, and I think half a tab is definitely enough. One tab for me makes for a pretty strong trip. I&#039;ve also done it alone, and that was just fine.<br /><br />There&#039;s powder on your tabs? That&#039;s really strange, maybe concerning. My Righteous tabs were clean.<br /><br />25i-NBOMe will last up until 6-12 hours after you take it, depending on your dose and what point you consider your return to sobriety to begin.

				How&#039;d ya do @White out?<br />Last time i dropped 25-i was a few weeks ago with my girl and we only had one tyler tab (~800ug) each she said she coulda had 2 or even 3 i was perfectly fine with one and i trip way more than her, so tolerance can be weird with RC&#039;s i guess.<br /><br />and good man, selling them as 25-i not acid, although when i do the same i always compare it to being similar to acid and go soo far as to say someone who has never tripped on acid will not know the difference, but what are street prices for tabs goin for?? i try and get 10/tab but settle as low as 5.<br /><br />dont forget to update on your trip report i love hearing from first timers and you picked a good RC to try first.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s weird...well, maybe a little. ;)&nbsp; I enjoy doing lots of psychedelics by myself.<br /><br />1 tab (maybe even 2) and you&#039;ll be just fine. Start going above that by yourself, and get ready to go on a very intense psychedelic trip, quite different from an intense trip on a more traditional psychedelic. Be prepared for some very real/intense hallucinations, as in actually seeing shit that&#039;s not there. And, mentally, a world of fractal/recursive/infinite thought processes. You may also lose your sense of consequences; I&#039;d recommend making sure beforehand that your place is clean and well organized and that both valuable and potentially dangerous objects are put away.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a a trip report I wrote a while when I did 6 tabs with no tolerance:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36654.msg728108#msg728108<br /><br />Also, there was an awesome user around here a while ago by the name of &quot;typtap&quot; who experimented with even larger doses of 25i/NBOMe&#039;s. If you search his name you&#039;ll find lots more interesting info/experiences on them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164080.msg1173976#msg1173976">Quote from: jackofspades on May 29, 2013, 05:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How&#039;d ya do @White out?<br />Last time i dropped 25-i was a few weeks ago with my girl and we only had one tyler tab (~800ug) each she said she coulda had 2 or even 3 i was perfectly fine with one and i trip way more than her, so tolerance can be weird with RC&#039;s i guess.<br /><br />and good man, selling them as 25-i not acid, although when i do the same i always compare it to being similar to acid and go soo far as to say someone who has never tripped on acid will not know the difference, but what are street prices for tabs goin for?? i try and get 10/tab but settle as low as 5.<br /><br />dont forget to update on your trip report i love hearing from first timers and you picked a good RC to try first.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d also like to know what street/festival prices are for single tabs.

Many people re-dose thinking they are not feeling powerful enough effects only to find out the full blow hitting just a little after they have re-dosed (and many times, depending on the invididual, this is enough for them to start panicking, especially with RC in where there has been reports of OD). <br /><br />One thing you don&#039;t want with psychedelics in general but even more with NBOMEs is to go where you didn&#039;t plan to in the beginning just for your impatience. This can turn a wonderful experience in a nightmare soon enough, especially if you are not accustomed to the effects of the substance from previous trips.<br /><br />A thing I always say concerning psychedelics is that there&#039;s no hurry and nothing to prove to yourself or others. These substances are to be taken with calm, courage, responsibility and sacredness. Hurrying up or wanting to play bravado serves nothing but to harm yourself in the process. <br /><br />Approach the experience (in its totality) in a sacred way and you will have a sacred outcome; approach the experience with the intention of killing time and it will be much more probable that time will kill yourself.
