				Hello, I&#039;ve experimented with drugs in the past. Coke made my head and chest hurt, on more than one occasion; Meth, I&#039;ve tried once, never again, I tried once with a buddy and just about had a mental breakdown. I do enjoy various pills, but I&#039;ve never had the urge to keep doing it when I couldn&#039;t get a hold of them.<br /><br />I always find myself perfectly happy with a baggy of pot. Other than reduced sperm count, what other problems can weekly marijuana usage do to me? I feel like I&#039;ve been brainwashed by years of Above the Influence commercials. <br /><br />Edit: I usually only have time to smoke on the weekends, and I only vaporize. I guess my question is, is THC detrimental to my body, the way I use it?

				&nbsp;vaporizing is the best way to take it so&nbsp; keep on truckin..<br /><br />It causes mental illness in people who don&#039;t use it!&nbsp; You know that moment when your mother finds out your smoking weed instead of school? That is pure psychosis!

				well for me, marijuana definitely covers up my depression, but when i start taking it every day, my depression gets worse and i become almost painfully lazy.....which only adds to the depression. but every now and then when the depression or stress becomes unbearable, marijuana is a wonderful. it&#039;s just if i do it every day it makes it worse.

				anyway it&#039;s GOOD that you are content with just marijuana. cocaine and meth have destroyed many people. yes marijuana has its risks, as i mentioned, but it&#039;s better to eb addicted to marijuana than meth<br /><br />have you tried any psychedelics?

				Have you tired Psychedelics?<br /><br />I&#039;m actually too afraid to. After my last stint with meth, I don&#039;t have the urge to try anything else I&#039;m unfamiliar with. Also, I know exactly the feel you mean if you smoke it habitually, then stop suddenly, our&nbsp; depression gets worse for a bit. After a while, I start to feel normal, but I refuse to take any more chemical drugs for my depression. I don&#039;t like the way they make me feel. Whats the point of getting rid of depression when if feels like my whole being is being torn apart.

(literally)<br />there is no &quot;actual&quot; reality because each and every man has a different mind and a different set of views that changes the way the world appears to them.<br /><br />my first blast off, i was taken to a city made entirely of these pink ,gel-like, pyramid like objects that were maybe 2 inches wide/long.<br />the city was huge. big skyscrapers and buildings made entirely of this material.<br />can you guess what else was made of those pyramids? ME<br />it showed me my connection to the earth and everything around me.<br />all is one and we should treat it as such.<br />we are all god, experiencing ourselves subjectively.<br />we are ALL part of the collective unconscious/mother earth.<br /><br />the pyramid like objects fit into eachother like puzzle pieces which led me to an analogy i came up with after the experience.<br /><br />imagine the entire world as a puzzle, and picture yourself as one piece. same with everyone else.<br />we are all equal, we are all just a miniscule part of the BIG picture, but WE get to decide what our piece looks like.<br />we get to decide how we contribute to the &quot;whole&quot;<br /><br />ill stop talking about my wild dmt escapades, but let me just say.<br />your perception plays into everything. if you go into knowing you will learn something, you will learn something.<br /><br />having a spiritual backround helps though, no doubt.<br />maybe thats whats missing? <br />=3<br /><br /><br />

				Why exactly does this drug have such a bad stigma? I mean, it&#039;s really popular and all, even the point where most teenagers will use it often, but not go to harder drugs, and most drug users consider it a second-sober, but why does half the population of the US hate it? Why is there such a prevalent anti-marijuana campaign? I mean, with something like meth or heroin or almost every hard drug, addiction is a very serious problem that costs the nation, and they&#039;re so fucking dangerous, that it&#039;s very easy to see why they would be outlawed and hated by most. But it&#039;s not like there&#039;s ever been a huge epidemic of marijuana death and addiction. <br /><br />I suppose the laws and anti-marijuana campaigns are a carry-over from the attempts to suppress the hippie cultural revolution. BUT THAT WAS FORTY FUCKING YEARS AGO! All these anti-drug campaigns have any easy-to-do job considering everything they have to work with when getting you to hate hard drugs, but when it comes to cannabis, they just beat around the bush and just tell you it&#039;s bad without ever saying why. All the reasons they do give(which are very few) are easily debunked. But nobody has any reason to hate cannabis. My parents always told me that they would hope I never smoked, yet they were frequent users of cannabis and never had any reason to tell me why it&#039;s was bad.&nbsp; Even if it lowers ambitions, that wouldn&#039;t make a difference if you&#039;re not going to be spending that time doing something productive anyways. <br /><br /><br />So TL;DR/summary version: Why do people hate marijuana and want to discourage other from using it, considering it&#039;s lack of negative effects.

But extrasensory information, while scientifically interesting and worth exploring, is, assuming it&#039;s real, intermediate between the physical and spiritual realms of existence. God is not information. He cannot be reduced to anything other than God. I find that LSD and mushrooms can put me into a purely spiritual state....a state that cannot be reduced to information, intellection, language, ideas, etc., because it is higher than these things. Call it satori, samadhi, union with god, whatever you want... i&#039;ve experienced it on acid and on mushrooms.... and 99% of people who take acid these don&#039;t take enough to reach this state because the standard dosage is so low and the acid is of inferior quality<br /><br />actually, to move back on topic, the best spiritual drug is probably MARIJUANA, and not any of the psychedelics...

				I&#039;ve been smoking weed for years and I have a successful life overall I&#039;d say, it has not had nearly as dramatic effect on my day to day life like stimulants have, coke, meth, these are some seriously evil drugs.&nbsp; As much as I love weed though I usually crave different kinds of highs depending on my mood.<br /><br />As far as long term things to worry about though?&nbsp; Your memory might space out a little, but its temporary and abstaining for a short time will return you to tip top shape.&nbsp; For the most part though my weed use doesn&#039;t impair my ability to work or enjoy life.&nbsp; It affects everyone differently though so YMMV, but for the most part weed is probably amongst the safest drugs on your body physiologically.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure DMT is about the same safety profile besides the harsher smoke possibly being a mild hazard.

				If you know how to use the holy herb she can literally save lives you must first understand cannabis ie... the difference between sativa/ indica and every thing in between.<br /><br />Then you must learn how your mind works this will allow you to enjoy being stoned a lot more.<br /><br />The whole paranoia thing is totally over the top you see if a plant is not grown correctly and you smoke it when the effects hit its like the plants way of telling you something is not right for not growing her right for not flushing fully for not drying and curing correctly but if all of these things are done to the highest quality and you understand the strain you smoke there will be no paranoia however people often confuse the awakening cannabis offers with paranoia as it allows you to see the mistakes you once missed then once see all the mistakes your making in your life so very clearly all of a sudden combined with the effects of being stoned some people freak out but this can be over come if you know how basically just start to live your life in a better and honest way then try to smoke the herb again you will see the effects become better and better in time.<br />If you know how cannabis will undoubtedly make you become a better person if you just abuse her and smoke any old rubbish combined with alcohol and drugs well this is where problems may occur but nothing major compared to real drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />oh and the whole sperm count thing all lies dont believe anything you read about cannabis 99.9 percent of the time its lies there are no actual real studies to prove cannabis use even in heavy users effects sperm count I mean I have 5 children and I have been smoking 20+ years so its clearly not effecting me and my friends are all the same they have kids they smoke regular.<br /><br />Many people abuse drink and drugs then find their way to cannabis but by then its usually to late they are a mess so when people find out they use cannabis regular guess what cannabis gets the blame but you have done the right thing you have worked out that all you need is cannabis and drugs are not for you this is what the majority of people would think if it was not for a mixture the black market/media lies/bad weed and all the confusing messages that comes with it many young people think oh I have smoked cannabis the damage is already done lets do other drugs when in reality cannabis has caused no damage.<br /><br />Cannabis has a wide variety of use&#039;s all of which are positive but humans will be humans and we will abuse something that feels so good my advice is keep doing what your doing stay clear of drink and drugs and just use cannabis you will lead a much healthier and happier life mind body and soul, dont listen to some of the haters posting negative things about cannabis chances are they just cant handle their weed.<br /><br /><br />

				Perhaps its not something you should obsess about at all. <br /><br />I reckon that smoking a joint could be as dangerous as smoking a normal cigarette when it comes to cancer risks. It could be a bit less or a bit more, but just in the same order of risk. <br /><br />Most people that smoke cigarettes smoke about 30 of them every single day. Compared to the average number of joints smoked by the non-tobacco smoking pothead, that is quite a lot more. <br /><br />Most cannabis users don&#039;t smoke more then a few joints a day, perhaps 1/10th the number of cigarettes smoked by most smokers. There would probably be a small increase in the chance of lung cancer. The question to ask if this increased risk is worth it. Compared to drinking alcohol i suppose its actually tiny, and you&#039;d be safer as a pothead than as a regular boozer.
