				So I experimented a bit with Dr. Gonzo&#039;s Methylone at a recent festival.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t use an exact scale but dosed twice at around ~160 mgs over the course of 3 days.&nbsp; I have to say it was probably the most fun I have ever had.&nbsp; I was also tripping during the first roll but only took methylone on the last day.&nbsp; Anyways, I am pretty sure I have never taken any pure MDMA and don&#039;t plan on using any yet since why not save the holy grail for when Methylone loses its magic.<br /><br />I got a few questions though... how do people feel about 5/6 APB vs. Methylone?&nbsp; Are there different safety concerns between these products?&nbsp; I am currently under the impression that methylone can be used a bit more often than MDMA because it doesnt rape Serotin as hard.&nbsp; I don&#039;t plan on taking methylone alot anyways but am just looking for more info etc....&nbsp; If i were to go out to a party I was thinking of microdosing methylone just to really be super sociable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts/Info would be great!&nbsp; Thanks :)&nbsp;

				Comparing 6-APB with Methylone is like comparing a BMW with a Volvo. <br /><br />(Volvo is safer and lame,&nbsp; while the BMW is much much more intense but you need to be more careful with it because you might fly off a serotonin cliff :D)

				In the Grand Wizard&#039;s experience, good methylone is far more enjoyable than a shitty &quot;E&quot; pill.&nbsp; (I.e: the shit which flooded the East Coast at the beginning of the 21st century and has stayed around since... ).&nbsp; Given the garbage which has passed for &quot;E&quot; lo these many years, I&#039;m not at all surprised that you had a better experience with M1 than your comrades had with their &quot;real Ecstasy.&quot;&nbsp; That being said, even the best methylone roll can&#039;t hold a candle to a good dose of real, clean MDMA.&nbsp; Methylone is more subtle and mellow than MDMA: it&#039;s definitely empathogenic but it&#039;s not quite that &quot;DJ and light systems provided by GOD&quot; sense of amazement and good feeling.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got no experience with 5/6-APB. Because both compounds are relatively difficult to synthesize, I know that a lot of bogus &quot;5-APB/6-APB&quot; has been sold. So I&#039;d say if you wanted to try an x-APB do some research on the buyer and make sure you&#039;re not getting something Eric swept off his floor and threw into a bag for export.&nbsp; I&#039;ve generally heard good things about real APB compounds, but I&#039;ve also heard horror stories about people who wound up taking an MDPV/faux-mephedrone cocktail and staying up for three days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly, if I were you I might just get some good Molly from a good SR vendor rather than looking for good 5/6-APB.&nbsp; Even the best reports I&#039;ve heard about 5/6-APB say it&#039;s &quot;almost as good as MDMA.&quot;&nbsp; So why not just skip that and go with the real thing?<br />&nbsp;

				My input as I have had all 3. This is just my opinion so forgive all the &quot;I&#039;s&quot;.<br /><br />I love methylone for what it is. I think it&#039;s one of the best chemicals to come around, I hate mephedrone.<br />I think methylone is the best because it has a shorter duration than mdma but with very similar effects. I can have a quick-roll or a micro dose for sociability and not be wide-eyed for 6 hours.<br /><br />I think if you&#039;re going to be out all night, mdma is probably the better one of the 2.<br /><br />Now, as for 6-apb, I have some of this on hand. It&#039;s relatively cheap, I have reagent tested it because of all the fake stuff that went out in 2010/11. This is legit stuff though. The only thing I don&#039;t like about it, it doesn&#039;t micro dose well.<br />I take 40-50mg of methylone, I can have a nice energy boost, a nice lil euphoria, sociability and empathy, 90 minutes later it&#039;s gone.<br />I take 40-50mg of mdma, I can have an energy lift, grind my teeth slightly, placebo euphoria and become a little talkative. But I can feel residual effects for a few hours.<br />I take 40mg of 6-apb, I can feel a slightly elevated mood, possibly placebo. I don&#039;t get anything else but diarrhea for 4 days.<br /><br />All of the above chemicals cause me to get diarrhea, even in small doses. I am sensitive to stimulants but I also take a lot of pills regularly for health reasons so I may have ulcers or something.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a micro-dose spot for 6-apb but if 100mg is a full dose and 40-50 doesn&#039;t do much, it would seem methylone or mdma would be more cost effective. 6-apb is said to be closer to mda anyway so it&#039;s slightly more trippy.<br /><br />A direct friend of mine took 210-220mg 6-apb after drinking all night and taking a &quot;party pill&quot; earlier that night (contents were likely butylone or similar &#039;legal high&#039; from the usa).<br />He has no experience with psychedelics at all other than this. That is a larger dose but he handled it very well. He fell in love with 6-apb. He said he was tingling all over and getting &quot;rushes of good energy and chills&quot; and most importantly &quot;I am having a hard time using my phone, because I feel like I am in a 3d movie and my phone feels far away from my fingers!!&quot;<br /><br /><br />When I was younger, mdma wouldn&#039;t cause me diarrhea or upset stomach for more than 24 hours. Now I&#039;m a little older and my diet + medicine intake is worse, it lasts 4-5 days after. <br /><br />I am still on the fence for doing a large dose of 6-apb just for the reason of diarrhea. If I wanna shit for days, I&#039;d go with mdma.<br />

				for me, 6-APB is to MDA<br />as Methylone is to MDMA<br /><br />haven&#039;t tried 5-APB. 6-APB felt more poisonous to my body than M1. M1&#039;s re-dose abilities make it easier to abuse. I think it mixes quite well with MDMA, like a kick start.<br /><br />some Caffeine might be a nice mix.<br /><br />anyone else drink a red-bull while peaking?

				i too have done a decent amount in a night, a few nights in a row... problem is, it&#039;s hard to reach that eurphoric state sometimes on a binge and that makes you want to do more and more. the next day your jaw and maybe your head let you know you fucked up.<br /><br />i like to use it to bump up a roll sometimes but don&#039;t try and be a hero, i can&#039;t say a binge has really been beneficial.

				Im not super interested in stimulants in general (way more interested in psychs).&nbsp; I dont exactly remember what caused me to not want to try it but I think it was a combination of some erowid trip reports and such...&nbsp; im sure at some point I will try it but as of now it doesnt really fit anywhere in my life.&nbsp; If i want to party, ill drink or microdose methylone.&nbsp; If i want to chill with friends or learn about myself ill mess with DMT/Nbomes etc...&nbsp;
