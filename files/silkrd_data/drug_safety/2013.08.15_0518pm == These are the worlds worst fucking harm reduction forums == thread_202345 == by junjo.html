				Just pointing out that most of the advice here spewed by these imbeciles will get you killed, while posting helpful stories about harm reduction get you mocked and admonished by the mods themselves. Please, for your own fucking safety, go to bluelight.ru and ignore these forums if you&#039;re a newbie. This is my last fucking post on this shit forum. I hope all you assholes OD and get what&#039;s coming to you, fucking pricks.

				I think most of the the &quot;will get you killed&quot; advice is obvious sarcasm.<br />Many SR veterans would likely think, if you are here you should already know what you want, how much you want, and how to do it.<br />Really I don&#039;t see a point to having 30 different places for the same info.&nbsp; Erowid is where most people go for info, trip reports, dosage recommendations and cross-drug interactions.<br />To rely on a mere message board is not too bright, because it&#039;s mostly heresay.<br />Erowid at least researches most of the info they put on there, and they warn that trip reports may or may not actually feature the substances the users thought they were taking.<br />The format of Erowid is also more conducive to finding and sharing drug information, where a message board is not.

				Junjo I hope you are realizing that by starting all of these threads you are feeding the troll.&nbsp; Getting you upset is what trolls live for.<br /><br />On another note, Erowid has some of the most out of date, antiquated, non reviewed information out there.&nbsp; So many inaccuracies and falsehoods that are never corrected.<br /><br />Bluelight is a much better source for current info.

				Well I lied, I&#039;m back, but just to explain why I&#039;m so mad.<br />Basically<br />-I make a thread warning people about dangerous side effects i experienced from a one time methylone use, with the goal of keeping other people safe<br />-Some asshole (probably an M1 dealer) makes a bunch of troll threads in the same format as my thread in an attempt to completely discredit my story<br />-Report to the mods, turns out they don&#039;t delete those threads because of the bizarre interpretation of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; <br />-Mod still hasn&#039;t refuted my argument<br />Will post the full transcript of the mod messages below to show what a tool he is

				MOD:<br /><br />Hi Junjo<br /><br />Whilst I understand your frustration we do not censor trolls on the SR forums, as such I am unable to take any action in respect to the posts/threads you are reporting.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />ssbd<br /><br />ME:<br /><br />are you kidding me?<br />this is supposed to be a harm reduction forum<br />trolling can cost lives here<br />because of this dude&#039;s troll posts, someone may have missed my story, used methylone carelessly, and then ended up dead<br />i know i&#039;m a newbie with no say, but if posting like that is allowed on this drug safety forum, then this forum serves no purpose.<br /><br />MOD:<br /><br />No I am not kidding you, I am being very honest with you.<br /><br />SR forums are build upon a foundation of free speech which means pretty much anything goes including trolling. Like I said you you before I appreciate your frustration however this is how SR forums operate so you will need to re-frame your perspectives if you are going to overcome your unhappiness with this aspect of how the forums run.<br /><br />Welcome to the road.<br /><br />ME:<br /><br />Can&#039;t find the reply but, basically said that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; is not a valid argument for trolling when it can put lives at danger. Just as the Silkroad does not allow the sale of items like weapons for the same reason. Trolling is all fun and games in other forums, but a harm reduction forum is not the place for it. When mocking people who were physically harmed by drugs, and posting inane suggestions about drug consumption that can land someone in a hospital or in the grave are perfectly allowed here, this forum might as well not exist.

				I think everyone who has read your concerns so far understands them.<br /><br />It is just that no one feels that these concerns trump the free speech aspect of this board.<br /><br />I do see your analogy to guns but discussion about guns isn&#039;t banned.&nbsp; Just the sale of them.<br /><br />There are some useful discussions about drug safety that go on here so just because there are trolls spreading useless information does not make the whole forum worthless.&nbsp; I assume most SR patrons are intelligent enough to weed out the bullshit from the truth.<br /><br />You clearly would&nbsp; like your post stickied or something because you spent time on it and it is a topic important to you but just move on man.&nbsp; You tried your best to make a post.&nbsp; Even if he didnt reply it is going to get buried within a week or two anyway under all of the other new threads that are being made.<br /><br />Again, by showing how upset you are I bet Dilbert is just grinning ear to ear.&nbsp; Go to bluelight if you want to have a meaningful conversation about this.

The exceptions that are in place, child porn and weapons, are there because they can cause physical harm to people other than the user, unlike drugs. By that logic, posting here should be the same way. You can say whatever the fuck you want, but if you post with the intent of either directly or indirectly harming other users, it should not be taken lightly. <br />And no, I don&#039;t give a shit about a sticky/personal attention. I just want people to be fucking safe and feel free so share their experiences without fear of being belittled. What is wrong with that?

				Your shrill self righteous whining has become more tiresome than the original Dilbert troll posts. And I&#039;m really not sure how you think they could get someone killed. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clearnet drug forums like bluelight&nbsp; feel they have to fly the &quot;harm reduction&quot; flag and insist on &#039;no sources&#039; to cover their asses. Here on SR we are freed from this hypocrisy.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its perfectly reasonable to alert people if you have a bad experience with a drug, but your original post was somewhat melodramatic: (&quot;MADE MY LIFE A LIVING HELL&quot;) and I guess that was what the troll was mocking.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And your post after post of butthurt complaining about it just made it funnier. I DEMAND ALL THOSE POSTS ARE REMOVED IMMEADIATELY THEY COULD KILL SOMEONE, WHAT KIND OF DRUG CRAZED MONSTERS ARE YOU?<br />

Even trolls should have freedom of speech, until they become too annoying (it seems like the troll posts have been removed then, so why do you still complain?) or harmful to others (and in this case they weren&#039;t just because your message was there for everyone to see, they couldn&#039;t tamper it in anyway).<br />I don&#039;t get what it changes to you or anybody&#039;s else if the guy is making fun of what you said. Does it change something on the advice you gave? No, isn&#039;t it? If some imbecile wants to not care and believe you are saying bullshit so be it, do you want to save others from their willingly decided fate as many religion figure want? Do you want to bestow your &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;salvation&quot; on others?<br /><br />You can give an advice (and also this is sometimes not a so good thing to do, until the advice is not asked, but there are certain exceptions) but you cannot impose anybody else to follow that advice. You just try to plant a seed but if the seed goes to infertile ground you cannot certainly change nature for your convenience. What does it change on what you have said if that guy made fun of it? Did he cancel what YOU said and expressed in some way? Did he harm your message in some way? <br /><br />No, isn&#039;t it? The problem here is just that you feel hurt in your ego and that&#039;s it. You care nothing about your &quot;message&quot; here, you care only that your supposed &quot;dignity&quot; has been violated by someone making fun of you, but the reality is this: it was NOT violated before, now it is... with what YOU yourself have done here.

You cannot even for once say to somebody: &quot;you are an idiot and what you say is bullshit&quot; just for that rule of &quot;not challenging other &#039;opinions&#039;&quot; on which they shelter themselves to never feel challenged in their security, growing their egos to impossible heights meanwhile. <br /><br />I once tried to enter in one of those forums to say that a certain post was an idiocy but I couldn&#039;t even enter just because I once &quot;challenged&quot; an idiot spreading misinformation around and this was seen as &quot;challenging other opinions&quot; and unacceptable. The only thing unacceptable is never having your point of view challenged by anyone else so that in the end you get so comfortable in your bullshit that you cannot isolate no more what&#039;s it from facts.
