				I wish to try some meth which will be likely good quality - never used speed/perscription type stims before.. im new to the amphetamines<br /><br />seeming its my first time i have a few questions. i already have purchased a meth pipe and intend to smoke it using that <br /><br />all i want is one great night on it for myself. I don&#039;t really want any more for the following days but at the same time i don&#039;t want to leave myself short that night.&nbsp; i intend to end the nights fun after about 6 to 8 hours of being fully high. i don&#039;t want to go on for days or into the next day..&nbsp; i just want a full experience starting at nightfall and be high for perhaps 6 to 8 hours-smoking it in the pipe. i will have 2mg xanax for when i want to go to sleep at the end. i know about keeping hydrated etc<br /><br /><br />1.) will 1 point of meth be good enough/too much/too little for 1 person for a good smoking night?<br />2.) how long does the high actually last before you need to have another re-dose smoke?<br />3.) how much should i put in the pipe per session of smoking? the whole point, half a point, quarter point?<br />4.) should i have 4 smoking sessions in this 8 hour night every two hours or will only 1 session be needed?<br />5.) is it likely i might only need a quarter point or half point worth for the entire night?<br /><br />if you have any advice on how i might try this &quot;special night&quot; and the dosing shedual with smoking as the R.O.A i will be thankful<br /><br /><br />thanks<br />

				One point shouldn&#039;t be a problem but if you think your gonna start at sunset and live it up for 8 hours before enjoy a good night&#039;s sleep you are in for a huge surprise. I can&#039;t imagine any first time user sleeping 8hrs after smoking meth. The meth will walk all over your 2mg of xanax. One point could easily be enough to keep you awake that night and into the following. For example between yesterday at 8am and now roughly 11am I&#039;ve been wide awake and my dosage was just under a point. I did roughly 90mg meth and been awake for 26hrs straight with out the need or desire to sleep. I will do a few small bumps here shortly and will be good to go well into this evening. If I do a few big bumps I will be set for another allnighter. Also keep your lighter just close enough to vaporize it not burn it. While on meth you will need lots of fluid, porn and things to keep you busy. If you want a 6-8hr high meth is not the drug for you ;-)
