				Just wondering if it is safe to use products from a local hardware store, or if I should be ordering a higher grade offline considering one has to ingest said product. Am I going to get a lot of impurities in my reaction if I do use hardware store grade, or will it be alright? Any other tips are much appreciated as this is my first GHB reaction, but not my first time messing with this stuff.<br /><br />-NS

				It depends on what reaction you are doing to get the GHB, when the chemicals are used (I could care less about heavy metal deposits if I plan on distilling later...), what chemicals, and what brands.&nbsp; Some brands have minute additives that I wouldn&#039;t want in my end products.&nbsp; Others are mixes of chemicals (think denatured alcohol), and others are relatively pure.&nbsp; Look up the MSDS of the brand you are considering using before doing so.&nbsp; If you have access to technical or, even better, lab grade reagents I would definitely use them.

You risk carrying all kinds of impurities into the final product which can negatively effect your health (and those of others if you are sharing it). <br /><br />Technical and &quot;lab&quot; grade reagents are also not good enough. Pharmaceutical grades (USP / BP) or sometimes hi-spec analytical grades are the only things that should used for drug manufacture - particularly with GHB where the active dose is in grams rather than milligrams.<br /><br />BG<br />

				It wildly depends really, If you have a reactant that is supposed to be 99% GBL, you can mostly assume that 99% figure to be correct. The problem is finding out what the other 1% is, and if could react to something dangerous that ends up in the end product. <br /><br />The rated grade of a chemical doesn&#039;t always answer the &#039;what is the rest&#039; question. For example water containing 99.99 percent of water woudl be perfectly fine as a ragent for synthesis or analysis. If the remaining 0.001% would be botulinium toxin however,&nbsp; drinkiing that water would be quite fatal, despite the 99.9 being perfectly valid.

				Do not use hardware store NaOH if you care about your health.&nbsp; Buy USP or food grade, which is readily available on eBay.
