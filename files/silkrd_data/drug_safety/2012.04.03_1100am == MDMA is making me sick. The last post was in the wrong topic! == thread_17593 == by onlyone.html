				I bought some MDMA off the road recently and ive had some very bad times since. This is the exact truth and i am not out to hurt any mdma vendors rep. I am actually posting this to see if anyone else had had the same reaction because im thinking it might be just me and my chemically unbalanced brain causing the issues.<br /><br />I wont say who it is from. It was bought in March from a vendor who seemed legit and i received the product in escrow.<br /><br />I dont know if it was mda, or mdea, or some mdxx possibility as I really have no experience or way of chemically testing it.<br /><br />It was gram, heavy with the bag. The product was white with small crystals. There was some powder in the bag but could be considered small crystals as its hard to tell. The taste test did not remind me of mdma. I havent tripped in a long time prior to this, but the last time i tripped some 10 years ago, was on pure mdma that tasted very distinctively, and this did not taste the same. This was bitter and similar to mdma, but was salty and slightly different. I dosed about 100mg my first dose and proceeded to trip balls.<br /><br />The trip reminded me of an acid trip as the walls were breathing and changing colors with each breath. There was no lovey dovey feeling of mdma, and i began to panic as the trip increased. I ran to the bathroom and vomited violently for a half an hour. As i puked i began to think how stupid i was for trusting silkroad and some person who i did not know and I began having a panic attack. I looked at myslef in the mirror and my pupils were so dilated i could not tell what color my eyes were.<br /><br />I was home alone and my wife was visiting family. She knew about the order so i told her my situation and she reassured me i would be okay and to relax. I was able to calm down but still was so high that i could not relax. I took an anti psychotic that I had laying around and when it kicked in i slept for 8 or so hours. I awoke feeling run down and hungover.<br /><br />I puked again and ate some soup and took a multi-vitamin.<br /><br />This was my first experience on this gram. I still had plenty and took a break after this bad trip. My wife wanted to trip, but because i was worried i denied her any. I took some a week later this time about 50mg poured in my drink. Came up feeling pretty happy and upped the dose. I ingested about 150mg this night over a period of 3 hours. The trip was manageable but i still vomited twice. I went to sleep around 5am that day and woke up an hour later sweating and with my heart rate extremely high. I woke up my wife and told her i had taken more. She got pissed and told me i would be ok. I made it through the night but felt extremely sick and loaded with anxiety.<br /><br />I was convinced this shit was sketchy but gave a friend a small dose of around 50mg. He enjoyed it and felt the effects strong enough to not want anymore for the whole night! I kept trying to offer more but he declined saying he was tripping balls from the small amount i gave him! I still have doubts about this as my friend is a known bullshitter who is capable of bullshit for sure. The only thing that bothers me is that i offered him free drugs and he wouldnt take them! This dude is the most drug hungry fiend i know and he still declined after the initial dose!<br /><br />So i was still confused about the potency at this point to say the least. I figured i had pure shit that was fire and at this point i still had over half the bag left! I made up some gel caps and continued to believe it was mdma. I sold some of it to a friend who took it. He loved it and told me shit was great except that he threw up as well! I warned him to go easy and he slowly increased his dose through the night. He to this day said he loved it and wants more.<br /><br />At this point i was thinking it must be me and my chemical imbalances. Maybe i just wasnt allowed to enjoy mdma anymore. I should mention that i did abuse the shit back in my late teenage years and contiuned this abuse for a few years. I decided to take it again a week later. I had no problems during the night and felt really good. I dosed in small increments (10 to 20mg snorted) until i felt good. I ended up using approx 150 mg this night as well. I felt good all night and fell asleep after the trip came down. I woke up an hour later and proceeded to projectile vomit for some of the worst hours of my life. I was puking and shitting at the same time. All the while I had extreme cramps in my intestinal area. After hours of torture I shit one last time and laid back down. Fell asleep for an hour and woke up and puked and shit again! This happened for the rest of the day. I vomited over five times and shit countless times. After a week of rest i am feeling fine again.<br /><br />I am sitting on my couch looking at the last 100mg or so...I dont know what to do. I really think this shit is fucking me up. I dont think its mdma at all but probably some mdxx. I never tasted anything mdma that tasted like this. I will remind you that I havent tripped on mdma since the late 90s. Ad the last legitimate&nbsp; trip i had was on 300mg of pure mdma that was spaced out in 3 100mg gel caps. I have attempted to trip since then, but i received bunk ass shit that i knew immediately was not mdma.<br /><br />Is anyone else in the same boat as me that remembers the good old days of mdma where you felt nothing but bliss! This is what i was loking for and got the exact opposite! I guess the reason for this post is to see if anyone else can relate to me. I feel like im poisoned on all the x ive done since the late 90s early 2000s. I mean that bitter taste i would get when i put the hit in my mouth has not been in any of the shit ive done in the past almost 10 years!<br /><br />This is a crazy long post, and thanks for reading. I just want to know if its me, or if other people are experiencing the same effects. I mean this shit isnt fun. I felt like i was dying! Thats not ecstacy! So did i ingest some suspect shit, or am i just so far chemically imbalanced that i will never be able to enjoy that mdma feeling again?<br /><br />Thanks again for reading this any any responses.&nbsp;

				It might be a good idea to list the specific vendor so you can see if other people got sick from that vendors stuff too. I mean sure it could be just your personal chemical reaction, but it could help square some things up and figure what went wrong. Heck they might give you a refund or resend maybe? And you don&#039;t want people out there panicking if their &#039;mystery&#039; mdma is somehow&#039; tainted&#039; too. Just suggesting.

				If you ever read the rumor mill section you will see that buyers sometimes don&#039;t care about &quot;bad mouthing&quot; a vendor. Most vendors are cool with complaints and try to work things out with buyers (IMHO). They are not supposed to do anything with your address or threaten you with it in any way. If they try to do that you can report them to Slik Road support. It would help to know what source of mdma you are talking about.&nbsp; Otherwise it is all one big guessing game. Just saying.

				Fuck! Why am i such a fiend? Ive got a 120mg left sitting in front of me and I have been fighting back ingesting this shit for a few hours now. Damn I was hoping for someone to come on here and be like YOURE RIGHT MAN! DONT DO IT! I HAD THE SAME REACTION AS YOU!! but i really didnt want this to happen at all. I think i have some strong ass shit that is just no joke. Im not even close to in good shape and havent been in the MDMA game for a long time. Im on SSRIs and im bipolar. I think i burned up all my serotonin a long time ago and still havent recovered. Fuck! Wish me luck im about to finish this shit up! If i die so be it! <br /><br />*Edit- If i start to wig out or start foaming at the mouth, i will come on here and post the vendors name. Risky2, dude i promise you even if i posted the name it wouldnt change anything. This vendor is not posting any mdma right now. Im not afraid of the vendor posting my name or address as this is a new account i made on the forums just to start this post and there is no way they could tie it back to me. If i felt that anyone was at risk i would post this persons name in a heartbeat. The fact of the matter is they are not selling any mdma and no one else at this moment can buy any of this batch. I dont feel that there is any reason to name the vendor. If someone is experiencing the same effects i would want to know and then come up with a plan. He/she is no longer selling mdma ATM. There is no reason for me to mention the sellers name just as i would not want them to mention my name. I am not dead and have ingested quite a bit of this substance. I def would not buy again, but i dont have that option anyway neither does anyone on SR. Im dropping this last bit here so wish me luck. If i have any negative reactions i will update. AGAIN THIS MDMA IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON SR! PLEASE IF YOU HAVE HAD THE SAME REACTION WE NEED TO TALK! Wish me luck!<br />

				SSRI&#039;s and MDMA do not mix. That&#039;s probably your problem. My friend who was on SSRI&#039;s tried MDMA and felt absolutely nothing. Adding a lot of alcohol to this mix will definitely bring on vomiting.

				Well this shit is processing through my system as I type this. I will post a follow up trip report sometime tomorrow, or maybe keep everyone interested up to date with periodical updates.<br /><br />I have a crazy trip report to post when i tripped back in 2001. Here it is:<br /><br />This shit was crazy. I almost died. My best friend offered me a free pill one night. My mother was about to get remarried the next day and i was being good as i was part of the wedding. So my friend offers me this pill. I tell him that one hit isnt going to do shit to me because at the time i was taking a minimum of two hits to even feel anything. &quot;You sure&quot; he asked. &quot;Fuck it ill try one&quot; I said. <br /><br />The pill was yellow. Smaller than an average for the time e pill, and had a smiley face on one side and no dash or markings whatsoever on the other. I put the hit in my mouth and instantly i knew something was up. Ive never tasted rat poison, but to this day i feel that this is the best way to explain this taste. It literally burned my tongue and mouth in a chemical way. It tasted suspect but unlike anyting i had experience in my life until this point. I swallowed it and shrugged off the taste as it wasnt important to me at the time. <br /><br />When it kicked in i remember telling my friedn it wasnt e. He said WTF? I said again that I feel like im tripping on acid. I was the only one in our group who had any experience with acid. He started to panic and asked me if i was sure. I told him not absolutely but this feels like an acid trip to me, and an intense one!<br /><br />After an hour or two of tripping nuts he said he had to go. Peace out i said. He headed home and left me to myself. I was really deeply tripping balls and was totally bugging out. Another friend of mine came through and told me he had dropped two of the smiley faces . I told him my concerns and he started to panic along with me.<br /><br />&quot;Fuck man&quot; &quot;why are you telling me this? I felt fine until i came over here!&quot;<br /><br />I said, &quot;dude this is not mdma!&quot; &quot;Im fucking tripping balls from one hit! This shit tasted like poison!&quot;<br /><br />We went to the store and I picked up a forty of budweisser. &quot;Dude im just fucked up and im gonna put this down to help sober up&quot;, I said.<br /><br />&quot;do whatcha gotta do&quot;he said.<br /><br />I chugged the forty down in two long ass chug sessions. &quot;Ok, im feeling better, maybe it was mdma and i was just buggin out&quot; i said.<br /><br />&quot;yea man thats what i was trying to tell you dude&quot; This shits fine,youre fine!&quot;he said<br /><br />within two minutes after chugging my beer i began throwing up projectile exorcist style puke on the street. &quot;FUCK&quot; i said in between hurls. &quot;Call an ambulance!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Really dude? Ok bro im calling&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No wait fuck that my mom is getting married and i dont want to fuck up the wedding tomorrow!&quot;<br /><br />He walked me home and said he had to go. I went upstairs to bed and laid down. The bed felt like i was in a race car crusing at 100mph. It was crazy. I went in the bathroom and took a cold shower to try and calm myself down. Eventually shit faded off and i was able to get a couple of hours sleep and go to the wedding as planned. It was fucking crazy to say the least. <br /><br />I came across those pills again from a trusted source and declined them for obvious reasons. <br /><br />I still to this day have not had a pill or powder that tasted anything like what i was used to and I use my taste buds as a test kit. <br /><br />I placed an order on SR with a vendor who was at the time seemed very reputable. So far my experiences with this batch have been nothing but horrible. I dont really know what else to say so i posted this in an attempt to get to some info from anyone who has been or is in the same boat as me. <br /><br />This shit is starting to kick in and i am feeling really good right now. Hope it stays this way.... <br /><br />Will report back in a few hours.... Thanks for reading and for any advice. <br /><br />Peace and love-

				Mr Molly:<br />Believe me if I didnt feel anything i would have contacted the vendor. I felt something for sure...and im feeling something right now....it just not what wanted to feel. I used to be addicted to mdma and used it all the time multiple times a day all the fucking time! Lol. Seriously though thats what i was looking for, but i think im just too fucked up in the head with serotonin and dopamine depletion.... <br /><br />I again do not want to scare anyone with this post but this shit is happening to me for real.....<br /><br />I hope for everyone heres sake that im just the fucked up oddball that is having a bad reaction. If thats the case then i am very grateful...&nbsp; I wouldnt wish a bad trip on my worst enemy...ok maybe thats not true.. but certainly not on an innocent person who just wanted to experience pure bliss as mdma has gotten me there so many times in my life! Thanks for the response though and the advice.

				Hmm,you first post made me think that you got AMT instead of mdma.Does the high lasts longer than&nbsp; hours and does the powder have a distinct strong smell that feels like it&#039;s stinging your nose,some say it reeks like &quot;mot balls&quot; or something.<br /><br />AMT is known to cause massive vomitting when ingested orally and also has a longer duration than mdma and in doses of 50 mg and up it will feel much more like acid.

				Thanks for the info Kundalini. Im pretty sure its an mdxx possibly even mdma. It just does not taste like the shit that I used to roll on. I get the feeling that mdma just isnt what it used to be to me anymore. I was using this shit way back when I was still shittin my diapers, lol. I dont want to give up mdma yet, but i also dont want to die or vomit because of a bad reaction. <br /><br />I made this post to see if anyone else has had the same problem? Its looking more and more like i need to schedule a visit to my doctor asap.

				Well there is a simple way to bypass the nausea , plugging.<br /><br />You could also try ingesting a full dose in multiple smaller doses, let&#039;s say fist ingest 50 mg then wait until you feel first effects then ingest annother 50 mg and then maybe annother 20-50 when you feel the effects of the second dose.

				It is impossible to roll on SSRIs believe me, i know. I&#039;m on them and I&#039;ve tried to roll a few times on what I knew was legit MDMA. It doesn&#039;t work. The SSRI blocks the receptors needed to produce the effect from molly. You may feel speedy and a little euphoric, but nothing near a roll. Sorry, but you will never be able to roll as long as your on the SSRIs.

				I&#039;ve dealt with peddlers of the utmost finery in regards to mdma, none of which are on the Road. Regardless of quality, frequent consumption of MDMA eventually brings upon an adverse reaction even in cases where the said substance was not consumed for several months. I know a number of people who respond to MDMA with nothing but vomiting, nausea, and regret.
