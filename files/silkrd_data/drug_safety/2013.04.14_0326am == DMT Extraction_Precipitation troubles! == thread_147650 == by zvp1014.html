				Hello, I&#039;ve been attempting to extract DMT from Acacia Confusa, using the following clearnet tekâ€“<br />http://www.psychonaut.com/ayahuasca-dmt/36008-how-extract-dmt-easy-low-cost-way.html<br /><br />It&#039;s failed twice so far. The first time I know I fucked up (there was a layer of naphtha, water, and settled DMT powder and I pulled it all up and put it in the trash bottle) so that was my bad.<br /><br />But the second time, I did everything to the book, and was careful to only pull the naphtha both in the defat and extraction. The final resulting fluid was urine-yellow.<br /><br />I put it in the freezer at the minimum temperature setting and let it sit in a glass dish for 26 hours. I pulled it out, I couldn&#039;t see any crystals through the yellow fluid, but it was murky with white powder flowing through it. I took up the naphtha with a pipette making sure that I didn&#039;t see any crystals flowing into it. When I&#039;d finally drained the dish, there appeared to be no crystallization on the sides or bottom; I ran a razor along it and still nothing.<br /><br />I put it into a different, colder freezer for 5 hours then tried again. Still nothing.<br /><br />Any ideas as to what may have gone wrong? I followed the guide to the word, and I know there are many variables so it&#039;s hard to guess what the problem may have been. Any specific problems you see with the tek itself? Any ideas what to try? I still have 40g of powdered Acacia.

				How big of a container and how much naphtha are you doing, with each pull?

				Will go have a smoke and give the tek a read through - I&#039;m always wary of any tek that says &quot;don&#039;t defat if using MH&quot;. If you defat mimosa, it does pull lipids from the solution, so anyone saying not to do it (because &quot;its not worth it&quot; or &quot;its a waste of time&quot; or &quot;theres hardly anything in it&quot;) is not someone whose work ethic I&#039;d want in my lab.<br /><br />Sorry - I&#039;ll get off my soap box and have a read. :-)

				Well, this looks to all intents and purposes as it should work if you did it by the book.<br /><br />From a problem solving perspective, I&#039;d be looking at the ph levels all the way through that. What naphtha you have can make night and day difference. <br /><br />Did you dissolve your lye into water as opposed to using powder directly (naughty)? If you had DMT in the solution, the only thing stopping it from being sucked into the naphtha would be the ph level. <br /><br />Or a gang of pixies with machine guns.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I make all this shit up. I have no knowledge of this subject whatsoever.... *glances at huge jug of DMT juice*<br /><br />Yeah, glancing again at that tek, pretty sure the /fail is at the caustic soda stage. Dissolve 50 - 60gs per litre of water - always add NaOH to water, slowly with stirring. Then use that as the lye source.<br /><br />If you are not already doing that. <br /><br />Yeah, don&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve been much help here. Going for that joint now that I didn&#039;t get yesterday. lol

				I have no personal experience with the particular tec you&#039;re using, but I can speculate that you need to get your naptha layer very very dry.&nbsp; DMT is very difficult to get to crystallize and it is hygroscopic (likes to associate with water). Best drying for something like naptha is magnesium sulfate if you can get it. Dump a bunch (I&#039;m embarrassed to say that I can&#039;t specify how much -10 gm/100mL?? - it&#039;s not that important how much) in there, let sit for an hour, and filter.&nbsp; Also, you can evaporate off some of your naptha and you might have better luck.

				You don&#039;t need anything extra like magnesium sulfate to dry the naptha..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; You can pm me and i will point you in the right direction with a more up to date tek.&nbsp; the tek you used -used way too little acacia, and other things can be done to burst the cell walls of the bark better to get higher yields.&nbsp; Took me a few tries before i started getting great results with acacia -great results mean snow white fluffy crystal.<br /><br />in many instances with acacia, especially starting with only 50 grams, YOU WON&#039;T GET CRYSTALS.&nbsp; you will get a yellow goo which is very active and unique with a hash oil consistency. Test shown it to be most dmt, other alkaloids in acacia confusa you will pull include NMT, which gives the dmt from acacia a very unique/cool mushroom effect and longer buzz; Though&nbsp; I have extracted acacia confusa several times, and have gotten white crystals in most instances instead of the goo.<br /><br />with acacia, it&#039;s better to use less naptha than mimosa, so you can leave the naptha saturated with as much dmt as possible, and it&#039;s easier to saturate to the max when lots of bark is used.&nbsp;
