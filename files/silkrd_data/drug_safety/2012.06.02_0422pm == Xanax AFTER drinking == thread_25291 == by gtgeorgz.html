				okay so I&#039;ve only tried xanax once, took a 0.25mg sliced pill before i went to bed last week. Didn&#039;t really feel anything apart from diminished anxiety plus i slept like a baby.&nbsp; 8) <br />So tomorrow night i&#039;m going to a lil party starting at 9pm were i&#039;ll probably be doing Mephedrone and a small amount of alcohol (probably 3/4beers at the most). AFTER the session, probably about 2/3AM in the morning, would it be safe to take 0.25/0.50mg of xanax? as i&#039;d like to sleep well after this session but i realize that alcohol and xanax don&#039;t mix well. <br />Thanks for help and sorry if this is kinda noobie.<br />&nbsp;::)

				I&#039;ve done it after coke and booze.. Tend to sleep very heavy! I&#039;d wait till about half hour after your last drink before you drop it and no more than 0.50mg...

				You&#039;ll want to be careful.&nbsp; I used to have a script for xanax to manage my anxiety because I was a raging alcoholic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since quit both because I couldn&#039;t manage it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d take a 1-2mg of xanax with my first drink of the night and it acts as a dual potentiate.&nbsp; (Xanax makes you feel more intoxicated, alcohol makes the xanax more potent..)<br /><br />Be very very careful, both of these are depressants and will slow your breathing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard stories of people dying from the combo.&nbsp; :(

				Combining benzo&#039;s with alcohol is generally recommended against because of the risk of respiratory depression. <br /><br />Realistically, if you are in good health, drinking&nbsp; 4 beers followed by half a milligram of xanax is not likely to kill you though. If you are not used to benzo&#039;s at all there is a fair chance of retrograde amnesia back to the point you started drinking though.&nbsp; The extent of that effect is hard to predict, but i would suggest doing this only when some friends are present - not just to get you home safely, but also to tell you what happened in case you do forget completely. <br /><br />Transient amnesia doesn&#039;t sound like that bad a thing until you actually experience it. Having no clue at all about what happened the night before can be pretty upsetting. It&#039;s unpleasant to not have a clue what you did when you were somewhat sober, very different from being too drunk to remember details.

				Um you kind of sound like a lightweight(not a bad thing, i&#039;m pretty jealous actually) but I think you should be able to figure that out yourself. It&#039;s your body. See how you feel at the end of the night you&#039;ll probably pass out from the beers anyway.
