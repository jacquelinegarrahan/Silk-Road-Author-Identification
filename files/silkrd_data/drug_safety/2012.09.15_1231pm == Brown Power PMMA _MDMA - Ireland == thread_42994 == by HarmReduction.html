				From a press article today ...<br /><br />The powder combination of ecstasy and the amphetamine PMMA found in Cork might be the first discovery of its kind in Europe.<br /><br />The EU drugs agency said&nbsp; yesterday it was not aware of any previous reports of a powdered version of the drug. <br /><br />A scientist with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction said while there had been reports of tablets combining the substances, the agency had not previously encountered a powder form. <br /><br />&quot;A powder containing MDMA and PMMA has not been reported to us. We have seen PMMA and MDMA in tablet form,&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />He said it was possible the powder combination had been found in a member state but not reported. <br /><br />Has anyone seen PMMA /MDMA power anywhere else would be very interested to hear .<br /><br />Thanks

				I got some coke off a dealer in Cork city a few weeks back and he gave me a little baggie of this brown stuff for free. It turns out it was this stuff, PMMA.<br />I was a little wasted when I met him, so couldn&#039;t remember what he told me it was. I text him a few days later to ask him and he told me. He said he had bad reviews about it, so wouldn&#039;t be selling it anymore.<br /><br />I took the smallest little bump of this stuff off a key and within minutes, I was puking my guts up. It was horrific.<br /><br />As already said, I hope this stuff is taken off the streets before any more harm is done to people.

				Things like this is why I use SR.<br /><br />Despite the anonymous nature of this site, it&#039;s still more regulated than buying from the streets. Many of the sellers here post test results to show that their product is pure. And people who scam or try to pass off bunk shit for the real thing get shutdown and blacklisted fairly quick. Also you&#039;re able to see feedback for specific sellers. <br /><br />Using SR requires a certain amount of sophistication because you need computer equipment and the technical savvy to obtain Bitcoins. Because of that it makes drugs seem more of a reward or luxury rather than just a substance that a common junkie gets his hands on to feed his addiction. If you&#039;re anything like me then you&#039;re fairly well educated on your drug use and your drug use is focused to achieve specific purposes.<br /><br />SR is the future...

				PMMA is bad news stay away, several people have died since a bunch of idiots thought it was a good idea to press pills containing PMMA. I honestly don&#039;t see any benefit in PMMA because you won&#039;t suffer from returning customers. Why is it so hard to understand that you will make more money the honest way instead of killing tons of people and lose your customers.<br /><br />- O.S.
