				I used to smoke a hell of a lot of skunk when I was growing up.<br />Say from the age of 15 to 19.<br />&nbsp;<br />I think it might have messed with my head in a way that is still damaging. <br /><br />Now when I smoke a cigarette I get anxiety.<br />Obliviously I try not to smoke.<br />Also when if I drink a lot I get anxiety on bad hangovers.<br /><br />All other times, generally speaking I am confident and in control.<br />Just when I pick up old habits things go bad <br /><br />Could this be linked to my mad weed smoking days?<br /><br />I would like to point out that I am not trying to criticize cannabis<br />and put it out to be some hard drug when its not. <br /><br />But we were smoking really nasty skunk at a time when our brains<br />were still developing. One of the people I used to smoke with has <br />more serious mental health problems to date, I think I have been quite<br />lucky.&nbsp;

				of course it&#039;s very likely that there&#039;s a link. It sounds to me like it might be more behavioural/psychological than &quot;brain damage&quot;. I used to smoke a lot of &quot;soap bar&quot; which was mixed with god-knows-what. I smoked for years and it came up strongly in therapy years later that it was the main cause of migraines, and quite substantial anxiety.<br /><br />Do you experience anxiety at other times?<br />What are your thought processes like when you start smoking a cigarette and begin to get anxious?<br /><br />Did you ever have any really stressful experiences related to smoking or psychedelics?

				This actually very common.&nbsp; A lot of people stop smoking weed around or after mid 20s because it starts to cause more and more anxiety for some reason, whereas they used to smoke daily and feel great.<br /><br />There have been studies that show smoking pot affects developing brains, but it&#039;s not clear whether that is THC or something else.&nbsp; Also, since pot isn&#039;t regulated, who knows if it could be from pesticides or other nasty toxins that growers might use on their crops.&nbsp; <br /><br />But this does not happen for everyone, and so there maybe be genetic predispositions, general health, psychological complications, etc.. involved too.<br /><br />At the same time, people start to drink more around these ages too and if you&#039;re drinking more you&#039;re prone to more anxiety as well.&nbsp; There could be a lot of factors involved, and there isn&#039;t much research on the subject because of marijuana&#039;s legal status unfortunately.

				I smoked pot from 14 years old on (heavily) and by the time I turned 19 - EXTREME ANXIETY every time I smoked.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even enjoy it at ALL.&nbsp; The only time I could smoke was by myself and if I took more than 1 tiny hit, I would have severe anxiety all by myself at home, over nothing.<br /><br />This has happened to around 6 or 7 of my friends as well.&nbsp; Always happens to people who have smoked for many years in their teens.&nbsp; The &quot;I just smoked now I&#039;m having a cannabis anxiety attack&quot; symptoms always showed up around 19-20 years old. Very strange phenomenon and I would love to see some studies done on it!<br /><br />None of these people nor I had anxiety of any kind when not smoking cannabis.&nbsp; It only happened as soon as we started to get high and didn&#039;t subside until we sobered up.&nbsp; Then no more anxiety.&nbsp; It was a REAL pain in the ass and I am now in my early 30&#039;s and I still get this anxiety if I smoke more than one mirco hit.&nbsp; It&#039;s real fuckt since it&#039;s one of my favorite plants on Earth.

				People should understand that cannabis IS a psychedelic and if someone doesn&#039;t believe this they just have to use it with a more powerful ROA than smoking (as for example oral, anal or either through the skin) and as such turning it into a recreational drug can naturally cause problems on the long run.<br /><br />Psychedelics AREN&#039;T used to have fun. If you search fun sooner or later you will have to face the reality that psychedelics aren&#039;t fun at all, and on the contrary they are made to test an challenge yourself, they represent the SATAN (Shaitan, adversary) as in the Book of Job, bringing to initiation through tests. You don&#039;t use psychedelics to have fun but for the experience in its totality, with yes, also the &quot;bad moments of suffering&quot; etc. etc. because they are almost more important than the &quot;good times&quot;.<br /><br />Naturally this can also not happen for various motives, but, especially if you are predisposed naturally to have more &quot;mystical depth&quot; in yourself (either you understanding it or not) then it will happen. Anxiety is a psychological crisis coming from the impossibility of the ego to accept a change, of whatever nature, and the way the anxiety manifests externally (as in &quot;thinking of going insane&quot; or &quot;thinking of dying&quot; etc. etc. depends on the type of change the ego cannot accept). Everytime you use the substance and that &quot;change&quot; presents itself so the anxiety will. If the change is strong enough (or you fight it too much), then, the anxiety will not go away even when sober and it will take a while to subside.
