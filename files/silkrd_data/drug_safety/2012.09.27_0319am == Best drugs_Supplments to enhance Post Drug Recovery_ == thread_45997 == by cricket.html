				I&#039;m looking for is supplements/ Drugs/ Practices that help you &quot; Recover during/after drug use&quot; <br /><br />Obviously after you use a drug your natural chemicals go down and you Feel Lazy/Apathetic have no motivation and the world loses the glow it had when you were on the drug..... Everything is possible (with the right mind set) you just need to know how, so Id like to share my theories and experiences with you guys.....If I workout, I don&#039;t feel hungover/withdraw the next day, Also meditation and focus on control over my own body and knowing that no substance can make me dependent on it ( IN my mind) Helps greatly with having&nbsp; Little-NO After effects (withdraws)&nbsp; from Prescription opiate use. <br /><br />The Main reason for my Drug use is as follows<br />1. Enhance Creativity ( I&#039;m a writer/ Musician )&nbsp; &nbsp;What drugs are good for this? <br />2. Enhance Spirituality (Including opening doors and looking at life in new ways) <br />3. Enhance My life&nbsp; ( I believe and have seen/ experienced&nbsp; responsible drug users ENHANCE themselves with drugs)&nbsp; What drugs work here? Would adderal or modanfil help with productivity <br />Celebrities are a good example they use drugs to enhance there creativity/ or even enhance there personality (More sociability) <br />4. Goes along with 3, But I&#039;ve found drugs can really help in social situations. <br /><br />That being Said I&#039;m VERY interested in some Nootropics (Brain Enhancing Drugs) <br />How is Modanifil? Adderall? <br />Any other alternatives that will actually increase your brains capacity/ creativity. <br />For example L-Tyrosine is an amino acid that helps produce endorphins naturally<br />5-htp is another drug i&#039;ve been reading into. <br /><br />( I&#039;ve Never Tried E, If someone could educate me beyond the (obvious) on the difference between E and MDMA I&#039;d appreciate it) <br />The main thing with E is as stated I&#039;ve heard is has a VERY negative impact long term.....<br /><br />So to sum it up<br />1. I&#039;m looking for supplements that will help your brain/ Body recover....<br />2. Drugs that increase creativity <br />3. Drugs that increase productivity<br />4. Drugs that help to make you &quot;smarter&quot; <br /><br />What drugs could bring effects close (obviously not exactly like)&nbsp; The Movie LIMITLESS <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I didn&#039;t read all that shit, but if I get you, I would say dexamphetamine and valium or something. For any drug hangover; benzos, maybe opiates depending. Other than that if you wana be simultaneously stimulated? I dunno a cappucino? Or a Vyvanse? Or you could just eat a fat oxy that would probably remedy the whole situation hah.

				Have you tried meditation? I find meditation on the chakras and on my energy flows to be very helpful. If you&#039;re prone to addictions switching one addiction for another may not be the wisest move. That said, the classic psychedelics (psilocybin, lsd) are known to help addicts in their cravings. Meditation and physical exercise can be very cleansing for the body and mind.

				not trying to preach but to anyone but first learn to appreciate the subtle trip called reality, without drugs.&nbsp; Once you have a hold on that trip, drugs can be layered and morph into that reality as one.<br /><br />5htp is subtle but very helpful, i like to combine with beta carotene acetyl l carnitine and alpha lipoic acid and melatonin.&nbsp; eat very healthy -i don&#039;t feel like getting into diet now.&nbsp; you can get lost with the weed by overdosing and loosing focus on the wrong strain, but i also supplement with vitamins thc.&nbsp; after a good 30 min + run, i feel as good as any low dose mdma could put me. <br /><br />to make material progress on earth you gotta be grounded in the natural first. these do align to the chakras if your into meditation with such reality symbols.&nbsp; the top of the grid is closer together to symbolize the closeness in higher vibrations.&nbsp; <br />this my personal grid of thought in regard to some drugs, it can be layered with reality..&nbsp; &nbsp;[spiritual, egotistical, moving forward,&nbsp; stepping back].&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; psychedelics<br />phens&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tryps<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;natural<br /><br />benzos&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dissociative<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opiates&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				If you&#039;re dehydrated from too much booze or have been really active sweating all night 1000mL of normal saline IV helps me.... I don&#039;t like to give myself vitamins IV in case the vein blows but I usually take one of those &quot;Emergen-C&quot; B vitamin and Vitamin C vitamin packs. I also just try to eat a good meal and drink something healthy (non caffeinated, low or zero sugar).<br /><br />If i&#039;ve been up half the night and need to get things done the next day, a ritalin or adderall usually does the trick. Not a great choice compared to hydrating and calories but it&#039;ll get ya though the day haha

				Hello friend, <br /><br />Let&#039;s cut to the chase ...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45997.msg488537#msg488537">Quote from: cricket on September 27, 2012, 03:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Recover during/after drug use&quot; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Depends on the drug. If you are using alcohol, there is a compound called Dihydromyricetin (available on SR) that will block the receptors responsible for drunkeness and ease the hangover symptoms. If you take too much too early though, you won&#039;t be able to get drunk though. <br /><br />For MDMA, taking it with high dose Vitamin C will all but negate any hangover. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45997.msg488537#msg488537">Quote from: cricket on September 27, 2012, 03:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Enhance Creativity ( I&#039;m a writer/ Musician )&nbsp; &nbsp;What drugs are good for this? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A lot of people say Tyrptamines (LSD, mushrooms, 2C&#039;s etc) but I disagree.

He&#039;s very good. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45997.msg488537#msg488537">Quote from: cricket on September 27, 2012, 03:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">( I&#039;ve Never Tried E, If someone could educate me beyond the (obvious) on the difference between E and MDMA I&#039;d appreciate it) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />E = MDMA but usually in pill form and usually mixed with caffeine, or other crap, if it&#039;s MDMA at all. <br /><br />Stick to MDMA crystals.

Jury is still out. <br /><br />Serotonin levels return to normal within 7 days with no evidence of brain damage / toxicity with a regular recreational dose. It&#039;s only through overuse, dehydration and the possible adulterants added to impure MDMA that will damage you. Use with nootropics for long term protection. <br /><br />You haven&#039;t tried it? Good god man, put some in your cart!
