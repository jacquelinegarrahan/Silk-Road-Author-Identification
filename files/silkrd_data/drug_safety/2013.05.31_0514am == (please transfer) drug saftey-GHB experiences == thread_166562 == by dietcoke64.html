				Hey,<br />First of all, this is not a &quot;newbie&quot; post, just for some reason I can&#039;t start a new discussion topic in the drug safety forum? I even made a new account but it doesn&#039;t seem to make a difference. Hopefully a mod can transfer this topic.<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to discuss my GHB experience and get some feedback. I&#039;m sorry if this is really fucking long but I want to give my background on using GHB so people understand where I&#039;m coming from. You can skip the following part if you just want to get to the point of my post.<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~<br />I have been doing GHB for over a year now. I started doing it occasionally for adderall comedowns and it was great - it made me relaxed and got me to sleep. <br /><br />Then I started realizing how great GHB was on it&#039;s own. It became my favorite drug - it didn&#039;t make me act retarded, like alcohol, it didn&#039;t make me have the ups/downs of stimulants (or the anxiety), and I was good at using it once in awhile.<br /><br />Anyway then of course I got sucked into using GHB daily because it felt so great and I could act &quot;normally&quot; and nobody could tell I was on drugs. I was also abusing phenibut at the time, not knowing that they were both acting on the GABAb receptors. And of course one day came my downfall - all of a sudden one night, GHB failed me. I became an emotional basket case (everything made me cry), I stopped sleeping for at least a week (without literally a wink of sleep), I was having panic attacks and hallucinating while trying to hold down a job, etc. It was the worst experience of my entrie life, and believe me, I have had BAD drug experiences. This was beyond nuts. <br /><br />One day my silkroad order of valium came in the mail (my saviour). Oh my god what a relief benzos gave me. After my first night of valium my withdrawal was gone. I had become horrified at GHB/phenibut and completely cut them out of my life.<br /><br />That fall I started using GHB recreationally again. I was definitely over abusing it but somehow managed to escape withdrawal when my supply ran out (although I still had valium on my hands, thank god). I used GHB for about a month or two (not constantly, about a few times a week) before running out and deciding not to buy anymore.<br /><br />Then in February I became drug-curious again. I still didn&#039;t tolerate alcohol well, marijuana just made me nervous and quiet, and every other drug I had pretty much tried before and dismissed. So I bought some POWDER GHB and thought I had it alll under control cause I could just weigh the GHB on my scale and not run into trouble.<br /><br />But of course I did. My scale turned out to be bunk, so i was experimenting with doses that were probably wayy too high. I started passing out (luckily without running into danger), waking up and throwing up, my ears would be ringing and popping, and yet I would feel compelled it try it again within a day or two. Of course, eventually it stopped working. I became all emotional again. I threw out my remaining supply but unfortunately was out of valium for the next five days (except for this cheap shit that I ordered, that I&#039;m quite sure wasn&#039;t valium), and I was in worse GHB-withdrawl hell than the summer before. My first two days of withdrawal I went to work - which was hell, every sound freaked the hell out of me, I felt like I was in another world, I was crying for no reason and trying to hide it from my coworkers. The next few days I called in sick or had the days off (thank god). I was afraid to leave my room, or even my bed, or even to move. I curled up in the ball and watched the entire series of The Office non-stop in order to distract myself from scary thoughts (for some reason, The Office was the only show I found comforting/not &quot;scary&quot;.) I was sweating, tremoring and of course not sleeping. Later, after speaking to a psychiatrist, he said I should have definitely been in the hospital because I was on the verge of a seizure. ANYWAY, I finally got my valium prescription. I had been taking 20mg prior to the withdrawal, but not all of a sudden 5mg was a bliss (and yeah, I realize in retrospect I was simultaneously going through GHB withdrawl and benzo withdrawal - what a trip). <br /><br />The end of that withdrawal got me off drugs for awhile obviously. I did occasionally did coke when I partied, and came to abuse alcohol quite a bit despite my dislike of it, but I had eliminated the GHB.<br />~~~~~~<br /><br />Okay so that&#039;s the end of my long ass detailed history of GHB. It has been a very heavy up and down relationship.<br /><br />So it&#039;s now almost June, and after avoiding silk road for awhile, I signed on and found some left over bit coins in my account. And then I found some cheap domestic GHB. I thought...hey, what the hell, it&#039;s been five months and I think I&#039;ve learned my lesson about abusing GHB. I thought that, considering I am sick of alcohol and other drugs, I could use some GHB for some OCCASIONAL fun.<br /><br />I received my GHB a few days ago. And the first day .. I ended up in the hospital. I took a vial (after reading the feedback on the GHB, one vial seemed appropriate), and I was fine. I was experiencing the bliss of GHB and was fine. A few hours later, thinking that it had worn off, I took a bit more because I didn&#039;t want to feel grumpy while coming off of it. I have done this before - taken a bit more hours later, and been perfect fine. But I collapsed in front of my family when meeting them for dinner. Apparently I was foaming at the mouth, I was repeating the words &quot;pardon&quot; and &quot;no, I&#039;m fine thanks&quot; and slipping in and out of consciousness. I remember all of that part, and I remember the paramedics taking me to the hospital (luckily they found the vial in my purse and knew it was GHB so they didn&#039;t do any crazy treatment on me). In the hospital, I fell in and out of sleep and didn&#039;t throw up. My heart and blood pressure was healthy. But the experience was traumatizing, for me and my family obviously.<br /><br />So now just I&#039;m thinking - did my two previous episodes of withdrawal, even though they were spaced months apart, and what with the last one being five months ago, completely fuck over my response to GHB? I remember before I started taking GHB I though it was safe if consumed responsibly and obviously not mixed with alcohol, etc. I thought the whole &quot;GHB is dangerous&quot; was blown out of proportion. I did a lot of research on the internet. Now I&#039;m reading about episodes of people dying taking GHB. Could I have died in that incident that occurred a few days ago? What kind of dosage do you have to take to die from just taking GHB? Am I more prone to overdose now? Even after not taking it for months, is my tolerance something ridiculous?<br /><br />I&#039;m actually kind of experiencing withdrawal just from that one incident. Luckily I have some clonazepam to help me through this. Maybe it&#039;s just the rebound anxiety, but I&#039;m fearing for my health. I know the best advice is to throw it away, stop taking it. I know it&#039;s &quot;the right thing to do&quot;. But I still have that little drug seeker inside of me. What if I took another vial in a few days (in the safety of my home). Would it just be hell all over again? Should I just give up on GHB for life?

				It sounds like the problem is that you took the dose you used when you had a tolerance, when you no longer had a tolerance. If had taken 1.5ml of GHB on my first go, I may have ended up in the hospital as well. <br />It also sound like your brain may have upregulated the GHB receptors, and the withdrawal you&#039;re experiencing is actually withdrawal. You&#039;ve awoken an unnaturally large number of (what were previously) dormant GHB receptors, and now they&#039;re awake and hungry. Look around the site &quot;LONGECITY&quot;. You may find so information about how to minimize how you respond to G. Either way, it really just sounds like you need to find the strength to stay away from the substances that induce such a strong GABAB response. Intensely messing around with the GABA system has some seriously nasty consequences.
