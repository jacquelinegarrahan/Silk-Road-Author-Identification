				not everyone responds to drugs the same.<br /><br />just because you feel that way on benzos doesnt mean most people do<br /><br />i dont enjoy the way stimulants make me feel, but obviously many other people use them recreationally <br /><br />benzos can be relaxing, dis-inhibiting, anxiolytic, slightly euphoric, sedating - just depends on the individual and what exactly you are wanting from the drug<br /><br />some people, such as me, dont enjoy alcohol at all... but rather find benzos to facilitate social interaction and relaxation in much the same way people drink socially

				I&#039;m not a big alcohol guy myself, TBH. And I didn&#039;t mean to come off coarse and elitist about the drugs I personally do, I should have phrased it better. <br /><br />But it&#039;s almost as if they produce the opposite of antixiolytic effect in me. I get sick and then I stay worried. But you&#039;re most definitely right, everyone&#039;s body is different... My fav. drugs are stimulants and empathogens so anything that really slows ya down and chills ya out I&#039;m not really all for. Except for opiates, of course.<br /><br />I just found it really weird that I pretty much have NO positive benefit from Benzos. But most other drugs I&#039;m pretty sensitive too. Quite weird.

				also they seem to have the common effect of bringing on some very serious rage and violent outbursts..typicaly the next day when your motor skills are back on track lol..ive got dozens on scars to back this. they are nasty little shits , but mainly because of how good they seem to be.. if that makes any sense. its all about moderation and knowing your limits, also as modest mouse said shit will not effect everyone exactly the same but every one here seems to have covered the jist of it. goodluck, stay safe!

				There is no single answer in how a decent dose of benzo&#039;s will make you feel, but i&#039;d say beforehand they are not very good recreational drugs at all. <br /><br />Commonly they just give a calming and pleasant effect, take away you worries for a bit and such. Some people describe a sort of &#039;warn and fuzzy&#039; effect, which i think is mostly there when you take them just before going to bed or plunging down on a comfy coach. <br /><br />Personally i&#039;d say the effect is mostly comparable to what you feed after a night of slow drinking at a dinner table. The upside is that you will -probably- not be &#039;drunk&#039; enough to stumble around and fall on your face, and that the &#039;hangover&#039; isn&#039;t that bad either. Downside is that tolerance to this effect of benzo&#039;s developes rather quickly.<br /><br />

				What do you plan on using it for?<br /><br />Benzos effect people differently. I took some to see if it would help my social anxiety. It did do that, very well in fact. But on the downside it badly effected my memory (half the stuff I said while I was on it I couldn&#039;t remember. I forgot what day it was even.) Plus it made me kinda crazy. I told multiple girls that I loved them and threatened to beat up one guy. I even tried to drink when I was on it even though I knew it was a dangerous combination. I took one sip of alcohol and it immediately knocked me out which is probably a good thing. I hear it&#039;s also highly addicting although I haven&#039;t done it enough times to know what the withdrawal is like.<br /><br />Most people who take benzos are trying to get rid of some kind of anxiety. If you don&#039;t have anxiety, I don&#039;t see why you would take them other than to come down from a stimulant high.

You can get some nausia (if you are very sensitive to it) on large doses since they will cause balance problems resulting in a condition comparable to seasickness. Most recreational users will be vast asleep before that becomes a problem though. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The thing about it is that I DO have a lot of anxiety.

Psychotherapists frequently see patients that suffer for symptoms that would be hard to explain to the average person - dealing with that is part of their profession. Recognizing symptoms from rather vague descriptions is part of it too. If you seek therapy you usually do so because you have some issue that is hard for others to relate to, let alone give good advise on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes symptoms can be very odd. You can, for example, lose your sense of balance due to stress or anxiety, while there is nothing wrong with your inner ear or brain that would explain that. Having such a condition checked out in a hospital isn&#039;t a bad idea though, since there could actually could be a physical problem that can be remedied or at least managed.

I took it last night and today, but frankly I&#039;m not a doctor and from what I gather that is precisely what you need. If when you use drugs you have to binge than you should stay away from benzos, far away. But you definitely have some mental health issues that need to be addressed. You say you find it hard to describe, but you just described it pretty well and it sounds like fairly serious anxiety along with something else that I am not qualified to diagnose. Try to seek out a good mental health professional.

If you are having this discussion with your GP, he&#039;ll probably refer you to a specialist.<br /><br />Personally i&#039;d consider SSRI&#039;s as the last resort rather then the first viable treatment option. They can be very effective for some conditions, but the side effect profile is so bad that i don&#039;t really consider it ethical to use them as the first treatment option anymore. <br /><br />

I took it last night and today, but frankly I&#039;m not a doctor and from what I gather that is precisely what you need. If when you use drugs you have to binge than you should stay away from benzos, far away. But you definitely have some mental health issues that need to be addressed. You say you find it hard to describe, but you just described it pretty well and it sounds like fairly serious anxiety along with something else that I am not qualified to diagnose. Try to seek out a good mental health professional.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is true. I make myself sound like a grand ol&#039; junkie, haha. I&#039;m really not that bad. I keep my drug abuse to a minimum I just tend to do a whole lot on the days I do decide to do drugs. I wouldn&#039;t really have a problem with taking a medication as it was prescribed if I was prescribed that.<br /><br />I just have a big fear of going to a psychiatrist or psychologist and them putting me on an SSRI. I don&#039;t trust SSRI&#039;s, and most people I know who&#039;ve gone on them have wound up WAY more depressed than before. <br /><br />Can you refuse to take a certain medication if you&#039;re against it? Will they try and give you something else or just tell you to deal with it on your own?<br /><br />I apologize for all the questions, haha. I&#039;m just curious about it all since I&#039;ve never gone through this whole process before.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course you can. You can tell the Doc to go fuck himself and walk outta the room. Aside from being charged for appointment, you can do whatever the fuck you want. I was on Zoloft for a few months for panic disorder, I also had a distrsut for them, they just seem weird and sketchy to me, although in reality they are probably less sketchy than addictive ass benzos. But anyway, Zoloft didn;t last for me although I do think it made a bit of positive difference, I just didn;t like the 24/7 aspect of it. Like I was medicated literally 24/7 by taking one daily pill, fuckin weird. But, honestly my situation is not very dire, if yours is you should see a good Doc and be open to recommendations.

				Yeah, I appreciate the advice. I&#039;ll probably wind up going to see someone about everything once I gather some money together.<br /><br />If I sounded morose or anything disregard it, hahaha. I&#039;m not depressed really, it&#039;s more of a &#039;i&#039;m nervous all the time for no good reason&#039; kind of thing. I&#039;m generally a happy person and dont get upset a lot over much, but just like focusing on more than one person at a time in a conversation or being around a bunch of people talking makes me stressed as shit &#039;cause I can&#039;t focus on anything in particular. And then if I stay in those situations I get bad panic attacks. Usually when I have a panic attack my asthma inhaler calms me down &#039;cause it lets me at least breathe, though, haha.<br /><br />But anyway, Thanks guys! I&#039;ll take the advice to heart.
