				i&#039;m thinking of trying it because i feel tired all the time. sometimes i sleep like 16 hours/day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hear testosterone gives you more energy, but i don&#039;t want my balls to shrivel up any more than what they already are. i dont like to IV drugs, so what do i need? and don&#039;t say meth, i&#039;ve been down that road before and i&#039;m not going back.

				I would recommend speaking to your doctor before trying anything, especially since testosterone therapy in an otherwise healthy male isn&#039;t really ideal, and sometimes the side effects can outweigh the potential benefits.<br /><br />I know this probably isn&#039;t the best answer, nor the one you are looking for, but for the good of your own health and safety, just please see your doctor.<br /><br />After that is all said and done, and you still would like to continue on this path, I will do my best to help as much as I can.<br /><br />Best of luck,<br />sdesu

				Taking testosterone for &quot;low energy&quot; is like using explosives to get rid of your garden weeds. Playing with your hormones levels is something you should be careful. There are a number of things you may want to try before you go that path but you need to inform yourself of pros and cons.&nbsp; Google&nbsp; &quot;Clenbuterol&quot; and take it from there.

Not sure about your age, but most men start having declining Test Levels after 45. He&#039;ll check your Test levels after a morning Fast. If your levels are under 500 ml oer nanaogram, then you have a problem. Testosterone gel/every day followed by 1ml of some sort of injectible Testosterone every 2 weeks will keep your levels above 700 and you will in fact feel a huge diff. Now if your under 35, you will do more damage than cure.<br /><br />oppy

				DO NOT EVER EVER EVER shoot testosterone/steroids IV.....sorry for the caps but theres a very good reason. Steroid injectables are oil-based not water based and shooting an oil-based solution IV will cause pulmonary embolism at best and most likely death. Oil gets stuck in the lungs and youll die. Please people be very careful when it comes to IV its no joke.

				Please do not inject testosterone IV!<br />Also, see about possible alternatives to injections if they are available to you. Injections tend to take effect pretty quick but sometimes tend to wear off just short of the two week stretch, giving an up then down roller coaster effect, not to mention it can cause serious liver and renal damage if not properly dosed/administered/monitored. <br /><br />sdesu

				Intramuscular injection is the way to go. Oral steroids make an extra pass through your liver and cause far more damage than injection. I would recommend testosterone enanthate. It is a longer lasting test that you would inject every couple of days as opposed to daily. I would go to bodybuilding.com for dosing info.<br /><br />Your balls will only atrophy if you stay on a cycle too long without giving them a chance to produce natural test. I think 8-10 weeks on a cycle is recommended. Good luck, I hope you find more energy without test, as a lot of dudes are lifetime users of it, be careful.

				It wouldn&#039;t be cost effective to use Test for energy reasons.<br /><br />Now if you&#039;d like to use it for energy, muscle gain and fat loss that would be a better use of funds. Its not a take a shot and sit on your ass type of drug although - You&#039;ve got to be consuming carefully macro nutrient meals timed correctly through out the day with a dedication to working out. It can&#039;t be squatting bread loafs either, you&#039;ve got to be fucking man handling parked buses and shit. Jogging post workout to maintain a cardiovascular strength to keep up with the added weight you&#039;ll pack on.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t take the right precautions, you&#039;ll retain mostly water and look &quot;puffy&quot; -- stacking Clen/T3 or Winstrol works to tighten the muscle tissues. I would suggesting buying your Post Cycle Therapy (Nolvadex or Clomid) gear before actually getting the steroids - When you are injecting 500mcg of Test weekly, your balls, being the lazy fucktards they are, stop producing Test. You need the PCT to cover that 3 week bridge from having no Test present to your nuts churning out normal levels. <br /><br />If you would like to do the most dramatic thing to your energy levels, try watching your diet intake very carefully. You&#039;d be amazed how you feel from a week of eating mostly organic vegetables, lean meats, non-processed grains and drinking lots of water. Check out the documentary &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot;<br />
