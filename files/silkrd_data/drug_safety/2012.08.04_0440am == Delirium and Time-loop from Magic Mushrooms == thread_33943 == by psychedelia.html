				Two weeks ago I ingested 60mg of Adderall, followed by&nbsp; too many magic mushrooms, too many shots of vodka, and too much hashish.<br /><br />The hashish was the last thing I took before going to bed. As I began to fall asleep, I started having the strangest closed-eye visuals I&#039;ve ever experienced. I enjoyed them at first, but they soon turned into a hellish nightmare. I started to feel that I was leaving my body. I got scared, so I decided to keep my eyes open and try to stay grounded in reality, but it was very dark and I often doubted whether my eyes were open or closed. Although I am not a superstitious person, I had so lost touch with reality that I believed my brain was being invaded by beings of a demonic or extraterrestrial origin. I heard their voices, saw them all around me, and I had no doubt at the time that they were real. In this state of mind, I ran out of my house half-naked. I saw the beings all around me and heard them coming from all directions. I was trying to escape them. <br /><br />THE TIME-LOOP<br /><br />This is when things got very strange. As preposterous as it sounds, I kept reliving the same moment over and over again: I walked by a church, a puddle, and a white car. I then walked by the same church, the same puddle, and the same white car again. Over and over again, seemingly without end. And then I couldn&#039;t remember how I got there. I started to fear that something had killed me, and I had been doing this for years. I thought I was in purgatory, doomed to repeat the same moment for all eternity. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced. Subjectively the duration of the trip was over 100 years. It literally felt like it lasted longer than my actual lifetime, and it was all the same thing endlessly repeating itself.<br /><br />DELIRIUM<br /><br />By the time I made my way to a friend&#039;s house,&nbsp; I was completely delirious. I was angry because I thought the birds were laughing at me.&nbsp; I thought I was in an airport, and I thought I could hear people shouting at me from all directions, even though we were alone together in his living room. I saw snakes on the ground and spiders crawling all over my arms.&nbsp; I kept hearing a woman calling my name, but my friend assured me there was no one around. I also saw a cat curling up around my leg, but there was no cat in the house. I remember thinking it was a matter of urgency where my body was because I thought I had left it somewhere else.<br /><br />By the way: I once had a very similar time-loop experience with just LSD, so I know that it wasn&#039;t the interaction of the amphetamine or alcohol that caused this reaction. It was caused by the mushrooms, and possibly potentiated by the hashish.<br /><br />Has anyone else had a time-loop type experience from psychedelics, where you seem to relive the same moment over and over again? Has anyone else had a similar deliriant type experience from a psychedelic? I would be interested in reading about other people&#039;s experiences because I&#039;ve never read about these kinds of experiences in the psychedelic literature.

				This is when you lay down and let go. I think the alcohol and Adderall are what did you wrong.<br /><br />Loops can be beautiful and can let you see the true nature of the universe (or so it feels like). But you have to let go of your ego and merge with all that is.

				Alcohol tends to fuck up a lot of my trips. Gotta learn to just let go and let the trip take you wherever it wants to take you.

				I had something like this happen to me when I took some strong acid. I wasn&#039;t half-asleep but I certainly wasn&#039;t fully conscious and I kept seeing the same scene (office workers walking in a loop, continuously ashing their cigars in each others&#039; cups of coffee -- very strange)&nbsp; over and over and over for about an hour. I could probably tack some symbolism onto it, but man was it bizarre..

				booze and speed will fuck up your trip.&nbsp; you might have thought it was cool and novel if you weren&#039;t all hopped up on dark magic when you took the shrooms
