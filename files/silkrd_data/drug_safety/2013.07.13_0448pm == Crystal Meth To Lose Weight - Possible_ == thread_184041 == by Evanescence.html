				I wouldn&#039;t recommend it...there are better drugs one can use to accomplish this task that don&#039;t mess with brain chemistry as much as methamphetamine.<br />Just using racemic or dextroamphetamine would be better. And what about phentermine? That&#039;s actually made for weight loss and it&#039;s a stimulant.

				No don&#039;t use any stimulant just to lose weight.&nbsp; Yes it works but you will lose muscle mass if you are not careful.&nbsp; Remember this stuffs tells the body there is a life threatening emergency and it needs to fight, so building / preserving muscle, peripheral ciruculation, immune system, basically anything to with living more than the next hour, is shut down.&nbsp; It&#039;s an evolutionary response we are playing with.&nbsp; Remember that, everything has a price.<br /><br />What I can tell you is that yes it can work, but you will need to read up heavily in this thread before even considering it.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br />And get in to heavy full on weight training.&nbsp; Not only will the amph reinforce that behaviour (dopamine rewards behaviour and reinforces it), so at the very least it should help you avoid losing muscle mass, while making you WANT to stay healthy and weight train even when long off it (dopamine reward / psychological conditioning, like sex, dopamine does the same thing there so we keep doing it and reproduce).<br /><br />If you lose muscle mass you&#039;ll turn in to a weedy meth head loser (you don&#039;t want that) in addition to being unable to keep the weight off, because you need muscle mass to keep metabolism up and keep weight off.<br /><br />Remember the key is muscle mass.&nbsp; Yes you can lose weight, but you need muscle mass more than to lose weight or you&#039;ll just end up with less muscle at the end, an even lower metabolism, aged 10x faster, and even fatter as the weight will come back on real hard (because you don&#039;t have muscle to burn it).<br /><br />I&#039;d strongly recommend you get in to a healthy routine first and learn weight training.&nbsp; If you can spend a heap of money on this, you can afford a few hours with a personal trainer and on some quality supplements.<br /><br />And remember, always remember, this is a life saving piece of advice here, if you exercise or dance or run around or do anything for hours on this with your blood vessels constricted (even coffee does this, all stimulants including the &#039;harmless&#039; ones recommended in this thread, they may even be WORSE), you will put your heart and blood vessels under intense stress.&nbsp; I could be wrong (someone tell me if I am) but you need to look in to vaso-dilators to compensate for this and re-open the blood vessels to reduce strain on the heart for one, and also feel even more amazing by letting blood and oxygen through again.<br /><br />If I&#039;m not mistaken, one of the best sources of vaso-dilators is nitrates which is in beetroot, so beetroot juice may be a good combination, and fairly cheap from any quality health food store or even juice it up yourself?<br /><br />Please treat this advice with caution though, I&#039;ve been doing it and it feels great, even on it&#039;s own beetroot juice just gets me loaded, but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s healthy or safe or what... just a suggestion though.

				Indeed for women i do not recommend it.<br />Specially since women have harder time putting on muscle mass.<br /><br />But if you do go that path for just appetite repression i would only reccomend regular amphetamines.<br />And make sure you have a good nights sleep so take only therapeutic doses.<br />(it&#039;s not an ACCUAL fatburner remember)<br /><br />Have a good diet ..this meaning a strict plan of calorie intake.<br /><br />The bodybuilder&#039;s way is the correct way.<br /><br />Meaning: <br /><br />- calculate the amount of kcal you need each day.<br />Don&#039;t go under it.<br />Or you&#039;ll just binge when your are done with the amphetamines and it will come back on FAST.<br />The objective is accually to create healthy eating habits that once you have lowered your bodyfat percentage you keep applying to your lifestyle so you can continue lowering them if necessary or mainting the percentage you have achieved.<br />Only create deficiancy through exercise.Cardio AND weights to stimulate your body not to burn them since you accually use them:).<br /><br /><br />-Keep your proteins up.<br />I highly reccomend making milkshakes out of cottage cheese.<br />**cottage cheese+berries+sweetner (artificial or stevia)+water <br />**cottage cheese+peanut butter+cacao powder+sweeter<br />You can make it yummy with ALL sorts things.<br />And in case you experience lack of appetite from the amphetamines you&#039;ll down this with no problem.<br />**I also reccomend adding sufficient fibers to at least one shake if you are having multiple.<br /><br />-DO NOT cut fats out of your diet.<br />Your body needs them and calculate them into your diet.<br /><br />Before you go to sleep make a vegetable smoothie(google for some recipes)<br />I like adding letuce to it as it contains a natural sedative:)).<br />And the magnesium from other veggies or sources should help with amph tolerance:).

				Yes it helps greatly, keep dosages low!<br /><br />but you might try to get a prescription for dex, adderell instead since dosages are much easier to control and you&#039;ll loose apatite on all amphetamines.

				yes , not only will it&nbsp; keep you from getting hungy ,it will seriously speed up your metabolism also. Very effective and if you never had any prior experience with it , it would work with pretty small doses- beware it in this drug&#039;s nature&nbsp; for dosages to increase . And if you dont stay on long enough , u will gain the weight back and more.

				what&#039;s the deal with putting weight back on - how do you avoid that?&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that just because appetite can come back so if you&#039;re careful and stick to low carb foods you&#039;ll be ok?&nbsp; Can you put on muscle mass while using meth?&nbsp; Even in low amounts say 20 - 30mgs in a day while working out / running etc?<br /><br />Yes you need fats if anything to avoid a heart attack - fats are the engine oil of the body and you will get sick of die without them.&nbsp; Low fat diets are total BS. It&#039;s carbs, especially sugar, that makes you fat.

				Yes it&#039;s possible but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. I&#039;ve never done meth myself but from what I gather it isn&#039;t safe to use daily.

				If your goal is weight loss, i&#039;d recommend having a leg amputated over getting a crystal meth habit. It will cause significant weight loss without much risk of addiction, and the only side effect is being unable to walk again - which is not that bad compared to those of meth addiction. <br /><br />Kidding aside though, there are some stimulants that actually do help with weight loss. While now banned in most countries, the &#039;stackers&#039; used to be very succesful. Basically they contain ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin. Ephedrine is the chief active ingredient in them, but also a precursor for the synthesis of meth, which is the main reason it got banned. <br /><br />This does not mean the original stacker formula is now ineffective though, it&#039;s just a matter of getting your hands on the ingredients. Caffeine and aspirin are widely available, ephedrine is something you&#039;d probably have to source from SR nowadays. <br /><br />While effective for weight loss, some serious complications have been noted with these stackers: There have been a few suspected deaths as a result of them, but they can also trigger anxiety attacks and such if you are prone to them. Also, they are not to be used if you suffer from a condition like elevated blood pressure or heart damage.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommended it either. Sure, you&#039;ll lose weight but once you stop (if you can) you&#039;ll simply put it all back on again.<br />Stop taking short cuts, get to the gym and exercise. You&#039;ll feel so much better for it in the end.<br /><br />LSDLucidity.

				Um, what if you work out hard while using a MODEST amount of meth, during the day, orally only (not snort / vape) and when you stop for a bit, don&#039;t binge out on food and stick to a paleo or healthy type diet low in carbs and still going in with weight training?
