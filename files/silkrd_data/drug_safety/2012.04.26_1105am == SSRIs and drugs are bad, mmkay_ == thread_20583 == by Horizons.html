				Hello, everybody! I&#039;m here to deliver a quick PSA in response to some threads I&#039;ve seen lately.<br /><br />DO NOT DO CONSCIOUSNESS-ALTERING DRUGS WHILE ON SSRI MEDICATION!<br /><br />This means no psychedelics, no MDMA, and no heroic doses of dissociatives. Why? Because YOU WILL FUCKING DIE.<br /><br />SSRIs are trip-blockers. They greatly lower the potency of any mind-altering substance you consume while on them. Some people notice this, and decide that the solution is to take more drugs. But, kids, more drugs are never the solution (mmkay?). The goal of an SSRI is to make the availability of serotonin in your body higher, by inhibiting its reuptake (hence the name Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). Psychedelics and MDMA work by making your serotonin receptors extra-sensitive, and dissociatives put your whole fucking brain in overdrive. Both result in your head being flooded with more serotonin than it could handle.<br /><br />What&#039;s wrong with too much serotonin? Well, it turns out you can OD on serotonin. And it&#039;s extremely easy to do so. If you&#039;re on an SSRI, and then take twice your normal dose of whatever drug tickles your fancy, you&#039;ll be putting your serotonin levels at close-to-toxic levels. This can lead to some pretty bad shit. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Wikipedia</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mild symptoms may only consist of increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils, myoclonus (intermittent tremor or twitching), as well as overresponsive reflexes.[1] Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, high blood pressure and hyperthermia; a temperature as high as 40 째C (104 째F) is common in moderate intoxication. The overactive reflexes and clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hypervigilance and agitation.[1] Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 째C (106.0 째F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you are on SSRI medication and wish to do a psychedelic or MDMA, you will require some foreplanning. Take a week or two to slowly phase out your SSRIs (stopping instantly will usually give you brain zaps, which I can tell you are not very pleasant) until you completely stop the day before tripping (meaning that your last actual medication was two days before). You may resume your SSRI treatment two days after tripping. Work up to your usual dose over a few days, as well.<br /><br />Trip safe, live long!<br /><br />Good vibes,<br />Horizons.

				I had this happen while on Paxil as a teenager. <br /><br /><br />Never. Again. <br />Obviously, I didn&#039;t die, but I wanted to.<br /><br />I had no clue it could happen so I wasn&#039;t just freaking out, but I read about it afterwards and I think I was pretty close to going to the ER.<br />I agree about stickying this. Or at least something that reminds people to do research before they take drugs while on other medicines.<br />

				In absolute terms, statistically SSRIs, anti-depressants and common OTC drugs like paracetamol and aspirin kill more people than all illegal drugs combined. <br /><br />This doesn&#039;t suddenly mean coke, h, meth are ice-cream and apple pie, obviously in relative terms far fewer people take powerful illegal drugs but it is still food for thought.<br /><br />Actually read the damn fine print on your prescription. Statistically speaking, if I picked a random person out of the population, he or she is more likely to die from a overdose of aspirin than cocaine.<br /><br />People who &#039;know-it-all&#039;, who are overly confident, or people who don&#039;t use google or wikipedia, these two groups represent 9/10 of people on the toxicology slab.

				Mirtazapine/Remerol seems to be the best anti-depressant to use when using recreational drugs and I&#039;ve found it to be a lot more effective then SSRI&#039;s for my anxiety, insomnia and depression. I have seen reports of it dulling the effects of certain drugs but from what I&#039;ve researched it seems pretty safe, even with certain RC&#039;s. Keep in mind I have no medical background this is just what I found from my research.

				There was a VERY informative thread on Bluelight that had a list of many different medications and what effects they have on different types of recreational drugs. I wish I could find that thread again.<br /><br />I was on SSRIs for 3-4 years. MDMA did nothing, cocaine had very minimal effects, but I didn&#039;t notice any change in my psychedelic experiences. I think I remember reading that it varies from person to person what effects SSRIs have on psychedelics. My only gripe was not being able to try ayahuasca because SSRI + MAOI is a sure fire way to get serotonin syndrome.

				depends what SSRI the subject is taking<br />they all have different effects on different drugs.<br />I&#039;m no expert but did alot of research on this.<br />MAOIs pose the most threat of causing seratonin sysndrome, not SSRIs per se<br /><br />I can say for a fact the Zoloft will block all effects of MDMA for most people including myself.<br />it has no effect on DMT though<br /><br />the bluelight link above is a great start if you want to learn more.<br /><br />currently I am going through W/D from Zoloft<br />decided last week to quit. my last doc visit he uped my dose after explaining that I wanted to stop taking it.<br />my dumbass went cold turkey last week and it hit me yesterday<br />shaking<br />nervousness<br />headache<br />anxiety attacks<br />weird feeling in my arms...<br />so went back to regular dose and will start tapering until I see doc next week and demand he ween me off<br /><br />dont feel good today but not as near as bad as yesterday<br />
