				So, small problem has been popping up, recently. While I&#039;ve smoked many different things out of base pipes without any issues, smoking heroin in the base pipes (I know this is unusual, and people usually use tin foil, but I prefer the pipe regardless) is causing the pipe to heat up to the point that it burns my lips. My hand doesn&#039;t feel like the pipe is hot at all, but it really hurts my lips.<br /><br />I presume somebody has run into this problem before. What&#039;s the best way to fix this? Should I get thinner glass at the bulb? Get a longer one? Somehow get a non-conducting mouthpiece for it?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking thinner and longer is really the best option, but I&#039;d like to see if somebody else has encountered this problem before, or see if anybody has any even better ideas.

				I used to put a small length of proper diameter PVC tubing (from lowes/home depot) over the end of my metal stem when I smoked freebase coke (notice the white guy avoidance of the term crack)

I&#039;d be somewhat concerned that the plastic would be giving off noxious fumes or something. But that indeed would solve that problem...

				Nope I&#039;d use a brass or whatever it was barbed fitting with threaded on the other end, chore boy in the threaded part (there was a little lip that kept you from sucking chore boy in) and tubing on barbed part.&nbsp; To get resin I&#039;d take tubing off (only like 2-3&quot;)&nbsp; and put in freezer, after a few minutes I&#039;d take tubing and bend it a few times, shit would fall right out on plate.&nbsp; <br /><br />I need to stop, starting to jones for some good crack, err I mean freebase cocaine

Might have to head on up to Lowes or something to grab one of those. I&#039;ll just bring my nice flower holder in with me, haha.<br /><br />And it&#039;s pretty difficult to stop IMO. I only stopped because I found heroin, though I&#039;m trying to taper that down, too. =P
