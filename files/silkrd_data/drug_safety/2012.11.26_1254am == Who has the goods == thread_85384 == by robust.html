				When I say goods I mean the product that legands are made of<br />Ive gotten ecstacy 3 times off SR and they were al duds, from vendors with good records also<br />Ive had ecstacy that made me a fan for life, but the e on this site aint it<br /><br />ive also had the ketamin from one good vendor,&nbsp; i never done k before so nothing to compare it tooo<br /><br />was weird, was odd, snorted 250mgs..........but what i experienced is not anything you would wantt to do at a rave or anything like that(it is an old school rave drug) so im left wondering if maybe the ketamine i got was something else<br /><br />whats the word yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

				When you bought E did you make sure to buy from a trusted vendor selling PURE MDMA (Molly) or did you just buy something listed as Ecstasy?

				I ask only because I can&#039;t imagine the best selling listing -- which is a gram of MDMA from UnderGroundSyndicate who has a score of 100 -- being a dud. I&#039;ve never bought E from SR, but I plan on doing so someday, so I wanna make sure you&#039;re buying the right shit before I decide not to.

				what pills have you done before?<br /><br />what pills have you gotten from SR and who were the vendors?<br /><br />how did the ketamine make you feel?<br /><br />how often do you roll?<br /><br />your post is really vague so it&#039;s hard to troubleshoot your problem...i started raving about 14 years ago so i was around when ketamine was good and pills were legendary...

				This post shouldn&#039;t even be here, it should be in the Rumor mill. But yeah, I agree, you have to be more specific. You&#039;re basically claiming to know that every reputable E vendor on SR has bunk shit, and I highly doubt that&#039;s the case.

				I got a gram MDMA crystal from Symbiosis about a month ago and it was good stuff, shame he&#039;s either stopped or is selling private now. For what it&#039;s worth I recommend him anyway.

				how much MDMA were you taking? there are a few dutch vendors who sell pressed pills...who did you get yours from?<br /><br />as mentioned above K in small doses is better for partying...the K-hole is more of a meditative place where you disconnect from the physical world and only your mind exists...the K-hole is more of an introspective place...<br /><br />raves were a different place 14 years ago...they weren&#039;t very crowded...you could find a nice dark corner to K-hole and just trip out...back then people were true psychonauts and sought to reach ego death and expand their metaphysical selves...<br /><br />K in small doses provides a nice mood boost and a relaxed muscular feeling...which is quite nice when you&#039;re rolling or frying...

				furthermore both the R and S isomers of MDMA by themselves are not as euphoric as the racemate...

				umm the MDMA&nbsp; got from Germany was brownish powder, which didnt do the trick<br />the ecstacy I got from Amsterdam were blue pills......nada<br /><br />I dont do e very often, not in 5 years before SR came around. Since then those 2 MDMA/ecstacy attempts were about 6 mounths apart<br /><br />and these vendors were reputable too<br /><br />do all the super bomb stuff get gobbled up IRL and SR gets the stuff that wouldnt sell at a party or on the street?
