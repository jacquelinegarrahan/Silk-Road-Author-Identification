				I would think its because the sources you could get meph from were legit- thus&nbsp; the product was laboratory grade chems. Now the sources are maybe a bit more shady. Shady buisnesses do shady things sometimes like cut product , or cut corners in production.

As I said before, I&#039;m not sure the specific reason why actual pre-ban products are more potent.<br /><br />Maybe you can enlighten us on this seeing as you seem quite intelligent when it comes to the making of drugs as I&#039;ve previously read elsewhere on the forums that you will be supposedly releasing your own ketamine :)

				You are correct, the K is getting done as we type haha. However I am not a chemist and I don&#039;t pretend to be one, I just know bits that I pick up from the people I work with. <br /><br />Anyway it is certainly not impossible to get pre-ban quality, far from it. The batches we are doing now will all be Indian-Rice crystal. There are a lot of reasons why it&#039;s been so hard to get pre-ban and they range from fake product, cutting or not getting the right isomers/racemic mixture. <br /><br />

This made the mephedrone more toxic but by not washing the pre-cursors out but it was more potent this way. I noticed the pre ban drone left your mouth chewed up &amp; tongue blistered from being toxic. The drone I&#039;ve tried so far this year has been more clean &amp; not as toxic but also more mild in potency. I&#039;ve heard this is because it&#039;s more Indian manufactured now &amp; their wanting to synth the product the right way &amp; for it to be more clean.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />So with that being said, it also came down to how well a chemist made their product period! Same as any other drug. <br />Anyone else agree?.&nbsp;
