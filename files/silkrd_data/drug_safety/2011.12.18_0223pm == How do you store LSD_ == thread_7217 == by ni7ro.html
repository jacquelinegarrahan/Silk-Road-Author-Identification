				Hi, I have a question for you all (especially for silk road LSD vendors )<br />How do you store LSD blotters and how do you protect them from air heat and light?

				Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; How long does blotter LSD last? Is wrapping it in foil and putting it in the freezer a reasonable storage method?<br />A:&nbsp; &nbsp; The primary catalysts for the decomposition of LSD are heat, light, oxygen, and moisture. LSD&#039;s shelf life can be significantly extended if exposure to these are minimized.<br /><br />Air &amp; Light<br />Keeping LSD in an air and light proof container is the most important step. A good option is a dark amber glass container kept somewhere cool. Remember, most plastic (plastic bags) is not air tight, though it&#039;s a lot better than nothing. Likewise, keeping blotter in foil isn&#039;t going to stop air transfer, but it&#039;s also better than nothing. If glass isn&#039;t available, a combination of foil and plastic would be more effective than either one alone.<br /><br />Temperature<br />LSD will degrade even at room temperature, but the hotter the temperature and the longer it is stored in a hot location, the more it will degrade. At room temperature, degredation is quite slow, so a cool room, out of the sun is generally enough to minimize break-down. Storing blotter in the refrigerator or freezer is fine, but is probably unnecessary.<br /><br />Moisture<br />If blotter is stored somewhere cold (as opposed to cool), it should be allowed to return to room temperature before being opened as this will prevent condensation from forming. Also, if the weather is extremely humid, storing LSD with a little bit of dessicant (drying agent), can ensure that it stays dry.<br /><br />If these storage methods are followed, blotter should last for many years. Foil in the freezer is a common storage method, and should be effective at keeping degradation to a minimumfor a few years.<br />

				Wrap in plastic wrap, then in tin foil then in a empty aspirin-like tube.<br />Those tubes are good because they have a humidity absorber on the cap and are quite air tight... Perfect for storing strips !

				...having said that there&#039;s been one kept in a mini plastic thingy...perhaps not 100% air-tight, lost all potency after +- 3yrs...i couldn&#039;t understand why at the time as assumed it would keep for yrs...?!<br /><br />&nbsp; ::)

				Good tips so far, I&#039;ll chip in that a widely available desiccant is the silica gel packs in just about every electronics package, new shoes, etc etc. Throw one of those in your stash box and you shouldn&#039;t worry about condensation.

				- i think the desiccant / silica gel packs should be used if keeping sealed trips in the fridge due to the moisture...?!<br />- otherwise interesting views.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br />

				Why keep LSD for years while it&#039;s losing potency? Between local supplies and SR there should almost always be availability. Buy it, store it in your mouth and your friends, then buy some more to likewise store. ;)

				- mine were &quot;lost&quot;....<br />- someone may want to store them cos they were fucking good or simply sentimental reasons.<br />- otherwise i agree, well there is a supply here...<br /><br />&nbsp;;D
