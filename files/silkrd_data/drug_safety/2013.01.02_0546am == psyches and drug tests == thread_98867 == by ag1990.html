				Im a recreational psychedelic user, if i do partake its only on a friday night. <br /><br /><br />I have to take random drug tests, not legal troubles, but for my job. First job ive ever had that said they do randoms an actually do it. <br /><br />I have partaken in many different drugs, until i gotten on here i thought i had tried most of them and i was wrong there some stuff i didnt even know existed.<br /><br />My job does a simple piss test.<br /><br />The reason i mainly do pysches is there only ones to have value (in my opinion) besides weed, but because weed attaches to your fat cells thats out of the question.<br /><br />i know theres piss clean drinks and while i know that some work. i have no time for preparation. they litterally grab you and 5 mins later your peeing in a cup. if your on the clock your susceptable to a test.<br /><br />So as far as i know shrooms take abou 8hrs to leave you system, i maybe wrong?<br /><br />what are the psyches times to leave your system. <br /><br />I know its based off of body weight some times<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				Someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;m fairly certain lsd doesn&#039;t appear on urine tests. They can test for it, but it costs quite a bit and is only done when it&#039;s suspected to be at play in some sort of fatal accident.
