				Hey All,<br /><br />I have never done LSD before and have been given 2 tabs for free from a mate of mine.<br /><br />He tells me they take 2-3 hours to kick in. Is this normal?<br /><br />I would like to give it a go but am concerned the trip will go for longer then I would like. This is the feedback I have received from other mates that have done it.<br /><br />Are there any other things (like Benzos) that will stop a trip in its tracks should it not be going the way I planned? I would like to have an exit plan if that is possible.<br /><br />Does anyone else have any tips for a first timer?<br /><br />As a side note I am very experienced with most other drugs. Coke, Pills, Speed, Meth, K, Benzos etc etc and hold myself together well when wasted. Just thought Id add that so people realize Im not a 14yo with no experience.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Dicko

				It takes roughly 30 minutes to kick in and lasts about 6hr-10hrs depending on dosage. I like to take it in the evening around 7pm so I pass out around 1-2am. Takes 1-2hrs to peak.<br /><br />Start with one tab and take more if you feel like it after an hour or so.<br /><br />Once you take it you won&#039;t be too worried about stopping it since its quite nice, so I wouldn&#039;t bother with the benzos. <br /><br />If you&#039;re in the right settings and headspace (positive mood), it&#039;s a very enjoyable high. Very pleasant. Not like shrooms which can be weird.<br /><br />Take it on your own for the first time and watch movies/listen to music. Or with some close friends you trust and know would be cool. Or better yet with someone else who is doing it.<br /><br />I was scared to take it for the first time but I realized its really safe. Just don&#039;t stress out or put yourself in stressful situations and you&#039;ll be fine.

				2-3 hours sounds like DOx to me, if the tabs have a bitter taste that&#039;s what they are.<br />but if its LSD you should be fine inside or out, just make sure you have something to drink handy, and preferably people you can talk to. just do what feels comfortable to you.

				I recently had my first ever LSD trip thanks to SR.<br /><br />It took just over an hour for it to kick in but it is very subtle, you&#039;ll be trying to figure out if you are coming up or not for a while but once you do there is no missing it.<br />I took mine around 5 in the evening and didn&#039;t go to bed until about 8 in the morning. After the peak around 2 o&#039;clock I spent some hours coming down and didn&#039;t feel tired for quite a while.<br /><br />To my knowledge there is absolutely no way to stop a trip once its started. That&#039;s why people always recommend taking a small amount and waiting to see what its like. <br />I think most drugs will actually make it more intense but I don&#039;t know exactly what benzos would do. It&#039;s best not to even think that way, most of an LSD trip comes from your setting and mind set. I did it at home, on my own after a day off. I&#039;m very comfortable being on my own in my house so I set everything up the way I liked it, filled the fridge with drinks and snacks and just relaxed. I knew there would be no problems or suprises so I could relax and enjoy it. The more you think about it possibly going bad the more likely it will. <br /><br />Main thing is, its nothing like TV and movies depict it, most of the bad things you&#039;ve heard are lies and it&#039;s very difficult to describe so even other peoples accounts won&#039;t prepare you for what its like. It&#039;s fun, it can be intense but you&#039;re a lot more in control than you&#039;d imagine...as long as you don&#039;t take a silly amount that is but with 2 tabs you should be fine.<br /><br />Good things to do (depending on your situation) would be; <br />listen to music,<br />draw/paint/play an instrument/create,<br />go outside into nature,<br />play with lights in dark rooms (glow sticks/laser pointers),<br />stare at things (you&#039;ll do a lot of this, more fun than it sounds)

				As mentioned above, don&#039;t worry too much about acid. It&#039;s really quite forgiving (short of Shai&#039;s epic dosages of course). Just be in a good place (inside and out) with lots of stimulation: music, walks amongst trees, nature documentaries, and so on.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Or better yet with someone else who is doing it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>+1.

I think you&#039;ll need to take a noticeably strong second hit, or one closer to your first dose, to experience a stronger trip. My usual advice for first-timers who believe they&#039;re ready for acid is so take around 200mics. A manageable amount (especially with more experienced company on hand) that&#039;ll leave one with a memorable first date with Lucy. Enjoy!

				Here&#039;s the best advice. I&#039;ve had most every kind of psychedelic blotter you can have.<br /><br />Taste them, take one and put it on your tounge, dont worry about any taste unless it last for more than about 10 seconds. If it taste REALLY bitter like crushed up asprin, burnt rubber or lidocain/bile then swallow it immediately and dont take the other. If it taste mildly bitter or has no taste then take the seconds one and swallow them both.<br /><br />If it&#039;s acid it should have no taste, or a mild bitterness. I&#039;ve had real acid that was fairly bitter but the taste faded after about 10 seconds.<br /><br />If it&#039;s DOx then you dont want to take more than one, you can tell because all DOx chemicals are very bitter and taste like rubber. NBOMEs are not active orally and taste like lidocain or bile, they will make your tounge go numb, so if you swallow a tab and have NO effects after 2 and a 1/2 hours then it was an NBOMe.

				Be sure to eat very light on the trip day.&nbsp; Avoid greasy, fatty foods and alcohol.&nbsp; You will be embarking on a purifying journey so travel light.&nbsp; Good stuff should take 30-45 minutes to kick in - not 2 hours.&nbsp; Be ready to be up and going for the next 10-15 hours, depending on the quality.&nbsp; Make sure you are in a good positive mood and a familiar environment.&nbsp;

If you feel you aren&#039;t tripping just sit in one place, don&#039;t talk and stare off into the distance at a fixed point. Or just close your eyes and listen to some music.<br />If you&#039;re having a bad time just remember it is only a drug and it is only temporary. Talk to an experienced friend you trust who is sober and you&#039;ll feel reassured. Take deep breathes and just chill. You&#039;ll be fine, bad trips are rare.<br /><br />IMHO it&#039;s best to go camping with your bros when it is going to be a full moon night. Please make sure there is one person who has done LSD before who will be sober during your trip. Play some Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Beatles on a good speaker. Take some nice chilled beer with you. Make sure you have a good view of the setting sun. Drop some LSD around 4 hours before sunset and just chill out with your bros. This way you will experience a visual day trip and a mind warping dark trip. Both are awesome. You should maybe buy some more acid so 2-3 of your bros can do it with you.<br />Make sure you have a good pair of sunglasses with you but avoid staring at the sun directly. It seems obvious but it&#039;s really tempting to do that during the trip.<br /><br />Pretrip advice:<br />Sleep well. This is very important.<br />Don&#039;t eat too much and avoid fatty foods and carbs. Stick with a little protein.<br />Make sure you are in a good place mentally and all your mates are also in a good place.<br />Roll a few joints because rolling while you&#039;re tripping is really hard.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />Have fun and enjoy this magical drug!

				2-3 hours to kick in is normal<br /><br />i&#039;ve tripped up to 12 hours on lsd...<br /><br />only thing that&#039;ll really stop an lsd trip is thorazine....but that&#039;s like tying a reality noose around the neck of your mind and kicking the psychedelic chair out from under it...<br /><br />tips for a first timer....stay in a familiar place with people you trust...have some really good music ready...

				Forget about your past experience with other drugs, LSD is something special&nbsp; ;).<br />If you aren&#039;t well balanced mentally and psychologically and/or you go through tough times in your life, it&#039;s not recommended as the drug will intensify your deep feelings.<br /><br />Before trip - sleep well, eat well, and get yourself free time, a whole day if you can. You don&#039;t wanna work or do anything which requires concentration and sobriety, after a good trip.<br /><br />During trip - choose a quiet place to be while tripping. My suggestion is going out to a walk in the nature, but if you live in urban place and your house is quiet enough, you can stay at home. If you feel a little bit anxious or terrified, smoke a cigarette, drink water and most important, sit down and hear some good relaxing music to clear your head from bad thoughts. While you&#039;re tripping you start appreciate the power which music gives you. If you wanna intensify your trip smoke some weed. I heard that Clonex (Clonazepam) can lower your trip completely, though I&#039;ve never tried. If your sitter talks too much and you get into bad thinking loops tell him immediately to shut up and hear good relaxing music.<br /><br />After trip - eat well, sleep well and wake up with a big smile on your face and with satisfaction.<br /><br /><br /><br />Happy Tripping&nbsp; :D<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace

				It does take at least 2 hours to fully peak, I duno man acid is awesome I just wouldn&#039;t worry about it, if they are good tabs take just one. Acid gradually wears off but the peak isnt tooo long. Its a great fuckin drug man, I suppose benzos wouldnt be bad to have around as peace of mind if you need that, but you probably won&#039;t actually need them. Maybe to sleep afterward that would be a good call. Enjoy.

My first trip was ~450ug (I tend to over do things, not a dosage recommendation) and it was pure magic from start to finish, best night of my life. <br /><br />The important thing, I think, is to relax and not build up the experience in your mind too much.

				I&#039;ve never bothered, but if you are scared of having a bad trip, it&#039;s a good idea to keep benzos handy. They can help you get out of it. However, I would recommend to go along with it, because every trip is an important experience, good or bad, as far as I&#039;m concerned.
