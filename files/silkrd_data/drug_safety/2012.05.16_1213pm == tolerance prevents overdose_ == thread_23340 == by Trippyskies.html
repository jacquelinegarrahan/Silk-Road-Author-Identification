				so...&nbsp; I took some noms last night (25i),&nbsp; and then today, when I was haning out drinking with friends, I kicked them some tabs and tookthree timss as much as I did yesterday, and nothing.&nbsp; I got nothing. almost no effect what so ever. (ok, whatever, I got the tiniest visuals and a teeny mind change)<br /><br />Now, my question is, what would have happened if I would have taken a dose that should have OD&#039;;ed me?&nbsp; would it have even done anything?<br /><br />Actually, a better question is &quot;HOW CAN I FRY MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK WITH STRONG EFFECTS?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that sounds reckless, but really, I would love to be able to fry several times a week. intense visuals are key, the main key

				you can&#039;t<br />if its anything like LSD you would need to like 10x your dose just to feel the same as you did on the lower dose the day before.<br /><br />your better off waiting a week between trips.. and constistant use of RC&#039;s should be avoided.. the long term effects are not known.. and over doing it like that is obviously not a good thing to do..<br /><br />that being said, its your body and do as you please. Its just not the smartest idea to try to get fucked up multiple times a week ... either on LSD or some RC....

				Yeah, I agree with opi, maybe you might want to buy some DMT and blast to hyperspace, between 25i trips <br />

				You can find a chart of the needed dose here: www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/479297-The-Big-amp-Dandy-LSD-amp-Shroom-Tolerance-FAQ-and-Discussion-Thread<br /><br />That chart is for LSD/shrooms but I found it&#039;s accurate for 25I. Actually, since 25I has a higher affinity to 5-HT2 receptors than LSD, it&#039;ll cause more tolerance and stick around for longer.<br /><br />Tripping multiple times a week (especially on an RC) isn&#039;t advisable... however after 4-7 days your tolerance should be back to decent levels.

				1) NBOMe compounds have a ridiculously high tolerance. For most, it takes 10-14 days to return to baseline. Additionally, much like LSD, you need a ridiculously high dose to even come close to the first experience. Wait 2 weeks (or more!) for NBOMes.<br />2) Tolerance does NOT prevent overdoses. It only means that you will experience less of the good effects. (This is basically a universal rule... please be careful!) Had you been paying attention, you would have been experiencing a lot of vasoconstriction. If you took too much trying to get to a strong trip again, you could have died. NBOMes are very vasoconstrictive and irresponsible behavior like that could kill you and make these great compounds get emergency scheduled... please be considerate not only to your own health but to others who want NBOMes to remain unscheduled.

				oH, i didn&#039;t take a heroic dose, I should have been clear, it was actually 2 1/2 tabs, I forgot I cut one in half and gave a friend 1.5 tabs.&nbsp; So I had 1.25mg, about half the maximum dose recommended dose.<br /><br />I did spend some time reading about some RC deaths.&nbsp; My fav ppart was the naked guy who&#039;s last words were &quot;I DONT WANT TO DIE! THIS IS STUPID!&quot;&nbsp; That must be an awful way to die.<br /><br />I have taken mushrooms multiple times a week, I really preferred the &quot;groove&quot; I would get into by the third time,&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t feel like a low dose of mushrooms, it feels totally different, like it&#039;s a whole different drug.<br /><br />I guess I have to wait a week.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll do it every &quot;friday&quot; (&quot;Thank god it&#039;s FRYDAY&quot;)&nbsp; I really should have researched more on the tolerance before wasting 3$ last night.&nbsp; &nbsp;Live and learn, right?

				I&#039;m probably done with the 25i after my bag is gone, unless of course taking a larger dose is more intense the next time I take it.<br /><br />i&#039;m not really into being social on fry, I like to wonder around alone, or watch TV/movies.<br /><br />i&#039;ll hav eto look into the &quot;mind food&quot;&nbsp; and see how it works with me.

Please be careful.<br />Psychedelic tolerance is usually caused by downregulation of the 5-HT2 receptors (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21191.msg217601#msg217601). This means that you&#039;ll feel less of the effects caused by the 5-HT2 receptors, but the other effects will be the same (ok, it&#039;s possible to build a tolerance to those too but it takes more time). This usually means more side effects (vasoconstriction, faste heart rate, overstimulation and so on).

				Thanks mixer, you put that in a simple way that i can understand.<br /><br />I was kind of high when I thought about it.&nbsp; In hindsight the doses did effect me a little bit.&nbsp; the crazy shit people think of when they are high, eh?&nbsp;
