				Hey, sorry if this is a stupid question, but I see a lot of posts and interest about Methadone on this forum and around the internet.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done my fair share of opiates, but I&#039;ve never had any kind of strong physical dependence, mostly due to careful dosing (I learnt quickly a long time ago that even just a few days in a row can give me days where I want to do nothing more than lay in bed with my eyes closed).<br /><br />I thought the only reason to do Methadone was to get rid of the withdrawal symptoms and to block the euphoria from other shorter lived opiates? I also thought that methadone was widely condoned by most governments and pretty easy to buy at a methadone clinic (sorry if this is naive, I have no idea).<br /><br />Can someone help me understand the appeal of street methadone? Why you take it/why you buy it?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-curious

				Well, methadone is an opiate and has morphine alike effects. That include a euphoria also. His long acting properties are suitable for an addicts to be at peace from opiate withdraw.<br />There were many conversations how much methadone is really euphoric. That is very subjective issue, better to say - individual question.<br />It does not block euphoria - its a strong opiate and because of that, users can not feel weaker opiate, logical answer.<br />I can draw a parrarel to that; if I use methamphetamine today and later some amphetamine - i would not feel much of amph, will I? Something like this is the same for methadone.<br />For certain; many people like effects/euphoria from it. Others factors in all that is that is supplied in tablet forms what prevent many to I.V. it.<br />Its very difficult to explain many asspect to someone who never try it. Like with all opiates, if is used all the times, tolerance kick in and effects are felt less and less.<br />Other properties and fact about difficulty to withdraw are published in many places so I will not get into.<br /><br />It can be a good recreational drug, but not to take it all the time and to control tolerance. That way user can take some other opiate no matter which and feel good from all.

				Methadone is a weird animal. it has a very long half life. but a fairly short analgesic half life. Meaning that 10mg will take away the pain for 4 hours or so but the other effects, like the effects on breathing is much longer. this is why many people od on methadone. they take their daily dose and 6 hours later they are again in pain so they take more.<br /><br />The Germans came up with methadone during WWII when they had a shortage of morphine, they came up with methadone.&nbsp; Its a great pain killer and very euphoric. When you take it every day and take 50-100mg of of it daily, your receptors are pretty much slammed. You either have to&nbsp; break through the methadone (which is VERY dangerous) or lower your tolerance.<br /><br />I have found if you lower your tolerance to about 40mg or lower on a daily basis, it doesn&#039;t take much to break through it. but dont try if you are not experienced..<br /><br />But to think of methadone as just a opiate blocker is incorrect. It has a lot of great recreational value. but you must be VERY careful with it. The greatest thing about methadone is that I can go about 2-3 days inbeeween opiate doses before WD will set in. So if you are physically addicted to opiates, I would get some of mselllers stuff and and mix about 30mg of into juice and drink it. Wait a couple hours and if you are still in wd, take another 10mg, but I wouldnt take more than 60mg unless&nbsp; &nbsp;you have one hell of a monster H tolerance..<br /><br />Methadone is not your average opiate... its something that if your not familiar with that you need to do some studying and figure out what is right for you...

				I would like just to say something about my product when taking oral.<br />Its best if you fill a gelatine capsule with particular dosage with methadone powder and drink it.<br />Inactive substances in tablet are not only used as a filler, there are meant to &quot;trap&quot; tablet in stomach where can kick in pretty fast (dont confuse that with instant or extended release).<br />With methadone dissolved in solution can feel weaker. It can go straight to bladder and some amount can bypass receptors or can start to kick delayed.
