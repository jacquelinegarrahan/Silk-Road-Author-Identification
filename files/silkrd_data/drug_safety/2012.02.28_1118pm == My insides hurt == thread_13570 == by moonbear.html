				I&#039;ve been doing a lot of MXE lately. It&#039;s started to last longer and take a longer time before it kicks in too. I&#039;ve been using it for antidepression, and it takes a lot &#039;cause my life is pretty damn depressing. When I pee it&#039;s like razor blades coming out my dick. Help me!

And so my obsession with psychoactive substances began! Bit stupid, really.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>yeah now that you mention it when I was youth I was caught selling herb in HS (long story, but bottomline I think this kid a year younger than me set me up) and was suspended for two weeks and almost expelled, but if i&#039;d had SR back then who knows what the fuck i&#039;d been selling! lol! that whole event could&#039;ve had very serious implications&nbsp; :o<br /><br />But yeah HS was sooo tight! I could pretty much get anything in the day (except this odball shit like rc&#039;s and NBombs and whatnot) First time I took X i was 15 too. My girlfriend was 18 and JUST moved into this new apartment and then the blackout happened(remeber that when the east coast was out of power for like a week?!)..we threw this badass E party! it was probabaly the weekend of my life. lol!<br />I also liked my painkillers and cokain in HS too. I HATED shrooms though - they always make feel like a piece of shit afterwards - so I was always too afraid to try lsd until just a couple years ago. Now it&#039;s my favorite drug..funny figuring I can&#039;t source it anymore&nbsp; &nbsp;hence why I&#039;m here...thanks SR&nbsp; 8)

				Not cool. Don&#039;t give out my address. Think how you&#039;d feel if you were set up like that... <br /><br />Anyway this post is only slightly exaggerated. I checked my vitals today - my OBL (oxygen blood level) dropped from 100% to 96%. I don&#039;t smoke cigs. My average heart rate went from around 90 to around 110. 110 is a HORRIBLE heart rate! I work out, and am in very good physical condition on the outside. But on the inside I&#039;m not. This is all from 500mg of MXE (Yes, that&#039;s all I used!) I used about 100mg daily for 5 days. All I can say is, watch out for this dangerous chem.

				Holy shit moonbear, seriously.<br /><br />Assuming you&#039;re a troll won&#039;t be very productive, so I&#039;ll assume you aren&#039;t and tell you how to fix your problem.<br /><br /><br />First, MXE is addictive. Everything that feels good is addictive, that&#039;s just human nature. You need self-control, especially with easy highs.<br /><br />Second, too much MXE will fuck your kidneys - IRREVERSIBLY. That means you&#039;ll have to spend the rest of your life pissing through a plastic tube. You may have some small lesions already, which may or may not be the reason why your piss is cutting up your dick from the inside.<br /><br />Third, if you want the symptoms to go away, eliminate the cause: stop doing MXE for at least a month, and when/if you go back, do smaller doses less often.<br /><br />Fourth, how many people did you spam with that &quot;why do you hate me&quot; message? Finding out that you sent it to wowzers too made me feel cheated on. :( You dirty lying whore.

Small lesions might even heal with time - the problem is allowing them to progress. If you stop now, you should be fine after a few weeks. But I&#039;m just some dude on the Internet. If you&#039;re really worried, you should see a doctor.<br /><br />Just FYI, since I know you&#039;re gonna replace MXE with something else pronto: Ketamine also fucks up your kidneys. In fact, it&#039;s apparently even worse than MXE in that respect.

I did an incremented dose of 200mg three days ago and the afterglow is great. I did DMT on it, and had a really good time with a friend. Honestly, I just put down a bong of some really potent ganja, Im having a great time now :D<br /><br />I did 1.1 grams of it, doing somewhere between 50-150mg. I would never do it daily except one binge of three days in a row. Honestly, part of the reason you feel so ill is doing it so many days in a row. When I do a heavy dose, I chill for a few days at least, and I still feel nauseous and can&#039;t eat a lot unless I smoke weed...the only time my bladder really was sore was the three days in a row - you did it 5... but, again, using this chem in a responsible manner is quite possible and rewarding. While I have overindulged, I can and am stepping back for a few days here and there, a week there, every dose. It is rare I will binge (more than 2 days in a row...I rarely do it 2 days in a row anyways..) My back is also a little sore, is this the case for you, Moonbear? I have done a buncha 2cs, that could be it...<br /><br />Anywho, there are a few things I am doing to quell the nausea, joint swelling, discomfort, and what have you. I of course supplement with all the vitamins one would want, eat only if stomach can take it, usually yogurt, and take some ginger or some other extract to help with stomach. I take flax seed for the brain, yoga for the body, and meditate for the mind. Glucosamine was lying around so began taking it for joints :P I just try and stay as healthy as I can. Excercise, diet, etc. Then, when I go hard with chemicals my body can recover better. I try to space my doses out and ruminate on them. I find doing this chem. multiple days in a row takes away the real benefit and insight one can gain. Your body can&#039;t take it, at least mine can&#039;t. I am minorly sore, but my regiment and spacing of doses is helping out i hope :)<br /><br />Seriously man, just chill. A few days, a week, a month off can do a world of good. Doing this thing multiple days in a row can be shitty...I have found a lot of virtue in it. Its helped me sort some things out, ya know?<br /><br />Good luck, soldier

				This is all just my personal opinion. It may be complete bollocks, so please take it with a grain of salt!<br /><br />It&#039;s your PH levels. You have too much acidity in your system.<br /><br />What you need to do is buy some bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and mix it with water. Drink this a couple of times when dosing. Start with a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and go from there working out how much you need for your stomach acid levels to go down. I will tend to have up to a teaspoon of the stuff in a session.<br /><br />Also, you may want to add more vegetables to your diet.<br /><br />I had very bad pains when urinating, but it&#039;s been fixed by drinking bicarbonate of soda.<br /><br />Oh and as well, you may want to have a break and reduce your usage too.<br /><br />I have to ask as well (OP), why do you have a picture of yourself on this forum? It seems incredibly risky to me.

				Sorry culmint, it&#039;s a nice idea and if it works for you then by all means go for it but there&#039;s no basis at all for the &#039;acidity&#039; myth.

				Don&#039;t apologise, if you don&#039;t have much of a science background it&#039;s easy to believe this stuff as it does seem logical. <br /><br />The danger comes from alternative practitioners using the same bad science to push useless and overpriced &#039;medicine&#039; onto desperate and ill people. Like saying that cancer is caused by pH inbalance and so drinking some &#039;pure ion balanced water&#039; or whatever will cure the cancer by &#039;equilibrating&#039; your pH/ions/energy fields.

				This sound exactly like the long term effects of ketamine, which mxe is similar to. The pains will go away but you must stop taking MXE immediately. the drug may numb the pain but when you come off it it&#039;ll be worse. The drug will be damaging stomach if you let it drip down your throat after a line. You&#039;ll also mess up your nose. Use a hot water bottle on any pain and you should feel better in a few days.

				What the fuck? How can that be?<br />Does anyone know the reason for the physical damage?<br />Do you advise not doing MXE and Ketamin at all?<br />I think the side effects overweigh the benefits or what&#039;s the sense of using it then, when other drugs are not so harmful?

				This is the most stupid topic i ve read ever.<br />Go to the doc if something hurt!<br />There are millions of people who have not enough money for the doc and die and you are <br />afraid of saying something to your parents!<br />A lot of people wait to long with the doc and than they die...<br /><br />
