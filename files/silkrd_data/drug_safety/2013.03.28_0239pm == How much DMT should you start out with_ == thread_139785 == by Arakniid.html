Afterwards I had enough spice to breakthrough many more times, and share the experience with a few people.<br /><br />Obviously times are a bit different now since this was when grams were $60, but I think 500mg should be a good amount to start with honestly. You can go with less but you might be underwhelmed if you don&#039;t quite make it to a breakthrough.

				If done efficiently 30mg of quality DMT can be plenty. I&#039;d start with ~35mg. Usually you end up smoking very inefficiently the first few times, so I&#039;d recommend a smaller dose to get the hang of actually smoking it rather than the intensity/otherworldlyness of the drug just so you don&#039;t waste it.&nbsp;
