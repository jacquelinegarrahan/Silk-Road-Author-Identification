				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I will be receiving 350 of FoxyMeows 1000ug 25i-NBOMe blotters tomorrow and I&#039;ve heard of people OD&#039;ing on this stuff (non-lethal but still!) so I want to know how many tabs should I take for a good trip? I have taken a maximum of two blotters at a time and the trip isn&#039;t really anything special. I&#039;ve heard people compare the effects of 25i to LSD but I&#039;ve always imagined LSD to be something very different to what I&#039;ve experienced on two tabs. So, how many tabs can I safely take to get anything similar to LSD?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />The Godfather

				I&#039;ve done quite a lot of 25i. The first time I tried with 2 1mg tabs and that was the most intense I&#039;ve had so far from it and haven&#039;t manged to get that again even with 2 tabs. So now I want to up it a bit and maybe try 3 or 4 if that&#039;s safe(ish)?

				First time i took half a 750ug and got nothing. I swallowed it.

Let me re iterate, when you don&#039;t know what a drink is, and your experiencing your everything for the first time, it&#039;s scary as fuck. Listening to music, my music listener was broken, the sound was all wrong like i broke my brain. Did i mention i lost my memory?<br />I didn&#039;t know what rain was and my brain hurt. Don&#039;t know about the physical stuff, but this shit will get more heavy then you can even imagine. Learn how to take it properly, and start with half a tab in one session... Good luck on your trip junior space cadet, your going to need it.

				When I took the two 1mg tabs at the same time under my tongue I obviously did feel something but im sure it&#039;s not what acid feels like. Can I take 3 or 4 tabs without OD&#039;ing? Has anyone here done 4 or more???

				It seems nobody is understanding my question. I have ALREADY done 25i-NBOMe and the first time I tripped I took two of DudeRugs&#039;s 1000ug blotters. My question is how many 1000ug blotters can i take at the same time safely?

I don&#039;t think you realize what sort of chemical you are fucking with to be honest, it&#039;s not like LSD where you can basically eat 10 tabs and everything will be hunky-dory, you&#039;ll most likely end up in A+E tripping balls and wondering &quot;Why the fuck did I do this? Why must I learn the hard way?&quot;. I mean for fuck sake people are telling you on hear NOT to exceed maybe 2mg and you are still saying &quot;Yeah but would it be ok to do 3-4?&quot;. I remember that you spoke about doing MDMA with your Mrs well if you let her exceed on 25I then you really are a nob because you are basically putting her life on the line. <br /><br />Also you have said in the posts above &quot;I took the two 1mg tabs at the same time under my tongue I obviously did feel something but im sure it&#039;s not what acid feels like.&quot;. Wellll yeahhh...that&#039;s because you aren&#039;t taking LSD....you are taking 25I dumbass. Jesus Christ what kind of silly thing to say is that and what kind of retard compares and does something in the hope it&#039;s like something that they have never even tried in the first place? Especially with something as powerful as 25I-NBOMe. ESPECIALLY AS YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU HAVE SEEN REPORTS ABOUT HOW EASY IT IS TO OD ON IT. <br /><br />I thought Dankology was harsh on you when I saw the thread about MDMA but really, after seeing this you need a smack round the head and a time out because you are like the dumb kid that nobody wants to baby-sit because they deliberately put their fingers in sockets and in the gas fire. You shouldn&#039;t even do drugs if you make threads like this. <br /><br />Sort it out, use your loaf.

				Lol Limetless I am definitely that kid who used to put my fingers in wall plugs haha.. But seriously now - all im asking is what is the safe amount of tabs to take? Im asking before time to avoid anything going wrong and avoid putting mine and my fiancee&#039;s lives at risk. What im basically asking is how many have YOU done? And to find out how many other people have done. Just read a trip report of a guy who did 3 tabs in one night and he says it was amazing so I just wanna know. HOW MANY CAN YOU TAKE SAFELY??????

I did 2mg and I was talking to the bushes in my garden (quite literally) but you have to bare in mind this is a phenethylamine which means that you have to take into account the stimulant effects it will have as well. <br /><br />What I would recommend is getting a pipette bottle and making them into drops because using that method you can measure the dose exactly.

Just stay at 2mg, if you want to go further than just purchase LSD instead. I wouldn&#039;t even compare the two based on my own experiences, LSD is just too unique.

				It&#039;s really not possible to answer your question right now Godfather.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t even clear what a &quot;safe&quot; dose of LSD is.&nbsp; Not even it&#039;s LD50 is known in humans, and millions of dollars have gone into researching the compound over decades! 25i-NBOMe is only a few years old.&nbsp; I would highly recommend you research the dangers of messing around with RCs are - if you have to ask these types of questions, you really aren&#039;t fit to be trying them.&nbsp;

				I ask these questions because I&#039;m curious. I wanted to find out if I could &quot;safely&quot; take more and now that I know, before I tried taking more, now I will not try more! Well thanks guys for your help! I will stay at 2 tabs max to avoid doing anything stupid (although even that may be stupid!!!)

				wow guys.&nbsp; This is why I participate in these forums.<br /><br />I just tried it, 500ug, thought &quot;maybe I&#039;ll do 2.5 next time if research says it&#039;s cool&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />500ug was very light and nice, super smooth come up, It was too light for me, but very lovely.<br /><br />Well, I think I&#039;ll work my way up to it.<br /><br />Shits cheap enough to get 100 hits for personal usage.
