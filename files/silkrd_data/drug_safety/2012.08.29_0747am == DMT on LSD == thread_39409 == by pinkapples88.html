				Ive never heard of&nbsp; the combination but will be ordering both this weekend..What do you guys think? Will it be overwhelming or will it be beautiful and even more enlightening and eye opening than just one or the other? I know they are both different beasts (or beauties) but Id like to hear what you guys think before I go diving into it.It sounds crazy and cool....If not for the fact that I would have to sit still I would even consider a candyflip plus DMT.

				It&#039;s been done before, Terence Mckenna took DMT at the peak of an LSD trip :)<br />He talks about it here: *CLEARNET* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGYa2frO2LM

				I tried this for the fhe first time last night. The visual effect was amazing! I saw the entire forest I was in turn into liquid light and form an ancient temple. <br />When you&#039;re already tripping, the DMT doesn&#039;t have the &quot;blast off&quot; effect it usually does. Its not overwhelming at all. Less so than when you&#039;re in sober state in fact. But the visuals become explosive.

				I&#039;ve done it but only with a very small amount of DMT, mostly because it is so difficult to function and physically do anything. Be careful, both are powerful psychedelics, but if you are definitely familiar with both then it should be fine.

				I smoked some right after my peak and once I came down it really brought down my lsd visuals.&nbsp; I prefer to smoke it at the 6 hour mark as I&#039;m beginning to come down.

				i have tried this, right at a peak of an lsd trip and its not for the faint at heart, seriously this is a mind blowing mixture, i wont be doing it again anytime soon, as far as the acid trip well after you do the dmt and have landed back on earth, the lsd trip feels worthless and although you still feel the effects its nothing like it was before, id keep them separate and enjoy them individually&nbsp;

				Good idea to have it during the comedown, I can definitely see that after you hit the DMT effects from the acid would be a lot less intense. :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard of people having a DMT trip right before an acid trip, and using the acid trip to reflect on and interpret the DMT. That seems like a decent idea.
