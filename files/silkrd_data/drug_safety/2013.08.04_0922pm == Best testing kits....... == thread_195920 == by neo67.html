				Alright folks,<br /><br />Recently required some ecstasy pills and MDMA powder and would like to test these two drugs for MDMA (obviously!) and PMA/PMMA,heard that PMA is nasty stuff and want to stay as far away as possible.<br /><br />What test kits would you recommend? Any in particular? or are they pretty much the same, brand to brand.<br /><br />Ive had a look around the clearnet for decent sites selling ez test kits, on the official site it has them going for £20 but on a unofficial site they have them for sale for £5?! Are they the real deal?--site was eztestkits.com.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks guys.

				A single EZ-test vial (good for 1 test) costs €4 in Holland. I always pick several up when I&#039;m there. So £5 each sounds like the right price to me.<br /><br />Is the £20 version one that has enough for several tests?

				Most of these tests come in the form of single-use packages. You basically add the substance you want to check to the sachet, and wait a bit for a color change.<br /><br />You should know that positives can be false on most of these though, especially when the producers of a drug want it to test positive that is easily done even if their product contains little or no active substance at all.<br /><br />These tests are a pre-screening measure only, and are not reliable enough to serve as evidence in court. Proper analysis is required to determine what substances really are in a sample. and at which concentration. While these quick tests are reasonably good at detecting active substances when trafficking it is very easy to produce and inert substance that will trigger the test but without any activity whatsoever.

				O thanks for the info. Basically i just want to test it for PMA, heard this drug was causing a lot of deaths&nbsp; :( If there was a substance called&nbsp; PMA in there, it would show up on the test right?&nbsp; It says it would on the company website.Would this be&nbsp; an accurate enough reading (if it did contain PMA i would just chuck the whole lot away, not worth the risk)<br /><br />As for MDMA, i have bought it of a reliable vendor who claims it has been lad tested to contain 130mg of MDMA. I trust them as they have good ratings and the oill also appears on a pill review website.
