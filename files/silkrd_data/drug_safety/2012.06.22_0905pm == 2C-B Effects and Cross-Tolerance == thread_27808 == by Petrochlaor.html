				Hey guys,<br /><br />I was just inquiring a matter that&#039;s left me semi-annoyed, but I&#039;m going to try again next week anyway. <br /><br />I recently acquired quite a bit of 2C-B, weighed it into a selection of bombs, and then yesterday I decided to eat a 25mg one, and prepare for a nice trip...<br /><br />But nothing happened. Now the stuff looked legit, as I read it&#039;s a clumpy white powder, check, and it can almost smell a bit &#039;burny&#039;, again, check. <br /><br />I was a bit disappointed, but it struck me that there was a possible cross-tolerance, as two days before I had eaten some shrooms, had an awesome time, but I wondered if because they are both psychedelics, do they effect the same receptors? I know that for example LSD is a serotonergic substance, and I believe shrooms are too, but is 2C-B? I thought at first maybe not due to the different classes (tryptamine and phenethylamine) but then it struck me that it&#039;s possible they act on the same places. <br /><br />If so, will waiting till next tuesday allow my brain to return to relative normality so I can have a brilliant time? <br /><br />Any information/experience would be great!<br /><br />Cheers guys :)

				Read what I wrote here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27795.msg303785#msg303785<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you&#039;d have any tolerance though, I take mushrooms from time to time and find 2C-B isn&#039;t affected by recent previous mushroom use.

				i always assume some cross-tolerance with psychedelics.<br /><br />it is also worth noting that the dosage for HBr is higher than HCl.<br /><br />Personally, I find ~50mg of HBr to be a sweet spot but i also noticed i needed more after taking 2c-i and LSD earlier in the week (i was on vaction!)

				Another thing I forgot to mention is that you kind of have to &quot;bring on&quot; your high. <br /><br />You know if you&#039;re really stressed or busy and take MDMA then you don&#039;t get such euphoric effects from it? Well 2C-B is kind of the same, trippy lights and a generally trippy atmosphere make a massive difference. It&#039;s not a placebo effect, its just you need to point your brain in the right direction or it just doesn&#039;t work. I have this crazy 60&#039;s wallpaper and carpet which really gets me going and then boom that&#039;s it, 4 hours of off my face tripping.<br /><br />&nbsp;Last time I ended up sitting in the bath thinking that the shower head was my cat and stroking it,apparently I kept saying to my partner &quot;the cat&#039;s wet!! the cat&#039;s wet!! how come the cat is wet?&quot; like thousands of times...

				Hmmm<br /><br />It was HCl, not HBr, so I assume my dosage wasn&#039;t the problem...bit strange to hear though, because I don&#039;t know what will trigger it if it that&#039;s the case <br /><br />Not really got much psychedelic stuff at my house, I usually let the drugs do the work :P Shall I take a larger dose? I&#039;m not relatively experienced with LSD, so I&#039;m not exactly too worried about a strong trip.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just try again on Tuesday, it was from a reputable vendor, so I assume the stuff isn&#039;t bunk. Going to be nice when I do finally trip. <br /><br />And who knows about the tolerance, maybe that&#039;s just you? I don&#039;t know all too much about 2C-B but just how you described your experiences in that thread seem far and away from the norm, so could be individual differences. Nonetheless, cheers, hopefully some more info comes in :)<br /><br />Thanks guys
