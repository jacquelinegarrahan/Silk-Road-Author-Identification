				I&#039;ve been reading a lot about how much to dose for the first time trying LSD. Some say 100ug is perfect for the first time, others say that low doses are better for experienced trippers, and that you need a larger dose (250ug+) to get a proper experience.<br /><br />Recommended doses and vendors are appreciated (I&#039;m in the UK)

				First off, if you&#039;re ordering in the next two days, you want JesusofRave. No question at all there. However, he&#039;s closing down after the 24th, but taking &amp; delivering orders until then. If you&#039;re not ordering this quickly, just check out the Avengers thread. They have plenty of good recommendations.<br /><br />As far as dosage, what do you want to get out of the trip? <br /><br />My first dose was reportedly ~200 ug. It was very fun; walls moved to music, grass flowed like water, etc. I did this with my roommate &amp; it was a blast. But I still felt relatively normal &amp; had an almost everyday mental state. We were able to function fairly normally. Went for a few walks around other people, went to a convenience store &amp; bought Orange Juice (which I highly recommend!), &amp; talked to people without them having a clue we were on acid.<br /><br />However, my next dose was 440 ug &amp; I felt like this was my first actual &quot;trip&quot;. I could see music. At one point, one of the guys there had multiple, multicolored faces. When I closed my eyes, I was instantly in another world. This was an entirely different experience all together. Personally, I&#039;d recommend a similar dose for your first time, unless you&#039;ll be in a public setting.<br /><br />The most I&#039;ve done up to this point is ~550 ug. This was also my first solo trip. I can&#039;t put into words what this experience was like honestly. On 440, I felt like I could see music, but on 550 I actually saw it. Music is more than just sound at this dose. It&#039;s a physical being &amp; a story. The closest I can get to describing it-440 was my interpretation of the music. 550 was what the music actually was at its core. The mental space was great-I was the most at ease with the world &amp; myself that I&#039;ve ever been. Unless you&#039;ve done similar substances, I would not suggest starting this high.

				100ug is perfect for your first time. Acid trips are pretty intense. ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve done less than 100ug once and will probably go for 200 or 300 the next time...

				Always start low for a substance you have never tried before. Its just good practice because you don&#039;t know how you will react. Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn&#039;t have a clue what they are talking about. Remember you can always take more drugs, you cant take less.

				100mcg is a great first dose, especially if it&#039;s your first Psychedelic experience. However, if you&#039;re well experienced with intense tripping, I&#039;d probably start with 200. I find that the 300mcg dosage is where things start to get very interesting.<br /><br />LSDLucidity.

				I always, for safeties sake, always recommend taking an allergy test dose of any new substance before jumping right in. This isnt quite as important with LSD as allergic reactions to LSD are extremely rare even based on anecdotal reports and unheard of in medical literature, however its better safe than sorry. Allergy test dose is a lot more important with shrooms or RCs.

				Thanks for the great responses, I think I&#039;m gonna buy a few 100mcg blotters and probably just take one for my first time. <br /><br />I&#039;m a bit uneasy about buying from JoR, as he&#039;s about to disappear there would be no accountability if he didn&#039;t deliver. Or he could have been busted and the police have a made a deal with him where he still operates until the 24th, but discloses buyer&#039;s personal details for a reduced sentence. Maybe that&#039;s a bit farfetched. I might go with HollandOnline, his MDMA pills were awesome, or maybe Haizenberg, seems highly recommended from what I&#039;ve read.<br /><br />Also the LSD Avengers thread is awesome, but so cluttered. It badly needs some formatting to make it easier to read.<br /><br />Thanks again for the replies :D<br />

				100 seems perfect.&nbsp; My first trip was about 250-260ug and I wasn&#039;t ready for it when it took full effect and also couldn&#039;t control it... You should definetly ease into these things.

				Just do it in an environment that you feel comfortable in ! like with really good friends in a place you already know it will make you feel much safer ! <br /><br />try the 100ug and maybe you can pop another after 2/3hours <br /><br /><br />I will always remember my first time it was a life changing experience&nbsp; :D Goodluck friend and keep us updated with a good trip report!
