				I&#039;m interested in psychedelics and hallucinogens, but I don&#039;t want to trip with other people around me.&nbsp; I&#039;m hesitating between LSD, DMT, shrooms or XTC (event though it&#039;s not really a psychedelic).&nbsp; Which one would you recommend me?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done any hallucinogen before, the only drugs I tried were cannabis, booze and Xanax (if we can call that drugs…).&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it too risky?&nbsp; Is it more likely to have bad trips when being alone?

				Well brother, I&#039;d do it like this... i prefer to be alone or with one other person anyways when tripping hard. But you don&#039;t really need to go too deep your first time. When I eat shrooms, I always eat them slowly over a day to a day and half. eat like 2 stems to get your body buzz... then every two hours eat another cap or stem, until you get to where u wanna be. thatway if you do have to be around others at some point, you&#039;re not outta your mind and scared crazy. If you run it like that, you can stay under control and have a really fun time trippin. Go to the park and have fun my friend. I tried LSD before shrooms and enjoyed it alot. However the duration can be a little longer than shrooms and depending on your dose, it could be a little too much for u your first time. DMT will take you to a completely other world, I&#039;d get some experience with hallucinogens first before going there. Also, if you can order some nice organic Morning Glory seeds, LSA is a neat hallucinogen that can be experimented with, but youre gonna need a strong stomach. Happy trip my friend!

				I love doing 2c-i alone and recommend it for anyone that wants to try a psychedelic by themselves. With shrooms/LSD and other stronger psychedelics it can be difficult to trip alone especially if you don&#039;t have a lot of experience. 2c-i is a very gentle psychedelic but no matter which one you end up going for I would recommend having some type of benzo (I personally enjoy xanax) just in case you want to come down a bit.

Gives you a great body high, similar to MDMA (but minus the muscle tension, you might want to stretch, get a massage and/or loosen up before you take it). Great mental space too.

				Out of the drugs you mentioned I think shrooms would be the best.<br /><br />LSD can last for 12 hours. Could be difficult to avoid people for that long.<br /><br />XTC, for me, is a social drug. I took it alone once and spent the entire time feeling great but longing for someone to share the experience with.<br /><br />DMT would be my second choice as I smoke it alone often but I would not recommend it for a first time tripper due to the sheer intensity!<br /><br />My very first psychedelic experience was shrooms taken by myself. I walked through a forest during Autumn and it was one of the most profoundly beautiful experiences I had had at that point in my life. I have been a psychonaut ever since :)<br /><br />So I would say eat .5g of shrooms and go on a nature walk. You can always take more ;)

				Thank you for your answers guys!&nbsp; Now I&#039;m hesitating between 25i-NBOMe and shrooms…&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll go for shrooms, the effects last less long than those of 25i and shrooms are natural :D

				i would def take LSD over 25i<br />LSD first time will be such a revelation, 25i could be experienced as a little more shallow<br />but by all means if u just want to have a taste go with 2cb it&#039;s relatively short lasting and you get that trippy vision

				I only trip alone, mainly because my friends aren&#039;t into psyches (or extra curricular substances in general for that matter.) The few times I have been tripping around other sober people they&#039;ve bought me down and irritated me with their linear thinking and &#039;normal&#039; sense of humor, so I also get a lot more out of it when I&#039;m alone.<br /><br />My only advice is start with a low dose first, no matter what you choose. You should be able to ride out any anxieties on a low dose much better than you can a full on world destroying experience (obviously.)

				You want a good drug for when you&#039;re alone? LSD and MDMA are not good choices. Those are fairly social drugs.<br /><br />You should go with DMT. Your trip will only last about 20 minutes, and it&#039;s super intense. I never have anyone in the room with me when I do it. The first time I tried it my friend was present, and his moving about and talking kept distracting me from my awesome visuals and body high. DMT is a drug you do by yourself, in a dimly lit room. Also, it&#039;s fairly cheap, lots of domestic vendors, and if you want you can easily extract it yourself.<br />

				I find it incredibly hard to have a bad trip on DMT. Never had one actually.<br /><br />Also, remember it only lasts 20 minutes. Better a bad trip on DMT for only 20 minutes, than a bad trip on LSD, DOB, or shrooms for hours on end.

No one is ever ready for DMT lol. I wish I hadn&#039;t waited so long - I guess I was hesitant because everyone was telling me it was so fucking intense. And it is... But not in a scary way.<br /><br />And it&#039;s the only psychadelic that I&#039;m 100% comfortable doing on my own. I&#039;m always worried when getting into high dose trips that I&#039;ll do something stupid on my own (or that I&#039;ll have a bad reaction to some new RC I&#039;m trying). Don&#039;t have that concern with DMT because I wouldn&#039;t be able to do anything stupid if I wanted to, lol. Can&#039;t hurt yourself from the spirit world ;).<br /><br />Never had a bad trip on it either, and the only uncomfortable trips were caused by other people/things happening around me - so in that regard I&#039;d say it&#039;s meant to be done on your own.

				DMT is a very safe option because it occurs in your body anyway, if you are a bit worried/anxious (understandably!) take a low dose to start with. In fact to be honest, it is very harsh so your first few times with DMT you might not be able to break through to the full on experience even if you try. Get 20-30mg, smoke/vape (don&#039;t burn it directly, research techniques first) and you will find colours go crazy, patterns start moving and appearing everywhere, but you probably won&#039;t get any full on hallucinations. Best of all, if you don&#039;t like it, you&#039;re done in 10-20 minutes. If you get close to breakthrough, you may start feeling a bit uncomfortable almost like you are going to feint, don&#039;t try to walk during or directly after!<br /><br />Low amount of LSD would be very close second option for me. ~100ug and you probably won&#039;t even hallucinate. It is quite mild and gentle at low doses, and if the need arises to appear normal around people, its not too hard as long as you don&#039;t have to do much. It will obviously last a lot longer though.<br /><br />Most importantly, as mentioned, start small. Also very important, do loads and loads of research first. The better informed you are the less nervous you will be, and the more relaxed the better the experience.

				I do all my drugs alone. I have only a few trusted friends that I will use psychedelics with but it is a rare event perhaps once a year. <br />Shrooms are a blast on your own. I usually feel nervous about the dose that I&#039;m taking but once they start coming on and I enter the mushroom world I inevitably want to take more.. and usually do. Its funny though how I can forget that place from one trip to the next.<br />Take a small dose at first a gram or so and have a bit of good weed with you to potentiate it. Wait for an hour so that you know what the peak is like and have just a little smoke, not too much.<br />Go outside with some music and lie under the stars. I find that even if the trip is a little intense, the beauty of the stars lifts me to a place that is sublime.<br />A mild shrooms peak is quite short maybe just a couple of hours so you should be fine.

				I&#039;ve always enjoyed dissociatives alone - some of the most powerful experiences I&#039;ve had have been from DXM or ketamine. But it takes a special kind of person to enjoy dissociatives, they&#039;re really a different experience than any other drug I&#039;ve had. <br /><br />I remember one night had chugged about 3 bottles of cough syrup (straight DXM, no acetominophen or anything ) and laid on my bed for hours listening to a Regina Spektor song on repeat and was feeling myself slowly dissociate into the music until my entire world was spinning above me and I phased out of my body and was viewing myself from afar. I was phasing in and out of objects ( television, computer ) and while I&#039;m in those states I can really look objectively at the problems I have in my life and figure things out.<br /><br />That being said I don&#039;t do dissociatives more than once every month or once every few months. Even though most don&#039;t like them it still can have an addicting quality, but dissociatives are really hard on the body so I don&#039;t want to fux with them too much. But if I&#039;m alone and want to do something I&#039;ll usually either dissociate or smoke weed. Occassionally I&#039;ll get drunk alone, but that&#039;s a rarity. I&#039;ve never tried psychedelics alone.<br /><br />Methylone is a pretty good one to do alone, TBH. Just make sure you have facebook or something open so you can still talk to people. I was chatting with like 10 different people on 3 different IM clients the last time I did methylone alone, and it was really a good experience. I was helping people with their personal problems and in turn it made me feel better about my own issues.

				Tripping alone has always been the most enjoyable for me. My girlfriend is very new to psychedelics, as are most of my friends....tripping as a group tends to make at least one person paranoid, and it spreads to everyone. Bad vibes all around, not sure why -- we&#039;ll work it out another day.<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;ve had LSD, DMT, 25i and shrooms alone all on separate occasions...very fun. 25i + music (floyd) was a blast, I leaned back in my chair and saw the most brilliant dragon-shaped diamond slithering around on my ceiling.<br /><br />I want to also mention that everything was a relatively small/medium dose... 2 medium strength tabs for LSD, 35mg DMT, 600ug 25i, 3g shrooms.<br /><br />I suggest starting small and working your way up, as I am continuing to do. Also have bud on hand if you smoke, it always alters the experience but be prepared, on shrooms specifically (for me anyways) it makes things go haywire...not necessarily bad but might not be your cup of tea. Safe travels my friend.

				Skipped pages 2 &amp; 3 cuz I&#039;m lazy but I noticed the DMT topic come up again. I just posted about this but quick recap:<br />My first psyc was DMT. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t really know what I was getting in for but I had some supportive friends with me who helped keep me calm while I was blasting away. If you decide to do an all day thing: shrooms early morning and DMT evening, I&#039;d suggest having a friend who&#039;s been there before or who will support you while you go through it. DMT is intense but it&#039;s probably the most fun I&#039;ve had on a drug--especially in such a short time.<br /><br />All the best,

				I don&#039;t do many drugs, just weed and psychedelics, but I do like to smoke weed by myself and reflect on different concepts and/or listen to music. I used to be strictly a social smoker, but as my love for bud grew stronger, I started smoking by myself more often. I do agree about psychedelics being fun when taken with a group of people. Some of the best times I had on psychedelics (lsd, boomers) were with other people. When I do psychs by myself, my trips become more intrapersonal. The only time I cry is when I&#039;m on psychedelics. Self-loathing thoughts are constantly swirling in my mind, or the thoughts of how poorly I treat my mother and sibling causes me to breakdown into tears. It&#039;s hard to love anyone when one doesn&#039;t love him or herself. I guess that&#039;s why I&#039;m constantly single. I hope one day I can find peace in my heart, and learn how to love thyself, but I digress.<br /><br /><br />Random thought: I&#039;ve been thinking to myself, &quot;I&#039;ve been smoking bud for almost eight years (it&#039;s depressing when I think about it financially), but since I joined SR two months ago, I&#039;ve been smoking some of the best green of my life.&quot;

				I just want to add MDMA to this list. Not a popular opinion (most people say it&#039;s a waste) but I personally thought it was amazing. A lot of time to analyze my life (but in a positive way, where as psychadelics can get a bit negative) and a lot of fun. I spent a few hours pumping dubstep through my body and enjoying all the extra energy I had. Felt like I was floating around the house.

				MDMA alone is hardly a waste, if anything I find it that much more therapeutic being alone on Molly. I think it&#039;s great fun to do personal research with drugs, for instance I try to become familiar with every drug during all times of the day and night, at varying dosages, alone or with a group, and even in different settings listening to different genres of music.

				I agree with the above posters. Especially Gary: my first thought when trying MDMA solo during the day was that you gotta try drugs in different venues, different people, different times/settings to really explore the pleasures and experiences that can be drawn from a particular drug. <br /><br />I get excited checkin out doing the same drugs and just changing stuff a little: something litle like lighting can make a big difference in taking drugs--especially dmt etc.<br /><br />Cheers ;D

				Out of your list, I would say DMT.&nbsp; Personally, I would much rather smoke deemsters alone in my room, meditatively, and with the perfect music and lighting on, instead of in a social setting.&nbsp; Unless everyone is smoking their DMT at the EXACT SAME TIME, the eyes of everyone in the room will be on you as you blast off, which can be unsettling.&nbsp; DMT alone is much more enjoyable for me, as long as I can will myself to take that third hit...

I think it&#039;s great fun to do personal research with drugs, for instance I try to become familiar with every drug during all times of the day and night, at varying dosages, alone or with a group, and even in different settings listening to different genres of music. It&#039;s pretty sad how some people choose to only experience drugs one specific way and then stick to it, where is their sense of adventure and curiosity I wonder? :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve been reading some clearnet forums about &#039;losing the magic&#039; (new to MDMA but loved it, and don&#039;t want to ruin it in the future...) and one poster said that mixing the experience up a bit has helped them never lose it. Set and setting and all that.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best posts I&#039;ve seen about how to get the most out of your chemical experiences.

				I mostly trip alone since starting out with DMT as my first psychoactive drug. Go in at the deep end and swim towards the shallows were my initial thoughts. Who can find 12 hours to trip on LSD with a family life? Because of the family life and disapproving partner, I trip/use drugs alone or with a close trip buddy if I can. Using drugs alone alone can be great fun, rewarding and also a little scary.<br /><br />So your selections depend hugely on your personal life circumstances. <br /><br />In my case I use canabis, DMT, 2C-B, LSD, and mild ayahuasca. XTC&nbsp; alone can be ok, but it is a very social drug, and while 2C-B is great socially it can also be good alone.<br /><br />If tripping or using any drug alone there are some key points that I consider.<br /><br />I am always over cautions with the dose amount, for anything other than cannabis, for the obvious reasons. Large does of any of the other drugs can lead one into issues when alone.<br /><br />I am careful with the desire to re-dose, you should set your limits before you trip decide what you are comfortable with and stick to it. Re-dosing alone can lead to some nasty outcomes. I have done the usual locking myself out of my apartment with drug paraphernalia laying around after caving into a desire to re-dose. Much better to dose, re dose to a set plan and increase the next time rather than chase a high this time.<br /><br />Life is long, you will get another chance blah blah blah <br /><br />I chose my time. place and setting carefully. In the locking out of the apartment, it was sunny, my partner was in another country so I knew that I wasn&#039;t going to be faced with an argument, time at the relationship shrink. As my recreation drug use has caused before&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />I know that a good friend who if I warn that I may be tripping using drugs alone will never refuse a call from me. This has come in handy on the re-dosing issue. Choose this person carefully, one who has experience of the drugs you are taking who won&#039;t be judgmental, and will be sober enough to be able to help you out.&nbsp; In general we are bad intuitive decision makers when outside of our comfortable normal mental state. <br /><br />Using any drug alone is about reducing the potential harm not just to you but to others. Sorry to sound like a middle aged bore here, but you will make mistakes taking drugs alone if you do not consider the risks.<br /><br />You&#039;ll make mistakes taking drugs socially as well, but there are few old bold drug takers, as there are few young bold ones for long either... ;)<br /><br />Edit: Yes and I give the above talk to my teenage daughter as well&nbsp; ::)

				I&#039;d try mushrooms in low doses first. Rocker usually has some great ones listed. Try 2.0 or 1.5 until you get comfortable tripping alone, then feel free to up the dosage at your leisure.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be safe<br /><br /><br />Shifty
