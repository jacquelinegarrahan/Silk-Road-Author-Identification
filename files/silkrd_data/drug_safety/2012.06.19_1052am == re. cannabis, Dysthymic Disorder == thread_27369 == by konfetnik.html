				For my introductory post, I would like to begin with a little about me. I suffer from what is called neurotic depression. This is characterized by a consistently low mood. Symptoms are typically less severe than those of Major Depressive Disorder, but are longer lasting. Among my symptoms are motivational anhedonia (a lack of desire to initiate or engage in activity) and sexual anhedonia (in that I derive little pleasure from the erotic; I sometimes find that my orgasms do not meet my expectations with regards to how pleasurable I find them). I am on an anti-depressant cocktail of bupropion, citalopram, and abilify that elevates my mood rather consistently (and, to an extent, addresses my ejaculatory anhedonia), but I find that the symptoms of rumination and motivational anhedonia to the point of self-destructive apathy persist. I have yet to really make any progress with my psychiatrist in this regard. It has been suggested that I seek out cognitive-behavioral therapy, but I remain convinced that the best thing for me is a supplement to my ongoing chemical therapy. Enter cannabis. Cannabis and I have a tricky relationship with one another. One the one hand, when my prescriptions have normalized my mood, responsibly used cannabis sees an increase in my productivity, very much against the stereotype of the lazy stoner. Cannabis makes me &quot;hungry&quot; in a poetic sense, and I feel motivated to initiate activities. On the other hand, I have attempted to self-medicate with cannabis to relieve an overall low mood, which, in turn, exacerbated my habit of rumination and saw me slide into a comfortable apathy in which I was content to distract myself from productive activity. There is also the problem of paranoia, as my living conditions put me at particular risk for discovery of its use (I live in an apartment complex), and local laws against cannabis are some of the harshest in my part of the world. Despite my persisting worries, I have been able to enjoy smoking cannabis in my complex for almost two years; I see no reason to rule out consumption of cannabis in this traditional way.<br /><br />I come to the forum, however, seeking advice. My interest lies in the psychoactive constituent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. As a student of the arts, I am particularly interested in modes of consumption that will, building upon a mood normalized by the three pharmaceuticals I had mentioned above, encourage creative patterns of thinking without robbing me of my wits or confining me to some lethargic state. I am looking to make the initiation of tasks more appetizing to myself, overall, thus assisting me in overcoming my motivational anhedonia. I am interested in what people have to say about modes of consuming Δ9-THC that will keep me active and lucid. I am not strictly a smoker, either; I welcome all suggestions as to what mode of consumption would produce the desired effect. For example, some of you reading this may have certain strains of the cannabis plant to recommend. Others may encourage an exploration of certain edibles. Still others may recommend delivery of Δ9-THC to my system through capsules. I am grateful for the guidance of those more experienced than me in this regard.

				THC is one of many active substances found in cannabis there are also about 60-70 different cannabinoids - different strains have different combinations and ratios of this cannabinoids id suggest researching what strain is best for ur condition <br /><br />id also suggest vaporizing ur weed or make edibles so ur are not destroying any cannabinoids through the process of smoking <br /><br />it could be that CBD might help u more than THC so id suggest do some more research into the weed and its medical effects on depression <br />

				That is interesting. I was not aware of cannabidiol before your post, and my limited research into the chemical shows that not only does it inhibit cancer cell growth (something that shall hopefully only be considered a preventative measure!), it also reduces anxiety. Perhaps through combustion of plant matter, this substance is lost, making way for the paranoia so typically associated with cannabis. Through your advice, I shall invest into repairing my vaporizer, if I might, or perhaps seek out a new one, depending on which is more cost effective and convenient. Thank you!

				Yes high CBD weed are the more suitable to calm down anxiety and those ones are way less paranoid than the sativa, haze and so one.<br /><br />Seek for high CBD weed and give it a try, vaporize is the way to go for sure. Blue cheese, blueberry or some white strains are high cbd content, that put you in a cloud but doesn&#039;t give many energy like the haze, more couch.<br /><br />By the way, paranoia prooves that your brain is working, this is like LSD, when you have finish the trip you can feel paranoid, thinking of many things very fast, going up and down, but paranoia on weed stay the time you are baked, not days like lsd :)<br /><br />Barney&#039;s Farm has plenty of good weed for medicinal use.<br /><br />For creativity, the weed is cool, not too much for sure, but it open your ears, mind just like it should, it is not too overpowering if not too much consumption but keeps mainly your ideas in memory and you feel more in connexion with what you do.<br /><br />This is like i feel it. A lot of people can&#039;t smoke but for me i feel it like this,<br /><br />All the other drugs put your mind in and out, sure you have incredible effects but it is almost impossible to create.<br /><br />This is my opinion but you should try because everybody doesn&#039;t react the same manner.<br /><br />Moroccan hash also can work great for anxiety.

				1. THC is readily soluble in butter and milk.<br />2. ROA: oral, smoke, vape.<br />3. Oral: whole, cookies, milk shake, capsules are pointless.<br /><br />Anyone tried eating ABV before? Bro ate some, then became delirious and puked his guts out 3-4 hours later in the middle of the night. Nausea and puking lasted like 3 hours, was so sick couldn&#039;t even open his eyes fully.<br /><br />Bro also tried eating some fresh tasty hash and went so sick and couch-locked had to squat in the toilet motionless for 1 hour and find a place to lie down for 2 hours. All the while having closed eyes hallucination while battling the nausea.

				Thank you all for the advice! It looks like I would be interested in blue cheese (which, coincidentally, is my favorite kind of actual cheese). I don&#039;t know much about A.B.V. or eating hash, so I can&#039;t really speak to anyone&#039;s experience with it. Paranoia is evidence of a healthy attention paid to potential danger, but no one who smokes enjoys being preoccupied with fear and unpleasant rumination.<br /><br />Can anyone with experience share what they know about high-cannabidiol strains? I should be especially interested in those strains that are not particularly lethargic. I&#039;m interested in cannabis&#039;s potential for improving my motivation through the relief of my tendency towards anhedonia.
