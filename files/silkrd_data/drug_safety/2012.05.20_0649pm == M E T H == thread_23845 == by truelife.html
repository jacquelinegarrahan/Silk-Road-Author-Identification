				Well i would say if i were to try meth which i never will i would snort it. Cause smoking crystal meth is not the healthiest way of using meth. I actually think the health risk of smoking it is what makes the typical meth head turn into a poster child one of those posters they use to warn people about meth use.. You know the type no teeth cheek bones up their forehead and eyes almost disappearing into their eye socket.. but hey it&#039;s your life

				Meth is a drug demonized by the media. As with every drug that gets demonized to this extent the results of recreational use and extreme addiction get confused as we get bombarded with pictures of worst case scenarios.<br />Have you seen an alcohol worst case scenario? It looks fucking horrific. I still drink wine from time to time...<br /><br />Guess what: if you stop sleeping, stop brushing teeth, sell your ass on a street corner, get STDs and smoke/inject cutting agents your beauty might fade a bit. Occasional use will not harm you though. No matter if you snort it or smoke it...<br />The health risk of smoking is that it is more fun to most people and you might like it a bit too much. That smoking makes your teeth rot is nonsense (it&#039;s because stimulants suppress saliva flow and hardcore users don&#039;t brush). That smoked meth recrystallizes in your lungs and therefore damages them is bullshit, too (of course smoking anything is hardly healthy).<br />The danger of addiction is highly exaggerated by the &quot;not even once&quot; ads and its kin. Just be aware how often you take it in which doses. <br />For detailed and concrete information about this topic you MUST read this:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.msg230562#msg230562<br /><br />I smoked meth ...just once... and my teeth are still there. <br />I tried only 25mg and I was nicely stimulated the whole evening.<br /><br />To answer your 4th question (I think the rest has been answered):<br />You put it in a methpipe melt the crystals and heat it careful until it vaporizes. Take away the flame if it vapor appears. You can&nbsp; roll the pipe a bit while you do this (especially if you put a lot of crystal inside).<br />Its thick white vapor. Some resin might stay in the pipe and turn dark.

				I&#039;ve had meth once before and wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone I even remotely care about. I&#039;ve never felt so tweaked out in my life. It was my sister&#039;s first time on it as well, and I&#039;ve never been more frightened in my life than I was tweaked out on that shit and seeing my sister in the same state. Do yourself a favor and just don&#039;t do it, it&#039;s one of those drugs that just isn&#039;t worth it. :-\

				I recently purchased a gram off a Canadian vendor after going out one weekend and hitting a few pipes from my mate.<br /><br />I&#039;d tried it two or three times before.<br /><br />Anyway, I got my gram and bought a $10 pipe. I was doing tiny 5-10mg burns before work in the morning for 3-4 days. It really helped my work day go a lot faster also making it more enjoyable.<br /><br />I was loving hitting that pipe, watching the shard melt and vapor swirl around in the bulb. I was getting very profficiant at it too. The pipe is very habit forming.<br /><br />Smoked about .2 over this past w/e, with no real sleep, just a few hours here and there. By the 3rd day if I stared at anything for long enough I would begin to hallucinate, instead of seeing an object as it was in reality it would begin to morph into usually odd cartoon type figures, very trippy indeed. Not scary at all. I was also having trouble concentrating. No doubt, all due to the sleep deprivation.<br /><br />Anyway, to sum it up. It&#039;s not something you want to do often. I think I may of hit it too hard, I now at present have 0 desire to do anymore. I feel sick just thinking about the smell or taste, or even looking at the pipe. I&#039;m going to go smash it. I&#039;d like to be rid of this .8 I have left so I&#039;m not tempted, although I&#039;m not right now. It makes me feel dirty just having it around.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to try it only buy a small, small amount maybe a 1/4 of a gram or less and make it for very rare or for special occasions. Or you could hit it hard like I did to feel the full effects and hopefully put yourself off it for life.

				I say it&#039;s addictive, and there&#039;s a documentary says how it can destroy your receptors in your brain something like that so that you no longer feel &#039;happiness&#039; or &#039;pleasure&#039; after prolonged use.<br /><br />This is because with high dosage, Meth lets you feel extreme &#039;joy&#039; and once hooked, everything around you becomes gray, boring, depressing and meaningless without Meth.<br /><br />1 weird thing is 12 hours after trying it, still can have the taste of Meth down the throat and mouth.<br /><br />Having it destroying your life is 1 thing, but don&#039;t be a burden or interfere with others due to your habit. Be a responsible adult and not a kid experimenting drugs.

It&#039;s not something you want to do as a habit. It&#039;s more like something to do on a 6-8 month basis. It takes over other drugs so you wont feel them while your doing meth. I haven&#039;t had any in months. I got tired of it and it dilates your pupils like acid and you will hallucinate from it especially if you go for three or four days with no sleep and your still doing it. I&#039;ve done my share of it and I can say it&#039;s pretty much evil. Hitler made his soldiers take it during the war. Yea to snort one line will keep you up for about 2 days if it&#039;s quality meth.
