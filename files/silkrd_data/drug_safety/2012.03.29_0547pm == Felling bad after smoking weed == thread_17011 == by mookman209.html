				Not sure if this is the one or should be in other topic but. My friend gets his weed from cali and I have had weed that makes me feel good and happy, but I have had to stop smoking because I started feeling bad when I do it and its kind of regular now. Its not a body feeling bad it&#039;s more of something like mental feeling of feeling bad I don&#039;t think its guilt because I would have felt it when i started and not now.

				For me, it depends a lot on how I feel going into the smoke session. If I&#039;ve taken care of all my responsibilities, if I am not stressed out, if everything is in order, then I will have a good smoke session and feel happy. But if I am behind on my work, if there are serious things coming up or things not attended to, and if I will smoke then, I will feel terrible.

				Weed affects everyone differently, when I was obsessed with ingesting it I triggered my anxiety disorder and every time I ingested THC I would get anxiety no matter what dosage. I suggest starting off with a low dose of an indica strain and see if you still feel bad after, if you do I would just avoid smoking to be honest.

				Thanks both of you for the dose recommendation and for the other part of the advice I was oblivious to and probably should have thought about haha .

				I smoked several times a day every day for a couple years. Eventually I got to the point where weed made me so anxious, nervous, and paranoid, I had to stop. I sorta miss it, the body high, the way I experienced food and music... but it was making me crazy.<br /><br />Weed&#039;s one of those drugs that affects everyone differently. I have some friends who love blazing with each other, going off and doing stupid shit; when I smoked I preferred to be alone, and reflecting.

				Been smoking quality stuff for 20 years. The first five years daily i guess. When i got my first job i got all paranoid about people in work finding out (totally illogical as most younger people at the job where also).<br /><br />At that point i think i developed a sorta anxiety disorder as well until it got to the point i was getting heartbeatings and felt numbness in my arms. Even went to the hospital once in such a panic attack. <br /><br />After that i really took it more easy for a couple of years and focussed more on other drugs (mdma and C).<br /><br />Fast forward to now. Even smoking a tiny amount (just smelling almost) triggers some anxiety but much less in combination with alcohol. So i drink a few beers and then take a few hits and mostly i&#039;m good. Very cheap for me though :) I usually have some valium or whatever lying around &quot;just in case&quot; (and knowing i have this option is in itself soothing). <br /><br />So yeah, i use the herb more as a upper you could say, which is kinda... weird.. Sorta reversed adhd. When time to go to sleep i&#039;m mostly in the zone / coming down and than it&#039;s no problem.
