				Ok, so I have a little bit of a issue with measuring out dosages.<br /><br />I have some 2c-i. (1g)<br />Some friends and I are planning&nbsp; to use SOME of it this weekend (hence why I need the advice NOW).<br />I do not have a milligram scale (or the time to buy one) but would seriously like to be able to meter out some doses.<br />I know that I can use volumetric bu mixing it with alcohol (1ml per 5mg). <br />However I&#039;m afraid that It will not stay very stable in this form.<br />I also would like to try plugging this stuff some time and the idea of shooting pure ethanol up my bum seems painful.<br />I would ideally like to be able to meter out about 100mg and then mix THAT with the ethanol but keep the other 900mg as a powder.<br /><br />Is there anyway I can measure out doses without eyeballing or relying purely on volumetric?<br /><br />Please respond quickley as I have to have this all done by 3:00 EST, tomorrow.

				If you were to find something that weighed exactly 100 mg, you could set up a crude balance. Dont know how safe it would be but seems like the only make-shift way I can come up with right now. <br /><br />Just fyi, 2c-i in 95% etoh has been stored in the dark at room temp for greater than a year with only a small decrease in noticeable potency. <br /><br />Fyi, DO NOT shoot etoh straight into your rear, many people have died of alcohol poisoning due to this stupid idea.

				The short answer is &quot;no&quot;. The only reliable way to measure out small volumes of powder without a scale is by dissolving them in something and using the volumetric method.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never stored 2c-i in ethanol, but from what I&#039;ve heard it&#039;ll keep very stably as long as you keep it in a cool place. It&#039;s supposed to be a pretty stable molecule to begin with, so long as it doesn&#039;t come into contact with water. Don&#039;t take my word for it, though, since I&#039;m not speaking from experience.<br /><br />One possible solution is improvising a balance scale with some office supplies or cupholders or what-have-you. You can then divide your 1g in half (by balancing both sides of the scale), then divide that half in half, and once more to get 125mg. Then you can use volumetric measuring on that and keep the other 875. It&#039;s not the 1/9 split you&#039;re aiming for, but it&#039;s close. Your makeshift scale won&#039;t be extremely precise, but it&#039;ll probably be a lot more precise than eyeballing it.

				great idea horizons using the balance to just split the powder equally, rather than trying to find something that weighed the correct amount as I was thinking<br /><br />if you do this, make sure the balance point is in the EXACT middle, even being just slightly off could result in a significant error over a few measurements. i image the makeshift balance somehow accidentally spilling all the powder too so make sure it cant tilt too far in either direction, but its better than eyeballing for sure.

				My solution is 50/50 labware whiskey and water<br />Is the water in the solution going to hurt the 2c-i?

				tap water?<br /><br />use distilled/deionized whenever you can<br />as to hurting 2ci, chemist would know...

				I have no idea what water was used in the production if the moonshine.<br />But, I DO have distilled water at home. Should I maybe mix it with that instead of alcohol. <br />I hear that 2c-i isn&#039;t particularly soluble in water, is this true?

				then you must be willing to risk the possibility of taking double the &quot;strong&quot; dose<br />there really isn&#039;t a way to get accurate mg doses without a scale<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml

				Why not just buy a scale, they are widely available, electronic stores sell them, markets, even ebay.&nbsp; They are not expensive.&nbsp; I picked up a set in a local market for $20 that are accurate to .001 gram.&nbsp; These scales are used for a lot more than drugs e.g. jewellery.

				Ok, I went the volumetric method (no plugging with this batch). 50/50 alcohol.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to definitely pick up a scale before my next order, it makes life SOOO much easier.

				Don&#039;t mean to piggy back off this thread, but what if I have a scale that measures .01 of a gram?&nbsp; Is there anyway to measure out milligrams?

				Not really in any accurate manner. Most scales that weigh to 0.01g have a 0.005g margin of error. So something measuring 0.01g could be up at 5 g more than you were wanting. When it comes to some drugs, that 5mg really makes a difference. Amazon is having a sale right now for a American Weigh Gemini-20 Portable Milligram Scale, 20 by 0.001 G for 55% off, bringing down the usual price of $49.95 to $22.26.
