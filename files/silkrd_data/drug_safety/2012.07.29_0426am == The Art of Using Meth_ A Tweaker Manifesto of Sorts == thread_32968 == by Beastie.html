				I&#039;d like to hear people options for the best way to use Meth.<br /><br />No need to post anything like, &quot;The best way to use Meth is Not At All.&quot;<br />We tweakers probably all agree with that statement, but we have decided that the benefits out-way the cost in our cases at this time.<br /><br />*** My thoughts ***<br /><br />It seems to me the best way to use Meth is Smoking from a glass pipe. Whenever I snort it the comedown is vary unpleasant, almost as bad as coming down from coke. However, when I smoke it from a glass pipe I basically have no comedown at all.<br /><br />The other big thing for using Meth, is to first reach your Zen with the stuff. You know like how the first few times you use MDMA you geek-out and stuff. Then after a few times MDMA dose not make you loose complete control any more. I&#039;m not talking about a physical adaptation to the drug, though that dose play a big role to finding the Meth Zen, I mean finding your metal Zen with the drug.... Like at first when I did Meth I would get a super tweaked out and could not seep for two days, and totally acted like I was all tweaked out. However, after I burned through a few grams of Crystals, which took about 5 weeks, I no longer get all tweaked out from Meth. I still get high, except I maintain control of my mind and I can even sleep every night no problem. I also no longer feel the need to just keep smoking until it is all gone. Like, my decision making abilities are no longer effected.<br /><br />Owe, and remember to eat. Eat good food not fast food. Have some fruit juice, a salad, and some bagels with pesto, tomatoes, olives, onions and stuff.<br /><br />What works for me now that I have found my Crystal Zen, is this. On Mondays and Wednesdays&nbsp; when I only have one college class and get home at 2pm, I&#039;ll smoke like 0.05g of crystal and then do all my home work. Go to sleep at 12am. Then wake up the next day for a long day of school at 7:30am. I&#039;ll also smoke about 0.05g when I get up in the morning at ~10am on Saturday, and another 0.05g at 4pm. Then I&#039;ll do homework and study all day Saturday. <br /><br />This schedule works vary well for me. Without the Meth I tend to procrastinate, and wait until the last day before an assignment is due. Then rush through it. With this Meth schedule I actually end up being one or two assignments ahead of&nbsp; the class ;) I also learn a whole lot more, because whit the little bit of Meth I&#039;ll just get totally locked into doing homework. I read everything vary closely instead of skimming through it. I will also put my 110% effort into completing assignments. With all that said, I do get nearly strait A&#039;s in collage with or without Meth, cumulative GPA 3.7. However, I do feel like I deserve the good grades better with this Meth schedule, because I really give it my all.<br /><br />I just giggle inside when I get A&#039;s and know all the answers to the teachers questions. Then other people in the class are like, &quot;How do you find the time to learn all this stuff? I can barly keep up with all this work!&quot; I&#039;d love to tell them, &quot;Just smoke some Meth ;) You&#039;ll finish reading this history book by the end of the week.&quot; However, I don&#039;t tell anyone I tweak. It is my little secret, The Ace Up My Sleeve, if you will ;P<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; However, considering all this. I&#039;ve been seriously contemplating going to a Doctor and getting a prescription for Adderall. Adderall is basically just Amphetamine, so I bet it too will help me focus and get my work done.... I mean that is what it is for. I just don&#039;t want to be on record for having some mental problem like ADD.... on the other hand, getting caught with Meth would be way worse to have on my record.... Any thoughts or suggestions?<br /><br />*** End ***<br /><br />So, How about it?<br />I can&#039;t be the only tweaker who has found a way to use Meth in a productive, non-destructive way.<br /><br />Let me hear from other tweakers who are productive members of society.<br /><br />

However, I really don&#039;t experience any addiction. What happened to me is that now that I have built up a tolerance and mental Zen to Meth, I no longer crave it like I did at first. Like I don&#039;t feel the need to keep smoking more when I start to come down. I have not noticed any physical withdrawal symptoms when I run out of crystal ether. It seems I am not easily addicted to drugs in general? <br /><br />Ya, I think I&#039;ll maybe order some Adderall to see if it gets me studding. If it works out, I think I will just go get Adderall from a Doctor. However, I&#039;ll not take it everyday like the Doctor will say to. I&#039;ll just take the pills on the days I need to study.<br /><br />As long as the Adderall is effective enough, I would really not miss the Meth. I basically just use it as a tool not a recreational drug, so if the Adderall produces the same super motivated to work effect..., like I don&#039;t even want to kick back and watch netflix. I just want to get to work, and actually get a little bummed out when I finish all my homework :p I&#039;ll be happy with Adderall and not miss Meth.<br /><br />.. Boy I find it so funny now to think about how all the parents are giving there kids Adderall to study. Adderall is just &quot;dextroamphetamine and amphetamine&quot;. It also make scents to me now why doctors basically say every kid a parent brings in who has trouble in school has ADHD and gives them Adderall. I use to think that doctors were over diagnosing ADHD. Now I see that the doctors don&#039;t really need to waste time deciding if the kid really has ADHD or not, because if they give the kid Amphetamine it is vary likely the kid will surely sit down and focus :p
