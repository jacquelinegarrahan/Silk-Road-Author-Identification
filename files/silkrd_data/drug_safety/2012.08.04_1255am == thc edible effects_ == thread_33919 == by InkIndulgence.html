				Helllllooo my friends,<br /><br />I was just wanting to get some input on mj edibles. My boyfriend and I have never tried them before, but we have both smoked weed for a very long time, him off and on, me much more often. So we received our order of cookies today, and we split one, each eating half. It has been 2 1/2 hours since we took them. Right now, he is so stoned he can barely open his eyes and says he is so high it is almost uncomfortable. I, on the other hand, feel literately nothing. Not even a little bit. I&#039;m super jealous. He is almost twice my size, and I guess this is the perfect example of how the same amount of a drug can affect two people very differently.<br /><br />My question is, has enough time past (2.5 hours) to where if I was going to feel the effects, I would have by now and can go ahead and eat more? Or could they still be waiting to take effect, and I should wait longer? Any tips helpful!

				It really just all depends, if you have a slow metabolism it could take you up to 3 hours to feel any effects and if you ate before you took the edible it could take even longer but I feel it would be safe to take another half since it&#039;s been 2.5 hours.

				I&#039;ve tried making &quot;Firecrackers&quot; on 3 or 4 seperate occasions, followed the guides to a T and every time I too felt absolutely nothing. I have a pretty low tolerance for MJ so I have to assume edibles just don&#039;t work on some people :(

				From my experience with edibles, the more you eat beforehand - the higher the chances of it not affecting you. <br />I&#039;ve eaten some hash brownies yesterday, fucked up me and&nbsp; friend of mine, but the other two friends barely felt anything. the difference between us is that we haven&#039;t eaten anything (except for a mango to try and boost the effect) prior to the brownies and the other two had a big meal.<br /><br />My point is - try not eating anything for the whole day, then eating a whole cookie. maybe a mango would help too.

				Yeah ^ agreed.&nbsp; Best thing about edibles is how massively hard they kick your ass if you do them properly. bad thing is that they rarely work properly or as good as peopel expect them to work.<br /><br />Advise for your eating sesssion:<br />1) dont eat anything for 3 hours before, MINIMUM<br />2) DO NO SMOKE ANY WEED THAT DAY. smoking weed beforehand is only going to make it impossible to notice (or impaired to say the least)<br />3) try to be tired or worn out when you eat it, i notice that when im tired after a long day at work and i come home and munch a honey-cookie it works a lot better than when i wake up fresh in the morning etc.<br />4) eat it with a STRONG, SHORT, COFFEE. Self explanatory for most come ups. :)

				OP, did you ever experience any effects later? I&#039;m assuming you&#039;d update us if you did, unless you were too high&nbsp; :P

				Sorry for not replying sooner.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking that it was a combination of what people mentioned, as well as me having a higher tolerance for mj.<br /><br />I had already eaten that day, whereas he had not. Also thc was not the only drug I ingested that day, and he had not had anything else.<br /><br />I also think the distribution of the thc was a factor. The next day (yesterday) I ate a whole cookie first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, and he ate half of a different cookie. Almost the opposite effect happened. He got a little stoned, but nowhere near like the day before on the same amount. I however definitely felt the effects, I was still not incredibly high but had a good buzz for sure. <br /><br />I have always for some reason been able to smoke copious amounts of weed without ever getting &quot;too high&quot;, it&#039;s like I reach a ceiling at some point and cannot get any higher, anything smoked past that is pretty much wasting weed to me. I am always irritated when I am with people or hear someone who describes being so high they see differently and get all giddy and out of their mind, as I haven&#039;t felt that since I first started smoking in high school.<br /><br />So overall, decent experience. I will definitely be more prepared if there is a next time. However for now I think I&#039;ll stick to good ol dependable smoke.<br /><br />Thanks for all the input guys.
