				Some weeks ago I ordered from a SR vendor Etizolam 2mg pills. Etizolam is similar to benzos. Its a relaxant, good for sleeping and coming down.<br /><br />anyway I found later on the CLEARNET around five UK based websites where you can order similar looking pills online. I say similar because what I have in my hand and what I see there on the picture looks exactly the same, even the colour.<br /><br />anyway the UK based internet sites claim it is a benzo but at the end one can see its written NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.<br /><br />I suppose a vendor who sold me those pills had bought them over one of those UK based web sites although he claimed the pills were made in Germany.<br /><br />I just want to ask of anyone here had had experience with this type of Etizolam. <br />it just makes me a bit afraid to swallow a pill and to know that it comes from an online web site where probably the pill itself could be totally fake<br /><br />so any experience guys???<br /><br />

				The &#039;not for human consumption&#039; part of it may simply be a cover up. In the US mixtures of herbs and synthetic cannabinoids seem to be on sale with a similar label, and sold as potpourri or incense. <br /><br />Apart from that, i have never seen red tablets of etizolam - they usually are rather small tablets with a baby-blue color. This by no means indicates the ones you have are fake though. I suppose they may actually be etizolam, but not big-pharma pressed tablets.
