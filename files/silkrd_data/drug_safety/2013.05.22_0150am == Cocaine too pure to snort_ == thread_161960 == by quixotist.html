			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve seen a few people talk about cocaine being too pure to snort when it reaches around 80%, and judging by the cocaine testing thread I&#039;m in &quot;danger&quot; of getting shit that strong. I&#039;ve had an occasional sinus ache since a big weekend about a month ago and I&#039;d like another weekend just like it, starting this Friday and hopefully not stopping until Monday evening.<br /><br />So, when I buy some high quality coke from vendors here should I not wash it to remove cuts? <br /><br />If I do wash it, should I be stepping on it afterwards so I don&#039;t do myself any damage? What with? <br /><br />Should I get a neti pot and clean my sinus afterwards instead/too?<br /><br />Should I rub it on my gums instead of snorting, or maybe plug the shit instead?<br /><br />Can any more experienced users offer some advice? <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Q

				If you are 100% sure the stuff you are getting is 75%+ pure, I would save the trouble and not wash it unless you have the time and resources. <br /><br />Snorting any powder isn&#039;t &quot;healthy&quot; but obviously the more pure the coke is the less damage it will do.&nbsp; However, it would still be wise to clean out your nostrils and sinuses with either saline spray or neti pot after heavy use.<br /><br />The trick with snorting pure cocaine is just do little at a time :)

				No it wouldn&#039;t kill you it just means you have smaller doses. 35-50mg. Iv had 100 mg once of pure and it made my heart race fast.&nbsp; You can just tell pure coke from a mile away. Ah bring in the tea bags

				The purer the better - just make smaller lines.<br />If the blow is as pure as claimed then you will have less issues afterwards - not so much blocking etc. etc.<br /><br />If you use blow frequently then another issue might arise - cocaine leaves behind a weak hydrocloric acid which over time will degrade the septum in your nose (you know that middle thing separating the <br />nostrils). It is due to the absorption of from cocaine hydrochloride and if that happens it is irreversible.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not sure if this happens by in-frequent use over many years or only by chronic use - anybody???<br /><br />

				There is something about the high from good pure coke that makes it so loveable and unique. <br /><br />It is a smooth ride up to the peak that lasts a good 30-40minutes and a smooth come down that leaves you feeling normal.&nbsp; The euphoria it self is so warm and energetic while not overpowering that you can&#039;t act normal except maybe you are talking very fast non stop with a big grin on your face.<br /><br />It is a very fun hour of no worries and just pure joy.&nbsp; That is was true coke is all about.

				My personal experience is that: yes, there is coke that is too clean to be insuflated...<br /><br />Back in the days when I was still smoking lots of this product I would always look for highest purity - the more pure it was, the better the effect when smoked or injected. But since then, many years ago, I stopped smoking it (yes it was hard to quit) and at first I would still buy the purest stuff I could find - but soon I notest that stuff that is very pure (above 80 or 85% or so) often hurts the nose more than less pure stuff and the rush (when insuflated) is often less intense and shorter lasting than good quality C of 70 to 80%. <br /><br />So, to my opinion, yes there is C that is &quot;too&quot; pure to insuflate - but just because you have much more effect from it when injecting/smoking it and, in comparison, you have more effect when snorting coke that is a little less pure... <br /><br />But these are just my 2 pennies...

It could be that most chemists are only able to purify the cocaine leaves into 70% (or a bit higher) - this doesn&#039;t mean there are active CUTS, it could only mean that some of the (harder to isolate) alkaloids of the cocaleave are left in the pasta... maybe those alkaloids have an impact on the effect of the coke (maybe they are not active on themselves but do have an influence when taken together with the C). <br />It&#039;s just an idea, but I&#039;d love to know more about it... <br /><br />I also know that when I used to wash my stuff myself you SHOULD NEVER snort washed stuff !!! It&#039;s dangerous and fucks your nose up for the rest of your life in just a few lines (personal experience :(&nbsp; ).<br /><br />Indead, very pure coke has a subtle effect - but the euphoria and the energy-bom should be there, if it&#039;s not there then it&#039;s either less pure coke, or the coke should be used for smoking/shooting... and when you snort very pure C (85 and more %) you have almost zero euphoria and zero enery-boost from it, that&#039;s when you know it&#039;s too pure for insuflating and should be IV&#039;ed or based...
