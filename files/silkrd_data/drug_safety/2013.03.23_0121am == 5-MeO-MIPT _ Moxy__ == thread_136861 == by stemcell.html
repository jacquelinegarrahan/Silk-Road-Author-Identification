				I&#039;ve used it a few times. It&#039;s not bad but it&#039;s not particularly obvious to me either. It provides some mood elevation, a bit of visual enhancement, a slight body buzz but nothing like &quot;Fuck I&#039;m high!&quot;.<br /><br />This is based off a single sample of the stuff taken in doses ranging from 5-35mg. My results, coupled with my wife as well, seem somewhat unusual so it might be the supply I got was weak or not all Moxy.<br /><br />As an example, my wife and I took about 20mg each and she got some insane laughing fits out of it to the point she was actually in tears. I wasn&#039;t quite there but it was definitely fun. They say it&#039;s supposed to make sex amazing but when we gave it a go after the laughing subsided there really wasn&#039;t anything there... she was physically aroused but not emotionally if that makes sense.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to grab some more from a different vendor and do a little more research on it. I had fun taking it but I felt like I was just missing something from it. I got elevated but not high. Things felt good but not great. I had hoped upping the dose would sort it out but I never found an amount that did it for me off that supply anyway.<br /><br />I know this may not help too much. I just figure lots of people are like &quot;It&#039;s the shit!&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s the bomb!&quot; so I figured I&#039;d give you a bit more detail to decide for yourself.

				marijuana is not illegal in all states, prerty leagal just by getting a dr to say you suffer from pain how do you not know that? To top it off big pharma is not running that. I asked a simple question meaning is this some type of research chemical that is not yet banned or what is it as i have never heard of it until now. I was asking for information regarding its use from peoples experience i didnt need someone give me a lesson on big pharma but thank you.

				Marijuana is illegal in the USA... maybe you do need a lesson or two. Some states have laws that allow it but try to explain that to the DEA or a Federal Judge regardless of what state you live in. My lesson was to emphasize a point which is that you don&#039;t even need to ask if something is illegal since everything is covered under a huge catch all of the drug analogs act, this being an analog of other now scheduled drugs (i.e. 5-MeO-DiPT). Appreciate the hostility as I try and help though!&nbsp;
