				Hi there,<br />I have been planning to do my first LSD trip soon, mostly due to the fact its one of the less toxic drugs out there, and an idea occurred to me that LSD would be the best thing to try now since I have some health issues atm. (chemotherapy)<br /><br />I have done mushrooms few times by now, and every time I have smoked with it, it seemed to enhance and pro-long the trip nicely and it just fit in the right way. Due to my health issue I will no longer be able to smoke now, but I was thinking whether baking some hash cakes along with LSD would be a good mix?<br /><br />I really can&#039;t imagine being on a psychadelic comedown without being buzzed off weed, I would trip out and by the end or mid way through I would start smoking. I still feel LSD might not be the best thing to take but I can&#039;t avoid bad trips, they are crucial too and I believe I could handle one even with my current emotional state. (ofc with a sitter)<br /><br />So yeah weed with LSD is good or bad? Should I just use benzo&#039;s to fall asleep instead? Or drink? Thanks

				I wouldn&#039;t advise it, friendo. Its not like shrooms. The only time i can see it being a good idea would be at the very end of the trip when you&#039;re already in that restful peaceful state, reflecting on the day&#039;s experience. I would use it to help me fall asleep since acid tends to keep you up after a long day of tripping. Ultimately its up to you, but i wouldn&#039;t advise smoking during the come up or peak at least.<br /><br /><br />Be safe<br /><br />Shifty

				I&#039;d munch that hash brownie about 3 hours into your trip (adjusting the time according to how much you dosed and when you reach your peak) -- I&#039;d also prefer an indica strain for the body buzz since I am prone to scatter thought already.<br /><br />Drinking is take or leave when I am on psychedelics. Sometimes it tastes like poison and I can &quot;feel&quot; it being churned by my liver and drowning my brain while other times it&#039;s the perfect mix of elation and refreshment. Regardless; I prefer hard Apple Ciders (Woodchuck, Hornsby, Angry Orchard) over domestic beer or micro brews. <br /><br />You can use benzos as the easy off switch, but I don&#039;t like Big Pharma so my silent protest is to refrain from taking any and all forms of Company manufactured drugs. <br /><br />If you want a precursor that will take away a any trip anxiety; you can try looking for a Beta Blocker like Propanolol(sp?) -- It&#039;s what performers, public speakers, musicians take to alleviate and prevent Stage Fright. It is very non intrusive mentally wise with little to no hangover/comedown/side effects.<br />

				Weed will amplify the trip, which is why I smoke it. It can lead to a strange sense of disassociation and if there&#039;s enough LSD in you, you can experience complete ego-death (you would look like you&#039;re asleep), then you come back and have to learn everything again but it takes minutes and not a lifetime. Smoking towards the end might actually bring some of the effects back, but I&#039;ve slept like that myself. A benzo will put you to sleep at the end of a trip but it might kill the beautiful afterglow of the acid.

				Cool I will probably give it till the very end, or most likely just drop a benzo for sleep. I don&#039;t want to kill any of the trip, the reason I want to have a benzo is because I find it hard to fall asleep sober, and if LSD has an effect of keeping someone awake I will definitely need those at the end. Cheers though

				My friends and I burn the fuck out of our weed when we trip, regardless of what it is. You just have to understand:<br /><br />&quot;No, I don&#039;t think I need a hit right now.&quot;<br />&quot;Dude, if you still think it matters at this point you don&#039;t understand it yet.&quot;<br /><br />Weed can augment the trip in all sorts of ways, but it can&#039;t overpower it or bring it down unless you want.

				I have only taken LSD the once (x2 70ug tabs) and i had a joint just before i came up and then 2 more over the course of the trip (though i smoked the second 2 joints in 4 or 5 sittings).<br /><br />I took the first one so i would just to remove any nerves and to settle myself into the day (i had been in 2 minds whether or not to take the LSD as i had been suffering from some toothache) and it did just that. As for the second two i felt everytime i started to plateau or the trip would dip slightly, smoking a bit of weed brought me right back up, so for me it was a deffinate plus.<br /><br />I appreciate my dose of LSD wasn&#039;t very high (especially as im a big guy) and maybe on higher doses it may not act so well as a compliment, but if i dropped again i think id definitely have myself a couple of joints for the ride.<br /><br />Hope this helps ! =)

				Person preference if you ask me. Weed always makes any psychedelic bad for me (gives me anxiety which easily leads to a bad trip) but I have friends that can&#039;t trip without smoking weed.

				In my experience, cannabis heightens the effects of other drugs including LSD. I find that the psychedelic headspace and the visuals are increased after smoking cannabis during the LSD peak, but it could be overwhelming for some people.

				Weed definitely enhances the trip for me as well, though I have a relatively low tolerance to weed so as I am coming up, I hit a bong to help me relax, then leave it for a couple hours. And hit the indica toward the end to help coming down and relaxing.

				Here are my 2 cents to the question: Weed and LSD mix together like they were meant for one another :P<br /><br />I&#039;m personally more experienced with LSD than Weed, and only really added weed during my last LSD trip - started smoking right at the peak of Lucy (as suggested by another SR member) and boy was he right. Although I was already high on Lucy, the weed simply transformed the experience x 10, me and my friend were literally at a different dimension, too smashed by the sheer awesomeness of the music to even communicate with one another. <br /><br />So yeah if you do Lucy and and you are feeling alright at its peak, I would suggest you go for it. Although inhaling is easy to control when the weed will hit you, while eating it means you won&#039;t know when weed will start interacting with LSD. So I would suggest, if possible, smoke or vaporise the weed for instant effects.

				I don&#039;t think I would ever take LSD if I didn&#039;t have some weed to accompany me on the trip.&nbsp; They go together like Bacon &amp; eggs.....or milk and cookies.&nbsp; &nbsp;Weed will always bring me back if things get too intense it seems.&nbsp; But to each his own.&nbsp; &nbsp;The setting is a very important part of taking LSD.&nbsp; That and the space inside your head too.&nbsp; Have fun!!!

				I didn&#039;t think this would ever happen, but this weekend I got too stoned while tripping. There was a period of time when I just laid there in the dark and it didn&#039;t feel like I was tripping. I will admit the acid was underwhelming. Maybe there is no such thing as getting too stoned if you take more acid. After the weed wore off a bit I started tripping again.

				I think Delta11 and NeuroRelativizer both made excellent and complimentary points. +1 to both of you. Neuro is right in that a lot of our reality (specifically our perception of it) is dictated by our own conscious decisions on what is &quot;true&quot; in the world. If you believe something is impossible for you, then it will be. If you believe all things are possible, then you open up the doors that let you make that attempt.<br /><br />This idea of our perspective is especially important for drugs. The more control you believe you have, the more control you are likely to have. However, Delta11 makes the point that it is important to acknowledge limits: no matter how hard you believe it is not likely you will fly through the air with a thought and you may not be able to defeat anxiety with just a thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, these are times when you can acknowledge the weakness and use what&#039;s available to help overcome that weakness. Delta11 used/uses benzos to help manage his anxiety to the point where it sounds like he&#039;s on the road to being anxiety free (or anxiety less) without necessarily needing the benzos as much.<br /><br />Cheers and enjoy my friend. I hope your experience turned/turns out well!<br /><br />

I take xanax to relieve my of my anxiety but I have a friend that smokes weed to relieve his anxiety. Smoking weed triggers my anxiety so I can&#039;t do it anymore (ironic I know) but I love the cannabis culture, I think it&#039;s the best drug culture of them all&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I don&#039;t like mixing my psychedelics but there are people that love mixing them (LSD+Shrooms+Weed).&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I like both but weed only helps me unwind a bit. It&#039;s relaxing to a certain degree. If I&#039;ve reached a certain level of anxiety though, then weed doesn&#039;t really help. Benzos however, benzos are lovely for making the world an easier place to deal with and I think it&#039;s great SR is here to keep supplies available for all people to manage anxiety issues. <br /><br />Because seriously, the feeling that comes from massive amounts of anxiety is awful and can really ruin somebody&#039;s life. I don&#039;t think someone should have to deal with that kind of distress just because big pharm refuses to let people enjoy nice drugs.<br /><br />Cheers

				When I did Lucy, I&#039;d always take Xanax going up and coming down. I would occasionally smoke some bud, but not more then a hit or so. I&#039;d be too lost in my trip to really care to smoke.
