				<br />Welcome to the angry thread where you&#039;re invited to vent a spleen at things that insense, enrage or annoy you. No rules, no holds barred, just fire away. I think you&#039;ll find it therapeutic......<br /><br />+ 1 to anyone who makes me smile.......

				What makes me angry? Greed.<br /><br />Greed as in vendors price fixing to squeeze more money from customers when they are already making good profits.<br /><br />Greed as in vendors making up to and over 1000% profit margins.<br /><br />People who take advantage of others generosity, like when buyers FE and get sent nothing but a false tracking number.

				Anyone who honestly thanks god for curing them of the cancer he gave them.<br /><br />I want to punch those people in their throats just to shut them up.<br /><br />People that name their miscarried babies and then talk about them like they were real live people. I don&#039;t go naming my shits and celebrating their birthdays. Get over it.<br /><br />The entire series of Lost. I want my time back. You guys fucked me. We all knew you were dead the second the plane crashed but you kept stringing us along for years. I hate you so much I want to give your lungs to homeless people.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating on Avatar... I waited like two freaking hours to see those giant smurfs fuck and I got nothing but a little pre-teen grope fest out of the deal. Fuck you James Cameron!<br /><br />Tellers who ask me how my day is and want to strike up a conversation after I waited 15 minutes in line to get to them! If you would just shut the fuck up and take my deposit my day would be a lot better because I didn&#039;t have to waste so much of it in here while you pretend to give a shit about the guy in front of me&#039;s new freaking car he is buying for his niece. <br /><br />Waiting for drugs. I get it, the regular postal service is cheaper and easier but I want my fucking drugs delivered by rocket ship not a tuna boat. Will you folks please find a nearby Fed-Ex drop box and get me my freaking fix!

				&quot;Well, fuck you, too. Fuck me, fuck you, fuck this whole city and everyone in it. Fuck the panhandlers, grubbing for money, and smiling at me behind my back. Fuck the squeegee men dirtying up the clean windshield of my car. Get a fucking job! Fuck the Sikhs and the Pakistanis bombing down the avenues in decrepit cabs, curry steaming out their pores, stinking up my day. Terrorists in fucking training. SLOW THE FUCK DOWN! Fuck the Chelsea boys with their waxed chests and pumped up biceps. Going down on each other in my parks and on my piers, jingling their dicks on my Channel 35. Fuck the Korean grocers with their pyramids of overpriced fruit and their tulips and roses wrapped in plastic. Ten years in the country, still no speaky English? Fuck the Russians in Brighton Beach. Mobster thugs sitting in cafés, sipping tea in little glasses, sugar cubes between their teeth. Wheelin&#039; and dealin&#039; and schemin&#039;. Go back where you fucking came from! Fuck the black-hatted Chassidim, strolling up and down 47th street in their dirty gabardine with their dandruff. Selling South African apartheid diamonds! Fuck the Wall Street brokers. Self-styled masters of the universe. Michael Douglas, Gordon Gekko wannabe motherfuckers, figuring out new ways to rob hard working people blind. Send those Enron assholes to jail for FUCKING LIFE! You think Bush and Cheney didn&#039;t know about that shit? Give me a fucking break! Tyco! Worldcom! Fuck the Puerto Ricans. Twenty to a car, swelling up the welfare rolls, worst fuckin&#039; parade in the city. And don&#039;t even get me started on the Dom-in-i-cans, &#039;cause they make the Puerto Ricans look good. Fuck the Bensonhurst Italians with their pomaded hair, their nylon warm-up suits, their St. Anthony medallions, swinging their, Jason Giambi, Louisville slugger, baseball bats, trying to audition for the Sopranos. Fuck the Upper East Side wives with their Hermes scarves and their fifty-dollar Balducci artichokes. Overfed faces getting pulled and lifted and stretched, all taut and shiny. You&#039;re not fooling anybody, sweetheart! Fuck the uptown brothers. They never pass the ball, they don&#039;t want to play defense, they take five steps on every lay-up to the hoop. And then they want to turn around and blame everything on the white man. Slavery ended 137 years ago. Move the fuck on! Fuck the corrupt cops with their anus violating plungers and their 41 shots, standing behind a blue wall of silence. You betray our trust! Fuck the priests who put their hands down some innocent child&#039;s pants. Fuck the church that protects them, delivering us into evil. And while you&#039;re at it, fuck JC! He got off easy! A day on the cross, a weekend in hell, and all the hallelujahs of the legioned angels for eternity! Try seven years in fuckin&#039; Otisville, J! Fuck Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and backward-ass, cave-dwelling, fundamentalist assholes everywhere. On the names of innocent thousands murdered, I pray you spend the rest of eternity with your seventy-two whores roasting in a jet-fuel fire in hell. You towel headed camel jockeys can kiss my royal Irish ass! Fuck Jacob Elinsky, whining malcontent. Fuck Francis Xavier Slaughtery my best friend, judging me while he stares at my girlfriend&#039;s ass. Fuck Naturelle Riviera, I gave her my trust and she stabbed me in the back, sold me up the river, fucking bitch. Fuck my father with his endless grief, standing behind that bar sipping on club sodas, selling whisky to firemen, cheering the Bronx bombers. Fuck this whole city and everyone in it. From the row-houses of Astoria to the penthouses on Park Avenue, from the projects in the Bronx to the lofts in Soho. From the tenements in Alphabet City to the brownstones in Park slope to the split-levels in Staten Island. Let an earthquake crumble it, let the fires rage, let it burn to fucking ash and then let the waters rise and submerge this whole rat-infested place . . . No. No, fuck you, Montgomery Brogan. You had it all, and you threw it away, you dumb fuck!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;:-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-*

				What gets me fucking pissed is seeing all of the stupid brainwashed Americans every fucking day. You stupid people are so fucking self centered you never think of anything, but your own fucking selves. You never take a second to think about anything, but the day to day. Fuck the whole world. You live your little insignificant piece of shit lives and then what?? YOU FUCKING DIE. <br />Everyone needs to live life. Not be a slave to money. The American dream is just a fucked up means to an end.<br /><br /><br />Oh and I was talking to this bitch at a bar the other night and she was telling me how weed causes cancer and even the first time you smoke it creates a small tumor. I wanted to punch this fucking stupid ignorant bitch in the face. Of coarse I didn&#039;t. I held my composure and just said, &quot;oh yeah, well I sell crystal meth to children.&quot; And walked away.
