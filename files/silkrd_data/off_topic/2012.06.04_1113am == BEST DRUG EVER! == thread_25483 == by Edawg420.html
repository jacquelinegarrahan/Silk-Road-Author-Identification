				First of all i would like to say i have tried pretty much everything except crystal meth.&nbsp; &nbsp;If there is anything i should try please let me know in the thread.<br /><br />I had recently stumbled across the silk road a mere 2-3 months ago.&nbsp; At first i was like a kid in the candy store, all my favorite drugs at my figure tips!&nbsp; Unfortunately i was scammed by the big T76 for all that remembers his bitch ass but none the less i gave the SR another chance.<br /><br />I wanted LSD only because i am 27 years old and i have NEVER found it.&nbsp; I made a few purchases and soon after I found some good hits.&nbsp; It was fun but not what i was looking for.<br /><br />Not more then a week, as if the universe stopped and showed me the way i saw a documentary of DMT on Netflix.&nbsp; It&#039;s an amazing documentary, and i would suggest it to anybody.&nbsp; Its called DMT: The Spirit Molecule.&nbsp; After watching it i was sold completely and had to make a purchase.<br /><br />Folks, and fellow readers, if you haven&#039;t tried DMT.... You need to.... it was the most amazing and profound experience i have ever seen/felt/experienced.&nbsp; It changes every time i do it and i can&#039;t get enough.&nbsp; I used to not be a believer in supernatural, but by god i do now.<br /><br />I am a little shaken up right now as i have just ventured back from another reality, but if you take anything from this post, DMT will only create a better understanding for yourself.

				DMT: The Spirit Molecule is a terrible documentary, I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone! It was as awful as the television show Ancient Aliens.

				yep, dmt is easily the most powerful naturally occurring psychedelic. makes sense since it so closely resembles serotonin, and is said to be endogenous to pretty much all life. i love psilocybin as well, and can feel the similarities between the two.

				DMT is definitely the best shit ever, since not only does it grant you the greatest euphoria and visions but it is also non addictive and causes no physical harm whatsoever. It&#039;s a win-win in every regard!

				Never tried DMT, ordered 2 weeks ago from DiMiTrispice the big combo package.&nbsp; <br /><br />nervous and excited! <br /><br />I will say i was interested in DMT, what it offers and all ive read from forums and stuff (including the documentary, which was poorly produced though, seriously, shit documentary, regardless of the awesome facts, horribly presented)<br /><br />so yeah, if anyone can add more to this drug id love to hear it! <br /><br />SUGGESTIONS/ENVIRONMENT/ETC<br /><br />i will be getting it any day now<br /><br />BONER

				DMT pretty much is but it&#039;s intensity is marked down for it&#039;s short duration. Aya or pharmahauasca next for me. Then some LSD, then some more 2C-X&#039;s then some NBOMes. Not necessarily in that order. Moar mescaline will probably come first of all.

				If you can&#039;t handle the taste then try ayahuasca/pharmahuasca. if you take enough it is the same trip but waaaaay longer (3-6 hours)

				One of my other main problems on it was the smoking it on weed.&nbsp; I can&#039;t stand smoking lots of weed.&nbsp; I&#039;m cool with one or two hits, but when I smoked the DMT on weed they kept telling me to take more bong hits.&nbsp; I fucking hate getting totally baked.<br /><br />I see 5-meo-dmt requires a much smaller dose, I heard it was far more powerful, who has smoked both?&nbsp; <br /><br />How is the taste of the smoke?<br /><br />How is it to eat or snort?&nbsp; Ir ead it was active that way too.<br />

				It&#039;s only the bliss of things man. You&#039;ll never have that first weed experience back again or that first line of cocaine or that first time you tripped on acid or that first big hit of free base coke. It&#039;s like that first time you have intercourse. Maybe that&#039;s a bad example because sex is always bliss hahaha

				If your asking those kind of questions. I would seriously consider just sticking with n,n,DMT because 5-Meo-DMT is truly a beast. often called the wicked cousin of n,n,DMT.<br />It has much more of a body load and although potent, it is not as easily enjoyable. kind of like pure salvia extract.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents
