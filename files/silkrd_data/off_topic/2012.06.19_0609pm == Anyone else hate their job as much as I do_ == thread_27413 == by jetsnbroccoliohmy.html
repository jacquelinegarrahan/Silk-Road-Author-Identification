				Adderall, I hate work without it. On it, the intolerable are tolerable, the day goes by faster, and my productivity skyrockets. Just don&#039;t abuse it like others do, then it becomes useless. I take half of a 30mg each morning and never more, have been for several years and I haven&#039;t built up a tolerance, I don&#039;t have a dependence, and I never take it on weekends.

				Yes i hate my current job in information technologies, but this is because I&#039;m sick of the bad administration where i work. I am searching for a better job but i don&#039;t know if i really want to continue in that sector for a very long time, clients are crazy all the time.. I&#039;m thinking about going to university in a couple of years to learn chemistry and to work in pharmaceutical laboratories, but lack of money is what stopping me right now..

				Sorry to hear about you fellas being unemployed.&nbsp; I guess living in one of the biggest cities in the US helps as there are plentiful jobs.&nbsp; I am currently looking to switch industries, but that means starting over and entry level pay aka I need to get a new place to live as I won&#039;t be able to afford my current living situation.&nbsp; Having my masters degree helps, but having poor parents and over $1000 a month in student loans blows as well.&nbsp; I need some MDMA to cheer me up, I wish PF would reup!&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as being in IT....ilovelsd69, we abuse our poor IT guys.&nbsp; Whenever our system goes down he gets bashed, and it seems like it goes down a lot.&nbsp; Completely understand how you feel

				- unfortunately the couldnt give a shit about the next man, less opportunities, more money grabbing, rich getting richer, general laziness and<br />&nbsp; attitude means MOST jobs are not worth waking up in the morning for, its seems to be quite rare and few examples where someone has a<br />&nbsp; nice balance between work environment, job satisfaction and salary ..for example.<br /><br />- its real difficult explaining these sorts of lessons and how the world is, the path to take in life to kids; you want to tell how the world really works<br />&nbsp; and what they ought to do or the positive side but without lying to them?! (when you know in the back of your mind you can put as much<br />&nbsp; effort into things someones no doubt going to trash it)<br />&nbsp; kids are supposed to work it out for themselves, what would you rather have -they are over protected, naive or the other extreme fully aware<br />&nbsp; of what to expect -is a difficult balance.<br /><br />peace<br />

				I usually work some pretty crazy shifts/hours but the bonus is that I usually get the same amount of time off as I work. Sounds good, but I find I learn a job and then get bored. At that stage now. Am looking for that dream job that I will love, but been looking for a while now.

				...some unexpected ideas/posts, thats quite true, what your &quot;official&quot; job is from 9-5 and the other sources of income as those playing <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;quite an active role in SR paints a very different picture of who you are today versus the old fashioned concept you study x and get that job<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;related to what you studied, and retire 40yrs later (whatever).<br /><br /><br /><br />TWM<br />

				My advice? Stop now. Do something you wanna do. Honestly idk why you put all that time into education if you hate the end result. GRANTED&nbsp; masters education is great enrichment for a human being&#039;s intelligence in general, but as far as its compatibility with your life, doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s done more than put you in a job that pisses you off and generally makes you feel like shit. I was exactly the same way in school, and am really tryin to get over it to properly educate myself, but some things just aren&#039;t for some people. Perhaps the professional life just isn&#039;t for you. <br /><br />There&#039;s so few defining moments in life, and a man&#039;s perception of his own worth is staked upon them (I give a fuck if you&#039;re a girl, man is a general term). The best thing you can do for yourself is to have some damn conviction about whatever it is you decide to do and do it.<br /><br />Much love.<br />~HH
