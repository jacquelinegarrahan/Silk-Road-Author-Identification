				I would choose a lot of interesting people with different backgrounds. Status doesn&#039;t matter. Only the fact that they are open-minded and willing to share their philosophy of life. <br /><br />DPR could be interesting to meet. Sit with him at cafe table, pass thought&#039;s and ideas and then walk different ways.

				Had quite a few women who I&#039;ve lost due the fact that they simply could not handle the drugs anymore. Love of my life though she was awesome about it all and would always join me. I find it hard to date women that dont do drugs since its like dealing with a child. You have nothing they can relate to since my whole life has been drugs and the fun times on them.
