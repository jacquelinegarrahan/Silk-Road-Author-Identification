				I would like to thank a fellow traveler for a small loan they have given me. Last week, I was a bit short, and pt word on another post about wanting a small loan. Later in the day, I noticed it had arrived, but had already ordered elsewhere, so I returned the loan, with just a small amount of interest, and a thank you in a PM. <br />Tonight, the same person has made it possible for me to make an order, in which I am getting one hell of a deal, and didn&#039;t want to miss out on it. Although it was just a very small loan, I wanted to profess my appreciation. I have friends in RL who wouldn&#039;t budge off of 3usd to save your life, and here&#039;s a total stranger helping me out. So I just wanted to post about it. <br />I won&#039;t name the person, to keep em private, and to keep em from getting 1K of PMs asking for loans!. It&#039;s up to them if they want y&#039;all to know how fucking cool they are. <br />Another traveler also offered to loan me 1BTC, but I had already received my loan. <br />I just think it&#039;s cool as hell that a stranger would help me out. Even though it&#039;s just a couple bucks, I could easily just not pay it back, and while not a huge loss, being jipped pisses anyone off. <br />Peace to all,<br />SD
