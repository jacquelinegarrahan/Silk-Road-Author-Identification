				I can&#039;t drink alcohol (basically I just skip any pleasant feelings and go straight to a hangover), so I take a low dose of MDMA maybe once a week or once every two weeks when I go out with friends. The problem is that a low dose to me is about 300mg, even from vendors like aakoven who get rave reviews. This basically just gives me a mild body high and a bit of euphoria. A dose to really make me roll is probably around 500mg. I&#039;ve been taking it regularly like this off and on for maybe a year, and have probably done pills/mdma 30-40ish times over the course of 5-6 years before that.<br /><br />&nbsp;I guess I was just kind of curious to see if there are any other frequent users who experience the same tolerance, and if people might recommend a good substitute for the mdma because my tolerance is naturally just increasing. When I go out I just like the MDMA cause it makes me more social, and of course I like the physical feeling of it too, so if there is something that could have a similar effect, then I would be open to it. <br /><br />FYI I&#039;ve done coke once and it did absolutely nothing for me. We were doing lines all night and everyone else was having fun, but not me and my other friend (who actually also has a very similar tolerance to MDMA but from far less usage).&nbsp;

				Well I would also be quite interested in the opinions of the more experienced users out there&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I for one would say that you could try 2C-B, BUT as I myself discovered this &quot;new substance&quot; just a few weeks ago&nbsp; ;D take it with a BIG grain of salt&nbsp; ???<br />However, from what I tried, If you would take just a little bit orally (just like MDMA) its effects where quite similar...<br />So far I tried it only 2 times. The first time just a little bit orally (i have no idea how much, but it was really a little. May be 10mg, may be even less) and I felt really like a nice light MDMA &quot;roll&quot;.<br />The second time I took about 25mg snorted, and... WOW. Don&#039;t try that if you are not experienced with LSD!!! It was completely different and waaaay more trippy than I had imagined it would be from the first experience! Very Fun, but probably not what you are after :P<br /><br />Now the question remains if 2C-B and MDMA are &quot;compatible&quot;. Meaning if you take one time MDMA and next time 2C-B will it help with your high MDMA tolerance, that I do not know and will hopefully let some more experience take it from here&nbsp; ::)

				when first introduced to molly it appears that the caps were laced. i am assuming that it was methylone and 2-cb or some other 2c type substance. ill be trying 2-ce if it ever gets here and ill know if it was it or not. i didnt think before i ordered but 2cb sounds more like it. ill update hopefully tomorrow night about this but the &quot;molly&quot; i used to get was fucktastic and nothing compares... i wont be trying with m1 sadly but imagine take some mdma and as it peaks even if it not strong hit a can of air duster. only lasts a minute or so but rocks my cock like nothing ever has. cept that molly from long time ago. and i could take 2 a day or more and itd beat my fucking ass man. so im hoping it to be a 2c chem. good luck

Take l trytophan on any days the comedown becomes to much. Now in regards to your other question a good substitute would be 2c-b or maybe some methalone. Nothing can ever really come close to molly though so make sure you take a break and eat all those vitamins so your back to normal for next time

				I&#039;ve heard about this from many people, and from what I understand, if you take a 2 or 3 month break from the MDMA your tolerance will drop back down.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re a weed smoker at all, but if you are then you should try smoking some hash oil (aka budder aka wax) before you go out.&nbsp; I find it to be quite an uplifting high.<br /><br />You&#039;re in a somewhat dangerous place though...&nbsp; lots of people who start to lose the magic of MDMA turn to crystal meth because it keeps you up and makes you talkative &amp; social, but its a fucking demon man.&nbsp; STAY AWAY!&nbsp; you&#039;ll think its great at first, but give it a couple months and you&#039;ll be changing your tune to regret for having ever tried that vile shite.<br /><br />and don&#039;t listen to that guy who told you to take 2C-B....that just sounds ignorant.&nbsp; it will make you trip in a weird way and won&#039;t give you the social buzz you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />my advice: take some time off and then go back to small doses of molly.&nbsp; <br /><br />or drink champagne&nbsp; :D

However, mushrooms/4-ACO are also quite empathogenic.<br /><br />MDMA leaves me feeling like shit for a good week. It really isn&#039;t something I care to do more than SUPER occasionaly. Why don&#039;t you try more meaningful and less harmful psychedelics such as 25I, 4-ACO/Mushrooms, LSD, DMT, etc

				these people are 100% correct... the crave never goes away... ever... you will do stupid shit for it too... from attempts at cooking to stealing... then youll find that NO ONE else is close to as understanding as you... invite a date, or your new co worker over and pull a twacked out light bulb filled with meth and see what they think about it lol... if you ever want to buy it just to buy it... send it to me lol :o

				You need a break from MDMA.<br /><br />You&#039;ll regret not taking a break if you keep doing what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Nothing will take MDMA&#039;s place for you. You just need to take a few months off. <br /><br />Hopefully you don&#039;t encounter the mood swings, depression, and anxiety that I did when I abused the shit out of MDMA. <br /><br />Your brain needs a break.
