				Does anybody know if SR has an &#039;official&#039; clearnet site with it&#039;s status like they used to? I found dozens of sites claiming to be the official gateway but they appear to be transparent scams

				If there were a MAJOR issue affecting SR I assume SR Staff would msg the vendors directly unless something happened to the staff then forums would be the only backup....<br /><br />kinda scary...

				As long as you keep pgp keys of all the trusted vendors you might buy from and maybe all the public pgp keys people have posted. I guess we could all chat using pidgin and buy using email if everything went down.&nbsp; :-\

				In my opinion the forums are much more important, because they can inform people about a new site, communication can continue, as well as sales (just less convenient). Older vendors would still do private selling by email, but new vendors would have difficulty getting off the ground to get feedback and trust since the lack of an escrow system.

				Good question.<br /><br />When I first heard of the Road, first thing I did was find the forum.&nbsp; Forums are the best source of real time info on any given topic.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t have gone near the road if not for the information, including the REAL login page, which I found here.&nbsp; It&#039;s how I determined that Silk Road was legit...

				Umm wouldn&#039;t it be easier to rebuild the forums than the SR market place? I mean sure you would lose all the reviews which are important to read. And the tips and tricks of Using SR are important too. But some stuff on here is rather kind of &quot;catch up&quot; day to day stuff. And some things could be reposted on another newer forum site. I think the marketplace going down would have a bigger impact IMHO.

				i don&#039;t know it would suck to loose the market but i&#039;m sure they have back ups of the site, maybe not with the listings but the framework at least. if the forum was lost all the posting and info might go with it

Without them I would have taken 100 times longer to do 1/10th as much. The forums showed me what people want, how to spin my wares, the best advertisement strategy, the need for sampling, the possibility of alternate avenues of communication, the possibility of custom .onion portfolios and methods to fund the vending account.<br /><br />&nbsp;The forums are absolutely critical. Without them I would probably have wound up trying to be a vendor and failing. With them.. I&#039;m sure to succeed.. the only question is.. how MUCH success will I have.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thank you to the forum admins and tech folks. Muchas gracias!
