				Hey everybody!<br /><br />This is my first day on silk road and I just got started with bicoins but its good to have a use for TOR since I stopped being a script kiddie hacker in highschool. I hope no one is pissed off I made a new topic to introduce myself but I wanted to actually meet some people. Mostly just wanted to ask a couple questions for my own peace of mind.<br /><br />How do I keep my bitcoin ids safe? I know I get a wallet on here but I dont want to transfer straight from my main wallet to here, any easy ways to bounce it around a few times before landing here?<br /><br />What kind of delivery times can I expect? Mostly looking for mushrooms as I only smoke weed (errrrvry day) and do hallucinogens. Weed I can find everywhere but mushrooms are always a bitch. So how long would you guys expect to wait for a qtr of mushrooms to arrive?<br /><br />Thanks and again, not just bitcoins but this whole network of things that are pulling together is awesome.

				Dont trip about bitcoins being sent directory to your SR wallet. It&#039;s how i have bought them an haven&#039;t had an issues.<br /><br />As far as shipping times it really depends on where you live compared to the vendors residence. Mushies i would asume would be sent at the very least a large thick envelope. I received a small amount of powder through such an envelope to a very secure area in the USA (To stupid to figure it out? dont fucking ask.) Max? 3 weeks. Min?(same amount sent different vender) 3 days. Same amount of product. Sent nearly identical ways.<br /><br />Order domestic? Get drugs sent to your fucking doorstep.<br /><br />You cant beat it.

				If you are using Mt. Gox to get your coins, never try to access it from Tor, they will flag your account and you will lose whatever money is in it. Also if you are using mt. gox send your coins to instawallet or some other equivalent before sending them here. <br /><br />Should definitely check out galindoi&#039;s capsules for shrooms. Cheap, quick and very discreet shipping and you&#039;ll definitely have a good time.

				Cool, thanks for the advice on Mt. Gox. I mostly just mine and invest in GLBSE, if anything I buy from OTC so no worries there. I am still a bit paranoid(a good bit of paranoia is healthy) about sending my coins straight to my SR account.
