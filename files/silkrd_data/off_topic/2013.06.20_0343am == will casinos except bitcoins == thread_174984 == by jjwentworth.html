				wouldnt it be nice if casinos started excepting bitcoins? does anybody think that will ever happen and if so how long before you think it would? it would be a perfect way to turn bits into cash although i would imagine there would be safeguards in place to avoid money laundering. but how cool would it be if you could sit down at a slot machine type in how many bits you want to transfer into that slot and start playing.

				There is a sportbet site that only take BTC and I use it a lot.<br /><br />The odds are spot on with the big boys and they pay out as soon as the event is over.<br /><br />

				do they pay u back in cash or bitcoins? my point being was if you could physically walk into a casino and use your bitcoins and walk out with cash. not really to gamble and have the same problem you had when you started which was having bitcoins you were looking to cash in. <br /><br />i guess i made it sound like i would want to gamble when in reality i was hoping for an easy way to convert bits into cash. i already knew bout the online casinos
