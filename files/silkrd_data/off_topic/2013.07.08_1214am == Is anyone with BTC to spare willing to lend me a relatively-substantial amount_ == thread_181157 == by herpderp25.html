				First off, here are my credentials as a buyer on the site. Any mod/admin can verify.<br /><br />SR Name: buba1990<br /><br />Member for: 1 year<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all time<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;113 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿1.6071 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿17.0980 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿441.0600 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿449.9400<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br /><br />Reason I am asking here and not in the spare coin thread is because this is more of a loan with interest and a guaranteed time-frame. <br />The exact amount I am requesting is 2.7 BTC, which comes out to $199.69. USD. We&#039;ll call it 200 for simplicity&#039;s sake. <br /><br />So my proposition is you lend me 2.7 BTC, sent straight to my account and within 4 weeks (August 7) or earlier, I will return your 200 along with an extra 50 dollars worth directly back to your account. 25% profit margin for anyone who loans (all I need is ONE and limit ONE) and I am giving it a guaranteed delivery date. My user stats above should show something about how I conduct my business on this site. You may also feel free to go into the Spare Coins thread and see that I have loaned and been loaned at least 4 times I can recall off the top of my head, all successful, paid on time, and with said interest. <br /><br />But when we get to the bottom of it, this is an internet forum and SR is the site. There are scammers, and I understand its hard to delve into something like this (I got scammed out of 280 on a MoneyPak conversion back in the day, so I know how that stings), but I am going purely on the honor system and promising that I will follow through on my end and deliver everything in the conditions and timeframe stated above. <br /><br />If one would be so generous as to actually help me out with this loan, I would really be appreciative of the gesture and make sure to give them a nice bonus on top of the 25%, just for having faith. <br /><br />So, please read it over, and if anyone is okay with this, my SR username is buba1990<br /><br />I really hope someone can help me, but if people don&#039;t want to, I understand completely, so no hard feelings whatsoever. Thank&nbsp; you as well for your time, peace!

				Also, a loan of 1.7 would also work. 1.7 = ~$132, so you would receive $170 even, which is slightly more than 25%. If someone feels more comfortable with this smaller amount, please let me know ASAP, or feel free to send to my account on SR named buba1990 and PM me on there right after.<br /><br />As I said above, this is all on scout&#039;s honor&nbsp; system. I am an honest guy and if someone would be so kind and help me during this time of need for me, i&#039;ll gladly repay it in a timely fashion, with generous interest, and if you don&#039;t have your money back by that time, I fully authorize my account to be banned, as well as this one to be blacklisted. But that won&#039;t happen.

				And last thing I forgot to mention-- I WILL hedge the money out. So if your BTC you loan me today deflates in value over that month, i&#039;ll send you back the payment in the equivalent dollar amount to reflect the change in the BTC market.

				Also, this isn&#039;t anything too urgent, so if in a few hours I get no takers or no replies, i&#039;ll delete the thread. Thanks for reading and considering to everyone though!

				If you still wish a loan then PM me.<br />Providing you have an honest reputation which is verifiable, im sure we could help out.<br /><br />P.S. - Just a tip, I personally think it a bad idea to post your spend stats publicly, especially when they are actually pretty low in the scheme of things. Just makes your username a bigger target for feds- most big spenders also know this so never post their stats publicly, meaning if an intruding cop see&#039;s your post they might think you to be a &#039;big player&#039; and put some effort in to watching you. I can assure you that you are by no means even an average spendor but as I say, most other bigger spendors keep these things hush.<br />Not getting on at you buddy, just a tip.<br />If I can help you out with BTC then hit me up.
