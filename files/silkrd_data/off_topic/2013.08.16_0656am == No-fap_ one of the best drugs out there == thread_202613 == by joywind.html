				&quot;What happens when you drop a male rat into a cage with a receptive female rat? First, you see a frenzy of copulation. Then, progressively, the male tires of that particular female. Even if she wants more, he has had enough. However, replace the original female with a fresh one, and the male immediately revives and gallantly struggles to fertilize her.&quot;<br /><br /><br />^ That&#039;s what is happening to you when you constantly watch porn. Every click of the mouse is another female that you mentally mated. Repeat this for 10 videos, 10 partners ... and all of a sudden you have no urge/motivation to pass on your genes via clappping real cheeks.<br /><br />Stop masturbating, stop watching porn -- once you break through the two week hurdle you begin to feel like superman, it&#039;s absolutely amazing. It&#039;s like amphetamine without the come down.<br /><br />More energy, more confidence, better at everything you do, more alert to the little things in life and overall always in a better mood.<br /><br />You literally become the best possible version of yourself.<br /><br />Try it yourself. Stop wanking for a month. Stop watching pornography.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Originally Posted by yourbrainonporn.com<br />For you, rats, and all mammals, the desire to have sex arises from a neurochemical called dopamine. Dopamine amps up the centerpiece of the primitive part of the brain—the reward circuitry. It’s where we experience pleasure, and where we get addicted.<br /><br />The ancient reward circuitry compels you to do things that further your survival and pass on your genes. At the top of our human reward list are food, sex, love, friendship, and novelty. These are called ‘natural reinforcers,’ as opposed to addictive chemicals.<br /><br />The evolutionary purpose of dopamine is to motivate you to do what your genes want you to. The bigger the squirt the more you want something. No dopamine and you just ignore it. Chocolate cake and ice cream—a big blast. Celery—not so much. Sex and orgasm are the biggest natural blast of dopamine available to your reward circuitry. One of dopamine&#039;s nicknames is the &quot;molecule of addiction.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://yourbrainonporn.com/doing-what-you-evolved-to-do<br /><br />ere&#039;s a personal account of this guy&#039;s No Fap journey/transformation:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Day 1<br /><br />...Today was my first day of no PMO.<br /><br />I have been masturbating since 15/16 years old. I have been watching porn since 3/4 grade. I am 23 years old.<br /><br />I didnt really think I had an addiction till someone posted the yourbrainonporn.com link on a forum I frequent. Porn has always just kind of been there...<br /><br />Day 12<br /><br />...I went to the library two days ago and approached two girls. I never do that unless I&#039;m at the club. Even then it takes a lot effort for me to do it. The first one I got her number (she was really cute and had a really kind personality) and the second one had a serious boyfriend but she was still flirting with me the entire time. I don&#039;t know what came over me. I saw them, got up from the computer desk, and approached them like it was second nature. When I finished talking to them, I have to admit I felt really proud of myself and happy. It was a huge adrenaline rush lol....<br /><br />I have also been really introspective. Normally when I am around women I feel intimidated or looking for one that will give me attention or I will look for one that is down to do the dirty. So basically I used to have three categories of experience with woman-<br />1. Who is down to do some things? If so, pleaasseee give me attention. You maybe? You? How about you?<br />2. Intimidation. I used to feel really intimidated by woman. I would feel weak and inadequate. Like I did not stack up to them.<br />3. I am a man and I am higher than you in a very a$$hole way.<br /><br />Now it&#039;s..........equal. I don&#039;t want anything from them. I am enjoying myself and just being me. I usually have to go to a doctors office and the woman staff there have been...dare I say it?....nicer to me. My voice is deeper and I have a more commanding presence. I feel separate from everyone elses drama.<br /><br />Day 43<br /><br />Hey guys, hope everyone is well.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been feeling great. The more I resist the urge to M the better I feel. For example, if I have a super horny night and resist it I wake up the next morning feeling amazing.<br /><br />~I have a lot more courage<br /><br />~I speak with a lot more clarity and control<br /><br />~People and their issues don&#039;t bother me as much. I just allow them to be who they are<br /><br />~I can hold eye contact with women<br /><br />~Men respect me more. This has been really noticeable<br /><br />~I feel like a man. Just this inner confidence...I feel like a rock<br /><br />~I am not as groggy when I wake up<br /><br />~I find myself meditating without even trying. I just go within and feel super great<br /><br />~I hardly get nervous about anything. Just relaxed confidence<br /><br />~My circle of friends and associates have been looking at me differently. Its like they can sense something different but they can&#039;t put their finger on it<br /><br />~My face looks brighter and I don&#039;t look as tired as I used to. I feel and look a lot more alert<br /><br />~Life feels more...real. There is a certain quality of it....</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				I dunno. I fuck my partner every day, fap at least twice more, I hit the gym once or twice a day for a gruelling cardio session - and I still have energy to dance around the place.<br /><br />If I stopped fapping I&#039;d be so strong only General Zod could stop me.

				Okey I have to admit this is really interesting! I think I am indeed addicted to M.<br /><br />I read this post earlier and seriously I have been thinking about this a lot and very serious. I don&#039;t believe though this thing about motivation. But I got really interested about the other things mentioned.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe I am actually thinking about it. Years and years has past and M is a daily habit. I am going to start a no-fap diary and maybe I will share it after days/weeks if I see any difference. <br /><br />But I have only one thought that makes me not really ready and I want your opinion.<br />All this &quot;practice&quot; all these years have made me a long lasting fucker (lol). But M always helped. If I know I am going to have sex at night I will M before some hours. Or even when I plan to go out I do it anyway just to be sure and &quot;ready&quot;.<br /><br />At the moment I am not involved in any relationship and it is a opportunity to try this no-fap thing. <br />I have one and half question for you people.<br /><br />1. If I happen to have sex after 10-20 days, do I get immediately back to the old stage?<br />1.5 I think I know the answer already just want your opinion. If after even some days of no M, I find myself ready to have sex then how long will I last? The way I know myself I would cum even before getting &quot;inside&quot;.<br /><br />So my plan is: Will start it from now. Will avoid any possible one night stands and will focus on one girl that I kind of like lately. If it doesn&#039;t work ok.&nbsp; If though I start feeling that we are going to have sex, I will keep my old routine and M some hours before. I can&#039;t go to war unprepared. I will be embarrassed if I cum after 1 minute. That&#039;s not me...<br /><br />Your thoughts. I am not trolling I talk very serious..<br /><br />All the best, and thanks for this info. I find it amazing!!<br /><br />Adamiz

				Here’s how: you have a primal, almost irresistible urge to procreate. That biological urge, when mixed with your testosterone, is intended to motivate you to jump out of bed in the morning ready to fight and fcuk your way through the herd, leaving vanquished foes and satiated hoes in your wake. Unfortunately, our advanced brains and opposable thumbs over time have discovered an almost perfect and flawless cheat: Masturbation. After all, it’s so much easier, so much less of a hassle, to simply cut all the corners, skip through the level, and polish that platinum trophy really fast until the end credits roll.<br /><br />Here’s where this wonderful thing we’re discovering called NoFap comes in: You, being the horny, over-sexed, perverted woman crazy fiend that you are, have a choice in how you get off.: Your hand or a vagina. You may feel like only one of those choices is viable, but that’s merely because it’s the EASY choice, so it appears to be the preferred one. Guess what: If you actually stop jerking off, and I mean STOP – eliminate it as a possibilty from your life (as I and many others have) – your sex starved brain and testicles will literally lead you out into the world and between the legs of a female. It just HAPPENS. Try it, you numbskull. You’ll see that I speak the truth.<br /><br />“But….but…, that’s easy for you to say but I have bad acne, back hair, a harelip, and my breath smells like a circus chimp’s used diaper!”<br /><br />Fine. Lower your standards and look again. The only reason your standards are so irrationally high in the first place is because of that damn computer screen you’ve been sitting in front of half your life. Hint: now that you’re no longer wasting your life in your comfy jerk-off chair, you will have plenty of time to apply Clearasil, shave your ape nape, and brush your teeth. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, THERE ARE REAL WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WILL HAVE SEX WITH YOU. They’re just waiting for you to poke your head into their personal space and say “Hello beautiful. You look bored. Can I help you with that?” Don’t believe me? Go to the Manga section at Barnes and Noble right now. There are three (3) nerdy girls on the floor at this very moment feeling lonely and unattractive, faces pressed into some crappy Japanese rape comic, dreaming of the day that someone like you comes along and says those exact words.<br /><br />Stop mentally objecting to the wisdom of what I’m saying and automatically trying to make yourself the exception to this absolute rule. You’re not different, you’re not unique, and you’re not a hopeless case. You’re a MAN, and mother nature wants your penis to hang out inside wet vaginas. PORN HAS BEEN COCKBLOCKING YOU FROM YOURSELF. SNAP OUT OF IT! Stop jerking off, and sex will happen to you. You will do it for yourself on an unconscious and biological level and you will literally marvel as it’s happening. And it will be FUN. Trust me, meeting and flirting with young women may be effort, but it sure as hell isn’t work.<br /><br />I’m speaking undeniable truth here.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing this now and it works so amazingly. You have so much energy, confidence, and drive. You are better at everything you do. Not just for women but for life itself. Fine you all can keep sedating yourselves. I&#039;ll be building my empire.

Sexual release reduces stress. The inability to achieve sexual release seems to exacerbate the stress of being in jail. People become obsessed with sexual stimuli. Not being able to see females except on TV makes them obsess over every female they see. I watched one of those prison shows and they described how the inmates jerked off to any little thing, like the top of a female guard&#039;s head. That doesn&#039;t seem healthy to me.<br /><br />By exposing yourself to sexual stimuli, like porn, you are desensitizing yourself to it, and making yourself more functional as a human being.

Dopamine is a key player, but so is serotonin, and in this case, testosterone. It&#039;s a bit off to narrow the effect down to just dopamine, if you ask me. <br /><br />That being said, I think porn is the real drainer. Orgasm is an intense physiological phenomenon but it&#039;s short lasted. Changes in neurotransmitter and hormone levels after masturbation and sex may be similar, but watching porn adds a significant layer of stimulation. <br /><br />Masturbating and watching porn certainly have an effect on a person&#039;s physiology and subsequently their moods. As with drugs, it will take some &quot;abuse&quot; to make the effects pronounced. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t been masturbating much in the past few months and I&#039;ve completely cut out porn. The effects are pretty drastic, and they seemed to exist whether or not I am having sex. I feel like I am engaging with women in a more intimately and personal way. My sex drive is very high but instead of seeing women as sex objects, I am more open to the subtleties of courtship and charm. It&#039;s no longer about just fucking her brains out as best I can. There&#039;s a whole process of hints and cues and learning each others sexual needs that I&#039;ve become keen to.<br /><br />To the guy who posted before, yes you may lose some stamina or control over your orgasms. They become a novelty after abstaining for awhile. Some women will really appreciate being able to build up a sexual relationship with you in this way, even if takes a few fucks. If you&#039;re just trying to slam some drunk college girls then maybe keep masturbating.. But there&#039;s a deeper more intimate sexual connection to be had if you refuse to fuck yourself!

				there is more going on here...<br /><br />dopamine is like the cocaine for the brain but there is also a more trapping chem from orgasms..&nbsp; pro-lactin.&nbsp; This is the heroin afterglow that is a great pain-reliever which can get you to forget all your other addictions and wash them away..&nbsp; <br /><br />and if you go to the mental side of sex..&nbsp; you can align any issue you have problems with to a fetish..&nbsp; different ones, for different issues.&nbsp; The biggest one, where it is really tough to break away, includes going into sub-space.&nbsp; And in that realm you can get to something that i dubbed &#039;sexual suicide&#039;<br /><br />this is where you get the same infinite release that one imagines you get from real suicide (the &#039;let go&#039;, never worry again) tied to your orgasms..&nbsp; the complete death of ego responsibility.. the broken ones you see on the bottom of the porn food chain<br /><br />you can do all that, over and over and over until the impulses of all your anxieties get sedated and then you can operate your non-sexual personality without any of that buildup..&nbsp; until it all builds up again from the issues in your life that you aren&#039;t dealing with..&nbsp; &nbsp;then once they build up again, maybe a trigger here or there in real life (rejection, humiliation, double standards, etc) then you rush to match up some fetishes to them and release again<br /><br />that cycle is stronger than any heroin addiction and it is completely free and in your hand and mind at all times....<br /><br />

				This topic reminds me of Dhat Syndrome.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In traditional Hindu spirituality, semen is described as a &quot;vital fluid&quot;. The discharge of this &quot;vital fluid&quot;, either through sex or masturbation, is associated with marked feelings of anxiety and dysphoria. Often the patient describes the loss of a whitish fluid while passing urine. At other times, marked feelings of guilt associated with what the patient assumes is &quot;excessive&quot; masturbation are noted.<br /><br />This is based on an old Hindu belief that it takes forty drops of blood to create a drop of bone marrow and forty drops of bone marrow to create a drop of sperm.<br /><br />Dhat is a folk diagnostic term used in India to refer to anxiety and hypochondriacal concerns associated with the discharge of semen, with discoloration of the urine, and feelings of weakness and exhaustion. This culture-bound syndrome is similar to jiryan (India), sukra prameha (Sri Lanka), and shen-k&#039;uei (China).<br /><br />Young males are most often affected, though similar symptoms have been reported in females with excessive vaginal discharge or leucorrhea, which is also considered a &quot;vital fluid&quot;.<br /><br />Premature ejaculation and impotence are commonly seen. Other somatic symptoms like weakness, easy fatiguability, palpitations, insomnia, low mood, guilt and anxiety are often present. Males sometimes report a subjective feeling that their penises have shortened. These symptoms are usually associated with an anxious and dysphoric mood state. The condition has no organic etiology.<br /><br />The term Dhat gets its origin from the Sanskrit word Dhatus, which, according to the Sushruta Samhita, means &quot;elixir that constitutes the body.&quot; <br /><br />Indian doctor Narendra Wig coined the term Dhat syndrome in 1960 and described it as being characterized by vague psychosomatic symptoms of fatigue, weakness, anxiety, loss of appetite, guilt, and sexual dysfunction, attributed by the patient to loss of semen in nocturnal emission, through urine or masturbation. <br /><br />Literature describing semen as a vital constituent of the human body dates back to 1500 BC. The disorders of Dhatus have been elucidated in the Charaka Samhita, which describes a disorder called Shukrameha in which there is a passage of semen in the urine. In China, various names such as (Shen K&#039;uei), Sri Lanka (Prameha) and other parts of South East Asia (Jiryan) symptoms and conditions are similar to dhatus.[1] The International Classification of diseases ICD-10 classifies Dhat syndrome as both a neurotic disorder (code F48.8) and a culture-specific disorder (Annexe 2) caused by &quot;undue concern about the debilitating effects of the passage of semen&quot;<br /><br />It is very common in Nepali culture as well. Most of them come with the complaints of &quot;drops&quot; and become extremely anxious about it and see it as loss of &quot;male power&quot;. It is often related with obsessive ruminations and somatoform symptoms. Others see it as a distinct clinical entity which is less culture-bound than these critics assert, and describe it as one form of a syndrome of &quot;semen-loss anxiety&quot; which also occurs in other Eastern cultures as jiryan and shen-k&#039;uei, as well as in Western cultures.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hehe.

I sincerely hope no one gets the idea that sex addiction is any better than chronic masturbation, because it isn&#039;t. I know personally about that during my days of being addicted to internet/FWB hookups.&nbsp; Fortunately those days are in the past, and I believe that a moderate amount of activity is good, to keep the pump primed and the wheels greased. Less is definitely more though.&nbsp; Ron Jeremy once said, that if you really want to have good sex(like in porn), you should hold out for a few days, then have sex a day or two before, but not more than once.&nbsp; That is good advice, coming from someone who knows! ;p&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ok I have to ask something.<br /><br />Since I saw this thread I have been thinking a lot. Cut the porn and maybe cut masturbation.<br /><br />The first was easy, but I find hard to stop the second. I don&#039;t know if I am an addict. I am used to do it before and after sleeping. Never more than 2. I tried to fully stop but the last 3 days I find it impossible. <br /><br />At least I stopped using porn and that&#039;s a good sign. What do you say?<br />Is there any addiction in my situation? I find it normal to do it 1 or 2 times per day...<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Adamiz

That&#039;s all. It&#039;s impossible to &quot;break&quot; your dopaminergic system with that, unless you are addicted&nbsp; masturbation and do it every hour or so. So stopping masturbation will not have a long-term effect on your energy/confidence/alertness/being better at everything.<br /><br />Telling yourself that &quot;if I do x (e.g. praying at the moon god at 9pm every day), then I will have more energy, confidence, alertness and will be better at everything&quot; can have a huge effect however, if you believe in it. See the links on self-hypnosis and autosuggestion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />20 mins? woah there mate, got a citation? effects on androgen, dopamine, estrogen and opiod receptors last up to 2 weeks according to actual studies. you can find the links on yourbrainonporn.com. studies on rats show dopamine receptors take the full 2 to get back up<br /><br />all you&#039;ve said so far is &quot;its placebo and im gonna make up evidence&quot;<br />check out http://www.socioaffectiveneuroscipsychol.net/index.php/snp/article/view/20767/29179 - the problem with fapping isnt necessarily fapping anyway but porn. but quirks of fapping (lower prolactin release fe) make it worse<br /><br />i wont argue this thread anymore, its pointless. try it you aint got shit to lose but a month of fapping.. if thats such a big deal then you probably have a problem anyway!
