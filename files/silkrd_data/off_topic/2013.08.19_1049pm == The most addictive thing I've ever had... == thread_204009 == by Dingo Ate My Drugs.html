				... Is Sugar.<br /><br />So I&#039;m trying to eat healthier. I am not unhealthy, but I could eat better. So I have started eating less processed food. In particular sweet foods.<br />And I really think that processed sugar is more addictive than cocaine (in a way). The urge to eat something like a chocolate biscuit is pretty high. <br /><br />The thought won&#039;t go away. At least with cocaine, I only think about it whilst high on it, or shortly afterwards. Not 4 days...<br />Anybody else find the same thing?

				I agree. When I was trying to build muscle, I had to go on a low (compared to what most people in the US eat) sugar diet,<br />because high insulin levels don&#039;t coexist well with human growth hormone from my understanding.<br />It drove me insane, made me crave things that I usually never eat like big disgusting bacon and grease burgers from <br />big fast food chains, and other random shit. I think everyone would shit their pants simultaneously if sugar somehow disappeared from the face of the earth

				sugar is creeper, i am not a big candy fan, but every once in a while i get craving so strong i have to get one of those cups with random sour candy, or sour patch kids, and i want them all in my mouth at the same time. in the end i feel like an asshole<br />and fast food is the devil. it&#039;s so easy and fast. takes minimum effort. a phone call or a few clicks away and it&#039;s at your door. eating healthy is some real shit yo.

Processes foods aren&#039;t very healthy, but it is the norm now to eat mostly processed food.<br />When you go to the supermarket and read the labels on anything, there is a long list of chemicals that ave been added to sweeten / preserve / colour it.<br /><br />I really do think that processed sugar is highly addictive though.<br />You don&#039;t get cravings for fruit like you do for things that contain processed sugar. Natural sugar is sweet, but isn&#039;t as satisfying.

I&#039;m fine without sugar often, but after a while I just get a ridiculous urge to eat something sweet, made from processes sugar.<br />I&#039;m not a big fan of fast food, but I definitely see the potential for it to be a problem. It&#039;s so easy and full of crap. Perhaps watching people I know get themselves into a very obese state by constantly eating fast food has put me off it. I know some people who eat fast food for every meal. They never buy groceries. They just go for a drive when they are hungry and buy burger &amp; chips or an ice-cream. 4 - 7 times per day for 10+ years. Fucking disgusting if you ask me. I don&#039;t know how people can live like that. And here they are telling me I am unhealthy because I use drugs&nbsp; ::)

				Coka Cola.<br />From the age of maybe 15 on starting with 8 or so. 2-3L every day. About a month ago i quit! Only water now, made me realize that i really was addicted to fucking coka cola, as stupid as that may sound.<br /><br />Tobacco is similar addictive to me, i don&#039;t have any problems with cannabis, alcohol or mdma. I can smoke huge amouts over weeks if wanted and then just quit 120%&gt;0% OKNP ;D<br />Since i have done mdma i don&#039;t do alcohol anymore, also i don&#039;t do mdma anymore, but the mdma really showed me that i would rather do mdma again then doing alcohol ever again even tho&#039; it&#039;s perfectly legal to do so in this country that i&#039;m living in called [GER].
