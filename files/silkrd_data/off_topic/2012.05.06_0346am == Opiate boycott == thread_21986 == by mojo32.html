				Seriously why has this not happened. We have vendors like Vicodin charging almost $2 a mg for a fucking percocet and almost $1.50 a mg for hydrocodone I mean seriously WTF. Ive been here almost a year now and am an opiate lover myself and I have only made one opiate purchase and it was with thedman62 for a morphine 30 which I believe was fairly priced. We have vendors on here like him and theOCguy with very reasonable prices on good products and for some reason they are near the bottom of the bestselling list while people like vicodin are at the top. And its your faults, the buyers not the sellers because if people didnt buy their products they would either stop selling or lower their prices. I&#039;ve been suporting my opiate habit IRL because its much easier and cheaper and doesnt support this bullshit borderline scam going on in the opiate section. We the buyers can change this and all it takes it a little will power and its not to hard just don&#039;t buy from vendors with these skyhigh prices and they will go away or bring the price lower. I mean on the street hydrocodone10&#039;s go from $1-5 so there is no excuse for them being listed at $13. Come on opiate lovers unite and don&#039;t give in. Theres my late night rant.

				mojo32,<br />a lot of what you say is true. your IRL prices for hydrocodone 10mg are identical to mine. <br />I had a good purchase with thedman62 as well -- his morphine is reasonably price. <br /><br />I think a lot of the reason you see vicodin at the top is because he&#039;s a good seller who is consistent. <br />A ton of people who come here, come because either A.) They don&#039;t have a local connect and/or B.) They&#039;re too sketched out by their local connect<br /><br />On one hand I agree with you.. I would be purchasing a hell of a lot more opiates if the prices were reasonable. But on the other hand you are paying for a service. The shop has to go out of the way to procure the product (risk #1), transport the product (risk #2), and then ship the product (risk #3, with the hidden risk #4 of it not showing up and having to deal with THAT process of dealing with buy-scammers).<br /><br />Sometimes I think it comes down to simple supply and demand... and then I think about how incredibly fucking interesting the fluctuation of prices in goods on this site are.

				I agree man, the prices are complete shit. My latest purchase was 5 40&#039;s for $125 which I felt was very fair. They were from Netherlands though, which sucks with customs, but it did arrive. I don&#039;t get why so many people use Vicodin who overcharges SOO much. I make sure to check nearly every listing before making a purchase to make sure I&#039;m getting the best deal.

				I can understand why they are charging as much as they do. There is supply and risks, and so naturally they will charge as much as they can get. As TSR grows, we can hope that an increase in supply will cause prices to fall, but at the same time, more buyers may keep the price high. It is a capitalists conundrum, truly.

				I agree and wish some of these vendors would charge less for their opiates. IMO the whole &quot;Im risking my freedom, so STFU and pay out the ass&quot; just doesnt hold any validity to me. The fact is, vendors sell drugs to make a profit, and some of them are just straight up greedy and want to rape their customers for as much $$$$ as possible.<br /><br />Not to mention that regardless what these vendors charge, whether its a hundred a pill or a dollar a pill, the risk is still exactly the same. <br /><br />IRL where im at, its a buck a mg for oxys. My buddy who sells em pays........ahhh its sad.... NOTHING! for his fucking script of pure oxy 10mg! Lmao. Thats how fucked up some of these greedy dealers are. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				These threads have popped up ever since I was a lurker here on SR 8 months ago. An opiate boycott is a silly idea. All that implies is that you feel your opinions and actions should be forced upon others who aren&#039;t already completely in agreement. Obviously the prices which exist in just about every niche throughout Silk Road are prices which someone would be willing to pay due to an expected return of higher value than that which they would sacrifice. Also, nobody bought a seller account to price items at a level that nobody would agree to. It is quite possible that certain sellers use the prices you perceive as high to be able to provide every customer with what they desire in a timely matter. If prices were cut in half right now, it is obvious that many sellers would not be able to meet the demand. Basically I just want you to acknowledge that the ability to access certain drugs on here as well as receiving the premium of anonymous delivery is not otherwise available to some others ever even if it is for you. Additionally, prices that are actually too high will naturally equate to no money for vendors which will drive prices to their demanded range. Silk Road is seriously a global market, one which we can not assume to yield the same results as your local market.

				Ok tell you what... YOU go out to a doctor complaining of symptoms, then convince the health care provider to even write you a prescription for them. You will find that is the single most difficult aspect of sourcing opiates. Doctors are scared to death of the DEA/DOJ scrutiny and audits. Then IF you get the prescription, you have further scrutiny by the pharmacists because of DEA/DOJ scrutiny and audits. Then if all that goes well, time comes for payment. If you are uninsured you have very high doctors visit costs and very high pharmacy costs for the opiate medicine. Even if you are insured you still have costs for the doctors visit and for the medicine, plus what you pay in insurance premiums. Obamacare fucked me real good ... all my costs increased by over 127% across the board.<br /><br />Dont like it?<br /><br />Buy elsewhere.

				That disability shit is getting harder to get. It&#039;s not at all as easy as bullshittin a doctor anymore, and where one may &quot;win&quot; disability, the drugs are drying up fast. I have worked all my life and made pretty decent money, always paid my fucking FICA and whatnot. Now I&#039;m 100% disabled and can&#039;t get disability because I have a felony warrant. The charge is absolute bullshit, if I went to court with an attorney it wouldn&#039;t even make it to trial, which I would insist upon. But I&#039;m fucked up for real. I have had doctors who were anti-narcotic as a mutherfucker, it was against everything they stood for, give me 300 vicodin a month. I can get any pain medication I want, all I have to do is ask (when I have a doctor). But it&#039;s still getting harder because of people getting them that don&#039;t need them or reselling them, in addition to our government&#039;s preexisting bent towards prohibiting chemicals that have any pleasurable side effects. I am thankful that some people resell them, because times like now when I have no doctor, I can still have pain medication. I would never sell a single fucking pill because they have such a huge impact on the quality of my life, but that doesn&#039;t matter. If things continue the way they are going, narcotic painkillers will only be prescribed to congressman and other esteemed and valued members of society. <br /><br />I hate to hear about people like your friend who get all this shit and don&#039;t need it, while I can&#039;t get any help because of a bogus charge. And no, I&#039;m not willing to go clear it up. They just wanna drain me of as much money as possible and since I don&#039;t have much for them to drain they&#039;ll take it out in inconvenience and probably lock me up for as long as they can while court dates come around etc.&nbsp; It bothers me so much to think of what has become of this country and how indifferent our government is to people&#039;s suffering. While people like your buddy seem to be the cause of it, they are not, they accelerate the process, but not cause it. It is just how the US government does things. Prohibition is the number one agenda for them. They do not care anything about the citizens anymore and if you don&#039;t believe that, you are willfully ignorant. This need I have for pain medication that I cannot legally satisfy is the only reason I still buy heroin. I&#039;ve been a hardcore junkie and I kicked before. I hate tempting fate by doing heroin again, but the government leaves me little choice, and soon, heroin will be the only pain medication available to the average citizen.<br /><br />Hopefully I will have a doctor again soon and can stop paying twenty some dollars for 60mg morphine, even though that&#039;s cheap for street prices. I have no idea what in the fuck we are gonna do. People are all just self absorbed, greedy, completely void of empathy or concern for their fellow citizen. The government is outta fucking control and nullifying the constitution at a ridiculously fast rate. Their policies are more and more anti-human every week, which just makes the citizens even more about self preservation and willing to sacrificing their neighbor for their own comfort. These people around here that suggest turning other members over to LE are a fucking sickening reminder that for the most part, people are shit. And if you&#039;re a LEO reading this, I have no idea how you sleep at night. You are a cancer and you bring nothing positive at all in to the world. You may lock me up and beat me like you have in times past, but when I die, I&#039;ll do so with a clear conscious. Quit that repulsive, immoral job and be clean so that when you draw that last breath you will at least know that you weren&#039;t the arms and hands of of the most anti-human and cruel force on earth, the US government.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry for the rant, but it happens from time to time.<br /><br />tl;dr nothing, bummer about your fat lazy friend

				Btw, I should add one thing to my off topic (kinda) raving rambling post. I really enjoy heroin. I think it&#039;s a wonderful chemical if you treat it with respect and healthy fear. I am happy to have a reason to do dope, honestly. But, I would not do it if had the pills I needed.

And there is use complaining about it, thats how you spread awareness and try to start a movement. If buyers just started buying off vendors with cheaper opiates then more than likely people like vicodin would have to lower his prices or get out.&nbsp; And I haven&#039;t bought any because I actually am not going to support that bullshit. Atleast im trying to do something about these prices, it may not work to well but its a step in the right direction.

People with more money than you would buy them all as soon as the listings went up.<br /><br />So you cant afford to buy enough pills on SR to get you fucked up all day everyday, but you can afford to buy some for when you really want them.

I did not start this thread for opinions on what you think of opiates. And when I smoke weed I get greatly enhanced pain and my heart races so thats a no-no for me and I do meditate and it helps me to not take as much opiates as I usually would. Like really your post was pointless, add something to the thread or don&#039;t post at all. Please and thank you.

				Its true that its easier to &quot;police&quot; legitimate health care providers and pharmacists. They are so god damned scared of going to prison that many are simply refusing to prescribe narcotics altogether.<br /><br />You now have uneducated bureaucrats and insurance companies determining treatment, not doctors. The doctors have lists of treatment they are &quot;allowed&quot; to use, and must try some first even if they dont feel its best for the patients needs.<br /><br />I expect prices to skyrocket even more so get your opiates while you can.

And yes they would sell out alot faster but if they could also put in order a minimum purchase type deal. Also im sure the vendor would like getting his money back as quick as possible and then he could re stock and re-list his products faster. It could make a race type game for us opiate lovers which would be exciting lol.<br />

				There are also a lot of other &quot;hidden&quot; costs associated with vending.<br /><br />Packaging material, and postage. <br /><br />Not to mention, I would be damned if I did it on a computer I kept at my house. I would buy a lap top, and keep it stashed at a friends place and go over there to check it every few days.
