				I realize there is a Festival topic stickied but I didn&#039;t feel as if that was relevant to my question.<br /><br />In the far but foreseeable future there are certain festivals I plan on capitalize by bringing a good sum of dutch MDMA pills in each day and selling them.<br />What are some good tactics for bringing them in and also marketing without being sketchy?

				Depends what country your in I suppose. In Aus we have multitudes of police armed with canine&#039;s so no matter where you try to conceal the package it is much much more risky. The best is when its a 30 degree day and the dogs are dieing of dehydration and cannot be fucked moving&nbsp; :P They even do strip searches and the &#039;bend over and cough&#039; if they believe you have contraband hidden in your arse hole which is pretty fucked up. I guess triple vac sealing the product an hour before the event and then rubbing down with alcohol could be an option, but even then the risk isn&#039;t worth the reward. I think you&#039;ll find with dutch beans you won&#039;t need to go to a festival to push volume, that will come regardless. In terms of marketing, I think anyone who gives off any vibe whatsoever associated with pushing drugs is sketchy, that is simply out of the question (for me anyway). Certain people are known to hang red&nbsp; pirate flags on their tent at a few festivals in Aus to let people know they have stock, I wouldn&#039;t be caught dead doing that, but each to their own&nbsp; ;) I tend to agree with Aurelius, good product will push itself.
