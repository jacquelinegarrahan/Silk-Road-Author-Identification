				Hi peeps,<br /><br />Would any of you wonderful people (it helps to visualize me stroking your shoes here, for the sympathy factor of course) be kind enough to gift me 0.3 BTC in order to complete a purchase?&nbsp; I would be most&nbsp; grateful indeed.<br /><br />If anybody does decide to feel charitable then please post here to prevent multiple acts of kindness taking place.<br /><br />I would suggest using the&nbsp; &quot;Send bitcoins to another Silk Road member:&quot; feature so I can see from whom it was sent (presumably) in case I have to return duplicated acts of generosity.<br /><br />My SR username is FatFreddy.&nbsp; Alternatively you could use 16dFoSDP2ivdKiivsbQgtdULJaYqF86Ba1 but I would not know how to return txs that were not need.&nbsp; If a sender address was included then I could but I don&#039;t see how this is possible.<br /><br />Many thanks and a happy new year to all you [mostly] lovely people.<br /><br />FatFredddy a.k.a. Mr Shiva<br /><br />

				Why don&#039;t you just pm the seller and make a custom listing for 0.3 BTC less of what you were ordering. I&#039;m sure most will understand.

				I did ask for a custom order but they apologized and said no.<br /><br />Clearly they have a reason and who am I to argue otherwise?&nbsp; I know nothing of what goes on at there end so for I all know they may have a very valid reason.&nbsp; One reason I could think of is all the extra work it work take them if everybody then started requesting custom orders so I could sympathize with this.<br /><br />In any case, thanks muchly Novocaine.&nbsp; With your help the deal has been finalized and the universe is once again in perfect balance.
