				So, recently there was another shooting in the news (here in America). I realized that I really have no idea what to think about the right to bear arms. Thoughts? Do control laws reduce overall violence or does it just keep legitimate people from getting them? I feel like limiting access will stop the random public shootings done by lunatics but it wouldn&#039;t stop organized crime/other criminals. <br />Any ideas?

				My state is one of several &quot;Constitutional Carry&quot; states, meaning you don&#039;t need a concealed weapons permit to carry a concealed firearm, based on your second amendment rights. I&#039;m in favor of even less gun control. It&#039;s idiotic to think politicians are going to actually try and put everybody&#039;s firearm on a list or that the UN is going to be able to go door to door to round up everybody&#039;s guns. The only way to go about that would be an Executive Order from Obama to the military, and as soon as he issued something like that, the military would turn on him in a second. It&#039;s a lot easier to go to capture and purge the Whitehouse than it is to try fighting a war against millions of pissed of gun owners. Criminals don&#039;t give a fuck about guns laws, so stricter gun control only leads to more innocent people not being able to defend themselves. The way to reduce gun violence is to have more private law abiding citizens packing heat, plain and simple.

				My thoughts are you should be able to conceal a firearm without a permit because the Constitution does grant us that right. It&#039;s too bad that so many fuck ups had to fuck that up and continue to fuck it up so gun control laws keep getting stricter as time goes on.<br /><br />Secretive

				Homicide rates rose 300% in Victoria 1 year after guns were banned in Australia by duress from federal government (federal government was not legally able to rule on gun control as this was reserved to state legislation, the answer was to threaten every state with funding prohibitions (not cuts) until they had complied). Between 2004 -2009, the number of reported firearms stolen in Australia increased by 6% every year. In 2008-2009, 1,570 guns were reported stolen across the country. <br /><br />The stats show a fairly clear trend so hopefully I don’t need to spell this out for anybody. <br /><br />I watched the highly sensationalised coverage on various networks until I grew bored and switched stations. It was dramatized, one-sided and predictable so I didn’t even bother considering their particular viewpoints on the matter. Last time I checked the object of journalism was to broadcast without putting their own personal little musings on the matter. <br /><br />One thing struck me odd. Network 10 (not to mention a British broadcasting agency) ran a segment three weeks prior on the need for tighter gun control, and one of the newsreaders commented that the only thing that would push the message through would be if someone shot a bunch of kids. <br /><br />The same circumstances happened in Australia in 1996. The media started running features on tighter gun control, and was proceeded by a fairly capable person taking out civilians in Port Arthur. Both shooters attempted to maximise casualties. Martin Bryant was observed taking aim of victims and bagging running headshots, impossible without a high level of clear headedness and prior training, or at least practice. Incidentally, 9 years before Port Arthur the NSW premier said there would be no effective gun control in Australia until there was a massacre in Tasmania. <br /><br />This isn’t the part where I state my stance on gun control, assuming I have one. I merely wanted to point out that the Australian media handled it pretty badly in the “fair and impartial reporting” department, and that I know sh*t when I see it. I’m not giving rise to debate of any “cover-ups” or the big bad boogyman or whatever it is that people rant on about whenever someone says something they can’t intelligently explain. But most of us went to school, right? (Is anyone here still in nappies/diapers?) Some of us went to uni too? Didn’t you attend one of those classes where they showed us how to intelligently weigh up elements and arguments before blurting out our opinions like high school drop-outs (no offense if you didn’t finish school)? I guess that was my point. Before anyone reading this rants on in an angry, confused reply post with one or two lines of 3 year old logic interspersed with explicit language and fragmented shards of sub-rate English that, even when translated, means absolutely nothing, perhaps the smart thing to do would be admit that there are some similarities between Port Arthur and Sandy Hook Elementary School, both of them tragic and so absolutely needless. <br /><br />(btw, I didn’t say anything bad or even lean one way or the other so if I see someone give me bad Karma I’ll know they can’t hack a debate, lol. If you disagree with me just phucing say so.)<br /><br />Piece out, drive safely. :)

				^^^ Telling it like it is(was).<br /><br />Very true, disheartening words Razorspyne, i lost guns in 1996, guns that were family heirlooms, irreplaceable. All because the Aussie Media flat out TOLD the public that it was Bryant, WEEKS before there was a farce of a court hearing.<br /><br />The Tasmania Police FUCKING PIGS held a mentally handicapped man with an IQ of 66 (the mind of a ten year old boy) in solitary confinement for 3 months until he confessed to the killing spree (Think - interrogation of a intellectually handicapped man by highly trained detectives (one named Det. PAYNE) and there was no lawyer present at any time)<br /><br />There is a record of what happened in that time while they were interrogating Bryant, evidence was entered in a Tasmania court by Damian Bugg QC, a police interview transcript. This transcript is over 300 pages long, HALF OF IT WAS MISSING OR DELETED. The judge in court had no problem with this(!?). There was no video evidence of this interrogation due to &quot;Technical Malfunction of video equipment on the day&quot; according to police prosecutors.<br /><br />The Aussie populace ate it up like dumb-arse little worker bees. They lapped up the illegal actions of a local newspaper, who illegally printed Martin Bryants face on the front page of their paper, BEFORE any of the witnesses were questioned, thus &#039;spoiling&#039; their accounts.<br /><br />This was shortly AFTER Kerry Packer took over the news. Coincidence? No.<br /><br />Also, John Howard denied a Coronial Enquiry into this matter (which is highly illegal), Australias BIGGEST mass shooting EVER, and there was no coronial enquiry?! WTF?!?<br /><br />To the people interested not only in what the media tell them - the internet has a wealth of information and misinformation, especially on Port Arthur Massacre, but make up your own mind with the available facts.

				A handgun or shotgun to protect yourself, alright there could be some use to that. And since it&#039;s in the constitution you should be able to defend yourself this is reasonable, right? <br />But who the fuck needs a (semi)automatic weapon or rocket launcher (are they legal in the US? I won&#039;t be surprised.. ::) ) <br /><br />I say, make those weapons available to the Army only. No citizen should have this stuff in his home, including veterans. Once they retire they&#039;ll become citizens again so normal law applies. <br />People will be given 5 years to return those weapons to the government and trade them for a standard issue handgun or shotgun. <br />After 5 years those weapons will be government property so having them lay around would be theft of government property.

				Once again someone&#039;s beaten me to post, so once again I come off unoriginal. Non semi is single cock, semi is one cock for clip, full auto is uninterrupted spray without need for individual clicks of the trigger (hold down). Hope that made sense. I don&#039;t even know if they make non semi-automatics anymore. They&#039;re horribly outdated. I&#039;m pretty sure a rocket launcher is not available to general public Knomo! Lol. Are you thinking of FULLY automatic weapons? Assault rifles with customised open-end bullpup configurations? Your average gun nut probably would be restricted in that regard, usually army and spec forces carry that sh*t around, but consult your local NRA for more information. (Normal rifles can be purchases easily enough though.)<br /><br />Didn&#039;t know of all that info on Martin Bryant. Knowing the sort of scum LE are, I don&#039;t need to be drawn a picture of why half the police interview transcript was missing and why they switched off the cameras for the interview. By rights this was a mistrial, as corrupted evidence by default results in the accused being released with no further charges pending (as in OJ Simpson). Didn&#039;t he have access to a lawyer? By law one must be provided. And if he was mentally disabled, then an interpreter aide needs to be there in addition to the barrister. Sounds like you know more law than I do, but I know THAT much at least.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Don&#039;t forget to eat (yeah you always do when you&#039;re typing. Besides, heart rate almost doubles, get hungry quicker, get thinner quicker.) Anyway I&#039;m going I&#039;m going lol. Piece out.<br /><br />(pmsl Red Rama.... it&#039;s spray and pray, not pray and spray lol. You spray, and pray some of it hits your target.(Not pissing, I mean gunburst))<br /><br /><br /><br />Sheeeeeeesh....... While I was writing this two more posts came through. Clarification from Knomo re: auto vs. semi-auto. Re: Okamiyasha, if you can use a gun in a situation like you described to save a life, it makes you wonder why police &quot;have to&quot; empty a whole clip into someone&#039;s heart from point blank range. btw, taser guns were brought into Australia to replace, not accompany, their preexisting guns as too many innocent civilians were needlessly shot dead by police in that particular year. For some reason they forgot to take their revolvers (in Australia they have revolvers not Glocks) off them when they were given tasers. <br /><br />It&#039;s an unarguable fact that there are some great cops, totally dedicated to upholding the law, ready to risk their lives and morally unquestionable. Sadly, it&#039;s also an unarguable fact that these same great cops have been deceased for many years. (Not sure if that came out right ;) )

Pistols, especially larger calibers, are very difficult to master effectively. Just like those professional stunt-drivers you see on TV! Many years of practice they have stunting, mmm.<br /><br />ALL firearms have a some form of physically activated safety feature to help minimise misfires. Kinda like a seat-belt in a vehicle, it enhances safety, but accidents and deaths still occur.<br /><br />There are MANY, MANY more deaths involving vehicles, than there are firearms. One may think that if the Governments of the world are actually worried about saving lives, they&#039;d ban all vehicles? They would never do this, the world would fall apart.

				The fact that some of you resort to name calling really speaks volumes on how well you can argue your position.<br /><br />Although I agree with the pro-gun advocates that the state should not have a monopoly on the tools of violence, your guns won&#039;t do shit against the government if they are backed by the military. It&#039;s no contest.You can&#039;t hold up in your shack if it&#039;s a smouldering crater. Even the police would outgun just about every American. They are trained and have better equipment in large numbers, they will roll you. It would be a horrible shitty bloody war and I hope to never have to see it, but whoever controls the military and the police runs shit. <br /><br />And that&#039;s because we are all paying for it with our taxes. The weapon companies that make all these guns get most of their coin from you already when you pay the tax man. Which is funny, because if your taxes went to important shit like helping out mentally ill children or educating instead of indoctrinating we would probably have fewer sick kids get desperate and lose it.

Though I have to disagree on the military/police part. Any extreme measure Obama took would be far more likely to turn the military against him. No army wants to go through the trouble of trying to go door to door trying to round up everyone&#039;s guns. It&#039;s a logistical nightmare the U.S. army wouldn&#039;t want any part of. Even with the police backing them up it&#039;s still a losing effort on their part. You also have to remember that there are more military bases worldwide than there are on U.S. soil. Not to mention if we defeated the greatest military force in the world once, we could certainly do it again. The majority of massacres in this country are carried out by people who bought the firearms legally. What annoys me the most is the same politicians going up on the podium saying we need stricter gun laws are the same assholes a year ago that were arming the Mexican Cartels.

				It seems almost everyone &quot;knows&quot; America has a problem with guns. Each mass shooting in America is followed by a wave of commentary insisting that America&#039;s &quot;gun culture&quot; is a problem that Australia has done well to avoid. John Howard&#039;s 1996 gun laws are offered up as proof of our wisdom, and Howard himself describes them as one of his proudest achievements.<br /><br />Underlying all this is the belief that the availability of guns results in more crime, therefore removing guns from private hands makes the community safer. America&#039;s problem, it is said, is simply too many guns.<br /><br />The problem with that is it is totally false. Australia has never shown any inclination to emulate America with respect to gun ownership. Howard&#039;s gun laws achieved nothing in terms of public safety. Neither strict gun laws nor the level of gun ownership bear any relationship to crime, in Australia or elsewhere. And America&#039;s problem with guns, to the extent that it is a problem, is its policy of leaving the vulnerable undefended.<br /><br />The massacre at Sandy Hook in the US in which 20 children and seven adults were murdered occurred in a Gun Free Zone. Guns are banned from all schools in Connecticut, as well as most other states.<br /><br />There was nobody in the school with any practical means of countering the demented gunman who committed that atrocity. The little children and their teachers were utterly defenceless.<br /><br />The two people murdered a couple of days earlier in the shopping centre in Oregon were also in a Gun Free Zone. In fact all the mass murders in the last 20 years in America, including Columbine and Virginia Tech, have occurred in Gun Free Zones.<br /><br />One measure of insanity is to repeat the same failure time after time hoping that the next time the failure will turn out to be a success. Gun Free Zones are a lethal insanity. What this latest tragedy ought to prompt is a rising chorus of Americans demanding the elimination of what are effectively Criminal Safe Zones. What it is prompting instead is a crescendo of demands for greater gun control.<br /><br />Yet gun control laws have never had any impact on crime rates anywhere in the world.<br /><br />Malaysia has one of the strictest gun control laws in the world including the death penalty for illegal possession of a firearm. That has not stopped criminals from obtaining or using firearms in crime, or of engaging in shoot-outs with police.<br /><br />Britain banned pistols in 1997 following the Dunblane tragedy. In the following two years the use of pistols in crime rose by 40 percent. In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The chances of being mugged in London are six times greater than in New York.<br /><br />In 1974 in Jamaica, legislation was introduced banning the private ownership of firearms and ammunition. The Prime Minister Michael Manley told the country, &quot;There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.&quot; The sentence for almost any firearms crime was life imprisonment. There was no bail for those charged.<br /><br />The murder rate in 1973 was 11 per 100,000. It soon rose to 30 and peaked at 40 per 100,000 in 1980. In May 2007 the World Bank issued a report saying, &quot;Murder rates in the Caribbean (it was referring to Jamaica) – at 30 per 100,000 population annually – are higher than for any other region of the world and assault rates, at least based on assaults reported to police, are also significantly above the world average.&quot;<br /><br />The Republic of Ireland banned virtually all firearms in 1973, requiring their surrender within just three days, based on concerns about the IRA. The following year the number of murders doubled and stayed at that level for the next 20 years. Other violent crimes increased as well.<br /><br />In October 2003 the US Centre for Disease Control released a major study on gun control laws in the US in which it reviewed 51 published studies on eight different types of gun laws dating back to the 1970s. It covered firearms bans, ammunition bans, waiting periods, background checks, gun registration, gun owner licensing, right to carry laws, child access-prevention laws, &quot;zero tolerance&quot; of weapons in schools and various combinations of laws.<br /><br />The main outcome was the finding of &quot;insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness&quot; of those laws on violent crimes, suicides and accidental injuries. This despite the huge data set.<br /><br />Since 1999 there have been almost a dozen academic studies of the impact of the Howard gun laws. All used Australian Bureau of Statistics cause of death figures. Probably the most authoritative was a paper by two female researchers, Baker and McPhedran. Peer reviewed and published in a credible journal, it showed no effect of the gun laws.<br /><br />Based on the paper, the head of the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, Dr Don Weatherburn, said:<br /><br />&quot;I too strongly supported the introduction of tougher gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre.<br /><br />&quot;The fact is, however, that the introduction of those laws did not result in any acceleration of the downward trend in gun homicide. They may have reduced the risk of mass shootings but we cannot be sure because no one has done the rigorous statistical work required to verify this possibility.<br /><br />&quot;It is always unpleasant to acknowledge facts that are inconsistent with your own point of view. But I thought that was what distinguished science from popular prejudice.&quot;<br /><br />A 2008 publication (Lee and Suardi) was probably the most statistically exhaustive. It applied a battery of statistical tests to homicide and suicide data for the entire period 1915 to 2004, looking for a break point in the long term trend that could be attributed to the new laws. What they concluded was: &quot;... there is little evidence to suggest that [the National Firearms Agreement] had any significant effects on firearm homicides and suicides. In addition, there also does not appear to be any substitution effects – that reduced access to firearms may have led those bent on committing homicide or suicide to use alternative methods.&quot;<br /><br />Some have pointed to more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings as evidence of the impact. But mass shootings are rare and also did not occur in the 1950s, 60s and 70s despite easy firearm availability and minimal licensing.<br /><br />On the other hand, mass murders have continued since the Howard gun laws. Examples include the Childers backpacker hostel fire and the nursing home fire at Quakers Hill. Furthermore, Australia&#039;s second worst mass murder, after Port Arthur, was a deliberately lit fire at the Whisky a Go Go disco in Brisbane in 1973.<br /><br />It is also false to assume that strict gun laws have prevented massacres elsewhere. Despite tight regulation of firearms in Germany, in Berlin in 1999 a teenager went on a rampage killing 15 people before taking his own life. In 2002 in Erfurt a 19 year-old former student shot 16 people before killing himself.<br /><br />The assumption that guns are freely available throughout America is equally false. Gun laws vary enormously within the country, from virtual prohibition to virtual laissez faire. There are also federal laws that severely restrict ownership of certain firearms.<br /><br />Never acknowledged by those who endorse gun control is the fact that the states and cities with the strictest gun laws are those with the highest violent crime rates. Chief among these are Washington and Chicago.<br /><br />Washington DC has one of the worst murder rates in the country. But the murder rate was declining up to 1976 when a blanket ban on handguns and ready to use long arms was introduced. Between 1976 and 1991 the murder rate rose 200% while the overall US rate rose only 9%.<br /><br />The State of New Hampshire, on the other hand, is one of 41 with a permit system for concealed carry of pistols for self-defence. Its Bill of Rights says, &quot;All persons have the right to keep and bear arms in defences of themselves, their families, their property and the state&quot;.<br /><br />New Hampshire has some of the lowest crime rates in the US and is nationally regarded as one of the safest places in which to live.<br /><br />Since the early 1990s gun laws have been considerably relaxed in the US, particularly regarding self-defence, yet there has been no resulting increase in crime. The US national murder rate in 1991 was 9.8 per 100,000 but fell to 5.6 in 2006 and has continued to fall since.<br /><br />The main change has been a big increase in states that allow concealed carry. Over five million Americans have concealed carry permits, just over two percent of the adult population.<br /><br />In the states in which permits are issued, multiple victim public killings of the kind seen at Sandy Hook and Port Arthur have declined substantially. On hundreds of occasions, rarely mentioned in the media, armed citizens have either prevented massacres or reduced their impact by shooting back. Indeed, the only significant massacres in those states have occurred where guns were not permitted, such as schools and shopping malls.<br /><br />Israel has had similar success in stopping mass public shootings. When it was realised that the police and military simply couldn&#039;t be there to protect people all the time when terrorists attack, a change of policy led to Israelis encouraged to carry concealed handguns. Since then terrorist gun attacks have been rare.<br /><br />Today about 15 percent of Jewish adults in Israel have permits to carry concealed handguns. Thus in large public gatherings many citizens – unknown beforehand to the terrorists – are able to shoot back at them. During waves of terror attacks, Israel&#039;s national police chief will call on concealed handgun permit holders to make sure they carry firearms at all times.<br /><br />The assumption that stricter gun laws can prevent the misuse of guns is just as misguided as the notion that strict drug laws prevent the misuse of drugs. Prohibition merely sends the business underground and increases the profits available to criminals. It cannot make something disappear.<br /><br />If America had not declared its schools to be Gun Free Zones, one of the school&#039;s teachers at Sandy Hook may have been legally carrying a gun and thus able to save many lives.<br /><br />This tragedy should be a wakeup call to those who want to prevent them from occurring again. Arming the good guys is how you prevent the bad guys from causing harm.

Each mass shooting in America is followed by a wave of commentary insisting that America&#039;s &quot;gun culture&quot; is a problem that Australia has done well to avoid. John Howard&#039;s 1996 gun laws are offered up as proof of our wisdom, and Howard himself describes them as one of his proudest achievements.<br /><br />Underlying all this is the belief that the availability of guns results in more crime, therefore removing guns from private hands makes the community safer. America&#039;s problem, it is said, is simply too many guns.<br /><br />The problem with that is it is totally false. Australia has never shown any inclination to emulate America with respect to gun ownership. Howard&#039;s gun laws achieved nothing in terms of public safety. Neither strict gun laws nor the level of gun ownership bear any relationship to crime, in Australia or elsewhere. And America&#039;s problem with guns, to the extent that it is a problem, is its policy of leaving the vulnerable undefended.<br /><br />The massacre at Sandy Hook in the US in which 20 children and seven adults were murdered occurred in a Gun Free Zone. Guns are banned from all schools in Connecticut, as well as most other states.<br /><br />There was nobody in the school with any practical means of countering the demented gunman who committed that atrocity. The little children and their teachers were utterly defenceless.<br /><br />The two people murdered a couple of days earlier in the shopping centre in Oregon were also in a Gun Free Zone. In fact all the mass murders in the last 20 years in America, including Columbine and Virginia Tech, have occurred in Gun Free Zones.<br /><br />One measure of insanity is to repeat the same failure time after time hoping that the next time the failure will turn out to be a success. Gun Free Zones are a lethal insanity. What this latest tragedy ought to prompt is a rising chorus of Americans demanding the elimination of what are effectively Criminal Safe Zones. What it is prompting instead is a crescendo of demands for greater gun control.<br /><br />Yet gun control laws have never had any impact on crime rates anywhere in the world.<br /><br />Malaysia has one of the strictest gun control laws in the world including the death penalty for illegal possession of a firearm. That has not stopped criminals from obtaining or using firearms in crime, or of engaging in shoot-outs with police.<br /><br />Britain banned pistols in 1997 following the Dunblane tragedy. In the following two years the use of pistols in crime rose by 40 percent. In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The chances of being mugged in London are six times greater than in New York.<br /><br />In 1974 in Jamaica, legislation was introduced banning the private ownership of firearms and ammunition. The Prime Minister Michael Manley told the country, &quot;There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.&quot; The sentence for almost any firearms crime was life imprisonment. There was no bail for those charged.<br /><br />The murder rate in 1973 was 11 per 100,000. It soon rose to 30 and peaked at 40 per 100,000 in 1980. In May 2007 the World Bank issued a report saying, &quot;Murder rates in the Caribbean (it was referring to Jamaica) – at 30 per 100,000 population annually – are higher than for any other region of the world and assault rates, at least based on assaults reported to police, are also significantly above the world average.&quot;<br /><br />The Republic of Ireland banned virtually all firearms in 1973, requiring their surrender within just three days, based on concerns about the IRA. The following year the number of murders doubled and stayed at that level for the next 20 years. Other violent crimes increased as well.<br /><br />In October 2003 the US Centre for Disease Control released a major study on gun control laws in the US in which it reviewed 51 published studies on eight different types of gun laws dating back to the 1970s. It covered firearms bans, ammunition bans, waiting periods, background checks, gun registration, gun owner licensing, right to carry laws, child access-prevention laws, &quot;zero tolerance&quot; of weapons in schools and various combinations of laws.<br /><br />The main outcome was the finding of &quot;insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness&quot; of those laws on violent crimes, suicides and accidental injuries. This despite the huge data set.<br /><br />Since 1999 there have been almost a dozen academic studies of the impact of the Howard gun laws. All used Australian Bureau of Statistics cause of death figures. Probably the most authoritative was a paper by two female researchers, Baker and McPhedran. Peer reviewed and published in a credible journal, it showed no effect of the gun laws.<br /><br />Based on the paper, the head of the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, Dr Don Weatherburn, said:<br /><br />&quot;I too strongly supported the introduction of tougher gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre.<br /><br />&quot;The fact is, however, that the introduction of those laws did not result in any acceleration of the downward trend in gun homicide. They may have reduced the risk of mass shootings but we cannot be sure because no one has done the rigorous statistical work required to verify this possibility.<br /><br />&quot;It is always unpleasant to acknowledge facts that are inconsistent with your own point of view. But I thought that was what distinguished science from popular prejudice.&quot;<br /><br />A 2008 publication (Lee and Suardi) was probably the most statistically exhaustive. It applied a battery of statistical tests to homicide and suicide data for the entire period 1915 to 2004, looking for a break point in the long term trend that could be attributed to the new laws. What they concluded was: &quot;... there is little evidence to suggest that [the National Firearms Agreement] had any significant effects on firearm homicides and suicides. In addition, there also does not appear to be any substitution effects – that reduced access to firearms may have led those bent on committing homicide or suicide to use alternative methods.&quot;<br /><br />Some have pointed to more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings as evidence of the impact. But mass shootings are rare and also did not occur in the 1950s, 60s and 70s despite easy firearm availability and minimal licensing.<br /><br />On the other hand, mass murders have continued since the Howard gun laws. Examples include the Childers backpacker hostel fire and the nursing home fire at Quakers Hill. Furthermore, Australia&#039;s second worst mass murder, after Port Arthur, was a deliberately lit fire at the Whisky a Go Go disco in Brisbane in 1973.<br /><br />It is also false to assume that strict gun laws have prevented massacres elsewhere. Despite tight regulation of firearms in Germany, in Berlin in 1999 a teenager went on a rampage killing 15 people before taking his own life. In 2002 in Erfurt a 19 year-old former student shot 16 people before killing himself.<br /><br />The assumption that guns are freely available throughout America is equally false. Gun laws vary enormously within the country, from virtual prohibition to virtual laissez faire. There are also federal laws that severely restrict ownership of certain firearms.<br /><br />Never acknowledged by those who endorse gun control is the fact that the states and cities with the strictest gun laws are those with the highest violent crime rates. Chief among these are Washington and Chicago.<br /><br />Washington DC has one of the worst murder rates in the country. But the murder rate was declining up to 1976 when a blanket ban on handguns and ready to use long arms was introduced. Between 1976 and 1991 the murder rate rose 200% while the overall US rate rose only 9%.<br /><br />The State of New Hampshire, on the other hand, is one of 41 with a permit system for concealed carry of pistols for self-defence.

				There is absolutely no way introducing new gun laws in the US would make a difference in the murder rate. <br /><br />I have seen some serious vaults of unregistered weaponry and explosives in a couple southern states.. all belonging to a few god fearing squirrel huntin&#039; rednecks who fukin&#039; luv &#039;Merica. There is no way they will give that shit up and it will always find its way into the hands of stupid idiots who are going to cause trouble for innocent people because they needed help they never received. <br /><br />I bet a more effective way to lower murder rates would be to decriminalize/ legalize drug use/possession/distribution!!! :)<br />Most people I know with guns only have them because they deal with illegal drugs. Or just preparing for the zombie apocalypse. <br />

				In the UK it is illegal to hold certain firearms, and illegal to hold/carry any out of the case in a public place.<br /><br />Even illegal to fire legal airguns within so many yards of adjoining property.<br /><br />Currently, the laws state that owning a handgun can give you five years. Not sure if the five means serving one third of the sentance, a third struck off if you don&#039;t kill a cellmate or guard and a thiird outside on a &#039;tag&#039; which is some device locked to the ankle that has a device in your home so you need to be in by a certain time. <br /><br />Shooting someone dead, your doing ten to twenty. Unless your a police informant then the judge would be told and sentance reduced for your cooperative relationship with the police. <br /><br />Even shooting a cop., people can walk even before ten years! So, even cops have not got the golden rule when crfiminals would NEVER want to shoot a cop. that would mean life, gertting out when grey. Now, its not like that and if a young 14 yr old shoots a cop (and one will eventually) they will be out before they are 21.<br /><br />In the UK, we have the army and police to protect us.<br /><br />The army is so many thousands of miles way cleaning up someone elses nation, not ours. So forget the army. They are elsewhere.<br /><br />The police, some are good, some are bad, but I&#039;d sooner face cops with guns that the other people who use them who are farmers (all they have is a 12 bore shotgun and maybe some small calibre rifle) and bad people, usually bad young people, bad males between the ages of 12 to 25. They are the ones who usually shoot each other because they are cowards really and cannot fight. Also, many were &#039;dragged up&#039; not raised. They think being on bail aged 12 is normal. They think snorting a few grams of coke is normal when snorting a few grams of coke (in abouyt 8 hours) would kill you.<br /><br />Its usually the parent(s) who are 100% to blame and who should be made to live in metal containers far from civilisation, perhaps on some remote island off the UK. They breed, we pay for them to breed and the brood can be a burden on us all. I resent working my ass off to pay for other peoples children. Any man who has children ought to do anything to get money! I pay for my kids. I don&#039;t ecpect my neighbour to do it for me. And I know the work is not there. Just saying some parents, would not work if we gave them work on a silver platter. Too much of a distubance on the daytime TV and 4 litre of cider afternoon session!<br /><br />As for guns, hmmm.....<br /><br />Guns make it EASY to kill lots of people.&nbsp; They are made and designed to kill people! So, having been made by the million and sold by the million I am surprised we do not see schools, shopping malls and workplaces shot up more often!<br /><br />I bet that guy in the USA would not have stabbed so many kids - but then again had the school allowed teachers and parents to carry guns, they could have shot the usua 1in tenl fucked up kid on Prozac (or some meds) with a grudge. At that point it was fair to shoot him. But had he lived in the UK, I doubt he would have got a gun. Costs too much and gangsters will not sell to local people who are likely to go el loco!<br /><br />So guns? Would I have one? If it was legal I&#039;d have a collection and once a week or twice, I&#039;d go practice shooting in a licensed place. I know from army buddies how much of a buzz it is to let loose on a machine gun. Love to smoke some hash and play with a few guns, but its illegal, I don&#039;t need a gun to defend my home, I have a good lockl and solid oak door, and a hammer nearby plus a 8 foot pole which I used in martial arts. I&#039;d so fuck up any burglar and without a gun, I&#039;d do him worse! I&#039;d put that pole ,un-lubed- up his burgling ass.<br /><br />He would walk the walk for the rest of his life. He would be &#039;The Stand up guy&#039; because sitting down, he would be in pain. My pain, a gift, to deter him from stealing off other people!!! He should have robbed a bank. <br /><br />In fact, fuck that, I&#039;f cut his dfick off so his possible DNA offspring would not key your car, tear up your plants and piss on the doors of local shops and hang about in gangs throwing shit at passers by. Cutting off his dick would save the tax payers. And give me that space cadet glow! Confidence boosting shit. Cutting off the dick of the burlgar who may have escaped!<br /><br />Cut it off.<br /><br />Pole up the ass<br /><br />Plus, I&#039;d be beating him up also&nbsp; - tied to a chair so I can decide if the police ought to be caught, or would the shithead accuse me of wrong?<br /><br />So off a cliff then I guess. 5 valium in a beer, in the car, trip to the seaside. <br /><br />Winds me up this shit.<br /><br />What the fuckl was this thread on about originally?<br /><br />Ah, gun control.<br /><br />Lucky we aint got no guns here. Us English would be seeing shootings each day just because someone stood on your shadow or the local shop only had green Rizla. Add UK coke to the equation, Friday night out with legal guns would be great for the student surgeons who would have lots of bullet ridden kids to patch up.<br /><br />Giving guns to an average 14 year old I&#039;d expect 1 in 10 to go Columbine.<br /><br />I hate guns myself, they should for killing bears or hunting shit, but we kill each other so maybe its best we have a few trusted people with guns and they can shoot the baddies who always will find guns anyhow. Or should we all have them so we can gang up on any bad people with guns. Or would we shoot our wife/husband in a drunken fight?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Think my wife would do me with an AK47 once a month ;D Hey! Just saying! If men had period we&#039;d want to drop nuclear bombs!<br /><br />Anyway, fuck all this, send me some free drugs, I&#039;ve had nothing here for ages! Used to be when I was liked, now I guess old Red is out of fashion? Well, I got my pole waiting for you if you sell me something bad! I&#039;ll give you ratings alright - right up where the sun doth not shine!<br /><br />So, legalise all guns, or just have a few people have them.<br /><br />Hitletr, Stalin and Mao all stopped private ownership of guns before they went on murder sprees!<br /><br />You can see how unarmed Jews werre not threat to Hitler - makes me mad because in part, I got that Kosher blood also. But my mother was not Jewish but I feel Jewish, when its Jewish holidays, Muslim when its Muslim Eide. and I think Sikh Holy Days and Hindu should be respected.<br /><br />I&#039;m not just getting stomed here! This is worshop of Jah! I say to my wife, STFU, its something holy going on here, let me be! Pass me the lighter!<br /><br />So, peace out,. this BBB oil is insane! So, I&#039;ll sue that vendor - give him the pole, but he might like it - so might you - and as for me - I&#039;m putty in the hands now -= a stoned mess on the sofa, chocolate smears on my face, remote control in my hand, the fizzy drink on my table.<br /><br />A holy mess!<br /><br />So leave me to worship.<br /><br />And the free drugs, samples, I say, hit the Red with some good Karma, just paid a heap of coin for some awful yayo! Restore my faith!<br /><br />Hey men!<br />(Amen, get it?)<br /><br />Fuck you all very&nbsp; much for reading!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The nexy person to comment is itching with a nest of genital fleas.<br /><br />Dare you comment now!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />(do it, do it, do it)<br /><br />And BBB, your oil, its shit! I want my coin back as I feel perfect - and even though my eyes are as red as the fucking setting sun in Africa, and even though I&#039;m crawling to the stereo to put my headphones in, I want more value for money! lol - I lie, its good oil - AAA bud - and I just hope the vendor who done my wife for a gram of yayo is ready to pin back his or her ears!&nbsp; She is going to PM the dude, but, with coke, I&#039;ve ways said, unless its repowdered (crush that block) and washed, it is not always going to give each buyer the same gram. Thiks gram, never seen my wife actually go back for a line every ten minutes!!! 100mg gone , another 50mg and anyway, wrong forum!<br /><br />Guns, yes or no.<br /><br />I say no, wishing we were not so fucked up as to need to kill each other.<br /><br />But the realist, I got a shotgun licencse (in the country its normal) but no shotgun.<br /><br />A shorgun is not considered a self defence weapon really. Too awkward. You only got two chances.<br /><br />Good news is, when it hits it hits. Any burglar ten foot from a shotgun is going to be dead 100%.<br /><br />No need to cut off the dick - but you could behead just to make sure. (bear in mind cops would get a bit sus over that :) )<br /><br />Plus, I got a loved gun, a mighty weapon of love! <br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				The gun freaks in this thread are suggesting the problem can be solved if more citizens carry concealed weapons in public places, so a random nutter with an assault rifle is taken down before he can do any serious damage.<br /><br />Genius !!!<br /><br />&nbsp;::)<br /><br />There&#039;s no justification for widespread gun ownership in a civilised society in the 21st century.&nbsp; As long as the US is awash with guns, gun crime will continue.&nbsp; As has been pointed out already, we still have some gun crime in the UK, but it&#039;s a tiny fraction of that in the US.&nbsp; Hell, the vast majority of our cops don&#039;t carry guns, and I prefer it that way.<br /><br />Edited to add:&nbsp; Today the BBC news web site reports &quot;An 11 year old was arrested near Salt Lake City, Utah, for bringing an unloaded handgun and bullets to school, saying he brought it to protect himself and his friends, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.&quot;<br /><br />This kind of problem is what you get when ownership and concealed carrying of guns is part of the cultural fabric of society.&nbsp;

Ah. Assault rifles typically differ from older rifle types in much higher rof and all-round combat adaptability, not to mention maneuverability due their lighter composition and decreased size. Rifles that don&#039;t fit this category are sniper rifles, Gerunds, those bayonet thingy&#039;s whose name escapes me, shotguns, etc. So, not all rifles are classed as assault rifles.

				It doesn&#039;t matter to me anymore. I, and millions like me, have the guns we need and will pass them down to our children. They could ban them all, but we would be so armed to the teeth it wouldn&#039;t affect us, we&#039;d just become illegal/underground. The underground makes for a freer environment anyway, just like how in the little bubble of strong privacy in the heavily regulated internet that&#039;s probably coming, the &quot;criminals&quot; who use Tor and PGP to make societies like this forum enjoy both freedom and responsibility on a scale inaccessible to most citizens.<br /><br />I will always exercise my right to keep and bear arms, under color of law or no. The millions of responsibly armed, freedom-oriented people along with me, will do the same. Together we&#039;ll have a little bubble safeguarded against tyranny, kind of like what the SilkRoad is in stark contrast to the War on Drugs. Unfortunately, the rest of the world will suffer tyranny, but at this point the way the masses are clamoring to give up their own rights for safety (or, as was the case in Switzerland, they gave up many of their gun-rights not as a reaction to violence but simply because young people weren&#039;t interested), I&#039;m not going to fight the battle for them. The main stream can send itself to hell, my pocket of human freedom is secure. Life in the cracks, if you will. Tthere will always be cracks.<br /><br />I am heavily armed, and that will not change if I wake up a criminal one day. That is the reality for millions of people. The second amendment has served its purpose, we have an armed and free populace and it will not go away no matter what (barring an ENORMOUS fight, daily raids etc. that no politician could justify except in a very different world).<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, I will behave myself. I have no interest in hurting a human being without legitimate cause. I just hope the rest of my fellow criminals can say the same. Since they&#039;ll be pushed outside of any reasonable accountability to the law (like how drug dealers don&#039;t pay taxes, we gun criminals won&#039;t bother with the &quot;reasonable regulations&quot; anymore), you&#039;ll only be able to take their word for it. I hope you feel safer. <br /><br />Mostly I&#039;m just upset that society will hate me for doing nothing wrong. It hurts my feelings. I&#039;ll have to live my ideological life in the closet, because people will shout that disagreeing with them is equivalent to wanting schoolchildren dead. That&#039;s been keeping me up lately. My girlfriend is an anti-gun type who thinks that firing a pistol makes you go insane with a God-complex; I can already see the rift between us growing as this shooting has intensified her emotions. The zeitgeist around tragedies like these, the way people forget about the shooter and think &quot;THOSE DAMN GUNS DID THIS,&quot; more and more of the mainstream forget that you can abhor violence without abhorring guns. To recognize that free people need to be armed is only to acknowledge the unfortunate fact that every society is built on the use or threat of force, but that good people can make a just society by spreading that use of force among a lawful majority rather than a centralized, corruptible elite.&nbsp;

				There are about as many guns as people in the US, so around 300+ million. <br />There will always be unstable people who &quot;flip-out&quot; and kill people.<br />You will not be able to regulate people so it seems the options are increasing gun regulations or getting accustomed to mass shootings.<br /><br />A tidbit to consider apart from that, in the US there are an immense amount of suicides that occur with firearms and those people are often left out of statistics of gunshot deaths.

				No offense but this quote is just made up words with no meaning. The 2nd amendment is the foundation of the constitution and in order to preserve freedom the 2nd amendment is integral.

				Just to clarify, I&#039;m not from the US but from Germany. English in not my native language so I sometimes fuck up explaining things.<br /><br />As I said, enough data has been posted in this thread. My previous post already consists of redundant arguments so please just take the time and read through this thread. If, after that, you&#039;re still convinced of your opinion, there not much I can say to convince you otherwise, especially if you don&#039;t deem my arguments rational and logical and simply ignore the points I make.<br /><br />And stop calling people nuts for not agreeing with you.

				The reality is that if you disarm the people like in the uk you will largely eradicate gun massacres but at the cost of a society increasingly being like a bunch of docile sheep being dictated to by oppresive government. The uk previously had licensed possesion of handguns and a unarmed policeforce , now guns are banned and the police are increasingly becoming armed - not good.<br />Personally i hope the nra can remind some congressmen where there loyalty lies and they can see off the feinstein and obama threat to the 2A. Maybe comprimise with another 1994 style awb - surely everyone has stockpiled enough by now to see them through the next 10 years.

I don&#039;t care if you are Australian and you get a hard on handling a piece of metal, you are in the extreme minority.

The experiences of these abused people are not laughable or comical.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand what you mean by &#039;especially in the grand US of A&#039;. Is it especially unlikely that the US government will not take advantage of us past the point where we would like to resist?<br /><br /><br /><br />On another note: the UK and AUS both have higher violent crime rates then the US. Don&#039;t think you are so much safer because your guns have already been taken away.

IF the 2nd amendment were the foundation of the constitution, then why did they have to amend the constitution to add it, and why is it the second one?<br /><br />I personally feel that it is more than a right to bear arms, It is a responsibility for us to keep them.<br /><br />I also believe there can be a balance between our rights to own guns, and laws controlling their sale and ownership. I don&#039;t see why there is such rage about wanting background checks fun for every gun sale. The only argument that I can even understand for allowing any sale without a check is the argument that the current computer system has random outages which would cost gun show operators money. To that I say suck it up! you chose to be in the business, and that is the nature of it. But why are all these good people so outraged that they have to prove that they aren&#039;t a habitual violent offender before they can purchase a tool that could further enable their violent nature? If they are really such good people, why are they so afraid to prove it? I have zero problem with a background check when I go to purchase deadly weapons, because I know that the reason they are doing those checks are to try to keep those same deadly weapons out of the hands of people who have histories of using violence against others. If that means I have to wait 3 days or 6 weeks, then that is what it takes. Why do people need guns same day? To protect themselves from an imminent threat? If the threat is that imminent, maybe they should ask for help. Now once that background is cleared, I think you should be able to purchase weaponry equivalent to the weapons that governments use, because how are we to protect ourselves from overbearing government without having weaponry that can compete with theirs? <br /><br />Sorry to ramble on and I hope it made sense, but this is a complicated issue and my thoughts on it are equally complicated because I am trying to see the problem from both points of view and I just can&#039;t grasp the points of view from either side completely.

The War on Drugs is total bullshit but the lie is perpetuated by millions of sheep repeating what they have been told. Open your mind. Let the millions of silent guns in America be a testament to the peacefulness of an armed society. One crazed shooter does not make all guns evil, just like one crazed baby-eating crackhead does not make all drugs evil.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why bring drugs into this? Drugs are made by people to make other people happy. Guns are created solely to kill, and in the case of assault rifles to kill humans, by gun companies with lobbying power. How do you bring drugs into this argument unless you know you have lost? genius<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Guns are created because there is a demand for them.<br /><br />I brought drugs in because it is one thing we have in common. Some here espouse the right to the personal freedom to control what goes in their body, but are quick to deny others the right to defend themselves. From my perspective the right to self-defense is a very basic one. I don&#039;t doubt that at least one of those teachers had wished they could have defended themselves and their students in the final moments before that madman killed them and all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is also a demand for meth that does not mean it is smart to use it fuckwit, Im fine with it though because meth is not made for the sole purpose of killing humans, unlike assault rifles.<br /><br />You are right though, if we are serious about tackling gun violence we need more guns in the classroom haha, next brainwave please faggot that one has been tried and beaten<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, there is also a demand for meth. Anything that there is demand for will be available for purchase. Only law abiding citizens do not have access.<br /><br />I see no negative consequences with a teacher carrying a firearm in the classroom, concealed or open. How else would I expect them to protect children from an assailant?

Drugs are made by people to make other people happy. Guns are created solely to kill, and in the case of assault rifles to kill humans, by gun companies with lobbying power. How do you bring drugs into this argument unless you know you have lost? genius<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Guns are created because there is a demand for them.<br /><br />I brought drugs in because it is one thing we have in common. Some here espouse the right to the personal freedom to control what goes in their body, but are quick to deny others the right to defend themselves. From my perspective the right to self-defense is a very basic one. I don&#039;t doubt that at least one of those teachers had wished they could have defended themselves and their students in the final moments before that madman killed them and all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is also a demand for meth that does not mean it is smart to use it fuckwit, Im fine with it though because meth is not made for the sole purpose of killing humans, unlike assault rifles.<br /><br />You are right though, if we are serious about tackling gun violence we need more guns in the classroom haha, next brainwave please faggot that one has been tried and beaten<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, there is also a demand for meth. Anything that there is demand for will be available for purchase. Only law abiding citizens do not have access.<br /><br />I see no negative consequences with a teacher carrying a firearm in the classroom, concealed or open. How else would I expect them to protect children from an assailant?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />haha more great gun loving logic there. Guns are rampant, our schools are not safe, quick, more guns!!!<br /><br />ask an australian how they feel about having teachers armed in the classroom. 99% will say why the fuck would you have a gun near a school? For you see fuckknuckle, america is the only civilised country on this earth with a gun massacre problem haha <br /><br />you are the stupidest cunt you dont even realise that. <br /><br /><br />and btw answer my simple question about the people vs the government, defend your views commando or bow down <br /><br />

Europeans are generally anti-gun and enjoy relatively low crime rates. Also, I&#039;m not talking about rednecks who think guns will protect them against tanks and F-16s, those people are idiots. I&#039;m talking about places like Somalia, where there&#039;s absolute chaos and you need a gun to survive. I would never deny them the right to own a gun, and a government that does is actually oppressing its people. <br /><br />The point is that it depends on context. Some places are so dangerous that guns enhance your safety, others are so safe that they almost exclusively lead to unnecessary suffering. The question is which category American falls into.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />point well taken - too much of the world lives in a dangerous shit hole that most of us&nbsp; Americans - i can&#039;t speak for - Europeans cant fathom. what is really going on outside of our well protected little bubbles? most if not all would find it shocking and abhorrent. i myself refuse to own a television - i find the programming depressing and insulting. i do however from time to time watch some news on the net - it never ceases to amaze me how often i find myself shaking my head in disgust! unfortunately human nature and the propensityof the few - the rare to visit violence and murder of whatever kind upon others will never change. their methods might change but the criminally insane will always, till the end of days, be with us - much to my dismay.&nbsp; unnecessary suffering? do u propose to mean&nbsp; unnecessary suffering from guns?<br /><br />i will tell u - the MOST violent and largest murder of innocent school children happened here in america back in the nineteen twenties. a man that ran for a city council, or a treasurer job, or something like that was pissed he didnt get elected. he went to the nearby school shortly after his loss and went on a killing spree with dynamite. more teachers and children where killed that day than any other time in united states history. that was almost 100 years ago. so tell me - how much has human nature changed in the past 100 years? he didn&#039;t use a gun!<br /><br />i really do appreciate the plight of the poor ravaged african countrys - tibet etc. i feel for all of the peoples of the oppressed world. their suffering pains me to my soul. the whole world is oppressed at this time in history to one degree or another - i fear it will only grow worse for everyone!<br /><br />however my oppression is no less imagined than theirs. i have had the blessing of truly growing up completely free! i grew up in the country and was truly and completely within the constraints of morality - free. even though my oppression fails to compare to the atrocities the other poor souls of this world suffer i find myself resolute to maintain my freedom as it was before the political whores and bureaucrats stole it from me. every year i have less and less of it.<br />i refuse to bend to the will of the few who wish to enslave me.<br />they and their ilk are like a cancer to me that in course must be plucked out and thrown in the waste bin where they belong.<br /><br />your beliefs you are free to keep but time and the ways of the world will eventually find you - for myself i choose freedom. i will have death or freedom. that is my choice and i am proud to have chosen it - if i perish i will still be free and will have my honor and my good word.<br />no mediocrity for me - that is for u sir!<br /><br />EDIT: Merry Christmas;<br />Christy<br /><br />Edit : do u really believe that the &quot; red necks &quot; think they will even be fighting against tanks and F16&#039;s? do u really believe that our military will fight against it&#039;s own people? do u think that anyone that speaks with a southern accent is stupid? who is the idiot?<br />just curious - roflmfao - good 4 u!

				I don&#039;t think guns should be prohibited/controlled more heavily than they are now. While it is true that not having them around would cut down on a lot of impulse shootings, it&#039;s not going to cut down on crime. If someone wants to kill someone, they are going to do it - whether it&#039;s with a bullet, a knife, or their kick ass karate moves and a belt. And those are things more likely to happen on impulse anyway. Even if guns were outlawed, they&#039;ll still exist and people will still be able to get them. Or even make them - something simple is crazy easy to make and it&#039;ll do the job. Anyone who can plan past the day will still be able to commit their crime.

				I think that guns should not be regulated. A lot of non-criminal people like to shoot guns and collect guns, and they should not be stopped simply because they might use guns to commit a crime. If someone wants to kill the most possible people they wouldn&#039;t use a gun anyway, they would use a bomb or possibly poison. It is pretty much obviously true that if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns, it isn&#039;t like a criminal who is going to kill someone with a gun will not do so simply because guns are illegal. It will make it harder to obtain guns but not impossible, after all cocaine is illegal but easily obtained. Additionally they will probably just make a bomb if they are dead set on killing a lot of people. <br /><br />The best solution to prevent school shootings isn&#039;t to control guns but rather to increase security at schools. How much money do they spend on the war on drugs every year? A quick google search gives me a figure of $76.8 billion dollars. A quick google search also reveals that there were 138,925 schools in the USA in 2010, including private and public. If they stopped fighting the war on drugs and redirected a half of the money from a single year fighting the war on drugs to one time school security improvements, that would result in each and every school in the USA obtaining $276,408 for improving their security. That is enough to buy bullet proof doors, windows and strong locks for classrooms.&nbsp; It is enough to have metal detectors at entrances. It is enough to have a computerized system for locking down the school if a major security breach is detected. It is enough to outfit schools with gunshot sound detection systems that could immediately report a shot fired to law enforcement. If each additional year they spent 10% of what they spend on the war on drugs on continuing school security measures, every single school in the USA could afford to have an armed guard on site. Many schools already have police on site and if they are armed as well there will be several armed guards, metal detectors, bullet proof barriers. They could invest in bullet proof lunch trays for children to shield themselves with if attackers come into their cafeteria, after getting their guns past the metal detectors at the entrances and dodging the several armed guards. <br /><br />Why not invest in a system that can detect gunshots and precisely position where they are fired from to automatically deliver an incapacitating agent? Schools are already covered with sprinklers that are capable of delivering fire retardant, why not position them with gunshot detection systems that automatically trigger sprinklers that deliver tear gas to the precise area that the shot was fired from? Then bulletproof the school as well as possible so that shots fired from the outside have trouble to penetrate to the inside of the school? Then the attacker would need to wear a gas mask as well I suppose. Could have it shoot an electrified barb into the person firing the gun, although then it would need to be an even more precise system. Some combination of audio detection for general placement of the shot + CCTV capable of detecting the shape of a gun in that area may be enough to identify the attacker and have a tazer barb fired into them.

				It is very liberal though. Silk Road will consist probably mostly of Liberals with Libertarians a significant minority. Liberals are pro gun control and pro wealth redistribution, but socially they are like a less extreme form of libertarianism. They support gay marriage being legalized and are less concerned about teenage sex than conservatives are but more &#039;worried about the children&#039; than Libertarians are, particularly when they can use this worry to provide jobs to the larger community. They also lean strongly towards at least marijuana being legalized and quite a few of them are for all drugs being legalized. In contrast to Libertarians they want to heavily regulate and tax the legal distribution of marijuana. Most of them who are against legalization are probably mostly worried about the jobs that will be lost if drugs are legalized. At their more extreme end they are the type of people who support the murder of individuals so that they can provide kidneys to the community in order to save two people. However immorally putting the community over the individual is a common trait of liberals despite its degree of expression varying. Liberals can really be split into two camps, liberal-libertarian and liberal-socialist, where the second description is the ideology that compliments their sort of liberalism. Liberal-libertarians are more in favor of relaxing laws that they think have no chance of harming the larger community so they are more individualistic but they will still put the community over the individual in specific cases, gun control being one of them where they see a large threat to the community for an individual right that they see as being needless in a world without civilian access to guns (however the large majority of them are statist enough to think that the government should be well armed), liberal-socialists struggle with a desire to &#039;help&#039; the most people leading them to being quite controlling of the life of an individual (so not only should guns be banned, but so should drugs because they hurt individuals even if they will not have much of an impact outside of the community at large. However, gay marriage would still be seen as acceptable to them, and so would stem cell research). <br /><br />Libertarians are quite liberal in some ways, generally they believe that the rights of the individual outweigh the needs of the community, this means that their opinion on drug legalization coincides more with liberals than conservatives, however unlike liberals they do not think government has a right to tax people for drugs or to regulate the drug trade. Libertarians are also more relaxed than conservatives regarding teenage sex and are fairly close to liberals in regard to their opinions on this, however they are also generally in favor of legalizing possession of all CP and this differs from liberals who are only in favor of CP possession sentences bringing less time than actually molesting children (which contrasts with conservatives). Liberal-libertarians are against the death sentence, in my experience quite a lot of anarcho libertarians are also against the death sentence but largely for different reasons, primarily a distrust of the government rather than seeing human life as too precious to destroy.<br /><br />So pretty much SR appeals to Liberal-Libertarians and there are a ton more of them than actual Libertarians so they will probably be the largest group on SR. Libertarians are also extremely fond of SR , it resonates even more with their ideology than it does with the ideology of liberals (it is a business, not government regulated, run by an individual, not taxed but paid for as a voluntary service, etc). But libertarians are much rarer than liberals so there will be less of them here but they will still be a much more significant percentage of the people here than they are a percentage of people in the typical population. Conservatives will be the rarest group here, most of them are against drugs and religious, most of them support very strong government regulation of the individual but have little concern for the community either, they are mostly interested in the Rich and corporations. A lot of them seem to be brainwashed, and the fact that they are overwhelmingly religious does show a susceptibility to brainwashing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Although I should mention that there are conservative-libertarians as well. They are against taxation of the individual and therefor on this issue they show more concern for individual rights than they do for the needs of the community. They also are for guns remaining legal, largely because they have a strong sense of American patriotism and the constitution of the USA does guarantee them the right to bear arms. Unfortunately they also have a strong sense of patriotism and that means that they are quite concerned with individuals following the letter of the law, which means that they think drug use should be punishable as a crime simply because it is determined by society to be a crime. Patriotism and strong Statism seem to go hand in hand. Also they will still be against things like homosexuality and drugs and sex in general simply because they still tend to be quite religious.

				If you have never heard that libertarians are in favor of decriminalization of CP possession and distribution I wonder how long have you considered yourself to be a libertarian for? How much research have you actually done on what libertarians believe? Because anyone who is against the legalization of child porn possession is not really a &#039;pure&#039; libertarian, and it is quite strongly associated with libertarianism to hold this belief. It is extremely associated with anarchists, you cannot want the censorship of information and really consider your self to be an Anarchist, these things are mutually exclusive. A quick google search confirms that the general libertarian position on CP possession is decriminalization: <br /><br />from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_regarding_child_pornography_laws<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">During the nomination process at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, anarcho-capitalist and U.S. Presidential candidate Mary Ruwart came under fire for her comment in her 1998 book, Short answers to the tough questions, in which she stated her opposition not only to laws against possession of child pornography but even against its production, based on her belief that such laws actually encourage such behavior by increasing prices.[16]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />although it does contrast with this immediately after it<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Shane Cory, on behalf of the minarchist United States Libertarian Party in his role as executive director, issued a response saying, &quot;We have an obligation to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, and we can do this by increasing communication between state and federal agencies to help combat this repulsive industry. While privacy rights should always be respected in the pursuit of child pornographers, more needs to be done to track down and prosecute the twisted individuals who exploit innocent children.&quot;[17] Cory resigned after the party refused to vote on a resolution asking states to strongly enforce existing child porn laws.[18]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would say the first opinion that CP production should be legalized is a very small minority of libertarians, although I have run into a few who think this way (essentially they see themselves as owning their children up to a certain point in time). I know that the ACLU and quite a lot of libertarians are in favor of decriminalization of possession and distribution but distribution legalization may not be the most prevalent libertarian belief. I very rarely find libertarians except a few self professed libertarians here have claimed to be against CP possession legalization. I am not sure what they really are but they don&#039;t appear to be libertarian to me. <br /><br />http://www.aclucentralflorida.org/questions.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[3] Why does the ACLU support pornography?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why are you in favor of child porn?<br />The ACLU does not support pornography.&nbsp; But we do oppose virtually all forms of censorship.&nbsp; Possessing books or films should not make one a criminal.&nbsp; Once society starts censoring &quot;bad&quot; ideas, it becomes very difficult to draw the line.&nbsp; Your idea of what is offensive may be a lot different from your neighbors.&nbsp; The ACLU takes a very purist approach in opposing censorship. Our policy is that possessing pornographic material should not itself be a crime.&nbsp; The best way to combat child pornography is for the government to prosecute those who exploit children by making pornography and we strongly agree with the enforcement of such prosecutions. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />yro.slashdot.org/story/12/09/09/1314232/rick-falkvinge-on-child-porn-and-freedom-of-the-press<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Rick Falkvinge of the Swedish Pirate Party blogs on the subject of freedom of the press and foresees how users of Google glasses could be charged for possession and distribution of illegal porn. &#039;Child pornography is a toxic subject, but a very important one that cannot and should not be ignored.

You are the one who is in favor of criminalizing CP possession and who thinks that possession of CP victimizes children, this is not a common view held in the libertarian community.

Ruwart, the candidate with perhaps the deepest, purest libertarian roots (her rejection of government is so complete that some party moderates have begun warning of the anarchical dangers of &quot;Ruwarchy&quot;). In April, a rival called her out for her thoughts in a 1999 book called Short Answers to the Tough Questions. &quot;Children who willingly participate in sexual acts have the right to make that decision as well, even if it&#039;s distasteful to us personally,&quot; Ruwart wrote. &quot;When we outlaw child pornography, the prices paid for child performers rise, increasing the incentives for parents to use children against their will.&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That view settles better with me than the view that parents own their children, and is probably more prevalent in the libertarian community. <br /><br />http://delawarelibertarian.blogspot.com/2008/03/facing-your-own-ideas-squarely-sean.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Brit Libertarian Sean Gabb has been rather ceremoniously uninvited as a United Kingdom Independence Party speaker because--oh, wow!--they just discovered that he is in favor of drug legalization, eliminating the UK&#039;s race relations laws, and in repealing some child pornography laws.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>[/quote]<br /><br />http://www.mwilliams.info/archive/2004/05/the-dangers-of-libertarianism.php<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Mr. Cramer describes some of the characteristics of a pure libertarian society.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If the objective were really libertarian--the only laws allowed would be those that punished one person directly injuring another--and the Constitution was amended (as it would have to be) to achieve this, I could be philosophic about it, I suppose.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There wouldn&#039;t be any laws against sex in public places, but there also wouldn&#039;t be any laws against carrying a gun for self-defense against criminal attack.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There wouldn&#039;t be any laws against child pornography, but there wouldn&#039;t be any copyright law, either, and a lot of pornography would be much less profitable without copyright.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There wouldn&#039;t be any laws against driving drunk (I mean, you haven&#039;t really hurt anyone until you have an accident), but then again, there wouldn&#039;t be any laws restricting machine gun ownership, either.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There wouldn&#039;t be any sodomy laws (not that I am a fan of those, anyway), but there also wouldn&#039;t be any law requiring you to hire homosexuals, or rent to them, either.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/blog/index.php/2012/02/problem-of-gary-johnsons-libertarian-affiliation/<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If Gary Johnson had remained a Republican or run as an independent or with some coalition party, he might have been worth continued support.

Hell in a taxonomy of child porn offenders I read once they even had a category called &quot;Libertarian Offenders&quot;, people who are not pedophiles but rather stupidly download CP simply because they want to make a statement that they will not be censored and also they want to view information forbidden by the state. They are an extremely small percentage of arrested CP offenders but still made the taxonomy.&nbsp;

If a so-called left-leaning (what a joke!) democrat goes and drops bombs and kills hundreds of people in country A (always under the hypocritical guise of humanitarianism [RTP]!) they will say it&#039;s justified, and if a repub goes and does the same (under naked imperialistic objectives) they will cry, foul! war crimes! And all the while both are underneath it all promoting the same economic wellbeing of corporations and advancing the neoliberal agenda. What crap.<br /><br />They want government to be all-powerful as I said above. In truth, the only way to handle government is to somehow make it large and powerful when dealing with crooked corporations and the like, and small and weak when it comes to trying to dominate the private lives of ordinary people. I wonder if such a thing could be possible. What would it take?<br /><br />At any rate, government now in the US (and come to think of it in all of western &quot;first world&quot; countries), is dysfuctional. In the US at least, there is a clause in the constitution that permits (it obligates really) the people to abolish government when it runs contrary to the interests of the people. Oh, if only that could be implemented.<br /><br />goblin

				Im late to the party but i read the whole thread.&nbsp; I noticed how the anit-gun crew resorted to adhomen attacks, specifically against farmer1, when he brought up good points.<br /><br />Regulation does not work, columbine happened right in the middle of the last assult weapons ban.&nbsp; I find it ironic that there are people who come this forum, that was created to circumvent the prohibition of drugs, to argue for the prohibition of guns.&nbsp; One would have to lack a complete understanding of the supply &amp; demand relationship to think prohibition is a good thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you not see the parallels between gun and drug prohibition?&nbsp; The current booming sales of guns should clearly indicate that even the threat of regulating the supply of guns clearly drives demand through the roof.&nbsp; I cant even find high capacity mags online, they are sold out everywhere.&nbsp; I dont trust the US government and i would never give up my gun.&nbsp; I legaly carry my gun with me everywhere, If someone starts shooting at me, im going to shoot back.<br /><br />Im from the US, it seems most of the anti-gun people here are not from the US, while the majority of US citizens wish to retain their right to bear arms.

I am not sure what they really are but they don&#039;t appear to be libertarian to me. <br /><br />http://www.aclucentralflorida.org/questions.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">[3] Why does the ACLU support pornography?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why are you in favor of child porn?<br />The ACLU does not support pornography.&nbsp; But we do oppose virtually all forms of censorship.&nbsp; Possessing books or films should not make one a criminal.&nbsp; Once society starts censoring &quot;bad&quot; ideas, it becomes very difficult to draw the line.&nbsp; Your idea of what is offensive may be a lot different from your neighbors.&nbsp; The ACLU takes a very purist approach in opposing censorship. Our policy is that possessing pornographic material should not itself be a crime.&nbsp; The best way to combat child pornography is for the government to prosecute those who exploit children by making pornography and we strongly agree with the enforcement of such prosecutions. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />yro.slashdot.org/story/12/09/09/1314232/rick-falkvinge-on-child-porn-and-freedom-of-the-press<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&quot;Rick Falkvinge of the Swedish Pirate Party blogs on the subject of freedom of the press and foresees how users of Google glasses could be charged for possession and distribution of illegal porn. &#039;Child pornography is a toxic subject, but a very important one that cannot and should not be ignored. This is an attempt to bring the topic to a serious discussion, and explain why possession of child pornography need to be re-legalized in the next ten years.&#039;&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />So pretty much you know nothing about what libertarianism actually is, and you are almost certainly not really a libertarian. You are the one who is in favor of criminalizing CP possession and who thinks that possession of CP victimizes children, this is not a common view held in the libertarian community.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Having sex with a child is wrong. The child is no less of a victim because you have a handycam rolling while you are abusing them.&nbsp; Paying someone to abuse a child for your viewing pleasure makes you an accomplice. This is also wrong.<br /><br />Simply having pictures of abuse does not in itself constitute a crime. I am glad the pictures from Abu Ghraib were leaked but that doesn&#039;t mean I think it is ok to take photos while abusing a person. Is this the point you are trying to make? Stating that all Libertarians support child pornography is neither clear nor accurate.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think I was quite clear in saying that Libertarians overwhelmingly support the decriminalization of child pornography possession and the decriminalization of child pornography self production and distribution, quite a lot of them additionally support decriminalizing distribution as well, and the more extreme ones are even in favor of decriminalizing voluntary prostitution between adults and &#039;consenting&#039; children. I don&#039;t see how much more clear or accurate I could be than that? The only case where I said that a libertarian would be in favor of allowing an adult to create child pornography with non-consenting children is a small minority who think that a child is the property of its parents while it relies on them to sustain life. I was additionally quite clear and accurate in saying that this is an extreme view not commonly held by libertarians.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hate to get off topic but damn man you talk some shit. You aint been hanging with libertarians bud you been chilling with rock spiders. Most libertarians realize that a child of a certain young age cant possibly consent. just because a little five year old says ok to his dad/stepdad playing hide the sausage dont mean there is proper consent, otherwise a kidnapper could just say the kid consented when he willingly jumped in the free candy van duh.<br /><br />libertarians overwhelmingly support decrimming of child porn possession? haha keep telling yourself that bud whatever helps you sleep at night. if you are so sure you could start a thread here asking all members who identify as libertarians to say what they think on the subject, if you get 1 in 10 saying they support decrimming child porn possession ill mail you a signed pic of justin beiber or something<br /><br />libertarians overwhelmingly believe you have the right to do pretty much anything you want as long as you dont hurt other people, how is a 6 year old going to deny a few adults who put the fear in him you sick fuck?<br /><br />you might actually be gayer than farmer1

Gee threatened to assault the girl and to use a &quot;stun gun&quot; on her.<br /><br />She ran from the house but Gee chased her down, catching her in the yard and beating her. The girl&#039;s 79-year-old grandfather, who was in the house, came outside to help her. He told Gee to quit beating the girl.<br /><br />According to witnesses, Gee then threatened to use the stun gun on the grandfather. Reaching into his pocket, he approached the 79-year-old who told him several times to stop.<br /><br />The grandfather told police he feared he could not defend himself against the bigger, younger attacker and that he feared the stun gun would kill him due to a heart condition. When the man kept approaching, witnesses said, the grandfather pulled out a handgun and fired one shot. Gee ran into a neighboring yard and collapsed.<br /><br />When police arrived, they attempted life-saving measures but the man died at the scene.<br /><br />The gun was recovered inside the grandfather&#039;s house. The stun gun was recovered from Gee&#039;s pocket.<br /><br />Investigators will complete a case file and forward it to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor&#039;s Office for review.<br /><br />Gee died from cardiac arrhythmia and exsanguination due to a gunshot to the chest, according to a report from the Vanderburgh County Coroner&#039;s Office. An autopsy was performed Monday morning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gee, pardon the pun, I am completely wrong, how could I have been so stupid? If only there was an obvious flaw with that extremely rare scenario. Hmmm, let me think.... redneck fagot like yourself shoots dead his mate or family member in an unprovoked fit of rage, then tells the police he had no choice it was self defence. wow would you look at that, the fact that murderers can claim self defence because their victims are dead just blew your fuckwit analogy out of the water. If only I could reference a high profile story that occurred recently... gee, pardon the pun, let me think.... oh wait, I got it, how about Treyvon Martin and his deadly skittles? yeah, thanks farmer1, I love the stand your ground law, or any shooting where you can only hear one side of the story because the other cunt is dead! its fucken awesome for sociopaths like yourself, wow no wonder America is such a peaceful country with very few gun deaths (you fucking faggot cunt)<br /><br />answer the question I have put to your knowall ass more than once in this thread or fuck off back to your fox news mates because you oviously cant match it with anyone with at least half a brain you child. <br /><br />just to make it clear for you in farmer1 terms, if our &#039;argument&#039; was a gunfight, you would be dead on the ground riddled with bullets and I would be untouched explaining to the officer that this turd was trying to play rambo with his brain but realised he was all out of ammo to begin with<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your argument is flawed because zimmerman has been charged with treyvons death.&nbsp; He will be judged by a jurry of his peers, and if they feel zimmermans life was in danger he will walk.&nbsp; If they feel zimmerman used excessive force, he will go to jail.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like zimmerman was completely unprovoked, have you seen the photos?&nbsp; <br /><br />I really like the insult you have been using, &quot;faggot redneck&quot;.&nbsp; I like it because the terms are pretty exclusive.&nbsp; &quot;Redneck&quot; at least checks out, most rednecks are pro gun.&nbsp; Most homosexuals, or &quot;faggots&quot; as you so eloquently put it, tend to be liberal and vote for gun control. <br /><br />If your argument with farmer1 was a gun fight, how could you win without a gun?&nbsp; You would willingly give up your right to a gun (or brain to carry on your own analogy) while farmer1 clearly has his.&nbsp; If you want to give up your own rights, by all means be my guest.&nbsp; I have a problem when you use your own fear of guns to infringe on my right to own a gun.<br /><br />Also for an FYI, im an atheist.&nbsp; I hate organized religion, the republican party, and fox news.&nbsp; I prefer cnn with that &quot;faggot&quot; anderson cooper.<br /><br />PS Santa just brought me a FN Herstal five-seven pistol.&nbsp; Lower recoil than a 9mm, and it is accurate at up to 100 yards and has a 20 round magazine.&nbsp; U mad bro?<br />
