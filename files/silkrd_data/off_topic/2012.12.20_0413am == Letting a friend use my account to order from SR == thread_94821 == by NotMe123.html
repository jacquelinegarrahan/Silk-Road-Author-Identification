				I&#039;m not saying 100% yes or no but where i&#039;m from if they don&#039;t have ur finger prints inside on the product and you aren&#039;t&nbsp; on the label or anything.. Not shit they could do but hold u for up to 24 hrs.. dont say shit. get a lawyer if anything does hit the bricks.. Some ppl think getting a lawyer automatically tells the cops they are lying but its w/e. I was arrested for something i did not do and was held for 4 hours until my lawyer got there. I walked out the door 10min later

				Well first of all the chances of things going wrong are pretty slim. And if he&#039;s ordering to his address with his name, then I don&#039;t see how you would be in the loop at all. It&#039;s not like anyone can get into your account without your password and figure out your identity. Second of all, if you are so paranoid about this whole thing, why doesn&#039;t your friend just make an account? It takes all of two minutes.<br /><br />But basically to answer your question, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

				i&#039;ve had business dealing with LE before on a few occasions(only twice on drug related when i was younger) and the rest when i was older and know not to say anything, i&#039;m not worried or paranoid about it but was just curious, if for example my friend shit himself and started talking(i know it won;t happen but just hypothetically speaking) and says he used my account, if he can&#039;t log back onto my account and has no proof&nbsp; he used my account, can that still be used in court if he rolled on me to save his arse? i could just say he is full of shit and there is no proof he is telling the truth, basiclly my word against his and since he was the one caught with drugs they would\should believe me.&nbsp; thats my theory anyway. <br /><br />i&#039;m just asking to be ready for worse case scenario.

				i just realised something.<br /><br />what if i buy from a domestic vendor who happens to be LE and they see my buying stats, they will think i am a dealer spending x amount in such a short time.<br /><br />i think it best he opens his own account.

				If you dont admit to anything and just remain silent even if they came to speak with you the issue would die quickly unless you talk.

				I thought about something similar tonight actually...were you hiding in my brain, op?<br />In the past, I&#039;ve ordered more than needed for myself and sold a few. This time around a friend is in need quicker than I am. I thought about shipping to said friend&#039;s house but I thought...what if the pack didn&#039;t make it, the friend missed it, didn&#039;t tell me they got it, blahblahblah...it&#039;s on me and my stats that get fucked. So either I&#039;m going to point friend in SR&#039;s direction to do by him/herself or it&#039;s coming to me first.<br /><br />In saying that, if you truly trust this person with your password, your account, your knowledge of this site, and your stats, go for it. If they&#039;ve never made a purchase and you&#039;re just handing all of your info over to make a purchase they have never done before nor know anything about...I&#039;d be standing over them. Just me...Make sure no one talks obv.<br />If not, do it yourself and deal it to this friend as discretely as possible...<br /><br />Good luck, you should be fine.
