I told that the police, but they did nothing. Now, I am interest in, if is anyone able to help me.I need identifying the area from where that anonym is calling. Can anyone help me or refer me somewhere where I can get a help.<br /><br />Manythanks.

				If the local police do nothing, maybe they are corrupt and want cash? This depends on what country you live in.<br /><br />If that does not work and your life is not in danger by doing so, try to speak to the police chief, or their superior.<br /><br />You could always buy a new mobile phone and/or get a new phone number...<br /><br />Or, you say that you know the phone number of this person is the same each time, get a friend to call this person and say you have some money for them, meet up and get your revenge.

				What did you do to get black mailed?&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; <br />But seriously, you need to get a meeting in person with this guy.&nbsp; So you can have your paid thugs jump him.&nbsp; <br />Hiring thugs is east and cheap.&nbsp; Just gotta get him in person with a cash pay maybe?<br />Get him out in the open first .&nbsp; &nbsp;Then strike. <br />

				thanks guys for the reply.<br />this is not so bad (life is not in danger). I think I know who is it, but I have no proof (I can be wrong also) of it so I do not want to tell that name to the police - and I think that&#039;s why they do not want to speak with me anymore. to be accurate, it is not about me, it&#039;s about my friend. she told me how much it is frustrating and she is so fucked-up by that... she wants help for me so I went here to ask help. she wants to track that phone number to find out who it is. I don&#039;t know where else to go :). point is to get to know who that person is.

				Why not just get a new phonenumber? If the police can&#039;t help, which they probably can&#039;t unless there are any death threats (which you could lie and say that there is, even though it might result it problems later), I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much you can do. It depends on what country you&#039;re from. There might be some websites where you can do a phone number look-up, but it might result in nothing.

				My friend suppose that person who is doing this is inside of her family, so new phone number is not solution because of fact that she/he can find out every new number without suspicion. through websites it is not possible in our country to look it up. so I thought some hacker would help me, but im not sure in these kind of stuff.<br />the police is very wired, we were there once again and there were pretty upset and kick us out... I gotta figure out something, I gotta figure out who that person is and then I can solve whole situation.<br /><br />thanks for your input guys.

				I&#039;ve heard that a lot of these &quot;hang-up&quot; calls are machines determining when you&#039;re home, so that a salesman or bill collector can get you in person. I get these all the time (got one about 2 hours ago in fact). I have wondered if there is such a device (probably is) called a phone bomb where one can trace a number (even if it&#039;s caller-ID spoofed) back to the origin and have the phone(s) at the point of origin ring non-stop. I&#039;d love that...

Unfortunately it turned out to be illegal, so it shut down. And phone-bombing is easy. Just send a fax to a regular phone number.

				My favorite &quot;fax-bomb&quot; has been to fax several copies of multi-page all-black paper to a fax - uses up their toner or ink, both of which are expensive.
