				I answered your questions. I&#039;m just posting here to say that I really really hope you plan on painting Silk Road in a positive light. I&#039;m sick of negative attention from the media, they have no idea what goes on here. I see headlines like, &quot;Silk Road lets users buy heroin, weapons, and child porn&quot; and I just want to slam my head against a brick wall. If you spend enough time here, you&#039;ll see what an awesome community this is. The government should leave this place alone. It&#039;s bringing class and safety to the drug scene.

				I do not understand this.<br />WHY would anyone answer all this.<br />Who is conducting this study and for what purpose exactly.<br />HOW will this help SR or their customers exactly??<br /><br />Seems utterly retarded to even think about collaborating on such research studies.<br /><br />I may be fairly new here but i would like to see SR last and stuff like this seems just too much of a negative risk to me.

				Firstly @ Devinechemicals I agree completely with you what has frustrated me is the mis~reporting about SR, your see from the information I sent you that I have been in the drugs field for over 20 years as a worker and a researcher , I can and will only report the evidence and findings from the individuals who have replied to these questions.<br /><br />Secondly @ Isobetadine I am conducting the research , the research&nbsp; is completely anonymous, I comply with the ethical protocols of the Economic and Social Research Council that means that no participant will be identifiable in any of the research .<br /><br />Why am I doing this , SR first cam to my attention about 12 months ago via a colleague there is alot of misunderstanding and media hysteria about SR and due to this&nbsp; I wanted to write an academic paper which will be based on evidence from the questions , people don&#039;t have to answer all the questions , however I am pleased that I have received so many positive responses. if you wish I can DM you my linkedin profile and you can see the type of work I am involved in. Your also see from my profile I have engaged with other posts as i believe SR to be a vital resource for users

				WHY do you need this information?&nbsp; WHERE will this research be published?&nbsp; A scientific journal?

				@OzFreelancer I know not all journalists are the same but there has been some sensationalist reporting about SR only one or two people have spent any time on SR ...wont name anyone here but we both know a well respected&nbsp; university researcher in Aus who is a mate of mine who has spent any time on here , as well as yourself who has written articles and interviews on SR , I can count on one hand anyone who is reputable, why am I doing this , I have seen a whole new phenomenon and growth in this area and its going to get bigger , as I mentioned there has been misleading reports on SR which I now know to be untrue&nbsp; since being involved in SR , I am now seeing SR as a resource for many people for people needing and wanting advice through the forums , the research is to put this into a academic paper for others to understand , there is alot of interest from others about SR I was at a conference the other week where the main topic of conversation was about SR among researchers and drug workers .<br />

				All right then, well if you are who you say you are then I am sorry I attacked you and I really glad that you are working towards helping decriminalize addiction, drug abuse and recreational drug use.<br /><br />I am sure you of all people can understand, we must to be extremely careful with who we talk to and give even the most seemingly trivial information to.&nbsp; Anyone can claim to be anyone on SR.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that there are hundreds of accounts on SR and here on the forums of agents mining information and trying their best to infiltrate and close SR.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t like we are using Facebook or blogging about celebrities.&nbsp; We are buying illegal drugs and having them shipped across borders.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a felony offense in the US just to place an order since the drugs would be crossing state lines.&nbsp; If a user gets caught with a shipment being delivered to them which crossed state lines of a schedule I or II drug they could technically be charged with trafficking, which is a felony.&nbsp; &nbsp;That not only comes with a prison sentence, but it removes any hopes of ever finding a legit (legal) job that will allow a decent standard of living again (outside of pornography, stripping or maybe being a guinea pig for drug companies).&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I recommend staying away from the questionnaire. The information can be used to lodge an offensive upon SR. Nothing good can come from research like this. It will be generations before people change their attitudes towards taking drugs and purchasing them online. <br /><br />Let this change run the natural course. People on SE are getting sucked into caring about what other people say about SR outside of these forums. Personally I don&#039;t give a toss what they say and will continue on my merry way.<br /><br />The less people know the better. <br /><br />First rule of fight club...
