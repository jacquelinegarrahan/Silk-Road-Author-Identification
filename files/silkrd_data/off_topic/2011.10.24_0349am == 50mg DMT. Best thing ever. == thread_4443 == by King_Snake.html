				I just came down of some DMT from walter(awsome guy) and i immidietly sat down and wrote all of this. i tried to draw some pictures and got soem but got mad that i couldnt draw what i saw. Sorry its a bit incoherent i wanted to get it all down before i forgot(too many cuncussions) anyways. enojy<br /><br />After the 2nd toke I would close my eyes and see these peopel made not out of like light and skin but instead of long rows of line colours fiull lines. They were made out of blackness and rainbow lines that pulsated as they swam and looked at me. They were human. Then they parted and I saw a tunnel that was Time. I was afraid of my own mortality until a candle appeared. A candle of hope. It burned brighter and brighter until it consumed me. Then in a flash I was in a club with girls. Who were also made out of lines and blackness except for their hair, clothes, outlines and makeup. Every so often there was a strobe that would go off and it would flash against the curve of their faces. Everyone moved slowly as though in a trance but dancing to the music that was at full speed. It was astounding. At this point I would look into the strobe(later found it it was my comp) and see move girls smiling at me. It was like a fish eye lens and they would smile at me. Then I opened my eyes. And I just remembered that in order to breathe I had to smoke. So I toked like 7 or 8 or maybe 90000 times. Anyway I opened my eyes to take another toke and it was massive. Then I closed my eyes again and I was in a movie theater. The man from before was back and motioned me to dance with the girls. They looked the same and he looked like he did in the first part all liney. Then He led me back though a panel of light and we were back at the club with a new song. And a new girl She came up to me and I saw it was. Her. The man smiled at me waved and I followed her through an open doorway floating in the sky. I didnâ€™t really see it was her but it had her shape and when I saw her face Her face swam into my vision as though memories were floating past. After I went through the door I think I opened my eyes and my room was full of stars. So much beauty and sparkling a thousand tiny worlds all holding the precious gift of life sanity and intelligence. The power of knowing that im not alone and there are people looking out for is unimaginable. <br /><br />Add in: the people in lines before candle some had bongs for mouths and everyone was laughing.no weed in other more just sensual dancing and slowly. <br /><br />I used a vapor genie and cannabis. worked awesome.<br />
