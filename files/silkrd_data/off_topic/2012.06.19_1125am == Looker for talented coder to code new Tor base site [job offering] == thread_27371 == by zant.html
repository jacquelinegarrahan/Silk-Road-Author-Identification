				Hi I&#039;m new here but I&#039;ll keep it short.<br /><br />I have an idea for a Tor based service but I don&#039;t possess the necessary skills to develop it myself.<br /><br />I can create basic html, css based websites on tor hosted by freedom hosting which is good for a small site (Few pages etc) but doesn&#039;t have the features I require such as Escrow, accounts, feedback system etc.<br /><br />As I don&#039;t have the skills myself but the capital I&#039;m wanting to hire someone to do the work for me. You will be paid anonymously in bitcoins for this project and the work will be ongoing.<br /><br />I will need to see a list of your skills and a resume of your work to hire the right person.<br /><br />my contact email is<br /><br />zant@tormail.org<br /><br />Contact me to discuss what exactly I want to construct as the concept is simple but the execution might be difficult.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you soon.<br /><br />-Zant

				so if you require escrow and a feedback system what will the site be for? pretty much the only things SR doesn&#039;t sell is CP, assassinations and basically anything that purposely harms other people.<br /><br />i think if you elaborate more you&#039;ll get more interest.<br /><br />no offence intended but you stink of bacon to me

As controversial as it is I&#039;d like to sell items that the silk road doesn&#039;t allow yes.<br /><br />It is difficult to find someone and I will only be interacting with them via email and paying them in bitcoins I will not risk a face to face interaction besides we&#039;re probably in completely different countries.

				yeah i said that because you&#039;re asking for a resume. regardless of names on it or not - if someone says &#039;yes i did this site and that site&#039; it&#039;s not difficult contacting the site owners to ask who did it, especially for LE. so it looks pretty difficult to explain how good you are at these things and stay anonymous at the same time.<br /><br />good luck in your venture but i don&#039;t think you&#039;re going to get anyone so unscrupulous as to knock up a website for assassinations / CP here - most of us use this site, amongst other more obvious things of course, because those things aren&#039;t allowed so we don&#039;t have to put up with pedos and the like.<br /><br />even junkies have morals - who&#039;d have thought? ;)
