				http://blog.norml.org/2012/09/25/war-on-medical-cannabis-continues-feds-target-la-dispensaries-for-closure/<br /><br />The LA Weekly is reporting that the list of targets included every single dispensary in the Downtown, Huntington, and Eagle Rock areas of the city. I am not believing this shit. they just want more of the money.

				This assholes are losing and they know it...Look at the CO, OR, and WA initiatives to entirely legalize recreational use of marijuana. Prohibition is finally coming to an end and they are flailing the arms around blindly in a panic cause they knew the FUCKING END IS NIGH!!!!

Can&#039;t wait to see the debates this year and see if this issue is brought up at all or swept under the carpet as in 2008.

				The DEA has threatened states that are actively pushing decriminalization this voting season that they&#039;ll still prosecute people federally for possessing personal amounts of weed, even if the laws do go through.&nbsp; They really are a bunch of cunts.
