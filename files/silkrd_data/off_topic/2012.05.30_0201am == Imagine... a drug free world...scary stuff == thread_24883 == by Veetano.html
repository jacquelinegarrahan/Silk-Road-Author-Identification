				Imagine... a drug free world, how do you think the main political powers would feel about this? Would they... perhaps profit? With their pharmaceuticals that they over charge out the ass for while at the same time poisoning you making you sicker? Sounds like a lot of profit...<br /><br />Imagine they make a website, and deliberately do nothing to stop it&#039;s growth, or disguise its existence... Making it become so popular that everyone uses it... and users will think feds just can&#039;t do anything about it... <br /><br />So this popular website grows and becomes so known that any possible drug user with access to the internet will access... Bitcoin businesses become booming make tons of profit. So after a couple years, some feds where managing this website... collecting tons and tons of information about drug users... they one day pass some ridiculous bill that gives them unstoppable power, which they use to imprison any person who has ever used the site.<br /><br />The economy would be completely dominated by big business and big wealthy families. The black market would become nuked and any money stuck in a bitcoin market would go to the owner... and what if those owners were feds? Even more wealthy for the wealthy.<br /><br />A greater than 90% irradication of all drug users and producers in the world if they website becomes known enough. Without the black market running it&#039;s biggest primary source of economy, it would be gone, and the wealthy would get even richer in their monopoly on the economy. <br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry I was super high and felt like I could make some crazy shit up :)....<br /><br />Though if you consider the fact that some people in major power will be willing to go to any lengths ever to gain more wealth and material, even as far as mass imprisonment or mass genocide.<br /><br />The fewer people their are in the economy the more money a single individual at the top will gain, because of more free floating money and fewer production sources.
