				To be honest I&#039;m not overly bothered about it. If the owner of the site can&#039;t be bothered to keep his willy stiff then soon enough no fanny is going to want to sit on it. Just annoys me that I can&#039;t even deal with the fucking disputes when I can&#039;t actually get the site up. <br /><br />FOOOOK IT. No traffic or trade on there anyway, the BMR forum is dead too. Fucking weird shit on there too, hit-men and all that kind of crap. Obviously they are all scammers but still. Bit much.

The thing is with BMR is that that doesn&#039;t even work when I do this and I haven&#039;t been able to get in for days at a time when I have been able to get on SR easily. Overall it&#039;s just more hassle than it&#039;s worth IMO, gunna stick with SR.<br />

				Not that simple, as I said I wasn&#039;t able to access this forum for a week and was able to access SR main, BMR, TorDir and almost everything around. I was doing that switch identity thing over and over but no way to get a hook here.<br />The Tor network has this price for anonymity, all it takes is to get hooked in the wrong bridge, like one doing traffic shaping or sharing too few bandwidth and you can&#039;t access it anymore.<br />Did you gave a try on access BMR from i2p, heard its faster, but didn&#039;t try it yet.

				That&#039;s true, BMR has much smaller userbase than SR. Which can be good, you couldn&#039;t see those major scams going on there as here, scammers are normally weeded of after 1 or 2 sales, way before they do any serious damage. I&#039;d some orders where I was refunded from escrow there (I NEVER FE to nobody no matter the reviews), mostly because of those guys trying to scam a few coins with &quot;free samples&quot;. <br />However from the seller POV, I guess it&#039;s a bad thing, the major the better, right?<br />Bottom line, for my private use BMR suits well the purpose without the need for much hassle with a crowded market, for wholesale, if one of these says I need it, I&#039;ll go on SR.<br /><br />Side note; I fucking love the admin there because I love rough people. I&#039;m kind a sick with people that &quot;smiles at your face while sticks a dick up your ass&quot;. Barbarians FTW! But that&#039;s just me...&nbsp; ;D

If you don&#039;t want to keep me safe the fuck off. I don&#039;t ask for FE unless I have to either. Only times I do is either if you have 0-5 transaction history but I insist on recorded delivery too or if I had to buy something in for the customer. Apart from that I don&#039;t/wont demand it. <br /><br />Also sorry if I shouted at you in your thread the other day. Was just fed of having Tony&#039;s name rape my eyes over and over again lol.

Rough people has the power to surprise you in a positive way, whereas apparently friendly people have the power to disappoint you.

				That one of &quot;LE posing as vendors&quot; is the most non-sense I&#039;d ever read man.<br />First at Europe, where I&#039;m from, it&#039;s not even forbidden to buy drugs, it&#039;s forbidden to sell them. So nothing to gain here. For US any good attorney would bend the case stating that you just committed a crime because the agent, so the agent is the part to blame upon the crime committed. Like «oh no!

				I was going to give them a go, as I have a moderate collection of various unopened pharms that I would like to sell, but not enough to purchase an account here, because I would be done vending once these were gone. I know they do not make you pay to open a vendor account, but now I am wondering if I should just count my lossess as far as these pharms go. So, from what I am reading, the general consensus is that BMR is not worth my time?

If you ever remember him spamming 4chan 5yrs ago you would instantly recognize his very poor attempt at making a new identity with BMR<br /><br />Go on the forums and post something with spelling error and end every sentence with lulz. Watch him rage.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Kimmo?!?&nbsp; That is a name I never thought I would hear again... whataprick... that guy is a good example of cancer

				There&#039;s nothing to lose sickgirl. As you said they don&#039;t make you pay for a seller account.<br />About Kimmo, backopy already said about 1000x he isn&#039;t that guy. Wonder why some keep calling him that... my guess is that they wish that 4chan guy to get arrested on his behalf and my guess also is that if that Kimmo was running BMR he would be arrested already, as everyone knows pretty well who he is.<br />

				oops, didn&#039;t see the other question. Kimmo is the lovely douchbag that ran the AnonTalk board. He is a scammer, a shittalker, and rumours that I have heard, a snitch and a pedo.&nbsp; Basically, a total prick. If you ran into him once, you would not forget it...

				Fair enough. Google is our brother it seems. <br /><br />And no way could someone that publicly accessible could run BMR. Well if they did it&#039;d be fucking stupid.

				LOL I said the same thing....<br /><br />I didn&#039;t even make a sale on it... its such brutal layout of the site..<br />only feature I like is ability to finalize early, but you can select the amount, and it also gives you cost of postage up front so that helps when xpress post to USA is 35$/each....
