				To me all of these morons who sit in the off topic section and waste each others time thereby boosting each others post count and karma just need to find their own forum.&nbsp; Their posts are utterly useless and for some reason they think that they&#039;re &quot;respected members of the community&quot; despite the fact that not a single one of their posts has helped anyone.&nbsp; They barely ever post product reviews and never useful information regarding anything else and yet everyone is expected to respect them for the fact that they&#039;ve wasted most of the last year or so posting bullshit to eachother.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t they go find their own forum for that shit?&nbsp; Why should those posts or posts in the off topic section count towards community standing?&nbsp; Pointless bullshit posts and the fact that they&#039;re all constantly giving each other plus karma shouldn&#039;t go towards community standings at all.&nbsp; Things like product reviews, useful security info, and drug safety info should.<br /><br />Here&#039;s another group of people that need to fuck off to the clearweb already.&nbsp; There is a surprisingly large number of people on these forums who are only here to wax philosophical as if anyone gives a fuck about their opinions about economics, governments/politics, and other things.&nbsp; A lot of these people don&#039;t even do drugs and yet for some reason here they are on a drugs forum ranting about the free market or whatever other bullshit that people don&#039;t want to hear about to everyone dumb enough to click on the wrong link.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t they go find a forum dedicated to those things?<br /><br />The only things that should have any validity on these forums are product and vendor based reviews and to some degree security and drug safety information.&nbsp; All of the shit chatting and lame waxing philosophical that goes on in these forums shouldn&#039;t count towards how respected a member is and shouldn&#039;t even be here.&nbsp; Personally I respect a user with 50 posts that include well worded reviews and useful information a lot more than all of the morons around here who have 1000 posts and +100 karma because almost all of them just sit in the off topic section or rant about bullshit trying to convince a bunch of anonymous forum members that they&#039;re the next Nietzsche.&nbsp; So I say that those two groups should have their own forum for wasting their entire life on an anonymous forum so that these pointless posts don&#039;t count towards their standings on a drugs forum anymore.

				The more you post, the better typecasting profile LE will have on you. The forum should be used for information about products, their use, and vendor discussion. <br /><br />You know LE are on the forum. You know they are posting, manipulating every single one of us. If you think you are smart enough to avoid it, then you are already putty in their hands.

Sounds like he is more upset about the fact that people come in here for 2 months racking up 1000 posts and karma from sucking each other off then thinking they&#039;re respected members. He is obviously butthurt that no one respects him, why else would he make a rant about this shit?

				AND karma points don&#039;t make you trustworthy, PERIOD. your comments and ability to be trusted make you trustworthy. The karma just adds a bit of fun to the forum, but this forum (and a few others) are like family to me, and I will talk to my family about whatever I god damn please!<br /><br />now he has me on a rant. at least it is in the off topic section, so he won&#039;t confuse it with a vendor review or opsec guide

				I must say, I did giggle at &quot;wannabe philosophers. &quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s called off-topic for a reason though! <br /><br />The level some posters reveal about themselves is pretty alarming though.
