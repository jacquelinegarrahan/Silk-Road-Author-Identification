				Just some weak vicodins.. This reminds me of a story from a couple days after I had gotten my wisdom teeth removed... the horror.<br /><br />I took a big swig of what I thought was a soda. Well it turns out it was my friends DIP spit, I started barfing it up violently (if you&#039;ve ever drank dip spit you know it has the most disgusting consistency/taste imaginable...). My face was still all sorts of fucked up from the surgery and I couldn&#039;t open my mouth all the way but the violent puking forced it open, which ripped out all my stitches so my mouth turned into a bloody dip spit mess. I&#039;ve had better days.&nbsp; :-X

				My sympathies. It&#039;s been years since I had my wisdom teeth pulled. Mine had crazy long roots that had grown into my jaw bone, so they had to break them up with what looked a lot like a pair of pliers before they could be pulled. Also, I think they screwed up somehow with the Novocaine (which tastes absolutely vile, for any who haven&#039;t had the pleasure),&nbsp; because my face and tongue were completely numb but I could still feel a fair amount of pain in my jaw. <br /><br />They gave me Vicodin for it, which I only took for a day and a half. Being constipated and sleepy all the time ain&#039;t my idea of a good time. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend edibles, or making a gravity bong, for your weed needs. You really don&#039;t want dry socket.

How many people do you think have had their wisdom teeth pulled in the last few days? I wager quite a few.. more than enough to ensure anonymity.<br />&nbsp;Anyway, who&#039;s watching? Come to think of it who is going to go ask the judge for the court order to see the records of all the dentists performing wisdom teeth removal? I mean, then who is going to cross reference those records with the posts in this thread, then somehow run up some charges, with no evidence of wrongdoing mind you... then locate the individual from the questionable post and prosecute him/her to the fullest extent of the law... somehow...<br />I think that the people outing vendor stealth methods, or trying to back clearweb exposure as &quot;good for the revolution&quot;, or talking to reporters, or using their moms computer, or dribbling on reddit, or putting posters of green camels on their walls, or failing to learn pgp/gpg are probably in more peril than people bullshitting about wisdom teeth..<br /><br />Idk, I am all about safety and staying anonymous, but I don&#039;t think calling us &quot;newbs&quot; and damning a fairly harmless thread is all that constructive. By the way, did you know that I have had my tonsils out sometime in the last 7 years?&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; <br />

				I had upper 2 pulled at same time - your dentist gives fuck all and your doctor will likely only prescribe some weak ass shit like co-codamol. Get some dihydrocodeine (df118s) - I&#039;m sure u&#039;ll find them on the Road. Typically each tab has 30mg of codeine in them - 3 or 4 of these and u ain&#039;t feeling fuck all.&nbsp; Worked for me. And u can get 60mg and 120mg time release tablets but 30s kick in quicker and legs face it with toothache u want it gone pronto. <br /><br />Either that or get a load of benzos and stay relatively unconscious until the swelling and pain has subsided and passed. <br /><br />

				There&#039;s nothing &quot;very unique&quot; about getting your wisdom teeth pulled, or any of the common problems that lead to having them pulled. Roughly 10 million people get their wisdom teeth yanked every year in the US alone. Tens of thousands of people a day. As one data point among many it might be used to establish a profile (most people get their wisdom teeth removed between 16 and 25), but the same can be said for a lot of what people share on here. <br /><br />Even if someone were stupid enough to post a dental x-ray on here, it would be useless to law enforcement without other identifying information that would allow them to narrow their search considerably. And if they had enough information to get a warrant on dental records in your local area, said person would be well and truly fucked already.

				Im gonna have to get them removed sometime soon.. Not sure if i should order some opiates. I have never fucked with that shit and i dont want to start now. I think i have good self control when it comes to drugs. I always have mdma in my house but i limit my use to once a month at most even tho i have friends doing it all the time... Never got addicted to cigarettes I but smoke them all the time.&nbsp; But then again i have no idea just how addicting oxy really is as i only tried it once as a goof and didnt even get high really till i smoked weed.<br /><br />Is it really that painful? Would smoking a shit ton of weed help? or is a higher dose than what they give you required? If I order some percs how much should i go for and how quick do you become a junky?

				if you have good self-control with drugs, then you will probably be fine with whatever that give you. i don&#039;t have good self-control with drugs, and that&#039;s why i blasted through my opiates. if you don&#039;t have experience with opiates, you probably wouldn&#039;t need anything stronger than vicodin or the like. its really not all that bad after the first day or two, but you will be sore. i wish i had made my vicidin last at least a couple more days, because i was pretty uncomfortable. but yeah. after that, tylenol and/or aleve should do ya just fine. <br />smoking is a big no no for the first couple days, look up &quot;dry socket&quot;. i was stupid to smoke the next day.

				Mine was painful for the first few days, the hospital gave me co codamols to take home, but I procured some tramadols (tramadols are quite nice, not strictly an opiate, I think they are classed as a synthetic opioid - someone correct me if im wrong on this ) and used those instead - did the trick nicely. I had a tattoo booked the next day too which i didnt want to miss as there is a 3+ month waiting list at the studio - the tramadols helped with that quite alot too. Anyways after a few days the pain started coming back and gradually getting worse and worse in a couple of the teeth, awful pain radiating out to my ears, turns out i had dry socket - fucking horrible. Getting slowly better now though although I best be careful now as LE will be checking every hospital worldwide for patients who had all four removed and then went back with dry socket.
