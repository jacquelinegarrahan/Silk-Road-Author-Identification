				Around the holidays I like to analyze where my life is now, where it&#039;s been, and where I want it to go.<br />We all have big dreams, without dreams there&#039;s no ambition, and without ambition there&#039;s no motivation to do anything.<br /><br />I remember as a little one that I had always wanted to be an architect. Going to MIT was my dream. <br />Although I am in a related business now, I&#039;m not designing the modern homes I visualized in my head as a little one.<br /><br />What did you all want to be?

				I wanted to be a pirate. Watched all related movies and had some books in this field. Also had some pretty deep dreams about this thing which affected me years after I could say. I was five then. Now I can see it was not that who I wanted to be but who I really am. Not the way I am pirate now but yeah, never wanted to be a cop too when playing cops and robbers game, just sought some freedom. And now I&#039;m here, planning a trip around the world, never going to work again.

				I wanted to be a fighter pilot....now I realize that the military complex is a system I don&#039;t want to be a part of, and there is no such thing as dog fighting anymore. It&#039;s pretty much just shooting sitting ducks.<br /><br />I&#039;m studying geosciences now.
