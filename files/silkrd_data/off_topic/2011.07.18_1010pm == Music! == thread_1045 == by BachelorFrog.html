				I always listen to MJOLLNIR mixes on Dissociatives. Face Melt, Straight Filth and Meltdown are the mixes I have, they are about 1 hour long each and easy to find on demonoid. <br />Also always looking for good Dubstep mixes for psychoactive experiences. :D

				Yea, I love bass and can&#039;t get enough of dubstep now.&nbsp; Shrooms would be cool for a first psychedelic experience. I saw Umphrey&#039;s Mcgee for the first time at a music festival the first time I took shrooms and I now know the meaning of face melting, haha.&nbsp; Just make sure that you at least take an eighth if you want some visuals and that you have a trip sitter with you too, because even when you&#039;re in a good mood and have no bad vibes, the shrooms can still turn on you believe it or not.&nbsp; I would recommend acid for your first trip though, that&#039;s the route I took.&nbsp; I think music sounds a lot better on the acid trip rather than the shroom trip, granted shrooms still make music sound amazing, and you&#039;re not going to get any real hallucinations (if that makes any sense) on acid until you take the higher doses.&nbsp; You&#039;ll still have a lot of visuals and see changing colors and stuff and still trip from a tab or two your first time, but it&#039;s a lot easier to handle and control compared to shrooms on the lower doses.&nbsp; I would highly recommend listening to Deadmau5 during your first trip for a little bit, especially on acid.&nbsp; His music is just so... full. Anything from his new album to his other hits are just amazing and are completely mind blowing when you&#039;re tripping and if you&#039;re by yourself, definitely sets a good atmosphere for meditating.<br /><br /><br />I do have to say though, I like skrillex as a musician and he has some good songs, but he sucks as a dj.&nbsp; He messed up a couple times when I saw him, lol, and he dropped a lot of stuff that wasn&#039;t even his.&nbsp;

				I happen to think the opposite Mr. M4y0rMcCh335E, I think shrooms are much easier to handle at a music festival at low or high doses than lsd at low or high doses. I have taken both many times, at festivals and just chilling out, and I have had far more moments of complete ego death on lsd during my peak (granted, the hits I&#039;ve taken are usually very potent) than i ever did on mushrooms&nbsp; (at low and high doses). <br /><br />I don&#039;t know, i guess to me mushrooms are always non stop giggles, and lsd is just complete sensory overload, with a crazy mindfuck. I still prefer lsd over mushrooms anyday! To me, LSD is king, and I think it is a MUCH better festival drug than mushrooms. However, if it is a long festival, i say do both :)<br /><br />And there is much better music out there than &quot;skrillex&quot;. I don&#039;t even dare call him dubstep, he is brostep to me... <br /><br />I like this type of stuff... i&#039;ll post a link (but yeah, don&#039;t access it through tor...)<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqg7qyrcMvQ<br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />

				I&#039;m agreeable with everything up top so far. I&#039;m listening to Washed Out right now but I listen to most anything, mind you. I don&#039;t know why but I download more music than I&#039;ll probably ever get around to listen to more than once, unless I really like it of course... such as Washed Out. Heh.
