				So i seen the news and naturally assumed it was HAARP<br />After a google search &#039;Iran HAARP&#039; , articles and forums posts from 2010 predict its use on Iran.<br /><br />Just something else i found interesting.<br />http://canadanewslibre.com/2012/08/11/2012-08-11-iran-earthquakes-related-to-haarp-tectonic-warfare/ <br /><br /><br />What do you people think? I&#039;m convinced this wasn&#039;t a natural occurrence..

				In the 60&#039;s when phone companies were starting research on cordless telephones (eventually cell phones), people thought they were throwing their profits away investing in such ridiculous R&amp;D.<br />So is it a stretch to imagine concentrated beams shot into the earths ionosphere could potentially affect weather? People thought Einstein was crazy at first, maybe he was, but he was also right about many of his theories. I guess all I&#039;m saying is I wouldn&#039;t be so quick to dismiss theories about these kinds of things. I personally don&#039;t worry about shit I can&#039;t control, I do like discussing them sometimes though. I&#039;d be willing to bet there&#039;s some hacker out there in some basement that&#039;s found some very interesting classified shit that could prove a conspiracy theory to be true. Classified enough to kill for, which is why they keep their&nbsp; :-X.

				No.<br /><br />http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4122<br /><br />the &quot;Hey they thought Einstein was crazy&quot; argument is kind of tired because<br /><br />a) they didn&#039;t. Einsteins theorys were based on some extremely sound mathematics and were difficult to dispute. <br /><br />b) even if they had, the logic doesn&#039;t work the other way.<br /><br />Einstein was thought crazy= Einstein was a genius and his theory was true<br /><br />DOES NOT MEAN THAT<br /><br />Crackpot A is thought crazy= Crackpot A is a genius and his theory is true.<br />

				I came across HAARP a long time ago and i reckon its probably true.<br />Although why they would use a device to do this is beyond me.
