				a gook woman decide notb to pay me $50 and i dont think id get awawy with charging her $1000 per day late fees so i decided i might let low for a little while and then buy a big can of paint and some kind of supersoaker and givve her car/garagehouse walls a good soaking with some paint so she pays a few grand or some major hassle for hubby to remove it all. i dont really like mail order bride gooks that dont pay up.<br /><br /><br />checked the [place out and its a open garage so im&nbsp; not evil enough to use fire and put anybody at harm so aint will do. <br /><br />whats the best type of paint i should buy that will be the hardest to remove for them. what is it going to take to have it removed from being supsoaker all over brickwork, the back of their car and all inside their garage. i&#039;ll even do the front of their house if i get the chance. ill buy 2 cans of paint if i have to..<br /><br />a nice red paint will do<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure but startpage it and u will find your answer. Just make you use tor and clear out your browser after. Watch your ass when you do it be like seal team 6. Don&#039;t under estimate your enemy and police, their is no room for error expect the unexpected take it seriously treat it like a military mission. Do your recon plan leave no evidence or no man behind. Have a alibi just in case with someone and plan exactly what you may say including times you were their. <br /><br />Gentlemen you are America&#039;s best make us proud! Hollywood, Ice sec-rotor 2 and Maverick you back him up with Merlin on ready 5. Rise!<br /><br />Sorry had a top fun flash back anyways plus its fun that way!

				Over $50? No typo, that&#039;s the correct amount that you&#039;re stressing over? Sorry to hear that.<br /><br />Oil paint will be better, should be able to use in a supersoaker, will be much harder to clean that latex-based. Depending on where you live, it may have to be asked for at the lumber yard / hardware store rather than out on the shelf. Don&#039;t bother getting it tinted, just buy a small can of a dark color.

				Strictly in the technical sense, look for something like marhyde paint stripper. That stuff is extremely nasty to car paint, it will make it bubble and peel right off anywhere it gets on the paint, even a little pindrop. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the same stuff anymore with the VOC regulations and whatnot, but 15 years ago, that stuff was great for paint job prep.

				i think someone has to step in and say you shouldn&#039;t ruin a car over $50. I know it sucks, but just like you should try to pay it forward, you should try not to hurt it forward. She&#039;ll have a bad day and take it out on someone else and so on. I&#039;ll stop preaching now.

				If you want some extra fun, take a hammer to the porcelain around a spark plug and break it into some chunks. Fire one of these at the car windshield/window with a slingshot and it will shatter the safety glass easily and more completely than a rock.
