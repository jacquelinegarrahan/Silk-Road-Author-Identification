				I locked it because you claimed to be LE, said you bought a bunch of vendor accounts, and would see everyone behind bars.

				You can&#039;t get anything of probative value that way. I&#039;m sure idiots like you order drugs to their enemies. This site is probably a weapon to you. To everyone with a brain, it is a piss weak one.

				Not sure for all country&#039;s, but i thought most country&#039;s have a law that says something like &#039; a police officer cannot partake in an illegal activity to try to arreet someone&#039; so for most european country&#039;s even if there were cops wanting to do this, they could not. <br /><br />And also, you are a big fake. Or just some real police officer trying to scare people off, but you know you cannot do what you say there. <br /><br />Well can&#039;t speak of the USA/AUS but i know for sure that such a thing isn&#039;t allowed by LE in The Netherlands, Belgium etc..<br /><br />So go scr*w yourself fake mister officer, I bet you tried to become an officer but you failed at the tests, over and over, now trying to act like a real officer behind your keyboard&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:)
