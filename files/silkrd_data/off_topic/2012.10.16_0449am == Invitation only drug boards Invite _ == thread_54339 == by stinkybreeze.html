				<br />I have heard from others on here that this exists. IF......anyone would care to send an invite please contact me by PM. I would love to have more options. I feel that at an invite only board, there would be a higher seller/buyer trust involved. I am domestic. Thanks for reading.

				gosh I hate to jump on the me-too wagon, but I would like to know. Loyal customer here and will stay so, but there are some things I can&#039;t find here. Many of the things I can&#039;t find I need an &quot;offshore&quot; pharmacy for. I had seen some of them listed here a long time ago, but not since (example: Prednisone which I need for a very old animal in pain).

				This sounds like a bad idea.<br /><br />If there is a place where people are being let in based on trust, then that mean you may extend more trust to the people let in.<br /><br />In other words the secret LE users here will probably be devoting their life to getting in, then you may be extend more trust to the wrong people.<br /><br />

				Even if you guys did manage to get &quot;invited&quot; to a private board none of the vendors would probably do business with you. The ones I&#039;m aware of the vendors have to have people actually vouch for you to place an order. It&#039;s kinda like getting into a supply chain and you can&#039;t just order personal amounts, it&#039;s mostly bulk.<br /><br />Other then that there&#039;s a few random boards that are really small that will sell personal amounts but you&#039;re not going to get into them just randomly asking on silk road, that&#039;s not how it works but good luck.

				Private forums work on invitation only as a way of verifying the people coming in. They arent going to invite people from public boards that have only been open 1 year.<br /><br />The advantages of private boards is the trust factor allows business to be conducted in simpler methods ( cash for product on large scales ).<br /><br />

				I will be frank.<br /><br />I want a forum that caters to DEALERS!<br /><br />There have to be forums, like SR, for people who are running a real life enterprise but prefer to have their wares shipped to a location and they have the option to hand to hand or ship themselves.<br /><br />If anyone knows about THAT, pm me.<br /><br />This retail sh!t&#039;s RIDICULOUS!<br /><br />Long live SR, though......long live SR.........

				SSB, that is essentially what the private forums are. They are bulk quantity, cash trade deals that mostly go on there. People know eachothers names, most have phone numbers for dudes, all communication is PGP and the deals get done.

				To each there own, sure.<br /><br />I was responding to SSB&#039;s want for a DEALERS board ...and when you get to a certain level, BTC/SR etc just dont work. Your not gonna find really good deals on multiples or even single KG&#039;s of MDMA here, 10pks of weed, half bricks of high heat coke ... things like that. <br /><br />A private board mainly deals with large players who buy from a suppliers who mainly work online bulk and then they take that work offline for resale. At that level, cash is king. Not alot of people want 100k of BTC lol.

				Just work your way up with buys on SR through the bigger vendors is the best advice I could give. Almost all of them are tapped into a private forum or two and have come here under other ID&#039;s to sell off product at the high retail prices offered.<br /><br />The point of private forums is complete trust in everyone on there which allows business to flow seamlessly.

Too limited in your choices here or just not exclusive enough to make you feel important. Get a clue and leave the business to the ones that a) know what they are doing b) have worked hard to get the trust and respect of their peers and c) are playing for keeps not just a weekend getting on it. Buying drugs at the end user level /= knowing what your doing either btw.<br /><br />just pisses me off so much that people can&#039;t understand that you cannot rush things in this game. For good reason!!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;To you its a possession charge and &#039;oh noes my life is ruined&#039; but some of these people will never see freedom again if they are done.&nbsp; Fuck for some its literally life or death... I can see some rolling their eyes and that&#039;s cool. If you don&#039;t know/understand then you are just proving why its a wise thing to keep even the mid level distro people out of reach of 99% of the general drug taking community and why from there up its enter at your own risk and vouch for no one unless your willing to stake your ass on them.<br /><br />/end rantt<br />/ignore thread

				private forums come to you, you don&#039;t come to them. Unless you make your own. Then you can come to other people. I suggest that you don&#039;t go to random fucks on SR asking to get onto private forums. the cycle continues...

				My thoughts on this have already been said by a couple other members.<br /><br />Instead of being so eager to join these private boards, first work on your current connections with Silk Road and/or other sites you play this game on. If the game thinks you&#039;re good enough, opportunities will come to you. And it&#039;s not about being &quot;good&quot;... it&#039;s about being smart and keeping your head up. Never let your ego get to you either. Could go on about this all day, but I&#039;d rather go smoke this cigar. :P
