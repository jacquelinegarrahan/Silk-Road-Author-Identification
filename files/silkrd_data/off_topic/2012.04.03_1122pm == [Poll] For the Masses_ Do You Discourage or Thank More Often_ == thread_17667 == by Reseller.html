				I &quot;thank&quot; fairly often because I know everyone likes to get good karma, regardless of how much they might deny even caring about it.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I particularly like to give posikarma to someone who gets kicked in the head for little or no reason at all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only &quot;discouraged&quot; once, and I was pretty damned irate at the time.&nbsp; I don&#039;t give negakarma just because I disagree with, or even dislike someone.&nbsp; They have to really be trying to be a douche bag.<br /><br />I just gave you posikarma...&nbsp; You know you like it.

				I can&#039;t do either here yet cos I&#039;m a new user, but I picked option 4, as I intend to deal only in positives here. <br /><br />If I was to give out a negative, it would only be given to scammers, or really nasty cunts.

				I only dole out &quot;posikarma.&quot; (coined by cacoethes&nbsp; [+ posikarma, my friend]).<br /><br />I&#039;d rather discuss with someone why I have misgivings about something they posted. Sometimes through discussion you learn that they either didn&#039;t articulate themself well enough or you didn&#039;t understand or mistook what they meant or intended. Or you simply come to a mutual and respectful understanding.

				@ Cacoethes, +1 to you for coining the name posikarma.<br /><br />@ UKGrower: Totally in agreement with you.<br /><br />@BenJesuit: Exactly. I do not see the benefit of publicly &#039;negging&#039; someone when I could confront them over PM about the problem.

				Also voted 4 because I would give posikarma if I could. But I would probably neg a scammer.

				If I read a post that contains interesting/helpful information, or links to interesting/helpful information, I&#039;ll often raise karma. Or if I&#039;m arguing with someone and they remain civil, that&#039;s awesome in my book.<br /><br />If someone is flat-out acting like a douche, not necessarily to me, I will discourage them. I probably shouldn&#039;t, since I don&#039;t believe that having a lot of negative karma is inherently bad (sometimes just that you voice your opinions a lot), but it gives me some satisfaction.<br /><br />Edit: Haha, and now from +2/-0 to +2/-2.
