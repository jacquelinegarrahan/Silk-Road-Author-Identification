				do they have a higher susceptibility to detect more common drugs:<br /><br />like cocaine/marijuana/heroin?<br /><br />as opposed to <br /><br />mdma/meth/lsd etc?<br /><br />thinking about bringing a small quantity with me on my travels.<br />never have seen a dog at the tsa security scanners (ever) , its just when you get past it gets tricky maybe.<br /><br />also, if you put in capsules, with other vitamins on carry-on should be okay right?<br /><br />swim, did this with mdma once, and no worries.

				MDMA is, I&#039;m lead to believe, far easier for a drug-dog to detect than weed. And weed is easy to detect, without vac-sealed bags. Whereas MDMA is easy to detect, even with them.

				Cut the swim shit out its retarded and especially unnecessary on a TOR based forum.<br /><br /><br />LSD is active in micrograms. If you have it on blotter paper the amount is so low that yes it is impossible for any dog to detect it. As far as MDMA goes I believe the above poster is wrong since marijuana has such a strong potent smell even humans can&#039;t help but notice it. I could be wrong but I think its pretty unlikely.

				true okay. <br /><br />would think putting in caps and in vitamin bottle would be handy, right?<br /><br />i highly doubt meth/mdma/lsd is caught on as easily as weed<br /><br />especially at small airports, im sure that the dogs are just trained to find bombs? right?

				Detection dogs can be trained to sniff out all sorts of things. Why would you take the gamble that only bomb sniffers are going to be at the airport? Why not just take a leaf out of the SR book and mail it to wherever you&#039;re traveling? Unless you&#039;re going through multiple countries on a day to day basis or something.

				have you guys ever dealt with this at airport security though?<br /><br />i have mixed maybe 20 different vitamins IN ONE single (vitamin) bottle before.<br />never got questioned.<br />i have also put random vitamins in my computer case, never questioned, never asked.<br /><br />i&#039;m just overthinking it i believe, especially if its &lt;1g under of meth, no worries i would believe?
