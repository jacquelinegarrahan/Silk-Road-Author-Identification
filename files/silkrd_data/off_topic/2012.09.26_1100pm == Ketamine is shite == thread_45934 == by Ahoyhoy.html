				My first K experience was actually very unexpected and thus my general opinion about it is quite bad. We got some powder from this guy at a new place in England I hadn&#039;t been before. Well so we got it, thinkinh it was MDMA. We all snorted some fat lines before leaving the apartment to go out clubbing (fortunately the club was near and the queue was minimal as we arrived early) but when I got inside shit hit the fan. My legs got all wobbly and numb and I felt very very weird, a sort of third person view was taking over me for the next 30 minutes and I couldn&#039;t dance at all, had to go outside in the smoking area and sit down. My friends were also very puzzled but insisted it was MDMA. Day after they confirmed it was ket, this was also my first ket trip so you can imagine how weird it must&#039;ve felt for me haha

				I don&#039;t take Ketamine to party, that&#039;s just silly in my opinion unless of course it&#039;s on the comedown of some molly. ;D I take Ketamine to lay down on my bed, listen to music, and fly to Mars. Combined with some strong weed and psychedelic playlists you can visit some very bizarre landscapes in your mind, the drip tastes a shit load worse than MXE though. I want to get into IM&#039;ing Ket but have no clue where to begin or what size needle to use or anything.<br /><br />A few mates of mine have had bad experiences with it because they aren&#039;t as in the know about drugs as myself and mistakenly took it at raves and clubs their first times as well.. idiots. ::) Anyways, I&#039;ve come to greatly enjoy the drug. :))

				Mmm I love ketamine it is one of my favorite drugs. People seem to either love or hate dissociatives. I happen to love them :D. Who doesn&#039;t want to look at themselves in third person and control their body like a Sim in the Sims? Who doesn&#039;t want to go on magical alien spaceship adventures with Super Jesus on a top secret mission from God?

				First time doing Special K, the breakfast cereal of champions, I ended up on the floor of the laundry room of the dorm I was in and was confused about the purpose of my feet. What were they there for? Did I really need them? How hard would it be to take them off? Finally someone came and showed me what they were for. Shortly thereafter, I did another bump, discovered what I call &quot;Flicker Time&quot; (it seems like life is passing by in a series of frames played in rapid succession) and visited with my friends, the Shadow People. Then they put me in a magic box that no matter what I did to get out, there was still more box. Later found out that was a k-hole. Pretty heavy stuff.<br />I&#039;ve mixed it with pretty much everything. Coke, Crystal, MDMA, MDA, LSD, Weed &amp; GHB. K is the drug of choice for the after, after party. You know, the one that starts Sunday morning and only those that started on Friday (or perhaps Thursday) night attend. It&#039;s utter mayhem and a complete gong show, and you&#039;re there all partied out from the weekend, in a K-omatose state. The weirdest shit happens. I love it mixed with weed, takes me to my own special place that I cal stupidsville, because I become an absolute moron that can&#039;t complete a coherent thought. Great way to come down, IMO. Doesn&#039;t mix well with GHB. A horse tranquilizer and a central nervous system depressant don&#039;t mix well together? Who knew? <br /><br />MJMuse

There won&#039;t be a fourth. <br />Please someone answer me this one fucking question......why ketamine?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />blasphemy!!!<br /><br />haha, but seriously, i would never take ketamine at a party now that i&#039;m not a dumbass college kid anymore.&nbsp; take it when you&#039;re at home with a bed to lay on and a stereo to listen to.&nbsp; its awesome.&nbsp; and if you combine it with MDMA its fuckin mental, guy.&nbsp; you either got some shitty ass K, or you didn&#039;t do it right.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />It#s because there&#039;s a possibility of bad batches that I gave it three goes. I have mates who rave about special K so it kept me intrigued. The last time I bought it was off a SR vendor with good feedback so I knew for sure that it was good shit. I took it and had a rubbish trip. I got high, for sure, but IT SIMPLY WASN&#039;T FUN. I take drugs to add something interesting to my life, to enhance the pleasure and supplement my body chemistry in interesting and revelatory ways. Acid does that, MDMA does that, coke does that and weed does that. Ket doesn&#039;t. Anyway, I can get the ket effect in&nbsp; other ways that don&#039;t involve drugs, ie....<br /><br />1. Get someone to spin me round 100 time before hitting me on the head with a frying pan.<br />2. Deprive myself of sleep for 48 hours and get someone to ht me over the head with a frying pan.<br />3. Get someone to hang me upside down until all the blood rushes to my head and then hit me over the head with a frying pan.<br /><br />

Combined with some strong weed and psychedelic playlists you can visit some very bizarre landscapes in your mind, the drip tastes a shit load worse than MXE though.

I find it a lot more relaxing than other drugs and it&#039;s relatively safe when snorted. You could however very easily get into trouble IM&#039;ing it so thats one of those lines in the sand I draw to keep myself from getting myself into trouble with drugs in general. I&#039;m of the opinion that once you are ok with, or otherwise cross the line of using spikes you open yourself up to some much more dangerous or risky behavior/substances.<br /><br />As always YMMV and dissociatives aren&#039;t for everyone.

				Actually it&#039;s not a horse tranquilizer;it&#039;s an anesthetic,a safe anesthetic relatively.Why do people love ketamine...?I think it&#039;s close related to s&amp;m :)&nbsp; &nbsp;
