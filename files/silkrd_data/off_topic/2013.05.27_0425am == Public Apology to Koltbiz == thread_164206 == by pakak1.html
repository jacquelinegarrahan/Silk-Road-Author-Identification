				A few months ago i accused the vendor Koltbiz for being a scammer - i have been following hes case since than and it seems that now he has proven himself as legit vendor -<br /><br />and i was the asshole to accuse him too quickly in scamming, even that he fully refunded me, i was a bit angry for ruining my stats of a new user.&nbsp; &nbsp;for this i apologize now publicly, you that called me an idiot back than - i guess you were right, i accept all blame and shame,&nbsp; &nbsp;i will not be so quick to judge again!<br /><br />* i will also delete all the posts were i have made the accusations.<br />* feel free to hit me with negative karma or whatever...

				Hey buddy good on ya mate for having the guts to admit you were wrong and do the right thing and clear the air and apologize. If anything you should get +1 karma for not letting your ego get in the way of facts. +1 from me buds.

				Thanks mate,&nbsp; when im wrong im wrong :)&nbsp; &nbsp;i told him from the beginning that if i will be wrong i will come back and apologize (and of course deleted all the posts i had with him calling him scammer)<br /><br />and you know what&nbsp; -&nbsp; im happy to be wrong, cause this guy been proving hes honesty for months and worked hard to get hes operation going,&nbsp; such vendors are valuable to SR&nbsp; - RESPECT.<br /><br />and people like me should know better and keep their mouth shut, i have never accused anyone and i guess i should not have accused him as well,&nbsp; im glad that we are all good now (as he also forgive me in hes thread)<br /><br />:)
