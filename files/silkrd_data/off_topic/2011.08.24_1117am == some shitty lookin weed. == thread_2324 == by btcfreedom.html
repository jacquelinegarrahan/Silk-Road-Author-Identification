				Mids? That passes for mids. Wow. Okay then. Mids are supposed to be tolerable. Dro the best. Regs/swag sucks. For a long time now people have been calling regs, mids. Unacceptable practice. I am glad I found SR. I sell too but variety is the spice of life. I want to try others peoples products. Ya just have to be careful. Glad there is a picture. And all the weed prices are astronomical. <br />MARIJUANA SHOULD BE FREE
