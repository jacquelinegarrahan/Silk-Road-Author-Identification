				I&#039;m considering meeting a guy off Grasscity that lives in my area. Now, the big question obviously is if he&#039;s a LEO or not. He &quot;seems&quot; legit as he&#039;s been posting a while there and posts like weekly pictures of his pickups, but I&#039;m a little leery. More leery that actually buying off here from the first time, lol! <br /><br />He said he might be able to help me out, but wanted to &quot;meet and match&quot; first though. I think I&#039;ve got the meet and match part down. I&#039;ll show you mine, you show me yours sort of thing... but are there certain screeners I should throw at him that could tell me if I&#039;m about to walk into an undercover setup?<br /><br />tb86

				theblackstallion86, I have done this before and here is what I did. Remember, this is VERY dangerous!<br /><br />#1) I gave him a fake name. No need to give out your real info.<br />#2) I chose the location, a restaurant at lunchtime. Lots of people around and a generally safe environment. One without any cameras in the parking lot.<br />#3) Take only a little. A small joint in a pack of smokes. If you are going to do a deal it is best to get to know him/her first and do the deal a little later.<br />#4) Get there 45min early. It was in a shopping center so I went around and checked out a couple of stores and wandered for about 15min casing the place.<br />#5) Go into the restaurant 30min early and choose a seat near a window so you can watch the parking lot and see people coming in and out.<br />#6) Order a drink and tell them you are waiting on some one. <br /><br />Watch how s/he arrives, what they are wearing, do they have anyone with them, are they the kind of person you expected, etc. If anything looks even the slightest bit out of place, simply pay for the drink and leave. If they walk up and ask if you are XXX you can simply smile and say no.<br /><br />The best advice is dont do it! It is a major risk.<br />

				Well, it sounds like he would be doing the selling so wouldn&#039;t that make him the dealer rather than you? Most police I&#039;ve come into contact with aren&#039;t really to concerned with the end user rather than the supplier. This would have to be a pretty shitty sting op to bust someone who might smoke weed on occasion. :/<br /><br />-Cheers
