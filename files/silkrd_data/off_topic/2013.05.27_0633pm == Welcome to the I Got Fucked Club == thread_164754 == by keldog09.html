				Some others and I recently lost some cash dealing with a scammer. The decision was bad and I feel bad. I&#039;ve been on the Road for a while now and got out of touch with the usual scamming tactics (particularly fake feedback). Let this be a lesson to everyone: when you think you know the game, you probably don&#039;t.<br /><br />I can understand why you wouldn&#039;t want to donate. I welcome all insults and criticism. Please send BTC to 1Lhh3cPdR8zcBEBpMUCHVS7NpwZ8aREyY7. <br /><br />I believe in the power of this community. Despite the money I&#039;ve lost on SR, I&#039;ve gained so much. I became interested in online markets after some rough encounters between me and a former h dealer (got thrown out of a moving vehicle, friend of mine got stabbed). This was two years ago and, thankfully, I haven&#039;t had to turn towards sketchy people and put myself in danger. Yes, this is all still illegal and yes, I did lose money, but I still have my life and my health.<br /><br />Once again, please donate or just send some Internet hugs. Any amount is fine. Love you all!

				I&#039;ve been fucked before. I believed the fake feedback the vendor left for themselves with a shill account, it could have been avoided if there was some kind of feedback verification system in place, like nearly every other onion black market...<br />

				well, I just posted to this thread&nbsp; &quot;Greendaddy888 you are a huge faggot and so are your customers&quot; and it started with Fake Feedback.&nbsp; I&#039;m now in resolution with this vendor and I&#039;m so tired of posting about.&nbsp; I guess if I don&#039;t post, then I&#039;m allowing a scammer to get away with it.

I&#039;ve been around for a while, and I&#039;ve been lucky so far. Some of that luck I made for myself, but some of it is indeed just dumb luck. There have been a couple tx&#039;s I made where just a couple weeks later the vendor went into full scam mode. e.g. tabmonster<br /><br /><br />(now that I opened my big mouth i&#039;m sure i have it coming :P )
