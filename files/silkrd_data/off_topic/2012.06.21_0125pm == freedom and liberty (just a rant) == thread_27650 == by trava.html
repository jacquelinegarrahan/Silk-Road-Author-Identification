				A popular sentiment on this forum is to &quot;get rid of government&quot; but I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s going to happen. People have banded together throughout history for mutual benefit. I believe that government is an offshoot of that urge. As far as types of government, democracy has all the others beat hands-down - your vote gives you a voice, however small. I would not want to live in North Korea, with its cult of personality and political prisons. Most of you will probably disagree with me, but it&#039;s what I believe.

				Name the last time there was complete freedom and liberty? It&#039;s been the same story for the past 5,000 years. At least we&#039;re not completely invading countries and wiping out entire clans/cultures.

But I&#039;m not sure I follow that second point<br /><br />MockFrog<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok, Ill explain the second part.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like the mayor of your town or the policies he is pushing, how hard is it to vote him out? Easy, you can contact and network enough like minded people that there is a possibility you can vote him out or have your voice heard in the democratic process. If not, you can move to a place that is more inline with what you believe.<br /><br />Take it up to the state level, the state governor or congress is pushing something that the people of the state don&#039;t like. Harder to get them out but if they upset enough, change happens and they get voted out. If not, you can move to a place that is more inline with what you believe.<br /><br />Take that up to the federal level, it is almost impossible to get enough people pissed enough to vote all of them out of office and effect real change. To top it off, there are a lot of difficulties in changing the country you live in.<br /><br />The issue as I see it is that the system was originally set up to be a bottom up government. The bulk of the power was at the city, county, and state level with a weak federal government. By doing this, the voice of the people would be heard at a level that would effect the biggest change directly related to them. <br /><br />Cities, were governed at the state level where the state oversaw that the individual rights were not trampled and the cities could be held responsible for the actions they took.<br /><br />The federal level had limited control over the states. It is too far removed from the people and too slow to change for the peoples direct vote to matter. Thus, the electoral colleges arranged by the state to elect the president. <br /><br />However, the founding fathers saw a minor issue here. If both houses are representing the states then the states could vote themselves more power, so it was divided.&nbsp; Each state received 2 senators and the house was to represent the people with each state receiving the number of house members based on the number of people in the state. <br /><br />Unfortunately it has been usurp in 1911 they passed a law locking the size of the house to no more than 435 members which defeats it&#039;s original purpose. Then senators were changed from state assigned to popular vote which degraded the function of the senate as a check on federal power. This opened the door for stronger and stronger federal law&#039;s as the states and citizens had less control.<br /><br />Thus, something like the controlled substances act could be passed taking the control that was reserved to the states and to the people respectively and transferring it to the federal government. In the 1930&#039;s state laws governed these things, in 1937 the predecessor to the controlled substances act was a tax law that taxed Marijuana at the grower, distributor, seller and buyer level, and it made it virtually impossible to get.<br /><br />Now, if the house of representatives was returned to the original standing with representatives for every 40,000 citizens in the state, how do you think the government would change? Currently with the lock on the number in place it is one member of the house for every 700,000 citizens and it grows every year, diluting our voice even more.

				When we are out hiking and we see a snake, our initial reaction is fear of the snake and urge to flee. When actually, that snake is probably more scared of us than we are of it.<br /><br />The same holds true for government. We are so quick to cower in fear of our &quot;big bully&quot; government, when actually, government should be just as scared of it&#039;s people as it&#039;s people are of government.<br /><br />This is why I think groups like Occupy Wall Street are SO important in calling out government BS and simply having a presence, a force that says, &quot;If you fuck with us, we will fuck back!&quot;
