				Yep , the only way to perform a 51% attack on btc is buy buying 51 % of them - but a lot of alt crypto currencies are susceptable to them .

				well as far as I understood it , and I&#039;ve only just started studying the subject - the 51 % attack can only be performed by someone who controls 51% of the currency allowing&nbsp; &nbsp;someone to double spend transactions .<br /><br />It looks like I have some more reading to do Hoff !<br /><br />

				Ah ok , so it&#039;s just hashing power , not the actual ownership of the coins .<br /><br />There are other manipulations you can perform by owning 51 % of C.C&nbsp; no ? - I&#039;m could have sworn I read there were - could be wrong though <br /><br />Thanks for setting me straight btw , you got me reading again - it&#039;s going to be a long night !

				A funny thing is, this COULD happen with bitcoins IF the US government or another powerful government wanted to do it.&nbsp; They have the money and power to have powerful ASICs built and have a nice farm of them.&nbsp; Whether or not they would ever spend all the money on a project like that is the question.

				hahaha this made me laugh. How ecstatic do you reckon the guy was when he cleared the 40,000 coins and had them in a wallet, I bet he was over the fucking moon. <br />doubt he will sell them. I bet he will just cash them out and make some major fucking cash. Most cyber crimes dont get reported anyway as the government does not want everybody learning how to do it and making it easy to steal, the average amount stolen each time is 1.3 million as well, compare that with in-bank robberies and the difference is phenomenal.
