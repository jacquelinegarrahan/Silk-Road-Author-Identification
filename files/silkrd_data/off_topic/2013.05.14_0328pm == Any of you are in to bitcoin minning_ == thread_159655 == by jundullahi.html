				Any of you are in to bitcoin minning?<br /><br />If you how is it working out for you. <br />And do you thing the recent BTC price drop is in any way related to the shipping of the newButterfly bitcoin minning units?

				The price drop was the BTC/$240+ bubble popping. It was an outrageous price not actually reflecting BTC&#039;s true value. What triggered the collapse was MtGox getting DDoSed.

				Oke but that was like more then a month ago. <br />I mean the more recent one first it was like 150 dollar then dropped to 90 now stabilized on 115.<br />And the butterfly units started shipping end of April.

				I am not sure but don&#039;t think it&#039;s the reason. Anyhow, if you plan to start mining, you&#039;ll need an ASIC. GPUs are out of the question unless as a hobby or if you get free electricity, and even then the profit will be marginal.

				Yeah I tried it with my HD7850 but I would be make like 0.0017 BTC. Deferentially not worth. And would have my PC running day and night and its in the same room where I sleep. So that out of the question.<br />I did order ASIC units but still waiting. I hopefully get it in August.&nbsp;

				When did you order. Maybe I was a better idea to sell you pre order on ebay.<br />I have seen some pre order go for as much as 800 dollar. Almost 3 times the original price.<br />But now the have a police of all sales are final. So I cannot get my money back just have to wait.<br />ASIC still would be better then GPU. So even if the Difficulty goes crazy. Hopefully still will be making some money.

				I ordered some Singles, not Jalapenos, they were around $1.2K at the time. Ordered at the end of 2012. After they passed deadline after deadline, and no updates or reports for too long, I started suspecting they will never actually ship and requested a refund.
