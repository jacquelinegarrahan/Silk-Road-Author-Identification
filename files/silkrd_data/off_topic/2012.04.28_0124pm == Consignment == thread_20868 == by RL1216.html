				Best of luck to you! You will need it with only two posts and asking something like this.<br /><br />Did you think this post out thoroughly? It just seems like a no brainer that people aren&#039;t going to respond or give you hell maybe call you LE.<br /><br />Seriously, just get BTC&#039;s and buy your product. Not trying to give you a hard time, but you asking about this is just absurd when you put an ounce of logic into it.

				If you need a job then selling drugs isn&#039;t going to fix anything trust me. Selling drugs is something that takes a certain person to do it successfully and they are far and few between, although a lot of people attempt and pose as drug dealers they usually get caught, or don&#039;t make any amount of money to actual substantially live on.<br /><br />Successful drug dealers are about 1 in 1000 who take up the task, and then their time doing it without getting caught up is limited to a few years at most usually without getting a case.<br /><br />I have sold a lot of drugs and have a good friend who has been doing it for years he also has a current case pending and makes enough to pay rent, take care of his house, maintain his image a little, but doesn&#039;t have 50k extra stashed around in hidden places in his house he might have a few thousand always accessible, but when you count how much needs to be re invested and how much to maintain it really isn&#039;t much profit at all for all the risk. It seems that way at first glance though.<br /><br />I only met one person who made actual money and you couldn&#039;t tell he was a dealer at all. He had multiple vehicles and was quite and reserved, but oversaw a multi kilo distribution operation in a hub city, but still worked all day as a landscaper, because he couldn&#039;t stand not working.
