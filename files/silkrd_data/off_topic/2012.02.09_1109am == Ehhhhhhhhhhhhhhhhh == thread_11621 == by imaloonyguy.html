				Well, i think i fully understand the &quot;too good to be true&quot; statement. i think this site is a set up. i mean i found this on google. i, like an idiot got excited and got my BTC, got it&nbsp; transferred here, then there and bought from a &quot;vendor&quot;. i just told the vendor to cancel the order, and if he is willing to return my BTC, else keep them and still cancel my order. i may try and keep my BTC and try and trade them back for a little of my money back. here i am shaking in my boots for a &quot;shipment of the finest quality product&quot; completely anonymous. yea right, tor, btc and silk road are all together. tor is used for nothing else, btc are not used for anything else. all the feedback is just fake looking, &quot;the best! oh man sweeeeeeeet&quot; where do you even leave feedback anyways. i hope anyone that hasnt bought anything sees this and realizes it is not work the risk, whether it works or not. i think im already in quick sand, but man im a dumb person. good luck to you all.................

				Lay off the weed, man. You&#039;re getting paranoid.<br /><br />As it happens, Tor and bitcoins are used for plenty else. And the Silk Road is real. Is it too good to be true? Not really. If you get caught buying weed IRL, you&#039;re charged with possession. If you get caught buying weed here, you might get charged with conspiracy, drug trafficking (possibly international drug trafficking) and facilitation of terrorist activities. Prices here are also higher, and there&#039;s a very real risk of getting scammed if you don&#039;t use due diligence in selecting whom to buy from.<br /><br />Your hastily drawn conclusions are sadly untrue.

				where else is TOR used??? the underground web is like 10x the size of the surface web - whatever you see in google basically. so think about that. and TOR has access to all of that. with that said, BTCs can be traded with any site who accepts them. and it&#039;s more and more each day. <br /><br />I&#039;m new here, and I have already had a few successful purchases. this place is &quot;too good to be true&quot; for people who can&#039;t handle the RISK that comes with this site. if you can&#039;t handle the consequences, then you shouldn&#039;t be here. same thing in real life - if you can&#039;t handle the pressure of a shady deal - you shouldn&#039;t be making a deal. from the sound of it, you can&#039;t handle it. <br /><br />now, I think it may be past your bedtime, and you may have also missed a dose of your meds. you should prolly let your mommy know where you&#039;ve been all night

				Out of all the deepweb drug sites, this is the cream of the crop.<br />You could try BMR http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php but don&#039;t expect there to be any fewer scams.<br />Read the SR Wiki http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br />Research the vendors you wish to buy from here at the forums.<br />Buy.<br />Wait up to two weeks.<br />Enjoy your ill gotten gains.<br />&nbsp;8)

				i guess i got very very pumped in the possibilities of this network. sooo pumped that i invested money into btc ect... then later that night i toke a bowl. deep paranoia hits me where im littery a puss in boots. that paranoia was false, but i realized is it really worth it? i sold my btc and &quot;perky&quot; robbed me, and i guess it is all fair game. but BTC Buddy was very nice in following through and purchasing the coins. there are good and bad here, and i dont find any substance worth weeding through to find the right people. no good can come out of this...
