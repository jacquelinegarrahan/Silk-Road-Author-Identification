				Alright so I was looking for a rubberband in some drawers, and I came across a sandwich bag with a big tinfoil ball in it. I opened it up, in the tin foil ball was a lot of thin light colored small seeds, mixed into it were some ice looking clear/white things that when I looked up look a lot like crystal meth ( http://www.ineedcoffee.com/08/coffee-meth/images/meth_crystals.jpg ) exactly like that. and then there was a smaller bag with what looks like tiny yellow rocks covered in a white powder. I took a sniff of the bag and I got light headed.<br /><br />Can someone please give me any information they can infer about what I found?<br />

But yeah, you may have found your dad&#039;s stash. Hardcore though? What does that mean? <br /><br />I guess for some people finding out their parents take drugs is akin to the grim realisation that over 50&#039;s have sex&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Just a thought though, is your dad a keen gardener? The seeds/ crystals might be something as harmless as some expensive plant seeds mixed with some desiccant to stop them rotting...<br /><br />

				the seeds i cant explain but the yellow rocks with white powder is heroin and the ice stuff is meth and the seeds could be something to keep the ice dry after ur dad acetone washed them and was the foil burned at all?

				If your going to steal his stash, which I wouldn&#039;t advise, at least leave him a couple of hits otherwise he will be really pissed off when he finds that his relaxing bath salts are gone.<br /><br />My dad didn&#039;t mind me robbing a bit of his weed as long as I left him a decent bit.
