				So i&#039;ve been incredibly preoccupied and havent been able to get on for more than 5 minutes the past week- but I haven&#039;t seen any posts on the Miami Zombie incident- I figured I&#039;d come back and see a post or something on it- maybe I missed it as I have only been skimming thru the forum so far.&nbsp; But what do you guys think about the situation and what do you think he was on- I&#039;ve heard LSD and Bath Salts which later someone said was MDPV.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard the LSD one debunked thank the lord.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve done the bath salts before and I always kinda wondered what they were- I always assumed a md varient- MDPV made sense.&nbsp; But damn to act like that is wild.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I dont know if anyone heard about the MMA Fighter in Cali who took mushroom tea and thought his buddy was the devil so he ripped out his heart while he was still living.<br /><br />Honestly I find that a lot of stories have been popping up around hallucinogens oddly around the same time and it seems fishy, but I mean shits getting wild man.&nbsp; Figured Id start a thread to get your guys 2 cents.&nbsp; Clearly the dudes had some issues prior too and the Miami guy seemed to take too much and not stay hydrated, but please do comment would love to hear you guys&#039; feedback

				It&#039;s definitely the T virus, no other explanation. There was an article I saw earlier today where they interviewed the dudes girlfriend, she insisted that her man was in fact not a zombie, but that is exactly what I would expect a zombie-sympathizer to say.

				It&#039;s clearly either PCP or, just as worse, the fucking nasty RC known as &quot;bath salts.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve also seen X-pills around me that had been cut with the shit. If anyone is selling that shit as E or whatever, be sure to put your fist into their face. <br /><br />This dude was clearly mentally unstable though too. <br /><br />Having done GOOD LSD a few times now, I can safely say that LSD did NOT cause this to happen; that&#039;d be a different story if he did like a thumbprint or something lol.<br /><br />Definitely has NOTHING to do with LSD though.

				I am really not happy with the stress that the media is putting on the possiblity of it being bath salts. Reminds me of the case in the UK that caused a media firestorm that got meow banned but in the end it turned out they had not consumed any Mephedrone and that it was just an OD from alchohol. <br /><br />Some UM doctor was taking about bath salts and how they are coming out of China. <br /><br />In Florida most popular forms of bath salts have been illegal for a while. Whatever, he took it definitely was not legal in florida because all of the most powerful cathinones have been banned since right before Spring Break 2011. <br /><br />I just don&#039;t understand, how come people keep saying &quot;He took a legal bath salt&quot; when bath salts are illegal in Florida. Its like people completely forgot about the 2011 law. <br /><br />Everyone is making ridiculous claims about what it was but no one really has a god damn clue. The interview with the family made it seem like there was something seriously crazy going on in his life and none of it makes sense. They were like, &quot;He doesn&#039;t even take tylenol.&quot; Typical Miami bullshit.

Fuck, even Dahmer didn&#039;t make dog noises when he ate people&#039;s faces. He was on a substance and it was one of the PCP-esque drugs. <br /><br />You ever seen rabid people on PCP? Watch COPS. There have been multiple suspects (all black), who had the urge to rip off their clothes, as well as imitating animal-like behavior and sounds.<br /><br />What about the guy on bath salts who dangled himself over a bridge last year. He was so out of it, he took off all his clothes and couldn&#039;t even speak words.<br /><br />See the connections? It&#039;s nice to be reserved, but lets all be real here. Bad drugs played a BIG role in this.

				Nah you can still get bath salts quite easily in fla- most convenience stores in urban areas of fla sell like &quot;Molly&#039;s Love&quot; Toliet Sanitizer along with about 20 other variations of it-&nbsp; I was thinking PCP- the blunts I&#039;ve smoked with hoodrats down there half the time are sherm-&nbsp; I dont like the media attention at all because its pretty much all speculation- and its just bugging out regular society- my mom has called me several times worried im going to be gnawing peoples faces off when I go out or what not- its ridculous

I hate how the media take one occurrence and slap it everywhere and literally turning it into a massive &#039;bath salt&#039; epidemic. Giving them a bad name and everyone who takes them a bad name. I pretty much blame the media for everything. If they didn&#039;t take some much time into telling everyone how bad drugs where instead of teaching people to respect them and use them how they&#039;re meant to be used then we wouldn&#039;t have such a drug &#039;problem&#039;. E.g Mephedrone was banned in the UK because of all the untrue tabloid bullshit and as soon as it was demand for the drug sky rocket as soon as it was illegal, with people taking it willy-nilly without any sense or dosage instructions. The same will happen with the &#039;bath slat&#039; that this zombie dude took. even though it wasn&#039;t probably entirely to blame as he probably had a mental disorder or illness that encouraged it. but yeah basically fuck the media

They used to be all the rage but the cracked down pretty hard and banned a huge list of the best cathinones. <br /><br />The likeliehood of this being a legal bath salt is very very slim.<br /><br />His family said that the only thing he ever did was pot and that he wouldn&#039;t even take a tylenol. My boy got dosed with sherm weed once and it is actually quite common with the shitty hood rats here. PCP is the only thing that would cause this. No way some weak ass legal cathinone would have caused this. MDPV is the only thing that could cause intense psychosis and even then it isn&#039;t likely to cause violent psychosis. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25116.msg267986#msg267986">Quote from: fsgr on June 01, 2012, 08:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What RC are &quot;bath salts&quot; actually?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its usually Flephedrone or some other similar cathinone.
