				Not a show. but a movie.&nbsp; Will probably only work if you are 40+ and can remember the original TV show...<br /><br />The first Brady Bunch Movie.<br /><br />The second one, they realised everyone who rented it a hundred times over was a stoner and they actually made the movie for stoners.&nbsp; To me that wasn&#039;t as effective as the first one, which was truly hysterical, mainly unintentionally.

				I got two. I generally tend to go for animated shows and while there are a lot of great ones to watch (My Little Pony, Adventure Time, Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends) but there are two that are just wonderful. One is the anime FLCL, which is one of the trippiest damn things ever even when sober and is also freaking hilarious. The other is a show called Clone High. There is an episodes about raisins (won&#039;t say any more then that) and it&#039;s probably the greatest thing I&#039;ve ever seen while high, bar-none. Hilarious.
