				We&#039;re getting ready for martial law.&nbsp; We have also been training the national guard in Minnesota, in the past week in fact.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t you seen the videos of them training in civilian neighborhoods guns drawn fully loaded?&nbsp; Shit is about to hit the fan for real, prepare or be left in the dust.

It&#039;s Urban Operations training. The US Military pays smaller towns to use them as Urban Training areas to increase soldiers awareness to the number of civilians around. It&#039;s been going on for YEARS. Like, longer than you&#039;ve been alive. And guess what, it&#039;s saved lives. When you train to assess a target BEFORE shooting at it, it helps to NOT shoot the little old lady walking around the corner while your on your patrol route. Trust me. This whole fucking uproar over training in US towns is retarded. <br /><br />Martial Law? Are you retarded? <br /><br />Don&#039;t answer that.

About 5 years ago some friends and I were coming back from a spring break trip, I&#039;ll leave the location unnamed for obvious reasons. Anyway, we had been smoking our fucking asses off and were high as shit and one of my friends had to use the restroom, said he was about to shit his pants. We pull off the highway and take this small country road to where we thought was simply back away from the highway so he could do his thing. We come over this hill about a mile off the highway and what the fuck do we run into..... What looked like an entire police force doing this exact same shit, hahahaha. They had a whole training setup out there, scaling walls, the dummy house, all that shit. <br /><br />Goddamn you talk about shitting fucking bricks!!!! We had bud and all kind of shit in the car. Was honestly surprised my friend did not shit himself right then and there.... Luckily they paid us little to no attention, but he did find another place to go shit. Still. Not the type of thing you want to run into when you are stoned off your fucking tits.

				You know, its really annoying when I post what I thought was an interesting link, some conspiracy nut comes out aswingin. And then a couple of douchebags try and &quot;reel him in&quot; by being mean. These forums have gotten shitty, maybe we should start charging for memberships. Somethingawful did it and it seems to do a good job of keeping out the riffraff.
