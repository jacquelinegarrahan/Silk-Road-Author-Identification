				Yes, I know this feeling.&nbsp; But in my case it&#039;s bitching about always being on the computer.&nbsp; She doesn&#039;t specifically know about Silk Road and I don&#039;t let her watch what I do on the computer

				hahahahah yes i got that a lot when i first jumped on. but then i just realized ways to <br />circumvent this problem. like knocking off a slice and putting her to sleep then i could do whatever <br />i want. or i just make sure that its in my downtime and when she&#039;s in the same room or not <br />busy i pay all of my attention to her! She def doesnt like the idea of it but she&#039;s ok with it.<br />as much as she will be anyway

				Trust me, it&#039;s a lot worst when your gf doesn&#039;t know what the hell you&#039;re always doing on the computer.&nbsp; She always assumes Im talking to other girls or something because of all the typing on the forums so I usually just wait until she passes out to get on the road...or when she&#039;s not around like now :)

				Yea, my girl is a nympho and horny just about 24-7 and I don&#039;t have near as much sex drive as she does. I also have a major computer addiction that has been going strong over 20 years. I spend all day on the computer while she is at work and when she gets in she is getting naked and trying to pull me away from the computer wanting to cuddle and fuck all night. I know this seems like an odd thing to complain about but I love my drugs and computers, I also love her, she understands how addicted I am and is getting more lenient giving me my time on the computer and I like surprising her by getting off the computer to spend time with her when she isn&#039;t expecting it, so I&#039;m trying my best now to balance the girl/computer ratio.

				I can&#039;t fucking believe my eyes. All of you have girlfriends?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />A lot of people ask me, &#039;Kenny Powders, you&#039;re a giant star. You can get any woman. Have you ever paid for sex?&#039; And the answer is yes, I have. And it&#039;s actually kinda cool. You can negotiate practically anything and sometimes, even just kind of do stuff in the moment that you never agreed to pay for and it goes by without much argument.

There are two questions you must ask yourself before you proceed. <br />1. Is your current girlfriend disposable? <br />Most females are extremely jealous in nature, and just because it was her idea won&#039;t stop her from throwing the incident up in your face at 3:30 in the goddamn morning when she starts a fight about something else and you&#039;re only trying to go sleep. These kind of things can be quite taxing on a relationship. <br />2. Have you ever done it before?<br />WWM threesomes can be very enjoyable, if everyone involved is confident, secure, and knows what they are doing. If this is not the case, it can turn into an fumbling cesspool overflowing with jealousy, hurt feelings, and in some extreme cases grievous harm done to someone&#039;s genitalia. However, if you have not done it before, male bragging rights laws and regulations imposed in 1954 clearly state that you must, as soon as the opportunity presents itself--as long as the two females in question are at least a passable &#039;7&#039;. <br />Source: *CLEARNET WARNING* http://tinyurl.com/n3ejhjy<br /><br />So, if your girlfriend is attractive, and the other female is attractive, and you haven&#039;t done it, the default answer is yes.<br />However, if you have done it, and you do not consider your girlfriend disposable, it is up to you. I will advise, though, that girls with ravenous sexual appetites usually (not always) have some other issues too, and the possibility of her getting jealous is very high. Nymphomaniacs are exhausting long term as well, so that&#039;s something to consider. If you have other obligations and she feels like you are not paying enough attention to her, it won&#039;t be long before you find out that she&#039;s running off to do impromptu gloryhole work or some other such nonsense. Better to leave on your high note, I&#039;d say.<br /><br />As far as the original tread topic, no, she does not. My wife knows what I do and understands that I have to work to keep her car paid, the electricity on, and so she can buy those ridiculous scented soaps from that bath place in the mall that gives me a headache every time I walk by it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
