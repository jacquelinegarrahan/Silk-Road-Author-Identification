				Is it possible to get a Fake ID and some form of credit history to go with it? What about fake bank statements and a SSN? How difficult is all of this to get? Im not trying to get a passport or anything. Just maybe trying to open a bank account under a different name.<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				Ok, so here is how IDs work. All the info on them is scannable and readable if you have the right equipment. When you buy a fake they just put whatever you want on em because while most people have the tech to read it, they don&#039;t have the tech to check it against the main ID database. I.E bars, etc. <br /><br />What you want is a little harder to do. You need to create a fake id using someone else&#039;s REAL data which is much harder and much more expensive and carries a greater risk as time goes on. <br /><br />I recall seeing someone in the UK selling identities, but I have no idea how legit that is and it is VERY costly.&nbsp;

				If you are a newbie you probably don&#039;t want to mess with the banks since they have all the money, all the control, and they don&#039;t like being screwed around.

				In case you&#039;re thinking of applying for a fake SS# with a dead baby&#039;s info, you do realize that all credit reports now have a pretty reliable check for that.&nbsp; Building a fake credit history with a fake SS# to defraud a bank (not that they shouldn&#039;t have to drink their own medicine considering the scale of looting/defrauding they&#039;ve been doing), which is what you doing by opening up an account with fraudulent info, is pretty close to being on par with trying to get a passport.

				HackBB might be a better resource for you to find the information you&#039;re after.<br /><br />But I agree with what everyone said, unless you know EXACTLY what you&#039;re doing, and EXACTLY how to do it correctly you should steer clear entirely.
