				ok i need to get someone fired from their job.&nbsp; i am not going to get into why its a long story,, lets just say this is justified due to what he did to me and my family.. <br /><br />i have thought of things such as getting dozens of adult magazine subscriptions sent to his job site in his name and having people call his supervisor and saying this person owes money and shit like that<br /><br />any other ideas ?

				I doubt the adult magazine thing would work, nobody in their right mind would get porn shipped to their workplace so it&#039;d be pretty obvious someone was screwing with him. <br /><br />If you really want proper advice though you&#039;ll probably have to explain what he did.

				If he really did mess with you and your family, he sounds like a bad dude. But consider HIS family, and the implications getting him fired would have on them. They are innocent in all this, and him losing his job would affect those around him permanently. If he did something illegal to you and your family, consider legal avenues to punish him such as criminal complaints or a good old civil filing. A lawsuit may indeed be the best thing to do to him because it will drain his bank account and time defending it. <br /><br />That being said, if you really want him fired, we should know at least what country you are in so that we may identify applicable laws and use them against him. In the US, complaints against an employee for sexual harassment, racism and discrimination are the easiest way to get someone fired. Even sending an anonymous letter to his boss, or even addressed to all employees, about his involvement in a child sexual abuse or female sexual harassment incident will get him into hot water. If nobody comes forward to substantiate it he may well keep his job, but his reputation at the office will be permanently ruined. <br /><br />My advice is to take a couple weeks to cool off and let your temper subside. Think rationally about the damage he did to your family. Instead of focusing on revenge, perhaps you should focus on healing your families wounds and building a stronger bond with them through this crisis.

				I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t feel comfortable being involved in this given I don&#039;t know the situation. Whatever he did to you, things have a way of working themselves out. His actions will come back to him somehow. Please just focus on being a good person yourself. Sounds like you have a family who you care about and that is a blessing in itself. Keep your head up, man. Good luck to you and your family!

				Dudes like this take the biggest falls OP, I&#039;d try and move on with my life and not let Dickfeatures know he&#039;s affected you. His shit will fall apart and you can take satisfaction knowing it&#039;s deserved.<br />Instant revenge feels good, but it&#039;s hollow gratification. <br /><br />I really agree with Sname, take some time to cool off. You might find that you come up with a more cerebral method of extracting retribution and I&#039;m telling you Amigo, cold revenge is the tastiest!!!

				what you need to do is forgive. because in forgiveness is the secret to be happy and positive. when you forgive and let go of what has been done you lose that terrible mental weight of anger, revenge, hatred. instead your happiness and positiveness will increase. if you take revenge by harming his life, then you are no better than him because all you are trying to do is equal the score. forgive him , my friend and be free for we are all truly one.
