				I is most definitely going to get brutally murdered for this...&nbsp; XD<br />One of our guys (No namessss haha) has grabbed the car and gone out to do the morning package drop with TK. Recently he´s been a bit down in the dumpssss, not that anyone would notice, he´s always been a star at putting on a brave face. But his missus left a few weeks back, wanted to go back to shitty UK, dumb bitch, he´s a cutie and hes always got a bit of skirt chasing him. We all told him she was a wrong´un.. And he´s got some fam troubles back home, its coming up to the dates in which he got out of jail a few years back too, it always makes him think. He´s been trying to get back on the whole gym flex, getting fit I guess is his way of dealing with shizz. But we had some proper deep conversation on his personal opium stash yesterday. and it got me thinking&nbsp; ::) I ended up nodding hard. And he told me that he just can´t find the energy to get up and go to the gym anymore, like everything is 100% more effort than before... he said its like he just physically cant find the energy, not even to do the weights in our home gym anymore.. I dunno if hes depressed or not.. I dont even know if hes capable of getting depressed lol.. He´s a strong guy, its not like hes wasting away.. But if it helps him feel better I want him to do it. We care about him loads, truthfully I dont think we will ever meet someone like him again. He´s really a unique cookie. His friends can´t seem to pick him up, I can´t pick him up and I´m his bessie, So maybe if any of you GYM goers have any advice for him.. He values you guys a lot, I think finding intelligent customers with the ability to think changed his view on the game.. You should have seen some of the old guys we dealt to on the streets back in UK lol, proper reprobates..<br /><br />THE FOXYESTTTT ROXXXXXXXXXX

				I would say that just because someone puts on a brave face doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re not depressed. I too am like that. I try to never show any work colleagues or friends that I&#039;m depressed. When my mother died, I was at work that same week making jokes and going on as if nothing had happened. But then I went home and cried my heart out. And in all honesty, I really wish I could express my emotions and get people to understand when I&#039;m sad. Many people won&#039;t be supportive when they see you going on as if you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />So it&#039;s a really good thing that this guy has friends who can be supportive and who can understand that he must be going through hell at the moment.

				It&#039;s the girl thing, ace. No matter HOW MUCH he says it has nothing to do with that, I guarantee you that even if he THOUGHT she was the &quot;one&quot;, only friends like you and time can mend a wound that words can&#039;t describe. He would tell ya about it if he knew how. Been there :-/ THOUGHT she was the &quot;one&quot;. God was I definitively wrong. I couldn&#039;t have been more incorrect looking back lol. If he&#039;s the type that if left alone would be just fine (before all this) make an EXTRA effort to go get his ass out of the house to do WHATEVER. He doesn&#039;t care what he&#039;s doing, or he wouldn&#039;t be sitting at the house bored, so at least choose something somewhat amusing haha. It&#039;s the conversation that you are going to have to PRY out of him when he&#039;s READY (there&#039;s no set time obviously). This is going to take more than one outing. Make him feel important as feel comfortable doing so. That&#039;s what he&#039;s lacking most likely. The need to be needed. It&#039;s a sick disease. Just keep in mind that his thought process right now is like a bad acid loop and he will have a TOUGH time getting out of that on his own. Hope this helps or what it&#039;s worth.

				I would imagine that he dosent eat correctly and is therefore run down by working out.<br /><br />Get him a professional diet plan done by a nutritionist.<br /><br />Also have a professional look over his workout plan and make sure he isnt overdoing some of the muscle groups.

				It&#039;s all got to do with the girl&nbsp; - trust me.<br /><br />Like the boy we are talking about, I was an avid gym goer - I was actually, a junior bodybuilding champion for the north of my country.<br /><br />It was like an obsession, and a lot of people said I was going places with it ( I had talked to sponsers, if I had won another competition I would have signed a $10&#039;000 (roughly) contract with a big names supplement company. Bear in mind I was only about 18 at this point.<br /><br />And I had a girlfriend, the most beautiful girl in the world - she was my everything, but I didn&#039;t really know that yet because it had seemed like I had just become an arrogant meat head, lol. <br /><br />Anyway, because the gym had taken over my life - I was never seeing&nbsp; her and we had kind of drifted apart. And she broke up with me.<br /><br />The day she broke up with me, to be honest, I didn&#039;t really care. But by day 3/4, it hit me and I was a mess.<br /><br />The gym meant nothing - I pulled out of the upcoming shows, and gave up that life. I stopped going to the gym, stopped eating like I should be, stopped everything that even reminded me of my previous life. <br /><br />And it took me a hell of a long time to get over her. But, eventually I realised what I wanted to do with my life as a career and got on track with that. I lost myself in my new work, which was ok because it&#039;s something I loved. And yes, I did start going to the gym again, but in a totally different way.<br /><br />I do it to maintain the muscle I have, and to keep fit, not to become a huge lump of muscle mass. <br /><br />Anyway, maybe a year went past since we had broken up, and I went out for a drink with my best friend. <br /><br />We were having a good time, and can you guess who had turned up at the pub? Yes, the ex. <br /><br />At first , it was just an awkward hello and awkward eye contact - so I went over a spoke to her, we had a good talked. Talked about before, and she said how glad she was that I had managed to change and all that, and then she left.<br /><br />And that alone made me realise how much I actually loved that girl, and that I couldn&#039;t let her just go. <br /><br />So, I left the bar to, to go to her flat, to tell her this. When I was about 10 minutes away, I got a text on my phone. <br /><br />&quot;I miss you, we really need to talk&quot;<br /><br />I told her I was already on my way over - we got back together, and have been for about 1.2 years now.<br /><br /><br />**With the whole gym thing, you just really need to tell your friend - do you want to go to the gym? If yes, get off your fucking ass and go, if no, don&#039;t fucking go.<br /><br />It&#039;s that simple really, if he likes being in good shape - he has to go! No one else can do this for him.<br /><br />Hope this helps him a little anyway.

				Can&#039;t compete with Slicksuit in terms of my [edit] level, but I was very committed until [edit] ago when I had to [edit], wasting hours of [edit] in the process.

You usually go through a slump early on, but you get over it and hit life harder than before. It&#039;s not unknown for guys to reassess, recharge, and come back stronger. Hope this is the case. Don&#039;t let him fade away to nothing though; it&#039;s not pleasant. Try St John&#039;s Wort (a natural antidepressant that isn&#039;t a drug), that will increase seratonin and dopamine levels. That in turn will entice him back to food as mood and appetite levels pick up (guys usually don&#039;t eat when depressed, girls often eat more). Tell him to stop taking whey powder, testosterone and creatine as they will make him angrier.

In fact right now its both of us, shes sat next to me vac packing orders and asking questions about posts. hopefully she will go and put a hot knife on for some opium lol.. hint... ::)<br />Rox says shell put in a freebie if you ever put an order in with us. <br />Thats the thing about not having to FE, if people dont abuse it its perfect, but when a vendor sees that people are taking the piss eventually everyone will have to FE... with great power comes great responsibility and all. lol.

When that stopped I stopped.&nbsp; I would disagree with Duckman on the cause though; it would seem to me it stemmed from the break-up and not from neglecting to eat enough, and that it has had spiral effect much like mine currently. <br /><br />Don&#039;t underestimate the power of &#039;rebound&#039; relationships.

Stuff has happened between us, it always does. But theres an understanding there. I want to be there for her always, and her for me. Its harder to do that if you are all inter-tangled in a relationship. I dont want things to get complicated, Im a very intense person and burn a bit too hot for most people to handle. Rox can just about take it but at a distance lol. Its why my relationships are short. Its like I live a lifetime with a person in a very short time. I dont come equipped with breaks. Id die for Rox, in fact theres never been a girlfriend or friend I have put before her, I could be on my honeymoon and one call from her would have me back home. All my ex gfs have been insanely jealous. some with reason lol. its a shame you cant see photos of us because of the need to stay anonymous and the fact that we are sellers, but she really is one of the prettiest people I know, in a kinda funky fairy raver way, imagine a dark short haired small punky tinkerbell and your on the right track.&nbsp; I dont believe in cheating on someone, but with Rox I dont really see it as cheating... We love each other in the truest sense of the word, and that is very different from having a partner. Neither I nor her gets jealous when the other has a partner because we know exactly who comes first.. In fact I really liked her ex, he was a pretty cool dude. But yeah, I if I find another gf Ill give myself to them, but they need to know that I am only loaned, my heart belongs elsewhere, thats hard for people to handle so sometimes its just mine and foxy roxs secret lol... I might go make some food and have some opium in a bit so she might come on line<br />ACE

				Wow. I couldn&#039;t have summed up the situation better, even if I KNEW the actual situation, and then tried to sum it up; you&#039;ve pretty well summed it up there quite well. Good writing skills. Sounds like you have one hell of a friendship there. I think I myself would have tried for the next step if I knew her and thought about her like that. I mean, ring her at your honeymoon? That&#039;s pretty deep. (And a little unfair for your current newlywed if you had one lol) But I also think if you two were going to try it, it probably should have been a long time ago. I don&#039;t think I could do that myself (too much of a lover&nbsp; :P&nbsp; :-*&nbsp; ::) :&nbsp; ) but good for you mate, I hope it works out. Just, don&#039;t regret it in 10 years when you&#039;re both too old to do it and think, hmmmm, I wonder what could have been? <br /><br />I&#039;m still on the forums as I&#039;m in bed (can&#039;t escape when you&#039;re lying down). So sleepy. But so entertaining! These threads are funny. I think DPR should put out a Superstars of SR thread and put me and you on it and our funny conversations. We deserve it.<br /><br />Take care buddy. I&#039;ll be here for the next 20 mintes. Piece out. Drive safely. (Whata man! You the mahn!! Playa!!!)
