				Dear Silk Road members!<br /><br />Great stuff going on here! Let me introduce myself, my name is Mitanox (actually its not, but you cant really blame me for that), 20-something years old and currently living in the second largest city in a European country. I found this site trough a article on wired.com, neat stuff! Ill not go to much into details about my personal life but I can tell a bit about my professional one:<br /><br />Im a dope dealer for 6 years. I used to sell pills and weed at parties, it became to risky dealing with so many people so right now I only sell big quantities once every month or so. I usually have half a kilo of pure MDMA laying around and several pages of LSD blotter with different designs (Alex Gray, Shiva, Hoffmans, Buddha&#039;s &amp; others) ranging in the 120 to 250 mics range. Im planning on becoming a seller at Silk Road to gain a bit of extra income and spread psychedelics in the meantime (yes, MDMA is also a psychedelic, despite what people say). I&#039;d say im 70% in the biz for the money and the other 30% im in for spreading the spiritual insight you will be able to get from psychedelics.<br /><br />Im all into customer satisfaction and will offer great competitive prices. I will not deal with heroine or ketamine, sorry, I detest these types of drugs because I think they are counterproductive to life and I would not be able to live with myself if I would provide this to people. Other then that things are possible seeing that I am very well connected here.<br /><br />Its an honor to join the community here!<br /><br />-Mitanox

				Thanks for the welcome post K1ngk0ng!<br /><br />My prices (subject to changes) will be more or less this: (once I get my seller account on SR)<br /><br />(all prices are in euro&#039;s)<br /><br />LSD Blotter:<br />0-10 tabs 120 mics: 7,50 pc<br />11-25 tabs 120 mics: 6,50 pc<br />26-100 tabs 120 mics: 5,50 pc<br />101-500 tabs 120 mics: 4,50 pc<br />500-2000 tabs 120 mics: 3,50 pc<br />2001-4000 tabs 120 mics: 2,50 pc<br />4001+ 120 mics: 1,50pc<br /><br />0-10 tabs 250 mics: 10,50 pc<br />11-25 tabs 250 mics: 9,50 pc<br />26-100 tabs 250 mics: 8,50 pc<br />101-500 tabs 250 mics: 6,50 pc<br />500-2000 tabs 250 mics: 4,50 pc<br />2001-4000 tabs 250 mics: 3,- pc<br />4001+ 250 mics: 2,- pc<br /><br />MDMA (Crystal, but crushed to powder for easy shipping, it is however 100% the real deal, I do not cut my stuff, never)<br /><br />1-3 grams: 50,- per gram<br />4-10 grams: 35,- per gram<br />11-50 grams: 30,- per gram<br />51+ grams: 20,= per gram<br /><br />All packages will be k9 proof and show no obvious telltale signs. I will ship using different envelopes, and different drop points to minimize the risk of packages being seized. Double vacuum sealing is standard. I will not ship more then 2000 tabs (4 pages) of blotter or 7 grams of MDMA per envelope, so your orders might arrive in different envelopes. I will not send more then 2 envelopes per week to 1 addres. This is all to minimize risk. If your order is larger then 2 envelopes you will have to wait a bit to get your complete order.<br /><br />For each order in the EU i will ask 10 euro shipping + handling cost per envelope. For the rest of the world I will ask 20 euro. I will not ship to Singapore, Iran, Iraq &amp; Thailand (Also for security reasons).<br /><br />As a promotion I will waive shipping &amp; handling costs for the first 10 first time buyers and give 20% off of their first order.<br /><br />Please tell me if you like the prices or if they should be changed. Pictures of the goods will follow.

Extra forms must be filled out and more precautions made.&nbsp; A greater likelihood of goods getting caught is customs, especially in light of escrow service, means a greater likelihood of not getting paid. All of the factors contribute to &quot;unreasonable&quot; international shipping fees. Something as small and discrete as LSD tabs may offer some relief from these grievances, but I have yet to deal with LSD so I&#039;m not really sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;Personally I never ship anything besides Priority or Express when shipping international, which means a minimum $15 fee.

				Not sure why there isn&#039;t more love here. Great service.<br /><br />Just wanted to note for others looking - Avatar tabs are very significantly more potent than e.g Buddha/Ganesh or Shiva. Bit of a tease to say that with Mitanox being out for the time being, but very much worth paying a premium for.

				Just received some grams of ORANGE MDMA from Mitanox to mid-west US. Received in 5-6 days including the weekend. Everything as described, looks perfect, smells delicious, reagent test perfect (I always do this just for the fun of it) AWESOME low-key packaging. Slight delay in ship but &quot;I&quot; did not even notice, anyways, they sent waaaaay overweight for delay as a good gesture, BONUS!!! TOP communication. TOP professional vendor here, genuine concern for their customers. ***Mitanox was said to be one of the top 2 vendors for MDMA choices by Global Moderator nomad bloodbath, Ivory being the other.***Hence the reason I went ahead and order grams instead of gram. I have tried Ivory&#039;s and was good. NOW it&#039;s this vendors turn. 5/5 all the way around--will update when consumed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your service Mitanox!!! I appreciate all you do!!!

Back then I didnt experience the psychedelic qualities that Ketamine can give, especially when its S+Ket. I changed my mind a bit. Although K is relatively more destructive to your body then &quot;real psychedelics&quot; I now dont think I have the right to withhold anyone from having this experience by denying them access to quality K. And the fact that it sells good and makes me cash also helps of course ;) Anywa, dont be concerned, the stuff you got is top shelf!

Back then I didnt experience the psychedelic qualities that Ketamine can give, especially when its S+Ket. I changed my mind a bit. Although K is relatively more destructive to your body then &quot;real psychedelics&quot; I now dont think I have the right to withhold anyone from having this experience by denying them access to quality K. And the fact that it sells good and makes me cash also helps of course ;) Anywa, dont be concerned, the stuff you got is top shelf!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thxs for the reply.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t TOO concerned, just a bit miffed when I read your msg.<br /><br />You&#039;ve sent me primo LSD and i&#039;ve heard nothing but good things about your S enantiomer ketamine, that&#039;s why I bought it from you :D<br /><br />Maybe modify that post though so it doesn&#039;t look confusing ?
