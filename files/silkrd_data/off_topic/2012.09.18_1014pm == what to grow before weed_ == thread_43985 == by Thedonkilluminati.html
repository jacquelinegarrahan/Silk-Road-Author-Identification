				i was about to say tomatoes.... gg beat me to it. give it a try. and worst comes to worst, if they are all ruined and dead, they were just fruits (or whatever the fuck tomatoes are lol).. of course it is not the same at all, and with growing weed practice makes perfect, but if you have absolutely no experience with growing anything then its a good start<br /><br />if you wanna try growing drugs, i suggest opium poppies. unless you plant acres you really wont have any sizable amount of opium to harvest, but it will give you some amount of relevant experience. also, the flowers are very pretty and not technically illegal until you score them for the opium latex

				I used to be a serious grower, even made it into HighTimes!! :)<br />As everyone said, tomatoes are the way to go for practicing. <br /><br />Poppies though, are an entirely different ballgame, almost the complete opposite of what you need to learn for cannabis. <br /><br />When you&#039;re ready to grow, I can send you free genetics, as long as you provide feedback/photos during the process.<br />I&#039;m always looking for testers.<br /><br />Good luck on your grow!!

				You should grow tobacco. Its really easy! Just put it in a windowsill and water it every day, and it will grow REALLY tall! Then you can smoke it when its all grown up.
