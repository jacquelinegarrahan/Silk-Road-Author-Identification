				Of course MDMA is the perfect chemical for house parties or just staying in with a partner or friends but whenever I go to a rave or go out with just pure MDMA I always feel I&#039;m lacking stimulation and end up feeling a bit lethargic. <br /><br />What would you say is the best chemical to mix with MDMA for added stimulation for raves and what sort of dosages would you recommend?<br /><br />-MDMA and a small amount of Meth or Amphetamine? I heard some of the best 90&#039;s E&#039;s were Mandy with a small amount of Amphet in them.<br />-MDMA/MDA? (One of my personal favs, but I still sometimes get the floored/smacked out feeling)<br />-MDMA/Methylone? (maybe added stimulation, possible synergy?)<br />-MDMA/MDAI? (anyone tried this? heard its meant to be quite good)<br />-Any other recommendations? Would be interesting to see what was in the old school 80/90&#039;s E pills...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve taken MDMA followed by 2c-b as the peak is wearing off and that was nice. Any good taken at the same time? I can imagine it getting pretty fucking intense if you take too much 2-cb though..

				I&#039;ve had the same issue, so I usually just take 120 mg mdma with around 40 mg amp or slightly less meth if available. Some have made claims that the amphetamines bind more readily at your 5-ht receptors, potentially blocking some of the mdma potency, but I haven&#039;t noticed it. It always gives me that energetic push I need instead of melting into a puddle&nbsp; :)

				IMHO, candy flipping (LSD + MDMA) is the way to go, especially for all night raves :) Depending on what kind of buzz you are after, adjust the dose of LSD accordingly. Personally, I love about 120ug LSD and a couple of hours later, about 150 mg MDMA. Works a treat for me - everyone is different though, so I guess you&#039;ll need to find your own sweet spot...have fun doing it if you get around to it :D&nbsp; :D

				@gtzgeorgz, I&#039;d say go with the amp. The meth may keep you up for a good while longer after. <br /><br />@MaidMandy, I hadn&#039;t had the chance to properly candy flip until fairly recently....dosed about 150ug lucy then followed with a 150 mg MDMA bomb two hours later. The next 3-4 hours were pure bliss. It was like the lsd and mdma would take turns, turning me from euphoria to deep introspection, and back. I guess that&#039;s where the term flipping comes from, lol. But yes, this is the best combo there is, followed closely by mdma and 2c-b :)

				Hey Georgzie bruv! Thought I&#039;d drop by to add a few things in here....<br /><br />Thing is I usually take a multitude of different drugs when partying or chilling at the same time....I think it depends on the situation you&#039;re in when you are taking these combo&#039;s of drugs as to what effects you want to experience.<br /><br />MDMA and cocaine is an obvious one for me......Then 2C-B/E on the tail end....Maybe a lil ketamine before the 2C....Just a tickle like! ;)<br /><br />MDMA and amphetamines are also good together, Especially if out raving etc...Phet gives you the energy to keep on dancing hard!!! :P Not so much Meth, but I do like to smoke it the next day if it&#039;s about... :D<br /><br />If I&#039;m just chilling, bong hits of bud are gorgeous on MD! I just love that shit!!! Maybe a bit of DMT changa for the tail end....<br /><br />Moxy &amp; MDMA is also really nice.....As is MDA/MDMA....But you know me G....I just love it all!!!! haha ;) No more Opi&#039;s though...Done with that sheeeeiiiiitttt!!! :)

				I would start with the MDMA and shrooms taken at the same time pretty much, heard the comeup can be pretty intense off those two though... then once you&#039;re up and peaking, rail a small line of MXE. When the peak starts to die down, take the 2c-b. <br />Should be trippy experience for sure. :)

				I know you&#039;ve already said that MDMA/MDA makes you smacky but 90mg MDMA and 80mg of MDA is superb. Failing that 100mg MDMA with a 30mg drop of 2C-B after your rolling for about two hours does magic for the comedown. Also, LSD &amp; MDMA is a sexy as hell combo. I personally like to low-ball the LSD around 100ug/150ug and wait until I&#039;m settled (~3 hours in) then drop my 125mg of MDMA. For balls to the wall go 300ug+ then slam a 150mg MDMA when you think you can handle it.<br /><br />Happy times!

				No more than 10mg meth, and your golden dude. The meth is strong as shit any more than 10mg may over power the MDMA a bit.

				100mg MDA and 1 hit of LSD was pretty cool, but not my cup of tea. Felt like the acid kept me away from the &quot;speedy&quot; feeling of the MDA, but the visuals were pretty good. I was also at home, not at a rave or anything. Id say this mix would be really cool at a rave.

				actually LSD and MDMA are the best combo. the synergy is just outta this world! They compliment each other well. <br />but in capsules when I just want a good roll, I&#039;ll usually have a mix of MDMA and some amphetamines in there to make my roll more speedy.

				Well I dropped 140mg of MDMA, then about 2 hours later I dropped 90mg MDMA and 30mg Amphetamine, didn&#039;t really feel much different so maybe I have a naturally high tolerance to amphetamines or it actually was not ~80% as stated. Stayed up dancing right till the end anyway then came back and did a few more lines of mandy, so good night over all and didn&#039;t really have that much of a bad comedown. :)<br />Next time I will try 50mg amphetamine dropped with my initial dose of MDMA and see how that sorts me out.

				going to have to go with a surefire answer here and say:<br /><br />LSD + MDMA<br />feel liberated to the tenth^ . complete and absolute bliss. i am deeply in love with this combo, <br />although should be an insightful and rare combo because of the amazingness of it<br /><br />METH + MDMA<br />you just feel sexy, and want to fuck every bitch that walks on two legs(with standards at least) hehehe<br />meth alone to me, feels quite like ecstasy, but when combined it just ups the &quot;anty&quot;!<br /><br />easily my two favorite combo&#039;s to date involved with MDMA.<br /><br />=)))<br />

				300ug of LSD, then once you&#039;re up and the peak starts take your mdma (we always take a dose then a bump approx 60-90 depending on person/quality approx 45-60 minutes after first dose of mdma). Once you&#039;re rolling hard snort 2c-b (or take it orally same time as mdma if you&#039;re afraid of the burn)<br /><br />LSD + mdma + 2c-b = weeeeeeeeeeee :)

				well i went ahead last night and did my cap of 120 mg local mdma, 100 mg ILF&#039;s mda and 20 mg of reichs mxe for a concert and then a redose of 100mg more mdma so 220 mdma 100 mda and 20 mxe by the end.&nbsp; I&#039;ve honestly never rolled so hard in my life, and ive done some pretty damn high doses of just mdma by itself.&nbsp; Not sure if i really noticed the mxe i mean i kind of remember losing my balance more than usual but then again this was only my second time with mda also.<br /><br />altogether ILF&#039;s mda is potent as fuckk
