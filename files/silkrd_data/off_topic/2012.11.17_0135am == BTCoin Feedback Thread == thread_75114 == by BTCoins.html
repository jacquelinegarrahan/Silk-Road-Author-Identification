				Just to ad further detail, I ordered 12 bitcoins.<br />Price was £80 for 10 and £18 for the 2<br />Total: £98<br /><br />No fee&#039;s, no pissing about with exchange rates and VERY quick, (mine took a couple of hours).<br /><br />All in all, completely satisfied with the transaction.<br />&nbsp;My only trepidation, was the fact that you are risking the initial outlay with no ESCROW or resoloution centre/comeback should anything go wrong.<br />&nbsp;Which it didn&#039;t, but it was a bit nervy initially.<br />Nothing ventured, nothing gained though... and having a trusted vendors backing is always a confidence booster.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:D

				2nd order with BT COINS (UK Pharma) completed.<br /><br />&nbsp;I messaged UK Pharma for a quote through SR this time.<br />&nbsp;He quoted £208 for 26 coins and I had them in my SR account within half an hour of transferring the funds to his bank account.<br /><br />Actually, the Vendor made a mistake and sent my 26 coins over twice! So I currently have 52!! :)<br />&nbsp;Luckily I&#039;m an honest guy and have messaged him to point out the double transfer.<br /><br />Excellent result and great trading price on both occasions I have used this service now.<br /><br />Thanks!!<br /><br />&nbsp;:D

				Very good and efficient service, will definitely use again.<br /><br />Seems to log on multiple times a day, so you can be assured that if you need bitcoins in a rush.<br /><br />Also, I made a mistake and sent too much, he offered to either give me partial bitcoins (which isn&#039;t in his policy), or to refund.

Why the fuck would you pay this scumbag in the first place? There are hundreds of topics with relevant information on getting BTC in the UK/USA/EU/North Pole etc and people are still getting scammed. <br /><br />To be hones I&#039;m glad you got scammed it&#039;s only your fault, fucking read, people like me try to help people like you not to get scammed by taking our time posting info on BTC. There is no particular reason I am doing it for but it&#039;s kind of disappointing when you see the little bitches coming back, complaining that they got scammed.

				Inquired about Btcoin cost, was presented with a price in minutes, was initially going to get 3 bitcoins, then opted for 10 because of the good price&nbsp; positive feedback, 10 coins were charges at £8 each, after payment these were transferred into my SR account within minutes... i couldn&#039;t believe how quick, easy, and cooperatively prices the service was.... it sure beats mtgox, intersango, and taking your chance with MIrC vendors... just poised to make my second btcoin order,,, i will update accordingly...&nbsp;

				&nbsp;???<br />I&#039;m not convinced he is a confirmed scammer yet, it could just be technical difficulties.<br /><br />He has 100% positive feedback from his seller account (UK Pharma).<br />&nbsp;And it would appear, plenty of good quality stock readily available, so why would he suddenly turn rogue?<br /><br />Both dealing I have had with him were effortless and the communication was excellent.<br />&nbsp;So before we tarnish his rep with the scammer tag, maybe consider if there is another factor at play here?<br /><br />however, this does not explain...<br /><br />Lack of communication over the past few days, which is odd.<br />Also, all his listings have been taken down?<br />There is an update mentioning about his bank having IT issues but nothing about going incommunicado.<br /><br />Really we need to give the Vendor a chance to explain whats going on in the next day or so, before calling shenangans...<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Peace &amp; Love<br />BF

				I have now received my coin from UK Pharma thisafternoon. Thanks to the impatience of some posters on here quick to label him a scam, and other overzealous posters quick to put down newbies (thecrackhead) I became convinced I had been scammed (the fact he didn&#039;t answer his messages until 2 days after didn&#039;t help). This is not the case, anyone that has bought coin will receive it soon I am sure. UK Pharma is a good guy and I just hope he deosn&#039;t loose any business because of this.
