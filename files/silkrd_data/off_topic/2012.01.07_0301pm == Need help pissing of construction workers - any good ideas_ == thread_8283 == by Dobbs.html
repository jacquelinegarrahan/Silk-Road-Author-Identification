				The building I live in has been under construction for about a year.&nbsp; This construction wakes me up every single day, even weekends.&nbsp; Buzzkillers all of them!&nbsp; <br /><br />I need some ideas on what I can play through a stereo, out my window (there&#039;s an outside patio they are working on), that will really make them cringe, at the least could make them work faster, or even just make my life happier knowing they hate it.&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve come up with the audio from gay male porn (straight guys would cringe I think, not me though lol), and really bad death metal.<br /><br />However, acknowledging the combined IQ&#039;s of most of you on this forum, I decided to put it out here for some better ideas.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp; I cant stand them anymore and there&#039;s nothing I can do!

				look up the band &quot;anal cunt&quot; on youtube. Should make even headbangers cringe. Any related videos would probably suffice as well.<br /><br /><br />could also go the route of biebs, rebecca black, miley, jonas, etc.

				blast Merzbow, Throbbing Gristle&#039;s &quot;Hamburger Lady&quot;, Daniel Menche, and there&#039;s this other noise artist whose name escapes me but he did an album called &quot;The History of Aids&quot; and made some babies ears bleed at a show.&nbsp; KKNull would probably do it too.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you feel about noise music but if you can handle it, it&#039;s a good solution because not many people will tolerate it

				Also Wolf Eyes is another good one to play.<br /><br />If you really want, get an amp with a microphone plugged into it and put the mic to the amp and create a feedback loop and just let it go, or if you have any music pedals you can loop them all to eachother and then out to an amp and create some bad ass feedback noises to either mess with or just to annoy people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let the noise revolution begin!

				People hate knowing they&#039;re being video taped. Even if there is no recording. Just the thought... YIKES!! Walk passed w/a video camera. Flip the screen around. Let everyone know you mean business. Maybe send a film about bad worker habits or code violations to there boss, bldg management or code enforcement.&nbsp; Lead them to believe anything is possible.&nbsp;

				Hey psychedelicbees1, the artist you&#039;re thinking of, with The History of Aids CD, is Prurient. I&#039;m seconding the noise music suggestion. Blasting some Jason Crumer, or a Whitehouse track like Wriggle Like A Fucking Eel would definitely clear the party out.

				all this stuff about playing gay porn and sexual related stuff is stupid as fuck. Not only are you going to piss off the construction workers; But if anyone else hearing it has any balls they are going to fuck you up or at the least make you stop playing. This will happen people have children and fine ass wives that dont wanna hear that bullshit. You know how shitty of a job they have? I understand how annoying it can be but they actually have to work.

				...generally construction workers (or the Companies..) don&#039;t give a shit about anything.....mopping around...drilling..digging up roads...noise....leaving work half done blocking roads...they really couldn&#039;t give a rats arse about the chaos they cause.<br /><br />the suggestions have perhaps got out of hand, but you gotta start somewhere...<br />

				There&#039;s always like 4 construction workers standing over the same hole having &#039;another smoke break&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I just light up a smoke and walk over to them and just start talking with them as if I know them/work with them.&nbsp; When they realize i&#039;m just a pedestrian they get pissed, so I tell them &#039;what, I was just having my smoke break too&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Usually by this time they&#039;re so pissed off or the situation is so awkward that they all will go right back to work lol.&nbsp; Probably went right back to smoking 5 minutes later, but gives me a kick to fuck with strangers with my anxiety doesn&#039;t have me by the balls that day.
