				What was the original weight?&nbsp; I imagine it was sealed in some way?<br /><br />I have had MDMA, coke, and MDPV go through the machine without much problems... you&#039;ve just got to let it dry out<br />

				shit&nbsp; :o&nbsp; you got lucky. I lost a gram of 2C-B in the wash. Only realised when I pulled a clean, empty baggy out of my shirt pocket. <br /><br />Your MD will be fine, tip it out of the baggy onto a clean sheet of paper and dry on a radiator, definitely don&#039;t throw it away!
