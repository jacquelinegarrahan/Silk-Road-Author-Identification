				I&#039;m looking forward to being a new vendor in the near future. Before I do so however, I am doing as much research as I can so I&#039;m able to provide great service and also be safe about it too.<br /><br />A question I would like an answer too is one I can&#039;t find an answer to anywhere and would like to know what other people do. When you become a vendor and you mail items out, what address do your(the vendor) items come from? Home? Work? A randomly rented out place? Or can you use a P.O box? I&#039;m asking because I&#039;d like to find the cheapest way but also a safe way at the same time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a lot of posts about becoming a seller and buying. However, if someone has any posts they would highly recommend if you&#039;re going to become a seller I would great appreciate it if you provided a link to the post!<br /><br />Thanks guys,<br /><br />-peengwinz

				Non-vendor here, though I&#039;ve considered it, and I always thought to use a real but dead address. That way, if something gets returned, it does wind up in a mailbox somewhere, but it&#039;s incredibly unlikely that anyone will pick it up. Then roll by that address now and then and check for returned items, should you have reports of packages not getting to their destination.<br /><br />Again, non-vendor, but from what I&#039;ve read it&#039;s better to have a real address than a fake one, &#039;cause the post office does keep track of that information.

Maybe how to please customers, how to attract customers, how to do business properly, etc. I&#039;m not clueless about these things but I would like to be able to study it as much as possible before becoming a vendor. Any links you could find would be great or even recommending certain books I wouldn&#039;t mind.

				If you are going to be sending packages, you wouldn&#039;t want to send them with a return address of a PO Box that you are actively renting out. For return addresses, use WhitePages.com. Look up addresses to popular businesses in your area/close to your area and use those.<br /><br />Make sure the ZIP code you use on the return address matches the zip code of the originating post office to diminish any suspicion. <br /><br />If you want to keep everything tidy and secure, make sure you offer PGP encryption to your customers. This will make them feel safe and at ease.<br /><br />To attract more customers, offer specials on shipping. Maybe offer free priority shipping if they order two different items from you. Make sure your prices are reasonable as well, this will bring customers in for sure.<br /><br />Another way I&#039;ve seen new vendors take advantage of the expanding customer base is running contests/giveaways on the forums. Maybe as soon as you open shop, offer small samples to a few potential customers. They will be able to leave you feedback which in time will allow you to gain trust of people that are interested in purchasing your wares.<br /><br />Also potential buyers want vendors that offer good communication. Once you get up and running understand that if you are offering a product that is going to draw a lot of customers in, be prepared to have your inbox swamped with messages with questions regarding the products you are offering. Set aside some time each day to go through the messages and respond to them. <br /><br />Showing you care about customers is a huge factor in your success as a vendor. Make sure you keep your turnaround time frame realistic, to prevent crushing anticipation from people awaiting your product. Make sure you let customers know about any delays they should be expecting. <br /><br />As for your comment that you are not worried about the law; if you are going to be a vendor you should be. Make sure you make everything as secure as possible.<br /><br />Good luck my friend!

Thanks for the kind reply. I was planning on offering samples to people so they can do reviews on it and I think that will bring in a good amount of customers to get me started.

I modified my post with a few more things I think would be a positive aspect of your business practice.<br /><br />Also remember to always keep an open mind. People like vendors that cater to their personal needs. Always keep an open mind and you will do just fine.

				I have another question. I won&#039;t be able to start off big with having a LOT in stock but I did want to start with a reasonable stock(reasonable to me is a QP). I was wondering though, would it be okay if I started out with 1OZ in stock so I can go ahead and get started even though it&#039;s a small stock?

				Peen, I felt I should mention to take what VHS said seriously about the use of a PO Box.<br /><br />Do not let greed be your downfall; make sure to use addresses of companies or persons who can not be traced back to you; be sure to use REAL people/companies/addresses! <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The USPS knows if it&#039;s a completely fake return address, and if they cannot return to sender(if there is an error) then you&#039;re fucking your buyer by having your packages bounced to the &#039;dead mail center&#039; if there is an issue in which they have to return the parcel(shorted postage, invalid address, etc).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And if, God forbid, there should be a seizure of one of your parcels, if it&#039;s YOUR name on the PO Box on the return address, you might as well wear a shirt that says &quot;arrest me&quot; ...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Never play with matches; Never get burned.
