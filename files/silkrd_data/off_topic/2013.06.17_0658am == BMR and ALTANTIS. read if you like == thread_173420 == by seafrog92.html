				I have set up accounts on all the deep websites to see if they are better than SR. a very common topic in&nbsp; the threads lately so here you go. SILK ROAD WILL NEVER DIE. the community is friendly and quite frankly the largest of all ONION sites. ATLANTIS seems like a giant hoax, they might get there game up and running but so far i have heard of escrow funds being stolen so beware.&nbsp; BMR- be very careful. they are legit but they legitimately sell child porn and poisonous date rape drugs.<br /><br />hope this answers the curiosity<br /><br />I WILL ONLY ORDER SILKROAD. <br /><br />CHEERS&nbsp; &nbsp;

				JWM- good response. like I said they might get their game up and running but not with my money . this is more for new SR clients you seem to have more knowledge then me on the site. pros and cons balance in real life as they do in the drug world.( my understanding is with adding competitors it will only help silkroad come on top..)<br /><br />P.S. I believe what i posted will be somewhat helpful to people with the same curiosity i had. <br /><br /><br /><br />

SR has PLENTY of scammer vendors as well. <br /><br />
