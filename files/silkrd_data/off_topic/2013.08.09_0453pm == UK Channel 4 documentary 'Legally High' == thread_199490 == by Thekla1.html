				Hi all.<br /><br />This was broadcast last night 8/8/2013 at 22.00 in the UK. Here is a CLEARNET LINK to the catch-up online service,<br /><br />http://www.channel4.com/programmes/legally-high/4od<br /><br />I am not sure if this is accessible from outside the UK, copyright etc.<br /><br />It is a one hour doc on legal highs, but not quite your average moralistic shit. Obviously it&#039;s not about SR, but there is a lot of crossover interest, and definitely worth a watch. Interested to see your comments if you watch it.<br /><br />Couple of points -<br /><br />1) Mods you may decide this should go in the Drug Safety section.<br />2) Dr Zee claims to have invented methedrone, so does that out him as &#039;Kinetic&#039; who posted the first formulation on the Hive in 2003 or is he just bragging? <br />3) Fucking glad I don&#039;t live in Redcar, Yorkshire. <br />4) I watched it on good ol&#039; hash and a glass of red. They can keep that shit.<br /><br />Take care.

That&#039;s why so many people where going over. There&#039;s a good documentary with George Lamb, channel 4 he goes to different peoples homes and sits with them while they take all manner of legal drugs.

				Hello all,<br /><br />Generally I don&#039;t post on forums, I just lurk and read a lot but I&#039;ve spent the whole evening working up 50 posts so I can reply to this thread! Good documentaries can make me a touch over-enthusiastic... It&#039;s not as thought it had a plot per se, but it&#039;s prob fair to warn ***SPOILER*** alert for the following post...<br /><br />And Legally High was a great doc. Fascinating yet alarming. That must have been a bit of an exclusive having &#039;Dr Zee&#039; if that was his first appearance? I&#039;m not that knowledgeable on the history but seems nobody was aware of him? <br /><br />Even if he claimed not to be in it for the money, I reckon his Dutch colleague definitely was. His totally legit business, selling legal chemicals for a totally different &amp; illegal usage in direct opposition to the legal cover story that enables him to operate - interesting irony there. He must have some pretty decent lawyers, I&#039;m sure the authorities would love to put him out of business. <br /><br />I&#039;m intrigued about the expensive &amp; thorough testing he claimed to do too - do you think that was true, or some very clever marketing? I could almost hear the nation&#039;s youth let out a huge sigh of relief - &#039;he tests it all, we&#039;re gonna be fine!&#039;. He&#039;s never looking at a law suit if users disregard the &#039;not for human consumption&#039; advice, but surely it would be hard to live with yourself if there were unexpected adverse effects from a new product, that weren&#039;t apparent when he dosed himself up - maybe he really does do good testing.<br /><br />I loved meph as much as the rest of the planet seemed to, but didn&#039;t actually realize what it was initially, RCs were a new concept. By the time I understood, the &#039;not for human consumption&#039; warning gave me pause for thought. Briefly. I fiended on that stuff right up to the ban (probably a very good thing for my nose, I truly found it much more addictive &amp; moreish than crack) and I do truly miss a good night out on meph (I haven&#039;t looked in to getting any on the Road, as it seems like the good old days of guaranteed product &amp; purity are over). But meph was it for me. Exploring a constantly expanding huge range of mysterious brand new chemicals with complicated names does not appeal, even if they are cheap and legal - it makes me feel old school, but I&#039;ll stick with the tried &amp; tested golden oldies of the drug world and leave the pioneering to others. <br /><br />Watching those kids in Redcar was truly shocking. Needles don&#039;t bother me but putting such a range of god only knows what straight into your vein, that stunned me - do you think many ppl mainline RCs? Perhaps I am completely naive to think they don&#039;t. I get why you would, but I just can&#039;t imagine amping up the risk factor that way and I can&#039;t imagine where you would be physically or mentally. Clearly pretty fucking intense. <br /><br />Clever cliffhanger too - where is Baxter. He hadn&#039;t died, I guess they couldn&#039;t track him down. Reminded me a bit of Reindeerspotting, an equally grim and less enjoyable documentary about some buprenorphine addicted friends trying to survive the icy misery of small town Arctic Circle Finland. Dark shit. <br /><br />Anyway, Legally High was epic. It made me feel hugely frustrated that prohibition forbids or discourages the proper testing and quality control that all drugs &amp; their users deserve, in particular the ever expanding range of RCs. I bet those scientists who were keeping a sample of every drug in the world would give their right arm to start running trials. <br /><br />Maybe the risk of finding RCs to be relatively harmless is too great - they couldn&#039;t bear to say &#039;You know what kids? Those legal highs aren&#039;t as dangerous as we thought. Sorry we tried to scare you silly!&#039;. Or maybe they find out some really bad news that&#039;s gonna suck for a whole generation 20 years down the line. Whatever, the sooner we learn more the better. The whole system of development is fascinating, tweaking the molecules and keeping one step ahead of the regulators. I wonder how long it will last - the possibilities are endless? <br /><br />There we go, that&#039;s my lot, bit longer than intended &amp; climbing down from soapbox. May well return to lurking and reading only now! Thank you for your patience if you made it to the end!

				The synthesis of mephedrone was first described over 80 years ago (Saem de Burnaga Sanchez, 1929). Saem de Burnaga Sanchez, J. (1929). Sur un homologue de l’ephedrine, Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France, Vol.45:284–286.<br /><br />However, the first Internet reference to it occurred reportedly in May 2003 (Power, 2009) http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Good%2 0Practice/Druglink_March_09_mephedrone.pdf

				just watched it, very nice documentary, nice to always see Dr John ramsey here and there in the UK documentaries. That manufacturer is a very interesting guy. But the part he said &quot;cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and LSD would have been forgotten if some system works&quot; confuses me..

				Yes Hearts, I have no idea what he was suggesting at that point. But if he has done all those chems and gets a little confused fair play to him. I&#039;ve been at an exhibition where I looked at 4000 year old Sumerian tablets that transcribed as descriptions of the joys of hashish smoking. I think RC&#039;s got a way to go to catch up with that.<br /><br />The smart kids from that doc will move to big cities, just like I did, and most of them will make it. That&#039;s what I think. I am sad for those left behind, but from personal experience, their choice. I got out.<br /><br />Take care.

				Baxter ends up taking heroin, now there&#039;s a surprise. I presume he&#039;s learned to operate a syringe one handed by now. And that posh girl was doing some serious gurning!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The doctor z stuff was interesting. I have to admit I haven&#039;t got a great deal of time for RCs. They mostly seem to be inferior versions of the classics. Having said that I haven&#039;t tried many. 2CB seemed to be like acid visuals without the amazing insights, and the physical side of ecstasy without the empathy. And what&#039;s the point of that? MDPV I found to be a stimulant along the lines of caffeine. Shit, thinking about it&nbsp; that&#039;s about the extent of my experience so I guess I should shut the fuck up. I&#039;ve got a copy of Pikhal and Tikhal though and to honest most of them do sound not as good versions of either MDMA and amphetamines. There&#039;s a reason MDMA was the one that caught on.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried some etizolam, guess that counts as a legal high...again I would say, not as enjoyable as Valium.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GBL when it was legal in UK kicked me and my friends arses....we probably resembled Baxter and his pals except messier.

				Thanks for uploading (karma+).<br />BTW it was quite depressing to see so many people act like that as skizo-junkies.<br />And also that chemist: dreaming of a world without legit drugs but full of RCs. Like if this would be the solution for drug abuse or something.

				I&#039;m glad Silkroad Forums keeps me updated with documentaries. I swear I cannot get enough of documentaries, especially ones about drugs, its effects, users, producers... blah blah blah. <br /><br />I love this community :)<br /><br />@fakename709 And yeah, you could see the effects of their long term use.. its sad because I&#039;m sure many fellow travelers on the road (so do I) have experience with friends like baxter, it can be tough to deal with, I use drugs recreationally but at times my mate goes overboard...
