No trouble with the law, fortunately, but that&#039;s the least of my worries. I broke my back, low, and my leg are paralyzed. One arm is broken as well.

				First of all, the easiest way to improve your life right now is to switch to one handed Dvorak keyboard layout!! <br />Go and learn it and you&#039;ll find it easier to type with one hand. Wooooh! Isn&#039;t life great now? =D

				No idea if Johnny works properly, haven&#039;t recovered nough to regain ANY feeling down there. Wearing diapers LOL (back off, pervs, no pictures!!)<br /><br />I almost want to learn that keyboard.... but since it&#039;s only broken and I type at 140wpm on a qwerty keyboard with two hands, I see no need. Thanks though!

I know people have it worse off than me, but I&#039;m very young and this is rather unfortunate.... and painful since low-dose oxy is useless. <br />(My tolerance isnt that high, it&#039;s just natural, they never give enough, and I&#039;m used to 20-30mg heroin once a week at least).<br /><br />Head is definitely up, I just care less about personal anonymity, hence my bitch-thread. I don&#039;t have long to live for other unelated reasons.

				@iLoveTaffy<br /><br />Sorry to hear about your back/legs. I just want to urge you to stay positive and keep visualizing a complete recovery. The mind is the most powerful healer known to man. Keep fighting and never ever lose hope!<br /><br />Wishing you all the Best

				Bad luck about the injury, are you able to give details on what happened?<br /><br />As for the pain management you could complain to your doctor and hope for something stronger, maybe he has a stash of black tar heroin ;)<br /><br />Best wishes dude

				Climbing accident. Doc won&#039;t. These faggy docs rarely prescribe something as powerful as what I&#039;m getting... totally dumb. I hate faggot doctors like that.<br /><br />I&#039;m not even looking to get high... shit hurts lol.
