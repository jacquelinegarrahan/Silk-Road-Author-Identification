				It&#039;s been a couple of years since I got my puppy but I&#039;d estimate $100-300.

				That depends entirely on where you live and what vet you use. Don&#039;t be afraid to call around and get some estimates. HOWEVER, I strongly urge to to NOT just pick the cheapest one. They&#039;re the cheapest for a reason.

It will cost about 200-300$ but could be more....we had a laproscopy done on our dog so he was a fortune. you most likely wont have to deal with that though. toy breeds with bb-sized testes. don&#039;t blame me blame the lady.....i&#039;d rather have some crazy shit like a Kangal or 100lb english bulldog that eats cats and neatly stacks their skeletons in the back yard.<br /><br />taken from some answer site:<br /><br />office visit, the shots, stool specimen tests, medications if needed, and having them fixed (if you decide to do this). Figure it will realistically cost you (minus getting them fixed) about a couple of hundred dollars for the first year. You should call a vet&#039;s office and ask them to give you a breakdown of all the charges that you might see during that first year so you can get a better idea, since it varies depending on where you live. <br /><br />L

				they are right, 100-200 i believe.&nbsp; If you get the puppy from a shelter like the human society they will come with the shots and not cost a lot, probably same price as the vaccinations alone. :P

				petco and petsmart sometimes do discount shots and what not. bandfieild also has some health insurance thing for a monthly fee and they inlcuded in the price so its cheaper.

				now i cant speak for dogs (im a cat person, dogs annoy me) or for prices in the us, but we have a vet franchise here called &quot;vets4pets&quot; (cheap and VERY good, at least our one is) i believe their prices are the same for dogs and cats, when i had my cats vacs done it was £35 or you could pay £100 for a lifetime subscription which pays for once yearly shots for your pets entire life, if somewhere over your end of the world offers the same deal id grab it as itll save you a lot in the long run
