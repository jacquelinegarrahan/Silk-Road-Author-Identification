				Too brandish, sorry. Wanted a discussion and I wrote it like a conservative radio host. My bad.......<br /><br />For those who haven&#039;t, give it a shot. Many times more pure, many times more euphoric (satisfying a coke euphoria but kicking then dragging its ass through the mud), many times more for your dollar, and at your door in 48hrs.<br /><br />Just check it out, and someone tell me their god honest answer of how they can like coke but dislike PURE methamphetamine?<br /><br />I want to try coke again, with a pallette clean. Everybody has the one thing that really ties you into a desire with the substance. I&#039;m talking healthy love, although there is a very VERY thin line.

All the best feelings, and OH MY GOD you are the hottest shit ever shat. Meth.... kinda puts you on your ass at first. It&#039;s a lot to take in.

				Shooting coke is fucking amazing... but you have to rig up like every fucking 15 minutes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do it anymore because it makes me look like a junkie.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to have a shot at meth (pun intended) but I haven&#039;t had the time.&nbsp; Last time (only time) I smoked meth I was up for 4 days.&nbsp; Redonk.

				That&#039;s why there&#039;s Viagra.&nbsp; <br /><br />How is shooting meth uncomfortable? If I do too much maybe. Coke and meth both make me feel like jumping out of my skin if I shoot too much. Like jumping out of an airplane in your living room. That&#039;s half the fun. ;)

				I used to do cocaine 4-5x a week, sometimes more for a number of years. Obviously I loved it, I loved the way it tasted dripping down the back of my throat, I loved the way it looked, I loved the whole ritual of chopping and/or grinding and dividing lines, or cooking it up.&nbsp; I also liked the mind blowing sex I would enjoy with my GF mid way through the night. One more thing I would enjoy, depending on quality, was being able to sleep an hour or so after the last line.&nbsp; <br />Any time I have tried meth, maybe around a dozen times now there were a lot of the same pluses except for the sex part due to meth dick :( plus, if was snorting it I would do a line every half an hour or so which caused me to be a paranoid wreck which probably caused the penile malfunction.<br />However, a couple of days ago I received a small bit of some of Heisenburgs&#039; crystal from a well respected member of the community.&nbsp; It was only a small amount maybe 40mg +/-.&nbsp; I bumped half yesterday at around three which gave me a nice little rush followed by a sparkling personality which I don&#039;t usually possess, plus an overwhelming urge to clean stuff.&nbsp; I did the rest today about 9 hours ago and I still feel great.<br />&nbsp;So I am torn between the two.&nbsp; I know me and I know if I had a gram of good crystal laying around I probably wouldn&#039;t be able to stick to a once or maybe twice a day dosing regimen once or twice a week.&nbsp; Just like I know if I had a pile of decent coke in front of me right now I would do it until my heart exploded.<br />So to sum it up if I had good self control with either of the two I would probably choose good crystal.&nbsp; But seeing as how I lack the control I just stay away from both of them as much as possible.<br /><br />T
