				Medical grade is bullshit. Since some states legalised for medicinal use every strain I see listed is medical grade or AAAAAAA***** grade. Any strain grown with some TLC can be medical or top grade. <br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean that any strain will be ok for someone who uses it medically. There are of course some that will assist with problems that others do not, e.g. Some are better for SAD or for depression, others for pain relief etc.

				This is just an extra spot for many of us, not the only spot.&nbsp; There is more here than just weed too.&nbsp; I can get more than a few things I enjoy here on a day to day basis.&nbsp; This is like the Wal-Mart of drugs, I can get some serious deals on some things, but others are priced high and sell due to the convenience.<br /><br />Here in Canada we usually pay between $5-$10 a G as well.<br />In the 70s Holland had the market cornered - US/Canada was flooded with cheap shitty mexican brick, with occasional rumours about Thai Stick, then BC bud became big in the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s, followed by the great Californian green rush that is still going strong.<br /><br />The secret... it&#039;s all good.&nbsp; The internet, magazines like High Times and books specific to MJ horticulture have improved weed around the world. If you&#039;re not a lazy-ass grower the only thing separating your weed from the weed anywhere else in the world is the available genetics, as technique is pretty much ironed out.&nbsp; Though to say weed today is stronger than it ever was is a falsehood, more growers know how to do it right today is all, there was always bombass sinse available somewhere.<br /><br />Lazy growers think they know everything and don&#039;t bother to read the literature, anyone who does know wtf they&#039;re talking about is constantly reading, studying and experimenting.<br /><br />Even if those are dollars, and not bitcoins in intent, that price is way too high.&nbsp; Seller must be smoking too much of his stock, or buying at a dispensary at full price and reselling for profit.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I can get indoor organic for $200 an Oz, and hydro for about $275 if I want to max out what I&#039;m paying.&nbsp; I typically pay $150-$175 for indoor.&nbsp; If I&#039;m cheap and just want a weedy taste, I&#039;ll by outdoor for $120-$150.
