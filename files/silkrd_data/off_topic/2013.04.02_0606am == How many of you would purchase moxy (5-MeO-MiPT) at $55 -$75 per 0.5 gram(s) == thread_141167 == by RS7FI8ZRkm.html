				Information<br /><br />~Effects:<br />This is an analogue of the more popular drug 5-MeO-DiPT (nicknamed &quot;foxy methoxy&quot;) and has the nickname &quot;moxy&quot;. Some users report the tactile effects of 5-MeO-DiPT without some of the unwanted side effects. At higher doses it becomes much more psychedelic and less tactile. But at doses of 4-10 milligrams users find 5-MeO-MiPT to be a very euphoric and tactile chemical. Its energetic effects can be very strong at high doses, increasing normal heart rate considerably. Sounds can be amplified in perception to a point where synesthetic effects (&quot;touching or/and tasting sounds&quot;) occur.<br /><br />~Dosage:<br />Orally, 5-MeO-MiPT is active at 4-6 mg. The drug can also be smoked, but unlike most other tryptamines, this route requires a much higher dosage. 10–20 mg is usually smoked. It typically produces a very strong odor.<br />Some users report activity as low as 1 mg while others report no activity up to 20 mg, this compound seems to be highly sensitive to the individual and any potential researchers should keep this in mind. Titrating the dose would be especially important with this compound.<br />Some users report little to no visual activity until doses of 10 mg or higher are taken. This chemical proves very useful for opening up and expressing ones self much like MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and may be a useful chemical in psychedelic therapy.<br /><br />source: wikipedia
