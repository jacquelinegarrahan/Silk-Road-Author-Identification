				I used to have a terrible habit,&nbsp; I could not be without at least a weeks supply, hated running low or even worse, occasionally going dry,&nbsp; I hated my habit, it controlled me.<br /><br />they were the days when I bought exclusively off the street,&nbsp; before I was enlightened and learned a better way.<br /><br />now I am able to buy and take delivery within days I dont get the extreme anxiety or need to squirell vast quantities away. I can order what I need for a good weekend or whatever then not order again untill 48 hrs or so before I need it.<br /><br />I am still an addict but with the help of SR I can control my habit and for the first time in years feel like I am in control.<br /><br />Thank you DPR and all who make SR what it is.<br /><br />

				Hehe, if you don&#039;t read the OP and only read the title, the first thing that springs to mind (at least for me), is &quot;duh, because it sells drugs!&quot;<br /><br />On a serious note though, good stuff :-)

				And the SR community makes sure to tell everyone of the quality.This way vendors have to make sure to have the best quality in stock. unlike on the street where you dont know what exactly you are putting in your bodyl

				I feel you.&nbsp; Since I discovered SR I only shop online.&nbsp; It has helped me remain ultra incognito of my habits to my friends and has helped me become more selective as to what I put in my body anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />That and there&#039;s nothing like the look on our friends faces when you pull out some quality drugs and they wonder&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Dam you still got connects like that?&quot;<br /><br />Nodding,&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;yup, it&#039;s like that&quot;.

				I only buy my drugs online now too. My friends used to make fun of me, until I showed them LSD 5 times the potency of the filth they acquired locally.

				I only started using drugs a few years before SR came around and I&#039;ve got to say I think the best way to control a habit is with drugs in the mail. You&#039;re not running round to a dealers the minute you run out of anything. You have to buy btc, you have to put them through wallets and once you&#039;ve ordered what you want, it takes a few days for it to come through. It&#039;s good to know by judging from a good vendors page that there&#039;s a 99% chance the drugs WILL arrive.<br /><br />I know people will think I&#039;m stupid for saying this, but I really don&#039;t think I&#039;ll become an addict as long as I use SR.<br /><br />Drugs in the mail. That will never stop being genius!

				I agree with some of this, but for anyway... SR is the ONLY reason I was motivated/facilitated to try #4 heroin due to lack of sketchy associations, and IRL stigma, etc. This may have been a bad thing as I have an addictive personality. I do/did too much blow... and recently have looked to H (I love speedballs, probably my favorite non-psychedelic high) for some &quot;landing gear&quot; and as a distraction from the white. It&#039;s worked actually, I still crave the coke, but stay away from it. But now, I find myself inclined to grab a small sack here and there to relax and as a sleep aid, and this chipping scares me a bit. I know I am strong enough to stay away from it to point where it takes over my life, but the allure of it is something else. It has some mystique almost. Anyway, the SR &quot;window shopping&quot; is so hard to resist and enables my low impulse control. This type of scenario could run into a problem. Not necessarily for me (I think as I am pretty grounded these days,) but for some literal children that may be on here and others with issues. SR is the ultimate enabler. Not that I am trying to shoot the messenger here, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. But some food for thought.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I window shop any chance I get, or I am reading useful information on the forums in regards to security and vendor reputation and happenings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, let me know if you find any good H vendors.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been watching myself, but still kind of sketched out at the idea of getting H in the mail.<br />I&#039;ve been building my buying stats in order to find a vendor with H that won&#039;t force me to FE &#039;cause of my buying stats.&nbsp; Ordering little samples is the way to go anyways with a vendor you&#039;ve never ordered from.&nbsp;

				I love being able to eliminate the anxiety-ridden process of buying off the street: driving to and from the dope man paranoid about cops, paying whatever prices he charges because I can&#039;t find it anywhere else, having to wait around forever for them looking conspicuous, paranoid as fuck... Gotta say I don&#039;t miss that shit at all. It&#039;s great because you can&#039;t compare shop anywhere close to how you can with SR in real life. There isn&#039;t a review page for IRL drug dealers... gotta love that about SR.<br /><br />If you think about it, if everyone used SR rather than buying on the streets it would actually eliminate a lot of crime related to the drug game. In a way, LE should be thanking SR for that.<br /><br />SR also helps me keep my drug habit at bay. I feel like I have more self control knowing I have to wait forever, rather than knowing I can just drive 10 minutes and get something whenever I want. I had a bad habit for awhile, but with SR I just get fucked up every few weeks or so rather than spiraling back into hopeless addiction. Definitely makes me appreciate DPR that much more.
