				Maybe it&#039;s just paranoia, but that kind of thing is necessary here. I&#039;ve certainly seen some weird stuff on this forum since I&#039;ve been here. Mailing and packaging advice with one or two rules way off. Just... odd stuff. I find it fascinating really. I want to know what sort of psyops stuff has been going on here. I find it odd, too, since generally psyops stuff is immediately identified as such by (justifiably) paranoid members. I&#039;ve been identified as LE myself by one, very unfortunate member, who believed some really out there stuff. I was flattered that I might be LE, but my friends I&#039;ve talked to all think that&#039;s really scary. But I&#039;m on fucking tor and don&#039;t actually say much about anything illegal I might do.<br /><br />Anywayz, psyops discussion thread? What might be happening here, etc.?

				I think it&#039;s the CIA hypnosis through posts in the forums. They are controlling us through their posts.&nbsp; <br />Don&#039;t give in man, you aren&#039;t suppose to notice or mention it.

				But seriously, <br /><br />I don&#039;t notice much .&nbsp; It&#039;s a drug forum filled with people high on drugs saying stupid shit because its anonymous. <br />I think people try to mind fuck others.&nbsp; I get it all the time. Now I just dont. care anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got too cosy here and let my guard down.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t make friends here or chat too much personal stuff. <br />It&#039;s designed for tech support and discussions.&nbsp; So I find getting too frindly and nice here makes me say too much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, so I write strange shit purposely to fuck up any trace they might be on me.&nbsp; It&#039;s annoying but im safe.
