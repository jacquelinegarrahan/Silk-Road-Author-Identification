				Can you really trust those venors it seems to me a good ploy to get BC as far as I can tell their is nothing is stopping these vendors from making very few winners and taking all the BC for themselves who&#039;s to stop them?

That way everyone can check the real number, without wondering if it&#039;s just been made up and chosen to suit the vendor.

				I guess everyone is taking a risk doing these sorts of things. I would assume that the more trusted/well-known vendors wouldn&#039;t play around with BTC and would actually host legitimate lotto&#039;s.<br /><br />I remember seeing a few lotto&#039;s a while ago that had something to do with &quot;If your transaction number ends in 3, you win 0.25BTC&quot; or something like that. Kinda hard to rig those when each transaction number is auto-generated and not made up by the vendor. I would try and go for those if you insist on taking part in a lotto.

				They can&#039;t scam when using the transaction ID or real life lottery numbers.&nbsp; They can certainly scam when they &quot;pick a name.&quot;
