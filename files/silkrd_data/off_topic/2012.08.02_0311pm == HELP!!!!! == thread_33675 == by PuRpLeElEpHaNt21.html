I started out trying to get some btcoin from him. i messaged him and he messaged me back. after that i messaged him shit ton more trying to contact him HE WONT REPLY!! its been like two days! the reason im worried is because i ordered the btcoin option from him twice. Once without my moneypak code in it and later on WITH the moneypak code in it. He stilll didnt reply!!! Then later yesterday the order options for both orders said finalize early. I clicked them both cuz i wasnt sure which one was the one with th moneypak code. i thought he would send them to me once i did that but he hasnt yet and i am starting to freak out. WHAT DO I DO?!?!?!?!!!!

You got mugged-off on possibly the stupidest shit I have seen and you can&#039;t get your funds back without risk of incriminating yourself. Brush the dirt off your shoulders, move on and also stop whining about it because it wont change. <br /><br />This whole thread is an absolute fuck-tard fest as it is. You got Twat-Dalf the Gay on one hand trying to win the shittest advice of the year award and then someone who is crying over $100 because they tripped over their own stupidity.

				103 dollars, seriously? Just cut your losses and move on, you got scammed, it happens to most new users who have no idea what they&#039;re doing, try not to make the same mistakes again in the future.

				LOL nice rants kids, sorry if my direct-approach at calling idiotic shit offends you and all. I&#039;ll fetch your comfort blankets so you can feel that you are in a safer environment. Personally though if idiot realizes that calling up Moneypak because you got ripped off on an illegal drug site is stupid then I&#039;ll have done him a favour, if in a harsh way. Cry me a river Justin, cry cry cry.

Moneypaks have worked great for me, but I deal with vendors who have good track records. Enlighten me on your superior methods.<br /><br />Limetless, your posts have me pissing my panties in laughter. The vulgarity directed towards the OP is completely warranted. Some of the people around here seem to think that SR is like a WalMart, complete with a customer complaints department and return counter. Newflash, mothafuckas, SR is the online equivalent of dealing with shady characters on the street corner. You&#039;ll still get your ass virtually mugged if you don&#039;t do your homework.

				The problem with using moneypak is that you have absolutely no protection whatsoever. Once you send your code, your funds are completely at the mercy of someone who has total anonymity. I see you only joined this week so you may not have heard about it, but even some of the most trusted and reputable vendors on this site (Tony76 being the most well known) have at some point decided to cash out and used their trust to scam people for thousands. <br /><br />It has happened again since then, and it will happen again in the future. It would be absolutely naive to think moneypak vendors wouldn&#039;t potentially do the same thing. By it&#039;s very nature, moneypak transactions have to be done out of escrow, and going out of escrow is the worst thing you could possibly do on this site short of posting an unencrypted address. <br /><br />Here is a link to a method that has been flawless for me so far.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=29230.msg346084#msg346084<br /><br /><br />Also, don&#039;t mean to be a nag, but I REALLY hope that avatar isn&#039;t actually a picture of you..
