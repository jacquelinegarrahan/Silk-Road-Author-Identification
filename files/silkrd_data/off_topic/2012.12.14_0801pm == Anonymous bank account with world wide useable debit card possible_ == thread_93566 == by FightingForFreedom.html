				So the thing is this. Soon I want to become a full-time traveler, because that has been my dream for a few years now.<br />Now I&#039;m planning on making money through sites like these where I want to sell goods or services and get paid in bitcoins.<br /><br />BTC is nice and all, but if I want to buy a loaf of bread I will need to be able to pay the old-fashioned way with old-fashioned money. Now one advantage of being a full-time traveler and not having an address is that there is no country to which I&#039;m obligated to pay taxes. However it will probably be harder to get a bank account somewhere. Moreover, even if I am able to get a bank account somewhere I&#039;m afraid that it might become suspicious if my only source of income will be mtgox and it might become a big source of income.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if authorities will then start to try to track my activities. And if so, is there a way to get an anonymous bank account? A bank account where I don&#039;t have to fill in my name or can fill in a false name? But with one that provides a debit card that I can use anywhere in the world? I assume that&#039;s not possible, because it sounds too good to be true, but I thought nothing ventured, nothing gained.

				It&#039;s possible, you will need a passport in another name, preferably a different country than the US. You will need substantial funds, around 100k just to fund it properly. PanamaLegal seems pretty legit, I&#039;m using them right now.

				Find personal sources that you are willing to do cash/bitcoin transfers with. (Think localbitcoins.com)<br /><br />Buy physical products with your bitcoin and cash out in the county you are inâ€” you can also do some work or provide services to get paid in local cash.<br /><br />And of course, check out the book I sell, &quot;Bye Bye Big Brother&quot; ;)

				Oh yea, for my method, you need at least $25k just to get started.. so echo&#039;s is probably the cheaper route :)
