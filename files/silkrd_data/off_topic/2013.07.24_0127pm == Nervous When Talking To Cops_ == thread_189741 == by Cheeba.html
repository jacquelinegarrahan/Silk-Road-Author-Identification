				Hey guys. The other day, I had a run-in with an officer who was called to my house. I was expecting some friends over, so when I heard a knock at the door I assumed it was them and immediately opened it for them. What I saw before me was a police officer with what looked like a permanent scowl tattooed on his face. He immediately started questioning me as to who I was. I had been waiting several days for a package from SR and I assumed that they must have intercepted it and have come to arrest me. The cop started mentioning that they&#039;d gotten a call for something different that I&#039;m not going to mention, which seemed to rule out SR. He quickly and commandingly asked if he could come in, and out of shock I stupidly agreed to let him. <br /><br />I was so shocked that I didn&#039;t know what to do exactly, and he wanted to look around the place. I&#039;d been looking at SR a minute beforehand and still had it up on my computer, so I was sweating bullets like crazy. He started questioning me really hard about the reason why he was there, and wanted my ID which I&#039;d left in my room and had to go and get. I think I was visibly shaken, as I was stuttering a bit when talking to him and looking around nervously. Luckily when I was back getting my ID, he didn&#039;t take it as an opportunity to really search my house hard, and when I gave it to him he looked through some of the rooms in my place, was satisfied and decided to leave. I was physically shaking for about 10 minutes after he left, and I felt nauseous for a good few hours afterward. Luckily I was just on the Silk Road forums, so it wouldn&#039;t have been immediately obvious what I was up to even if he did enter the room my computer was in.<br /><br />It occurred to me after that, that I&#039;ve never really had any run ins with police before where I was considered a suspect for anything and actually had to deal with their cop manipulations.&nbsp; It made me realize how incredibly ill-equipped I am to actually speak with or handle cops when I have anything to hide. And it made me think that there must be some way to get more experience with it so that I feel more comfortable the next time something like this happens.<br /><br />Does anyone here have extensive experience speaking to cops that are trying to bust them? How do you get more comfortable with that? I&#039;m pretty worried about this happening again in the future, and I want to know what I can do to get a handle on this.

				I was out clubbing with some friends one night and we decided (stupidly) to do some cocaine in the middle of town center next to some toilets.<br /><br />Well just our luck, two police men walked by and noticed us acting suspiciously and asked what we were dong there. I quickly and wittingly answered &quot;Just about to take a pee sir!&quot; and he did believe me as he didn&#039;t conduct a body search.After that we spent the next 15 minutes nervously chatting to these police men with about an 8 ball in my pocket! hehe<br /><br />My only advice is to say to your self &quot;How would i act and what would i say if i didn&#039;t have any drugs on me and in that manner (we were quite drunk) was to act a bit stupidly,etc. So we did and we got&nbsp; a way with it! Hoorah!

				NEVER EVER let the police inside your home without a warrant! <br /><br />Know your rights and excersize them!<br /><br />Also the cooler you play it, the less suspicious the cops will get. They are trained to &quot;smell your fear&quot;. They watch out for people acting nervous/suspicious around them. Then they will know you have something to hide.

				Hoho. My friend I can understand your behavior.<br /><br />The first time I had to interact with cops was pretty much shocking experience as well. We were at a beach smoking weed and all of the sudden police arrives. That was a really hard moment, and I would probably have gotten caught only because of my nervousness if my friend who was with me didn&#039;t know the cop.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />After the first time you interact with the pigs you will get more used to it. <br />The trick is first of all to learn your rights. This is really important. Noone can come in in your house without a warrant. Play it cool and very defensive. Don&#039;t answer to questions besides who you are. <br /><br />I have had after this incident few more interactions with the police and it went smooth even though sometimes I have weed with me or had just smoked it. Then I can say that I am really good in taking the control of conversations. Have traveled a lot and have avoided dangerous moments with just talking.<br /><br />My best &quot;acting&quot; with police was last summer I was going around my village packed with about 10 grams of weed and then the police stopped me in the middle of the main square and started to ask questions and wanting to search my bag. Well, I took the best defensive stance I could get. I started to yell at them with a very very serious style.<br />&quot;How the hell can you come out of nowhere without any evidence or warrant and demanding at you will search me? nThis is my village, right now everyone is looking at us and think that I am a smuggler. I run my business here and I earn my profits just because I do very good PR. Now you come up and just because you want to you destroy all my image I have achieved all these years. Who are you in the first place? I didn&#039;t even get your names.. <br /><br />I was either lucky, or did actually mind fuck them and they just left.. <br /><br />So my last advise is: Don&#039;t ever lie, thats a big mistake, but try and train your social and mind fucking abilities. Yes they are cops, but still human and all human can fall in a good acting.<br /><br />Be well my friend and be safe above all.<br /><br />Adamiz<br />&nbsp;

I still use the peep hole to see who it is first.&nbsp; If it were a police officer I either wouldn&#039;t talk to them or would talk to them through a screen via my kitchen (the window is near the front door).<br /><br />I want to know what he was there for!

				OP you need to watch the video called &quot;Flex your Rights&quot;. I think it is available on youtube, otherwise just find a torrent or something I won&#039;t link for obvious reasons.<br /><br />It informs you of how to act in police encounters and what rights you do and don&#039;t have. It has saved my freedom multiple times.

				&nbsp;First time dealing with cops I was in highschool. We had just blazed in some wooded area behind a restaurant located on a dead end street. There was a parking lot for the place right in front of the area we went to blaze. As we were walking back up, we got stopped. I had a little over a gram of weed in my inside coat pocket and a pipe in my combat boots.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The cops had said they had calls in of people looking into cars in the parking lot. (An obvious lie to give them proable cause) The only thing that saved our asses from getting searched was my &quot;yes sir, no sir&quot; attitude. My other friends were wise asses, and the cop even mentioned they should act more like me. <br /><br />&nbsp;I find talking to them with respect works very well. The one cop had even thought he &quot;befriended&quot; me. We would bullshit from time to time. And after a while he would ask me questions about suspected dealers in the area. He came to the conclusion i was a valuable source of information, so all the b.s. i gave he took seriously. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;COP: &quot;So i hear this guy has been selling coke&quot;<br />&nbsp;ME&nbsp; : &quot; That guy hasnt lived here in months, moved down to florida montha ago sir&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;20 mins later i go to his house, get myself a gram, and let him know cops were asking about him.<br />

				I got pulled over the other day with a large amounts of drugs in the car, right after collecting from a drop. I was nervous as fuck, assuming it wasn&#039;t random and I was driving a clean inconspicuous car registered in someone else&#039;s name.<br /><br />&quot;Hi officer, how are you?&quot;<br />&quot;License&quot;<br />*Pulled out my license*<br />&quot;Are you aware of how fast you were just going?&quot;<br />&quot;Honestly sir I&#039;m a bit sleep-deprived from work at the moment, I wasn&#039;t aware that I was speeding but if I was I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m usually very careful not to speed because I&#039;ve lost a family member to a road accident before&quot;<br />&quot;I&#039;m not going to give you a ticket today but you might not be so lucky in future, you can&#039;t be going #km in a #km/hr zone, have a good day sir&quot;<br />&quot;I will sir thank you, I really appreciate the job you guys do keeping the roads safe for us&quot;<br />&quot;Thanks mate, take care&quot;<br /><br />Two lessons: One.. never break road rules while carrying drugs. Two... always act polite and upbeat in random situations like this while asserting your rights at the same time if necessary. In Australia cops can pretty much search your car at any time without any reason if they want, so I knew my only defense was to act really friendly and apologetic.
