As such it doesn&#039;t really matter if it&#039;s £4 or £8 to the Bitcoin - $100 of Bitcoins is still worth $100.<br /><br />The only time that problems arise is when people buy Bitcoins, fail to spend them and the Bitcoin dips in value. The simple solution is only to buy as many BTC as you need and know in advance what you&#039;re going to order.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
