				In about 2 months I&#039;m going on vacation. I weighed out the risks and benefits and decided I would try for a light psychadelic on the plane ride to my destination.<br />The flight is going to be about 2.5 hours. The things that I&#039;m looking for is a nice, light and floaty drug that&#039;ll be fun but not TOO much fun. (I&#039;m not looking to be videoed and put on YouTube haha). I also want to still be able to interact enough to get by without looking high and the trip should have a duration of under 3 hours. Any ideas will be much appreciated.

				Last time i flew, my buddy gave me a Cheeba Chew, which is pretty much a Tootsie roll covered in potent hash oil.<br /><br />Although I was waay too high when I was waiting to board my flight, once I got on and we took off I had no problem relaxing, reading the Dark Tower. Had a great flight

				Heroin/oxy&#039;s either one, I like to IV before flights that way no matter how uncomfortable the plain is, I feel like a piece of toast melting in the chair nodding away. <br />Everyone will just think you&#039;re really tired and before you know you&#039;re at your destination.

				i like vodka mixed in orange juice when i&#039;m on a plane.&nbsp; something about the nourishing aspect of OJ and the clean drunk from vodka really suits that experience for me.<br /><br />i&#039;ve known people who&#039;ve tripped on planes and it sounds pretty terrible to me.&nbsp; those seats are so fucking uncomfortable man....<br /><br />benzos are the drug of choice for most frequent flyers.&nbsp; i imagine K might be nice, but i wouldn&#039;t want to be messing with my sinuses through all those pressure changes.<br /><br />so, Spacewasp&#039;s advice:&nbsp; Screwdrivers or Valium/Xanax/etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />just don&#039;t combine them.&nbsp; yuck.
