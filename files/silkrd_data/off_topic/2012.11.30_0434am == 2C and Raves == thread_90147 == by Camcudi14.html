				What would be the best 2C to do at a rave? A friend and I are arguing but we want other opinions.

				I will put a vote in for 2-CB. Just tried it for the first time the other day and It was great! I could totally see doing it at a rave, maybe even mixed with some MDMA for the ultimate experience. The only other 2C I&#039;ve tried was 2-CE though, so don&#039;t consider me an expert. My 2-CE trip wasn&#039;t very exciting, as I found it to be very mentally taxing, rather than visually and bodily entertaining. However, the stuff I got was local so who knows what it really was&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Got my 2-CB off of the road and loved it!<br /><br />

				2c-b for sure, its similar MDMA and contains light visuals which are a nice touch for a rave experience. I personally don&#039;t enjoy have visual psycs at raves. 2c-b is also speedier than the other 2cs.<br /><br />My second vote would be 2c-I.

				Yeah, I should have added that 2C-I gives you crazy visuals and a 2C-B trip is more like a roll but still trippy with some visuals.

				I&#039;ve only ever done 2cb, and I think it would be fun at a rave. The visuals to me are outstanding, and it gives you a kind of &#039;loved up&#039; feeling similar but not as intense as MDMA. It also feels a little speedy which you might enjoy if you are going to be dancing a bunch.
