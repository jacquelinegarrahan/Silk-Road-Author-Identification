				I have been reading the web about how mj helps Lupus and arthritis, seriously, by suppressing the immune system.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been smoking since I was a kid, and stopped for a few years for career reasons.&nbsp; During this time of abstinence I came down with and was diagnosed with Lupus.&nbsp; Ever since then I&#039;ve been smoking again with great results!<br /><br />I prefer sativas because I don&#039;t like couch lock.&nbsp; Lupus gives me couch lock lol and I&#039;m looking for stuff that will help me get off the couch!<br /><br />Any savy growers out there with any med knowledge on the best strain for Lupus and arthritis sufferers would be MUCH appreciated, as I am mostly in the market for meds to keep me healthy.<br /><br />Peace.

				Neville&#039;s Haze, or any of the classic Hazes, for that matter. Flying Dutchmen&#039;s Original Haze offers a very trippy up high that will have you looking through your phone book for someone to go do something with.<br /><br />Jack Herer is hands down my #1 sativa choice for pain relief that allows you to function. Hit it hard, and it will still fuck you up into next Tuesday. Potent shit that even some of the most experienced user experiences occasional flashes of paranoia, but overall quite a cerebral high with a high ability to function quotient.

Jack Herer is possibly the best bud I have ever smoked. Normally after a joint or two I&#039;m happy to just sit and chill. After a joint of this me and a friend hit the clubs and with frequent subtle tokes, it kept us going aaaaallllll night! What an awesome strain this is......she&#039;s a fucker to grow though so prices are high.

				@dobbs I&#039;ve been partial to chocolope lately. I also randomly got a hold of Moonshine Haze which won the 2011 cannabis cup sativa winner, quite tasty and I was extremely motivated.

				Thanks Julio!&nbsp; Your jolly ranchers are good!&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna try some chocolate over the weekend.&nbsp; One jolly rancher was too much, I think a third is good for me.&nbsp; Love them!

				In my experience the chocolate is stronger, so I&#039;d do a third of one of the partitioned pieces.
