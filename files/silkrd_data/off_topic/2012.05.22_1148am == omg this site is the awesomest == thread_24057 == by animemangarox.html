Welcome to the road mate.<br /><br />This forum is great... read and educate yourself :) Can&#039;t go wrong with a little knowledge in your pocket.<br />

				I was never a fan of Eminem, and I was definitely into rap, mostly mixtapes. I seem to be the only one though. I just never liked his lyrics, he often used words that made no sense or added nothing to the song just because it rhymed.

				It&#039;s not the slang I don&#039;t understand, I mean I used to listen to some hood ass rap before it turned into a fashion show, it&#039;s just it&#039;s a lot of unnecessary phrases to describe something so mundane. Eminem isn&#039;t the only one that I don&#039;t like because of their lyrics, most rappers now days all they can rap about is how much money they have and what they spend it on - boring shit. Compare it to a Kid Cudi song that talks about real life shit, shit people can relate to:<br /><br />&quot;Soundtrack 2 My Life&quot;<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />I got 99 problems and they all bitches<br />I wish I was Jigga Man, carefree living<br />But I&#039;m not Shawn or Martin Louis<br />I&#039;m a Cleveland nigga rolling with them Brooklyn boys<br />You know how it be when you start living large<br />I control my own life, Charles was never in charge<br />No sitcom could teach Scott about the drama<br />Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom<br />On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind<br />Got me most of what I wanted, how&#039;d you do it mom, huh?<br />She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself, why he by himself?<br />He got two older brothers, one hood, one good<br />An independent older sister got me fly when she could<br />But they all didn&#039;t see, the little bit of sadness in me, Scotty<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Ive got some issues that nobody can see<br />And all of these emotions are pouring out of me<br />I bring them to the light for you<br />It&#039;s only right<br />This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I&#039;m super paranoid, like a 6th sense<br />Since my father died, I ain&#039;t been writing since<br />And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe<br />Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe<br />I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice<br />Just to show the kids they ain&#039;t the only ones who up at night<br />The moon will illuminate my room and soon I&#039;m consumed by my doom<br />Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck<br />It&#039;s all said and done and my cock&#039;s been sucked<br />So now I&#039;m in the cut, alcohol in the wound<br />My hearts an open sore that I hope heals soon<br />I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun<br />Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon<br />So it&#039;s more than life, I try to shed some light on a man<br />Not many people of this planet understand<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I&#039;ve got some issues that nobody can see<br />And all of these emotions are pouring out of me<br />I bring them to the light for you<br />It&#039;s only right<br />This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />It&#039;s close to go and trying some coke<br />And a happy ending is slitting my throat<br />Ignorance the coke man<br />Ignorance is bliss<br />Ignorance is love, and I need that shit<br />If I never did shows, then I&#039;d probably be a myth<br />If I cared about the blogs, then I&#039;d probably be a jackass<br />Don&#039;t give a shit what people talkin&#039; bout fam<br />Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck<br />Hope I really get to see 30<br />Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty<br />Most of the clean faces be the most dirty<br />I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I&#039;m hungry<br />Ass all chunky, brain is insanity<br />Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali trees<br />And I get both, never truly satisfied<br />I am happy, that&#039;s just the saddest lie<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I&#039;ve got some issues that nobody can see<br />And all of these emotions are pouring out of me<br />I bring them to the light for you<br />It&#039;s only right<br />This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

				Kid Cudi NOW is horrible, but when he was coming up (A Kid Named Cudi, Man on the Moon I) had songs full of meaning. Same goes for a lot of rappers, but who listens to the radio for rap? Unless your into teen idol and lady gaga bullshit the radio is dead. I used to get my CD&#039;s from dudes selling their own mixtapes on the corners in South Beach Miami, then some good websites for mixtapes came out like Datpiff.com, now days rap is just dead in my eyes. I haven&#039;t seen a single good *artist* come out of that scene for years now.<br /><br />For my tastes, music in general now days is pretty shit. Maybe I&#039;m just getting old, but I listen to EVERYTHING - From Gucci Mane to Adele, from Oakenfold to Muddy Waters, from Hendrix to Nirvana. I&#039;ll admit Adele blew me away with her vocals, I prefer female British singers and I don&#039;t know why, Corinne Bailey Rae is another I like that my friends all give me shit for.<br /><br />But really what new music has come out that is worth a damn? Seems electronic music is on the rise in mainstream US again, but while I like Oakenfold, Paul van Dyke, and Kaskade - I&#039;m not liking any of the new shit, the Skryllex and Deadmau5 I&#039;d like if I was in a club maybe but otherwise it has no emotion in it for me like most Oakenfold tracks do.<br /><br />For lack of a better option, I&#039;ve mostly been listening to and rediscovering 90&#039;s alternative bands, a lot of the 1 hit wonders had plenty of great songs on their albums that never got popular for example Marcy Playground first album has some gems on it.

The kind of crap people in the ghetto do in their back alley doesn&#039;t count. Real battles require improvisation. The improvisational skills Eminem brings into rap is fucking amazing. There are techniques where you think of a certain bunch of words that rhyme with each other so it really isn&#039;t that hard. It&#039;s amateur poetry at best. But with the intensity Marshall Mathers uses vocabulary blows my hair right off my head. This asshole goes around FREESTYLING, using vocabulary words that most of my friends didn&#039;t even know at the time. And on top of that, he&#039;s makes it flow so well, you&#039;d think it&#039;s written. Now don&#039;t tell me he&#039;s famous for just being a white rapper; &quot;cuz that&#039;s some ignant shit&quot;.<br /><br />Lil Wayne, self-proclaimed &quot;Best Rapper Alive&quot;, conceded to Eminem&#039;s abilities being far superior than his own... ON CAMERA.You think someone an ego the size of Lil Wayne would admit that on camera without reason? I mean his new shit&#039;s just feeding the black-hole of crap called the American music industry but you have to give recognition where it is earned. The guy&#039;s got talent in this modern cultural art!
