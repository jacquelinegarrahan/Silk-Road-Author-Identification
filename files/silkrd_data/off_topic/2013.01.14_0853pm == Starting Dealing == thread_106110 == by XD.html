			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello people, <br /><br />So recently a friend of mine, not a close friend just a friend-friend (that I occasionally talk to) said he wants to start dealing drugs like weed, cocaine or few MDMA tablets to earn some extra dough in this rough economy. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the best idea (since it&#039;s a very dangerous career (if that&#039;s the right word) path and not one of the best if you aren&#039;t experienced), but whatever, its his choice. I just got intrigued by it, how do some people start off with no experience or no connections? It&#039;s not like you can just go out on the street and start offering whether it be cocaine or weed or whatever to random people passing by. And since this is in UK, there isn&#039;t a big market for cocaine (since it is cut to shit most of the time people just tend to use something else, and a lot cheaper), nor can you walk into a nightclub or a bar and start dealing, nor anyone wants you to, to be perfectly honest. A lot of people really do frown upon drug dealers that sell hard recreational drugs like cocaine or MDMA, even in complete shit hole bars or nightclubs. <br /><br />So do any of you have any interesting stories to share? On how you or someone you know started off with nothing or similar? I&#039;m just intrigued what people have to say, and what stories they have.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Be Safe,<br />XD.<br /><br />

				i suggest you get a reliable hook up first and then try to start selling through him/her.<br />using an already existing customer base.. maybe you&#039;ll lose some money but its better then starting from scratch... <br /><br /><br />getting lots of reliable customers can take years... if you are rushing you are doing it wrong and will end up in jail....

				I would imagine it would be extremely hard to get into if you know nothing about it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t deal anymore.&nbsp; I got into it when I was younger and the product around my whereabouts was shit.&nbsp; I was very good at networking and marketing and went way out of my way to get a better product.&nbsp; Bring in a product to a market at a lower price and better quality than is already there and the product will fly out the door.&nbsp; I kept my circle very small and preferred to deal in bulk.&nbsp; Purchase in bulk and resell bulk amounts to another vendor who would then resell to another person that would then resell to the user.&nbsp; This prevents people with fiendish behavior coming to you.

				Trying to become a dealer doesn&#039;t work unless you are a very social person and have exposure to alot of people who want to use drugs. Of course the different products will attract a different crowd sometimes (for instance if you have a job and know some decent people you can become your secret work weed dealer... can be very lucrative and make relationships with colleagues interesting), and also will have different ebbs and flows in terms of production and demand ( If you are a weed dealer you will probably be hassled every day, as an mdma dealer you will probably only get hassled in the lead up to big events or before the weekend).<br /><br />Ideally the person would want to be involved in some kind of music scene to start with or have extensive personal networks. Personally I write music that is meant to be listened to on drugs, and I meet alot of people who want them, so my career and my business run parallell. It can get a bit much because it&#039;s hard to escape a life of hot women, free drugs and free money. Anyway - ideally you don&#039;t want to be in retail, that&#039;s way too much exposure. If you can source bulk at good prices, and find say 3 or 4 regular customers who will buy it from you at a good margin you&#039;re pretty much laughin. What you don&#039;t get without long experience is the dealers instinct... In this industry people are going to try and use you, scam you, and if you&#039;re not in a great scene people will try to stand-over you, extort you and rob you. And then there&#039;s the po-po. Once you&#039;ve been doing it long enough you kinda know the people you want to associate with and who you will let in your circle.&nbsp; But getting to that point can be a fucking misery. You gotta really love the game to keep doing it.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Someone that I know deals at work. People know him for being crazy and doing drugs but few know him for dealing. He only deals to people he trust and only sell bigger quantities with better than average quality. Safety procedures are agreed beforehand and they buyers aren&#039;t junkies that are a pain in the ass. There are no talks related to the subject on the telephone.<br /><br />He can get most anything for the right price but his specialty is hash; he gets excellent quality bricks of hash in bulk.<br /><br />His first goal isn&#039;t the money, tho. He only cuts a small portion of the product, when he does it. He&#039;s doing it for the social influences.

				Good luck and be safe. Don&#039;t trust just anybody, only sell to trusted people. I would even avoid obvious addicts, if possible.

				Thanks everyone for the answers, much appreciated. <br /><br />I see most of you say it&#039;s all about trust, which I totally agree. Too bad, most people will rat you out as soon as they get caught, so it takes a while to get trustworthy people to buy from you. I just got a few more questions. Is the money any good by actually being a street level dealer? I was thinking about buying few ounces or so, e.g. of cocaine, and then selling them to the street-level dealers, which I suppose you could make a lot more money out of it and avoid the risk of getting in contact with police or crazy-ass junkies everyday. <br /><br />I think starting with weed would be an option at first, and then moving on to harder drugs like, cocaine or MDMA, but the bad thing about it is, to make any decent amount of money you&#039;d have to sell a lot of weed. And there is already a lot of weed dealers here in UK and most of the people grow their own or get them for chump change from friends who do grown their own, so it would be hard to break into the game, that&#039;s why I was thinking into breaking into the hard drug market, since it&#039;s extremely hard to find a dealer who sells decent hard drugs, and if they do, the drugs are cut to shit (if you buy a gram of coke, you just get 5% of the actual coke, and the rest is baking soda or baby powder. So you&#039;re basically buying very expensive baking soda or baby powder.)

You can be a really active &#039;street&#039; dealer, doing stuff in clubs, and so on, but your face will become well known, people will know you are a dealer, and you may attract the attention of police.<br /><br />The other way is to gather around you a small number of people that are reliable, and are not junkies or desperate people. To them you sell in bulk, as zeke says above, and they just sell retail or however they want. This insulates you.

You can be a really active &#039;street&#039; dealer, doing stuff in clubs, and so on, but your face will become well known, people will know you are a dealer, and you may attract the attention of police.<br /><br />The other way is to gather around you a small number of people that are reliable, and are not junkies or desperate people. To them you sell in bulk, as zeke says above, and they just sell retail or however they want. This insulates you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Listen to these two they&#039;re getting it right, also if you&#039;re not a violent person don&#039;t be granting ticks like their written agreements. rookie mistake<br /><br />I havnt been in the game for a good few years now but all you have to do is focus on your customers and keep them loyal.<br /><br />I suggest you ask around for a few dealers numbers, pickup abit of weed off each person for a couple of weeks then try and build up a relationship with each and slide your product into their hands. This way you&#039;ll at least get yourself in the door.<br /><br />Try to find out what they get it in for and either undercut it with a similar product or get a better product and sell it at the same price, then its only left to their logic which is the better purchase. Take a friend to the deal, maybe two if its extra dodgy.<br /><br />Once you have your customers you can level out your prices and increase profit abit more.<br />Remember that you may make a larger profit margin with shit weed but when you have the dank it will fly out better then any skunky profit margin!<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t think about other markets until you know what you&#039;re doing in the world of weed first.<br />Good luck!

				Dealing is a business like any other.&nbsp; Thats the best way to approach it.&nbsp; Analyze the market, check for trends, high demand on certain products, competitive pricing, steady supply,&nbsp; Establishing customer base.&nbsp; As with any business, it takes money to make money.&nbsp; Investment capitol is very important.

If you want to last you need to be able to adapt to all things business throws at you.

				yeah the OP sounded like he wanted to get into the RL scene. <br /><br />you are right though, if you have a SAFE, regular supply, then SR is definitely for you, of course if there is a decent profit margin after your overheads (vac sealer, umpteen packs of latex gloves etc, enough petrol to make sure your mail drops cover at least a 50 mile radius). remember fingerprints can bleed through latex gloves, so double up on them when handling anything you&#039;re sending out, make sure your packaging area and your packing area are TOTALLY separate rooms at least, and the final packing area is completely clean from any substance including alcohol used for washing prints etc - just any&nbsp; scent a dog might pick up on.<br /><br />but yeah - back to the RL scene - forget it mate, as i said - if you have to ask you&#039;re never going to know

				&nbsp;yesterday a street dealer just came up to me and asked me if he can help me out. (H)&nbsp; &nbsp;nice fella.<br />but this looks like a very risky thing to do!! if you want to deal long term&nbsp; don&#039;t do shit like this!! approaching people you have never seen and offering them shit is gonna get you fucked....<br /><br /><br />on the other hand.. i started to think about selling cheap imported cigarettes around here to my workmates. Stuff like this could be a good start for&nbsp; anyone interested in dealing. Hell this shit might end up being better then selling dope.&nbsp; the money is good, lots of people interested and there is a lot less paranoia.
