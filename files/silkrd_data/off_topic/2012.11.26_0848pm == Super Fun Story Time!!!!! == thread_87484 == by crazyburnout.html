				Robert falls to the floor, leaving Charlie free to do his bidding unrestrained. Charlie promptly seized upon Robert, bound him at the hands and feet with adhesive tape, and chuckled, &quot;I have you now fucker&quot;, while snorting a small pile of what appeared to be a white powder off his knuckle.

				The LSD is hitting Robert quick and hard. He thinks the white powder is sugar and licks the rest of Charlie. This combination will go, where no other drugs have brought him before.

				A low rumbling sound interrupts the players. It vibrates at a steady pace, but then quickens. Pictures, knick knacks and dishes are being strewn about madly, as if the mental realm shared by our two heroes has somehow become physical. Then in a flash of sounds, smells and fury; a stampede of wild horses charges through the living room window: snarling beats breathing misty vapor being chased menacingly by zombified corpses of reanimated Nazi commandos. The two adversaries realize that to survive this new land and make their way back home they must now work together. They head toward Mt. Reacharound, fully intent on stopping the Scientologist conspiracy and rescuing their famous friends from Dr. Flopnick and his brain ray.

				(Enters Bruce Campbell) <br /><br />More like stumbles.<br /><br />He&#039;s wasted on GHB and has a shotgun. There are zombies, not regular zombies, but Walking Dead zombies mixed with 28 days later zombies. He shoots two of them in the head, downs another vial of GHB and beckons our heroes to come join him in his old Pontiac and head down the lone highway, toward the foreboding castle, just over the horizon.

				Bruce is cocks deep in some pink liquid sex juice and forgets what the fuck he is doing. He oscillates back and forth on the two-lane highway&nbsp; arbitrarily, laughing at the height of his pitch. Mssrs. Sheen and Downey forget their momentary antagonisms and respective psychodislocated consciousness-spaces and exchange foreboding glances. There is a twinge of sexual tension, which is interrupted by Mr. Campbell jacknifing his Pontiac around an uncommonly sturdy cactus. A few nearby zombie stragglers begin staggering towards the vehicle. Campbell is unconscious, but the two protagonists, stimulated into psychostimulated/adrenified action sauce, remain aware of their surroundings. They attempt to drag Campbell to safety, but the situation is dire beyond helping. The walkers grab hold of Bruce and make a feast of his flesh. Charlie has the presence of mind to seize the late driver&#039;s shotgun. Rob points to the cactus around which the car was wrapped. It was a megacomplex of smaller, spineless cacti growing into the heavens. Each lump manifested several disc-shaped button like structures, coin sized and brownish-green.<br /><br />&quot;Holy fuck,&quot; Charlie gasped. He and Downey locked eyes again. &quot;We just crashed into peyote mountain.&quot;<br /><br />Meanwhile, the horde has paused in its feasting. Bruce Campbell has turned.

				Bruce is now something like the boomer from L4D, puking out margaritas that he had with the cast of Burn notice. While mr sheen is actually still alive and finds some coke still under his nostrils, heaving that in, remembering that he has TIGER blood in him, he opens the car door and shoots a hole into Bruce. <br /><br />
