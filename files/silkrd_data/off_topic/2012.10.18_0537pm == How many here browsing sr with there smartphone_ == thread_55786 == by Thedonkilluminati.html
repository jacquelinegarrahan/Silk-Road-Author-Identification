				Ive used orbot myself to check up on SR as well, never placed an order yet, Is there a PGP encryption for the phone as well?&nbsp; However I have to additional questions for someone who may know the answer better than I would, Is there any additional security issues I should be aware of on a mobile platform and I had heard a rumor that cell phone companies don&#039;t track your internet usage as strictly as a normal ISP, is this true?

				Guilty. But on my phone I only log into a special, &quot;phone-only,&quot; 0.00-BTC account that I never use for orders or correspondence. I operate under the assumption that my non-jailbroken/non-rooted smartphone is sharing everything I do with everyone on Earth, but if it is, all anyone will know is that I like to window shop at SR.<br /><br />While ordering drugs on my phone while stuck in traffic is quite possibly the most awesome fucking thing I can imagine doing, I prefer to keep all my SR-eggs in one basket. Err, wait, that has a negative connotation. But in this case it&#039;s a good thing, assuming your basket is heavily encrypted and plausibly deniable.<br /><br />Another thing that makes me wary of Orbot is that it has to be getting less scrutiny than, say, the Tor Browser Bundle, meaning any potential security holes are more likely to go unnoticed and for longer. Maybe Orbot and the Browser Bundle aren&#039;t even that appreciably different, but I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Not trying to plant seeds of paranoia here. Basically all I&#039;m saying is &quot;I don&#039;t know much about Orbot or smartphone security, so I assume it&#039;s not as safe.&quot; This is a good default mindset, but I&#039;m open to being convinced otherwise.

I wonder if you had a rooted android phone with a full Linux kernel if you could boot into a mainstream Linux OS and use secure remove that way? got to look into that. And as far as verifing what orbot leaves behine, we should be able to use the Android VM for developers to see what gets changed when orbot is installed and run.
