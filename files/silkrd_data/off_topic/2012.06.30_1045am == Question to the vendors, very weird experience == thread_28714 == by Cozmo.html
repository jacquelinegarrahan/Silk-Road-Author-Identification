				Hey guys, just a new vendor here, only 78 transactions.<br />But had an usual experience when i received an order.<br />The person who ordered lived like 1 kilometer away, i literally could deliver the package myself could even walk, wouldn&#039;t even have to drive there. (I didn&#039;t do it, scared shitless of being seen or worse)<br />Its just so weird to experience something like that. <br />Would anyone here have the guts to cut out the postman and deliver the package yourself?<br />What would you do if it was your next door neighbor? Family member?

				My very first... and I do mean my VERY FIRST customer who placed an order lived like 5 minutes from me... and yes it freaked me out... 1000 orders later and now I don&#039;t much think about it. I get orders all the time where I could make them a local drop off customer but I have tried hard to keep this an online only business...<br />The main reason is very obvious... if I were LE and I wanted to bust me I would have some stuff sent to an address close to the area where my packages come from then I would try to get me to circumvent SR and become a local customer...&nbsp; it wouldn&#039;t be long before they had you after that...<br /><br />Stay safe... stay on SR...<br /><br />TJ
