				Just more new world order propaganda.<br /><br />If you find shit like this interesting, do some research on the bilderberg group.<br /><br />the biggest alliance of rich folks, politicians, heads of state and countries all conspiring to decrease the worlds population to a controllable 5,000,000. Thats million, not billion. <br /><br />It&#039;s really worth watching a documentary or to if your into that kind of stuff.

				Yea, im happy to say im vegan, and stay away from a good majority of GMO foods aside from Soda and some juices. Over 30+ countries have a ban on GMO foods, and some of the ones that don&#039;t at least have a labeling system.<br /><br />Here in the States, the media won&#039;t even show stories about GMO&#039;s, they try to hide it from the people.<br /><br />There were massive protests in every major city earlier this year, and not one media outlet of the united states covered the story. <br /><br />The only thing that makes the news now is war, murder, sex scandals and celebrity drama.<br /><br />I&#039;m ashamed to even call myself an american, America is a cancer, lead by greed, lies, and dishonor.<br /><br />Honestly, i do agree the worlds population should be controlled, or at least you should have to pass an IQ test to be able to reproduce and have kids.<br /><br />I say the government starts with the gangbangers and swagfags.

				Joe Rogan interviewed that guy in his TV show &#039;Joe Rogan Questions Everything&#039;. It&#039;s episode 3 of the first season.<br /><br />He delves into robotics and the future. It was interesting but terrifying. It&#039;s on youtube if anyone&#039;s interested.
