				I&#039;ve seen at least 4-5 new topics all started saying the exact same thing. I got curious and registered an account, but didn&#039;t try buying btc yet from there. Anyone have any experience buying btc from them? Their exchange rates look real good, but they ask a good bit of personal info and there&#039;s a lot of traceable options for the payment method, so I have my doubts about how secure it might be, not to mention they ask a whole lot of info that could get passed on to LEO if they cave to political pressure.

				bitcointalks.com is the same as the btkoin.com scam. Don&#039;t send them any money. That spammer posts every day, just ignore him and ignore any offers to buy btc on the forum. You&#039;re supposed to only do business on the SR marketplace anyway.

They are attempting to cash in on the official bitcointalk.org forum name.
