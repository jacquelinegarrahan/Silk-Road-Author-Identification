				I am a fan of Iron Man, so i thought i was in for a real treat with this.<br />After hearing all the hype i can safely say, this movie is the most overrated pile of shit this century has ever seen.<br />There were some nice scenes and the CGI was good, but there was just way too much.<br />Too much going on all the time, couldnt wait for it to end, seriously.<br />Huge disappointment.

				It was pretty choppy with everything going on but I think it&#039;s safe to say most superhero/comic action movie is 90% cgi now.&nbsp; I thought it was ok but if I was a fan I can see where you&#039;re coming from.&nbsp; I think batman was really overrated and I&#039;m a big fan :(

				Thankyou!!!<br />I thought exactly the same thing about batman.&nbsp; <br />Look at the following movies, Iron Man and District 9.<br />They are not exactly CGI movies, but the CGI is FOCUSED in particular scenes.<br />Watching the Avengers, it was just all over the place.<br />And the idea of the hovering aircraft carrier, thats been done so many times it was boring the second i saw it.

				Yeah, i hate it when people hate on the actors.&nbsp; Its hardly their fault. I mean, they can only do so much.<br />And i just realised that the movie was directed by none other than Joss &quot;Firefly&quot; Whedon.<br />Yep, buffy the fucking vampire slayer.<br />Makes sense now.

				The single best thing about the Avengers was what Mark Ruffalo was doing with Bruce Banner/Hulk.&nbsp; I gotta say that I&#039;m juiced as to where that is going.&nbsp; Every other attempt at the Hulk franchise has been shiite.<br /><br />Yes, the flying aircraft carrier pissed me off.&nbsp; But on the upside, the last scene between Hulk and Loki still cracks me up.

				Both dark knight and avengers were overrated, but avengers at least kept me entertained. Dark knight was a predictable snore fest.
