				Just because YOU don&#039;t like it, doesn&#039;t mean it should be banned... I&#039;m sure you do stuff that other people do not like and would be super pissed if someone tried to rain on your parade. <br /><br />If someone is willing to pay for porn for some reason, then they are stupid and don&#039;t deserve money in the first place. <br /><br />I have a lot of respect for people who take something worth nothing and can make money off it. If you&#039;re not smart enough to do it, then too bad :)

				Yeah, I wonder if anyone&#039;s ever bought those listings....&nbsp; But, alas, it doesn&#039;t violate the SR rules since no harm and no CP, so let demand dictate the supply.<br /><br />Unless you want another SR offshoot for porn, like the armory.&nbsp; The Vagory?

				I have no ideologically opposition to the pornography being sold here, nor does it offend me. However...<br /><br />It does annoy the fuck out of me. I come here for drugs! Don&#039;t go taking up a possible front-page listing for something cool with your wack-ass $0.87 link to an X-Tube video! We all know about redtube, we can jerk off just fine. <br /><br />But anyway, the philosophy of this market is no harm and no CP, so I guess we have to live with it... just like the &quot;lottos&quot;.

				It&#039;s funny I was thinking of this exact topic earlier when I was seeing (likely as others were) some front page vagina pics. <br /><br />I&#039;m into porn, and even perused the section after seeing a couple front page listings, but I also have certain times I&#039;m not interested in it at all, and could somewhat prefer it not being in front of my face.<br /><br />That being said, those sellers that may make money off it do still have the right to have their listings on the front page. <br /><br />I&#039;d likely never actually pay for porn, but if you don&#039;t want to see it, it&#039;s really up to you how much energy you spend towards it. If you don&#039;t prefer it, you can dismiss it entirely and get the fuck over it. It&#039;s like if you didn&#039;t prefer nudity in a film you happened to be watching. Or a gruesome scene that you didn&#039;t like while in a theater. It&#039;s like going to someones house who&#039;s watching porn, even though you&#039;ve been really trying to turn off that sort of interest at the time. <br /><br />I used to spend time on the road with a group and at one point we had to decide all together NO PORN on the road! It was too distracting haha. <br /><br />So even if you&#039;re not interested in it, all you have to do is click on your preferred category... such as DRUGS. And be done with it. <br /><br />SOLUTION: Maybe at some point SR will have options for your account to hide certain topics!!!<br /><br />

				Wellll.... yes, we should all be adult enough here to not be grossed out by looking at people pee-pees and bungholes, regardless of marital status.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t see how being engaged or married turns off your ability to enjoy sex, or why anyone over 12 would find the nude human body &quot;gross&quot;)&nbsp; It would be nice if we could customize our homepage a bit though.&nbsp; Maybe say you&#039;d like to see items from specific categories or vendors.<br />There&#039;s a vendor here who sometimes uses a pic he purchased from another vendor for his listings.&nbsp; The pic is of the second vendors girlfriend&#039;s pussy with a sign with the first vendor&#039;s name written on it.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a hilarious joke, and not all that appealing, but I don&#039;t linger too long on the home page anyhow.

				This crap should be banned as almost all of it is available on the clearnet for free and it&#039;s only useful purpose on SR is to inlfate seller feedback like most of the digital goods offerings. No free speech issue, not stepping on anyones right to make cash, just calling out this bullshit for what it is.

I changed my mind.. No porn or insert-able objects.. They removed guns from silkroad because they did not belong... <br /><br /><br />LOL someone who rather masterbate at their desk then spend time with a real woman gave me bad karma :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Okay brother, I gotta say something. First, only you give you bad karma. Do you mean bad vibes or feelings perhaps?<br /><br />And second... not everyone has a real woman on hand to fuck whenever they want. This includes many married men haha. So, props to YOU for having a sweet vagina handy! <br /><br />AND OVERALL, if you have issues in any way about others masturbating, that raises plenty of questions. In my experience EVERY SINGLE sexually sound person I&#039;ve ever known, masturbates. Most males masturbate&nbsp; regardless of whether they&#039;re married, single, dating or in a relationship. (GUYS?!?!?!) This is because there&#039;s sex with self and sex with another. AND sex with others. If you have issues with masturbating, or the idea that sex with self is not proper or isn&#039;t when in a relationship... Sorry buddy. It&#039;s two completely different things. And sort of hints as to why you are having an issue with SR porn listings. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;d have to ask... you have never since masturbated or masturbated to porn since becoming married? Do you consider something like that inappropriate or wrong? <br /><br />I think the consensus here is bfd. Perhaps the issue lies with you brother. <br /><br /><br />For recent posts, I would agree with certain site images having some kind of filter for porns. For those that simply can&#039;t help being affected. But then again... Maybe I&#039;m getting SO PISSED at all the meth chard pictures. Ouch it just so... bothers me. Yknow... METH n shit! Ehhhh???<br /><br />And for the sick son of a bitch who posted the link of clean my ass HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! The real truth is, you fuckin went to the site and copied the link to post. So.... cmon. Really. Get over it. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t resist checking the link, and it fucking made me LAUGH!!!!!! It&#039;s obviously fake.... sauce.... hahahahaha FOR REAL!

Why can&#039;t you just live and let live? Ironic how a few of you saying this are very new. Maybe those who said SR should have gone private after gawker were right. Ban this, ban that.

				You people are all overreacting. There has been porn on SR for over a YEAR! Now. The recent images that have flooded the market (eg the cleanmyass.com listing) were all by one vendor who is new.

				CindyLove has successfully convinced me that this isn&#039;t all that bad. I think the images for these listings MUST be decent so that those of us that don&#039;t want to see this stuff on here don&#039;t have to. That way no one will have a problem with it being on the homepage of the road. So, VENDORS listen up - if you&#039;re selling porn or any of this related adult material change your pictures to something that is not vulgar and will not be taken in a bad way by anyone. If you guys do this no one will complain and nobody will request for ALL the listings to be removed from the homepage all together. You&#039;ll only be doing yourselves a favor by doing this because if you don&#039;t, people will keep going on about it UNTIL something IS done!<br /><br />By the way - I design default product listing images that are VERY attractive, professional and will attract the attention of ANY customer when it&#039;s displayed on the homepage of the road.

				look warweed... we are not talking about &#039;removing&#039; the porn... I LOVE THE PORN! lol<br /><br />As a Vendor AND a Buyer I don&#039;t want 6 pics of porn popping up when I log in... which you know would happen if you posted 10,000 porn listings which I am pretty sure you could do if you wanted...<br /><br />I proposed two pics max of porn on the main page... I don&#039;t think that is unreasonable...<br /><br />the only reason it is an issue (i think) is because MOST of us are here for drugs... not that we hate porn but when you log in to find drugs and your assaulted with six pics of anal rape... well it kind of knocks you off your game... lol<br /><br />Thanks!<br />TJ

				I truly dont understand why people still buy porn with sites like redtube, spankwire, tube8 etc- free porn- spankwire you can even d/l the videos- or using a torrent to get free porn.&nbsp; <br /><br />As long as its not CP i dont really see the issue of people getting their porn here- if people want to pay let em.&nbsp; It rarely is up on the front page anyways.&nbsp; just let it be.&nbsp; Also please are these pictures offending anybody, the pictures on the site arent necessarily Safe For Work shit anyhow- sometimes you just gotta let it be and concentrate on your own shit- if you want drugs, look at the drugssss mannn

				Yah, I know that the sellers don&#039;t pay for the porn they sell, and don&#039;t mind spending a dollar or two for a video collection and not having to hunt for them myself and it adds an element of random surprise to it instead of going to free tube service typing in usual stuff and getting similar results, instead I get fresh material and get an enjoyment out of buying it for some reason. SR is the only place I have purchased porn ever, but I don&#039;t mind because it is entertaining in some weird way.<br /><br />I enjoy the amateur videos and found one that I will cherish for a while. It was totally worth purchasing different links to get this one in my opinion. It really hits the spot for me, and a video like that only comes around so often that I absolutely love through and through. I am very particular.

				Does TPB have decent actual amateur videos, like the real amateur not porn film pretend to be amateur, but really paid videos.<br /><br />That is all I will watch, and it has to be good which presents a problem since most amateur videos suck or are faked to look like amateur, but really not.

				To the OP, there&#039;s the biblical saying that might apply to this situation: &quot;if thy eye offends thee, pluck it out.&quot;<br /><br />So having a blind wife can&#039;t be too bad? right OP?......... since its your wife who is offended?<br /><br /><br />j/k..... lol.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like to quote the bible much (must be the satanist in me, &#039;Hail! Satan!&#039;), but you got to admit that quote can fit, heh.<br />The real message is : try to don&#039;t pay attention to it, rather than try to squash the offending porn images, I think.&nbsp; :::shrugs:::
