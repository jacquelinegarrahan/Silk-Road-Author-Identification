				I get this letter in the mail today...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dear ----------<br /><br />This letter is in response to your recent request to open a Bill Me Later account. Our records show that you requested to open an account or make a purchase using the Bill Me Later payment method on 08/11/13.<br /><br />We regret that we are unable to approve you for the service at this time for the following reason:<br /><br />The amount of your purchase required a credit bureau report. We were unable to retrieve a report from a consumer reporting agency.<br /><br />Our credit decision was based in a whole or in part on information obtained in a report from the consumer-reporting agency listed below. You have a right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to know the information contained in your credit file at the consumer reporting agency. The reporting agency played a no part in our decision and is unable to supply specific reasons why we have denied credit to you.<br /><br />You also have the right to a free copy of your report from the reporting agency if you request no later than 60 days after you receive this notice. In addition, if find that any information contained in the report you receive is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to dispute the matter with the reporting agency.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have never used this service. Is this a scam, or is it possible a vendor used my address to make an account for something like this? Or am I just being schtizo paranoid? The mail looks sketchy, the return address is a P. O. Box...

				I realize now that the address they used shows my &quot;extended zip&quot; or whatever which I never use for anything, not even my bank account. But I wonder how these people got my name and address in the first place?

				Hmm ok I see, I think i might know whats up. My paypal account is linked with a company account that transfers money. Perhaps that has something to do with it. That kind of gives me relief hah, always so paranoid...
