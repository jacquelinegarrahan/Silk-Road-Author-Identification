				I personally know many, many IRL dealers who sell M1 (methylone) as MDMA. They do this either because they don&#039;t even know what they really have but more commonly its because m1 is cheaper and MDMA is more expensive, so to increase your profit margin some choose to break the cardinal rule of drug dealing. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard of any SR vendors trying to do this, at least not lately. But I am curious as to what % of M1 sales on SR later get re-sold as MDMA.

				I read that in 2011 out of all the drugs sold as mdma confiscated by police in Florida 78% tested back as mdma and the other 22% as methylone, then in 2012 89% of drugs being sold as mdma tested back as methylone and the remainder 11% mdma.&nbsp; They said most drugs on the street being sold as molly any more is methylone due to the cost and availability.

				Even the MDMA tested stuff does not mean it&#039;s really MDMA because back when DanceSafe and pillreports.com and the other site used to list the exact percentage of pills off the street (they still list the DEA tested ones) most of the ones that tested for actual MDMA would only have like 10mg MDMA per pill. They would just put some MDMA in it so it could pass the reagent tests and then load up the rest of the pill with caffeine, and BZP, and all this other crap.

				I keep mines as is, and sell it as pure as I get it. People who step on product aren&#039;t cool in my book. I would agree not many people know or care what they sell. I care very much for the people who get to enjoy the great things I work very meticulously to obtain.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />MDMA is one of my best friends&nbsp; 8)<br />
