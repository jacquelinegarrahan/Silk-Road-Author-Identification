				I just read it and yes, it makes me nervous. But, they were uploading and downloading content. Remember Tor gives you a message every time you do that saying that it could give away you identity. Plus proxy servers are not anonymous at all. <br /><br />So, I would like more info as well. How secure are we?

				Not exactly sure but I asked a couple people and they said they don&#039;t think it was a hidden service. Also it says 70 out of 600 got busted. So probably 70 used just VPNs or no anonymity service at all.

				Child Porn is always going to be of a higher priority then people selling personal amts of drugs on the web like SR. Plus the fact that everyone on a site like that is guilty and is a notable bust, where as people buying acouple pills online probably wouldnt be justified in the amount of money and time it would take to bust them. Add the fact that busting acouple people here isnt really going to lead anywhere cause no one knows anything about anyone else besides sellers who have addresses that they should be deleting daily.

				if it were a hidden service, journalists would have gone out of the way to mention SR in the story.<br />Then it becomes a bigger issue to report on.

However, it is a safe bet that the perverts dealing in child smut were the subject of other police inquery.&nbsp; In contrast, SR is on some level open to anyone (buyer or seller) willing to find the site and create a profile. It is also a safe bet that some of the buyer and sellers on SR are cops. With that said, maintain your anonymity and keep SR safe.<br /><br />Dr. Forsetti
