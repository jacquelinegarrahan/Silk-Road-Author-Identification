				I&#039;ve noticed a lot of random people disappearing from the forums lately, and I haven&#039;t even really been here long.<br /><br />Curious if it&#039;s always been like that or if there&#039;s been a recent influx of disappearances.<br /><br />Either or I like your tag cisco.. raise the awareness! Everyone should have one! :P

				Thanks!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been here about 6 months and it seems like people disappearing is a fairly regular thing.<br /><br />I figure they have either had some major change in their life (quit drugs, got busted, died, who knows) or they felt like they had posted too much personal info and need to make a new account.<br /><br />I think there are also some people who have just gotten bored/tired/fed-up with the forums.

				it is unfortunate because due to the anonymous nature of silk road i will never get in contact with him again. he posted a few things that should be preserved for posterity. like on a blog or something.

				The forums did go through a really dark period in November when everyone was slandering DPR and saying SR was compromised. I would understand if a lot of people got upset and left, even I had to take a sizable break just to clear my head of all the drama.
