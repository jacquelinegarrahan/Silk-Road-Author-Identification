				Ok so I am watching this documentary on BBC3 about the police and it&#039;s basically looking at peoples different perspectives on them.&nbsp; I know this is going to be quite a controversial topic but I think it is one worth discussing. I see on here people saying &quot;Fuck the pigs&quot;, &quot;I hate the pigs&quot;, fuck it I do too but what do you ACTUALLY think and WHY? If you hate them then what specifically do you hate about them? Have you had any bad experiences with them or been mistreated by them? Be careful not to give too many details if you care to share.<br /><br />For all those with VPN or in the U.K you should watch this documentary, it&#039;s called - Can We Trust The Police? <br /><br />It&#039;s quite interested to see the corruption that&#039;s discussed about the London Met, only thing worse than a pig is a corrupt pig. <br /><br />Anyway yeah, discuss.

				I think ultimately some police may have good intentions but I have a really hard time understanding how ANYONE would want to be the person that everyone dislikes and if you stop and give someone a ticket you are basically ruining their day.&nbsp; I would venture to say anyone who has ever had a strong psychedelic experience would never, ever become a police officer.&nbsp;

				I think my problem with them personally is strictly regarding drugs and the anti drug stance has corrupted the police system as a whole. Also I think that a lot of 5-O, particularly in London are allowed to abuse their power which compounds the issue. It&#039;s also dangerously politicized in the U.K too.

Cake makes you fat, tanning beds give ya cancer, the list doth continue.<br /><br />Anyway yeah I hate the condescending nature of the police and how they seem to pontificate about things they actually know nothing of. If you watch the YouTube vid with the DEA secretary looking a tit in front of Polis when discussing puff. I think if the police actually protected people instead of persecuting them I wouldn&#039;t be so anti. The problem is that it&#039;s not just victimising drug users in the U.K anymore, they don&#039;t help the people who do need protecting or are in need like the little old lady who gets mugged and all they do is give them an incident number. One of the worst cases of not-giving-a-fuck was this family who were bullied by these chavvy little bastards on their street and they ask them to help so many times, got fuck all and then the woman in question ended up killing herself and her disabled daughter because she couldn&#039;t take it anymore. <br /><br />Protect us? Like fuck do they.

				It&#039;s not an easy question to answer. I am absolutely disgusted with how they are constantly abusing the law as well as the people they have sworn to protect. I understand that they have a job to do, and they are expected to stop you for speeding, especially when you&#039;re putting yourself and/or others in danger, which I can agree with. However, there are always those who will ticket you petty things or try to scare you into self-incrimination. Also, police who think it&#039;s okay to kick, punch, spray, beat, or shoot people using unnecessary force because they know they won&#039;t be reprimanded for it is just beyond evil as fuck. <br /><br />I absolutely love this video of Lawrence O&#039;Donnell destroying the NYPD because of their disgusting acts during the Occupy Wall Street protests.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgr3DiqWYCI<br /><br />sdesu

				I think most cops probably start out as normal people and maybe even have good intentions of protecting people and working with the system to make a better place. Well, I would like to think so anyway.<br />I guess after a while after dealing with drunks all weekend and husbands bashing their wives, they get a bit cynical and just stop giving a fuck.

I feel quite strongly about the subject of our rights and liberty to be honest. Personally I feel that as a human being it&#039;s your right not to be repressed or suppressed by anyone so long as you do nobody harm yourself. We shouldn&#039;t ever bow to anyone because that&#039;s the reserve of the weak minded. Nobody and especially nobody here should give up their right to defend themselves or think for themselves ever. It&#039;s your duty to yourself to fight back with whatever you have at your disposal and doo whatever it takes to be free.

				Here the police are professional and will not harass you (at least, as long as you aren&#039;t sketchy as fuck). I&#039;ve had dealings with them and they are nice people in general. We have a gang/delinquent problem, so I&#039;d much rather deal with police than those little dickheads. I have friends who have family in the police, and they are nice almost to a fault.<br /><br />All in all, I don&#039;t feel oppressed. We had a riot near here a year ago though, so maybe it&#039;s just my friendly neighbourhood spiderpigs, and the ones elsewhere are normal pigs.

				Police have power. Power is an addictive drug, that police will chase and quench their addiction.<br /><br />It&#039;s very dangerous. Of course, some cops are reasonable, but some are just downright out to get ya. They love the chase. They love their power.

				They&#039;re just another influential gang. When the cops come, you know you&#039;re fucked. It&#039;s violence v. violence. Bigger guy with the bigger gun wins. That&#039;s the way it is, human nature, natural selection and all that. They&#039;re bigger, stronger, and more organized than you are, so they win every time, regardless of whether what they&#039;re doing is morally questionable. That&#039;s the downside to getting instant protection from rape/murder/burglary at the drop of a line. It&#039;s simple as that.

				what does it mean to &quot;police&quot; someone?<br /><br />i feel like the definition of the verb holds the great answer to all the questions anyone would ever have about the popo.<br /><br />to impose your opinions, wishes, wants, rules, etc on someone else and usually that means by force.<br /><br />gee, how swell. we should just install cameras in every crevice of our lives to make these hardworking people&#039;s jobs easier.<br /><br />really though - the shit that happens in first world countries (police/etc wise) is such a farce that people in third world countries don&#039;t know if they should laugh about how asinine this shit is or if they should cry that they&#039;re striving to attain the same social levels...<br /><br />really though - insider trading and other SEC white collar crimes? fistfights between friends, deemed assault? all this frivolous shit is just laughable and a sorry asswipe excuse for all the real criminals who skim through the kangaroo court system with the slick ease of a greased up rubber dildo.

				i&#039;ve got nothing against the police, but i don&#039;t agree with certain laws they have to uphold. <br /><br />i actually work quite closely with them from time to time and it&#039;s generally the rookies that are wankers, just wanting to bust everyone to get their extra star or whatever it is. the established plod, the ones who are quite a way up the ladder are generally good guys. yes you do get the occasional holier-than-thou arse bandit, but on the whole detectives and chiefs are ok. you can spot them a mile off when in plain-clothes, they just carry themselves differently to normal folk and have this air about them.<br /><br />on the occasional run-in i&#039;ve had with them outside work, which hasn&#039;t been many - drunk and disorderly, assault with a &#039;deadly weapon&#039; (fucking 22 air rifle!) and whatnot they&#039;ve always been polite and respectful so i have been polite and respectful in return. i&#039;ve never had any reason to kick off at them, and to be honest i never saw the point in why people that did that - what can you possibly gain from being an awkward fucker?<br /><br />when i sold coke the only thought i had on them was &#039;respect thine enemy&#039;. i didn&#039;t get sloppy and never got pinched for drugs.<br /><br />bottom line is everyone has a job to do, but i wouldn&#039;t want to do theirs.

				I have never had a &#039;good&#039; experience with the police. I was at the London student riots back in 2011, (no i didn&#039;t smash or violently abuse anyone, i was peaceful, like the majority of people were) and the police made everything worse. They stood around watching everyone smash windows, throw fire extinguishers and throw bangers, they didnt do shit! other than violently push the innocent, peaceful protestors around. <br />I also hate the way 95% of them abuse their power, thinking they&#039;re a boss of everyone. I also hate the way they enforce drug laws, especially when we are doing NO harm to anyone else but ourselves when we take them and all we want is a good time, and they just think its acceptable to come and stop our fun. They need to concentrate on real crimes, such a murder, rape and terrorism.

				As with all walks of life there are good cops, indifferent cops, and bad cops. I&#039;ve met all kinds. Most seemed like bad cops whenever I was getting arrested though. <br /><br />Corruption is something I hate on a whole different level and believe shouldn&#039;t be held against &quot;police&quot; as it is usually just some fucktard(s) pursuing power/cash. <br /><br />For the larger picture...<br /><br />Sadly, I believe the police are necessary else my neighbor would have stolen my computer by now, or worse. I also disagree with some of their laws, particularly ones telling me what I can do with myself behind closed doors. I can understand the safety concern with irresponsible use of drugs, but what really gets me is the lack of initiative to educate people to be responsible. Grouping a variety of substances with a wide array of effects and saying, &quot;those are drugs. drugs are bad. X, Y, Z happens when you take drugs&quot; has always been ridiculous and promotes nothing but ignorance for the reality of the situation. Anytime I&#039;m at work (or a similar environment) and hear someone speaking about &quot;drugs&quot; I want to either burst with laughter or educate them on the facts... but the kicker is that many just *gasp* that I know such things. Seems I drifted off-topic.<br /><br />All in all I wish I could roam free of police, but honestly I do most of the time as it is. The only real impact I can see them having on my life currently is some paranoia (hopefully nothing more) when ordering and a biting of the tongue in certain environments. I just wish we could get those non-violent drug offenders out of the institutions!

				Haha yeah certainly is man. When I said &quot;Constructive&quot; I just wanted to here proper opinions and thoughts rather than just &quot;All pigs are cunts&quot; or something like that.

				My feelings are exactly what Limitless said towards the start of this topic.&nbsp; My feelings towards the police aren&#039;t good due to the corruption the war on drugs has caused among them.&nbsp; Now, the police aren&#039;t hired to PROTECT CITIZENS, but instead are here to punish anyone they can, and to &quot;meet their quota,&quot; which is complete bullshit for them to even have a quota to meet to begin with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve dealt with my fair share of officers, and I&#039;ve met some that are pretty cool and lenient when it comes to pot (I&#039;ve had multiple officers just confiscate my shit and not arrest me or ticket me), and I&#039;ve had officers that are just straight douche bags that just try to punish any stoner they see for being a stoner.&nbsp; Right now, I don&#039;t have any respect for most of the officers, especially the ones heavily enforcing the current drug laws right now.&nbsp; But, there are some cool ones out there that are very much against the war on drugs, it&#039;s just they are stuck enforcing some of those laws along with the other laws that protect us.<br /><br />The officers in my area are dicks, tho.&nbsp; They know I&#039;m a stoner, to say the least.&nbsp; And they judge me by that.&nbsp; For example, when my car got broken into and I filed a report, it took them 3 hours to get to my house when the police station is literally 2 blocks away, and they didn&#039;t do anything about it even thou I had camera footage on who did it!&nbsp; And my business I own uptown was vandalized by a homeless guy who EVERYONE KNEW and was on camera and they laughed at me and said &quot;Yeah, good luck with that&quot;.&nbsp; So, yeah, I have no respect for cops right now.&nbsp; But when I go and beat the fuck out of the homeless guy, police show up INSTANTLY and charge me with everything they can.&nbsp; It&#039;s fucking bullshit

				A necessary &#039;evil&#039; on many regards. Sad we need a police force as many people are good and can live in harmony with others. It is the small minority of really bad people that make the police a &#039;must have&#039; in any civilized nation.<br /><br />As for drugs. This is an issue with many of us obviously. If using drugs makes you a criminal this accounts for a massive number of people being opposed to the police. Corruption is widespread but only in nations were cops are killed by gangs and underpaid. Cops in the USA/old EU and UK are paid well and gangs will NOT kill cops. A few exceptions exist but for the main nobody wants to kill a cop.<br /><br />Good cops are good people. Cops see the bad side of drugs not the good. They see the worse of the drug scene and obviously see drugs cut with all manner of rubbish as they can buy and also send for tests which is obligatory if they are to prosecute. They see the nastiness but many young cops are for legalisation as they grew up around drugs and know that they would do more good IF they could patrol places and know people. If drugs were legal this would take away a lot of disrespect for cops. <br /><br />But if your child goes missing, you call them, right?<br /><br />If your car is stolen, house burgled. You call the cops to claim insurance which demands a crime reference number.<br /><br />Cops in the child porn departments do a good job also. A job many here would not be able to do.<br /><br />The drug world is full of very violent people and sometimes that violence is far worse than anything cops can do to you. <br /><br />So, for me at least, I&#039;d sooner have a police force than not. As for drugs being illegal, most cops in the UK know someone who uses drugs. This generation of cops might well speak out at some point as regards drug laws. We have some pioneering cops who do see the sense in making drugs legal and taxing them. They will need support when they do speak out. <br /><br />As for all cops being bad, you know that is not true.<br /><br />Admittedly cops may do things which hurt others. but if your selling a shit load of coke and whatever you kind of accept the rules of the game. Most prisoners do not cry about the cops who caught them. <br /><br />And I once dated a cop women. Well, she was on a fancy dress night out. I said I would take down her particulars. (the old line) and wish the missus would do me like a cop women - dressed up - handcuffed, the whole shebang.<br /><br />Its the skirt, the tights, the hat, the whole thing. She would pretend to call at the house. I ask her to come in. She handcuffs me and I get fucked by the law and come out smiling and smoking a joint.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />So, sorry to any cop women out there. But its all harmless fun.<br /><br />Even funny when the cop women does a line of coke and nails you to the bed.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Getting excited here.<br /><br />Best go and get a cold shower.

I did though :)<br />Problem is me and 2 of my friends couldn&#039;t help ourselves me and 1 friend had 800mg over 10 hours and the other had 400mg.<br />Last 200/300mg did nothing to me. Left me and the other 800mg lad etarded for a good 4 days though. Never again!<br /><br />Thanks for the loan mr.police man..

				Also I think we should be blaming how the police are trained.. Surly they were all your average person at one point in time got lured into the good prospects of the job then came out a wanker.<br />If the government actually made good laws and enforced officers correctly and with a good nature then we&#039;d treat them like heroes taking the peados and wankers down while letting us take our shit and enjoy life in bliss.<br /><br />One thing I hate about them, from living in the UK. The rave scene was coming on pretty strong from where I live and literally thousands of kids from around me where coming together and having fun in abandoned warehouses etc. Yeah there were a few underage drinkers and a few idiots and many drugs to be had but I never once seen a fight, we were all just happy to be a part of something. Problem is police remained a massive problem even we used private land or had licenses etc. <br /><br />Also if you think you can lie to me to try and bend the law you better be fucking sure I&#039;m going to do it straight back.<br />Also it pisses me off that if you get interviewed by a police officer anything you say can only be used to incriminate you and not used at your defense.&nbsp; FUCK THAT

				I&#039;ll quote from the master.<br /><br />&quot;the pest is always full of dry standard nonsense that he mistakes for self-wisdom. some of his favorite remarks are:<br />&#039;there is no such thing as ALL bad. you say that all cops are bad. well they&#039;re not. I&#039;ve met some good ones. there is such thing as a good cop.&#039;<br />you never get a chance to explain to him that when a man puts that uniform on that he is the paid protector of things of the present time. he is here to see that things stay the way they are. if you like the way things are, then all cops are good cops. if you don&#039;t like the way things are, then all cops are bad cops. <br /><br />Notes on the Pest by Charles Bukowski. <br /><br />All cops are bad cops. Fuck em. <br /><br />Limit, if you&#039;d like to have a perspective on American police then I recommend this video. It illustrates the rampant police brutality and the sinister brotherhood within the department that simply does not allow for the prosecution of officers at fault. It is like the mafia. The code of silence.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVmGWLsn0iM<br /><br />Be careful, this video will disgust you.

I did enjoy it, especially the part where the cool city kid has to walk around a farm in Scotland, make me laugh looking at his perfectly white trainers and all that mud. <br /><br />The best way to deal with cops in the UK is to get yourself on the law register (just sign up for a cheap 2 week paralegal course in almost any college, you don&#039;t even need to turn up!! and just costs a few pounds), then they&#039;ll treat you very very very differently. You don&#039;t even need to tell them you&#039;re a lawyer or anything legal, when they start talking to you and ask &quot;is there anything we should know?&quot; just drop in that your on the law register and watch them get back in their cars and drive away. <br /><br />This won&#039;t work if you have 10kg of Coke on your back seat, but for most other circumstances works a treat. Don&#039;t be worried if they phone HQ to check you&#039;re actually on the register, sometimes they do this, but only takes a few seconds. The beauty is the register doesn&#039;t actually say WHAT you do, it just says &quot;law society approved&quot; which means you could be a trainee lawyer in college, secretary in a law firm, solicitor, barrister or Judge. Also they aren&#039;t allowed to ask what you are as it beaches the polices impartiality rules.<br /><br />This only applies to the UK I&#039;m afraid. No experience with US police.

				One of the times i was stopped by the police i was smoking a blunt with some friends and&nbsp; a police van comes around and the driver knows we&#039;re smoking but all he does is have a joke with us and asks if we have any fireworks on us he finds no fireworks(it was bonfire night) so he goes on his way laughing, but that was the only positive time. The other 10 times I&#039;ve been stopped they acted like pricks on a ego-trip and the thing is i wasn&#039;t doing anything bad&nbsp; :-\
