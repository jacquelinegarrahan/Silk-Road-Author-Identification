				You will go on Youtube and watch the following two videos:<br /><br />Science Saved My Soul: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6w2M50_Xdk<br /><br />The Music Scene by Blockhead: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBdmnu9YJsQ&amp;feature=fvst<br /><br />Those videos will blow your mind, one in terms of the universe and thought, and one in terms of visuals. So you&#039;re getting the best of both worlds. For music, I suggest Florence and the Machine for something a little less mainstream. I mean Pink Floyd is great and all, but it&#039;s probably a bit overdone. I also enjoy Red Hot Chili Peppers. Have a great trip&nbsp; :D

				Okay here&#039;s a ten minute movie with a reading by Tim Minchin that I&#039;ve always appreciated while tripping: EDIT - LINK POSTED BELOW<br /><br />If you&#039;re some sort of artist, don&#039;t forget to try drawing or painting something! And of course take a tour of your own house. Like spend a good half hour just looking at your own rooms, you&#039;ll be amazed how fresh and new they look. And for the love of God at least look out the windows if you don&#039;t go out! The sky is even more beautiful than you could have imagined right now. And the grass, and the trees, and everything.

				Holy shit Duffman, that Alice in Wonderland video is (no pun intended) wonderful. I&#039;ll be tripping and will definitely be putting that on.<br /><br />May I suggest combining it with this song for an awesome experience: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAwR6w2TgxY

				I can&#039;t handle technology when I&#039;m tripping.&nbsp; It&#039;s a totally different level.&nbsp; The faces morphing sometimes become too much for me.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather be outdoors, enjoying Mother Nature, frolicking in a creek, and cackling like a madman.

				Damn straight Tagore. My best trips have been just going for a walk. The other night 3 friends and I saw a water tower waaaay out on the horizon and decided to walk there. The journey was amazing, walking through the woods, encountering people, walking through unknown territory at night under the full moon. Simply beautiful.
