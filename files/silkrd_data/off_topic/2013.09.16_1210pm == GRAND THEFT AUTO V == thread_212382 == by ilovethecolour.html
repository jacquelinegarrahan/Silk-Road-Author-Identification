I haven&#039;t needed to upgrade since i built this rig quite a few years ago, as all I played was CSS. But I&#039;m gonna look into upgrading it slowly I reckon, and see that price list has made me want to upgrade even more aha.

You get them alot cheaper and are 99% of the time alot more powerful than pre-builds bought. Pre-built computers tend to focus on storage space and ram, and if you got what you were thinking of, it is likely to have an integrated card&nbsp; ::).<br /><br />If you wanted sometime just let me know and I could build you one on pc part picker, fairly easy to build and took me about 3 hours my first time.<br />And yes, I had some inheritence money that I was given, and instead of a holiday that would only last a few weeks why not get that. ;D<br />~D

This is the main reason that you NEVER go with pre-built computers, they seem to focus on Ram and Storage space, because that&#039;s what people who don&#039;t know about computers want. &quot;I&#039;ve just got a new computer, It&#039;s got 16GB of RAM AND A 2TB HARD DRIVE!!!! But it has an intel integrated card...&quot;. Haha, of course ram and storage space matters, but anything over 8gb ram is easily enough, and 2tb is just excessive...<br /><br />Custom builds are the way to go! Â£400 and a bit of knowledge you can build something capable of running all of the next gen games ;D<br />Anyone want a PcPartPicker let me know ::)<br />~D

Say you got an i7, 16gb ram, a 2tb hard drive (which you are unlikely to even need honestly), but then a shitty graphics card. If you lowered the other specs and got a high end gpu, you will probably have more than twice the gaming PC.<br /><br />It&#039;s just making sure you make the most of the money you have and get it alot cheaper, but if you have plenty to spare then go ahead&nbsp; ::)<br />Plus, building a PC is nearly as good as receiving drugs in the post ;D<br />~D
