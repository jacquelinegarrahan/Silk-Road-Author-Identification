				I heard Tormail had loads of problems, always going offline and shit.<br />Can anyone suggest any other encrypted mail providers???<br /><br />Oh by the way, i dont see why anyone should pay for a fucking premium service on Safe-mail when most emails are fucking free.

				heyif it was at least as secure as tormail, ran hidden only with no scripts&nbsp; and gaurinteed not to narc with built in mix net services accepting BTC&nbsp; i guess many would pay in BTC.<br /><br />but its not secure and uses s/mime and co operates with the feds.

				Hi Adasel,<br /><br />Tormail is the best &#039;encrypted&#039; email provider you can get; hence the reason it is the number one email provider of vendors and security conscious folks here. However, regardless of which email provider you use, ALWAYS encrypt your messages as well as you never know who is looking at the records despite what the provider may claim about not working with police etc. It does occasionally go offline but this is rarely ever for more than a couple of hours at most.<br /><br />Here is the Tormail .onion address: http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/<br /><br />I just logged in with no problems so perhaps try using a new identity.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				thers numerous weird bugs in the interface and with tor+&nbsp; secure browser noscript precautions <br />that even if you get the password right - it will deny you access superficialy-<br />it lead me to &quot;losing&quot; my &quot;isk&quot; nym on tormail. [weekly complex password changes means ino longer what the last good&nbsp; passord was at that time ]&nbsp; :(#<br /><br /><br />so i recomemnd you keep trying - it probably will let you in.

				Hi guys. <br />Sorry for the late response, but im still having a major headache with Tormail.&nbsp; Please dont get me wrong, i am not that technically stupid. I tried three different times, waited 5 minutes on each and it STILL says either my password or login is wrong.<br />Please, please please, is there another service i cannot use??<br />Generally i would have given up at attempt number one but this website is the only one i can think of, in my 20 plus years of using the internet, that gave me this much trouble.
