				Yo psytrip. Negative karma just indicates that you arnt censoring yourself dude - if you only want good feedback then you better practice your asslicking !<br />Remember this is a drugs forum dude - the moment you start taking any of this seriously is the time to take one of those little red reality check pills.<br />

It doesn&#039;t. In fact, you should be against it.
