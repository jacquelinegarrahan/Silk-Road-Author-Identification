				Like seriously... I´ve had limited experience with severe mental health issues.. My ex was bi polar but I was never really sure if she knew that she was acting weird during her breaks.. How do crazy people know they´re crazy. Do they see them selves as being the odd ones, or do they think that the rest of the world has gone sideways around them.. Were all a little crazy I get that, I´ve had my fair share of people properly breaking down and going nuts. But I´m talking here actual real psychosis... Some background, for some reason I always attract people with issues. I met a girl the other night in a club, went for a walk and started chatting, there was things she was saying that were out of place, she just had this general ambiance of nuttyness, every time I´ve met her since it´s/she´s just been totally crazy. It just got me thinking about the question of weather she thinks shes acting normal, whatever normal is, or I dunno, ma by it varies. Maby I´m the crazy one and she thinks the same about me.. Anyone with mental health issues care to share?

				25% of people will have some mental health issue at some point in their lifetime. There&#039;s a lot of loonies knocking around, and at some point it could well be you.<br /><br />But I think everyone feels they&#039;re a *little* crazy, simply because life is subjective. So I wouldn&#039;t worry about that. If you can hold down friendships, don&#039;t get into much drama, and are liked by your friends, chances are you&#039;re alright.<br /><br />Also: Everyone thinks they attract &#039;crazy&#039; people, simply because there are so many about, and it&#039;s often only really you really get to &#039;know&#039; someone that you realize they&#039;re kooky.

We went to the beach and we were having some really deep conversation until she started licking a starfish that was washed up.. &quot; to see what it tasted like&quot;

				I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder when I was a teenager..&nbsp; And I don&#039;t think I am too crazy, I just think other folks are too outgoing and generally less intelligent than myself.<br /><br />I know deep down that not everyone is a fuckin idiot, and that people aren&#039;t really staring at me,&nbsp; but they are most likely talking shit behind my back.&nbsp; I understand the symptoms, because I have done alot of reading, but compared to others I have seen, I think I have my shit pretty under control.<br /><br />Can&#039;t speak for others though..&nbsp; I have also run into some crazy chicks in my life and have wondered if they know, or are able to comprehend just how fuckin bat shit crazy they really are!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Not exactly fitting here but...<br /><br />I once worked in a sheltered workshop.<br /><br />There was this guy who suffered from an drug induced schizoaffective disorder ( or something this way, hard to translate into english ) after some years of heavy drug abuse and some really shitty things happening in his late teen years.<br /><br />After years working in this sheltered workshop fully integrated he suddenly had a moment of absolute clearness in which he suddenly got aware of the fact that he was working in an sheltered workshop, only handicapped people around him and himself being one of them for years without knowing why the fuck he was there.<br /><br />I will never forget his fear distorted face when he came to me in this moment and asked me why there are so many handicapped people here and if he is one of them. <br /><br />Never felt so hard to say, yes you are, ever again and seeing the fear in his eyes after that.<br /><br />The moment of clearness didn&#039;t last long for this poor soul though and after that he never had one moment like this again.<br /><br /><br /><br />
