				Anyone seen this? I just saw the video that the attackers made justifying it and it was fucking retarded. Clearly just two angry young men using Islam to justify violence. <br /><br />My thoughts are with the family of the victim.

				Holy fuck! Thanks for posting this - I cant believe I hadn&#039;t seen already. <br /><br />This is absolutely disgusting. Somehow even mass terrorism acts make more sense - I can see how a brainwashed person could feel detached enough to commit that sort of public act. But this? This is fucking personal. How can one human being do this to a stranger in the name of ANYTHING. <br /><br />I feel really sorry for the majority of muslim people. Good honest people who will yet again be judged on the actions of a few bad eggs, and forced to feel even further disconnected from mainstream society. Its a vicious circle in my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />

After they did it they stood there and waited for the police with their weapons and possibly a firearm when they were shot by armed response and now they are in hospital. <br /><br />What saddens me with this is that from the way the attacker presented himself he is quite clearly the &quot;Angry Young Man&quot; terrorist, by that, he is quite obviously someone who has had a shit upbringing and possibly been in-and-out of the care/prison system that has been fed bullshit by extremist sources/clerics which they have the anger to channel into. Guaranteed that as this plays out you will find that once the attackers backgrounds the above is exactly what they will find.

				Not London. Not a terrorist attack. It was murder. I know the news said it was, but they&#039;re scare mongers, don&#039;t get caught up in that. The attackers had a motive, it was loosely based on religious beliefs, but one pre meditated murder isn&#039;t a terrorist attack.

				Typical...there&#039;s a knife wielding lunatic with blood on his hands near a body laying in the middle of a street next to a crashed car with what appears to be blood under it, scores of people stood looking on the scene.

				So what qualifies? Is rape a terror attack? According to the text books, rape is a crime of anger and power. Are hate crimes terrorist attacks? If some drunk white lad on a night out kicks in the window of an Indian restaurant? It was a murder. Don&#039;t let the scare monger press turn it into a terrorist attack, do you want another reason to fuel hatred of Muslims, or give another war monger arse hole president of USA fuel to invade another country rich in mineral wealth? It was a murder. It was committed by a fucked up individual/small group. Lets keep some sense of perspective, please. Right Woolwich. I&#039;m sure Londoners agree with you.

				Its a different kind of terror attack, they probably done it this way to gain attention not based around bombs.

				&quot;The day Baghdad style violence came to south London.&quot;&nbsp; :o Give me a break. <br />http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-05-22/exclusive-video-man-with-bloodied-hands-speaks-at-woolwich-scene/ <br /><br />I kind of think people are trying too hard to make all media into one global conspiracy or something. If it wasn&#039;t for them, we wouldn&#039;t even have the video to watch what happened. I mean they say some weird shit and everything but just take it with a grain of (or maybe several grains of) salt. Obviously, not all people are taking the media with a grain of salt which, I believe, is a problem.
