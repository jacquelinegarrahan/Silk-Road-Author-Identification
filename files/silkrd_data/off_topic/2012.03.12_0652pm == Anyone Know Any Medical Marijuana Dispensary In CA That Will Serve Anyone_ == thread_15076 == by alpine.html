				I have heard of MM Dispensaries that will serve people without a card on the down low. Just wondering if anyone knows of any preferably in and around the Palm Springs / San Diego area.<br /><br />Thanks, Alpine

				I don&#039;t have much knowledge of the industry but I do know there are MMJ card forgers out there.&nbsp; OR, you could just go to a dispensary and get a recommendation from the in-house doc like everyone else.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Damn Alpine spend the $40 and get a legal cannabis card. If you are going to a club might as well get a card. If you are not California resident or don&#039;t have an ID then you are kinda screwed anyways. Maybe if you have a California ID.<br /><br /><br />Good Luck.

				If there was, posting about it here would be a stupid idea.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a california ID would buying one of the forgeries on SR not be the solution?<br /><br />&nbsp;I got the impression from Louis Theroux&#039;s docu on MM that it&#039;s fairly easy to get prescribed MM in california.

				thanks for all the replies. i know its painfully easy to get a card but being from out of state it would mean getting a fake id and hope for the best or a fake mmj card which i dont know if that will work because of ids numbers on the card. i also hear that they sometimes call the number on the card to confirm you are in the system so not sure if it would work.

				From what I know all dispensaries have a check-in process for first-time (to their dispensary) patients. They check your valid State ID and your doctor&#039;s Recommendation is verified online or by telephone. You will not be allowed in until the verification is complete.<br /><br />However, you&#039;re in California so chances are you can find it on the streets. Walk to a nearby park or college campus.
