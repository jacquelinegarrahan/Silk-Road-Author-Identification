				usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/20/12850048-at-least-10-killed-after-shooting-during-dark-knight-screening-in-colorado?lite<br /><br />So a couple of hours ago some fucking lunatic shot up a movie theater during a Dark Knight Rises premiere and killed at least ten people. <br /><br />People are already making smart-ass &quot;Hurr-durr this is why guns should be illegal!!!111&quot; comments in every damn direction. <br /><br />Why are people so fucking mindless? How hard is it to comprehend that lunatics and criminals are going to get guns regardless of what the government does? Now we are going to be one step closer to a full-on police state, and the retards are all going to clap and cheer.

				Guns are illegal and very tightly controlled here in the UK and there have been a couple of these gun rampages in the last few years. If a crazy guy wants a gun he will get one. A lot of worst scumbags where I live have guns, we cant defend ourselves with pepper spray or&nbsp; tasers, but we can buy a can of colourful spray goo that sticks to their faces a little bit giving you a chance to run away so they can burgle your house in peace, now thats self defense!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31648.msg358263#msg358263">Quote from: Gary Oak on July 20, 2012, 10:37 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Whoever it was, they&#039;re a bit more impressive than what I usually do.

				Eh America isn&#039;t going to get rid of the guns anytime soon. Just try to restrict their usage more severely, if anything. I really can&#039;t see the 2nd amendment being tossed anytime in the near future.... But I don&#039;t doubt the possibility. Our end of the timeline has seen immense change in such a short period of time.<br /><br />Also, some news agency reported that a 3 month old baby was shot during this tragedy. What rude fucking cunt brings a 3 mo old to a midnight premiere? I probably would have gone on a rampage too if someone&#039;s god damn baby started crying during a suspenseful part.

You don&#039;t seem to have enough faith in the NRA, even though you should. They&#039;ve been very effective in the last 20 years, deploying a wide variety of black arts, in keeping gun control legislation from ever being considered in Washington. When you think of lobbying might, the NRA does come to&nbsp; mind. Plus there&#039;s a conservative supreme court to back them up.<br /><br />Never gonna happen dude.

There&#039;s a reason for that. <br /><br />Only Bloomberg and who gives a fuck what he thinks. <br /><br />Hm ... so where&#039;d you come up with that idea Rush?&nbsp;

Maybe hands should never have been invented, but then how would we pick up groceries at the market? Just like if guns had never be invented there&#039;d be no way to keep control of the clay pigeon population.

You don&#039;t seem to have enough faith in the NRA, even though you should. They&#039;ve been very effective in the last 20 years, deploying a wide variety of black arts, in keeping gun control legislation from ever being considered in Washington. When you think of lobbying might, the NRA does come to&nbsp; mind. Plus there&#039;s a conservative supreme court to back them up.<br /><br />Never gonna happen dude.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You might be right. I dunno it&#039;s just whenever something like this happens my whole shit gets invaded by a cacophony of retards who&#039;s usual pass for an intelligent thought is which contestant on &quot;American Idol&quot; is going to be a Hollywood slut suddenly having political opinions. It really gets my jimmies in a twist. <br /><br /><br />I wish that when people come down with a case of verbal diarrhea and need to start talking their ego-inflating fake empathy they could at least leave their baseless political &quot;ideas&quot; (Read: Liberal news channel parroting) out of it.
