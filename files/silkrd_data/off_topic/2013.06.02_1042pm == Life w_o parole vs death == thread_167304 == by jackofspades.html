				Lets say you had the choice.<br /><br />Life behind bars with no possibility of parole/appeal anything like that.<br /><br />I personally think id chose death. <br /><br />Hopefully none of us will ever be facing the former but im sure theres pros and cons to both.<br />What do ya guys think.

				In reality, I&#039;d go for death.<br />But in my mind, I would go for life, spend 5 years planning an escape and then disappear forever! And then, if they caught me again, I would go for death...

				Death, I suppose, but only because it would be so difficult to have to kill myself when I&#039;d had enough.&nbsp; In the U.S. capital punishment is not the most pleasant way to go out... though neither is hanging by a cheap shoe lace, really.

				I would go with life and then spend my time plotting ways to escape so that I could strap on a suicide vest and run into the DEA headquarters and give them death sentences.

				I don&#039;t know. It would depend if I could spend most of my time in my cell, and what I could do in there. Could I read books? Was the food ok? Could I get extra food? Could I have a TV or Playstation?<br /><br />It would also depend on how much I was exposed to other prisoners and how paranoid I was about being attacked / raped/ shanked. Also depend on how the guards were...<br /><br />With a bit to keep me occupied and some half decent food, I could be convinced to stay alive in the cell.<br /><br />But if all the prisoners were trying to attack me, I couldn&#039;t stay in my cell, I was celled up with others etc.. I&#039;d prefer death

				It really depends on which country the sentence is to be served in. Some countries like Norway have hotel-standard prisons with libraries etc, but if I would have to serve in some shit prison in Congo or something I&#039;d probably want to kill myself.

				Lol @ the people talking about trying to escape.&nbsp; You would regret that choice and be able to ecscape.&nbsp; After your first attempt you would be on close security level as long as they don&#039;t shoot you.

				That&#039;s a tough one. Getting strapped to the gurney while they pump you full of sodium pentathol seems like a really undignified way to die. i think I would choose life, only because waiting around on death row for your execution seems so much worse than actually being dead. But then again, I&#039;ve only spent all of 1 day in jail, so I wouldn&#039;t really know about how bad life in prison could be.

				This all really depends on the amount of raping and molesting that I would have to experience.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to sit in my mind thinking and creating ideas.&nbsp; Too happy really, ha!&nbsp; Need to act more....

				Life without parole.&nbsp; You can&#039;t lock up the mind, it is always free!&nbsp; I remember a quote from Malcolm X about his time in prison.&nbsp; He said he was more free than he had ever been while incarcerated, because he did nothing but read and study!
