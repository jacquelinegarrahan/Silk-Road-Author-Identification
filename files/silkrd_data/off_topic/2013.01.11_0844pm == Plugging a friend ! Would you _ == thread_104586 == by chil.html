				&nbsp;:)<br /><br />So, I was considering to start plugging MDMA, and was wondering if I would help my drug friend doing it, if she wanted to. <br />On my side, I would have no problem being plugged by her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and if any of you has some stories about plugging, I guess this could be the time and place.

				there is alot of neg karma concerned with plugging stuff. esp from big burly men like Lim, Hairy chested Alphas&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />but if you do your reading, you&#039;l find mixed reports. if you suffer from nausea from certain things then it can be avoided this way.

				Yeah I think the trick is though that as a straight guy I&#039;m more comfortable being around naked girls than naked boys. So if it was a girlfriend not an issue at all and if it was a guy friend I would be more inclined to advice or have my girlfriend lend a hand. It&#039;s not overtly sexual but it is fairly intimate. Sadly, while I can get over the &quot;gayness&quot; of plugging drugs, I am still stigmatized by a lifelong indoctrination of how bad it is for naked boys to touch one another. <br /><br />I feel sort of like a crusader for plugging on these forums mostly because I think it&#039;s odd that we all defy social standards to chase a high but still embrace the rights and wrongs of the people who told us drugs were bad in the first place. Oddly for me, plugging seems less &quot;dirty&quot; than IV drug usage and I suspect that&#039;s just because I have tried plugging but only have anti-drug propaganda as a resource upon which to base my opinions of IV use. <br /><br />For most stuff that is orally active though plugging is normally a viable ROA and like smoking gives a different high than snorting, some people might enjoy the high from plugging once they do give it a try. I think the best advice would be to give it a go alone with a drug you are already comfortable with and see if it works well for you.

				I was just researching this bc i have such a sensitive stonach. I&#039;m actually planning on plugging the rest of my MDA tomorrow night. I&#039;m going to mix 130mg w/ 8ml water and use a syringe. I think I can do it myself...<br /><br />I would be happy to plug any of my friends, male or female. In fact I&#039;ll be suggesting it since you absorb 20-30% more drug rectally than orally.

You might want to start at 100mg if you are using ILF&#039;s MDA. I&#039;m a big boy and normally do 200mg plus of MDMA to get going but I more than a little got going on 100-120mg of ILF MDA. The thing with plugging is it gets in a little faster so even if you dosed a little low it&#039;s easy to catch up, especially since MDA stays active so much longer than MDMA.<br /><br />Last bit of advice, since this sounds like you&#039;re last bit of MDA you are going to be playing with... plug just water once to get a feel for it. First time I plugged my GF I was scared of hurting her, didn&#039;t go in far enough, and basically squirted water all over her ass but at least we had some spare X to play with.

				I used to assume that you just plugged a cap with the contents being a drug you wanted to ingest, I&#039;m assuming now that a person would actually have to use a solution of water with the solute being the drugs?<br /><br />How much water is used? wouldn&#039;t it come leaking back out? or does the large intestine really absorb water that quickly?<br /><br />Sorry for the questions, I&#039;m honestly curious as I&#039;ve never tried it myself but i figure it&#039;d be an economic ROA.

				Crap might smell horrid, but that&#039;s only because were programmed to detect chemicals in feces like Skatole, so that we can avoid possible bacterial contamination<br />in the same way that some mice are frightened of the smell of cat piss.<br /><br />Once you get over that and tell yourself it&#039;s only a hole to &#039;spent&#039; food wastage, you can get on and enjoy the best and quickest drug ROA. You can keep to liquids the day your going to plug, like gatorade, etc if you&#039;re so worried about the &quot;dirtiness&quot; (Think about it, &quot;dirt&quot;, you cant avoid the stuff in every day life, especially if you&#039;ve eatean root herbs, potato&#039;s, parsnips, carrots etc. dirt is essentially bug waste. we are the same as bugs, same DNA, mostly Oxygen breathing, made from the same earth elements, etc. but with seemingly higher intelligence.)<br /><br />I&#039;ve not actually done it myself though..

				I was trying to figure out what plugging is. I thought it was for smuggling purposes (wouldn’t work today in Customs) but more likely other interpretation. I never thought of it. Yes I would be prepared to do it if it was a she not a he, yeah it’s a sex thing, it makes a difference who it is. But are you talking about me plugging her or her plugging me? Hmm. I think with anal speed of entry makes all the difference. If you phuc it ^ you probably won’t get a second chance to do this with her a second time.<br /><br />So the OP q.? Would I? Depends what you mean. (See above.) Me her yes, her me probably no but not certain.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=104586.msg720090#msg720090">Quote from: MaidMandy on January 11, 2013, 10:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think i&#039;d just stay classy and copy Stevie Nicks from Fleetwood Mac - she hired someone to blow coke up her bum through a straw! ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I wonder how much they were paid as well. ???&nbsp; I would have done it for a cup of coffee as payment.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=104586.msg720525#msg720525">Quote from: DiamondSky on January 12, 2013, 01:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">.... as sort of a my body is a temple sort of guy, hating a part of my body is sort of uncalled for....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I as well.

I originally thought anal would be excruciating for the guy not the girl, I was wrong on that too. (I thought it would pull back the..... yeah, OWE!!)&nbsp; :&#039;( Oh and the poop thing? Yeah, I originally thought that as well. When I was 10. So no, it need not be an urban legend, just use your head. <br /><br />Hmm, injecting sounds painful or scary or dangerous of tricky or all of the above, hmm, could you just use a finger instead?

				OPi is right. Use the least amount of liquid possible for your dose... <br /><br />You don&#039;t want to squirt 8ml&#039;s up there and have a nice diarrhea fart 10 minutes later. <br /><br />Friend of mine was explaining plugging with buprenorphine/suboxone the bio availability is much higher. <br /><br />30% vs 54% <br /><br />This could be the case with many other drugs. You could require a small dose for the same affects

				Personally, I think it would be hot if me and a bunch of my girlfriends got together and started plugging each other. My boyfriend and his friends?

A few things that drop it into the &quot;better&quot; category for the way me and my GF use it at home to cuddle all night is:<br /><br />She doesn&#039;t get the quesies when we plug<br />It doesn&#039;t matter what you ate the onset is predictable<br />It takes a little less to get high because none of the MDMA is getting filtered out by the stomach<br /><br />Those pros work for me the way I use it. If you&#039;re taking it to go out clubbing with a bunch of friends it&#039;s honestly probably preferable to just take it orally so everyone is on a similar page and no one has to think about anyone else&#039;s butt. With pills I sometimes get the fiend going and if I don&#039;t feel higher 1/2 hour after taking it I want to take another, since the plugging hits within minutes for me if I am already high it&#039;s easier for us to stay high when we do it that way. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;d make sure you sanitize the syringe between now and when you use it again... but if you think so then yes that should be fine.. also if you add a air bubble by the end of the plunger that would lessen the amount still in the tip.

If this was FB and you were my vendor I would give you 5/5 for this post. The thing about guys is that, because some are homophobic and thinking that EVERYthing will make them look gay, which they have a problem with, how do you think that makes me feel in a threesome situation? So of course, there you get the &quot;fuck that gay shit&quot; kind of shit. It&#039;s not my fault it&#039;s his. 2 girls OTOH are much better to get along with as they are more self-confident with this issue. Hope this explains the whole male part of the human race on where we stand on that issue. (I don&#039;t have an issue they do.)<br /><br />Girls plugging each other? Yeah okay, that&#039;s hot, even if I don&#039;t know what it means. (I think I do but not 100% sure, I&#039;m almost positive but just in case.) Hmm. I have PLENTY of imagination, and your bf sounds like he does as well, so don&#039;t give ^, we maybe one in a million but we are out there lol. (He sounds fun, I would +K him just for his attitude to the whole thing at the festival. It&#039;s fucking hot when your partner turns around and is okay with something you thought they wouldn&#039;t be. Immediate turn on.) And you are correct, it&#039;s all those &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; dull as dishwater guys out there that make us real men even more sexy, god knows how that is even possible. How can you get better than a 10/10? Easy! What YOU said up there....^<br /><br />I love your mindset with this issue. My god. Total turn on. If I had a dollar for every time I got turned on by a liberated post made by you SR girls I would have made at least 50 dollars by now..... totally amazing, I love this shit. Brilliant. Total turn on. I love it. I just wish you had videotaped it. Love it! Awesome. <br /><br />RE leaky ass, yes you are correct, asses are not supposed to leak, I don&#039;t know who would have said that; they may need to see a doctor. Mine is tight, dry, and clean, I figured it was that way for most people. Even Belladonna, who has been phucked 40 ways sideways and had so many things put ^ there, she still manages to keep it springy. Tell this man/woman to see a doctor.

Neither do I, but from what I&#039;ve heard not good, they would have frowned upon plugging. I frown on certain things like bullying and so froth but not on plugging, I think people should mind their business and let other people do whatever they want, I just wouldn&#039;t advise the dog thing, that&#039;s a bit off. But plugging? Yeah, I got no problem with that, why would I? I&#039;m just staggered so many people voted No on the pole. I&#039;m starting to suspect there are secretly a lot of nuns on this site, but that;s okay, whatever rocks their boat I guess.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.

I practiced with 1ml and 3ml. Water stayed in both times :)<br />My syringe has a nice shape so it eases in nicely... unfortunately it&#039;s shape also causes about .2ml of water to stay in the tip. <br />So is it better to use 3ml so I don&#039;t lose as much MDA?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah those little oral syringes are a pain like that. There are really two solutions:<br /><br />Have someone else plug you (see, this thread had a point!) and they can have a little bubble of air at the top that pushes out the last bit of liquid when they push the plunger down. Think doggy style on the couch if you need to picture it.<br /><br />Or Just plug with 3-4 ML of water (the less you use the more stays in the syringe but the more you use the less comfortable it is), let it get in there good and then suck a bit more water in and plug one more time if that makes sense. <br /><br />Personally, I normally just end up doing more MDMA as the night goes on so I don&#039;t worry about the last little bit until my end up the night dose. As long as it&#039;s dissolved in there pretty good the amount left in the syringe at 3-4ml water to 120mg MDMA is probably not more than 2-5mg.

Personally the older I get the less I really understand the distinction between genders. As a kid it was really clear cut but honestly my girlfriend today is more butch and manly than most anyone else I have dated and yet we have a very synergistic energy that lets us both be openly sexually expressive to one another. While I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m just a normal straight guy, I have to appreciate that this girl, who is the love of my life, is so not because of the size of her breasts or the space between her legs but because of who she is as a person. Knowing this kind of love I would probably be gay if she had been born a guy since I would want that soul near me regardless of the body it came in.

Glad it was a successful trip for you. If you ever get adventurous it works just as well for 2CB too. The weird thing with 2CB is the dose seems to be about the same for me popping it in the mouth or plugging it but the come up is much quicker plugging. I&#039;m sort of a fan of winding down X with the 2CB just because the next day really is so much less hang overy for me and my girlfriend even with our occasional binges. In fact it&#039;s more an an after glow the next day than anything with a touch of 2CB at the end.<br />

				If you don&#039;t have a problem sharing your drugs (believe it or not, many people are very stingy with their drugs), and their down with it, I don&#039;t see any problem with it.

My boyfriend and his friends? Probably not.<br />It&#039;s really sad these guys just jump straight to &quot;fuck that gay shit.&quot; SO little imagination. I would have thought people that bought illegal drugs internationally would be a little adventurous.<br />But I suppose it&#039;s all those &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; dull as dishwater guys out there that make real men so sexy :)<br />Me and my man usually shower before we go party anyway so cleanliness is not really a concern... And for anyone that it is? Christ eat some vegetables and take some vitamins, I don&#039;t know what kind of fucked up greasy lifestyle you have to live to have a leaky ass but if you&#039;re that dirty then why are you fucking around with drugs in the first place?!<br /><br />Bah<br /><br />But as a side note; Once me and my fella were at a music festival. We woke up on our last day and decided we didn&#039;t want to bring any drugs home on the trip with us (besides our meds and of course a substantial sack of herb) so right away I take a line and I started sucking him off. He got all hot and bothered and like any good girl I started playing with his ass. I was in the &quot;what the fuck, we&#039;re at a festival let&#039;s go crazy kind of mood&quot; so I slipped 2 tabs of acid up there. At the time I had no idea if it would even work but I tried anyway. Sure enough after awhile I told him and he thought I was crazy, his reaction? He flipped me over, stuck two in my ass, and started plowing away. By the time we finished we were both tripping balls (no pun intended) and absolutely blissful. It was probably some of the best sex I&#039;ve ever had, and that day/night the visuals were so intense I would STOP on the dancefloor just to watch all the lazers :)<br /><br />Moral of the story most people don&#039;t like it because they&#039;ve never tried.

If you dose a small dose it&#039;s a lot like a tiny MDMA body high and as you dose more the body high stays the same&#039;ish but you start getting some visual fun with it. I&#039;m not sure how far you pushed it with MDA but once you get up there in the doses it can be a little visually trippy too and this runs about those lines. <br /><br />GHB is on my list to try next. My girlfriend and I are having a drug-i-moon (think honeymoon for for people that don&#039;t want to get married but feel getting tattoos, drugs and a suite with a whirlpool hottub means about the same thing)&nbsp; in a few weeks and I think our night is going to be MDMA followed buy a little 2CB followed by a decent dose of GHB to end the night with. From everything I hear GHB is VERY similar to alcohol but it fits in pretty nicely with the combo above. <br /><br />I think the comedown is pretty different for everyone. Dose for dose I normally feel better than my GF the night after a binge but I weigh more so that likely has a lot to do with it. I think most people, if they stick to a dose and a single half or smaller reup are fine and even still in a pretty good mood the next day. Keep in mind that tons of the folks that use this stuff are out raving, dancing and dehydrating all night as well as mixing it with insane combos of cuts and alcohol. For those of us that like the indoor loved up feeling laying in bed with someone we like I think it&#039;s a little easier on us. For some magical reason though 2CB, even a small dose, at the end of a trip seems to put a bit of a click in my heals the next day.

				<br />I&#039;ve played with the G&#039;s for over 15 years. <br /><br />I hate &quot;GHB&quot; liquid! <br /><br />Buy &quot;GHB powder&quot; or &quot;GBL&quot;. <br /><br />Wonderful stuff by itself or with mdxx or speed. <br /><br />If new to the stuff be very careful when re-dosing or trying to drive. I am very cautious with selling this stuff to someone unless the are very well informed and responsible.

				Diamond- Happy DruggyMoon!&nbsp; interesting points. I see what you mean about hardcore ravers (Ace) and people like us :) <br /><br />Stinky- I&#039;ve been reading and hearing that careful dosing is so crucial with GHB. I would def be nervous with liquid!

				GHB is no fun, after 2 days of using it twice a day I developed withdrawal symptoms that included zaps in the brain, and insomnia worse than any heroin withdrawal I have ever had...<br /><br />all in all ghb = not worth it. I had about 150 ML left over and I gave it away to my buddy, by far my best idea involving GHB yet..

I sort of like the powder idea just because in the 1-3 gram range misdosing seems so much less likely. Of all the horror stories I&#039;ve read it&#039;s always took a cap of this or drank a little of that. The main reason the stuff can be sketchy is that folks that couldn&#039;t pass a a green light feel qualified to &quot;make&quot; the liquid of essentially unknown strength or composition. At least the powders require a LITTLE more effort from what I understand.

				<br />Yeah I hate GHB liquid due to not always knowing the strength. 1.5 grams of ghb powder is awesome, 1.5ml of gbl is the same to me. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t had any issues with withdrawals ever. I do not use all the time though. Mostly to add to other chems or to get a buzz on by itself.

				I wouldn&#039;t doubt a second about plugging my girlfriend or any other girl for that matter if I&#039;d be single, but chances of that happening are slim.<br />But plugging another man, that would probably be a no-go for me, and probably a no-go for the other man as well.
