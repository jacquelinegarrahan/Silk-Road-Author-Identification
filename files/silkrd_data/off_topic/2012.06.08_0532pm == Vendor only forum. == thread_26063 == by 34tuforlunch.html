				A forum for vendors only would be very useful. It would be a place for us to discuss how to spot scams, create a list of shitty buyers and what the problems with certain buyers have been and anything related to vending.<br /><br />Hopefully I am not the only vendor that thinks this would be very useful.

				yeah there is a hidden vendors section, you can apply to join the SR vendor group, then admin will look at your vendors account, products you sell, and feedback about you and&nbsp; if all is legit&nbsp; you will be added to the group.<br /><br />to apply all you need to do is,<br /><br />1. Click on profile<br />2. hover over modify profile<br />3. click group membership<br />4. request vendor status<br /><br />once it has been approved you will be able to see the vendors section when you go to the main topics board index page.<br /><br />see you there&nbsp; :)

				yeah there is such a thing.&nbsp; its the roundtable so to speak.. Its been covered in a few other threads but I&#039;ll roughly quote limetless and trustusjones on what they said<br /><br />-you have to be a vendor that sells illegal stuff (drugs) not just digital goods etc<br />-you have to have some transactions under you&#039;re belt, (they said not sure exactly how many ) but its something &quot;like 5 wont cut it&quot;<br />-there&#039;s a few ways to seek membership/admittance but just read the post ABOVE BY RR for the best way.&nbsp; <br />-It&#039;s just a place where the vendors discuss scammers and share their names to prevent loss/scamming and where they share info on susupected LEO buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Agreed.&nbsp; It is indeed a great idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;I personally tried to get in but without going into too much detail went about it the wrong way due to a misunderstanding....I only have about 20 transactions so Its hard to know what it would take, maybe 50-80 or something and to be a top 30%&#039;er.&nbsp; That would be my best guess...I hope _____ inbox doesn&#039;t get flooded.&nbsp; I think he negged my second attempt.lol.&nbsp; fair enough....Ill work as hard as I have to to get in eventually .&nbsp; I hate scammers and the idea of losing money and despise the idea of LEO posing as buyers, I would love to know who the suspected Leo buyers are so I can steer clear if they ever try to purchase from me, I hope none already have :/&nbsp; Good luck to everyone I hope I summed this up accurately .

				Just a guess.&nbsp; But you probably have to be one of those &quot;over 300 transactions&quot; sellers before they consider you.
