				You can make your own ayahuasca from buying things on clearnet : Mimosa Hostilis + Syrian Rue, basically, but it&#039;s more complicated than that. Pharmahuasca is a little too expensive IMO.

				well I want to do this really soon but Ive not put in an order right at this moment till this gets sussed out cause im probably going to jail for dropping dirty here in a couple weeks.&nbsp; <br />My goal is an ego death.<br />I plan on being alone however I have some good friends I might go see. but I really think i should be looking inwards at me not at my relationship with some one else. <br />Id like to escape this reality and enter sort of a quasi consciouss lucid dream state....? if you know what I mean? I want to see the shadow people and talk with them and receive guidence. <br />idk, suicide before my piss test isn&#039;t completely off the table, we&#039;ll just see what this trip shows me. <br /><br />got any vendor recommendations?

While the so-called &quot;active alkaloids&quot; of ayahuasca are indeed harmala + DMT, there are however many more alkaloids (plus lipids, oils, sugars etc. etc.)&nbsp; in the plants used in ayahuasca themselves that also if not &quot;active&quot; in the psychedelic sense (at last for what science knows today) anyway can subtly change the experience.<br />However the type of voyage in its general aspect has the same connotation, the differences will be, as I said, much more of a subtle nature (and these changes depend also on the types of plants used to begin with).<br /><br />The great advantage of a pharmahuasca is that it is very easy to use. No need to drink awful tasting tea or anything of the sort. For a first time it is indicated since for the first time it will anyway very difficult to understand those differences. Still I personally think that if then you are interested you should then try a pure ayahuasca brew since the type of &quot;energy&quot; you will encounter has some definitive difference (it&#039;s difficult to explain what it is meant by this but when you are there you will surely understand it).
