				Title: <strong>Drugs and the festival scene</strong><br />

				Recently I was reading the information page for a festival and it said that people caught selling or taking drugs would be thrown out or arrested. Instead of the traditional spiel, there was another sentence afterward that said that drugs were ruining the festival scene and that it should be about the music rather than the drugs.<br /><br />Most festivals that I&#039;ve been to will tell you not to bring drugs, but they tend to turn a blind eye when it comes to the issue. I think that it&#039;s strange that the aforementioned festival included the second sentence about drugs ruining the festival scene which makes me think that they are serious.<br /><br />Does anyone think that drugs ruin the scene at festivals? Is it possible that in the future, because of negative press, that drugs will no longer be present at festivals?<br /><br />I personally think that drugs have a negative and positive presence in the scene. The positive is that people will actually show up because well, there are drugs there. Drugs also allow people to relax and enjoy themselves. The negative aspect is that there are always those people who over do it. There is also the possibility that vendors won&#039;t see as much money because people would rather spend it on drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just been thinking about this a lot and I would like to see what other people think. Please, post your thoughts on this issue.

				&nbsp;I&#039;ll try my best with my input here, but I&#039;m a little one the floaty side. Thanks to my fave Temazepam. I use to be a pretty hard core raver, in the end was getting in to heavier shit like coke/ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve been to two WEMF festivals, the last in 2006, which was my going out with a bang weekend, as I had just been turned in by my parents for my drug addiction(mid 20&#039;s) and was about to lose my family, <br /><br />&nbsp;Does anyone think that drugs ruin the scene at festivals?&nbsp; Yes and no. I believe it depends on the drug and the persons state of mind. By the second or third day a great percentage at wemf are fucking sketch bags, some angry.&nbsp; Lots of fights.... which does ruin the whole unity aspect of a rave. For myself, by the end of the weekend with my situation I was not happy and ruined the vibe for myself and friends. I had to much in my system and the whole situation at home was heavily on my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;At this festival, I went with a friend security guard actually. You have your jack ass workers and the ones who do turn a blind eye. The ones who don&#039;t go on major power trips and I did happen to see some guards taking matters in their own hands physically. <br /><br />&nbsp;I think drugs will always be at these types of events, besides music that&#039;s what people come for. It&#039;s the ones who go in and completely over do it with hard drugs i.e ice that may ruin it for the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;And if most of this makes no fucking sense please forgive me. lol. And I must add if your wondering how I took my whole shitty situations. I have been clean since that weekend. 6 years later, as an old fuck, I decided a one night time with K was in order. I&#039;m sure I can control myself now, I have a wonderful life and full family again. I think I deserve it. I decided to go against contacting any old friends for connections and this is how I ended up n this beauty of a site. :) I feel much safe purchasing here then off the streets.

				I think it&#039;s all about what drugs are most prevalent at the festival, what type of festival it is, and the type of people that festival draws in.<br /><br />Obviously more problems will arise at a hardcore rave scene or metal fest than at an outdoor peaceful type festival like the old school Woodstock.<br /><br />Similar to how psychedelics effect us, it&#039;s all about set and setting I guess.
