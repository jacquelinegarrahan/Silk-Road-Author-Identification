				I say you should go to the nearest supermarket/organic food market and buy an apple. Poke a hole through the top with a pen, then poke another from the side. Make sure both holes intersect. Pack you weed at the top, smoke through the other hole. You should google it, i&#039;m sure there is a guide as to how to make one out there. You can also use a potato, but i think apples are much better. Of course, it would be better if you bought a pipe, but an apple is really cheap and it gets the job done.<br /><br />Good luck :)!

				Get a vaporizer, the best bang for you buck is the Arizer Xtreme Q. You can get on ebay for $150 shipped if you look. You utilize 95% of the THC as opposed to the 75% you burn with joints and pipes.<br />Plus, it is much better on your lungs.

				I also use a vaporizer called &quot;the buddah&quot;. Its not the high dollar one but gets the job done. If I dont use that I will use my pipe and pack a bowl. I havent smoked joints in many years b/c like you said, they really do waste a lot since when your not hitting it, its just burning the herb still that you arent getting. Plus the herb that I get you really only need to smoke a bowl or half a bowl to get high. Now back when I was younger and could only get schwag. We would roll joints or blunts but that stuff was crap compared the stuff I get now.

				go to any hardware or plumbing supply store (home depot, lowes, etc) and buy some brass fittings and steel water faucet screens. Fire up the screens before you use them to burn off any toxic coatings. Install the screen high up in the bowl part and do 1 hits.

				Go to youtube and search for &#039;how to roll a joint&#039;<br /><br />There&#039;s a thousand videos showing you how to roll the perfect joint.<br /><br /><br />Personally, I only smoke occasionally and prefer joints - I don&#039;t really care about a little bit of wastage.

				Let&#039;s see, the best way to smoke weed is too take a hit or so before work to calm yourself before seeing your asshole boss, next sneak out at lunch and take a hit or two and it makes the afternoon seem much more cheerful then it really is, and finally on the way home while stuck in endless traffic take a couple of hits and suddenly the traffic is not as bad as you thought it was....<br /><br />Just my opinion or course...

				I much prefer an icy bong over anything else, but you are in a jam.&nbsp; The apple is the cleanest way for you to do it, that is also cheap and easy. You can order some nice pieces at good prices through grasscity.&nbsp; I like joints on the go, due to the discreetness and ability to hide eat if needed.&nbsp; It takes some practice to roll one, but you can buy a roller for a couple of FRN&#039;s at the tobacco store.

				Go to your local head shop. You can google head shop and you will find places that sell pipes etc. I use a Glass pipe because it is easy to clean and doesn&#039;t waste as much as joints or blunts.&nbsp; Glass pipes can also be cleaned easily and allow you to limit your tokes.&nbsp; Joints burn faster than blunts/swishas because they are made of tobacco. Glass pipes are good for cyphers and easy to pack away when you are done. One drawback is that they break easily if the glass is not thick. Grass City does not ship everywhere.<br /><br />I never tried a vaporizer but I hear it is the best way to go because it is less damaging to your lungs and throat.

				I don&#039;t want to come across as un-PC as my original joke would have but uh....do you have a poor part of town?&nbsp; If so just go there to any corner store. They usually have pipes for sale there and cheap.&nbsp; Around here you can pick up a decent glass spoon type pipe for 5-10 at almost any non-corperate owned chain gas station.<br /><br />In the meanwhile practice on your rolling technique.&nbsp; &nbsp; Blunts are a waste but are the easiest to roll, after that move to joints.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can&#039;t afford anything short of the rolling papers use a dollar bill, you can usually roll a semi ok J with one if you dont put too much pressure on it and make it too tight.<br /><br />I&#039;d say this:<br /><br /><br />For your apartment, more likely your room (sorry just think you may be a minor but I could give a shit less tbh) get a bong, 1 foot is a good start.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve noticed the cheapest that are still good glass on glass are found oddly enough at porno stores, around here a cnote gets you a decent one (not name brand but utility wise very good).<br /><br />For travel if you are on foot you must learn to roll, like another poster said it&#039;s very good for discretion and if you get suspected you can eat it or toss it with it being harder to find.<br /><br />Pipes seem to be after thoughts on my end.&nbsp; I&#039;ll grab one if It&#039;s impulse shopping but I also prefer paper so it&#039;s easy to think of them that way for me.<br /><br />Good thing about papers is you can take a very very small amount and roll a nice pinner and get high from that where as a bowl even a piece instead of a tube it seems like you need more&nbsp; to get the same out of it.

				All of these are good solutions, but are incomplete explanations for a smoker newbie. There are 3 or 4 main ways to smoke, I&#039;ll explain them and the options that lie within. Which method is the best is dependent on what you prefer and how much money you have to spend.<br /><br />1. Joints/Blunts - Pretty simple, buy some rolling papers. Most are good, ask an experienced smoker which they prefer. Some are longer, some are shorter, some are thicker, some are thinner. There are lots of videos on how to roll joints, in all sorts of ways, but this is a convenient way to carry weed if you&#039;re going to smoke it at a party, concert, in public (disguised as a cig), etc. <br /><br />Blunts are cigars packed with weed. Pretty easy, split open a cigar, empty the tobacco, replace with weed and seal it back up and smoke it. You can make really fat blunts which give bigger hits. Blunts can take up a lot of weed and are almost a status symbol. It&#039;s definitely not the most efficient way to smoke, but the *cool* pot-smokers smoke blunts, especially for celebrations, like birthdays (hence, the &quot;birthday blunt&quot;). Snoop Dawg smokes blunts exclusively. Just sayin&#039;.<br /><br />Joints/blunts get anywhere from ~20%-50% of the THC in the weed depending on how fat (fatter is less efficient, but gives bigger hits).<br /><br />2. Bongs/Pipes/Water pipes/one-hitter - Next, you have your typical pipe, piece, bowl, whatever you call it. It&#039;s a simple concept - a bowl attached to a cylindrical tube with which you inhale air through the bowl and in to your mouth. Light the lighter by the bowl, inhale to pull the flame into the bowl and onto the weed, keep inhaling, and then after you&#039;re done taking a hit, let your hand off of what is called the &quot;rush hole&quot; and the air will come through the rush hole into your mouth, instead of through the bowl, so you can clear what smoke is left in the pipe. Any experienced smoker should be able to teach you how to take a hit out of a bowl, but a taking a truly GOOD hit off a bowl can be an art. If you want me to detail that, send me a message and I can teach you haha, but most amateurs just light the entire bowl.<br /><br />Pipes range from wooden and glass to apples. They come small as a pencil stub and bigger than your torso. $2-$1000, there are a ton of pipes out there and can be expensive if they&#039;re considered to be artworks. Any respectable smoker has at least a decent pipe of his own, and some collect them. Small pipes can be good for portability, but also just to smoke at home. Pipes typically get named and are its fun to share your collection with your friends. The apple pipe is an easy cheap way to make a disposable pipe and try it if you want to look it up on youtube.<br /><br />Water pipes (aka bubblers) are pipes that bring the smoke through water in order to attempt to filter the bad things out of the smoke so it&#039;s not as bad for your lungs, and also makes it a smoother hit. Typically there is a little refillable chamber that you can put water in and refill. These can be annoying because you can&#039;t just turn the bowl upside down to empty it, because the water will go through the bowl and get it wet. Can&#039;t smoke with a wet bowl. Other than this, water pipes are pretty much the same as regular pipes. Some claim that the filtering also filters out some THC, but I personally don&#039;t find that to be true.<br /><br />Bongs are the next step up. Usually with a wide cylinder leading to a vial bottom filled with water and a tube (called a downstem) attached to a removable bowl. You pack the weed in the bowlpiece and hit it exactly like a pipe, except you inhale at the top of the tube and pull the bowl out of the bong instead of using a rush hole. Usually they&#039;re used to smoke at home as they&#039;re usually bigger, but sometimes people get a nice bong bag to carry it around in and show to their friends. They&#039;re also named usually and some smokers collect them, similar to pipes. Bongs are known for their legendarily huge hits. Some bongs can be less than 1ft tall while some are are huge (6ft+) and have some cool features that filter the smoke:<br /><br />Diffused downstems - some downstems (the tube that sticks into the water) are perforated with holes or slits that make it so the smoke goes through a bunch of small bubbles as opposed to one big one at the bottom of the tube. This increases the surface area of the bubbles and provides more filtration.<br /><br />Percolating bowlpieces - some bowlpieces have a little water chamber of their own and filter much like a bubbler that filters water similarly. These are usually bought separately and can be used to upgrade a bong. They can be a little annoying however, if you have to take out a big bowlpiece every time you take a hit. However, it can make for a pretty epic smoking experience and can filter the smoke, VERY well since it&#039;s the first thing the smoke goes through.<br /><br />Percolators - Sometimes in the tube at the top, there are little chambers that can be filled with water, and a percolator that forces the smoke through water a second (or maybe even third/fourth) time. More holes in the percolator = more surface area again, and more filtration.<br /><br />Mouthguard - sometimes in the tube, typically near the top-ish, is a dome with holes in it that is used to protect the smoker from pulling bongwater (GROSS!) through the tube and into their mouth. No extra filtration though.<br /><br />Icecatcher - usually the glassblower blows some glass spikes into the tube so that they can catch ice that is dropped into the tube. When you put ice in the tube, the smoke is forced to go around the ice and cool down the smoke. This can be really nice because what usually makes a hit harsh is how hot it gets.<br /><br />Since bongs/pipes/one-hitters are all very similar in their smoking mechanic, their efficiency is very similar, and depending on what you&#039;re smoking with and how, they&#039;re about 50%-80% efficient. if you smoke the entire hit (inhale until it stops burning) it can be very efficient, but if you only take part of it, the weed burns out and the smoke goes into the air and is wasted. One-hitters are pipes with small bowls that you pack literally one hit into and are VERY efficient if you can take it all in one hit. The only thing that prevents this method from being 100% efficient (aside from smoker-error) is that the lighter burns at ~1400 degrees Fahrenheit and destroys some of the weed in the process of burning. This is why you should not touch the weed with the flame any longer than you have to. One way that I avoid this, is by using a soldering iron. Mine heats up to about ~700 degrees Fahrenheit and makes for a more efficient hit. Also, as far as lighters go, Bic is the best, and that&#039;s more or less indisputable. <br /><br />3. Vaporizers - These machines are, in my opinion, much more easy to explain than bongs/pipes. The machine fills a chamber of heat to ~350-400 degrees Fahrenheit and then blows the heated air over the weed. Since THC turns to vapor at these temperatures, the inhaled vapor will get you high. Also, since you don&#039;t actually burn the weed, it&#039;s more efficient and since there&#039;s no smoke, it&#039;s MUCH better for your lungs. It is both the most efficient and healthiest way to smoke, making it in my opinion the best way to smoke (using the term &#039;smoke&#039; loosely, it&#039;s vaping).<br /><br />There are two types of vaporizers, whip and bag. Whip vaporizers use a tube to inhale through (and pull air over the weed) Big whips are good for passing around in a circle. Whips are usually the cheaper option for vaporizers. The other kind of vaporizer is a bag vaporizer. Instead of a hose, it uses a fan that blows air into a bag, using valves to make sure it doesn&#039;t leak. You can separate the bag from the vaporizer and pass it around for a good time.<br /><br />Generally, the indisputable king of vaporizers is The Volcano (Storz and Bickel), a bag vaporizer that costs ~$700. If you don&#039;t have that kind of cash, there&#039;s a lot of debate about what lower-budget vaporizers are the best, and you can look around google and what not if you want information on that. Also, if you want to try a cheap vaporizer, similar to the apple pipe, you can make a vaporizer out of a lightbulb and a lighter, so if you want to try that, you could look that up. Vaporizers can be anywhere from ~80%-95% efficient depending on the quality of the vaporizer. Vaporizers take a long time to smoke so it&#039;s hard to get the big hits that bongs can offer.<br /><br />I smoke every day and use my Volcano about 80% of the time. I enjoy a good blunt for celebration and joints when I&#039;m going to concerts. My bong is a work of art and I like to hit it up every now and then when I share it with others. I also like to show off the volcano, but it&#039;s not as fun as taking huge bong rips. What the best way to smoke is is typically dependent on the situation. Smoke on.<br /><br />Source: I smoke weed er&#039;day.
