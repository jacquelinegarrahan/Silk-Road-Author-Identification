Do yourself a favor and stay away from stimulants, THC might make it worse unless you have some strong indica but your best bet would be either benzos or ambien.

				I&#039;ve taken a high dose, long acting methylphenidate dose daily for approx 2 years, why stay away from stimulants?&nbsp; They&#039;re not my favorite but that doesn&#039;t mean there isn&#039;t a time and a place appropriate for use.<br /><br /><br />Would 5-10mg cyclobenzaprine taken orally help?

				in a perfect world, i use an opiate to bring me down after using meth. it doesn&#039;t make me sleep but i&#039;m feeling so good i really don&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />usually though, i just drink myself into a stupor and take 100mg or so of diphenhydramine (benadryl) <br /><br />the trick is to start plying yourself with alcohol way before you start to come down, so you go from up to drunk with no suicidal thoughts.<br /><br /><br />disclaimer: this is terrible advice. xo

				Would like 2 beers, 10mg cyclobenzaprine, and bong hits do the trick?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d have already taken an opioid but I&#039;m temporarily unable to nod :(<br /><br /><br />Also, I just smoked approx 200-300mg of QUALITY hash, and I don&#039;t even feel stoned.&nbsp; Still just zooming, thoughts? <br /><br />Looking for some first hand experience and input here.<br /><br /><br />thanks all

Although I would recommend xanax more than ambien as a CNS depressant. Ambien has just put me in a braindead type of pseudo-sleep before, with some trippy vibes all night. It wasn&#039;t pleasant. A 2 mg xan bar is your best friend in this situation.

				I remember my tweaking days, lol as i write this i&#039;m trying to come down off of some geek, i&#039;d have all the intentions of laying down and going to sleep. Laying down exhausted but your brain just won&#039;t shut the fuck up after 5 days of non stop action. Then 2 days of solid sleep just to run the streets again. FUCK METH as a lifestyle choice.

I thought I was the only one that likes this part, maybe because I&#039;m an insomniac. The other day I just couldn&#039;t sleep after testing out this new coke batch so it had been a full 24 hours with no sleep and I started seeing shadow people walking on the walls to me that was a free psychedelic show but to someone else that might mean a trip to the ER&nbsp; :D
