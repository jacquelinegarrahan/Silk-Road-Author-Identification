				Hi, <br /><br />I will be departing from the UK to Turkey at some point in the next week or two and I stuck on whether to take my own hash over with me (not soap bar actually a pleasant smoke), I ain&#039;t to sure about the methods I have been toying with, so I&#039;m curious if any of silk roads users have any advice for me, whether to take it or not, ideas on how to do it or just try to source once im there.

				IMO attempting to take drugs onto a plane just isn&#039;t worth it.. i mean what may just be a small fine here for some hash, may be months in jail in turkey..&nbsp; <br />Ask around when youre there to see if you can get your hands on some. Much safer option.

				I read through the grapevine - so don&#039;t quote me on this - that if you have luggage with metal carry handles, you just slip them off and put your stash in the hollow tube? Now, I&#039;ve never tried it and I don&#039;t condone something that might not work, but damn, if the tubes are made of steel you stand a good chance, no, a great chance of slipping through metal detectors.

				You might find this article interesting - http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/smuggling-weed-is-easy. <br />Alternatively you could try getting it posted from the SR to your hotel?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have experience with Airlines, but I have taken back about 5g skunk from Amsterdam twice on a ferry - on my second time the car was stopped by sniffer dogs on the way back Calais-England and got away with it, after that incident I probably wouldn&#039;t do it again.

				I wouldn&#039;t say that doing drugs in Turkey is a nutty idea, I have a few times when I have gone there but I wouldn&#039;t go ANYWHERE NEAR the idea of trying to take drugs into a country via a flight full stop, not just Turkey. It&#039;s easy to find hash in Turkey anyway, no need to make yourself into a drug mule for personal smoke. It&#039;s daft.

				I&#039;d absolutely not try and bring drugs into Turkey, especially via an airplane.<br /><br />Fun Banjo fact:<br />I used to smuggle cigarettes into Turkey via the land border with Iraq. Not a job, but just an incidental favor I used to do for people.

				Thanks for all the input and advice everyone, I think as many of you have pointed out it seems a bit too risky to attempt taking any over with me.<br /><br />Hopefully I can source a bit safely so I can have a nice night time smoke.
