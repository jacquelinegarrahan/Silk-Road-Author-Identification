				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />Whats your views on this?<br /><br />I would prefer if these idiots diddnt broadcast to the whole world about this place. I found a few videos on youtube with people unboxing DMT or talking about SR like its fucking walmart or something.<br /><br />I told 3 people about the SR since i found it and they are my 3 fellow astronauts, we have an understanding that was pretty much common sense, dont go and tell a bunch of people about it. The longer the lid stays on this the longer i hope it can operate :)

				Agreed on this - don&#039;t mind lots of people using it but I won&#039;t tell anyone about it unless I&#039;m confident he will treat the knowledge with respect.

				It&#039;s inevitable as the site grows.<br /><br />Many who find their way here are discreet enough not to draw unwanted attention to the remainder of the community.<br /><br />A handful are dumbasses who will get the rest of us caught.<br /><br />The sad thing is, that handful grows daily until it will be SR&#039;s undoing.

				The amount of advertising SR gets from dumbasses uploading to YouTube is negligible compared to the amount of attention SR gets from official press, like news stories, the Gawker article, etc.<br /><br />If someone wants to post himself doing something illegal on clearnet, that&#039;s his call.

				SilkRoad is on the darkweb, onionland, or whatever you choose to call it for a reason, it is AN ANONYMOUS BLACKMARKET PLACE primarily dealing with the sale and purchase of CONTRABAND. Why on earth make a video about it, bragging about your purchases,let alone&nbsp; on YouTube, the second most visited site on the Internet, to billions of people across the world. These &#039;Youtubers&#039; can be traced, tracked, and have a nice knock on the door, well deserved as well. Fucking morons, &#039;First rule of Fight Club is to never speak about Fight Club&#039;. <br /><br />These people do not care about their anonymity (the first rule for being an SR consumer), if they don&#039;t care about their anonymity they should not be making their purchases from SilkRoad, simple as that.

				Yah it even goes to a deeper level then that though when your serious about security. My &quot;vendors&quot; take care of the risk and mess while I am the guy that can magically make it all go away.... hehehe. If you have the capital to pull % into your court with start up its mighty sweet son. 20 hrs of computer work a week for ..... well can&#039;t kiss and tell on that. When you push it to the pure cyber game is when you start winning. TRUST!

Its the links that make me nervous, there&#039;s a bloke selling hash on here with a video link to it, I&#039;m sure that&#039;s just asking for trouble.

				You can find tons of crap on Youtube now. I remember a salvia epidemic where it was all over the news and it ended up getting outlawed in a bunch of states because of the youtube videos. You can see videos of people breaking through on DMT on youtube now! Plus all the drug videos on youtube now is crazy than what I remember before.
