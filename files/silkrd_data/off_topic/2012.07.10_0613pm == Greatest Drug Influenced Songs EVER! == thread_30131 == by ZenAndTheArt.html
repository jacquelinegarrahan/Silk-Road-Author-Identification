				The whole album &#039;Waterworld&#039; by the Leak Bros<br />Underground hip hop artists Cage and Tame One started doing a lot of PCP and this album was the result.<br />Not too well known, but I fucking love it -- dark, raw hip hop with a fresh sound unlike anything else.

Well the album with Kids, Electric Feel and the other track that charted well, that I can&#039;t remember the name of right now, was. Their most resent album left me feeling a bit.. meh.<br /><br />Notorious BIG&#039;s - Ten Crack Commandments song has to be one of the best tracks about dealing I can think of.<br /><br />Have any of our US brothers heard of the Shaman - Ebeneezer Goode song. It was back in the early 90s when it came out and I think it got to #1 in the UK. It was a dance song with a (sort of) rap in each verse about this character called Ebeneezer Goode. What made it stand out was, the character Ebeneezer Goode was a simile (analogy? metaphor?) for Ecstasy. The whole song can be interpreted to be about taking Ecstasy. With the chorus going; &quot; &#039;Eezer Goode, &#039;Eezer Goode... He&#039;s Ebeneezer Goode&quot; (Es-are-good, Es-are-good... He&#039;s Eben-Es-are-good). Which was great, because even though the whole &#039;Rave scene&#039; was in full swing, the squares still didn&#039;t catch on to the blatant pro drug lyrics in the song, till it was too late and was at #1 in the singles chart!&nbsp;

				While I do know many, most of them are not of my taste. I listen to a lot of progressive/thrash metal. Meshuggah has some pretty crazy songs, their lead guitarist`s own solo project from the 80`s is just phenomenal. While they don`t really talk about drugs a lot, most of their music is about being in a different state/aliens/space/psychosis/time/existentialism/life/etc. Also it has a lot of groove. This music is definitely not for the faint of heart:<br /><br />*=Intensity.<br /><br />Pineal Gland Optics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mTyr5lVlVE ****<br />Closed Eye Visuals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_tndxTuouY ****<br />Sum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weiXdYGuawY *****<br />Z1 reticuli: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0VvCSuUniY ***<br /><br />Music Videos: <br /><br />Bleed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc98u-eGzlc ****<br />Rational Gaze: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D08JDW_vZ5c ****<br /><br />Pretty much most Meshuggah Albums and Sol Niger Within.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Also i have this one in my mind:<br /><br />Golden Brown - The Stranglers<br /><br />In my opinion it`s about girls and heroin.<br /><br />Both highly addictive and also i can`t say which addiction is more dangerous :-)

				Ah yes Ed Sheeran. Nice one TT. He is one talented guy, especially live! That song has also reminded me of the Arctic Monkeys - When the Sun Goes Down. Not really a drug influenced song, more about prostitution, destitution and a lowlife pimp who inhabits that world.

				Every song by 1200 Micrograms. Same for Astrix, Astral Projection and Shpongle.<br /><br />Cream&#039;s Strange Brew and Tales of Brave Ulysses<br /><br />Cypress Hill&#039;s Hits from the Bong<br /><br />I think NIN&#039;s Something I Can Never Have is about chasing the dragon.<br /><br />And last but not least, Porcupine Tree&#039;s Pure Narcotic.
