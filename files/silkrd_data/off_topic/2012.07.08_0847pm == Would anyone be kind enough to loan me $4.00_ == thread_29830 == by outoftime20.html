				My SR username is CannibalC and I&#039;m unfortunately just short on an order for 10 grams of ibogain. If anyone would help me out it would be much appreciated.

				No offence OutofTime, but I&#039;m getting real sick of these &#039;can you loan me X,Y or Z&#039; threads.<br /><br />There may be some genuine people who just need an extra coin or two, due to some misfortune, miscalculation or accident. But there are LOADS of these threads, TOO many in my opinion!<br />And, there all starting to sound like, &#039;Can you spare us some change please?&#039; the mantra of the down trodden, the unwanted and the beggars. At least give some reason why your short by $4, I mean put some effort into it! Not just I&#039;m short give me $4, &#039;Yer, OK here you go&#039; ::) I&#039;m not totally heartless, your just the last straw. <br /><br />I had to have a rant and get this off my chest and I feel better now. :-X<br />For that, OutofTime I thank you.&nbsp; :D

Fair enough there are times people come up short. I have myself and I asked the vendor if he&#039;d wave the $1 postage fee.<br />You&#039;ve been here a while Ppass, you must have noticed that this is happening all the time. Maybe I was too harsh, I am just getting the impression people are asking for loans as a first resort, and not a last resort. I won&#039;t speak out again&nbsp; :-X

				I actually joined in september, just not on this account...<br /><br />Anyway, I ended up just sending the oins directly to the seller, hopefully he doesn&#039;t just keep &#039;em. Or he will have a very bad review.&nbsp; thanks guys I just sent the coins back to the loaners :) Peace love and good vibes!
