				peyote is listed on here from time to time. I bought 4 grams off it and I was disappointed. One gram got eaten and the other 3 will end up getting re-sold on Silk Road. Peyote does make you trip but it also makes me feel sick for 1-2 hours after I eat it. For me the trip is similar to the trip I get off acid or shrooms so it wasn&#039;t anything special it just cost more than acid or shrooms lol. Honestly, the best trip I ever had was caused by an XTC pill. I only took 2 pills but everyone was tripping balls no matter if they took even just one pill. I am still trying to figure out what was in those pills. I have never seen such vivid and believable haulicnations as I did that night when I was rolling.

I&#039;ve never tried it personally but it&#039;s very easy to get around here and completely legal. Many of my friends have done it and describe it as a cross between MDMA and some fucked up hallucinogen all acting really strongly at once.<br /><br />And to whoever asked, yeah, you get Mescaline in Peyote. And there was some Peyote listed a week or two ago.

				I&#039;d buy some peyote when I get some btc. I haven&#039;t seen it listed, but I don&#039;t frequent the psychedelic category often. I&#039;ve been on hiatus for a few years, but it might be time to hop back on the train. 8)<br /><br />I&#039;ll prepare it like I did San Pedro. Cut off the spines, puree the cactus, boil for at least 2 hours or until there is no more foamy gunk on top, filter with cloth and squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible, and drink the bitter green extraction. I didn&#039;t get sick and had a great trip. Ecstatic waves with visuals similar to acid, but more stimulating and longer duration. Lasted about 18 hours total including comedown. Definitely more like LSD than shrooms. Another time I drank cactus extract, I ate some shrooms. I was on another plane for a few hours. <br /><br />Most of the alkaloids are in the skin and the layer just beneath. I used more cactus the second time, but had a milder trip. San Pedro potency can vary a lot making accurate dosing difficult until you get to know your cactus.

				You should try San Pedro or Peruvian Torch. It&#039;s dead easy to get your hands on through Amazon, eBay, or even from a nursery. I&#039;ve never tried peyote, but I can&#039;t imagine it being very different from any other mescaline containing cacti.

				Ironically a mescaline listing is up now&nbsp; &nbsp;:D But i don&#039;t know if i can handle an 18 hour trip.. Staying up for 18 hours is hard enough.

				Haven&#039;t you ever seen the movie Young Guns?&nbsp; There&#039;s a scene where the Native American cooks them up some peyote soup, and they&#039;re all tripping and puking the next morning.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that if you&#039;re full blood Native American, depending on your tribe, you can get it at a pharmacy.&nbsp; It&#039;s part of their religion. Let&#039;s see a listing for some of that stuff.

				Mescaline is a psychedelic phenethylamine alkaloid, and can be found in Peyote and Peruvian Torch and San Pedro cactuses, and also in Acacia berlandieri.<br /><br />There aren&#039;t many listings of Peyote or mescaline, but listings do exist. Just keep your eyes on the Mescaline category (which currently has 2 listings):<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/category/40<br /><br />As for past listings of Peyote:<br /><br />In June, July, and September 2011 I saw some Peyote seeds for sale from Germany in the Home &amp; Garden category.<br /><br />In July there was some San Pedro and Peruvian Torch powder for sale from the US in the Psychedelics category.<br /><br />In September and October there was some Peyote seeds for sale from the USA in the Home &amp; Garden category.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen Peyote buttons for sale.<br /><br />As for past listings of Mescaline:<br /><br />In June 2011 there were 4 listings in the Psychedelics &gt; Mescaline category, all for Mescaline HCl from the US.<br /><br />In July 2011 there were 2 listings in the Psychedelics &gt; Mescaline category, one was for &quot;dried peruvian torch powder (2% mescaline).&quot;<br /><br />In September 2011 there 2 listings in the Psychedelics &gt; Mescaline category, both for mescaline acetate. And later another listing for just mescaline.<br /><br />In early October 2011 there 4 listings in the Psychedelics &gt; Mescaline category, 3 for for mescaline acetate and 1 for mescaline. Later in October there were 3 listings for mescaline acetate and 2 listings for Mescaline HCL. In mid-October there were 7 listings for mescaline.<br /><br />In early November 2011 there 3 listings in the Psychedelics &gt; Mescaline category. In mid-November there were 5 listings. In late-November there were 6 listings, including mescaline acetate and mescaline citrate. In late-November there was a listing for &quot;mescaline sulfate or chloride.&quot;<br /><br />In December 2011 there were 1 or 2 listings in the Psychedelics &gt; Mescaline category.

Â§ 469, if you decide not to check for yourself).<br /><br />But don&#039;t take my word for it.&nbsp; Check with your friends.
