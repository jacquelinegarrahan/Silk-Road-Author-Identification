				I signed up on Coinbase six days ago. Their policy is, you must wait four days after verifying your bank account and placing a BTC order for you to receive the bitcoin. Before you place an order you must verify your bank account. To do this, they send two small amounts of money to your bank and once you&#039;ve received each of them, you must type the exact amount on the Coinbase website.<br /><br />I figured out almost exactly how much bitcoin I could order with the amount of money I had in the account, then placed the order. Four days later, I&#039;ve been charged $25 and never received any bitcoin. Coinbase withdrew the 2 small payments from my account without notice, the day before I was supposed to receive the bitcoin. Now I have less money in the account than the payment, and have been charged $25 by my bank because I would have gone negative.<br /><br />I&#039;ve sent an email to Coinbase. I wish they had a phone number.<br /><br />WHAT DO I DO?! I cannot be charged $25, and on top of that I need my bitcoin TODAY!!

				I don&#039;t know if you have any idea what bitcoin fluctuations are....but bitcoin changes price. Quite frequently I might add. You obviously aren&#039;t a brilliant mathematician so lets cut to the chase.....you overdrew your own account at your own doing. <br /><br />Don&#039;t discredit a legitimate business because you don&#039;t know how the interwebz works brotha.<br />I personally love coinbase.&nbsp; ;D

				Why use coinbase? were you getting A LOT of coins? I see sellers selling at, below or slightly above rates on lbc.com and you have them less than a hour in most cases. <br />
