				Wow, I am just looking at Mt. Gox right now, and currently it is at $10.75619. Last time I checked it was just over $8.8. Is it typical for it to go so high? Also, do vendors ever consider this in their prices? Or do things somehow level out for us, the buyers?&nbsp; This shit is outrageous. <br /><br />And before someone says it, yes.. it is the nature of the beast. I was just a little thrown off when I checked.

				the answer to all your questions is yes. Price has been as high as 30 something dollars if im not mistaken, and as dipped up and down very frequently. wait till it peaks over 12 or 13 and it will begin a couple months of dropping. buy massive amounts when it drops then profit when it rises again ;)

I do web design &amp; SEO... though I am not sure why that is relevant...&nbsp;

				I wonder though, if one can actually make some decent coin just letting it sit... <br /><br /><br />Oh hey Limetless... I had to have my PIN reset last Saturday, not sure of the exact time.. could you please let me know how it is reset. I mean, when the time is up I know that I reply to a message sent by support, but do I just log out and then back in? <br /><br /><br />=D I&#039;m loving this place. So many nice people who actually advise you of what not to do. And support that really looks out for ya. Not kissing ass either, its wicked nice of &#039;em.
