				******EDIT: OOPS! i thought i was in the Off Topic subforum, thanks for pointing that out. I&#039;ve requested a move from a moderator.<br /><br />i feel like i&#039;m missing something herebecause i just saw an interview in this documentary with a guy that get&#039;s pure ket from india for $10 a gram off clearnet and i just paid ten times that for a us listing here on SR. i just wanted to say &quot;wow.&quot; I just hope it&#039;s pure because i use MXE with therapeutic intent and i&#039;m looking for something with a shorter duration of effects. <br />the show seems like a smear piece, it&#039;s not obnoxiously so but i&#039;m a little offended because i believe that these drugs have a certain value for people that struggle to control and enjoy recreational substance use. my experience with mxe hasn&#039;t been &#039;hey, whoa! i&#039;ve got to do this all the time!&#039;<br />it&#039;s almost always returned me to a rational perspective on what my goals are and compells me to take an honest look at whatever it is i&#039;m doing in life and what parts are worth it and what aren&#039;t. plus the afterglow is great. plus they mention in the film that it&#039;s almost impossible to die from a ketamine overdose and the biggest problem (where have we seen this before?) is people cutting the product or lacking education about what they&#039;re taking.<br /><br />

				Times have changed and so have drug prices. Prices are more on SR because you are having the convenience of it sent to your front doorstep with better stealth and not sent from a flagged country

				i consider the overall expense of this system of trafficking to be worth it in that i have to plan, i don&#039;t have instant and unlimited access. i wouldn&#039;t even consider real life versions of most of my SR business and there is a lot of drama instantly avoided that comes with the separation of shopping from and enjoying drugs with people.

				It is certainly worth a premium price as a customer to have access to the finest quality of many different types of drugs, without having to know the right contacts in real life and maintain those relationships, which can be a lot more effort if possible at all.&nbsp; The feedback system certainly works well to make you comfortable ordering from strangers by looking at their track record.&nbsp; I can also see how, for a vendor, it would be a lot less stress to sell here than to sell in real life since the vendor can stay anonymous here.&nbsp; Win-win for everyone.<br /><br />I like a lot of those NatGeo Drugs Inc episodes but many of them are flawed.&nbsp; There was a ketamine episode, I don&#039;t recall if it is the one mentioned here because I think ketamine was featured on more than one episode, but in this episode the user was shooting up ketamine and they did most of the interviewing about the experience while he was high.&nbsp; So, he naturally was pretty out of it and didn&#039;t explain things in the most coherent way, so it painted him in a more negative light.
