				Hey every1 wants up?<br /><br />I just purchased the new Ipod Touch 4th Generation, 32GB. I know its not really related to SR but this machine is really amazing and I just wanted to share. <br /><br />I have had several Ipods in the past but this one is amazing. It is basically a mini I tablet. It comes with a good camera, it can take HD video in good quality, it can hold tons of songs, it has the same types of apps and games offered on an Iphone also. Now my phone is an Android but I have noticed that the Ipod apps are much better. There are also alot of free apps which is really cool.<br /><br />One my my favorite things about the new Ipod touch is that it has wifi. The new Ipod touch is perfect for watching movies, listening to music, playing games, and even doing productive things using the apps.<br /><br />Since it has wifi you can also use it for navigation purposes but its not that great unless you can be mobile while maintaining a wifi connection.<br /><br />But one of the downsides is music prices. Since the Ipod makes it so easy to listen to music, watch videos, tv shows, and play games you will need to budget alot of money to pay for these things. I was looking at a few songs and they seem pretty expensive, around $0.99 each. If I was buying just a few that wouldnt be bad but I want to buy like a 1000. I want my favorite tv shows like South Park and Two and a Half Men by the season. I want new movies at affordable prices! I also found around 40 games I want plus at least 100 apps. When all was said and done I calculated that the media cost for my $320 Ipod was going to far out weigh the actual cost of the Ipod, which I consider to be very expensive.<br /><br />I would really like it if some other users could post good sites for getting free Ipod apps, music, videos, and games. I am going to try PirateBay but this will be the first time I have ever used PirateBay for music. In the past I have had mixed results with PirateBay.<br /><br />The cheapest Ipod Touch 4th generation is the 8GB that cost $199 before tax and shipping. In the past I have owned 8GB Ipods and found them to be plenty big but with all the options now adays I am worried that a 32GB might not even be big enough. If you can afford a 64GB I would recommend buying it.<br /><br />Here are the prices from Apple, 8GB Ipod Touch $199, 32GB Ipod Touch $299, 64GB Ipod Touch $399. <br /><br />For a college student an Ipod is probably the 2nd best purchase you can make after a high quality laptop.<br /><br />If I could afford the Iphone I would purchase that because the Iphone is basically the Ipod touch with phone capabilities. But the downside of the Iphone is that if you are purchasing just one line you should expect to pay around $100 per month. If you can convince your family to convert to Iphones than you should be able to find a decent family plan for around $200 a month.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone who was thinking about purchasing an Ipod touch. For those of you who havent had the opportunity to use an Ipod touch I highly recommend this machine. If you enjoy technolgy then you will enjoy all that the Ipod has to offer.

				Damn it I thought you were selling one! :P<br /><br />That&#039;s awesome though, I need a new iPod bad! I have a 1st Gen iTouch and it fucking sucks. It actually SKIPS, it freezes and shuts off constantly, the Power and Volume buttons don&#039;t work anymore, it lags like a son of a bitch, I could go on..<br />Lol but I&#039;ve been hoping to get a good deal on a 3rd or 4th Gen iTouch.<br /><br />Steve Jobs would probably be happy to know you approve of his product! Haha :D

				KingJoey,<br /><br />I too have an Ipod touch 4 generation and i FUCKING LOVE IT! Apple definitely knows what they are doing. I HIGHLY recommend you Jailbreak it. I jailbroke mine with greenpoison originally, but it was very glitchy so I restored it and re-did it with redsn0w. In my opinion, the Jailbreak makes the ipod 20 million times better, since it gives you cydia which gives you access to a lot of sick customizing apps and such. You can also download installous through cydia, which allows you to download pretty much all apps FOR FREE!!!<br /><br />I love my ipod, but I have loved it even more since I jailbroke it. I also have the 64 gb so I have a retarded amount of apps, games(including games from n64, snes, sega and other gaming systems played through emulators!!!) and music and its not even half full :) <br /><br />I repeat, the jailbreak is soooooooooo worth it. You should look into it. there is a wealth of information about it out there. Just like with everything, do your research and make sure you know what you are doing when you decide to take the plunge.<br /><br />Oh you will have to restore the Ipod when you jailbreak it, so back up your info somehow if you decide to do it..<br /><br />Ihatebusinessorgz

				Why did you even bother getting one? you do know the government can track you, and all the pictures you take have the location data on it..<br />also i cant believe you actually contemplated BUYING music and tv shows, only idiots pay for that shit, download utorrent and start downloading torrents from tpb. <br />some music may not be on there, so i use youtube-mp3.org to get the songs off youtube.

However, as much as I FUCKING HATE the government, i highly doubt that those fuckers care enough to track my location.... I know they probably have better things to do (well, at least i&#039;m hoping so...) <br /><br />With regards to the pictures, yes that is true. But it is also true that you can strip the data off the pictures. You just have to know how to do it. I would usually never post a picture unless I am certain that the data has been taken off. People should fucking do the same. And even if the government gets into my Ipod, I could give half a shit if they see the location of where I took the pictures. If they were getting into my ipod, they would already know where I live and everything else about me, so WHO CARES???<br /><br />I balance the utility I get out of my ipod with the likelihood that that the government will use it to track me. Also, the same can be applied to cellphones, and everyone has one nowdays.. are you telling me that you don&#039;t have one? because that would be amazing. If that is the case, more power to you drugsbunny. <br /><br />But I do agree with you. The apps, the music and movies can and should be obtained for free. Fuck giving apple (or whoever makes money off that shit) the money they ask for that stuff when it can be procured for freeeee :P<br /><br />Getting back on topic, ipods rule. but they pwn when jailbroken.<br />laters

				I have located tracking devices for a living for a short period of time. Based on my experience I would say the two ways to track an Ipod 4th generation would be the gps unit and if it is active any time a picture is taken with the Ipod the Ipod imbeds the gps location within the picture so people with knowledge of how to get the GPS coords from your pictures can locate you.<br /><br />I actually wanted to make a post warning sellers on SR not to post pictures of thier products using smart phones because new smart phone cameras also embed the gps location within the picture.<br /><br />Drugsbunny, I suggest you use your enormous brain and omniscient capabilities to more constructively instruct others or simply make fun of them and keep it to yourself. I dont know what your goal was with your post but I can assure you that any audience that you may have will be more receptive of your messages if you present them in a different way. <br /><br />PS - Why did you bother getting a computer. You do know the government can track you right? All that it takes to track anything is a simple device that omits some kind of RF signal. Anything you have could be being tracked right now. Additionally all of your spoken communication can easily be monitored by the government. Maybe you can construct a custom home and instruct the contractor to install copper mesh throughout all of the walls/roof and depending on your altitude and location maybe even your floors. That way RF signals cannot penetrate your personal space. <br /><br />ihatebusinessorgz - Thanks for the great advice. I will look into jail breaking it and I am glad that you gave specific information that will be useful.<br /><br />PriscillaMarie90 - I actually do have another 64GB 4th generation that&#039;s sealed in the box. I didn&#039;t actually pay retail for my 32GB or the 64GB I obtained both of them with intentions of selling them. But my good friend came over with her Ipod and showed me all the things that it was capable of and the next thing I knew I had opened the 32GB one lol. I wish I knew you better because I would work a deal for the 64GB one out with you. But since I don&#039;t have a sellers account there isn&#039;t a safe way we can do the sale. Since E Bay and Amazon.com banned me for selling pipes and other &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; I cant even offer to open an auction for you. But just so you know they are cheaper for a new one on E Bay than you can buy from Apple. So I suggest if you want one and wanna save around $50-$60 buy it from E Bay instead of Apple.<br /><br />Right now I have been trying to sell the 64GB one on Craigslist and these people all must think I got it for free cause the highest offer I got yet for my NIB 64GB Ipod was $150 lol. I considered the buyer to be very optimistic haha. <br /><br />

				OK... remove the tinfoil hats there buddies.<br />iPod 4th Gen does NOT have GPS.&nbsp; The only location data it can figure out is through Wi-Fi, and that is terribly inefficient.<br />Still scrub the metadata off your pictures before posting, if you decide to use it to take pictures for SR.<br /><br />Yes, if you jailbreak you can do much more, as far as getting apps for free, etc.<br />For music and video, most things you can just drop into iTunes to convert it, and then sync.&nbsp; Some stuff you still have to convert before importing into iTunes so it will have the right aspect ratio and codec for the iPod/iPhone.<br /><br />$.99 a song isn&#039;t that bad, that&#039;s around $9.99 per album, and if you get an album you will save.&nbsp; You can even find compilation albums with a variety of artists/songs.&nbsp; iTunes is one of the few services that I actually pay for, now and again, as I like to feed the artists I love.<br /><br />I actually worked in the film industry for awhile, and they truly earn their paycheques.&nbsp; You work 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week, in a strange town/city for a short duration, then you either move onto another project (if you&#039;re lucky) or spend the next three months looking for a job.&nbsp; It is far from stable, and your knowledge is very specialized and doesn&#039;t transfer well to other industries.&nbsp; I used to call us, well-paid carnies.&nbsp; Most of my friends are still slugging away at it, but I&#039;ve gotten out as I actually know a thing or two about computers and have managed to get a job.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been flip/flopping in and out over the years, and I&#039;m finally done with the entertainment industry... too many ungrateful souls tugging at the bottom line.
