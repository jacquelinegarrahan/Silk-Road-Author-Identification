				Some sites state LSD, others more sketchily state &#039;A potent new form of LSD&#039;. <br /><br />My first thoughts on reading were &#039;Man I gotta get me some of that.&#039; Silkroad, what have you turned me into?<br /><br />But then I started thinking how I much I feel like NOT biting someones face off whilst tripping. I&#039;ve never had a bad trip, but I have thought about how it&#039;d feel. But the overwhelming euphoric feeling I get would surely negate any desires of face chomping. <br /><br />IMO, it&#039;s either a research chemical based on LSD, or a pure fabrication by the media. When I first saw the story developing I jokingly said &#039;ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE&#039; but - all your high people will agree with me, sober... not so much - if there were a zombie virus, the government would most definitely cover it up. And would most definitely pin that sort of behavior on drugs to bolster their war. (I don&#039;t actually believe this, but it&#039;s fun to entertain the thought nonetheless). <br /><br />What are your opinions? LSD or analogue?<br /><br />

				PCP involved in that in some way or another, maybe some new RC similar to PCP as the entire description makes complete sense for someone freaking out on PCP, but on LSD? Good luck getting me off the couch let alone motivated enough to chase a guy down a highway and eat his face off. Plus the article I read said he ate 80% of his face, LSD curbs my appetite quite a bit, I could probably only stomach 15% of a face tops.

				Gotta agree with Meister on this one. It most likely was PCP or 3-MeO-PCP. LSD makes you hallucinate and think some very odd things sometimes, but never would it cause an individual to do such a gross and horrifying thing like that. Common sense doesn&#039;t go out the window on Lucy. For all we know too, this man could have had a severe mental illness that in conjunction with a chem like PCP, made a chaotic combo.

				If you guys would read the other thread currently discussing this, you&#039;d know it was a form of bath salts which probably caused the man to develop psychosis. :P

It&#039;s near impossible to OD on it, it&#039;s been proven to have therapeutic uses and it heals the soul. It&#039;s the media who made my teen life so difficult. My family constantly gave me shit about my drug use based on common stereotypes the media has brought forward over the years.
