				Hi all - I am shopping for a vaporizer but after reading several reviews I am still unsure.&nbsp; Some of the reviews I feel are nothing more than marketing in disguise of someones opinion.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there must be some good feedback here from our user base.&nbsp; The top two seem to be the Volcano and Extreme Q.&nbsp; Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

				If you have the money, volcano is the industry standard.&nbsp; If you need portable, Pax is the best.<br /><br />Personally, there&#039;s just a limit I would pay for a heating coil. <br /><br />I recommend getting the Magic Flight Box or Vapir off ebay for ~$90 with free shipping.&nbsp; The only thing with these is that the chamber is not as large, so it&#039;s more for individual toking sessions.&nbsp;

				If your looking for portable, I&#039;d suggest getting an ecig and using it with BHO or CO2. Ecigs are much cheaper than products made specifically for cannabis. You can get one for around $40 or so.

				Have you tried vaporizing before? as you may or may not like it.<br /><br />If not I would suggest a cheap $10 glass vap before spending the cash<br /><br />If you are looking for something cheap and portable vaporgenie or magicflightbox<br /><br />If you want a desktop vap and got the cash volcano or silver surfer.

				Sorry I guess I should have been more clear.&nbsp; I already own the Pax and while nice it has a really hard drag and my significant other does not like it.&nbsp; So we are looking to shell out some money on a good non-portable unit.&nbsp; I had my eye on one for about $250 but then I thought what if that sucks and I have to shell out another 500 for a volcano.&nbsp; I thought who better to ask than all you like minded people who I know aren&#039;t trying to market something to me.

I also have friends who use prefilled cartridges that you can use with your ecig, though I&#039;ve never had one. Sorry, I don&#039;t have specific voltage/resistance info on the coils for you.
