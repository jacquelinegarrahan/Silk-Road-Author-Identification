				Iduno what size caps you have but I like to use 00 size because they are easier to fill. Assuming you have a scale. I would get a plate (black dinner plate) place the scale on that to make sure to collect fallen crystals. A playing card, i would fold that in half the long way to look like a V. something scoopy, i used a stainless steel knife or a butter knife to, to scoop from the bag onto the scale.<br />once you got all those:<br />1. weigh out desired amount<br />2. put it on the card and funnel it into the cap, and gently flick it to get as much off as you can<br />3. CAP. done. repeat<br /><br />I open the caps before hand and line them up it makes it faster. wear gloves too, because if you got soft sensitive moist skin, thats bad for the caps, and leaves finger prints<br />and if it gets in your eye, you WILL die<br /><br /><br />that&#039;s how i do it at least, maybe it&#039;s ghetto and there&#039;s easier ways.

				You could buy a capsule machine online.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend buying it in a friend&#039;s name. Maybe a friend you don&#039;t exactly care for.

				If you&#039;d like a more pleasant scooping experience, use scoopulas or scoops that hold small amounts -- actual chemistry equipment designed for powders like this. I&#039;ve also heard good things about the Capsule Machine.

				I do pretty much the same thing as meowflakes except I use a folded receipt as a catcher and instead of scooping stuff out of a bag I dump all my product onto a colored plate and push the crystals off the plate onto the receipt. This allows me to separate out piles and really control how much I add to the scale, meaning I pretty much never overshoot the weights Im aiming for. 00&#039;s are the best for capping stuff out.

				ive only seen it done with a small fillet type knife. its like an inch long kitchen blade. i actually have one and my buddy has two, so they are common house knives.<br /><br />any how, just stick that in the bag and pull out some on the tip of the knife and insert that into the cap and eye ball, re-weigh until correct amount.<br /><br />i have no idea what size the caps are.<br /><br />the capsule machine confuses me to be honest.....how can you fill your caps and know each one is going to be .1 ??

				The barrel of a 1 mL plastic syringe will fit inside of a 00 cap. Cut off the end of the syringe that the needle attaches to so that you have an open barrel. Pull back the plunger to a specific volume mark and tap the end of the syringe into a pile of molly crystals until the syringe barrel is full from the plunger to the open end of the syringe. Put the open end of the syringe into the cap and press out the powder with the plunger.&nbsp; Do an experiment to see what volume mark gives you the amount of weight you&#039;re looking for; you&#039;ll surprised at how reproducible this is if you take even a little bit of care (mostly in how tightly you pack the syringe). This method works great and is MUCH faster than weighing out and adjusting each dose individually.

				there is a much easier way involving figuring out how much an empty capsule weighs and weighing your product in the capsule...my size 3&#039;s weigh .045 and size 4&#039;s weigh .41.... the smaller the caps are the more you can fit in small places :) I could not imagine scaling out each dose and then putting that into a cap afterwords, I just do it all at once. Eventually your eye will be as accurate as the scale!

				Wait, I think I have been looking at this all wrong. The best way to cap molly is fill the entire cap to the brim. This way you know your doses will be equal, and you are sure to have lots of fun.

				This is how I&#039;ve done it, good with a decent amount around 5 - 6g. When I want 100mg or so per cap then I buy #3 capsules. These can typically hold 175-200mg at max capacity.<br /><br />&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Weigh out however much you want with your scale. Easy right?<br /><br />&nbsp;2. Crush it up a bit so none of the chunks are larger than the opening of your capsule.<br /><br />&nbsp;3. Tare your scale with 1 capsule on it. I have found a #3 weighs approx .04.<br /><br />&nbsp;4. Open your capsule and take a paper business card and just start scooping your E into the capsule with the business card and fill 1/2 way.<br /><br />&nbsp;5. Quickly throw it on the scale to see if its roughly .14, if its a bit above or below its fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;6. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />Once you are finished count your capsules. If you have 50 and you initially weighed out 5 grams you are spot on. Give yourself a pat on the back and go have some fun. <br /><br />I can typically do 5g in about 20 minutes this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;
