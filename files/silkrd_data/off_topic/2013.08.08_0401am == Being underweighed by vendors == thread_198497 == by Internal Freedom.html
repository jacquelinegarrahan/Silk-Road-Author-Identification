				I have the pleasure of owning a milligram scale, so it has become a habit of mine to weigh everything I buy off SR upon receiving it. Over the last few months Ive noticed most of my orders are under what they should be. Getting 0.9 instead of 1 of DMT (Losing about $13 worth),&nbsp; 3.2 instead of 3.5 for MDMA. It varies from time to time.<br /><br />I ordered off a new vendor a week or two ago. He had around 40-50 transactions and I thought I would give the guy a shot. Not only did my order take twice as long as it should of to arrive, but he also didn&#039;t ship it until 6 days after I placed my order (Even though he marked it in transit the day after). I know this because he messaged me asking to FE then responded saying I didn&#039;t have to and that my order was being shipped.<br /><br />Now, it finally arrived early today. I open the letter and see a few nice rocks with no smell (mdma usually smells strongly). Also, the fucker gave me 0.74 instead of a full gram. He&#039;s a new vendor and needs all the rep he can get, and he fucking under weighs me a quarter gram. Im going to message him when SR gets back online and see what the hell is going on. There is NONE stuck to the bag so there&#039;s no excuse there.<br /><br />I&#039;m just tired of being under-weighed by these fucking vendors, I pay for this shit and I expect to get what I pay for.

				I once made a purchase of a substance in powder form.<br />But then I realized, shit, I don&#039;t have a scale. Took it on faith.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about that skimming, mate.

				Have you calibrated your scales?&nbsp; Scales need to be calibrated regularly.<br />Maybe yours or the vendors is off.<br />

				I agree with novocaine, check that, mate.<br /><br />In my experience vendors have given me what I pay for, maybe 50 mg under tops, but usually over if anything. <br />If my order was more then 100 mg under I would not leave 5/5 and ask for reparations. If vendors want to undercut then tell them to fuck off back to the streets.

				Being underweighed sucks. I used to think that only happens in real life. On here, most of the time its always been over or even: Nbome tabs always right,weed qp over by 8 grams,weed oz over by 2 grams or this last time it was over by only.13 grams, m1 usually over alot 55 grams on a 50 gram purchase was the last one,mdma pills i never bought bulk but they are always right on and not broken or anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;you should call the vendors out on it after you calibrate your scale if it is still under. If someone advertises a oz then they need to ship at least the whole oz and maybe then some. Personally i dont go back to someone that is even on my products because there are other vendors who throw in extra!

				Yes, make sure your scale is calibrated correctly. If it is would just ask my vendor politely if he wants to resolve that issue. 0.74/1 is really below the margin I would ignore.<br /><br />Vendors are human too, might have been an error. I personally never received underweighed.

				I don&#039;t sell anything these days but I used to back in the day. I would always weigh heavy by 1/10, regardless the weight or product. The few hundred dollars you lose doing this is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars you&#039;ll use if people think they are getting ripped off and stop using you. Plus when their bags are always heavy they love it and always come back. Try to find me a drug dealer on the streets these days that will give you 31grams when you order an ounce. Silk Road vendors that are professionals and know what they are doing will always give you a little bit over. If they&#039;re knickel and diming you for a .1 I&#039;d look to find a new vendor.

I fully re-calibrated my scale a few days ago when I was under-weighed yet again by a vendor. I also own two scales, a two digit (0.00) and the MG scale. On my other scale it came up as 0.78, and on my MG it came up as 0.745<br /><br />I messaged him today, no response yet. I think I would let it slide at around 0.9+ but this is way too low.

				Be aware, those $20-$50 milligram scales are not even close to milligram accuracy.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to come across some precision engineering scales from a company that replaces all their scales each year.&nbsp; I&#039;ve compared those with the set of cheapo milligram scales I was using before I got them, a 10% difference between the 2 is not uncommon.
