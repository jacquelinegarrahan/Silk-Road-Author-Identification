When it&#039;s time to sleep, I ensure there&#039;s a big bottle of water next to me, I have a big glass of it before I drift off, and drink more if I wake up through the night, dehydration is a bitch! When I wake first thing I do is drink a glass of freshly squeezed OJ as Vitamin C is very helpful. Eating a diet high in mineral rich fish is also a good idea, and bouillon soup works wonders too, has it&#039;s very easy to digest and is full of vitamins and minerals, very beneficial for speeding up recovery. I love to party hard, but post party I try to take positive steps, it makes my hangover a lot more bearable. Find out from someone who knows what happened at the bar last night, if it was something really bad apologise sincerely, if they don&#039;t let you back in, put it down to experience, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find a better bar to go to. Mostly I party at home, I don&#039;t like being off my head in the great outdoors lol! All the best for a quick recovery :)

				A sleepless night on an overdose of 2C-X and some MDMA will do that to you. It&#039;s a good idea to keep stuff like that on hand, stuff is worth it&#039;s weight in gold around here.

Any other tips? :0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Tadalafil also known as le weekender, acts faster, works much longer in most cases. In terms of viagra, some don&#039;t get on with the tablets, but will get on with the jellies, if your using generics some prefer one to the other (there&#039;s so many variants, and I&#039;m no expert, but my guess some are synthesised better than others). Try to help him out by making an effort, make the room relaxing, use a nice room spray, warm sweet scents like vanilla and amber work well, candles, whatever you&#039;d think he&#039;d like, stimulate his mind by whispering sweet nothings or dirty talk (whatever he prefers), and lots of foreplay, &#039;cokedick&#039; can be psychological, making him relaxed and loose himself in it, might help him rise to the occasion! A few words of advice from my experience, hope they help you ;)

Whenever I´ve tired pureish coke. FM kinda stuff i´ve never had a problem sleeping. Whenever I get it from the gaff or street it always makes me wired.

Suggest higher quality shit or if wizz dick is a problem just go for lots of oral and/or kinky shit.
