				Am I the only one that thinks this guy is a fucking retard, as well as a phoney. I mean every time something happens this fucking idiot just automatically says it was the government. Now I just want to say that there are some conspiracy theories that I believe in, and I hate the US govt, but this guy just leads blind sheep that actually are looking for non-MSM, but are too stupid to see that all he wants is his ca$h

				He&#039;s way too passionate to only be in it for the cash but i totally agree he can be an asshole and is way over the top.<br />He happens to make a good living, i read an article the other week on him that said &quot;he&#039;s in the business of fear and business is booming&quot; <br />I also believe in some theories, 9/11 obviously, but some others too but AJ over does it quite often.

Like when ever he is wrong/pissed he just screams/talks over the other person - like good ol&#039; Bill O&#039;reilly. Also this guy is trying to say muslims control hollywood, I dont think I even need to say that its obvious the jews run hollywood, that much everyone knows. But he never points his finger at the jews for some reason (oh yeah his wife is a jew)

				I&#039;ve only just picked up on this guy. It sees he has a lot of bad press mainly from alternative thinkers/conspiracy believers. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have enough experience of him to have an opinion of whether he is a shill or a retard. I will say that I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s a good thing having more people like Alex Jones, a popular channel on a site that reaches millions of people, telling joe public about false flags and government lies and yadda yadda. I think it&#039;s just another form of brainwashing by the government/media. Fill the people&#039;s heads with SO MUCH conspiracy information that the real truth gets buried in a million and one other theories which range from sensible to ridiculous.<br /><br />I think the latter is the case. Hide everything in plain site...<br /><br /><br />jackofspades: Passion = good cocaine ;)
