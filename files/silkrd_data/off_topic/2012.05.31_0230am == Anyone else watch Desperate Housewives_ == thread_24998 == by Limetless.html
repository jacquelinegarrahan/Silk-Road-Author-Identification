				And a) think Eva Longoria is FITTEST milf since time began.<br /><br />Or b) think that her kid Juanita is one of the fattest little Umpa-Lumpas on tv? I just want to roll that little munchkin down a bloody hill. <br /><br />And finally c) you think that Ginger&#039;un would be a great fuck.<br /><br />I subscribe to all 3 points of view.

				my old lady loves that shit so every sunday me and whoever else is at my house is forced to watch it. its been going on so long i actually know the general plot and the fuckers names n shit. to bad it didnt end with a bang like where they had a blood orgy and then bree would do a murder- suicide and burn the house with everyones body in it by letting her cookies in the oven burn. either way im just glad my sundays are a little easier to deal with. now if fucking grays anatomy would end my life would be smooth sailing lol.<br />
