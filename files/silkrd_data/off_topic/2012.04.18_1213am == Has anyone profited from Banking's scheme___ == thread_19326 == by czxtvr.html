				hah he&#039;s recruiting mules. probably is profit in it but you better know what you&#039;re doing because the Secret Service investigating bank fraud will come after you not him. be sure you yank the SIM card from the phone when not in use so it&#039;s not broadcasting your location to towers everywhere when they trace fraud<br /><br />they busted a huge calling ring in Belarus last year who were answering paypal, credit card and bank verification calls with english speakers. they advertised on every carding forum

				Banking is legit, I have been working for him for a few weeks now and have profited.<br /><br />His first concern has been my safety and his knowledge of VOIP and Cryptography is extremely impressive. The only qualifications you need are to be computer literate and a native speaker of English - he&#039;s an honest man and a forthright friend.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend people message him and ask for more information. If you decide it&#039;s not for you, you can always say no thank you, no harm done!<br /><br />V.

				Thanks Vlad, all catches on the fly, no stupid questions, mutual opinion, I hope to find more partners like him.<br /><br />eradicat0r , seems that you know what you are talking about, but as I see, you don&#039;t know all aspects of this work.

				I asked for info and the faq was so vague about the actual work was that I figured it must be way riskier than what i already do here, and for less money (at least to start)

				brutusk - When you talk about the risks, you do not take into account the technical details, as far as I know, we have never discussed this details. <br />Yes, I love Hollywood too, everything is described nicely , but we are in real life, and these cool tricks to intercept a call for a minute, is not quite what it actually is. <br />But the most important thing is that where we call, they are not waiting for your call to that track, we call in the usual normal people, shops and banks, not the government. or kind of places.<br />Most importantly, (there will not be, but) even if there is interest of call, it will be some time later, a call has a track is not real after days, weeks, months. <br />But as I said earlier, no interest will be, this is not the money that excite interest.

If you want to know more information about the kind of calls you are placing and how much you&#039;ll get, I would suggest sending him a message.<br /><br />The work is fairly easy, although you will need some basic computer literacy in order to communicate both with him and the people you&#039;re calling safely. Calls are placed in such a way that it would be close to impossible to track them, and as Banking says for the kind of money we&#039;re talking about the NSA/Secret Service would not be interested in pursuing the case.<br /><br />Anyone who has read my previous posts will know that I take a very keen interest in privacy and encryption in general and I have already mentioned I am extremely impressed by his regard for my safety and his own.<br /><br />My advice to anyone who wants to know exactly what&#039;s involved is to send Banking a message to find out more. The money I have earned from working with him for less than one week has already earned me enough to set up a seller&#039;s account on Silk Road with money to spare.<br /><br />V.

				Oh wow, and if, he received the money in the first week of work and after some time a little more. What do you think respected detective, can it be this way also?<br />(This is rhetorical question, the answer is obvious and does not require the regular stress of the mind)
