				Anybody know how reliable intersango really is? I heard they were not answering emails recently and also that peoples money has not been going through correctly or at all. Can anyone who uses intersango clarify any of this or let us know? THANKS

				Seems to be one way only at the moment, money can go in from uk and bitcoins go out ok, but transfers of cash to uk banks are still not happening.

				Has anyone managed to make a deposit through the Metro Bank to buy coins successfully? There isn&#039;t a Metro Bank near me and I think it would a few days for the deposit to go through if I done it at a different bank.

				I got a reply from them 2 days ago stating they were having troubles with Lloyds bank transfers and said it should be fixed by Thursday. Got my money through on Wednesday, and have since collected my bitcoins. So I am assuming all problems are sorted.<br /><br />I&#039;ve browsed about for places to get bitcoins from, and so far Intersango seems to be the easiest for someone in the U.K.
