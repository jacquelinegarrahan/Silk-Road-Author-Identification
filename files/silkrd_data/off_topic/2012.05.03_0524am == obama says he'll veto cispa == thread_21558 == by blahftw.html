				WEll he is CIA (been an operator since he was a teenager), and since they grow the poppies and marijuana in Afghanistan and sell it on SR, I would imagine he would keep CISPA down.

				blahftw,<br /><br />Not saying you&#039;re wrong or anything like that, but we have to keep in mind what a politician says they&#039;ll do and what they actually do are very different things. With election season well on it&#039;s way, politicians need to ramp up their sophism and ensure they get their votes they need to stay in office/get bloody rich. If he vetoes it, some Republicans and Democrats will say he doesn&#039;t value security on the spooky internet and supports terrorism, if he passes it though, the same Republicans and Democrats will say he doesn&#039; value freedom. Politics is awesome

				yeah, it&#039;s all bullshit.&nbsp; but there&#039;s no harm in signing it.&nbsp; the attitude that government is gonna do what it wants anyway is what has gotten us into this mess.&nbsp; if we had listened to the second ammendment, and kept a well organized militia, maybe we wouldn&#039;t be in this mess.&nbsp; but that&#039;s a whole nother rant.

				This would not be the first time Obama (and many other presidents) have promised to veto draconian legislation and then signed it anyway.

				It isn&#039;t really a matter of organized militia, it&#039;s more an issue of our fourth amendment rights which have been under a fair deal of attack lately. Whether it&#039;s CISPA or the TSA, it seems like our right to privacy is nothing more than a suggestion. If we really ever wanted to ensure our rights remain wholly intact, we need to ensure that corporate money stays out of our democratic-republic. They do not work for you or I anymore, they work for their lists of special interests groups. An organized militia would be cool I suppose, but I&#039;d much rather have a well-informed voting populace and a government that works for us, not for Exxon, Pepsi, Apple, Hollywood and the list goes on and on.
