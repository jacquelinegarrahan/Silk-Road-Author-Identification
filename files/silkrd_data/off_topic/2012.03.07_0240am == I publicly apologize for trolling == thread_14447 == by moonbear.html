				For some reason I have to point out that as a forum moderator I always find it totally amusing that Sir Moonbear (Knight Of The Realm) always posts in the correct place so that I never have to move his posts, which is way more than I can say about a lot of people!!

				I&#039;m happy to hear it sound as though you have used a psychedelic as a tool. lest you not forget about moderation either. if your forum posts are any indication of the amount of drugs you are taking, it sounds like you&#039;ve been abusing your body, which is even worse on a teenage body, if that fact is true. good luck in your future journeys and decisions.

				Does the Silk Road, as a community, provide any help for people who become unhinged or trapped in a destructive cycle of substance abuse? The basic security model probably prevents direct intervention but perhaps some kind of community monitoring and reporting could be worked out. Would vendors voluntarily refrain from selling to people with a problem? Perhaps that could be incorporated into the vendor rating system.

				PM sent. well your not exactly discrete are you...<br /><br />i dont know man. maybe its just a really really elaborate troll. but i doubt it because the account has allot of friends, a girlfriend is around your age range (which i believe to be closer to 14- not 16) and sounds like you to be honest...<br /><br />plus it reflects certain samples your recieved.<br /><br />just dont mind all that. deactivate your facebook profile and then look to get it deleted (message them for that). dont mind this new account, start a new one. dont ever mention moonbear. just seperate yourself from everything moonbear.<br /><br />
