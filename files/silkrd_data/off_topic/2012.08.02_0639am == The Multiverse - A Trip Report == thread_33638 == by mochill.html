				TL; DR below, but it&#039;s worth it.<br /><br />What a great place SR has to be that like-minded individuals just out for a great time congregate in this area, anonymous to each other but for the wisdom and experience each has shown. That we may &#039;sit&#039; together with our favorite drink, or smoke, or adulterant, and discuss the mundane and outrageous lives that each of us live in a world where the best fun in life is usually illegal.<br /><br />Hello reader, this is Mochill, and this is my trip report.<br /><br />I started the day knowing that the night ahead would be full of adventures. We&#039;d be having a night out at the bar, good drinks, good music, good people. It would be free flow Belvedere, Glen, and a good beer. Could be the stuff of legends, could be one hell of a hangover. It all...<br /><br />Starts…<br /><br />... with Work.<br /><br />Everyone&#039;s different, granted. But I think a majority of the world can agree that the start of their day is not exactly... ideal. You wake up - groggy, tired, hungry, thirsty, smelly, all of the above - and you center yourself. Just another day, just another digit in the overflowing stack of days you have in your mind.<br /><br />And then you remember, you have this new drug you want to try.<br /><br />It&#039;s a rather famous one, you know. Why don&#039;t I tell you? You can skip ahead if you&#039;d like to know the answer, but do indulge me. I can describe it as something that can be mild, is usually enjoyable, is in low doses, and most telling of all, can be taken possibly every week at most.<br /><br />What&#039;s your guess?<br /><br />2CB? <br /><br />Winner.<br /><br />The morning proceeds like any other. Change of clothes. Traffic. Haze of sleepiness and hunger. The office. A small world of you, your work, and nothing else.<br /><br />10mg (approximate) 2CB dosed orally at 10:00 AM, after a meal (expected come up 1+ hours)<br /><br />Get called into a meeting at 11:00AM. Go through the motions. Feel the shit kicking in at 11:30. Some nausea. Chills followed by a bout of heat. I sit through it knowing that it’s a new drug, it’s like MDMA and LSD but different, and that it’ll turn out awesome.<br /><br />Oh my thoughts they started racing. 12:15 oh god it’s only been 20 minutes? This is a really long meeting!<br /><br />It has begun.<br /><br />Fly through the rest of the meeting feeling like a rockstar. Free lunch zapped up like the best food in the world. Feel good but not as high as I imagined (wanted 20mg, you know the feel). 12.55 pm, still got lunch hour. And then I remembered.<br /><br />Weed (1/2 a standard bong bowl) <br /><br />A little joint I made last night with some good chill bud, mint rolling tobacco, a nice <br />metal rolling machine, and a very awesome wrapping paper. Mantra Strawberry paper, fuck yea.<br />Walked out of the office, down the street to a windy secluded corner (of a BANK, great place to smoke), and lit that sucker up. <br /><br />Woooooooo.<br /><br />10 minutes into the solo-joint (I make ‘em good), I am flying. It feels like I’m on MDMA, but a mellow kind of MDMA. No visuals, but pretty damn good for 10mg on a cheap $30 0.001 scale (Amazon it!). I feel my thoughts racing, I feel like my mind is finally able to think.<br /><br />1 beer and a cigarillo later, I’m back at work, sitting my ass down and enjoying this rather unique experience, letting you know just how fun drugs can be. Oh. I also wrote<br /><br />This:<br /><br />The Multiverse<br /><br />Humans have always wondered whether there were parallel worlds to ours; similar, but sometimes vastly different. What makes the world so different from the one we live in?<br /><br />You don&#039;t even have to look far. Every second of your waking life is pretty much a universe on its own.<br /><br />Look around you. Where are you? Take note of all the sounds and the scenery involved in your world. If you&#039;re like me, you&#039;ve also got a working job, probably in an office environment. Imagine yourself at a regular day at work just clocking in, plonking at the computer, have a coffee maybe, and just duke it out with life. Imagine the white lights, the symmetrical and orderly way the place is.<br /><br />And then you head out to lunch.<br /><br />The world outside your office is filled with the dozens of lives around you, sometimes hundreds, in rare cases thousands. Every person that is around you is a depository of memories, of experiences. You can almost imagine their brain - their recording camera - storing the images in front of them away, to be referred to at a later date or easily forgotten. Just another day. But there&#039;s so much life, so many sounds, but it&#039;s a little muted of course. It&#039;s just the semi-noisy bustle of a regular day at work. Or in the cases of the people around you, a regular day at college, the restaurant, whatever. You look at them and think, &#039;Hmm. What kind of life is that person living? Why and what is he doing now?<br /><br />You have your lunch, perhaps cozied up with a book or just devouring it for time and just because. The world around you doesn&#039;t really register. It&#039;s just you, lunch, and then back to work. Order something that you know you&#039;ll like and enjoy, a well balanced meal and a refreshing drink.<br /><br />Or you may be in a world of your own, created by the microcosm that is your friends who you eat with. Usually this will be in the numbers of four or more, because then the microcosm is big enough to notice. Think about it. You&#039;ve been in one of these microuniverses on your own. You must have. Just chatting away in your own shared memories, the experiences that - combined - form the basis of human consciousness.<br /><br />And then you step back into the office.<br /><br />A kind of reality check seeps in. Everything is quiet. Everyone is just working away at their individual stations in life. The air is clean and cool. You plonk yourself back down, sated, knowing there&#039;s just four more hours of this world before you transition to the next.<br /><br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this. I certainly did. And there’s still a night of debauchery to come.<br />_________________<br /><br />TL; DR <br />Mochill Trip Report<br />10:00am 10mg (approximate) 2C-B<br />1:00pm 1 joint (half bowl, approximate)<br />1:30pm 1 Heineken, and a cigarillo<br /><br />Verdict: Awesomeballs bitches, awesomeballs.<br />

				Woo, that was a seriously long day. Finally came down after all that by the time I went to the bar. Smoked another joint and then passed out at about 2AM from lack of energy. Crazy crazy day, I just felt so smart writing all that down. Would do it again with a better dose next time! Perhaps work needn&#039;t be so boring next time.

				nicely done mochill +1 for that entertaining bit of philosophy. I love philosophy over theology a million times to one. But you say we live in a subjective world so let me ask you if a tree falls in the woods and there is no living organisms around would it make the sound from falling? Does the tree even exist if there&#039;s nothing living around it. The universe is mental<br /><br />Why do theologians even bother with waking up? Surely they must truly know the real nature of the universe
