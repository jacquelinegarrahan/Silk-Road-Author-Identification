				Damn man I am so sorry to hear about this brother... I am only 20 my brother is 11 our mom died of cancer just a month and a half ago. She had stage 4 stomach cancer and suffered with it for 12 months, She was so depressed at first that all she did was lay in bed 24/7 and never leave the house until it got so bad her doctor admitted her to mental health. She lived there for a few weeks she was put on some drugs and came back home with a large drug filled plastic smile on her face( I&#039;m crying now because she hated that I called her that even though it was kind of true) she took chemo. got a second opinion, took more of a different kind of chemo and then her legs started to build up with fluid . Then came the rest of her body the tried to keep on draining it but it would just come back quicker till the point that she could not even get up on her own with out help then she stayed at the hospital a lot we could only go visit her so often because it was in Columbus and that is 3 hours away from us. Then she started to loose concentration and drift off even more .. Me being the unkind bastard I am pushed her until one night on the phone I yelled at her all night just because she was too tired to listen.She went into the ICU the next morning. The day after that she went to the hospice home where no matter how much I wanted to say I was sorry I could never get a response. She was diagnosed at age 41 and she died at age 42 on July 25th&nbsp; (11 days after my birthday I&#039;m not sure what significance that holds but I always remember that).. So what type and stage of cancer do you have? How long did those dumbass life projections doctors give you?(NEVER LISTEN TO THEM!). All I can say is man no matter how far down you feel Don&#039;t let this time slip away from you That is what me and my mom did and I regret it every single day... These are the moments that even if you don&#039;t want to you have to get up and do something, scratch that everything you ever wanted to do... fuck it if you don&#039;t have money I might send you some... Just do something man forgive that grudge you have been holding&nbsp; for years, Dance in the rain, have one last blow out psychedelic experience ( I recommend that one to everyone). Just do something. Life is a gift man live it Pax et Amor

I&#039;m very sorry you had to lose your mum like that, cancer is a terrible disease that has claimed the lives of a couple of people I&#039;ve known over my life, but no-one as close as a direct family member. I can&#039;t imagine to know what that would feel like to go through. We must cherish the time we have on this planet and the people we share our lives with because it can end unexpectedly at any moment.<br /><br />I gave you a +1 because you sound like a good person.
