				There are pretty much only 4 ways the feds can bring down SR or at the least hinder its operations. It looks like the feds could possible be attempting one of these strategies. at this very moment.<br /><br />1. Is bringing down the Tor network which is pretty much impossible for the DEA or any other NAZI LE agency to do on there own due to the vast complexity of the tor network.. Aliens might be able to though.<br /><br />2. Militarized the postal system. Having a permanent military occupation at all postal facilities along with expensive detection equipment. Arrest and brutal interrogations for anyone&nbsp; they deemed suspicious. Firing squads would also be present&nbsp; as a scare tactic. <br /><br />3. Attempt to regulate, manipulate, and contain the bitcoin economy. If they dont want to turn our country into a second NAZI Germany this strategy would be the best option.<br /><br />4. laissez faire - Do nothing. This s my favorite one. if states continue to end prohibition on marijuanan and other drugs in the furture. eventually&nbsp; The Silk Road will become obsolete. and the drug war will be over. sort of<br /><br />I believe the federal government is attempting to use the 3rd strategy in the United States. How are other countries handling the Silk Menace?

				This would be an incredibly labor-intensive feat that would require pumping tens of millions of dollars into the bitcoin economy. And lest you forget, bitcoins themselves aren&#039;t illegal, nor is their sole purpose to fund illegal activities. I just don&#039;t a fed crackdown all that likely, for both bitcoins and Tor.<br /><br />My guess is that the feds will attack this place from the ground up, posing as buyers/vendors and undermining the SR&#039;s sense of trust in one another. A few members here have suggested that this has already taken place, especially in Australia.
