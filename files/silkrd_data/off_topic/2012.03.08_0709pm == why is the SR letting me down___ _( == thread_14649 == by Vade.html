				I don&#039;t know how many times it has been said. There are no trusted vendors. Doesn&#039;t matter if they are Vendor number one, don&#039;t finalize early if you can&#039;t risk losing the money. <br />Hopefully it&#039;s just mail delays though, as that does happen from time to time. <br /><br />~Digi

				I trust all the vendors I buy from. But I don&#039;t trust what happens between the time it leaves their hands and gets to mine. I never finalize early. <br />Sellers should not push buyers to finalize early out of some kind of trust and mutual respect for one and other, nor make them feel guilty about it<br />Look after your money!
