				&nbsp;I was wondering if someone could enlighten me on the quickest way to buy BTC? I had been using dwola transfers from a bank account; however the delay to add money to dwola is around 4 days. This is very annoying and I am looking for a much quicker way. Is there a good way to buy some BTC with USD that is near instant? I have been thinking about buying some here on SR (such as from BTC King or the like) but the beginner&#039;s guide warns against it. Is BTC King or any other BTC vendor here on SR trust worthy? Thanks in advance!

				fuh-gedd-ah-boud-it<br /><br />If you&#039;re hassling BTC purchasing like that it almost always turns out bad one way or another.<br /><br />The only fast way, as in fast as you think of it, without using an offerer here on the site is get a UKash or Paysafe card, open a virvox account, buy linden dollars, get BTC.<br /><br />Which will amount to a loss of about 30 to 35%....screw that....but hey at least it&#039;s same day.<br /><br />Other than that, take your time, best to buy them with cash, that&#039;s the only really untraceable way. Don&#039;t even think about linking your bank account to an exchanger.

				I&#039;ve been wanting to apply for DWOLLA INSTANST, (I&#039;m also sick of the long wait), but I don&#039;t know if that would be safe.&nbsp; Anyone have info on it?

				Thanks for the info John! Though to clarify, I linked dwolla with a prepaid account, not my actual RL bank account. It is certainly still worth it, just incredibly annoying to wait nearly a week just to post some funds. But I suppose it is what it is. I believe next time I will be trying Bitinstant. Has anyone had any luck with Bitinstant? It seems much more manageable.

				I used get-bitcoin till they switched banks, and then figured out they charge way more for coins in addition to there fees<br /><br />Yes, i would definitely recommend the cash deposits with bitinstant to mtgox. You generally will get the mt gox code (emailed to you) and fund your acct within an hour. The fee is about 5% but I feel it is worth it given the ease and quickness. It is WAYYY less than you will pay for MP-&gt;btc on SR and even faster than get-btc.<br /><br />I have been waiting on dwolla instant for months. That is some serious bullshit they promote and advertise that service so much but I havent even heard of anyone being able to use it. So now I am frustrated and dont use dwolla anymore... we live in an age of immediacy and its ridiculous an electronic transfer would take days.
