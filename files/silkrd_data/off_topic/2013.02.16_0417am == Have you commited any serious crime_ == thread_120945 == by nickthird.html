				SR purchases aren&#039;t the biggest crime I have done though I have not done ones that can net decades.&nbsp; I have been brought in for questioning and attempted intimidation and I just wrote down my lawyer&#039;s name and number right when they informed me I was a suspect for a crime and was released immediately (I knew what they were calling for and was prepared for this our I would not have gone in at all).&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter if you look feel or act scared.&nbsp; Just stick to the script and lawyer up and go home, or try and cut a deal and figure out you are still fucked.&nbsp; The state is the most untrustworthy entity on earth.&nbsp; Nowadays I would not even go in to the station when a pig calls me and says &quot;he just wants to talk to me&quot;.&nbsp; Nothing to gain by even going down there and giving them your lawyers info.&nbsp; Tell them to show you their badge over the phone then tell them to fuck their dead grandma and drink a beer or 12 with a big grin on your face.<br /><br />Geto Boys:<br /><br />We don&#039;t talk to police, we don&#039;t make a peace bond <br />We don&#039;t trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns<br />We rely on the streets, we do battle in the hood <br />I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

				I personally don&#039;t believe in crime.<br /><br />They are written by people who have the stuff you want but don&#039;t want you to take it from them.<br /><br />Most of us go along with them because even though we don&#039;t have as much stuff as the people that write the laws we have a little stuff and would like to keep it.<br /><br />Thus laws are meaningless to people that have nothing and so they are the ones most likely to break them.<br /><br />Guns are better in my mind.

				yeah -- the first question this thread begs is: <br />are we talking about ethical crime or legal crime?<br /><br />personally, i have done many misdemeanors,<br />and in most of those situations i was probably morally somewhat in-the-wrong<br /><br />but we&#039;re humans and the bad is just as much a part of reality as the good is for us&nbsp; 8)

				I was questioned by the Secret Service on two separate occaisions for the theft/exchange of about $75K in US Savings Bonds.&nbsp; Long story, but I lost my job at a large financial institution for &quot;Failure to Cooperate with Government Investigation&quot; -- nothing ever happened to me outside of my job loss, but it sure has fucked me in the long run trying to get jobs in the banking industry (I was licensed with the NASB, so it shows on my U5 (or U4, not sure) that I was term&#039;d for that...&nbsp; sucks...

				Yes. Only got caught for one of them though. It was stupid really, lots of risk for little to no return. But I learned quite a bit of good stuff from my fellow community service workers. Worst part is that I have not been able to secure any kind of job since then, and not being able to smoke up out of fear of my probation officer calling me in for a drug test. But that should all be over soon! Looking forward to getting stoned out of my mind.

				In the eyes of certain industries, I&#039;ve done worse; I regularly pirate music, movies, and software. Take that, corporate US!<br /><br />I&#039;ve also bought drugs, done drugs, and sold drugs. When I was 10 I liked to try to guess people&#039;s passwords on online video games... I stole so many neopoints you wouldn&#039;t fucking believe it. I bought booze when I was 16 and brought it to a girl&#039;s dorm at a very strict Christian university.

				Again, the difference between what is morally considered a crime and what is legally considered a crime blurs the lines of what is right and wrong, since morals are subjective and we pretty much all agree to say fuck off to nanny laws.<br /><br />Possessing over 28g of weed at any time is a felony in most of the US.<br />Splitting a drug purchase with some friends in which they give you money and you give them a portion of the drugs you just bought is a felony in most (all) of the US.<br />Possessing even a personal amount of some drugs is a felony&nbsp; in many states.<br /><br />But so many fucked up things are legal or severely under-investigated.<br /><br />Great society we live in, no?
