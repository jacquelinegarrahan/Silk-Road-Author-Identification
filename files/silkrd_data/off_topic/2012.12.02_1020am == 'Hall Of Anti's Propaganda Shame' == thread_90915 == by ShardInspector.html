				It&#039;s no secret that the machinations of the state and the rantings of the anti&#039;s as well as the inventions of the media have resulted in the use of &#039;language&#039; that is pre-loaded with negativity designed to deny the average person that ability to make up their own mind on the matter of the use of illicit substances.<br /><br />For example :<br />- &#039;Crack&#039; cocaine<br />- &#039;Crystal&#039; meth<br />- &#039;Ice&#039;<br />- &#039;Grievous Bodily Harm&#039;<br />- &#039;Meth Mouth&#039;<br />- &#039;skin sores&#039;<br />- Meth babies&#039;<br />- &#039;Crack whore&#039;<br />And a multitude of better ones that I&#039;m feeling a little too lazy right now to recollect.<br /><br />I believe that it can only be beneficial to achieving our collective goals if we each individually consciously choose to make an ongoing effort to eliminate these &#039;loaded&#039; terms from our discourse, both here on the Road as well as in our private lives by using the generic terminology I.E. &#039;Crystal Meth&quot; becomes simply &#039;Methamphetamine&#039;, &#039;Crack whore&#039; becomes simply &#039;whore&#039; etc etc<br /><br />It&#039;s one way to help to continue to influence the changing of the &#039;mindset&#039; of the sheeple to one more aligned with reality... or at the least allows them freedom to interpret things as they &#039;are&#039; without the negative preconceptions attached.<br /><br />Perhaps others could assist by contributing lists of loaded terms/words surrounding drug use that we could compile into a master list called, I dunno... say &#039;Hall Of Anti&#039;s Propaganda Shame&#039; or whatever.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m delving into too minute a detail here... regardless, I hereby commit to doing so because I no longer want to assist the anti&#039;s with their agenda through such underhanded and devious means.<br /><br />

				Some of your ideas of what propaganda words are are just stupid. Skin sores....is an entirely neutral description about a sore and its location. Crack whores whore themselves for crack. Crack baby is even a medically recognized condition, although they might call it something technical. Long term amphetamine use can lead to tooth decay. Crystal meth is crystal.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Also I suggest calling them prohibitionists instead of anti&#039;s. For some reason that term just reminds me of pedophiles and white supremacists.

				@kmfkewm, I have/had a growing respect for many of the concepts you have written about (except actual killing). Ideologically agorism and to a lesser extent anarchism makes sense to me.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that your responses here are less that sensible and contribute nothing.<br /><br />First of all you insult me by saying that my ideas are just stupid without acknowledging my having written that :<br />&quot;I&#039;m feeling a little too lazy right now to recollect&quot; better ones and without offering any constructive input like some suggested propaganda terms of your own that you believe not to to be &#039;stupid&#039;<br /><br />Secondly, the whole world does not revolve around you ! Is it sufficient to make a statement asking someone else to change their natural wording just because it reminds you personally of something negative ? did it cause you any harm ? yet you want to coerce me into actions !<br /><br />And I believe you miss the point... women may have children while habitually taking meth (a rarity), but that is no reason to choose to use the anti&#039;s loaded term of &#039;Meth Babies&#039; when referring to them as it reinforces the negative and tends to make the listener believe that because there is a &#039;term&#039; for it, it must be more common that it really is.(these things are very subtle in the way they almost subliminally condition us)<br /><br />I would have thought you would have supported the idea as one more small step towards your stated goals... but whatever, maybe I have not read enough of your posts and you really are a reactionary, self centered jerk.<br />

Crack is called crack because when you cook it up from baking soda / cocaine it makes a cracking sound when heated. Where is the propaganda in that? Skin sores can really be caused from using meth and other drugs like amphetamine and mephedrone. What do you think we should call them? Skin sores existed before drugs were even illegal. Skin sores existed before homo sapiens existed.&nbsp; It has no real association with drug use unless the sores are from drug use or from behavior engaged in during drug use. How is crystal meth a propaganda term? Meth is a crystal substance. What about crystal mephedrone, should we just call it mephedrone even if it is powdery? How does ice even have negative connotations at all?<br /><br />I support the idea of combating propaganda but not living in denial. It is denialism to think that we shouldn&#039;t use the word skin sore to refer to skin sores caused from drug use. Use of some drugs can contribute to skin sores, use of amphetamine can contribute to oral decay, use of meth by pregnant women can lead to serious health consequences for their children. Crack is a slang term from the sound of freebasing coke with baking soda, crack whores whore themselves for crack.<br /><br />If you want to combat propaganda why not go tell people the truth about drugs. The truth is that LSD doesn&#039;t cause chromosome damage. The truth is that smoking marijuana doesn&#039;t make you impotent. There is so much real propaganda out there that there are tons of things that you can discredit from the prohibitionists, there are tons of excellent points you can make for drug legalization; the truth is on our side and their entire foundation is made up of lies lies and more lies. Why don&#039;t you photoshop some images that list facts about marijuana with scientific citations linked from them, and a list of lies the government has said about marijuana with links to citations, and try to make it humorous so that it catches on and spreads around the internet as a meme ? Why not make your own counter propaganda and try to get it to go viral? That will be infinitely more effective than pretending that coke doesn&#039;t make a cracking sound when it is made into &#039;slightly freebased cocaine, formed via a mixture of baking soda water and cocaine, with the mixture heated until the water evaporates&#039; (is this what you suggest we call crack now?).&nbsp;
