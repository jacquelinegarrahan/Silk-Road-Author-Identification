				Hi,<br /><br />I have been using and experimenting with drugs from past 10 years..Every one has a story?Wat&#039;s yours?<br /><br />I started using Marijuana or in India called (Bhang or Charas), 10 years back when I was in my high school. Found it quite cool and smoked it on a daily basis...It was and is always good to use and has no side effects even if I don&#039;t smoke it for a day or a week or so. After high school, I went for my graduation for an Engineering degree and that was a turning point in my drug career...Before I had just used marijuana and nothing else...In college I was introduced to a new kind of drug, which was to be smoked on an aluminum foil and taking the smoke through a pipe...It was given a name &quot;chase the dragon&quot;...I really liked it a lot and used it for nearly 5 years, sometimes smoking continuously for 3 months and then some rest and again for another 6 months and so on...During this period I was introduced to a few more drugs such as Opium, Cocaine, Ketamine and few others...As these drugs were expensive, I stick on to the &quot;junk&quot; of dragon..<br /><br />But then after some time I was addicted to it badly, and was ended up in a rehab....After coming back from the rehab I tried psychedelics like LSD and this time have quit heroin completely and never used it till date...I found out that herbs are really amazing and even today I Trust the Herb rather than chasing the dragon.... :) :) :) :)<br /><br />I am happy about it...Here on SR I order just psychedelics and herbs.... :) :) :) :)<br /><br />Share your Story and let SR community know about it...<br /><br />Cheers,<br />psytrip<br /><br />Support my Bitcoin Project by donating:1Q8EoZdidm95ziUXTnuc3Tb9ML6UE22WZR

				high school senior became pothead.. started smoking weed because my favorite personalities are names like redman biggie smalls&nbsp; wu tang cheech n chong and half baked characters.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Started listening to older music, and studying hendrix and hippies.&nbsp; then started hearing podcast and seeing video&#039;s on the psychedelic culture, psychedelic salon mckenna and leary talks ect...&nbsp; what interested me was the notion of expanding my mind and ego death.&nbsp; Started to seek a trip experience via mushrooms then lsd, learned a lot from the visions and conclusions,&nbsp; -never wanted to give up the trip experience since.&nbsp; &nbsp;majority my large dose use is ritualistic since i try to set goals before the trip and program my mind to work out those goals during trip.&nbsp; I do love recreational drug use every so often -but it gets old.&nbsp; <br /><br />seen a few friends fukk their life up because of oxycontin then H, i personally never liked opiates, seemed to be the opposite of a mind expander -i have tried my fair share of opiates -got absolutely nothing out of it.&nbsp; Dissociatives didn&#039;t interest me much even though i did like special k.. Benzo&#039;s are sloppy.<br /><br />So my story is a seek for knowledge, -and interpersonal meditation. Not taking drugs just to get fucked up, however i don&#039;t see anything wrong with getting fucked up safely.

				Just cutting in to remind everyone that it can be dangerous to post information such as educational degrees you&#039;ve sought or anything like that. It adds up.

				It was an unseasonably warm night December 13,19XX and I was preparing for a short outing before going on vacation to visit family in XXXXXX. A friend of mine picked up some pot from his uncle, and we decided to smoke it. This started a once per week smoking session that quickly escalated to daily after school special. Not quite 6 months later, a different friend brought over some shrooms. He was afraid to try them, but not wretched. I ate that entire bag of shrooms, and tripped nuts for the first time on a Tuesday night while finishing a school assignment. I got very unique comments written on that assignment from the teacher the next day.&nbsp; Anyway, the daily pot smoking continued, and shrooms were added to my schedule twice per month. This continued for about 4 months before Lucy joined the party. LSD became my Thursday night routine. I would eat 2 tabs of acid on the school bus ride home, and trip till the wee hours. Made for interesting Friday mornings in homeroom. The shrooms were passed on to a friend who was just beginning to get interested in getting higher than pot (Disclaimer: Marijuana is NOT a gateway drug, it just happens to be more readily available to individuals who would have taken other drugs had they been around, and the previous statement should NOT be used to further the bullshit propaganda campaign of &quot;gateway&quot; drugs). As the LSD remained regular, the pot died down for me. it started causing some paranoid feelings that I won&#039;t get too specific about to a group of robots today. <br /><br />This continued on like this until I met Molly. She mecame my life. Three times per week we would dance, then two weekends per month, I would cheat on her with Lucy. Of course you cannot sustain that level of use of Molly, but I was a dumb kid then and nothing anyone said mattered. I put her down entirely after about 6 months of that rollercoaster, and returned to the land of pot and LSD. The LSD supply then dried up in my area, and was replaced by prescription opiates. I don&#039;t have any regrets in my life, but the closest thing I do have to a regret is that epic struggle between good and evil with the opiates (closest I have come to being addicted to anything save nicotine) The opiate battle raged on for the remainder of my high school years, until one fateful night, there was a mishandling of an order that went down between a fried dealer and a completely drunk wretched. Pills were mixed up, and too many were taken. Three days of my life I will never get back or even remember. <br /><br />Alcohol and LSD it was now. And that is the way it remained for years, with the acid supply waxing and waning with the changing seasons. I prefer to trip during long winter nights, but the supply is at it&#039;s best during the long hot days of summer. Then one day, My good friend Bourbon kicked the living shit out of me and almost left me for dead (car crash). That was when I realized, I only had one lady that I needed in my life and that lady was Lucy. Yes lately I have ignored her for some shrooms, and 4-aco compounds with occasional visits from Molly, but by in large, Lucy has my heart, and I know she will never leave me. <br /><br />I left out a lot about cocain, meth, heroin, and ritalin. I tried coke, meth, heroin...not my thing. Ritalin WAS snorted by the truckload though, but I never REALLY enjoyed it, but it was a cheap (free) high any time I was in a drought.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I left alot out, but you should get the basic idea of my drug use history. As for identifying information, if my parents are on this forum, they could probably recognize this story, so hi mom, hi dad!

				Started drinking on St. Patty&#039;s Day a few years ago. Tried weed shortly after that, followed by shrooms, MDMA, Percocet, and a couple others, until one day I found Silk Road. I&#039;ve tried probably another dozen or so substances since that day.<br /><br />I&#039;ve cooled it in recent months, as I&#039;m making a serious effort to save money. I&#039;ll still roll on occasion, though.<br /><br />I&#039;d go into great detail, but<br /><br />1) honestly, very few are going to read responses of others and will instead just post their own stories, and <br />2) being specific about some things can come back to bite you later if you&#039;re ever arrested and the popo find your innermost confessions here.<br /><br />Glad to hear you quit heroin, OP. I used it off and on for a year or so, but gave it up early this year. I was tired of vomiting for several hours just to get a nice buzz, and the price just wasn&#039;t worth it.

				I used to be completely opposed to the consumption of drugs, but I got interested in mysticism and stumbled upon the writings of Aldous Huxley, and eventually read his Doors of Perception. This made me more open-minded about drug use, particularly psychedelic drugs like mescaline. I researched all the popular drugs, and decided that I wanted to try LSD and MDMA. I did MDMA about five times within the space of a month, then decided to combine it with LSD for my first psychedelic trip. Subsequently I discovered Silkroad, and have since tried pretty much all the popular drugs in existence, with the exceptions of heroin and cocaine. My preferred drugs are now LSD, mushrooms, dextroamphetamine, ketamine, and cannabis. I don&#039;t drink alcohol any more, although before I discovered better drugs I drank every day.
