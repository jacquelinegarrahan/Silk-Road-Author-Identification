				Found this gem.<br /><br />4 /5 :&nbsp; Prompt shipping, great Product. I do have to Ding you on Packaging. Pills were taped in the nakedbuff and when tape was removed, product stuck to tape. In order not to waste product stuck on tape I had rool up tape and smoke it...different sort of buzz, but wont smoke powdered scotch tape again.<br /><br />WTF? I hope this person didn&#039;t do what they say they did. Just in case they did and they read this. Any residue stuck on tape is going to be 99.98% filler. I just weighed a 2mg K-pin and it weighed 171mg, what does that tell ya?

				Actually it tells me that 98.83 % of that powder stuck to the tape was filler lol <br /><br />No but for real that is a hilarious feedback. Must have been all the yummy toxic polymer byproducts. Hopefully they werent serious... <br /><br />Contemplating it though, I might suck on a piece of tape with some of my precious blue residue on it... but you know they cost like 30 bucks a pop and are around only 69.69 percent filler so it would be justifiable :P

				I simply cannot imagine his thought process that justified smoking fucking scotch tape (burning plastic and polymers? no thanks!) to get the residue of some pill that may or may not be even smokable.<br /><br />I pity that individual. :/

				We can only hope that situations like this will eliminate some of the morons from our planet.<br /><br />&quot;How did he die?&quot;<br />&quot;Well we thought it was because he smoked Scotch tape, but it turns out he did that on a daily basis.. Apparently he died when he tried to quit smoking cigarettes by injecting nicotine concentrate into his eyeballs....&quot;<br />&quot;Oh.. Ahahahahahah&quot;

				Hey in all fairness, the guy DID pay for that 1.17% that was stuck to the tape. And the economy IS in a downturn. lol. Gotta get your money&#039;s worth.

				Scotch tape isn&#039;t made of plastic, it&#039;s made of a cellulose film (polymerized glucose subunits) ... but yeah, i&#039;m gonna be quiet now.<br /><br />Don&#039;t smoke tape kids!<br /><br />PS: I&#039;m sure the adhesive is poisonous enough to clear the gene pool of just one more spec of ever increasing pond scum

				omg, i laughed my ass off at that. nice comment too PriscillaMarie, that was just as funny if not even better.<br /><br />On a side note, when I was young, early teens I guess, and my cigarettes broke I&#039;d try to find ways to get the most out of them. I scotched taped one and smoked it. All I can say is nasty. Though I didn&#039;t catch a buzz like this person did.

				Damn it man! Now you say something. Damn! I need to stay on the forums more often. I have also had this same tape problem. Product sticks to the tape. I don&#039;t get it. I tried smoking it but the fumes and taste.... YUCK! No thanks. Then I started liking and sucking on the tape. I ended up with cuts on my tongue and in my mouth. OUCH! Painful!! Again, not a good idea. AND Neosporin tastes bad and NOT intended to be in your mouth. READ the direction first. Another lesson learned. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried to scrape the tape but it always ends up in tiny strips and the glue always comes off.&nbsp; Any ideas... Please help. I paid for it and I want it.

				Now, that&#039;s just silly.<br /><br />The proper procedure is obviously to melt the tape in everclear, and then simply drink the everclear/tape/powder mixture.<br /><br />For added streed-cred, light it on fire before drinking.&nbsp; :o

				I cleaned my pipe with 91% iso alcohol to dissolve the goodies and then proceeded to boil it off on my gas stove in a Pyrex baking dish. A small flash fire later and poof, ghetto resin recovery is complete and ready to be scraped into a gooey pile with a razor blade. Oh yeah, don&#039;t throw water on an alcohol fire cause it floats like grease and stings like a bee.

				OH, Disgusting. You drink it? EWE!! The tape cuts my mouth and tongue. I do not want to experience the &quot;other end&quot; of that situation. NO THANK YOU! I do not care what you soak it in or how long. IT can NOT be good coming out that way. Drinking it... some people will do anything.
