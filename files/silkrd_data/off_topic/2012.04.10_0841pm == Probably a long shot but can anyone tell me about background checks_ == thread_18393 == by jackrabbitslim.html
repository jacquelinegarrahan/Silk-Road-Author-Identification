				they are very serious when they do background they take your finger prints and run them thru (CPIC,RCMP,INTERPOL in Canada) check for youth offenses,Adult offenses,driving,and even any complaints filed against you that were never dealt with they keep all of this in your file as a security reason for vulnerable people like if you want to be a DR.Nurse,PSW, daycare worker or alot of other jobs now

				In addition to the poster above.<br /><br />They will also run a credit report/history on you. Under the reason people with good credit can manage money and wont get themselves into situations that could be solved by selling secrets/doing illegal things.<br /><br />If your going for secret clearance they will also start digging into family history unless your going for the very entry level clearance.&nbsp; Under the same principle as above, if your family members get themselves into trouble, and you know secrets you may be inclined to &#039;sell&#039; them to help the family member out.<br /><br />Secret clearances your friends will get DOJ/Home Land Security agents that come and interview them (they&#039;ll likely call to setup an interview). These guys are highly trained to detect lies and will be carrying, but they are usually actually friendly.. DO NOT lie to them or advise your friends to lie, they are looking for lies, or reason to think your deceiptful. They usually are looking for what type of person you are, such as responsible and if you are trustworthy.<br /><br />

				A position of public trust means<br /><br />-crim record check<br />-credit history (though you can social engineer them claiming some story why you have shit credit)<br />-urine sample if you&#039;re an American<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking into something like being a cop/postal inspector or anything requiring secrecy clearance they interview your friends, bullshit lie detector test (even though lie detectors are 100% pseudoscience) and all of the above.

I went through several federal background checks in the past 6 months for financial licenses I hold in different states and for a concealed handgun license and they were both pretty thorough. The first thing they will do is run credit as it&#039;s the simplest and most cost efficient way to weed applicants out being that a standard tri-merge report only runs about 19-22 dollars. Typically the only thing you can get away with on credit reports are medical collections, but any late payments, alias names or derogatory trade lines will indeed need to be explained. Residency history for typically the past 10 years will also need to be furnished and depending how important of a public position you are looking to hold extended family members will be interviewed. Like Raven said, be 100% truthful or it could come back and bite you in the ass. I know with what I do I have to maintain a certain amount of surety bonding for each individual state and any sort of misinformation can invalidate that thus rending my licenses useless. <br /><br />Best of luck on whatever it is you are seeking.&nbsp;

You can forget about getting the job if you have a crazy record. The government takes backround checks very serious and its a simple process. Maybe you could get lucky and someone would make a mistake but thats about all you can hope for.

				Thanks everyone for all of the insight. From what I understand this will be for the lowest level type of clearance so hopefully it will not be too intense. <br /><br />My criminal record is clean as far as I know. I do have some late payments recently due to relocating and not having a job but I would imagine that should be understandable. I am a little worried about how thorough the urine screen will be but am planning to be clean for 5 days and hope that will be enough. <br /><br />Thanks again please let me know if there is anything else that might help&nbsp; :)
