				Funny how the idiots always manage to find my threads, it&#039;s aggravating there isn&#039;t more intelligence to respond to. Why is it that the trolls respond more than any other type of poster? If you have something to contribute then contribute, but if you&#039;re just stirring up dirt, which you obviously are StExo, piss off because we&#039;re beginning to get a little sick and tired of your 007 stories here on the forums and muckraking.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I agree with Raz, why was this thread deleted? It used to be the case that the moderator who was responsible for locking a thread used to give a reason as to why the decision was made, as Jack N Hoff&#039;s moderator thread was deleted without reason there seems to be no reason to the reasoning.

				One more time. I have a right to fucking make a fucking post without a fucking Libertas locking my fucking posts the second I post it. So I am reposting it.<br /><br />***Raz smiles at the posts on the thread, entertainment has never been this cheap in his town***<br /><br />Lol. Silk Road forums doesn’t need more mods, it needs a re-assessment done by one person --&nbsp; you know, the Pirate -- on the current effectiveness of the present ones, and new categories for members. This has been coming for a long time. Silk Road can’t continue like this indefinitely. No one who loves to name drop should ever become a mod. I have seen so much bullshitting here recently with certain members swapping wives’ tales I’m surprised we don’t have to go out and actually recruit from MIT or somewhere more mainstream to find someone who knows A) how to work productively, and B) how to keep their mouth shut. Someone wanting to be a mod for the glory of Rome should be the last person to be selected for the position -- lol, did I actually just say that word? -- even if their heart is in the right place. This forum already has seen way too many gossipers and shit-talkers given the mantle of moderator untested. We have seen how people with that set of skills handle it. If someone is drawing a [edit.] from DPR then they should pull their finger out and actually do the work instead of strutting around and preening over the fact that they have blue squares next to their name.<br /><br />Along with PrincessHIGH, I believe new categories would go some of the way to fixing this. I believe that the SR Geek membership should be utilised, not just the SR Vendor membership, though the name should change to something like ‘Tech Support’ or something, and SR forums augment the already widely adapted SMF Friends category for people who consistently deliver top notch, senior drug support and/or SR forums support and can fulfil the role of Guidebots. This would take strain off the moderators and in turn reduce hours required to ‘moderate’. The spin-off from this is that new moderators could be screened, tested, acclimatised to the job, and eventually have the opportunity to become mods themselves. In order to do this however, DPR would have to go back to selecting mods, which IMAHO is how it should be done. Nothing garners support for a newly appointed moderator than the fact that they have been made mod by him personally as opposed to the recommendation of the previous mod, which is the way mods have been selected for a whole year now. <br /><br />Thanks to Princess for her input, she is one of few who actually knows what she is talking about and doesn’t bullshit, also, thanks to Jack N Hoff for opening the debate. I don’t agree with everything the OP’s said, only 99%, but still that’s actually pretty good. I would like to agree with others who said that he is mod material, and disagree with others who said he wasn’t, he’s one of very few who has discipline in speech here on the forums, and doesn’t name-drop, and is here night and day answering not just questions confined to one sections, but EVERY section -- rather unnerving --&nbsp; and is pretty much modding here anyway, but with no pay. Only problem is the multiple vending acc./ s and the impinging time required to do both. It’s impossible, it is not fiscally worth it.<br /><br />This thread is one of the biggest can of worms opened all week. Nice one Jack. Hope it doesn’t get locked like every other thread around here. Still waiting to hear from other posters. I go by the “one good one is worth 20 bad ones” thing.<br /><br />Piece, Love, Fuck Haters.<br /><br />***Raz turns back to his chow mein***

The difference between &#039;Global Moderators&#039; and &#039;Local Moderators&#039; is the &#039;Local Moderators&#039; are usually assigned to a specific discussion board rather than all of them, however they have the same function and permissions as the &#039;Global Moderators&#039; for their particular board. Jack N Hoff would make a great &#039;Global Moderator&#039; in my opinion as he has expansive general knowledge amongst all of the main boards, however there are some shining stars (without naming names, they know who they are) who would sparkle as &#039;Local Moderators&#039; within &#039;SilkRoad Discussion&#039;, &#039;Security&#039;, &#039;Drug safety&#039;, &#039;Philosophy, Economics and Law&#039;, and &#039;Newbie discussion&#039; boards. &#039;Local Moderators&#039; would also be a great support to the &#039;Global Moderators&#039; as they&#039;ll be specialised within their discussion board and will strengthen our commodity, please bring on the green squares! :)

I believe that the SR Geek membership should be utilised, not just the SR Vendor membership, though the name should change to something like ‘Tech Support’ or something, and SR forums augment the already widely adapted SMF Friends category for people who consistently deliver top notch, senior drug support and/or SR forums support and can fulfil the role of Guidebots. This would take strain off the moderators and in turn reduce hours required to ‘moderate’. The spin-off from this is that new moderators could be screened, tested, acclimatised to the job, and eventually have the opportunity to become mods themselves. In order to do this however, DPR would have to go back to selecting mods, which IMAHO is how it should be done. Nothing garners support for a newly appointed moderator than the fact that they have been made mod by him personally as opposed to the recommendation of the previous mod, which is the way mods have been selected for a whole year now. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>In my honest opinion we only need one or two new &#039;Global Moderators&#039; (blue squares) DPR needs to assign a team of specialised &#039;Local Moderators&#039; (green squares) the only one I remember was &#039;DoctaFeelgood&#039; when the &#039;Philosophy, Economics and Law&#039; board came to be.

Jack N Hoff would make a great &#039;Global Moderator&#039; in my opinion as he has expansive general knowledge amongst all of the main boards, however there are some shining stars (without naming names, they know who they are) who would sparkle as &#039;Local Moderators&#039; within &#039;SilkRoad Discussion&#039;, &#039;Security&#039;, &#039;Drug safety&#039;, &#039;Philosophy, Economics and Law&#039;, and &#039;Newbie discussion&#039; boards. &#039;Local Moderators&#039; would also be a great support to the &#039;Global Moderators&#039; as they&#039;ll be specialised within their discussion board and will strengthen our commodity, please bring on the green squares! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like a good idea to me :)<br /><br />I actually thought princessHIGH was a moderator when i was new. i nominate prinny for green squares.

				I&#039;m guessing it was because many people got all psyched up about who is going to become the new moderator when there wasn&#039;t going to be any new moderator for the time being the thread got deleted. So that people could calm down their expectations.<br /><br />I do however think it was an easy solution and a bad way of going through with it since this is suppose to be a libertarian forum which it is for the most parts. So to go about and censor a thread in such an obvious way seems to have been a rash decision. <br /><br />The post DPR had in this thread should rather have come in the deleted thread and maybe a lock on the thread.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174074.msg1251101#msg1251101">Quote from: CrazyBart on June 18, 2013, 10:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I nominate myself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />lol&nbsp; ;D

Your capability of speech is a property itself and you can do with it (in the same way) as you please. The two&nbsp; have to take in consideration each other not causing one harm to the other on their personal right of doing with them what they want.<br /><br />As a single example: your house is your property and you can do with it what you want, but there is also the house of the neighbor and what s/he wants to do with it. BOTH have to be taken in consideration. You cannot do what you want with your own property if what you want harms the liberty of another individual to do the same.<br /><br />Consider Liber Oz of Crowley, for example:<br /><br />1. Man has the right to live by his own law—<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to live in the way that he wills to do:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to work as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to play as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to rest as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to die when and how he will.<br /><br />2.

If however your act doesn&#039;t harm anybody else&#039;s rights it is a totally arbitrary act (and harming another&#039;s individual freedom) to remove the right of doing with your property (i.e. your voice in this case) what you want with it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t exchange the freedom of doing with your own property what you want with the freedom of doing what you want to the detriment of another just because you have that right.

				I think it is not an easy task to find somebody DPR can trust for a mod position. And now taking a rush because the community screams for it can lead into problems.<br />Im sure he already have an eye out for somebody, im not worry about that.<br /><br />What i am worry about tho is somebody incompetent taking over.<br /><br />This place amazed me when i first joined. The nice tone in the forum without much moderation impressed me. I am around black markets for about 10 years and never have i encountered a nice speech anywhere! even in forums where there are more mods than users... <br /><br />What i always hated was the fact that moderators close topics, delete them and etc without any reason behind it. They always got me mad. Not so in SR! almost no moderation and if there was something moderated the moderator explained his action pretty well. <br />Where is the sense to not give a reason to it? The guy who made something wrong posting whatever, never knows what he did wrong and can not correct this failure in the future. Not only that but the most important thing to avoid here are the bad vibez coming from such actions. This is like a bad vibe seed which should be destroyed asap or sr will become just like any other forum out there...<br /><br />Now all of the sudden a new mod pops up (libertas or something). Seemingly a good one. Very much distanced from the community.<br /><br />All of the sudden has administrator status :O well whatever, probably someone DPR knows better than he knows scout or whoever.<br /><br />But now this guy starting to act like all the other mods i met in the former blackmarkets and gets the same negative vibez around here, for me at least. That pretty much sucks balls. I really hope this one guy doesnt destroy all the positive vibez coming from here. Because deleting a thread without a given reason is the first step in the wrong direction.<br /><br />u can see it in businesses all around the world. A new boss comes in and destroys all the good things the former boss has managed to accomplish.<br /><br />Look at PKR. The first very good 3d poker room, so much potential, pretty much DEAD. Why? because the CEO sucks utter balls. I bet this guy has never had cards in his hands.... They dont listen to their community. Infact the community says make 1500 chips double ups and they go and make it 10.000 instead...<br /><br />If they hire ME as their ceo the community would grow by 1000% in one year - guaranteed! Damn it, i think even 1 month!<br /><br />But no, it seems like someone from the family or something took over and now thinks he is a marketing genius... ffs. I hate such revolution brakes. <br /><br />Look at icq. Wonderful program. Now every update is a downdate. Try and search the function &#039;log out from this account&#039; in the new icq client... go and SEARCH! u will have a hard time finding it.... why? without ANY sense AT ALL. It was where it was for 10 years... and now some super stupid faq thinks it should be somewhere else.... WHY???? Why make good and running things bad and confusing.... :/<br /><br />I know in a supermarket they change the places where a specific product lays usually. That is because they want their customers to search harder and maybe find something else they could need on their way. I understand the sense behind it.<br /><br />But What sense does it make for icq to change the function they had for over 10 years and just put it somewhere else where nobody would ever guess its there????? Why would this guy from PKR go ahead and do something completely against that what his community wants? I just cant see any sense behind that.... maybe its just me!?<br /><br /><br />Anyway i really hope this doesnt go on like that because then SR will lose its magic to me :(<br /><br />I really hope who ever deleted that topic will give a good reason for that publicly. Just to save the good vibez in here....

What about spreading lies to ruin their reputation? What about publishing racist ideas that alter people&#039;s behavior to whole groups of people? What about trolls who destroy a thriving online community?<br /><br />Of course, the only acceptable definitions of harm are the ones you personally believe, and if others think other things are harmful they are wrong.<br />
