				I guess I have this stereotypical view of heroin users as junkie burnouts just barely getting by, but that can&#039;t be true for all users. Does anyone here regularly use heroin and live normal, peaceful life?

				Check out Heroinlife.com<br /><br />It&#039;s a whole site of people, some quite successful, who have lived the junky lifestyle.&nbsp; Very current too.<br /><br />The owner, Neil, used to be an independent writer (even for places like Gawker, of all things) and now he runs his own site.<br /><br />He&#039;s a shameless self-promoter, but he has some interesting stuff here too.<br /><br />As for here: I can think of 3 people on here that I am sure are having real lives every day plus shooting up several times a week.&nbsp; They write coherently on the forums too.&nbsp; Since only about 100 people post on the forum regularly, that&#039;s actually a pretty fair percentage, huh?&nbsp; :)

				No experience with H but decent amount with oxycodone.&nbsp; If it&#039;s all the same I&#039;d say it&#039;s extremely rare.&nbsp; Keep in mind any junkies probably would have pawned their computer once they got strung so if the guy is online it&#039;s at least some sort of indication he hasnt hit rock bottom yet, ofc he could be living on the streets accessing it through the library so take it with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Opiates are an strange thing and it&#039;s true when they say most opiate sellers are users.&nbsp; Most anything sellers short of crack are USUALLY users to some degree of their product but Opiates have the ability to really bring you down fast so it&#039;s more pronounced in them , couple that with the fact that it&#039;s like air once you are hooked and the fact that they have more supply than normal and it&#039;s easy to get strung.<br /><br />That actually reminds of a story that is very true.&nbsp; I asked a friend who brought junkies to the doctor.&nbsp; When he told me the whole plan I was surprised and asked him if he was afraid the next month the junky will just goto the doc and get the script for themself and never need to buy from him again. At the time I was naive about how much a tolerance could grow.&nbsp; He laughed and said it doesn&#039;t matter if all the junkies in the world had their own script, they are all junkies and it&#039;ll be gone in two days, probably with him sponsoriing them on the in, and selling their pills to them a few days later when they blew through their cut of the pills.<br /><br />So, with that I commend ANY functioning user.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s a serious monster to hold at bay.
