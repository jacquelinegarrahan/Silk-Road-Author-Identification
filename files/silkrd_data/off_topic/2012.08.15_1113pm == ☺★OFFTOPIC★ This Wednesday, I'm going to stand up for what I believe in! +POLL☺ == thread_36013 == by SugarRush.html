				Today, I&#039;m going to be talking about the world&#039;s oldest profession, prostitution, which in no embellished term, is what I do. <br /><br />“Whore&quot;, &quot;Prostitute&quot;, and &quot;The Oldest Profession&quot; are other words people use to describe escorts.<br /><br />Prostitution is the act or practice of providing sexual services to another person in return for payment. <br /><br />The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a “Prostitute” and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including a “Client”. <br /><br />Prostitution is one of the branches of the sex industry. <br /><br />It seems so funny that still today prostitution is still so shunned and hidden away from today&#039;s modern society, what about the “oldest profession” is still seen as taboo I wonder? <br /><br />Is it that us, “whores” are selling our souls to the devil? <br />Or simply having sex for payment? <br /><br />Sex is a very broad statement, but it only really scratches the surface. <br /><br />One would say that the act of penetration should be defied as sex, where as others would say that oral sex, foreplay and even kissing is still an act of sex...<br /><br />Done and dusted, right? <br /><br />What about porn? <br />Or even page 3? <br />Is that not selling sex? <br /><br />Surly, looking at photos that you have purchased of a person and imagining having sex with them is still paying for sex? <br /><br />We could even go a little deeper and say that all people (I use the statement people, as this cant be simply used as a rule for women) that use sex or the appearance of the act of sex as a practical or empathetical bather in relationships. <br /><br />Think of every time you had make up sex with a partner, were you truly sorry or appearing to be sorry?<br />Or marriages are in some way prostituting themselves?<br />Think of every time you have flirted with a person for your own personal gain? <br />Flirted with the boss? <br />The waitress? <br />Think about overtime you gave a person sex for love?<br />Think of popstars we see on tv parading themselves around in bras and panties? <br />Think of every billboard we ever walk past, does it have an ugly person on the front or a 6foot beauty? <br />Think of the cars we buy, the food, the clothes, the music we all purchase? <br /><br />Surly, it is all designed to be attractive to our major senses and sensations arousing something within ourselves.<br /><br />So the question ultimately boils down to...<br /><br />ARE WE ALL WHORES?<br /><br />There is one simple solution to all of the above, and that is ultimately to SUSPEND HARSH JUDGEMENT. <br /><br />RESPECT a persons right of freedom of choice. <br /><br />As in my opinion as long as we are hard working individuals. <br /><br />We should be FREE to do as we like as long as we are treating ourselves with the RESPECT we NEED and DESERVE. <br /><br />Endof :)

				Also she can&#039;t spell surely (she spelled it surly) which even though your points ring true (even if bluntly put) is clearly the most important factor in play Shiz. If you can&#039;t spell &quot;surely&quot;, surely you can&#039;t have a valid point.

				I don&#039;t know too much about it, but the sex industry is &quot;legal&quot; (Grey Market) in many Asian countries. There is a difference between &quot;Street walkers&quot; and &quot;pros&quot;<br /><br />the &quot;pros&quot; are organized, vetted by the local gov and (supposedly) tested regularly.<br /><br /><br />My ONLY point is it is not viewed as such a &quot;dirty&quot; profession all over the world.<br /><br /><br />bucket mouth ?

				&nbsp; lim, I completely understand the frustration here, pretty much no one here likes this poster and if you were just a poster that would be fine, but you&#039;re a mod and should act in a semi-professional manner.&nbsp; You&#039;re doing an increasingly shitty job here as mod, you had absolutely no right to delete her account, this post was in an off topic section and wasn&#039;t any more or less useful than most in this section.&nbsp; Just because you didn&#039;t like her doesn&#039;t give you the right to delete her account.&nbsp; Allowing your friends to post personal information about her on these forums was incredibly unprofessional and no matter how pitiful tt&#039;s actions are you shouldn&#039;t allow that type of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp; Also, at first you would just berate people when you suspected something fishy but now you delete or lock any threads that you suspect were started by shills or any threads started by beggars even though that isn&#039;t your job here.&nbsp; The things you are encouraging from your chat shit friends are the things that you&#039;re supposed to be moderating, and the things that you&#039;re doing as a mod are just you drunk off of your own power, there is no rule against beggar threads, and unless you have proof that someone is a shill you shouldn&#039;t lock their thread, well at least that&#039;s my definition of innocent until proven guilty.<br /><br />&nbsp; I honestly think you should rethink how you act as a mod here, that&#039;s all I&#039;m trying to say.

				&nbsp; I already know all of that, this is my point, forum rules are forum rules, and I think it&#039;s pretty serious when a mod breaks them or allows them to be broken, the circumstances don&#039;t justify breaking them in this case.&nbsp; I remember a previous case where a vendor was threatening to post a buyers address on the forums everyone was screaming for the vendor to be banned, and suddenly a mod is banning the person being victimized in this similar case rather than the other way around?&nbsp; If you and SR were two newb posters and you were doing what you were doing without being friends with limetless and without SR&#039;s previous posting history then you would be the one being banned rather than vice versa.<br /><br />&nbsp; All of you engaging in petty blackmail against someone who was clearly an emotional wreck of a person should be ashamed of yourselves, your points don&#039;t stand up as actual defense against the low actions you&#039;ve committed anymore than someone can stand up in a court of law and tell the judge that the victim was dressed in slutty clothes and therefore the rape was warranted.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; What I&#039;m saying is that even if she did make it easy or even understandable for you to victimize her that still doesn&#039;t make it right or acceptable to do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Your reasoning is no more correct than iforgotpassword&#039;s when he claimed that his recent scamming of people was a favor to the community because it was a lesson for people not to finalize early.

				No offense &quot;dumbass&quot; but if you had had the amount of silly messages etc that I have had (which other members have seen) you wouldn&#039;t be crying a river like Justin Timberlake, she literally messaged me 5-6 times a day at one point with things that were quite seriously disturbing. You say that I &quot;let my friends&quot; DOx her but actually she did that herself and at one point I was actually the one trying to help her out of the situation by telling her she needed to delete her account and start again and yet she just carried on and got abusive but then she just flipped out even more and then decided to get more abusive. So yeah that&#039;s where I draw the line, she broke HERSELF and I&#039;m sorry but I only have a certain tolerance of fools. Then after this she started to harass me and not just in a minor way either. I showed the shit she was sending me to a couple of Vendors I talk to on a regular basis and they both agreed it was neither normal nor ok for her to be sending me stuff like this. The fact she persisted after this and did silly threads that just revealed who she was further was the reason I banned her account. Or what would you rather me do? Allow her to carry on clearly identifying herself willy-nilly so she just becomes a target for knock on the door by the police? So all in all, get your facts straight.<br /><br />The fact I took the piss out of her a bit afterwards is fair enough in my opinion, you&#039;d be fucking frustrated after dealing with this shit over and over again.<br /><br />Also, &quot;dumbass&quot;, grow a spine and use your real account to say what you think. Chuck-aways don&#039;t earn you any respect from me.
