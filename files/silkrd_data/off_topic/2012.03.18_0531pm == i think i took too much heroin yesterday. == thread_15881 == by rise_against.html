				the first night i took it, i used a larger water to powder ratio, the liquid i shot was basically clear and i was feeling great.&nbsp; like a good buzz off a couple roxies or something. i&#039;m not very good with needles tho, so i think i missed the vein on half of the injection, and i had this swollen bump at the inject site for a few hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but yesterday, i used a larger powder to water ratio, and the injected fluid was dark brown. About 5 minutes later i could barely talk or walk straight.&nbsp; Could not keep my eyes open. saw vivid colors whenever i closed my eyes.&nbsp;

				yea, i&#039;m thinking heroin, isn&#039;t really my drug.&nbsp; i&#039;d hoped it might be, since its one of the stronger opiates. so i&#039;ll be moving on to something else.&nbsp; any suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp;i want a drug that will make me happy and energetic, yet still able to function normally.&nbsp; maybe there&#039;s no such thing. i have some 2c-b, MXE, some Ketamine and some MDMA, so one of those is next.&nbsp; &nbsp;

YOU (I judge the drug) ... but am free to my own opinion right? :) ).

				I don&#039;t care what they say about Kratom not having a tolerance or anything, but I tried it after being over a year clean off heroin and the next day I felt mild w/d&#039;s so it will definitely still make you have W/D&#039;s if you get them from other opiates.<br /><br />I was excited, because it says that shouldn&#039;t be the case, but I may as well done some H, because I didn&#039;t feel too good the next day.<br /><br />No matter how long I am sober if I do opiates I withdrawl the next day mildly.

				If you get a swollen bump on your arm then yes you have missed the shot. If you get pour some hot water over it so that it will faster subside.<br /><br />If you want a drug that makes you energetic and happy then why the fuck would you do Heroin,a Depressant of all things?<br /><br />I suggest you try mdma,6apb,coke or mephedrone thesese will all make you energetic and chatty :)

				Heroin always knocks me out for good 12+ hrs when I decide to go to sleep it was really bad when I first started cause I&#039;d be always getting outta bed late and having to hammer the accelerator and just rip it to work going like 20km/h over posted speed...

				I forgot to mention.&nbsp; A good dose of clonazepam (or any benzo, but specifically clon) will keep you happy, talkative and active for like 8 hours without being completely fucked up (i&#039;m assuming your talking about a drug that will let you go about your daily business, eg. work, without being blitzed out of your head?).<br /><br />As far as I know clon is the most effective for longer acting, whereas alprazolam is a more potent high shorter lived.&nbsp; *shrug*&nbsp; dunno what exactly you&#039;re looking to achieve ... but hopefully something better then incorrectly banging (missing the vein) too much H and passing out for half a day :(

				Dude if you want to be energetic and euphoric your messing with the wrong stuff ahaha. Try mdma,crack,meth any of those will jumpstart your day. Even some of the 2c&#039;s will have you up and feeling great.
