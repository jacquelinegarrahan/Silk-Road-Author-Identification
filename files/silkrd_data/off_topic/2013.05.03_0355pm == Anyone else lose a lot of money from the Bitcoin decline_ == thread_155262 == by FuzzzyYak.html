				Since around midnight on May 1 to now, BTC has been on a steady sharp decline. Originally at ~$145, they are now hovering just above $90<br /><br />I had about 5 BTC, which means Ive lost just over $250 :(<br /><br />Any other similar stories?<br />How do speculate BTC price 1-2 weeks from now? What about 6 months from now?

				Yes, my timing must really suck because every time I buy a bunch it seems to go down before I can make my purchases. It&#039;s all part of the game and SR is my gambling addiction I suppose. Looking on the bright side, it keeps me away from the casinos. <br />

				I wouldn&#039;t even attempt to speculate on the bitcoin market at this stage. It is a very volatile market at the best of times, so who knows what will happen?!! I have lost a lot of money this week alone with the value of it fluctuating. I&#039;m going to hold onto the coins I have, in the hope that the value will rise sometime soon :)

				BTC is so volatile. There is now way of telling the direction it&#039;s going to go. I had about 20 coins and have lost about $1000 in the last 24 hours. That&#039;s just the nature of bit coin.<br /><br />Some people are saying the price declined due to the fact that SR was down, because once the site was open again, everyone started cashing out their coin.&nbsp; Also, one factor that people don&#039;t understand, once they see a decline in price, everyone starts panic selling making the situation worse.<br /><br />I believe BTC price will hover around 120-150 in 1-2 weeks. It may be more, but I don&#039;t see it staying below $100.

I have actually really learned how to chill out and relax over this past year, so I guess it is not all bad :)

				I deposited 500 USD when it was 110 a coin and by the time I got home, it was down to 95 a coin. Unfortunate but it&#039;s the nature of the game.

				I lost about 100 bucks, sucks but I&#039;m fortunate to not be one of the people who lost thousands. I typically buy only what I plan to spend within the next 24 hours + a few extra to be safe.

				I&#039;ve gained money during this period because of trading :) If you know when to sell and when to buy you don&#039;t lose anything during periods like that, you just make money instead.. But well, trading takes a lot of time and it&#039;s not for everybody. In the meantime, the amount of bitcoins I have is rising thanks to the crash so if it appreciates significantly again it&#039;d be pretty cool..<br />But I do agree that it&#039;s not as good as the days before the crash when all you had to do was to buy anything and money would magically appear. Or buy stuff and be richer the next day.

				This week I had 5k in BTC, and that&#039;s what I had after the drop from 150 to ~110<br /><br />Spent them at 110, (I also spent at 140 but fuckers canceled my order because they hedged in BTC not USD)<br /><br />So I lost ~40 per 100 I have, so this week I lost 2000 to the BTC fluctuation.<br /><br />Still haven&#039;t been hit too hard, but it is some real BS<br /><br /><br />Any other vendors having a shitty week?

				I absolutely HATE Bitcoin.&nbsp; I buy large and it takes a few days to buy bitcoins for these larger purchases. I am charged a percentage to get the bitcoins in the first place.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that every time I am buying bitcoins, the declines in value makes it impossible for me to purchase what I&#039;m trying to purchase.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor, I don&#039;t hold bitcoins for investment purposes and I&#039;ve lost over $2K in the past month.&nbsp; SR needs to find a better system for secure buying and selling....this isn&#039;t working.&nbsp; To top it off, the fact that SR is down while Bitcoin value declines makes you a victim...nothing can be done but watch while your $$ vanishes.&nbsp;
