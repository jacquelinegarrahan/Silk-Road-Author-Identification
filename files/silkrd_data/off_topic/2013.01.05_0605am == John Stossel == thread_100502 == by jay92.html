				Just watched it.&nbsp; Stossel&#039;s guest says that SR takes power away from government and gives it back to the people.&nbsp; Stossel then concludes that &quot;of course Silk Road is a good thing.&quot;&nbsp; Love that guy.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up on that.

Somewhere on the forums I saw it named as such and that the reasoning had something to do with the fact that stopping the people who can safely drive drunk is an annoyance/something to that effect, when the only problem are the people who crash?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I&#039;m remembering that wrong, though. It sounds far to biased against legalizing drunk driving, and I&#039;m certain I was reading it from a libertarian stand-point.

The number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities dropped from 21,000 to 10,800 between 1981 and 2009, and we have more people driving more miles today. I have no problem with an &quot;annoyance&quot; that saves 10,000 lives a year.<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/special/fatalities.html
