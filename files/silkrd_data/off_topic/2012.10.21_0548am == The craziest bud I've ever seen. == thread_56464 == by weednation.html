There are no green leaves on it its literally purple. ALL PURPLE!!!<br />I&#039;ll pay 30$ a G for that shit right now if someone has it on SR :P <br /><br />LINK: <br />PIC 1: http://www.trichomevillage.com/images/004/001.JPG<br />PIC 2: http://www.trichomevillage.com/images/004/002.JPG<br />Blog page where I found the pics: http://www.trichomevillage.com/very-purple-marijuana-strain/<br /><br />Feel free to share whatever weed pictures that you&#039;ve got below because I want to see them!&nbsp;

				I have actually gotten completely purple bud off SR. those pics you list are so dark it almost looks black though. this bud was denser, with a beautiful fade from dark (violet) purple to a lighter (amethyst) color. had bright orange hairs and frosted with trichomes which stood out against the deep, rich background. also had the most delicious flavor like citrus purp candy. it was called vader and was more potent than most purps, definitely some of my favorite bud i have ever gotten. <br /><br />i got it from LexiSadie. even mentioned it to her recently about getting more cause it was some months ago but she just said she really missed it too. keeping her eye open for another worthy purp she said. also got some grape ape from her which was pretty similar but a stronger grape flavor and had about 10% green. <br /><br />some more weed porn if youre interested, but a few of these have a tiny bit of green more like the grape ape<br />www.theweedblog.com/darth-vader-marijuana-strain-pictures/<br />http://reviews.nuggetry.com/buds/purple-vader-greenwell-cooperative-bass-space<br />http://budgenius.com/Darth-Vader-Purple-HIP-Collective-BG0010001E77C.html<br />http://i.imgur.com/3UP4l.jpg

				You guys want some nug porn... Check out a guy on youtube named Subcool420... His harvest pics are up on the rolliitup forums and vids are being released a couple times a week. Amazing buds from a breeder.
