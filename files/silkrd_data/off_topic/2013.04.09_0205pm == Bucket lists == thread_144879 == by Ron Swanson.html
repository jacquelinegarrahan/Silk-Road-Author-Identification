				so let&#039;s say you only have a few months to live, you&#039;ve already got your head round it so no need to waste time doing that. the money you have will barely cover basic survival and the only transport you have is a bicycle. what do you do and where do you go in europe? this is NOT a list of drugs to do so please don&#039;t do that here. i don&#039;t need backpacking on low budget tips either. it&#039;s about life. alone. what are we supposed to fit in there when friends and family don&#039;t factor in? could maybe get some extra cash busking, people are not so generous to the untalented but still, humour me. what would you do? if it&#039;s the netherlands and denmark i don&#039;t need persuading :) adrenaline junkies and travel addicts speak up! and people who live in awesome european countries that are generally safe for solo female travelers i want to hear from you! obviously NO hitching... if you know any sick unmissable mountain biking trails, festivals that are easy to get work at, nice coastline routes or anything like that which could reveal your general location you can pm me in confidence. keep it positive. cool. cool cool cool.

				These days, i think the best way is to put up an indigogo or one of the other fundraising sites and social media it until there&#039;s some decent cash.&nbsp; Honestly, I don&#039;t think that just turning up and hoping for a job will work these days, simply because even tourists aren&#039;t spending. The picking season is upon us but that&#039;s seriously hard work but you can usually get work.<br /><br />If she fancies cambodia, the town on the island of koh rong is always looking for people to work in their bars, same as with most places on the tourist trail around that part of the world. I suppose it might be the same in spain and greece but I wouldn&#039;t bank on it too much.

				nah not looking for steady work, that&#039;s why i said busking... just want to live a little life before it&#039;s over. the reason i said europe is because flying is completely out of the question and way too expensive.

				well how about becoming a juggler?&nbsp; Get that right and you&#039;ll be more than guaranteed to make money as everyone loves jugglers (particularly when you get their kids involved, it should open their purse strings) or even becoming an incredibly bad magician that&#039;s a comedy act.&nbsp; just playing music will get you some money but you&#039;re not actually engaging with people, which can be half the fun ;)

				I always see europe more as a museum than an adventure playground but if you&#039;re feeling brave, how about just going with the flow and cycling from wherever you are to Pamukkale (clearnet) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale&nbsp; Just take it as it comes and it will be an adventure!

				Bucket Lists are tools for lazy people to get up and do something. <br /><br />I live everyday like it will be my last. I look both ways at an intersection when driving through a green light. Yesterday, a full sized pickup truck ran a red light, in the middle of the light sequence and in between a pack of a dozen cars. It was travelling in excess of 45 mph into cross-traffic, of which I was a member, that was traveling 40 mph. I&#039;ll let you do the math on that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a &quot;bucket list&quot;. Instead, I think about &quot;legacy&quot;. What will I leave behind? What have I accomplished in my life. I live this way, on edge, ready for the cops to take me out of society. (I&#039;m a nonviolent offender, and always will be; I don&#039;t carry a gun, unless I&#039;m going hunting or to the shooting range). I race to get everything done, so I have time to make sure what I do is right. I double check my work--most of the time. If it is important, I triple check it. Sometimes I don&#039;t leave the house because it&#039;s not clean enough. I don&#039;t make plans with friends or family, because work and perfection comes first. I don&#039;t use lazy type-speak on forums, because I believe that following rules doesn&#039;t end when we&nbsp; become &quot;anonymous&quot;. Everything I do has purpose, and if it doesn&#039;t, then I make it purposeful.<br /><br />No, my friends, I don&#039;t have a bucket list. I may die tomorrow. Our society may go extinct form climate change, meteors, volcanoes, earthquakes, gamma ray bursts, viruses, superbugs, or some such event that we have yet to discover, experience, or understand.<br /><br />With that said, I have been to all 7 continents. I speak more than one language. Ich verstehe und liebe Deutschland! Und Oestreich! Und Frankreich! Yo estudio y amo todos cosas. Genki desu ka? Se va? I have a love for all men and women, because we share a common ancestry, and if we stick together, we can share a common future. I am not a full-blown libertarian, because I still have too much love for unfortunate people. That is why I am concerned about my legacy, and not a trivial bucket list. It&#039;s about what I leave behind, not what I selfishly experience myself. Helping others is the greatest thing anyone can ever do in their life. I know, because much of my life was spent in my mind, by myself. I didn&#039;t start talking until I was five....<br /><br />So let&#039;s ditch the bucket list, and think about how short life is, how fragile it is, and how quickly it ends if we don&#039;t leave things behind for the next generation... Or the next 7 generations.

				It&#039;s fucking hard living with that. I&#039;ve tried suicide many times. I&#039;m a fucking coward... I know how smart I am, and what&#039;s worse is that I haven&#039;t figured out how to make everyone see this shit... So I write. Here. There. Every fucking where. It doesn&#039;t pour out fast enough. I wake up at odd hours and sometimes go days without sleeping (without the help of Road stimulants). I&#039;m no genius, but I also don&#039;t forget many things.<br /><br />I live day to day the life I&#039;ve lived. Sometimes my mind plays memories from my childhood. Good ones. Bad ones. When the Prozac stops working, I smoke a bowl... When that stops working, I run five miles. Even then, I don&#039;t stop thinking. I never stop thinking. Even when I&#039;m seemingly catatonic and inexorably suicidal, I never stop thinking....<br /><br />So help me save the fucking world. That&#039;s the greatest thing any human can do. The Ultimate Hero. LE: are you reading this tonight? This morning? Tomorrow? Fucking read it. Think about it. You can&#039;t catch what doesn&#039;t exist. You won&#039;t stop evil when it never existed in the first place. The only evil in this world is blindness. Don&#039;t choose to be blind.

				take it easy mate. you must think even more than i do and there&#039;s a lot of pointless crap running through my head too. good luck with saving the world and leaving your legacy. that sounds like effort so i will fade away quietly and people will forget all about me before i&#039;m even gone :)

				I lurk a fair bit on the forums, on and off, so your nick&#039;s familiar, Ron.<br /><br />I&#039;ve probably missed something here, apologies, but I hope you&#039;re not dying...&nbsp; or thinking of suicide&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Anyway.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard Germany has a lot of interesting places to bike to, if you have the stamina for biking.&nbsp; A lot of castles and medieval ruins if you&#039;re into some solo exploration.&nbsp; Some are fenced off, but if I were working through a bucket list with months to live those would be the places I&#039;d especially go to, just for the thrill.

				@abby: I love you!<br /><br />Thanks... Sorry to shit on the Bucket List... I was sober... I&#039;m good and stoned now...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I recommend visiting every continent. It&#039;s something I couldn&#039;t live without... because I&#039;m always thinking about when I&#039;m going to do my round-the-world sailing trip.<br /><br />That&#039;s my bucket list... Before I die, I wanna sail around the world. Not necessarily solo... just as long as its by wind and at sea... Fuck I miss the ocean.
