				i can&#039;t believe i found these last night! they&#039;ve been there for almost 3 years. i thought they were gotten rid of when i went to rehab. and i can&#039;t believe the cops didn&#039;t find them when they raided my house and brought dogs. what would you do with them? i sold one for $60 an he said they seemed a little week and burned like hell. the burn is so bad.

				They do degrade...&nbsp; sell them 1/2 discounted and make sure to mention the burn to the buyer beforehand.&nbsp; They will still buy.&nbsp;

				i think i will do just that. $60 is too much i&#039;ll sell them for $40. there just so hard to get rid of because oxy goes for over $1 a milligram around here now so everyone just buys heroin. and if you snort these the burn is so torturous. the coating seems like it&#039;s melted to the pill and hard to remove. and the powder is no longer white when crushed up. it&#039;s like an off white kind of light yellow.

				i usually have pretty bad karma, even though i don&#039;t think i ever really do anything wrong, so it&#039;s a nice change! i bought some pure alprazolam powder and did 15mg. then i think i lost it and ended up tarring up my house and found it along with the OCs. lol.

				i figured out what i&#039;m going to do with these. there pretty useless as they are so i&#039;m going to extract the oxycodone. i should end up with around 7 grams of pure powder that won&#039;t burn like hell. i wish water didn&#039;t take so long to evaporate. this should be kind of neat though when i&#039;m done.
