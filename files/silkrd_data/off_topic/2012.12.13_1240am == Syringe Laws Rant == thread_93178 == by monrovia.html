				I&#039;m fucking pissed. I guess I&#039;m spoiled too. I used to be able to walk into a pharmacy and get syringes if I so desired and barely ever even had to show ID. I&#039;ve since had to(sort of) relocate to a new, much more archaic state in the US. I got some product today and really wanted to put it in a pin, but apparently I need an insulin prescription to get syringes. It really pisses me off, because by me not being allowed to get a syringe, one of three things is going to happen....<br /><br />1.) The person I&#039;m caring for will have to wait longer for their insulin and be inconvenienced by having to physically go to the pharmacy.<br />2.) I&#039;m bullshitting the pharmacy tech about the caregiver thing, and I really do want to shoot up drugs. However, they wont sell me syringes so I&#039;m going to use one of my dirty ones and risk Hep C or share a needle and risk AIDS/Hep C.<br />3.) I&#039;m bullshitting the pharmacy tech about the caregiver thing, and I really do want to shoot up drugs. However, I&#039;m just going to snort my drugs for now and shoot up next time when I will have ordered syringes through the mail.<br /><br />In other words, these hick ass laws accomplish nothing other than increase the chances of me getting a disease, or inconvenience/possibly bring danger upon someone who I could potentially have a real responsibility to take care of. Like, what if someone was having an emergency, really needed an insulin shot, but had no pins and asked me to go to the pharmacy for them?&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m all pissy faced that I didn&#039;t get as fucked up as I could have gotten, and my new home is getting on my nerves.&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty well established fact that when you make clean needles available to the IV drug user population, it lowers the AIDS/Hep C/etc. rate among them. Canada, The Netherlands, certain US states, and many other countries(I&#039;m sure) have figured this very simple equation out. <br /><br />EDIT: Meant to post in drug safety. Oops.

				Wow that is horribly screwed up, I had no idea. It&#039;s really pathetic that we are regulating pointy objects. Exactly how pointy does something have to be for there to be laws about it? <br /><br />When a law is proposed, don&#039;t they need to argue some kind of reason as to why it should be a law? I can&#039;t even imagine what ridiculous justification these bastards could possibly have for depriving people of clean syringes. I really hate this country.

A few years ago, I used to think that there was a federal law mandating pharmacies to sell to anyone. My area seems to be filled with self righteous, judgmental types that want everyone&#039;s moral compass to be aligned the same way theirs is, and the politicians pass laws that intend to impose this morality rather than promote safety/health/freedom of their constituents. <br /><br />And I&#039;m not much of a fan of our country either. I really want to live in Portugal(anywhere in the EU would be cool though.) I went there twice to visit family. There aren&#039;t cops on every fucking corner trying to bust you for speeding or drugs(obviously, as they are decrim.) They really aren&#039;t around at all unless you call them, although I was on a small island and not an urban areo on the mainland.
