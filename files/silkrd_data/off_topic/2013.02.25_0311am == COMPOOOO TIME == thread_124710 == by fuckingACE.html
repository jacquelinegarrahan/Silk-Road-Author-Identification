				Already posted this in another comedy/lotto&nbsp; thread, It is a story that is nasty/funny but definitely worth a read! Lmao It kills me every time I tell it!<br /><br />this didnt happen to me it happend to my friend but its literally one of the nastiest things iv ever heard so im gona tell it!<br /><br />so my friend met this girl at a party, me and a few of the girls knew her from around the area and she has a bit of a rep for being a dirt, which we told him, to which he replied &quot; great a night of dirty sex it is for me so&quot;<br /><br />he went home with her that night and they did the bizzness, the next day when i saw him i noticed he had a weird black spot above his lip, where he had had a cold sore that was beginning to clear up, i asked him why it was black and he said he didnt know, he thought it was just the cold sore scabbing over, we thought no more about it<br /><br />i seen him again a day or 2 later and the black spot had now tripled in size it was about the size of a thumb nail at this stage and raised a fair bit off his face and discusting looking, i asked him what the fuck was going on with his face and he said he didnt know but the spot was really itchy, i booked him an appointment with the doctor because i really didnt like the look of it &amp; thought it bit strange that it only flared up after he had been with that grimey girl, i went with him to the doctors with him<br /><br />the doctor had no idea what it was or why it was black and refered him to the hospital to have it lanced, i also went with him to this appintment wich was 2 days later, the spot had gotten even bigger at this stage and he said it felt like it was moving in the inside <br /><br />so he went in to have it lanced and when they did it a mass of tiny insects came out of it all over his face!!!<br /><br />the dirty bitch had crabs and they had gotten into the cold sore somehow and had been muntiplying under there thats why it felt like it was moving on the inside because it literally was!<br /><br />so guys the motto of the story is if you have a cold sore beware of dirty bitches with crabs because you might get an infestation of them on your face!<br /><br />Lmao mine is meant to be a joke because it is funny as fuck especially to me, but it&#039;s more of a story! Hope quality counts!

				A Puerto Rican, a Pakistani and a white guy are at the top of the Empire State building admiring the view. The white guy says, &quot;Watch this&quot; and proceeds to jump off, yet flies around and returns to the platform, and says, &quot;See? It&#039;s easy! There&#039;s updraft winds that carry you! Hearing this the Pakistani says &quot;I want to try&quot;. And takes the leap, yet falls to his death, <br /><br />A few moment&#039;s later the Puerto Rican guy turns to the white guy and says. &quot;Superman, you son of a bitch!&quot;<br />
