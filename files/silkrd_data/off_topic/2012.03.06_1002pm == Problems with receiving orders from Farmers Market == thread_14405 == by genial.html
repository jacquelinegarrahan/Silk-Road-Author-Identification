				the percentage of received packages from the USA from NL is grossly over-estimated. I don&#039;t believe a vendor that claims 90% or higher from NL.&nbsp; Search for other threads where plenty users are sharing how many packages from NL are seized.

				BB, I thought you were stating in your first post that you were shipping out of NL, but your second post reads like you are recieving things shipped from NL. I know that people do have luck with packs from there (I haven&#039;t had any intercepted), but I wouldn&#039;t claim that because I got my pack that there is no way others are having problems.

				well I had 2 packs arrive to NL no problem just late as usual scared the shit out of me for 2 days but arrived and same as the USA 9 days shipping to there. Canada ships mail there everyday which I thought was wierd and strange.Maybe to many large envelopes in the bag that day from Canada<br /><br />Sure hope Belgium,Germany&amp; UK are easier
