				IF you are being legit, you could sell them on the SR for moneypaks. You would have to make a name for yourself. Or you can make a MT Gox account and sell them, depending on if you would want that much heat from your coins

				There are PLENTY of clear net solutions assuming you want cash and want to remain anon. If being anon does not matter to you, then there are even MORE possibilities open to you.<br /><br /><br />Goto bitcoin.org check out the wiki and look at all the ways. After then check out the cointalk forums. Even more ways. Really not that hard people.<br />

Seriously, this is blatant bullshit. How would you get coins that cheap? And who in their right mind would sell coins at a 20-50% discount? If you can get that many coins, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d be smart enough to sell them at, or near, market value.
