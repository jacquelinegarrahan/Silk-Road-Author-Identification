				Thank you for support in my time of need.<br />Just because I point out a vendor&#039;s serious short comings does make me LE.<br />Just because I reward good vendors with good reviews doesn&#039;t make me a shill LE.<br />Just a shill ;)<br /><br />I really do try to be fair with vendors, and some know I have complained to them privately, or even helped them out.<br />I have made a few mistakes, but try to out weight that by doing good for our community.<br />It&#039;s hard to be positive all the time, but I try. (Free benzos would make me try harder;))<br /><br />Have faith, this will pass, and another one will replace him/her.

				FACT: This all started with Limetless when he started attacking me over claiming that there were cops on here posing as buyers and tanking vendors&#039; feedback, and that we had reason to suspect that those with good ratings might be cops. No one has ever offered any reason why some particular vendors seem to dodge LE feedback trolls, instead an ad hominem attack was launched on yours truely<br /><br />In addition, buyer troll Uniwiz would automatically take the word of the LE trolls and claim I&#039;m shipping wrong, even though I ship BETTER than the top vendors by their own slip up, when you all admitted you crush weed.<br /><br />The last poster that Uniwiz references made up some bullshit about the packaging smelling, and when I challenged him on it, he backed out and said &quot;maybe it was the natural smell of the envelope&quot;. So he wasn&#039;t even sure what he was smelling and he made a comment about packaging. That didn&#039;t stop Uniwiz from using that as a reason to declare me a shitty packager. The mother fucker doesn&#039;t even know how I pack shit supposedly, unless he&#039;s one of the cops who HAS ordered from me under a different name. <br /><br />The only other buyers who have complained about me have been clearly outed as LE: williamgates and Diss0lve<br /><br />What this means is that anyone with common sense can see that you&#039;ve gone too far in your attacks, and that can really only mean one thing - that you don&#039;t like what I&#039;m saying about cops being vendors on here, and there&#039;s only one reason you wouldn&#039;t like that.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22992.msg0;topicseen#new<br /><br />Interesting thread.<br /><br />And actually if you check the thread Dank, I just said that it was silly to think that LE was stupid. And yano, baring in mind they convict people and all that and that it&#039;s use against them, I don&#039;t feel that that is a particularly offensive viewpoint to take. In fact it keeps you one step ahead of being arrested. <br /><br />Anyway have a gander through that thread I posted everyone, seems like Dank has pissed off someone else but this time has the balls to do it in private. <br /><br />You still haven&#039;t let us all know if you forced your parents to kill themselves or not by the way Dank, I am just going to take that brush-off as either a yes or they got so sick of you they tried to kill you, failed and you either killed them or they are in prison. <br /><br />Also....why the FUCK are you shilling your product here. Go get some sales...we all know you haven&#039;t had any lately. <br /><br />I really am done here. Cheers for the vote of confidence from everyone else, good vibes.

No one has ever offered any reason why some particular vendors seem to dodge LE feedback trolls, instead an ad hominem attack was launched on yours truely<br /><br />In addition, buyer troll Uniwiz would automatically take the word of the LE trolls and claim I&#039;m shipping wrong, even though I ship BETTER than the top vendors by their own slip up, when you all admitted you crush weed.<br /><br />The last poster that Uniwiz references made up some bullshit about the packaging smelling, and when I challenged him on it, he backed out and said &quot;maybe it was the natural smell of the envelope&quot;. So he wasn&#039;t even sure what he was smelling and he made a comment about packaging. That didn&#039;t stop Uniwiz from using that as a reason to declare me a shitty packager. The mother fucker doesn&#039;t even know how I pack shit supposedly, unless he&#039;s one of the cops who HAS ordered from me under a different name. <br /><br />The only other buyers who have complained about me have been clearly outed as LE: williamgates and Diss0lve<br /><br />What this means is that anyone with common sense can see that you&#039;ve gone too far in your attacks, and that can really only mean one thing - that you don&#039;t like what I&#039;m saying about cops being vendors on here, and there&#039;s only one reason you wouldn&#039;t like that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If I bought from you under another account, I still would be bitching, and moaning like the rest of the buyers whose reviews magically disappeared.<br />Your intimidation means nothing to me. Although threating to expose addresses was a bit much ::)<br />The things people forget, :o<br />and I wouldn&#039;t want people to forget it. :P<br /><br />Calling everybody LE just makes want to put my tin foil hat on, and enjoy a good joint.<br />Now figure out which LE SR account was it? LMFAO

For what it&#039;s worth I&#039;ve always enjoyed reading your posts sir as they are usually always entertaining, knowledgeable, well thought out, concise and are usually bullshit fucking free which I can respect. Considering the shitty attitude that was floating around here for the past 2 weeks with the whole Tony thing it was nice to see you as somewhat of a voice or reason in the whole thing. <br /><br />IMO Limitless has earned way to becoming a MOD and brings alot of value and credibility to the board. <br /><br />Peace.
