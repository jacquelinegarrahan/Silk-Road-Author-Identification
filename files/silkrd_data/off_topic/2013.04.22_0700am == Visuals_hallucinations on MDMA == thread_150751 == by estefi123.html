				I got them for the first time last night and were they weird man, they are nothing like 2c-b / nbome /lsd visuals.<br />I saw people appearing and hiding behind columns but when i got closer there was nothing there, only some dark spot that somehow morphed into a person.<br />People with reflexions on their sunglasses looking for microseconds as devils or a DJ with green lights morphing into a reptilian for a short period of time.<br />In the bathroom when I got close to the wall I started seeing spiders and wasps, this reminded me the comments from ex drug addicts that appear on TV, the insects thing.<br />But strangely overall I wasn&#039;t scared nor anxious, i was feeling very lovely full of energy and good mood also very horny.<br />The worst thing that happened was losing my friend and seeing another guy with a cellphone just like his (which is not a very common model) I started to think he stole it so I tried to get closer, made a call and somehow hallucinated a sound of him hanging the call it also looked as he pressed cancel call, but my friend actually picked up the call, good thing I looked at my cellphone screen before doing something stupid.<br />My vision was &quot;delayed&quot; I saw the things before my brain could process them.<br />That night I took 2 caps of bk-MDMA 70mg each and 2 caps of 120mg of MDMA each, both crystals.<br />Do you guys experienced something like this even with other drugs?

				Mmm well, I was really sleepy until taking the mdma (i took the bkmdma first and it was just making me anxious, one of the reasons i ended up taking so much in a night) <br />I dont think I had any tolerance, it&#039;s been like 3 months since the last time taking MDMA and like 3 weeks since taking bk-mdma.

				I certainly have hallucinations on MDMA at even smaller doses. I think I may be genetically predisposed to a lower hallucination threshold, because both my brother and I hallucinate at lower LSD doses than many of our friends. With MDMA, I get a kind of rainbowish halo around light-emitting things, as well as the paranoid figures you describe. Since beginning to take drugs, I actually experience acid flashbacks and hallucinations of dark areas as bugs/people fairly frequently, which makes me think this was always a feature of my brain that drugs have allowed me to attend to explicitly. Who knows.

				At those dosages I would side more with the MDMA really being MDA <br /><br />Really you only get OEV on MDMA at much high doses but everyone is different

				well if you did a shit ton of bk, then some mdma later and you were tired to begin with, you probably did have a little bit of amphetamine psychosis, or &quot;sleep deprivation&quot;<br /><br />mda doesnt produce &quot;shadow people&quot; and shit like that, it is an ACTUAL psychedelic.<br /><br />your brain is probably a little unhappy about you doing a bunch of bk then some real&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;ve had very similar hallucinations (people that weren&#039;t there) on high doses of MDMA. It&#039;s happened quite a few times, but usually only after I&#039;ve &quot;overdone&quot; it..... 400mg upwards. <br /><br />It&#039;s fairly common I think.

You most certainly can experience visual disturbances with mdma and mda but not seeing insects crawling all over. Thats sleep deprivation, psychosis or delirium.

				Anyone have experience with audio hallucinations on MDMA? <br /><br />First time I rolled I was like 19, still living at home, and I heard my twin brother and parents arguing very loudly while I was in my room, it was probably around 3 in the morning. After hearing ten minutes of arguing it became quite again,&nbsp; I called my brother to find out what happened only to find out he was sleeping and I had woke him up. Next morning I realized something, I had heard that argument before. It was an argument that happened after my brother had his license suspended, and for some reason my brain made me hear it again. I had completely forgotten about that memory until I sat down and thought about what I heard that night/early morning. It kinda freaked me out.

				It&#039;s happened to me one time on mdma, it was a pretty high dosage. I saw and was having a conversation with somebody who wasn&#039;t there and snapped back to reality after a minute. We all had a good laugh about it once they realized I didn&#039;t lose my mind.

When trying to sleep on the tail end of a hard MDMA rolling session late at night, my CEV&#039;s were, to say the least, really intense. Not even close to shallow-sleep dream-state, but seeing some really funky visuals. No OEV&#039;s, but yeah... The high concentration in the setting of tiredness and/or actual sleep deprivation can definitely incite some hallucinations.<br /><br />Fuck dude, anyone can actually vouch for this: When you&#039;re awake for 36-48 hours straight, with no drugs or alcohol of any kind, maybe some coffee, you can agree that there are definite peripheral hallucinations or hardcore aural hallucinations like bumps or whip-cracks.<br /><br />MDMA + sleep dep or tiredness can most definitely induce OEVs/CEVs.<br /><br />Psychosis? I don&#039;t know, have no experience in this. hurr durr&nbsp;

Some people just don&#039;t have the mental strength to ride out circular thought patterns and CEV&#039;s/Journeys. You shouldn&#039;t be doing drugs if you can&#039;t handle the lack of lucidity it carries.

				Not uncommon. MDMA has slight psychedelic qualities on it&#039;s own, and as stated on above, some of the MDMA gets metabolised to MDA by the liver when taken orally.
