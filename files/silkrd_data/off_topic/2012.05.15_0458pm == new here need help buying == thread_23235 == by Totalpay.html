				Dose anyone in the US have experience with any NON USA venders and if so who&#039;s the best for shipping there product to you? You can say any vender or drugs you like I&#039;m mainly looking at lsd and weed but i do more then that and im sure some other people would like to know as well, just looking for some info that i could not find. If you have anything to add i would really appreciate it :)<br /><br />Edit : Dose anyone know about the seller mahakala? He has really cheap lsd all most to cheap o.O

				Just my two cents - I&#039;ve been very happy with the weed I&#039;ve bought on SR from CA - good stuff, and no problems at all with domestic mail... personally, I&#039;m reluctant to try overseas sellers because of customs...

				This changes weekly, hell, daily.&nbsp; You just need to learn, like we all do, to check the forums that are of interest to you...if I want to know which overseas &#039;heroin&#039; dealer is doing o.k., this week, I just check the H forums, and also, I&#039;ll do a &#039;search&#039; with their name put in, just to see if there are individual threads...and what is true last week, is usually not true today...<br /><br />I suggest all newbies read the Tony76 thread, as it is instructional on short a shelf-life &#039;good&#039; dealers have...they go bad, they take off, they start shipping late, and, the curse of heroin vendors in the US: they often do their own product ha fucking ha....<br /><br />LSD vendors this is not a bother.&nbsp; So u see, u just have to learn to research, and I do it daily, and right before you purchase, no lie.
