				Hi!<br /><br />If you have seen news from erowid, it&#039;s pretty bad. They are running really low on money and ask for donations. With all that spare change we have here on SR in our BTC wallets, we can really help them! I know it :-) I decided to organise non profit lotteries. If I don&#039;t change my mind after receiving initial feedback in this thread, in a few days I will buy vendor account and start.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Erowid Center is entering a critical period of seeking major new <br />funders to make up a $60,000 budget shortfall, at a time when our <br />site requires considerable infrastructure upgrades in order to <br />continue providing top quality information about psychoactive drugs. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That&#039;s what I got in the newsletter 2 months ago.<br />As you see, even with the money they gathered in the past months they still need MUCH more cash. <br />I think this is really important, because erowid is the only place on the internet when you can find so much RELIABLE data on drugs, including dosing etc. Useful information. <br /><br />###HOW###<br />First I am going to start with small prizes, 10, 20 btc, to prove that I am trustworthy. I am thinking about selling 80 tickets for 0,125 each.<br />Out of all the money 50% goes to winner and 50% goes ot erowid. That&#039;s right, I get nothing. Non profit. Crazy, huh? :) I won&#039;t take any commission, however once have been proven to be legit, I will take 1 BTC until I get back all the money I paid for account upgrade (about 30 BTC).<br /><br />Out of i.e. 20 total&nbsp; :<br />10 goes to the winner<br />10 goes to erowid<br /><br />To choose the winner I will use online list randomizer http://listrandomizer.com/<br /><br />Donations are public, easy to confirm.<br />http://blockexplorer.com/address/1PkHvfna7fHNi1BnbYjFe5tRDLQZqLYLyz<br /><br />###IDEAS###<br />I am thinking about possible rewards from erowid directly, like signed by Hofmann blotters or other cool stuff. In addition to this I would also love to help get some money for the Shulgins.<br /><br />Shulgins blotter art fundraising (Sasha, who worked his all life to bring as molecules of you is really sick :( ) - http://www.theshulgins.com/<br /><br />Erowid bitcoin adress - 1PkHvfna7fHNi1BnbYjFe5tRDLQZqLYLyz<br />(adress proof - http://www.erowid.org/donations/donations_bitcoin.php)<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________<br />#########################################################<br />Don&#039; know what erowid is?<br /><br />about:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Our Mission<br />Erowid is a member-supported organization providing access to reliable, non-judgmental information about psychoactive plants, chemicals, and related issues. We work with academic, medical, and experiential experts to develop and publish new resources, as well as to improve and increase access to already existing resources. We also strive to ensure that these resources are maintained and preserved as a historical record for the future.<br />Our Vision<br />We imagine a world where people treat psychoactives with respect and awareness; where people work together to collect and share knowledge in ways that strengthen their understanding of themselves and provide insight into the complex choices faced by individuals and societies alike. We believe that truth, accuracy, and integrity in publishing information about psychoactives will lead to healthier and more balanced choices, behaviors, and policies around all psychoactive medications, entheogens, herbs, and recreational drugs. Erowid&#039;s vision is to facilitate and create resources that are part of the evolution towards this goal.<br />Our Crew<br />Erowid is made possible by four primary staff members, two part-time staff, and dozens of valuable volunteers who help process incoming data, seek out new resources, and/or help to update the site. For crew bios, see our Erowid Crew page.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Erowid is the best. Whatever drug-related information you may need, they have it. <br />########################################<br /><br /><br />Do you think that I will find these 80 people? Is it possible? Or maybe I should sell less tickets but make them more expensive?<br /><br />edit: Why lotto, not just simple donation?<br />Lotto has one significant advantage&nbsp; - due to its nature (prizes, money) it would be constant. It would&nbsp; generate much much more money than ordinary donation asking emails :-) Plus, I don&#039;t think anyone here would donate by his own enough money to buy with it hofmann signed blotter sheets - but it could be done with lottery. <br /><br />It&#039;s up to you. If nobody likes the idea, there wouldn&#039;t be a point in making it real after all.

				I love erowid. I&#039;ve been looking at that site ever since I was a young lad and I&#039;d hate to see it go down. I learned a lot from it.<br /><br />You&#039;ve posted their bitcoin wallet which we can all donate to directly. How about we just do that instead of trusting you (a newb) with our hard earned bitcoins. I know once I get some that I will.

				I would rather donate to wikipedia, what has Erowid even added in the past ten years? I like Erowid don&#039;t get me wrong, but I see very little difference between the Erowid of today and the Erowid of several years ago. They don&#039;t even have entries for 90% of the newer research chemicals that Wikipedia has fairly extensive information about. Google has lots of pictures. Bluelight has loads of trip reports. What unique function does Erowid serve anymore other than desperately asking for donations every other month. Seriously they don&#039;t even have a page on any of the jwh series, and a large amount of the information they do have is half assed, why does 2c-t-7 list death as a potential effect but not MDMA or any of the other drugs people have overdosed on? It even has contradictory information in some places!
