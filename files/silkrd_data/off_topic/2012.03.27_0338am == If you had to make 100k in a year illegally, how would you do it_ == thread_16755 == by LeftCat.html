				I know that in some cases crime does pay, so I guess I was just wondering.<br /><br />100k a year is roughly 9k a month, and I really don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a reasonable goal.

There was a heist here in my area that netted 10m+ You&#039;ll need some military training though and you can&#039;t do that shit alone (sadly i&#039;m a pacifist :))<br /><br />Maybe pimping some girls? Arms dealer to African warlords?<br /><br />Personally i&#039;ve always had the fantasy to be a sort of organization consultant for mobsters, the only way in this economy i can use my college degree to some practical use.

				Pay the US congress for passing legislation aimed at increasing corporate profitability and taking away individual rights... wait a minute... that&#039;s called lobbying and it is legal!&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />Hmm... Gather 150 people to create a chain of investors for pumping and dumping stocks!! 150 x $10k initial investment per person = $1.5mm in influence. Could be quite substantial if aligned with some well placed marketing and stock news!! Well... I guess that isn&#039;t exactly illegal either...&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I got it!!

				I&#039;d look for geoarbitrage opportunities, this is obviously completely dependent on where you are located. MDMA is one of the few reasonably priced substances on this site, moving large quantities of it could easily produce profits in excess of $100,000 per annum. Actually locating/creating your bulk buyers is obviously easier said than done, and it&#039;s also hardly risk free. All it takes is for one of your buyers to be caught, flip, and rat you out, although this risk can be reduced by using dead drops for transactions. If you&#039;re young, you may already have a possible network of potential bulk buyers attending colleges/universities across the country...

And looking at that, i believe even topseller only get a handful of orders a day unless they operate under different vendor names.<br />So. say, they make 50% on each order (not even counting bad ships) than you&#039;re only looking at the same amount what an average job would make you. For fun, let&#039;s double that, than still no 9k p/m.<br /><br />Another one, if you&#039;re a smooth talker and look good in a suit. Setup a ponzi scheme. Being jewish and going to Florida helps i guess.

				I would train kittens to be thieves, or rather cat burglars, and I would sell the adorable kittens to a bunch of unsuspecting families, and then later that night they would return to me with all the jewelery and cash and stuff, and if they ever got caught they are incapable of narcing me out because they cant speak.

				If I were in the U.S., and brave and spoke a bit of Spanish, I&#039;d head down to Culican MX, spend a few weeks, meet some people, and explain how there&#039;s this pretty cool, fairly safe way to move tar online.&nbsp; And how you&#039;d be willing to be the computer side of the equation for, say, 50% if they&#039;d want to hook you up regularly.&nbsp; Best sent from U.S., tho...<br /><br />That way you&#039;d probably get higher up on the food chain than I suspect most are, and since this is all new, but getting bigger, you could get in on the ground floor and make bu-coup money.&nbsp; Would take a bit of nerve and doing, but looks good to me...or better yet, keep going south on down to Cali CO, and get some powder.&nbsp; Do it right, u&#039;d own the H market, and one here, at this point, sellers are safer than buyers, unlike real life.<br /><br />Most street sales are locked up by relatives and homeboys and fellow gang members...but this is new.
