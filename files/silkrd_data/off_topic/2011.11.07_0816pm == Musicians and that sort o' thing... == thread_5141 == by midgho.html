				SO, who plays what? I&#039;m just getting to the gritty on piano so I can learn some James Booker, but I&#039;ve already conquered and recorded with violin, guitar, trumpet, tenor sax, standup bass, cello, viola, and spoons.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to learn more about theory so I can play more with other musicians, but as I live in the middle of nowhere, I mostly have to play by myself. (Nope, totally didn&#039;t go for the cheap joke. ;-)<br /><br />What do you play, who do you listen to, why, kick some pieces around people should learn! I have tons of sheet music if anyone wants it, but I never use it.<br /><br />the ghost

				I&#039;ve been playing guitar for 30 years and have been recording all guitar based Ambient/Dark Ambient/Drone since 1996.&nbsp; No synths or keyboards.&nbsp; Released 5 albums.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much I should share on this forum though?

				Keep it impersonal?<br /><br />Ever heard of Stevie Coyle? After hearing his rendition of Last Steam Engine Train, I decided I pick up guitar just for fingerpicking, then I ran across Rodrigo y Gabriela, and I think I haven&#039;t touched a pick in two years...<br /><br />g

				When I was a kid I used to play piano for like a decade. My parents successfully beat the love of music out of me to the point that I now have an aversion to it. I want to relearn how to play the piano but every time I sit down I remember all the shit that I went through the first time around and quit at that.
