				So I need a girl to help me conquer my social/approach anxiety, and sadly I&#039;ve become so desperate that I&#039;m willing to use a prostitute for this. Anyone had any experiences? Or some better advice?

				Your saying risky like, cops trying to set you up risky? And I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m willing to say what city I&#039;m near, but I&#039;m near one that&#039;s pretty big, but not MAJOR big...

				A friend of mine said he picked up a couple hookers from backpage. Had good experiences. Just find one you want, call and feel it out. If something feels off, hang up. If it feels ok, go for it.

				Ive used backpage quite a bit, and like anything else in life, you get what you pay for lol. Its pretty easy to tell the ones that are legit, they are very careful, technical if you will. Ive used their services about 4 times or so, and it always seemed to go off with out a hitch.

				I&#039;ve often thought of using Backpage because I also have social anxiety issues so I find this thread very interesting. I only reasons I haven&#039;t tried this yet is one, the girls in my area are not very attractive and two, I&#039;ve never used a prostitute in my life and I&#039;m worried I&#039;m too shy to even go through with this.<br /><br />As for it being a cop I read on there or somewhere else that to flush out the cops you just ask the gal to flash her pussy at you before you do anything. An undercover cop wouldn&#039;t show you her pussy but a prostitute would. Is this true?<br />

				I played around in the escort world for a few years, here&#039;s my advice:<br /><br />- Don&#039;t go cheap - find the one with the best ads, higher prices. They are that way generally for a reason.<br />- Talk to them on the phone first...if they aren&#039;t willing to take 5 minutes for you, move on. You&#039;ll get a good feel. Tell them you are inexperienced, they will take care of you.<br />- Don&#039;t worry about being busted...if you are worried, watch ads for a few weeks. LE ads will be up and gone in no time, real ads will stay up each week.<br />- Maybe start with erotic massage. It&#039;s relaxing and less intense than a full sex experience...training wheels.<br />- Treat these women like human beings - you&#039;ll be amazed that often times they will treat you like a human being back :)

				I have in the past used backpage quite often. I always used a website called:<br />http://escortphonesearch.com/<br />Which would tell me if that escort had any reviews and I&#039;d only go out with ones that had great reviews.<br />I really recommend this because using backpage blindly I would be afraid of scams more then police. Trust me it happens all the time were the girl takes the money and runs or she takes the money and is like and this happened to me, &quot;so where will I be escorting you to.&quot;<br /><br />Also if you have any drugs backpage hookers will almost always buy or do whatever it is for free in exchange for small amounts of shitty drugs.

				The advice to start with a massage is good advice. It&#039;s a good way for your to get comfortable without the pressure of her expecting a quick sexual experience so she can get out and score her next client. You can also see if the &quot;product&quot; matches the description and cops won&#039;t waste an hour massaging you! If you get comfortable, like what you see, and she offers additional services you can say yes - if you&#039;re unhappy or uncomfortable with any of what goes down just say no, you only want the massage, thanks and be done with it and at least get a good massage. Good luck man!<br />

				Thanks a lot for the advice. I actually lost my job right after I posted about this, so it will be a little while til I can afford a hooker of any quality, but you guys gave some really good suggestions that I probably wouldn&#039;t have thought of without trying out the whole escort thing myself. Luckily I have a few hundo left in my SR account(I&#039;m hoping like hell the price of BTC&#039;s don&#039;t go tumbling back down,) so maybe I&#039;ll be able to trade some drugs for services, but I&#039;m conserving in every way possible at this point.

				Actually backpage does have some pretty decent women, you just have to surf around a little.&nbsp; I just click on the &#039;gallery&#039; link and go by how they look first, then when I find a real eye catcher, I click on the photo and the rest of the info comes up, phone number, etc.&nbsp; Never talk turkey over the phone.&nbsp; Use buzz words like &#039;session&#039; when asking on price. I just ask if they like to party, they know whats up.&nbsp; Its usually by the hour and many of the girls do party.&nbsp; I like to get a little coke, some good quality beer, get a nice 5 star hotel, and then I call.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a few that looked like models, just jaw dropping gorgeous, and pleasing in every way.&nbsp; If I&#039;m suspicious on a cop set up I just say &quot;prove to me your not a cop&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;I need to check that your not a cop&quot; and it leads to her taking her clothes off, then I say &quot;I&#039;m still not convinced yet&quot; lol.
