				Before I knew about SR I used to buy research chemicals from buzz-wholesale.com&nbsp; I received many orders from them and they were always top quality products.&nbsp; I mainly ordered synthetic cannabinoids from them.&nbsp; Shipping was usually around 7 days from the day the order was placed.&nbsp; One day out of nowhere their page was changed to say that they were updating the site and would be back soon.&nbsp; Now they don&#039;t even exist anymore.&nbsp; The last time I ordered from them was around the beginning of 2012.<br /><br />Just wondering if anyone had any clue as to why that site disappeared?&nbsp; Guess I have no need to use them anymore now that I know about the road.&nbsp; Stuff on here is a tad bit cheaper than I was getting it on there.&nbsp; But I was always curious as to what caused their disappearance.

				yeah thats what I noticed.&nbsp; Was always curious as to why a legit vendor disappeared like that.&nbsp; Wondered if they got busted for something or what.&nbsp; When they disappeared it wasn&#039;t easy for me to find another supplier for my chems.&nbsp; I was able to though.&nbsp; Now I mainly use SR for things I need.
