				This may be a stupid idea, But I am going to a festival and where it is is extremely humid. I wont have access to a heated plate and a blade to rack up nice lines.<br /><br />I was thinking I could put a G of coke into water and then into a nasal spray.. <br /><br />Would this work? has anyone done it? would it waste my coke?

				Yes, preparing a liquid solution (cocaine is soluble in water) and dosing with a spray bottle is definitely a good idea and should work without a hitch. It is up to your personal taste, but if you can&#039;t stand the taste of saline you can use bacterio-static water. Also, before putting it into the bottle, I would mix the coke and water together, and then filter it with a syringe/cotton so you can filter out the crap. <br /><br />The ratio should be 1g of coke to 2mls of saline or bacterio-static water. <br /><br />This method is actually quite beneficial, as it regulates your doses since you&#039;ll know how much each spray has. Also, it will keep your nasal passages moist to prevent nose bleeds, dryness, cracking, and pain. It&#039;s a good idea, if you don&#039;t mind doing it differently, and would work well in humidity. Hope this helps, and hope you have a great time at your festival.&nbsp; :)

Depends what you use. An excellent refillable atomiser is an empty bottle of Beconase. Beconase can be purchased over the counter in the UK, I&#039;m unsure of other countries, it&#039;s used for allergies. Empty the contents into a regular nasal squeezer, it&#039;s very useful for coke users, and can provide relief in the days after. Rinse out your bottle, it should last a really long time (had mine for two years and it&#039;s still durable as ever). The plastic tube goes all the way to the bottom, so even the smallest amount of water will suffice. ;)

Every spray will be slightly different, as the saline or bacterio-static water to coke ratio will differ slightly.

				I&#039;ve done this before. I had bought some wet coke that never really dried out. I bought one of those nasal spray things at a drug store, washed it out, filled it up with water, and added the coke. It turned out okay. I got a decent buzz from it but i probably should&#039;ve just wet lined the stuff i had.

				Yea, this is a great way to do it, and is how I do my H when I go on trips and am with the family. Very incognito.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t stress about any degradation unless you are mixing up a lot and it&#039;s going to sit for a few days. Just a gram will probably be gone in a few hours.<br /><br />Do a line to test strength, figure out how much you need for a dose, then figure out how many doses are in your amount, and figure out how much fluid each spray is measured to, I&#039;d get a small vial, spray a full squirt into it, and draw it up with a syringe, and see how many units it is. Using a 1cc oral syringe, or one with a point, add the amount it drew up in the syringe per measured dose of you coke, this way each spray is relatively close to a single dose. You could even multiply by two so it&#039;s a spray per nostril for a dose. Don&#039;t forget to shake before each doses administration.

Once you&#039;re done, the spray bottle will not be anywhere close to full, or even close to half full ...probably not even a quarter full if you&#039;re only mixing a G.<br /><br />1ml is about 1cc, or a full barrel in a 1cc syringe, so you figure a dose is .1 you get ten from a G, with 20 units times ten, which would be two barrels (2cc-&gt;about 2ml), so that&#039;s about right. You&#039;d want to figure the amount of fluid the bottle sprays per spray and then base your doses off of that because it may spray more than .1cc, or .2cc.

You&#039;d want to figure the amount of fluid the bottle sprays per spray and then base your doses off of that because it may spray more than .1cc, or .2cc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank-you for explaining how the coke/solution ratio works, and your correct it&#039;s all dependent on what kind of bottle/atomiser your using, and what strength is the dose +karma for you.<br /><br />Bottles/atomizers vary in dose between 0.01-0.5ml. If you have a high ml per dose ratio, for example 0.1ml per dose, you can opt for a higher dosing bottle to keep squiring at a satisfactory range, which would be 5-10 for a hit in my opinion, but some would say that might be too much, so start with 2 in each nostril, see how you feel and work up from there. If you create a higher concentrated solution, you will need to use a 0.01-0.10 dosing bottle. I would still highly recommend you experiment, and veer on the side of caution. If you find your coke solution too week, add tiny amounts of the saline or bacteriostatic water, until your satisfied with the result. On the other hand, if the results are too strong, and one squirt has you shitfaced, empty the bottle into a sterile container, and dilute it with saline solution or bacteriostatic water as necessary. Hope this helps&nbsp; :)
