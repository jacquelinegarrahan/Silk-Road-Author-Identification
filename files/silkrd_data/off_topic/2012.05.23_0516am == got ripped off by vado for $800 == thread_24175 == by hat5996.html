				If you have already sent the MP then no, there isn&#039;t much anyone can do.<br /><br />Did you read the forums at all before choosing a BTC vendor?&nbsp; With all the established BTC vendors on SR you went with vado who is new and has several bad reviews if I recall correctly.

				Looks like you learned a very expensive lesson:<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy without researching the vendor on the forums first.<br /><br />Vado&#039;s been called out as a scammer multiple times.<br /><br />He even had a review ON HIS VENDOR PAGE that said he was a scammer.<br /><br />How the hell did you miss that?<br /><br />Cheers

				Got ripped off by the same guy for over three hundred dollars. Sent him my code and lost all communication with him after that. I was a dumb ass and it was before I knew to check the forums and realize the signs of a scammer. Sorry you took such a blow mann
