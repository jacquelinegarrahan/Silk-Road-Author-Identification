				Hey there, <br />I hope I&#039;m in the right section to post this.<br /><br />After finding Silkroad I also found my love for psychedelics like LSD, Shrooms and 2CB (I think you can categorize this into this group)<br />Since drugs are expensive I want to make a few bucks here and there. <br /><br />That&#039;s why I&#039;ve decided to write this thread here. I hope this is not against the rules. Please don&#039;t hate me if I&#039;m doing anything wrong here ;)<br /><br />I wrote my first website when I was six. Sure it was crappy as hell, but I&#039;ve learned a lot and now I have around 15 years of developing knowledge. After writing a lot of websites with JS, PHP and CSS I continued learning by writing desktop applications with VB.NET. <br /><br />After a year I found out that VB.NET is really bullshit and started to use C#. I developed a lot of fancy stuff using C#. I programmed my G15/G19 Keyboard by writing my own library using the USB Layer, I wrote a DirectX based game-overlay which worked using VTable Hooks, wrote a lot of cracks and hacks for games and other applications (I never played online, never released something - just for research. I don&#039;t like cheaters in multi player games) . I specialized on Source Engine based games like CSS, TF2 and stuff back then.<br />I&#039;ve learned a lot in reverse engineering and then I started to use C++. I continued to write hacks for source games in C++ like VAC2 safe wallhacks and ESP&#039;s by sniffing the TCP Stack of the game. I never tried to cheat online and never did, it was just really interesting to rip a whole game apart. <br />After switching to Linux I started to read into Qt which is my favorite framework for now. Most of my applications are written in C++ or C#. In my real-life I&#039;m a trained web developer and I manage around 1000 web shops for around 4 years now. My job is great and I learn a lot day by day.<br /><br />Even though I have a lot of motivation and experience, coding is still a hobby, and I&#039;m a pretty honest guy. I don&#039;t want to make hundreds of dollars, I just want to make some B&#039;s.<br /><br />Depending on your request you would pay 2-10B&#039;s. I think that&#039;s a reasonable price. I try to give my best to finish your requests and I&#039;m open for almost everything. If it&#039;s just a simple application I even would go down to 2-1 B. It all depends on your request and I just like to help. <br /><br />If you need help in a specific topic because you are a developer by yourself you can feel free to ask me. I like to help and would do it for free if it&#039;s a simple question. But of course, I could try to teach you stuff for a few bucks too.<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to ask! <br /><br />Oh I almost forgot that. I&#039;m very untalented in design. I&#039;m really just a very boring developer. Nothing creative is in me, except in code-design. :)

				Yes, I work on around 1000 shops. I&#039;m a worker in a company. It&#039;s not my company, so I&#039;m just a simple employee. I don&#039;t get that much money for that.<br /><br />Insulting me is immature, you should calm down and grow up.
