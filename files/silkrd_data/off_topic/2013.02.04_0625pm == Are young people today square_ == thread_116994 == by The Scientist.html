				Is it just me, or are young people today very square compared with the last generation? With regard to sex, drugs, musical tastes (e.g. justin bieber), etc.... it&#039;s like we are regressing to a pre-counterculture mindset in some ways. everything is becoming more conventional, one-sided, &quot;in the box&quot;, &quot;wholesome&quot;, domestic, &quot;normal&quot;, etc...... or maybe I am deluded?

				I think it&#039;s just a perspective thing really. The kids today do far more drugs than we ever did but they are all getting them prescribed by their doctors now. In the USA and by extension most Western Countries, we&#039;ve been going through a bit of a conservative revival post 9/11 which means more folks have been finding god and all that good stuff. If you look at it in the grad scheme of things there is a two to three generation cycle between rebellion and conformity and we are a well over midway through that cycle right now (think Independence War, Temperance Movement, Civil War, Roaring 20&#039;s, the 60&#039;s as examples).<br /><br />If I were predict the future, I would say we have another few years of relative calm before the people stand up and demand something change. My guess is that the issue this time around will be the whole &quot;Big Brother&quot; government that we have allowed to be built up around us and an insistence by the younger generation that we cast of the shackles of enslavement by proclaiming ourselves the masters of our government rather than the other way around.<br /><br />So, as far as my social calendar is concerned we are right on schedule for the cyclical nature of our social boundaries.&nbsp;

				I totally agree with OP. Its crazy, you walk into a restaurant and every couple, young and old, more young though, are all glued to their iphones. Not even looking up to talk to each other. I have a little sister and thats all she fuckin does from the time she gets home to the time she goes to sleep is stay on that damned iphone and tweet and post all day.&nbsp;

				just because this topic is on a drug forum doesn&#039;t mean everything has to be focused on drugs. this topic has nothing to do with drugs, you should be able to tell that. <br /><br />but i dont think doing drugs makes you either square or circle or triangle. Think OP means this generation is stuck to technology, making us dumber than previous generations. and not just technology, but the shit on television, radio, pretty much everything mainstream that they&#039;re &quot;supposed&quot; to listen to and watch, thus conforming the younger generation how the media see fits.

				I think threads with topics like this are square.<br />You only see the surface of these&quot;young&quot; kids.<br /><br />You don&#039;t know what they are up to in their personal life.<br /><br />As for the technology diss..this almosts sounds like the bull conservative people talk about.<br />Oh things were better before,kids are anti-social.<br />They just have new means of connecting to the world.<br />It doesn&#039;t make you dumber,it&#039;s just a different approach to doing things you were doing 1475.<br /><br />We are all unique but at the same time VERY similar,no matter where you are from.Therefor we have clichés and mainstream.<br />Eventually we all conform to something,just not in the same way or tweak it a bit depending on our personalities.<br /><br />I find society and the mainstream in general,young AND old,to be very infantile whether it comes to demanding things from the goverment/society or rejecting things from the goverment/society,handling the economy or many other things instead of looking at themselves and learn how to put things in prospective.<br />Change is good,not always easy.<br />That&#039;s why we always have to tweak and work on society that is always moving forward.<br /><br />Making superficial claims that basicly EVERY generation makes about the other at some point is so repetitive and boring i&#039;m surprised this always comes up.

				I don&#039;t think the young people today are any dumber than a previous generation. Better technology just let&#039;s people see it more. Social media and smartphones leads to the ignorant ones broadcasting their opinions. In reality, every generation had their idiots.

				With today&#039;s generation I&#039;ve found that the people are split very distinctly, as in each person is either one or the other, between being fairly open-minded vs. being &#039;square&#039;. (although, you do get the occasional person somewhere in the middle who, say, smokes marijuana everyday but thinks all other drugs are evil). But yes, I&#039;d say a majority of people are &#039;square&#039;.<br /><br />In my experience I&#039;ve found that people with just a HS degree or an associates degree tend to be more open-minded, while those with a bachelors degree or currently attending a 4 year college tend to be more close-minded (especially those in more technical fields of study). I think one attributing factor for this is that those who have pursued a 4+ year degree have gone most of their lives &#039;just doing what they&#039;re supposed to do&#039;, have always played by the rules/laws, bought into often conservative propaganda, and never really thought about (or have been too afraid to think about) alternative ways of living/thinking or doing certain &#039;negative&#039; things that lesser educated people may be associated with.<br /><br />Certainly this isn&#039;t black or white and I&#039;m sure there are plenty of people who are not described by the two categories above, but this is what I have run into.
