The suspects, from Vallejo, Stockton, Oakland, Fairfield, Los Angeles, New York and Oklahoma City, were arrested Thursday, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner said.<br /><br />The investigation, led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, uncovered a network of drug distributors centered in Vallejo&#039;s Crest neighborhood, across Highway 37 from the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom theme park.<br /><br />Thizz Entertainment was started in 1996 by Andre Hicks, a<br />Vallejo rapper who went by Mac Dre. The word &quot;thizz&quot; derived from the feeling one feels while on MDMA, or ecstasy. On November 1, 2004, Mac Dre was shot and killed after a performance in Kansas City, Mo., which started a brief Vallejo-Kansas City rap war.<br /><br />More than 60 artists have released albums on the label since Mac Dre&#039;s death, some were arrested in the federal drug probe.<br /><br />Arrested on suspicion of multiple drug counts in the two federal complaints and in custody were: Major Norton, performs under the name &quot;Dubee&quot;, Lawrence &quot;Bodine&quot; Nelson, Narco McFarland<br />Sr., Eric &quot;Pay Pay&quot; Robinson, Eileen Knight, Ung Duong, Phat Nguyen, Marcus Davis, Michael Smiley, Anthony Young and Anthony Payton.<br /><br />Charged and not yet in custody were: Michael Lott, performs under the name &quot;Miami the Most,&quot; Gaylord Franklin, performs under the name &quot;Geezy,&quot; Clifford &quot;Black&quot; Bullock, Latroy Cunningham, Dante Barbarin, Beshiba &quot;Pebbles&quot; Cook, Bruce Thurmon, performs under the name &quot;Little Bruce,&quot; Damian Peterson, Mikel Brown and Andre Cawthorne.<br /><br />Charged and released from custody were Nicholas Ramirez and Tiffany Brown.<br /><br />The origins of Thizz Entertainment go back to the Vallejo-based Romper Room Gang, which prosecutors say participated in armed bank robberies, drug trafficking and murder during the 1980s and 1990s. Many members of the gang were sent to prison, including Mac Dre who spent five years in prison. When he was released from jail, he changed the name of &quot;Romp Records&quot; to Thizz Entertainment and his popularity soared.<br /><br />During the investigation, agents uncovered trafficking in ecstasy, cocaine, cocaine base, heroin, Oxycodone and marijuana. Drug shipments were sent from the Vallejo area to Oklahoma City; Jamaica; Queens, N.Y.; Atlanta; and Milwaukee, Wis.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Lets be real. There are a lot of very bad people who deal drugs. In fact in many places to become a dealer these days you need to be able to inflict violence or pay people to do so. As dealers here can see - there are MANY scammers amongst drug users who will rob you blind if given half a chance and sadly there are dealers and users who would kill over trivial amounts of debt or worse over some &#039;beef&#039;.<br /><br />Rappers play into a trap by glorifying violence in some cases. Sure many lyrics are tongue in cheek but some is not and its basically criminals bragging about what they got away with. Unwise really. Treating the cops like idiots is idiotic.<br /><br />The rapper Mac Dre sang this &quot;Man, can&#039;t even find who&#039;s been robbin&#039; you blind.&quot;<br /><br />Sadly he was shot by someone he either ripped off or badmouthed. And its the police who will bring comfort to his bereaved family. They will do their best to find the killers. And god forbid if it were your child killed you would hope the police could find them.<br /><br />Murder is a terrible crime and we should support the police when it comes down to someone having a life taken. The &#039;feds&#039; do some good work. the cops often dislike busting some dealers. <br /><br />And the cop women uniform, I&#039;d like my women to dress up like that and arrest me and go through the whole scene of reading me my rights, handcuffing me and then I escape from them and produce a [fake] gun and its truncheon time.<br /><br />Was that an overshare ;)
