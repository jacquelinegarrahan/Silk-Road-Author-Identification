				it was the typical so typical situation today. four of us. <br /><br />character one: drinks a lot. i just started training him in the ways of the weed. we like the same music. so we are blazin to it!! nice fella, a bit sketchy tho. would sellout. sadly he knows i drop. I talk too much when i drink! gets scared of harder stuff but drinks like its holy water.&nbsp; drug retard.<br /><br />character two: I trust him, he is family. he knows i drop. no problems. takes the secret to his grave! he is clean! maybe some hash.....<br /><br />character three: rich, spoiled guy. saw him before but i didn&#039;t give a fuck. he was all buying us drinks and all that gay shit. pink cocktails and fuck knows what.&nbsp; Interesting fella. You can see the cravin on him. Spoiled and never had a proper fix. I could sell to and through him. Very social.&nbsp; But he is a drug retard and would od&nbsp; or get hooked or get copped. 100 percent chance of bad ending.<br /><br />Fourth character: Me. I dropped. Nice. The girls around me picked up the vibes very well. its a shame i cant fuck on this thing. Some acted like forest nymphs. Playing hide and seek and running around me laughing. (18 year olds foxy chics.) Amazing!<br /><br />I didn&#039;t drink with the others. only orange juice. They were like more and more and more and more! Lets drink! This fella is having a time of his life! Why aren&#039;t we happy like him? Lets drink more! So typical. And they got pissed. at least the rich guy did. Character one was shutting the fuck up. He is proper scared of hard stuff... character 2 was cool. <br /><br />i was fuckin runnin around with saucer pupills.&nbsp; Clappin, dancin snappin my fingers all the time. Amazing. <br /><br />My question after venting is this: Should i roll alone? Is this situation bad for me? Rolling with nonrollers.<br />I honestly did the roll because of a girl. I just cant talk with her. She is giving me the: &quot;talk with my ugly friend instead!&quot; <br />The ugly is giving me the go (claiming im a nice guy) so Im gonna get to the chick but takes time.&nbsp; Im falling for her big time. And she is into me too. She smells amazing. It just makes me dizzy. Aww i wanna lick her pussy so much.....<br />but she was not there. so I ended up rolling with these guys....<br /><br />any thoughts? (im still rolling) 8)<br />

				Uhh, so it sounds like you had a good time, but I don&#039;t think taking drugs is going to get you any girls... unless they are on them too! But yeah I mean rolling alone and with no-drug types are both situation I try to avoid. I like to at least be with somebody on the same drug as me. If I was drinking and wanted to do some drugs I would just pass them out to everybody. Then I&#039;ve got company, and they&#039;ve got free drugs, and it&#039;s a good night.

				What??? so were there chicks there or not im so confused... .<br />I try to space my rolls out atleast 6 weeks or so. atleast. I can feel such an impact on my body for many dayys after if i over do it. (twice in a period of a few days, or if i redose a few times in a night.) Sleep pattern gets fucked, loss of appetite for a week or two. Two days after i sometimes feel like my body is falling apart. (weak joints, tremors even). The shit definitely isnt harmless as some say.<br /><br />That said, when&nbsp; i do roll, i want to get the most out of it. I do that by rolling with close friends and do it while were doing something fun, not just some random get together. The next time i roll i plan on doing it on 4/20. Me and my closest friends will be going the nearest major city (couple hour drive, we dont go there often), were there is loads of shit to do unlike the small city were i am from. Its always an awesome experience. <br />Sounds like your using x as a crutch in social situations. It can be tempting but i feel like it could land u up in a bad place fast. Plus i dont think a girl thats not rolling is gonna think very much of some guy on hard drugs talking his head off.<br />Rolling alone would be quite boring i feel... The conversations u can have are so much better if you are rolling with others. U just dig off eachothers vibes so much u feel like u know exactly what there feeling/talking about<br />If your rolling on a regular basis it really takes away the magic of it i feel.

				Well doesn&#039;t sound like your idea of a fun time and mine are remotely similar. Which is a-ok. People are different.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my rule for rolling with non-rollers - whatever I&#039;m on has to put me in a state where I can interact in a way that doesn&#039;t make it 100% certain (50% is fine) that I&#039;m on something. Do I want non-rollers knowing that I&#039;m on something, and even what I&#039;m on? Fuck no. Way too vulnerable while rolling, and ever after. Especially with characters you don&#039;t seem to trust.<br /><br />Now, ideal situation: rolling with your best buds. If you can&#039;t have that, I say roll/trip alone. This third option is sucky and dangerous. But YMMV.<br /><br />And with the right girl? Magic. With a new girl? Uber-dangerous. You&#039;d be safer playing five finger fillet with a blind man.

				Edit: Troll Alert<br /><br />Well, I already thought of a reply after reading only your subject: I always use a dollar bill to roll my joints.... but you weren&#039;t talking about that kind of rolling...<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend MDMA to many people... unless they controllably refrain from abuse. MDMA and the like are not drugs that are recreational... they are spiritual, like LSD, DOx, mescaline, shrooms... I don&#039;t recommend frequent use of them. They are the most powerful spiritual teaching tools on Earth, and should be treated with respect....<br /><br />Sorry... I trolled this one, I know...

				lol this thread continues.<br /><br />The ppl i rolled with.. The ppl i met during that first experience... they all think im gay. <br />I dont really know what to do. Should i tell them something? <br /><br />Its kinda funny. they liberated me sexually. I could be gay if i wanted to...but im not.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Anyways i think i will tell them that I fuck everything.<br />&nbsp;that should make them shut up!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />(an old sailor once told me: &quot; I would fuck the mice if i could catch them!&quot;)

				im gonna finish up this thread with me winning on life.&nbsp; ::) <br /><br />I have defeated a collective consciousness that tried to take me over.... gossip.... they really wanted me to be gay. oh well...<br /><br />Don&#039;t play mind games with an acid head!<br /><br />on the more serious note.. Humans are machines. I&#039;m 100 percent sure now. <br />if aliens come to the planet they are not gonna see us as more than that. And we will not see them.&nbsp; <br /><br />and&nbsp; programing a persons mind is the easiest thing ever. <br />Tim Leary was right.&nbsp; About the circuits and about the incoming signals. <br />be very careful.&nbsp; Everything that sends signals has an effect on your mind. <br />wind blowing, crows flying. people whistling. eye contact. everything.
