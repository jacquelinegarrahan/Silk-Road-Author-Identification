WinstonWolfe here seems to simply be reselling their product for between a 30% to 100% markup.&nbsp; (Which I&#039;m actually not going to knock -- he&#039;s still providing a decent service for people living in states or countries where salvia can&#039;t be shipped legally, and deserves to make some cash for his risk. I&#039;m simply knocking the color code, which makes it very difficult to compare their products or prices against anyone else&#039;s.)<br /><br />I live in a state where Salvia&#039;s legality is sort of iffy, and some sites seem willing to ship salvia to me and some aren&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;Arena Ethnobotanicals is one that doesn&#039;t, or I&#039;d have ordered from them, as their site is the least cheesy of all the ones I found.&nbsp; <br /><br />As it is, I ended up ordering from Salvia Hut.&nbsp; Decent prices (a &quot;party pack&quot; with a gram each of 20X, 40X and 60X was about $60) and it arrived within two days with no problems.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only tried the 20X so far, and that alone knocked me on my ass -- I&#039;ll do a trip report in another post.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ah. Yeah, I saw after I posted that you were a vendor with some United Kingdom listings on the Road.&nbsp; Which is awesome and I wish you luck, despite having nothing to do with the question asked in the subject line.

				sagewisdom.org/salviashop.html<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if he sells what you&#039;re looking for, but I have ordered kratom a bunch of times and it always came through/was real. I did a lot of internet research beforehand and his stuff is supposed to be &#039;high quality&#039; (apparently) but I cannot say if the salvia is good or not (haven&#039;t tried it).

				Just make sure you check and see what states have laws against it. I don&#039;t think the DEA has ever added Salvia to the list of controlled substances, so states began taking the initiative and banning it themselves.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just checked. SALVIA IS STILL UNCONTROLLED (LEGAL) UNDER FEDERAL DRUG LAW. Like I said though, you need to check and see if your state has its own laws against it.

				Hello, i have received 1g of salvia 30x , i was very thankful for PlutoPete because it was new years eve, but unfortunately, this was not salvia or maybe it was salvia 1x.<br /><br />I have dosed 0.2 g using a torch lighter and all the needed tools, well am not a first time user of salvia, but nothing happened, REALLY I FELT NOTHING. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what happened, why he fucked me or if this was a mistake.<br />Man this is a sacred plant, not tool to scam people.

				Just to clarify--Salviazone.com, whose products I have been reselling, are the only suppliers I have found that tell you what the ACTUAL, standardized&nbsp; concentration of active ingredient (&quot;salvinorin A&quot;) their products contain.&nbsp; When you buy a &quot;10x&quot; salvia product, that just means that the salvia content has been concentrated by a factor of ten;&nbsp; Salviazone&#039;s products list the concentration in mg/g.&nbsp; For example, the &quot;blue&quot; product contains 120mg/g salvinorin A; the &quot;black&quot; contains 160mg/g.<br /><br />I hope that clears up the apprehension people have had about the color coding...<br /><br />Since this is pretty much the extent of my salvia expertise, (aside from personal experiences), I&#039;m not going to regularly list salvia products any more.&nbsp; I&#039;ll provide a link to stealth listings upon request, but it&#039;s just not worth the hassle to list the stuff regularly.<br /><br />WW

				I have them listed as stealth items because I just kinda got tired of explaining the color coded thing, and because, unlike other products I list I can&#039;t personally vouch for the relative strengths of the different color levels.&nbsp; I mean, a percocet is a percocet, and a norco is a norco, but I can&#039;t directly compare the &quot;blue&quot; to a 40x, or whatever.&nbsp; I want to make the salvia available to people who want it and understand the dosage system, but I don&#039;t want to sell something that someone might be disappointed in.&nbsp; I gave away a bunch of low-strength samples a month or so ago so that folks might know what to expect and to make the color scheme a little less sketchy-sounding.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, anyone that&#039;s interested can pm me for the links, I&#039;m just not actively promoting it anymore.&nbsp; Hope that makes sense..<br /><br />ww
