				Hi guys, i know its been a while since my last post but have been VERY busy lately with work and what not.<br />I was wondering, if there were a particular kind of software, simple at best, that a group of people could use safely on TOR that still retains our anonymity, VOICE/IM based kind.<br />Currently it appears, that the only option is to configure something like Xchat or Mirc to use TOR nodes.<br />However, more and more servers are banning the use of TOR related programs, as i evidently found out today!.<br />So, is there a simple, maybe even crude, solution to this problem?.<br />Has anyone thought it possible to build a small program from scratch?.<br />While a nice little IRC chat is nice, sometimes its just better to talk about things in real time!.

				As far as I know there is no way to have audio conversations over the Tor network. I don&#039;t think it would work well because Tor traffic is bounced through relays all over the world. The delay would be horrible.

				TOR is not designed for real-time stuff like VoIP because connections have latencies of well over several seconds.

				Okay, thanks for the responses.<br />The idea of time delay didnt occur to me.<br />I&#039;m guessing there are no real secure means of doing this on clearnet?.<br />&nbsp;

				Go for teamspeak...Teamspeak is very similar to Ventrilo and Gamechat VoIP&#039;s. However Teamspeak is alot more developed, safer, and reliable.<br />Teamspeak cannot be used for others to inject malicious software into your computer or spy on your computer as it only accesses a port on your computer solely for sending and receieving packets sent by Teamspeak.

				Thanks for this!<br />Would you mind if i used your info as a quote to those who i am trying to persuade?<br />I just need to know if its absolutely fool proof though.&nbsp; Not that im worried about someone spying on my computer, but someone listening in to voice traffic is a different matter.<br /><br />BTW, your clip of the joker is awesome!.

				Yeah, go ahead. Unfortunately I can&#039;t tell you it&#039;s 100% safe. However if the LE know what you&#039;re up to and they&#039;re already watching you it is possible that they can listen to your conversations. As long as you know nobody&#039;s watching you it&#039;s fine. There are hundreds of thousands if not millions of servers on Teamspeak, I don&#039;t think all of them are watched considering that owning your server (being the administrator) you can limit the access and put passwords so no one can join the conversation. + It&#039;s something that gamers are using to communicate as it&#039;s using way less resources than skype and it&#039;s not as laggy as skype or other software. Why would LE supervise a software that kids are using to play counter strike?

				I reckon war games get monitored a lot.<br />Think about all those jihadist clerics out there who could talk advantage of young kids over a voice networked game.&nbsp; They become friends, after enjoying the action and its suddenly like &quot;how would you like to do this shit for real&quot;??
