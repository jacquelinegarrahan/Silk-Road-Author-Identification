				So.... who is everyone in the US going to be voting for this November?&nbsp; In my eyes the only sensible choice is Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Candidate.&nbsp; I refuse to pick the &quot;lesser of two evils.&quot;<br /><br />Here is what he stands for: (Clearnet) http://www.ontheissues.org/gary_johnson.htm<br /><br />So who are you voting for and why? <br />

				so I guess none of you guys are voting then...&nbsp; &nbsp;I know it seems like a vote for Gary Johnson or any 3rd party candidate will be a wasted vote but its actually the other way around.&nbsp; Voting for Romney or Obama if you dont believe in what they stand for is a wasted vote. <br />Oh well, Sheeple will be Sheeple.&nbsp; Samuel L Jackson put it best &quot;Wake the FUCK up America.&quot;

				I am a die hard Ron Paul advocate and did a lot of grassroots campaigning for him in my State during the primary. I&#039;ll be voting GJ also and so will the other 700+ supporters in our County database.<br /><br />Although I am at a crossroads in my mentality towards the political simulation. A part of me thinks that hope feeds this monster just as much as fear does and that it is so far entrenched in corruption that our only viable option now is a dramatic phase shift in society and allow this &quot;system&quot; we&#039;ve conjured up to wither and die.<br /><br />It will get very bad before it gets any better. I&#039;ve stopped most of my energy into politics now and focus on guns, gold and gardens. The most important positions in your local scene you should be VERY concerned who hold them is going to be your Treasurer and Sheriff -- after that if everyone would stop joining the military, grow their own food locally and stop paying your income tax let alone use the FRN&#039;s -- What the fuck can national politics do anymore? Absofuckinglutely nothing. <br />

				I would hope that everyone who understands the significance of this website would consider themselves libertarian. Personally, as a sub-category of libertarianism, I believe in a political ideology known as anarcho-capitalism, as does DPR himself. <br /><br />Now to answer your question, I will be voting for Gary Johnson, in fact, I would like to let it be known (especially to any media outlets&nbsp; :D) that Doctafeelgood hereby officially endorses Gary Johnson for president!<br /><br />With that out of the way, I&#039;d like to note that I am only voting to send a message to the powers that be. I would like them to know how many of their tax-cows are migrating toward libertarian beliefs. I would like them to understand that their time as puppet-masters is limited, and a resistance is brewing in the subconscious of the collective. <br /><br />Would I blame anyone for not voting? Of course not. The state is a criminal organization, and the electoral process is a joke. It&#039;s actually hard to bring myself to participate in such a meaningless distraction designed to make the sheeple feel free. But as long as there is actually somebody with libertarian views on the ballot, I will give him my vote. <br /><br />To those of you who think voting for Robamney is a good idea, I feel actually pity and sorrow in my heart for you. Odds are your brainwashed and in need of some serious reading (PM me for reading assignments), or you fully understand the evil of the state, and you are a morally bankrupt person who enjoys the idea of using force, fraud, and coercion to push your beliefs on others. If that is the case, you won&#039;t enjoy the future, for mankind will evolve to embrace absolute freedom, and statism will become a bad memory of the past. <br />

				I am voting for Gary Johnson because votesmart.org told me that his beliefs and my beliefs are 78% compatible while Obama and Romney both were ~40% (Obama beat Romney by 1%) That is a clear winner for me. I urge people to check out votesmart.org and take their candidate quiz just to see how compatible you and the candidate you have probably already chosen truly are. <br /><br /><br />but feel free to write in wretched :) I hope at least one ballot has wretched written in!

				To everyone voting for Gary Johnson (or some other minor party candidate): I hope you live in a solidly red or blue state, so your vote doesn&#039;t go to waste.<br /><br />I&#039;m voting for Obama and a straight Democratic ticket.&nbsp; Why? Because the GOP needs to stay the hell out of my vagina. Control over our reproductive health is the cornerstone of women&#039;s freedom, and I have watched with dismay as the GOP has chipped away at women&#039;s reproductive autonomy these past couple of years. I live in a swing state and so, as much as I would love the luxury of voting for a boutique candidate like Johnson, I just can&#039;t take the risk that more Republicans will come into power and strip yet more of our hard-earned rights away.<br /><br />&quot;Legitimate rape&quot;? Screw you, Todd Akin.

				i feel like both parties are the same so it doesn&#039;t matter who i vote for. I can vote for Gary Johnson, but i know we are a small minority and will only get 1% or 2% of the vote.&nbsp; so the question is - does voting for Johnson help Romney? probably not in my state.&nbsp; Obama or Romney? unfortunately those are our only realistic choices.

At the very least you&#039;ll feel better about yourself.
