				Sometimes packages can be slow, but it can be for any number of reasons from inaccurate &quot;in transit&quot; reports to the postal service itself. Regardless I don&#039;t bug the vendors right away about it unless something is uncharacteristically slow

				Aren&#039;t you a little young to be partaking in drugs? Serious observation. It&#039;s not wise to do drugs while your brain is still developing, my friend. There can be repercussions on overall cognitive ability if you continue. Save it for early adulthood.<br /><br />Also, easy with the dosage on Tramadol. 500mg is dangerously high. Stick with 200/250mg.

				You sir, are a disgrace to the drug community. Do yourself a favor and break free from all of your addictions, after which you should abandon drugs altogether until you wise up. Fo real dawggg. ::)

				Take the other posters advice man and give it all a break so you can develop yourself, your personality, your faith in yourself, your self worth, your pride and all that, You may think you know the score after five years of this and that but the best advice to take is advice from people who have been in the exact same position that you are now.<br /><br />I dont mean to be patronising at all either but your only a young lad, absolutely full of potential and this is obviously hindering you. Drugs are great, you can take them again and enjoy them even more but some &quot;off&quot; or &quot;me&quot; time is necessary if your so young and 5 years on &quot;it&quot; full time, they are 5 important years! Again im not trying to be all high and mighty or patronising its your body and your choice!

				are you like one of those people who just discovered 4chan or something?<br />i have a high opiate tolerance (not in the dick measuring kinda way but for reference) but the times i took it when my tolerance was at it&#039;s highest anything about 100 mgs made me violently sick and 25-50 did nothing. not even pain relief. that&#039;s a stupid attitude to have because i assure you it&#039;s never to late to fix yourself and your body. <br /><br />you need to take a break or something.<br />you&#039;re going to die dude.<br /><br />not trying to sound all AA syndrome on you. i&#039;m just talking from experience.
