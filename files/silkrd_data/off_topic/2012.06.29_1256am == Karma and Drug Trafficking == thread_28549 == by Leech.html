				<div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">Please refrain from non-productive and insulting replies. Experienced vendors are encouraged to input. <br /><br />Thanks.<br /></code><br />I have seen the scene for quite some time. And who is to agree, mishaps often happen to dealers in real life, not only in the Road? If you ask any long term, experienced vendors in real life or especially Heroin dealers, about bad karma, or integrity associated with trafficking drug, they will tell you they believe karma is very true.<br /><br />How many times have you heard a vendor has &quot;met with a car accident&quot;, &quot;hospitalized&quot;, &quot;goods stolen&quot;, even &quot;fell down the stairs&quot; or suffer other ill fate? Most old dealers (especially Heroin dealers) will say it&#039;s karma. It&#039;s rumored that several top drug lords are partially disabled (may not be true). I hear old time dealers will regularly donate to the cause of charity to lighten this karma. In real life, the terms which happen to friends the junkies will hear often are jail terms, sentences, OD, death, accidents, etc. IMO drugs are not bad things.<br /><br />On top of that, I believe people who intentionally scam others in the name of trading drugs will certainly meet their fate in due course. Thus, if everyone here would deal honestly, with minimal scam, and hopefully more good karma flourishes.

				I think perhaps it is the other way around.<br /><br />People who are prone to negative karma and who often have a dark cloud over them at most times are drawn to this type of behavior.<br /><br />These types of things were happening to these people long before they were involved in any illicit activity.
