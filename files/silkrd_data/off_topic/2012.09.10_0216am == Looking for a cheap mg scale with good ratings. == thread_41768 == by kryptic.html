				My Myweigh GemPro-250 scale seems to have crapped out on me. they do offer 30 years warranty but i need to get a new scale ASAP. i cannot wait until they fix it or send me a new one. the cheaper the better. maybe i should look on ebay?

				There are 1 mg scales for 20 dollars on amazon. I don&#039;t know the exact name but they work really well with an error margin of only around +/- 2 mg.<br /><br />If you need a really fine tuned mg scale then yea you need to pay alot.

				When I was in Thailand I searched high and low for one. I found heaps of digital ones accurate to 0.01 and only one (after HOURS) that was accurate to 0.001g.<br />It wasn&#039;t too expensive but the guy brought it out and before I could stop him started bashing on the plate! Pushing it really hard a few times anyway. I didn&#039;t want to buy one that he had done that to every time a potential buyer had a look so I gave it up.<br /><br />You could also look for old school ones. They&#039;re heavy and bulky and require a bit of fiddling but you could get one accurate to 0.0001g for $50. I think one brand is sartorius?

As a side note I needed to weigh out some molly and I do not have a mg scale nor do I trust my little cheapo digital scale at .1 mg resolution so I got out my powder scale that I use in cartridge reloading it weighs in grain weight all the way down to a tenth of a grain since a grain is about 64 mg I weighed out 2 grains and popped that shit in a gelcap worked perfect.
