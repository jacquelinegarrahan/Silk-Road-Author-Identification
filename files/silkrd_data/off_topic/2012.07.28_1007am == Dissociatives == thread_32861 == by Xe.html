				The original idea is having a thread about dissociative state in general<br />not about any special substance..<br /><br />Anybody? How do you feel it? Have anything to say?<br />New twisted thoughts from dissociative minds are welcome!<br /><br />DXM aka Dextromethorphan..<br />Been extensively researching this chemical for about a year.<br />That one can teach a lot if approached with respect..<br />So much wisdom.. That much grace.. Beautiful thoughts..<br /><br />The same dissociative class as ket or newly arrived mxe. Aesthetic anesthetics. <br /><br />The way i see &#039;em as universal addiction breakers.. Deprogramming agents..<br />For any physical or psychological addictions or thinking patterns in general.. <br />Personally helped me a lot in dealing with my nicotine addiction and alcohol craving.<br /><br />Constant flow of insights and sparks of consciousness is another bright side..<br />I believe that particular kind of chemistry is sort of underground in underground..<br /><br />There&#039;s a divine spark of genius in everyone of us from the very birth..<br />Will we be able to recognize it and bring to full blossom it&#039;s up to us..<br />That&#039;s tough following the call of a genius inside, ever seeking the path..<br />This chemistry can help to those who create and determined in doing so..<br />To people involved in creating instead of consuming, art people,<br />painters, designers, bringers of the beauty from another dimension.<br /><br />Been looking for any sources of information about dissociatives.<br />Haven&#039;t found that much on the subj but there&#039;s a great book available<br />from ketamine priestess Marcia Moore 1978 Journeys into the Bright World..<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for individuals who are willing to gain higher understanding<br />of these substances and share their insights with the others on the path..<br /><br />Related to DXM there&#039;s smth interesting: DXMZine@dextroverse

				i spent a good year chugging up on that tuss before moving onto dxm powder and then mxe for 9 months or so. i&#039;ve tried ketamine a couple times but i dunno... i didn&#039;t like it as much. and (maybe i got shitty k but) it tastes like fucking petrol up my nose and made me gag. <br /><br />i&#039;ve not done mxe since march. there was an incident where i overdid it and came back to consciousness covered in cuts and bruises. been quite turned off doing it since.

				Oh man please be more careful..<br />It is true this kind of medicine requires higher responsibility than anything else..<br /><br />The other wonderful side that i&#039;ve discovered on dxm is the occult content of the experience..<br />It shows a way and gives a drive for searching any kind of hidden knowledge, psychology and alchemy for me..<br />Sometimes higher meaning opens up just about anything around.. A genuine obe experience beyond belief.. <br />As well as esp phenomena in form of synchronicities when inner and outer states interfere.. Coincide..<br />I would say fate aligning, the term i coined myself and haven&#039;t seen anywhere else before..<br /><br />Haven&#039;t managed to get a hold of k or mxe myself yet.. Though have read a couple of books about k..<br /><br />Is special k better than anything? Hmm.. I would say it&#039;s a truer dissociative as far as i know...<br />But sure enough only personal experience can become a point of view on that matter..<br /><br />

				<br />Dxm to me is a lame trip. Was funny he first few times while robo-walking, after a while got sick of it. Its not a recreational drug to me.

				Actually Dxm has dosage dependent plateau effect which makes it appear like three different substances..<br />Each state has its unique set of effects and thought patterns.. Levels of access to information..<br /><br />At low doses, first or low second plateau, it has property of a mild stimulant.<br /><br />Second plateau can be compared to a subtle psychedelic state..<br /><br />While at higher plateaus, third and beyond, this medicine shows its true dissociative nature splitting mind and body..<br />Going into the state of k,m or d-hole.. There&#039;s no robo or any other kind of walking possible in these higher states..<br /><br />There&#039;s a point in experiencing all these three different facets of dxm before crystallizing an opinion about it..<br /><br />Personally i would never be able to say lame about it.<br />Third plateau experience is always so profound and lifechanging that makes me question everything i think i know..<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely not a recreational substance. Not for being involved in any social activities under influence.<br />More for psychonauts, researchers of the mind, who take journeys in order to gain higher knowledge about<br />themselves, about the way our mind works and for better understanding of the laws of the universe around us..

				<br />I am aware of what plateaus are. As for psychonauts, I think its rather weird to be dependent on any substance to gain knowledge. A psychedelic experience is what you make out of it, anything other than that is a fool`s whim. You can research yourself, the mind and journey all you want, nevertheless you can never change the laws around you. I think most are absorbed into this thinking a new plateau will give them knowledge that is unattainable to sober individuals. If anything a psychonaut`s discoveries and ramblings can only be related among individuals practicing the same/similar chemical. Most true laws/backed-up theories/philosophy came from those who questioned themselves relentlessly to find a better answer. Drugs on the other hand are all forms of escapism. <br /><br />I`m not gonna lie,&nbsp; I do like experiences of all kinds but all this so called &#039;knowledge&#039; is as good as worshiping a deity. You can`t apply that knowledge in real life and progress. If we could we all wouldn`t be here wasting hours on such posts.

				No worries mate.&nbsp; I was thinking of LSD but in my brothers younger days he had his drink spiked with the stuff and it really fucked with his head.<br />He was walking home with his friends who did their best to help him but all he could see was the trees reaching out to him like fucking claws.&nbsp; Thats not what i want.<br />Dont worry im going to keep my experiences posted! <br />I have a good feeling its going to be a wild ride.
