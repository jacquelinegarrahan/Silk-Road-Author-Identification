				I don&#039;t want my computer to blow up just for questioning their existence, but i have never come across them. I have only heard about them on a major media outlet i.e the BBC. I would have thought that this place would be a perfect place for them to communicate with each other. And if they are real does anybody know if that was them that &quot;hacked&quot; PSN, and if it was Fuck you! i had no PSN for weeks. Maybe their the cunt that keeps nicking my tictacs out of the fridge.

				&quot;Anonymous&quot; is just the term the media use for general people on the internet that cause havoc and don&#039;t have any affiliations with organisations.<br /><br />It came from 4chan, doing &quot;raids&quot; and &quot;dropping dox&quot; for the lulz. But now its got to the point that any shit that anyone does on the net can be attributed to &quot;anonymous&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s media bullshit with an element of truth, in that people on 4chan do do this sort of shit.

				As far as I&#039;m aware Anonymous are several groups. It has become more of a brand and an idea than just a group. <br /><br />So the question is not &quot;WHO is Anonymous&quot; but &quot;WHAT is Anonymous&quot;. <br /><br />From where I&#039;m sitting, it seems that Anonymous groups share a (justified) distaste for totalitarian regimes and organizations. (A.e. Scientology. A sect that will discriminate and intimidate you at the slightest hint of a negative quote from your side. Hence protesters felt the urge to be Anonymous)

				It&#039;s just a lot of different groups that happen to communicate in the same venues (4chan yes, but most hacker groups are in IRC chats). With that many botnets available, it becomes quite easy to ddos any site/server. I&#039;m sure by now there are those that have flipped the crazyass switch and sit at their computer in their Guy Fawkes mask, happy to be a part of something even if it is just a loosely connected network of people that can contact each other - but my experience has been that any of those claiming to be Anon aren&#039;t knowledgeable enough to even be in the scene, let alone have participated in any ops are all.
