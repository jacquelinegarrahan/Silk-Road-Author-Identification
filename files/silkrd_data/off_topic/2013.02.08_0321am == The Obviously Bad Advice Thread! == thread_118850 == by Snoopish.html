				Yo, <br /><br />So I&#039;m bored and hoping for a new pointless thread and this is the best idea I came up with. In this thread you post a question/concern/issue that is either real or fake and everyone else chimes in with the worst/inappropriate/nonsensical advice possible. For added hilarity, question-askers should come back and reply under the assumption that they followed the advice given and ask follow-up questions to the newly-developed scenario.<br /><br />All those who post real questions/concerns or people who come in expecting helpful/accurate/informative answers should be shamed and then given even worse advice than normal. <br /><br />I&#039;ll start off (and everyone feel free to answer/ask multiple questions at a time because why the fuck not?)<br /><br />My cat and dog don&#039;t get along. One watches TV constantly and likes doing cocaine. The other likes to watch cocaine and do TV. What do I do? <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m heavily addicted to benzos and currently have a quarter gram of pure benzo powder and 5g of methamphetamine. What should I do?

				So I have a girlfriend I am marrying tomorrow and we are planning on dropping a shit load of MDMA / MDA / Shrooms with some GHB, Moxy or Xanax to throw in as needed this weekend. Now my other girlfriend lives out of town and wants me to come visit her next week and do a shit load of drugs with her as well. After that I have this other girl I play with on the side and I&#039;m going to see her a few days after the second girl to drop some Molly for the first time. <br /><br />Mostly I am interested in harm reduction so:<br /><br />How do I tell my wife on our wedding night that I need to save enough drugs to get my other two girlfriends really fucked up too?

What do I do now?<br /><br />DS--How much Xanax do you have? If you have enough to go around, don&#039;t explain anything to your wife and just hit her with about 20mg of xanax and have her wash it down with the wedding champagne: she&#039;ll be relaxed and won&#039;t mind you being gone for a bit. If you don&#039;t have that much xanax replace xanax with GHB and have her drink twice as much champagne. <br /><br />BoS--I got nothing. DS gave you the best advice possible here. Definitely start dosing him with MDMA but also add an equal amount of MDA to his other vitamins and some Methylone to a third. That was he loves you faster. <br /><br />

				I have just walked in to a police station with 25 grams of MDMA in my pocket, and a syringe filled with my home made heroin/steroid mix in my arm. <br /><br />I have told them I have a bomb in my bag, and if they do not give me the contents of the evidence cupboard so I can sell it on SR I will blow everything/everyone up.<br /><br />They have told me I was drunk and to go home, what do I do?

				Slick, <br /><br />These guys ain&#039;t taking youse seriously! What&#039;s ya got to do is pump that cocktail into your veins and whip your bomb out and set it to blow by the evidence cupboard! If any cops get too close be sure to grab their gun so they know you still have non-drunk levels of coordination. <br /><br />Also, shove MDMA into anybody&#039;s mouth who is wearing handcuffs--boom--instant legion of followers!

				All right, gave my girlfriend a bunch of Xanax this morning like you all suggested but now she&#039;s just curled up naked on the kitchen floor. I tried pouring some campaign on her since someone mentioned that too but her mom keeps yelling at me and telling me I&#039;m no good for her daughter and the wedding is off. The whole wedding party started to freak out because I laced the coffee with LSD and let them watch The Exorcist while I sorted things out with my girl. Long story short, I have 23 hostages now and a comatose girl friend whom I can&#039;t wait to marry. The SWAT team will not let the officiant enter the property and so I need to find one of those web sites where someone can become ordained online to get be and my girl all married up. The teargas is really starting to sting and some of the guests are talking about wanting to leave early even though the ceremony isn&#039;t supposed to start for another hour. <br /><br />I know this probably is all just a bad case of the pre-wedding jitters. I took a little PCP to help take the edge off but so far I haven&#039;t been able to smoke enough to make the cops leave.

				I think it&#039;s working! Everyone seems really excited and a few tired themselves and are laying where the explosion occurred. The rest are shaking with anticipation! I&#039;m having such a good time that I&#039;m laughing my ass off! It&#039;s getting rather hot though and the sirens outside keep fucking with the mood I&#039;m trying to set. <br /><br />Also, my cat found the coke and is laying in it while my dog barks wildly at the flames. So it&#039;s a success, I think, but I can&#039;t get them to run the live-stream and some of the people are screaming about something. I don&#039;t know---&quot;He shut the FUCK up I can&#039;t hear myself think!&quot; sorry about that. They have no manners--shouting like a bunch of heathens. So what do I do now? And speaking of heathens...<br /><br /><br />My followers are now bringing me drugs and silver paint to continue my charade. I&#039;m extremely thirsty and they keep bringing me drinks but I can&#039;t taste what they bring after the holy water. Anyways, there are these people dressed in uniforms gathering and they look displeased. My followers are keeping them back but I feel they want to stop my religious speeches. What do I do with these blasphemous dogs? <br /><br />(Also, + 1 to you for actually making me laugh out loud at my computer)<br /><br /><br />@BoS: This alien culture is strange and the perfect opportunity to reach a new level of commitment and understanding with your lover. Explain to the aliens, and your lover if need be, that you want to embrace one of the aliens into your marriage and make the world&#039;s most beautiful love triangle. If the aliens aren&#039;t interested in polygamy then dose them with MDMA until they see things your way. Then you can go on a lovely vacation to...whatever is out there! Luck you!<br /><br /><br />@DS: You want to marry this chick? Her family is such a drag! Well anyways, grab your best man and sit him in front of a computer and have him do the online-minister thing. The people complaining about the tear gas will probably give up and collapse into a corner shortly--ignore them unless they try to get out. It would be rude if they left before the vows!<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;d suggest getting more ambitious with your PCP usage--don&#039;t be afraid to start IV&#039;ing that shit and let the guests know how serious you are to marry this girl. Also, the cops may misunderstand your cultural beliefs in terms of marriage ceremonies. Let them know that everything is okay by stuffing napkins in any high-proof, flammable, liquor bottles and lighting the napkins like candles before throwing them out at the cops. That way they will know you are celebrating and happy: hence the fire. <br /><br />You love this woman so don&#039;t let those jitters second-guess your intentions now!<br />

The smoke is pretty thick but I think they all got some of the coke with the smoke they were inhaling. The live stream is hard to see because of the smoke so I opened a window but now the sirens are even louder. Also, water is pouring through the open window! What do I do? (Also, any advice on getting rid of a nagging cough? It just started out of the blue). Oh, and I found a couple posters but didn&#039;t know what shipping option to choose: overnight or standard?<br /><br />2) They resisted my holy blessing of paint and opiates at first but they are now laying blissfully on the ground. Oh here are some people with guns. Perhaps they also want to join my sect? What should I do with these guys? They look angry. Probably confused about their place in the world. <br /><br /><br />New one: I want to get some ice cream. What flavor should I get? <br /><br /><br />BoS: This sounds like a solid time to let the kids learn about the politics of the galaxy. Use your relationship with the aliens to gather a fleet to go enslave earth first and equip the planet with anti-spaceship defenses and gun down some of your children. It&#039;s a tough lesson but one they&#039;ll remember for the rest of their lives. The rest of them will probably take something from this lesson too: sometimes you got to pretend to be nice to get what you want.

But it&#039;s more delightful as a surprise, so approach menacingly with flowers behind your back, ready to whip out your most charming smile and chosen flora of friendliness.<br /><br />The best ice cream is stolen ice cream, and audacity is the richest topping. What could be better than a naked assault on an ice cream vendor on this sun-shiny day? Feel free to chemically enhance the experience if the joy of the endeavour does not provide a boner to be proud of.
