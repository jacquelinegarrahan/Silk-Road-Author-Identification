What&#039;s your SR name? I&#039;ve found the transactions usually go faster that way: it was running a bit slow when I tried to load the account today. <br /><br /><br />

Furthermore, it was likely SR&#039;s commission fee which drove the price up. If you give him you exact price limit and he puts that in, it will be a slightly higher number in the end. Have him set the price a bit lower than what you have, that is if he/she is willing too.<br />Be wary of judging people assholes before you make one of yourself.<br /><br />-Cheers
