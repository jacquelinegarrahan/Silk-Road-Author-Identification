				&nbsp;8) bro.. everyone must follow the code.. we live anonymously so, bringin an ego that doesnt appeal to everyone or anyone. doesnt make a difference... being a client to a vendor is all in positive light. so why feel negative over &quot;Limitless&quot;

				OP you could be one of a few people today. You are either the guy that asked me for samples who I shot to bits for being a cheap fuck, the guy who&#039;s thread I locked for asking for 5BTC or the guy I locked for asking for 2BTC to open a vendor account. <br /><br />Either way, doing any of these really makes you look like a sad panda, a sad, sad sexual harassment panda. <br /><br />Take it on the chin and get the fuck over it.

				lol, yeah, Lim doesn&#039;t fuck around, he is a great poster but sometimes he isn&#039;t the best or least biased mod out there, luckily he is usually right when he calls someone out.&nbsp; I think pretty much everyone here likes him, including me.&nbsp; Anyway yeah, this guy is probably just the beggar from earlier.

I just prefer to be candid as Shroom says because then everyone knows where they stand, what&#039;s the point of walking on eggshells around people? All that does is make people think you are a pussy and can be walked all over, neither of which for me is now or shall ever be the case. Also we are dealing with some pretty hardcore shit here, if people get caught with their pants down using SR you are looking at much more shit if they throw the book at you to make an example. If I see some dumb-ass shit that can FUCK peoples live, the best one lately was when someone was advising another member to call up MoneyPak because they got ripped off then I&#039;m gunna shoot you the fuck down and I wont be saying sorry for it because it&#039;s the only way people learn. Otherwise shit just enters some sort of pseudo-philosophical debate about how we should be free to do stupid shit because the government and corporations are constraining us blah blah fucking blah. Time and a place for talking about that shit and it&#039;s not when people are telling people to do stupid shit that can land them in prison.<br /><br />Generally, if you don&#039;t like me then that&#039;s alright, no worries from me and I don&#039;t really care. We can&#039;t all get on with everyone here but fuck me don&#039;t dwell on it like the OP here did because it makes you look like a bloody pansy. We can happily coexist here without developing vaginas when you have cross words with people lol. <br /><br />Nuff said.

				I am not one of those weak-spirited, sappy Americans who want to be liked by all the people around them. I don&#039;t care if people hate my guts; I assume most of them do.

				Indeed Gaz, this is essentially how I try and live life in general. Popularity contests do not make for strong spines. <br /><br />Now that we have established that some people don&#039;t like me and some people do even though this was a fairly well established consensus anyway I think we can close this thread with the certain knowledge that we have achieved nothing through it and that I don&#039;t care if some people don&#039;t like me anyway.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; 8)
