				All I see is a bunch of derps attempting to run in a circle faster than all the other derps, it&#039;s like, who the fuck are these retards and who was the comedian who convinced them to work their whole lives to run in a circle as fast as possible?&nbsp; Well olympians, your names will go down in history all right, intelligent people will always remember those retards who worked their whole lives to perform some menial task like throwing a spear.&nbsp; Anyway, just wanted to get that off of my chest.

				You know actually im sure many care about the olympics.<br />The olympics is like an art,a art of people from all around can compete.<br />Its like a showing of achievements of various things,like a collage of human abilities.How far a person can jump or how fast a person can run ect.

You Americans may not understand how important this is for me but this is the sort of shit that makes the British rise out of their seat and shed a tear for that&#039;s good in the world and the only other thing that gets us to do that is the Queen or winning at the Rugby or Footer. I mean did any of you watch the opening ceremony? I was THERE in the stadium watching it and it made me want to cry Union Jacks! <br /><br />The Olympics has given the U.K a real reason to be proud to be British, even if it may only last for a little while. Also being proud to be British is different than being proud to be American because it&#039;s a quiet and contemplative affair you feel inside but we are too reserved to make a big show of. There is nothing better than being given a good reason to be proud to be British and being able to say &quot;Fuck you&quot; to Australians. It&#039;s just a beautiful thing.

				Well come on, at least admit that the ads that combine the momentous music from war movies and voice actors from dateline and try and pretend that rome was just conquered piss you off, I mean it&#039;s like shut the fuck up, it&#039;s a sporting event, you didn&#039;t just safe the world from aliens.&nbsp; I mean do people do that for basketball or soccer etc?&nbsp; *SEVEN MEN JUST TREKKED ACROSS THE UNIVERSE FROM THEIR HOME PLANET GALANTOS, AFTER TRAINING FOR 4900 YEARS IN THE BOILING WATER OF THE PIT OF SEVEN HELLS THESE MEN HAVE COME TO OUR PLANET FOR ONLY ONE PURPOSE, TO SWIM IN A WAY THAT MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE DOWN SYNDROME AND DIVE IN A SYNCHRONIZED WAY*

				You may feel that way my friend, but I just can&#039;t be cynical about it like I am cynical about most things. Because something that allows you to say &quot;Fuck you Australia&quot; that much and with that much reason, well my heart just says that whatever can do that must be something good and pure and great. We should cherish it while it lasts.
