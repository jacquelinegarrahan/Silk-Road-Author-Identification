				I&#039;ve been away from the high-quality boro scene for a little while now, but I have a very humble collection. I&#039;m either using my Syn mini with a worked showercap and splashguard, or my US Tubes beaker with a cheap PHX ash catcher. By no means top of the line and innovative, but it does the job for me. :)

				YAY MY FAVORITE TYPE OF THREAD!!! I tried to start one of these, didn&#039;t take off very well&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124195.msg849880#msg849880<br /><br /><br />BUT MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME?! <br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new to the concentrates scene and I&#039;ve been looking for a good oil rig below $300. Any recommendations? I picked up a David Goldstein recently because I thought it would be good for flowers + dabs, but unfortunately I found out it sucks for dabbing. That damn fritted disc is so purifying it almost steals them from you! <br /><br />So, recommendations? Happy to have you here on the road by the way &lt;3

				A dab rig for $300? Hmmm a mothership mini would be my suggestion. Depending on the shop you find them in they range from 300 - 400. Worth every penny, has a built in quartz honey pot! (Youtube :D)<br /><br />I can&#039;t share to much of my glass collection as a lot of it is unique, but I will admit I have some 26 pieces, most of which are by major artist :) <br /><br />My major dabbing rigs are a Mothership Torus, a Mobious double stereo matrix, and mothership mini when I travel! <br />

				Yeah, can&#039;t be to careful! The one you linked is essentially the same the difference is, the one you linked has the mothership perc, the one you want has a showercap (26 slits I believe)<br />[Clearnet]<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ87AwoTPEY<br />[clearnet]<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed them up for sale in used glass groups a lot (Boromarket, and glass groups on facebook) and have been going consistently for $350 there. I recommend checking those out. <br /><br />Have you ever looked up a Sovereignty Recycler?

				Most of my collection is Sov :) <br />Two recyclers, short and tall, 8 arm, 12 arm, two pillars, and some less well known tubes ;) <br /><br />I will say this. Mothership is the only other artist I would consider to be as high of quality as Sov. Those two rules the scientific game. Check this out:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Vpis2P52M -- That shows most of their tubes<br /><br />And there coolest tube -&gt; <br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9zKHOHEktw<br /><br />Did you know Sov&#039;s collabing with HOPS right now?

				Do you use a different piece for dabs than you do for flower?<br /><br />Do you prefer to dab? Ti or glass nail? <br /><br />Or do you prefer flowers? Favorite strain?<br /><br />Whats your opinion on Dave Goldsteins? Ever tried one? They&#039;re fun to watch :)

				Yes, rigs for flower are for flower specifically, and vice versa. The fats &amp; tars in the Trichome are mostly hydrophobic, so when you keep the rig for oil specifically it never builds up a grungy taste. You could turn the thing amber with reclaim, and still on taste the slightly bit of hashyness in the water. <br /><br />In a perfect life I would smoke flower 35% of the time, bubble hash 35%, ice wax 20% of the time and shatter / defatted shatter 10% of the time. That changes progressively, depending on my needs. <br /><br />Out of Ti, Quartz Glass, or Boro their are two clear choices, Quartz or Ti. Borosilicate (glass) is mostly ignored because it shatters / cracks after consistent use of a real torch. Quartz does not. I prefer Quartz to Ti as though it takes longer to heat it heat to a slightly lower consistent temperature, preserving flavor! Also Ti requires &#039;seasoning&#039; for the same reason cast iron pans do, they absorb the oil when heated. <br />I would recommend the quartz honeypot (which can be bought seperately from the mini before mentioned), or a Quartz thermal DI nail. Having tried all ranges of domesless, and non and about every Ti or quartz nail out there. The only one I havn&#039;t tried is the E-Nail by Task Rok. <br /><br />I like all ranges of strains. I think Gage Green Genetics, Kingdom Organic Seeds, DNA Genetics, and a few others are masterful breeders. I love Hindu Kush, Grape Stomper OG, Inferno Haze<br /><br />Goldstiens tube are nice, fritted percs are clever. They clog rather quickly, making grunge off a constant purchase. The pulls is a tad heavy for my lungs once it begins to clog, because my lungs are a tad weak, though I love the diffusion. Very fun to watch indeed :) <br /><br />Same question on you?

				Enlightening answer!<br /><br />I really need to get a separate piece. I&#039;ve been slacking. I recently got a new living situation and moved states and had to leave behind all my old pieces, but I still visit them multiple times a year. I&#039;ve got some BlueDots back home and my Goldstein with me here.<br /><br />Like I said, I&#039;m in the market for an oil rig. The DG was attractive to me because it looked like it could function as both, but after dabbing out of a Toro, I don&#039;t think my DG does dabs the justice they deserve. <br /><br />Also, prior to the last couple months, my exposure to waxes, hashes, and oils has been limited because my home state doesn&#039;t come across those things easily and it was before I ventured onto the road. I&#039;m so happy to be here and I feel like my life has changed now that I get to use this wonderful place. <br /><br />Did you get a chance to check out my dab shots? I think I posted it in my other glassheads thread. Also, in my forum signature is a link to some pics/videos I have of my pieces and products I&#039;ve gotten off the road!

				I did look in on your Reddit page pictures :) Nice man! I must admit, I feel spoiled making my own concentrates. <br /><br />Well, out of the concentrates you&#039;ve tried, what are your favorite forms? Shatter, honeycomb, nectar? Do you prefer indicas or sativas?

I also got some good concentrates from CaliforniaDreams recently. I have 2g more on the way.
