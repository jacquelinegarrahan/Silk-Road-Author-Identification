				If you go for neurology, I would strongly recommend trying to get involved in MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies). They are making some remarkable strides in the legitimization and legalization of psychedelic drugs for medical purposes. And I believe that they are the only Organization to get approval from the DEA for this kind of research in years. Some of their famous stuff so far includes using Ibogaine for opiate addiction and MDMA for PTSD.

				I do think people should be slightly careful giving out this information though.<br /><br />Profiling is occuring, we have to assume (it would be unwise not to).<br /><br />And let&#039;s say you&#039;ve been posting here a while, if you&#039;re not careful you have probably revealed..<br /><br />i) your age<br />ii) your location (and there are levels of specificity)<br />iii) facts about your life (what you do, the sort of venues you frequent, your hobbies)<br />iv) your level of education including any degrees/qualifications<br />v) your history of arrest/criminality<br /><br />That&#039;s some decent information for LE to start with right there. I don&#039;t think you could get exact identities from that but it certainly narrows things down a lot.<br /><br />Any vendors who post a lot should be very very careful.<br /><br />

They are making some remarkable strides in the legitimization and legalization of psychedelic drugs for medical purposes. And I believe that they are the only Organization to get approval from the DEA for this kind of research in years. Some of their famous stuff so far includes using Ibogaine for opiate addiction and MDMA for PTSD.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Trust me, I&#039;m a huge fan of MAPS.
