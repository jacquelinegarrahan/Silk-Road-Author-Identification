				they need to try and make themselves sound more hip.&nbsp; maybe if he had said &quot;I&#039;m all about the Benjamins&quot;&nbsp; instead of his &quot;greens&quot; it would have been plausible.&nbsp; Unless he&#039;s from the UK then, well, i don&#039;t know as I&#039;m not familiar with the vernacular over there.<br />But no, could not be more obvious.

				I agree with phubaiblues. So many people just don&#039;t use their heads and let their eagerness get the better of them. Probably a noob just not thinking things through. If he could obtain BTC, which couldn&#039;t be more easy, he could just find a reputable vendor and set something up. If he&#039;s looking for a front, then he is really not using his head. But I think phubaiblues is right, prematurely, LEO is not a good label and probably forces a lot of plain dumb people to create new accounts and stuff. LEO is definitely here, but noobs don&#039;t really realize the beauty of this site or how things should operate in order to be discreet.<br /><br />Just my .02 BTC<br /><br />TUS

				Maybe he is breeding midget goats for the sex trade, that is a complicated business where you NEED a mentor, believe me!! Lots of &quot;greens&quot; in it for the right people though.

				Lol did I just read a triple fake LE comment.&nbsp; &quot;LE wouldn&#039;t say that&#039;.&nbsp; &quot;No LE would KNOW you would think that so that&#039;s why they WOULD say that&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;But LE would know we would think that LE would know we would think that, so LE wouldn&#039;t say it&quot;.<br /><br />Look it&#039;s pointless to scream LE at every noob posting shit on here.&nbsp; You remember most of you when you first got to SR? All starry-eyed and &quot;holy mother fuck I can legitimately buy fucking drugs on the internet and.... whoa, look at that selection.....&quot; (drool).&nbsp; All it does is piss people off.&nbsp; The trick is to treat EVERYONE like LE but not to go around stomping and yelling about it.&nbsp; If someone posts something innappropriate, safest bet is to chalk it off to newbness or ignorance.&nbsp; Keep LE in the back of your head, not to poke at what other people say, but to watch what you are saying yourself.

				Exactly, thats why the midget goat trade is such a better choice. Far lower penalties and just as good money.
