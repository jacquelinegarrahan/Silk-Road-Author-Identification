				I saw on some contracting sights for motor operated ones that cost around 1000$ which are very large and designed to thousands an hour, so it seems that it isn&#039;t necessarily skillful but you need the right device. If it can be done automatically I would think it could be done manually just at a slower rate. Would a &#039;pollen&#039; presser for hash work sufficiently? Or is there any manual tool that can do it? I&#039;m sure most vendors on here press their own chems, if any could give me advice it would be much appreciated.

				Well i&#039;m not going to be going through a business, and I can mix the stuff myself as I can procure a high duty mixer if necessary, or the stuff I&#039;m getting/have might have been pre mixed. It would just me in a room in my house operating this thing. Its basically like repilling crushed pills. Plus I wouldn&#039;t need to get a license for a tiny tool which is what I&#039;m hoping I can find, similar to pollen pressers. Im sure E pressers dont get licenses or use expensive machines.

				And they results don&#039;t have to medical grade, they just have to stay together until they get into my local customer&#039;s hand.

				Ill take your word for it? Someone already showed me one that he uses to make e tabs, and its not very complicated. I appreciate the advice though.

				I&#039;m planning on getting creative too, like raising my car and then using that weight to press them.
