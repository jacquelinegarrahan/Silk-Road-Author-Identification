				Honestly? We&#039;ve been missing you.&nbsp; ST is falling behind again and DA dissapeared.&nbsp; Honestly, neither of them could hold a candle to you anyway.<br /><br />You should really fire up PF Reloaded and start slinging that good old Badass MDMA again! :P<br /><br />

				Ah, I gotcha.&nbsp; That&#039;s SUPER unfortunate.&nbsp; Well I&#039;m honestly just super glad for you in that case.&nbsp; As much as I really miss the service you delivered to us, I wouldn&#039;t want that service at the cost of your freedom.&nbsp; <br /><br />One way or another you have my true appreciation and sincere gratitude.&nbsp; You honestly changed the MDMA game on the Market FOREVER.&nbsp; In a very good way! :D&nbsp; &nbsp;Selflessly giving to the people of the world(on SR) like you did deserves a fucking trophy.&nbsp; One that We&#039;ll unfortunately never be able to award you with.&nbsp; Still I hope you understand how much you really did for us all.<br /><br />Vendor&#039;s will come and go, but you&#039;ve earned your place in the SR Hall of Fame.&nbsp; Thanks again Brother. :)<br /><br />I DO agree with SpaceCase...

				If it&#039;s really you welcome back sir!&nbsp; 8) Hope you&#039;ve been doing well I miss your badass MDMA haha. I&#039;ve been trying to get an order since November, first I got caught up in dutches problems luckily I got my coins back after waiting about a month. Now I&#039;m currently waiting on an order from HM which was apparently overlooked, they&#039;ve promised to reship and I&#039;m feeling optimistic, but its just been a long wait haha. Miss your generally speedy service and communication.<br /><br />Z

				Pfandleiher,<br /><br />Good to see you back, again. Went to a concert a few weeks ago ( Passion Pit with Matt &amp; Kim ) and I wound up ingesting some leftover stuff I had of yours along with some of AfterHour&#039;s product. Thank you for giving me an amazingly fun evening, something I&#039;ll be remembering for a very long time.

				Pf (or someone pretending to be Pf),<br /><br />Have you seen SuperTrips&#039; claim that you&#039;ve been arrested? Didn&#039;t seem too legit but just wondering.<br />Thanks for the good times while they lasted, enjoy retirement.
