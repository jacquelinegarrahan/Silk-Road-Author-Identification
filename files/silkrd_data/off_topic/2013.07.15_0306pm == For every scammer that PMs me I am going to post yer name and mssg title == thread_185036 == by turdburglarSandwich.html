				Usually if you set your preferences so you cannot be seen online, you don&#039;t get these messages.

				I understand your frustration, but these are all throwaway spammer accounts. Their only goal is to spam these messages then delete the account. Therefore, I don&#039;t really know how much good this is going to do.

				I dunno what good it will do in real life, but I am not going to have my behavior controlled by arseholes with an eye to fuck over their fellow species members. I NEVER go gentle into that good night, but rage against the dying of light. I am a peaceful warrior, but get my Irish up, and then its on, and I will hunt one down to the gates of hell to fuck them in the eye with my boomstick.

				Firstly, can I congratulate you on your forum handle, work of genius.<br /><br />Secondly, as MC Haberdasher said if you turn off your online status and you won&#039;t get sent these stupid PM&#039;s anymore.
