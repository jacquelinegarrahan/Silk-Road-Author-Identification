				Man, apologies to those who this guy burned.<br /><br />However, some people only learn the hard way, and that&#039;s just reality. I learned the hard way with tony76, never FE&#039;ing again. <br /><br />He didn&#039;t really point out any flaws that haven&#039;t already been addressed though.. he didn&#039;t do this to prove a point. If he WAS doing it to prove a point, he would probably refund some of the money he stole. The point has already been proven that vendors who require FE can and will run off with your money. It doesn&#039;t make him look any better just to say &quot;you shoulda followed the rules&quot; and dip.

				From my understanding, OP was the one behind the bloomingcolor account and ripped people off to prove a point, left a message to the community to follow the rules, and dipped.

				If this really is true, I wouldn&#039;t be angry at the man/woman, just hopeful. Hopeful that one day this guy/lady comes to realize the severity of his/her actions towards others and how those actions come back around. I am hopeful that he/she realizes that this didn&#039;t teach anyone a true lesson, but made an ugly spectacle of how humans shouldn&#039;t act towards one another even when they can get away with it. If she/he TRULY did care about the welfare of others, they would have returned the money, and the lesson would have been taught. This was motivated out of greed, and rationalized by a sick mind. I hope that one day you come around bloomingcolor, or whoever you are, and realize that you really only screwed yourself over. I have my fingers crossed for you. <br /><br />Karma

				Fuck me i just came across this thread.<br />I thought guys down here would be a little more chilled out.&nbsp; Great way to go, ripping people off.&nbsp; Fucking idiot.<br />Stealing is stealing.&nbsp; Just because you use the excuse of making a point with it, doesnt give you the right to take what is not yours.<br />Its just as bad as robbing a little old ladies house while shes gone out.&nbsp; Just as bad as stealing a handbag from a pregnant woman.<br />Life is fucking shit.<br />

				I dont think its a question of people believing who it is, its WHAT WAS DONE thats pissing people off.<br /><br />From my own experience the universe doesnt care about karma.<br />You do good and look after someone in bad times and then later they still fucking shaft you and make you feel like shit.

				Well another scam has come and gone, and all this anger and hate for things that could have been easily avoided.&nbsp; Hopefully next time we get a little smarter, but good luck to all those that lost a large portion of money, and a sincere fuck you to whoever was behind it, whether password really did it or not it doesn&#039;t matter.
