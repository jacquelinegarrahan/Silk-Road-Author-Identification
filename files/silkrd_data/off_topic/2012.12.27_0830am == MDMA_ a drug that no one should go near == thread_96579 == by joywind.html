				Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve never used MDMA, and I never will.<br /><br />Thursday I was drinking a bottle of beer at a bar, talking about politics and such with one of the waitresses. Then up comes two men I hardly even know.<br /><br />One of these men starts talking to me and he nearly has his head on my right shoulder. I could feel the fag&#039;s breath on my neck. I politely push him away, without any violence.. I ignored the other man. Finally he said, &quot;Why are you ignoring me?&quot; <br />Anyway, if there hadn&#039;t been witnesses, I would have killed them both with a pool cue.<br /><br />What is the deal? This: They were both on MDMA! <br /><br />This is a fucking jew drug. I&#039;ve read that most MDMA comes from Israel. Those fucking jews are really, and I mean really, insidious.

MDMA makes people love everyone indiscriminately. If you love everyone indiscriminately, then you will want open borders, socialism, redistribution of wealth, etc, etc. The Jews support these policies because they corrupt our society and make the populace easier to control.

The creator loves his creations. If the universe is a simulation, the big bang is the beginning. Our universe supports the random happenings of life spawning by freak-accident from inorganic atoms. If it was created by will and not by chance, that means the creator wanted life to exist. That also means that any life is part of such a creator&#039;s design, or hopeful design.<br /><br />Such a creator would want us to all work together. That&#039;s what the truth is. Also, never touched LSD in my life. This is the truth, you&#039;re just full of hate an bigotry. Or poorly-worded satire. Or schizophrenia.

I&#039;m all for atheists and I find most theists unobjectionable as well. I disagree with some of their beliefs, mostly the ones that say the universe is a fantastimagorical place that was created 5K/6K/14K years ago, to the exact point it would have been at if it had come from the big bang...<br /><br />I mean... that&#039;s either stretching it or they&#039;re right. But if they&#039;re right then that means God created a universe and built it so that the general scientific conclusion, based on lots of math and physics and generally-accepted theories about the state of matter and how everything is or could possibly be, would be for us to not believe in him(or her{or it}).<br /><br />No matter how I try to think about God, it always comes back to either &quot;God doesn&#039;t exist&quot; or &quot;God loves the fuck out of us and also doesn&#039;t want us to know he exists, but we should be helping not only each other but every form of life we can.&quot;<br /><br />And science, in its infinite wisdom, is going to help us get away from creature-murder and get down to cellular-slaughter only. That is to say, lab-grown meat. Eventually we might have matter-replicators to make our meat and that&#039;s when we&#039;ll really be helping other life out. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m not a vegetarian and I never will be, but I&#039;m going to be the first and most dedicated labmeatitarian once that stuff is on the shelves.
