				Omg yes... it wasnt that long ago to be honest, i had set some goals for myself, (loosing a shit load of weight), I had dropped from 130 KG (286 lbs) to 91 KG and i was fuckkin tired of dieting...<br /><br />While i was on my health kick i avoided alllll drugs....<br /><br />But my friend took me out to this new bar that had opened up in town some time in July, and made me pop my first pill EVER.... i still remember feeling like every single atom in my body was vibrating with the music...<br /><br />Also i think i did quite well for my first roll, cus as i was coming up, my friend was like &quot;Im all jealous!!! you&#039;re coming up and im not...Do you want another one...&quot;<br /><br />Fuckin hell, first time on E, and i had double dropped within 40 minutes of taking the first pill...<br /><br />Later that night, i was standing outside smoking, and my friend was like &quot;Stop dancing&quot;<br /><br />I reply &quot;BUT THERE IS MUSIC&quot;<br /><br />He replies &quot;We&#039;re in the smoking area idiot...there is no music&quot;<br /><br />I had to work very hard to stay still..;<br /><br />But ive been rolling every 2-3 weeks since then, and loving every bit of it!!!

				It was on this festival. Dropped 3/4 (I think) of a fairly strong pill and waited for at least an hour. At this point my hopes and excitement has gotten pretty low, and this resulted in me loving at so much more once it kicked in. I didn&#039;t know much about it, and was expecting a smooth, more paced-out come up like it is with weed. <br />Instead it just hit me hard, and my state changed in under 5 seconds from completely sober to euphoric, feeling great, and SO talkative.<br />I can go through an evening with &quot;colleagues&quot; without saying a word for hours if they dont ask me anything, I just cant think of anything I could contribute to the conversation with, no matter what the current theme is. I know these people for 3 years, see them almost everyday, we are friends and everything. This just sucks real bad. There are like 3 or 4 people in my whole life I&#039;m comfortable being around, and can actually have normal conversations.<br />&nbsp;On mdma I instantly started talking to whoever the fuck was around me, and had no problems keeping the conversation up. This was around 9pm. Not that much more to talk about, had a classic, great roll...smoking up random people, running around with lightsticks...oh I smoked so much weed through the night...ate another pill at about 1am. Kept me going until about 2:30. Not wanting this to ever end, I popped another full - no effects this time. Spent the next 10 or so hours just sitting/lying around with friends.<br />&nbsp;I was stupid enough not to bring a tent with me, so when it got to 30C+ and I sat on a direct sun for hours with no lake or shit around to cool myself down, already feeling drained and fried from the MDMA, I went home. The trip home was a little hell, but...COMPLETELY WORTH IT!<br />&nbsp;:)
