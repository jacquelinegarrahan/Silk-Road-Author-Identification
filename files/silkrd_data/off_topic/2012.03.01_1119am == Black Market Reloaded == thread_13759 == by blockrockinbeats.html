				I read about this darkweb site in one of the threads on alternatives to SR.<br /><br />I decided to wander over there today to check it out.<br /><br />It was like a barren wasteland! Not many products listed, not many vendors, and next to no posts on the forums.<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided to well and truly stick with SR for obvious reasons, but just wondering if anyone can give a bit more info about BMR?<br /><br />How old is the site? What is its history? Why isn&#039;t it very populated with buyers/sellers? Is it more or less secure than SR? What is the ratio of scams vs. successful transactions that have been reported? What do you predict for its future - do you think it will grow over time into something that is comparable to SR?<br /><br />One feature I noticed on their product listings is that &quot;Questions to seller&quot; are published along with the seller&#039;s answers regarding the specifics of individual products and shipping info. That is quite useful, in my opinion, but I can see how it could pose some security risks, and be too difficult to publish/maintain if the seller had a high volume of questions being asked.<br /><br />Oh, and for those who are fiending for liquid LSD - I also noticed a guy on BMR selling small bottles of it for around $600 each, but only has 2 available, and I couldn&#039;t see any feedback, so I guess it would be too risky for some.

				from what i see over on BMR is just something small trying to start out. i myself opened up a sellers account because the amount of shrooms i have to get rid of dont justify buying a SR sellers account. although i have a feeling i would be sold out over here on SR. there are just not alot of buyers on there. honestly everyone should just approach with some common sense. or just sit back and wait for BMR to grow with time the reputable vendors will prove themselves or just make enough to switch over to SR like i plan to. so yeah do a favor and hop on over to BMR and check out my listings. my user name is the same over there and on their forum.

				Yeah, I was curious what else tor held, so I looked up as many other drug sites as I could...<br /><br />Like you said, barren wasteland. Some are just text-file directories with prices, they all look sketchy as hell. I saw another SR seller (or a guy posting as an SR seller) on one of them, selling the same products. So I guess some are branching out, but for now, SR has all I need and is a dozen times more &#039;open&#039;<br /><br />I think we should all keep in mind DPR state of the road address though - a well-made site and frequent business isn&#039;t an excuse to get comfortable.

				i do have a seller/ buyer account on bmr since a couple of days, because i thought that there could be also a way to make some good cash via bitcoin, but actually i&#039;ve figured out in a couple of minutes that this place is dead as hell... there are hardly sellers with more than 1-2 feedback... also lots of scam reports i&#039;ve read... you also need to allow cookies in your browser if you want to log in to the site successfully... that&#039;s a high security leak i guess... for silk road you can just activate temporary cookies, which is way not that dangerous...<br />personally i&#039;ll take a look at this place once a months... maybe it will get better...&nbsp; ::)<br />&nbsp;

The page is so frequently vandalized that it&#039;s become completely useless. Most of the links that seem promising are scams, the few links that do work are either porn or someone&#039;s blog.

				First saw BMR three weeks ago, and saw a listing for a sample of weed for 1 BTC. Figured hey, why not give it a shot? Well, that was three weeks ago, and the vendor still hasn&#039;t shipped it, or even logged on for that matter! Site is so bad that even the vendors can&#039;t be bothered to visit. Finally put the order into dispute today, pretty inconvenient that you can&#039;t just cancel them.<br /><br />All in all, terrible interface, terrible vendors. Save your time and stick to SR!

				If you&#039;re talking about me bill the answer is ok. its really really slow. there is like no traffic on the site. crazy stuff. if you werent talking about me then i apologize for stick my nose in. the one thing i like about BMR though is they have Main Escrow and Shipping Escrow. that way if needed you can have customers release just the shipping escrow while keeping the money for the product in escrow. i think its a neat feture.

				yeah i always use escrow. its kinda thing with me i hate going out of escrow and know other buyers hate it too. so i dont list it if i cant afford to have it in escrow for weeks just in case. the time i ask for an early release of funds is on the shipping for international. but since there is like zero traffic over there i havent even had that happen yet.

				Every now and then they have good sellers on BM, but a lot of them are either inactive or just scammers.&nbsp; Use caution ordering anything from there and never finalize early, especially expensive listings like guns, stolen phones, or gift cards.

				everywhere there are sellers who try to talk customers into releasing the escrow. happens on SR, TA and BMR, all the time. if you haven&#039;t already successfully done business with the seller, you are gonna get screwed (with very few exceptions).<br /><br />BMR just got restarted a little over a month ago or so and is slowly picking up speed. i&#039;ve already done a few good deals there (with both my seller and client account, i use my client account for physical items). when you look at the vendors profile you&#039;ll see his last login date and all past transactions. then you can easily decide if it&#039;s worth your BTC or not. of course there are many new vendors without feedback at the moment, but they also offer cheap or free samples to get a reputation. not much risk trying it.<br /><br />may the escrow be with you at all times!<br />lolzer

				I love how people bash something they haven&#039;t tried. They create an account. Log in and see that it isn&#039;t a copy of silk road. Then, they complain. It&#039;s not silk road. It&#039;s a much much smaller community. You have to put more faith into the vendors. But, hey that&#039;s what escrow is for. I have many successful purchases over there. I also like how the sellers can leave feedback on buyers. They also tell you in real time how much it will cost in your currency. So you don&#039;t have to break out the calculator. It&#039;s not SR and it doesn&#039;t claim to be. Either way i still use both. I love the SR but i didn&#039;t find out about the SR until after i had used the BM. Maybe that&#039;s why i see it from a different perspective.

				I placed a modest first order last week, but the vendor cancelled with no comment. Didn’t see much that interested me (all things oxy, in 5 and 10 mg doses), and it does seem to be either going away or coming back from something. Paid a hefty b0.30049 fee for a withdrawal of b15 though—that surprised me. I suppose that’s part of their vendor tax arrangement.

				So far so good with BMR, ive had several safe buys and found the sellers most helpful. Seems a bit empty compared to here but is picking up pace slowly and maybe its a good thing. Time will tell, but not to have all your eggs in one basket so to speak has to be a good thing.
