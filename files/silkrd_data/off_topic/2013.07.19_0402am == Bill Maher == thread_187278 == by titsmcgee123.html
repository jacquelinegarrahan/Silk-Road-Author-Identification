				what do you fellas think of good ol&#039; Billy? Personally, I like him, yet at the same time I hate that fuckstick. I particularly enjoy his views of religion; however, I think his whole liberal facade is just that, a facade to get viewers. I don&#039;t understand how he used to be a libertarian, and then, all of a sudden he becomes a hardcore, faggot liberal who trashes republicans, and even libertarians, yet never has anything to say to the &#039;aging hippie liberal douche.&#039; Don&#039;t get me wrong, I watch his show every Friday because it gets into shit you won&#039;t hear any news outlet report, but i think he&#039;s, as Holden Caulfield said best, a phoney.&nbsp;

				If he actually holds the beliefs he professes that&#039;s fine by me. He can make fun of god and Bush and whatever else the hell he wants to. It&#039;s when he acts so goddamn arrogant and as if he is the bees knees authority on all things just because he has an opinion.

				Yeah I really don&#039;t care what his views are. Everyone is entitled to their own ideals. The reason I don&#039;t watch his show is because he&#039;s a pretentious ass and that&#039;s the demographic he is trying to appeal to. I think about half of HBO&#039;s viewership are Maher-worshipping liberal dicksucks who think The Newsroom is a documentary and not historical revisionism.
