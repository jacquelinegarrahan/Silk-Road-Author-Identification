				I want to make a public confession. I &#039;bought from myself&#039; for 3 or 4 of the 26 orders so far racked up on my account. I did it because I don&#039;t have enough money to get marketable stock for my account. Not for nothing, not many people want Bromo-DragonFLY. It&#039;s not the best drug. I mean, it&#039;s good, but too many bad side effects.<br /><br />I have had a lot of difficulties all the way along, but the important thing is that I tried to push forward my bond refund, as I haven&#039;t got the money to invest in new inventory. As it is, I am in debt about $1200 to people and half of that money got eaten by mtgox because my account was under verification and extra-flagged because I inadvertently made a second gox account, forgetting I&#039;d made one previously, and on top of that I was using tor. They allowed me to deposit 7 bitcoins, i traded it back and forth and then tried to withdraw, and they refused it. <br /><br />I got a loan from a friend for bitcoins from a friend to get a batch of DMT made. I had no trouble getting all the chems and glassware, as this is unregulated in the country I am in. The chem supply shops here are over the counter cash down no ID. I ordered a kilo of MHRB through SR, but the vendor failed to deliver and cancelled the order and refunded me. So I haven&#039;t been able to get any new stock, and without any marketable items for sale, I haven&#039;t earned enough honestly to be able to get my bond refund back. <br /><br />My bond refund was not trivial. I paid it in back when bitcoin were worth 14 dollars. The deposit is now worth near $5000, and I had been begging DPR to refund it early but she/he consistently refused and eventually told me that the system was automatic (but hey, I know about web applications and databases and I know that something could have been done). But it would be cheating the rest of the vendors, right? Why should there be an exception for me.<br /><br />So anyway, with the help of a drop shipper who I was fielding orders for (we did not share addresses, I simply passed on the addresses of buyers to them and they posted the orders out), I racked up about 20 sales, but now he&#039;s made bad moves and as far as I know is now in legal trouble. The amounts of the sales that I made both from my own items and the dropshipper&#039;s items amounts to probably $2500 but there is no concession for having made well beyond the $1500 limit, and I was trying as hard as I could but the honest number of sales I made is only 22. So I am far from being eligible to get that money back.<br /><br />I am completely lost for what to do and I technically should have my account suspended. I probably should be banned from here too for this impropriety.<br /><br />I am going to be in arrears on my rent in 4 weeks time, I have a SEPA withdrawal from bitstamp that will appear in my bank account tomorrow of about $120, and I have about $20 in my wallet. I am going to be on the streets soon if I don&#039;t find a solution. I am looking at advertising to offer english language tutoring to people in the local area, and to try and get a formal job working for an english language school here in Sofia. It&#039;s basically all I can do and what&#039;s depressing is that there is no way I am going to be able to make enough money to fulfill my dreams at all (I am a dreamer, always fucking up things so I can&#039;t realise them), in fact I will most likely have to move because I doubt that I will be able to earn the 250eur/month I need to pay my rent, which is on the high side for rental properties here in Sofia.<br /><br />So I&#039;m going to be ok, probably, but my dreams have been shot to hell.

				uh you do realise that by admitting all this here your vendor account will almost inevitably be banned now and your bond seized? i hope for your sake there&#039;s a fair bit of misinformation in all that personal info. if you&#039;re wanted in multiple countries already, an additional drug trafficking charge isn&#039;t going to help matters if/when they do catch up to you.
