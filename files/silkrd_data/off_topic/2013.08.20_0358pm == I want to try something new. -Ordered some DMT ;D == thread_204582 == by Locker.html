				I&#039;m sure there has been many created in the past, but I would like to get some ideas on what drug to try next;<br />I have a reasonable amount of btc&#039;s, enough to buy enough drugs (be it a mix or a single drug) for one/several night(s) (on different occasions&nbsp; ::) ), and would like to try a new drug instead of just e&#039;s and weed. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So far I have tried coke a few times (meh, not really for me), I smoke weed regularly and I do E about 1/2 times a month. Now, I live at home with my mum (18 years old, plan to move out at the earliest opportunity but am still living at home for now :/) and she does not agree with drugs, so most of my trips/rolls are at night when she&#039;s gone to bed. Because of this, I have been too scared to try LSD because I&#039;ve heard that some people stay high for up to 18 hours, so I don&#039;t want to do anything that will last more than 10/12 hours. <br />Apart from this I am open to trying anything, and have the funds to do so.<br />Cheers,<br />Locker.

				Acid rarely lasts more than 12 hours.&nbsp; You should find an opportunity where you&#039;ll have some freedom to do stuff though, with a good friend or two.

				You can pretty much stop an acid trip by using anti-psychotics. Or Valium. That probably won&#039;t work during the peak though. After 8-10 hours it should work well.

				Looks like you should try some acid, last three replies (including mine) mentions it&nbsp; ;D. Don&#039;t be afraid of it, even with a high dose your trip should only last for about 12 hours actually. You will enjoy it, just respect it and don&#039;t take too much too soon. Also for the first few times you should have someone you trust to be your sitter. If you can&#039;t find somewhere else to trip other than at home do small doses (especially when trying to hide it from someone in the same home) like half a tab or only one tab a few times to get a feel for it. Again you should be fine just respect the dosage, and start low if you have any doubts. Being alone with only your mind and thoughts running on acid can be quite the experience if you&#039;ve never done it before.

				Thanks all for your input, but the one thing I&#039;m worried about is my pupils; How long will they stay dilated? Because on E my eyes pretty much fully dilate but go down as soon as I lose my High.<br />Locker.

				Not that im saying LSD is a bad idea, but of all the psychedelics on the road its prob one of the longest lasting effect wise, with a good trip easily hitting the 8-12 hour mark. LSD doesn&#039;t leave much room for error, as with any trip, where you are, what your doing and who you are with play a large part in it, but if an LSD trip goes wrong, your in it for the long haul!<br /><br />I personally recommend something like 2CB for a first trip, its mild and short lasting. DMT is my current favorite, very short lasting but totally amazing. And of course, any Psilocybin mushrooms give a very similar effect to LSD but only last 3-4 hours.<br /><br />Effects on pupils with most psychedelics is minimal. The biggest thing that will give you away tripping is yourself man..lol Taking any trip with a &quot;concern&quot; in your mind is generally not a good idea. DO NOT&nbsp; trip out at home hiding in your room from your mum dude, that may end badly first time...SERIOUSSSSSSS<br /><br />NEVER spike anyone (end of) with LSD man, damm your send them into a bad trip for sure! Don&#039;t fuck around with these kind of drugs man, respect them and they will respect you!<br /><br />You don&#039;t seem like a hard drug user so I would suggest the psychedelic road first myself, but tread it with caution!

				DMT is pretty fucking awesome, LSD is also another amazing drug, but you&#039;d need time an a place to take it :P shrooms can be fun if you haven&#039;t had much experience with psychedelics... if you are really bored you could buy some saliva that shit will get you twisted for a bit, an its legal :P <br /><br />also you said you enjoy E , so MDMA have you ever had MDA? ;)?<br /><br />I&#039;d advise staying away from meth, heroin, bathsalts, and other hardcore drugs..<br /><br /><br />ultimately though, I&#039;d suggest getting your financial situation sorted first. move out of your moms place, and secure a living location and such before blowing your cash on drugs :P<br /><br />you have the rest of your life for that! these are the important years to remain somewhat focused.. however this just my advise, do what you want with it!<br /><br />also random fun fact!!

				2CB is a very mild psychedelic, you feel pretty sober on it mentally. <br />DMT is very intense, its one helllll of a trip, but as stated first time, maybe tread carefully with it. <br />LSD in a low dose might be ok. take half a dose. <br />Ketamine is not my cup of tea, also tread carefully, a K hole is about as much fun as losing it on acid<br /><br />Weed will enhance all of the above drugs, play around with it, see what you think yourself, some like it, some dont... Its safe though, it will just make it more intense, when it does, just stop smoking it...<br /><br />No one can explain a bad trip, its a personal life changing experience, often terrifying, and of course dangerous in the wrong environment.<br /><br />Sounds like your gonna try this at home whatever, personally I say go with 2CB first, snort 5-10mg (it hurts like hell) and see how you get one, dont do more than about 20mg first trip id say. It lasts about 4 hours, its mild, fun and your get a feel for tripping, which nothing can ever really prepare you for man.<br /><br />Or go with K, small amount (don&#039;t now doses myself) which last about 45 mins with little come down, a lot og people love the stuff, its a trip that&#039;s for sure, just not my idea on one hahahahaha<br /><br />

				To add, I also feel that Ketamine would be best for me seeing as I am being on my own. With drugs like E, I find it, although still a good experience, somewhat boring on my own and I feel like I need to share my high with others. Ketamine, especially since, from what other people said, a K hole is a solo experience and quite enjoyable (which If is true, I will be aiming to achieve), so this sounds good to me. I also have around £150, so I feel that, aswell as a decent amount of weed, I am likely to be able to buy some acid for a different night. (There is no chance that I&#039;m mixing drugs that I have never tried individually, especially at home lol)<br />Cheers for your feedback, you&#039;ve all been great.&nbsp; ;D<br />Locker.

Also do a couple keys of the K then wait a few minutes for it to hit, you don&#039;t want to go into a K Hole your first time as it&#039;s a bit frightening and you lose all bodily control if your not use to it.<br /><br />So just do a couple bumps and see what your capable of then maybe increase dosage as well as mixing it with other drugs. But just take it one step at a time, then you will understand what the drug and you are both capable of. Finally 210ug is a very good first dose of acid, when I first did acid about a year ago I got 200ug and it blew my mind so enjoy, be safe and try and stay relaxed......Hope all goes well and we&#039;ve all been helpful!<br /><br />Regards<br />PlanB :)

				Please remember, that this whole experience is going to be over several weeks, and I am buying (what i believe to be) a fair amount of each drug, so I will have time to experiment with each drug on it&#039;s own. Also, the order still has not been completely decided but I feel that these drugs would be best for me by myself, but I&#039;m still open to suggestions as it is next sunday that I will be ordering. <br />However I am still not quite sure about the DMT, I have always been the sort of person that has wanted to go straight for the best, and doesn&#039;t really want to have to build up to that. I don&#039;t feel like taking mild psychedelics would be for me, but as I have said I am completely new to the world of psychedelics so do not really know what to expect. With people saying how strong DMT can be, and also the fact that it only last *30 minutes, I&#039;m not quite sure; I may just go for some acid :/<br /><br />You&#039;ve all been great, and I love you all :P<br />Locker.

				I don&#039;t thinks shrooms would be very good idea at the moment, this is mainly/purely because of the pupil dilation; The pupil dilation on shrooms is massive, and I&#039;ve heard that it can last up to a day or two afterwards (noticably), so even f i did do it away from the house i don&#039;t feel I could do shrooms without it becoming obvious.<br />I&#039;m sure I will get the chance when I move out though, but for now I just need something to do while I&#039;m at home.

				Just popping in because my experience seems to be less common but the first psych I tried was DMT: I didn&#039;t get all these warnings and precautions I was just handed it one day by a friend, no idea what it was, and he basically walked me through doing it. (although this isn&#039;t the safety forum I will add the disclaimer that just taking something you have no idea what it is isn&#039;t exactly bright but I trusted this guy)<br /><br />Anyways, it was a great experience and DMT is still probably my favorite psych. Everything else just has a tough body load for me, in my experience. I&#039;ve always been pretty careful with DMT and it&#039;s just a nice, but intense, experience. Just be careful and it&#039;s nothing really to be afraid of. Plus it&#039;s short-acting if you have to be taking things where you could get caught (although I second the idea of taking stuff like this with a friend--give it time and you&#039;ll eventually find someone who shares your exploration interests). <br /><br />And I enjoyed combining Ket and DMT -- probably the most intense experience I&#039;ve ever had. It lasted a rather long time because I packed a large amount of DMT and kept redosing whenever I &quot;came to&quot; enough to hit it again. The Ketamine kept me in a rather sedated, dream-state and the DMT really sent my mind places. <br /><br />If you are interested in deep-thinking you could totally go with 2CB: I had some really strong introspective meditative thoughts and really re-evaluated some stuff in my life at the time. Just thinking about it makes me want to go hit up my buddies and trip with them again. Although, for me, any psychedelic is rather hard for me to play off so I usually hang out with like-minded individuals.<br /><br />And if you just want a light-trip: try a gram or 1.5 grams of mushrooms. It&#039;ll change your thinking a bit and make your vision a little more vibrant but won&#039;t blow you away. <br /><br />Of course everyone reacts differently so be smart, be careful, enjoy.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Glad to be of help :) <br /><br />Yeah 2cb is definitely the one that I got the most introspective experience off of. The LSD I did was alright but just wasn&#039;t strong enough in that department -- mostly just some visual spectacle.<br /><br />&nbsp;I will mention that if you got anything bothering you in your life that it could turn into some painful introspection. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s bad but it can be unpleasant if you aren&#039;t expecting it but I&#039;ve enjoyed my experiences with 2cb and would say it&#039;s a pretty safe bet as far as the 2c-drugs go (dosing isn&#039;t as small as some others and so it&#039;s more forgiving if you&#039;re weighing it out yourself). <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Mescaline is great, but it depends how you take it really, some methods can make you quite sick :(<br /><br />I usually go for the synthetic versions, just because you don&#039;t get the sickness. I find it similar to shrooms, but it can take you to some pretty mental places! <br /><br />If you want good synthetic Mescaline check out:<br />MahaKala http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a558c7d69b

				Low doses of 2CB are pretty mild, 10-40mg, things become colorful, your get waves of euphoria, laughter, giggles etc...

				I think some of you misunderstood;<br />I would not actually be doing it around my mother, or anyone else infact, however I would have a maximum of about 12 hours before I would. So I don&#039;t still want to be noticeably high (ie. dilates pupils and such) when I do. <br /><br />Regarding DMT, I feel that I would be ordering a fairly large amount (due to the strength of the drug, and also the short length of the high) so I would have plenty of time to experiment with smaller doses. I am probably going to order both DMT and 2CB (Definitely not to mix though, not yet ;D), so will have experienced both of them. I don&#039;t feel like I want to do LSD yet, until I have sorted my circumstances out and properly moved out/got enough time away from home. <br /><br />Thanks everyone, <br />Locker.<br /><br />

				DMT is a truly beautiful drug it really is. For me its the best psychedelic I have found in recent years, on another level from anything else I have ever tried, everyone has to try it for sure! I have never had a bad experience with DMT, even on stupidly high doses and even mixed with other drugs, DMT has been my friend throughout!<br /><br />2CB is very mild, its not something I get super excited about though. Its really nice on an MDMA come down thats for sure, it mixes well with other drugs too. I have also tried 2CC and 2CI, which are a bit more potent but very samey. <br /><br />LSD is the first psychedelic I ever took, almost 25 years ago now! My first trip was utterly terrifying, I didn;t really understand what tripping was back then, I took it at a fair ground on my own, It may have been the most scariest 8 hours of my life! I have only had a few bad trips on LSD, but damm, that shit is life changing. My main issue with LSD these days is the length of the trip. Its just to much tripping for this old head these days that&#039;s for sure!<br /><br />I have just landed some 25c-NBOMe / 25i-NBOMe. Thats my next psychedelic venture ;)<br /><br />

				Does music enhance or benefit the ketamine high? Can anybody recommend some music for a ketamine high?

This is also one of the reasons I don&#039;t want to do LSD in a place where I would be unable to do let anyone in other rooms in the house that I was high. If I was to really badly trip, and end up running out of my room or something, It would cause alot of trouble.<br />I&#039;m thinking that I would like to try a fairly high dose of 2c-b, so will have to have a look when i get some btc&#039;.<br /><br />Locker.

				I haven&#039;t read all the pages in this thread, but I saw on the 1st one that you tried Coke and it wasn&#039;t yoiur thing. You gotta understand that if you got typical local street C that most likely is was very light on coke and heavy on cuts like speed, lev, and/or a variety of other caines, you didn&#039;t get the true coke experience. Sampling really good, nearly pure C is a completely different experience . Sukey&#039;s Ultra Clean, Bungees stuff, Studio54&#039;s pure, these are very good and about as pure as you can get. Threre are others , these are just the best I&#039;ve tried personally. It&#039;s a much better experience than doing nasty , speedy cut to shit pseudo coke. You might just change your opinion of C if you sampled the real thing.

Coke is always so expensive aswell, but then I suppose you need alot less than your average street coke to get high (as you can probably go through a gram street coke in a night easily). So i don&#039;t know, It&#039;s certainly an option but it seems quite expensive. :/<br /><br />Anyway, about to try my first lot of Ketamine, wish me luck ;D<br />Locker.

				How did you get on with it, I always found K and music dont mix, sound gets very distorted an odd. Im not a big fan of K anyway, I don&#039;t like the lack of control from any dissociative, for me those drugs might cause hallucinations but there is nothing spiritual in K for me, no connection to anything. Many people swear by the stuff though :)<br /><br />You dont need a massive dose of 2CB, in fact the opposite is advised man, anything over 40mg will get scary, I took 80MG once and had to work to hold my head together, I would never take that kind of dose again myself, it was&nbsp; just wrong, chemical poisoning! 2CB is best around the 20-40mg snorted. I always make 10mg lines, go easy, it comes on fast, your sweat like a moffo and get a bit disoriented. The first hour or so on any 2C is toxic, it does ease off and become quite pleasant though eventually. 2C for me has nothing on what I consider true psychedelic compounds (LSD, psilocybin, DMT, Mescaline)!<br /><br />I love my coke, its been a massive issue in my life. I have lost so much from it. There is NO good coke on the road man. I have tried 8+ vendors all offering uncut / 90%+ cocaine. Utter bollocks! Most I have been cut with legal highs, or are utter shit. Im naughty and wash my coke cold with ammonia, I know my stuff, what they sell on here is not decent coke. I have a local source for that. Its cheaper than on here, and comes in at about 80%, which is good coke! Dont buy it on here! <br /><br />

I have to say i was not expecting something like what happened, and it came so quickly and almost scared me a little coming up. I knew i should have made sure that I only had on the case the amount I was snorting and shouldn&#039;t have left all 500mg in front of me; I remember snorting the initial 150mg line, It was completely harsh and I felt like I was going to be stuck with a horrible drip for the rest of the high, but after about 2 minutes that left so I decided to bump a further 50mg line as it was coming up, but unaware to me during the high I had completely cleaned off the ketamine from the case, meaning that I had snorted a total of 500mg within the first 5-10 minutes (As it only took 5 minutes to come up).This started to scare me a little bit, but I quickly lost all of my thoughts being thrown into the void. This I think was the turning factor for the high.<br /><br />I had my headphones plugged into the TV, and I found the music to fit perfectly with the drug and I believe it completely changed the start of the high, and it almost felt like the music was my life, and I couldn&#039;t do anything without it, and it almost controlled me in a way but this is hard to explain, this is when i started to completely space out and go into a different reality (I was listening to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWpSbTdNMjk). My whole reality was warping with the music, my movements were somewhat robotic and I had little to no control over myself at all, I was forced to just go with the high and let it do whatever it wanted.<br /><br />Then, as my whole body &#039;jolted&#039; left and right for whatever reason (very vague memory&#039;s at this point), and my headphones actually got pulled out and the music started playing out of the TV. At this point it snapped me out of the small &#039;trance&#039; I was in and I went and unplugged the tv; It must have took me about 30 seconds, I felt as if I had just jumped up 100m into the air and I was slowly falling, grabbing the plug out and then falling back into the bottomless pit that my consiousness was getting pulled down through my pillow.<br /><br />I was expecting my body to become completely numb and I would be sitting still for the high, but it was completely the opposite; it was like my body became my mind and consciousness and my mind became my body, they both moved in complete unity and pretty much became one. I was cycling through different places and states it seemed to me that I was living about 5 different reality&#039;s and consciousness&#039; at once, all seemed to be a variation of another and slightly different. For example, at one point It seemed almost impossible to even swallow, when i tried my whole reality just shook and I was unaware of what was happening, so I gained enough control to grab for the bottle of water that was next to me (thank you for telling me to bring one, It helped alot). It was like the bottle both existed and didn&#039;t exist, it was there but it also wasn&#039;t, i was living out different reality&#039;s at once and honestly I didn&#039;t know which one was real, but the bottle almost felt sacred, it felt like when I took the lid off of it (and also didn&#039;t) a huge amount of energy was released. It must have taken me about 5 minutes from grabbing the bottle to me drinking it, and then I simply just dropped it on the floor and want into a different reality.<br /><br />At this point I almost started to get scared, I tried to convince myself that it was simply just a drug but It felt like I had ruined everything, I had done this and I would be like it for eternity forever changing reality and I honestly didn&#039;t know what was real anymore, i didn&#039;t know where I was or if I was even alive. This is what I though it was like to be dead, i could live exactly how I wanted to and live as many imaginary lives as I wanted. But then It came to my mind that I am In my bedroom and that there was something happening to me. Although some people had said it, I had not thought it was actually true. At that point I was voilently sick over the side of my bed onto my bedroom floor, several times. I am not sure if this is the reason but I was told that weed, even if smoked the previous day can make you sick on ketamine. I had not smoked weed during the high because I didn&#039;t want to change the high at all, but I had that morning and If what people have said is true that could have been what has made me sick. It came out of no where, I didn&#039;t understand what was happening to me but I simply accepted it as I had no control over myself still at that point and continued to ride in and out of hyperspace.<br /><br />The whole peak of the high where I had no control over myself must have lasted just over 2 hours and 15 minutes, as I looked at the clock just after I came back into the living world. I was shocked by this, as I had thought that it only lasts about an hour but I think this must be due to the amount I unintentionally took. When I turned my tv back on I was only listening to my music for about 11 minutes since I snorted my first line, which amazed me because from the start to unplugging the music felt like about an hour and the whole experience felt like an eternity. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t know what to think about the high at the moment, but my head is still spinning and I almost feel wrong, and that things aren&#039;t right currently.<br />I don&#039;t know, but that was one hell of a trip, but I&#039;m now off to clean up my sick ;D.<br /><br />Thanks for your advice, but nothing could have prepared me for that lol,<br />Locker.<br />

				So your a puker huh, common with K, especially with Alcohol. See people spewing all night on it, gross really lol<br /><br />Learn from that man! K Holes are not my cup of tea either, many take it once and never do again! I did warn you lol K either does very little or to much, I have never found a middle ground. I chose to avoid it, all my mates do it all the time. I say no to it very easily!!<br /><br />There is nothing else like the K buzz though, other than PCP and synthetic versions. <br /><br />LSD, Shrooms and Mescaline are all quite similar in effect. 2C family drugs are close, but can be milder (2CB / 2CI, others ARE NOT!!)<br /><br />Again you can end up in a very similar situation to a K hole, but worse on any of these drugs. Freaking out on a trip can last 8-12 hours (compared to a 45 minutes - 2 hours in a K hole), you can move around on it (very dangerous) and the truth is some people never come round (its rare but I know 2 friends now fucked from LSD)... Its prob won&#039;t happen to you and im not trying to scare monger.<br /><br />Just be mindful man, don&#039;t do them alone and your enjoy them more if you take with friends to share the experience. K its not so important as you cant talk to anyone while on it anyway lol<br /><br />Stay safe my friend! A good trip will leave you in a good place, you won&#039;t be questioning it, your learn something deep and meaningful about yourself that&#039;s for sure. NEVER had that from K myself, tried it a good few times, always left thinking... Jesus christ why did I do that, that was horrible...<br /><br />NO FUN IN K FOR ME MAN<br /><br />NOTHING will prepare you for tripping either lol Much like K, once you in it your in it, and its a much longer ride thats for sure<br /><br />

				If your still&nbsp; curious man and that&#039;s not left you too shaken (takes me bloody days to get over a K hole) I would still recommend 2CB man.<br /><br />Its cheap, your get a 20MG dose for a fiver on here, I have trusted vendors UK to UK if you need man. Just do a 10MG line first and wait for 30 mins.. It wont kick in instantly man, no drug will!!<br /><br />Its very mild man, your get a bit edgy first 30 mins, might sweat a bit too, its a new experience that&#039;s normal. Things get colorful, you feel a bit relaxed, its not full on tripping on a low dose, things will bend and twist a little, but its all very manageable. Best thing is mentally, on low doses your very &quot;with it&quot;, almost sober...<br /><br />Really you want to be with people on 2CB, I dont see the point in a solo venture. Its one you can take outside easy enough. Get out into the country man, best place to be tripping imo

				Thank you, I think 2c-b is going to be my next venture into psychedelics and new drugs.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the reason it turned so quickly is because of the stupid amount that I did, as everyone was recommending 200-300mg and I went and took 500mg. I can remember extremely vividly, over about 30 seconds I went back and forth and done every single line that I had split up (Unable to control myself). <br /><br />I still don&#039;t know what to think of the high, at the moment I feel very dizzy and strange, almost that I do not belong here but I think that&#039;s just the shock from the high haha. ;D<br /><br />I had not had any alcohol, but did smoke weed the morning before and I&#039;ve heard that that can cause sickness, or it may have been the disgusting drip that I remember in the first few minutes before&nbsp; I fell into the oblivion. <br /><br />Also, when you say that no drug will kick in instantly, maybe not quite instantly but within about a minute I was feeling it, and by 5-10 minutes I was at peak. Even though it was vivid I know this because as i said, the first 11 minutes felt like an hour as the music was basically controlling me, and then I unplugged it. <br /><br />I have to say though, there were points that were quite enjoyable but it was just the fact that I was unable to control myself that I maybe didn&#039;t enjoy,<br />Locker.

				I&#039;ve never had a bad time on 2cb - it&#039;s just so easy going. Perfect for a first time psychedelic experience. the phens and tryptamines are totally different to k and other dissociative though. I find there&#039;s no fear in K you simply merge with the universe which turns out to be your couch... <br /><br />I will say that if you want to experience the K hole again you make sure you keep your usage of K minimal because if you use it casually/recreationally and for a K hole then your tolerance will sky rocket. And that&#039;s just with maybe 1+g a week.<br /><br />Also if you snort 2cb it&#039;s very painful and personally i wouldn&#039;t snort it. As long as you don&#039;t go over 30mg oral(that&#039;s still a high dose for a first time 20-25mg would be ideal) you should have a great time on 2cb. The K experience should at least give you a glimpse of what your mind can get up to which should mean that you can (hopefully) control your trip a little better.<br /><br />I also find magic mushrooms more intense than LSD. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s down to dosing though. Out somewhere in nature is the perfect place to do psychedelics. The beach on a quiet day watching the sunset is just magical when your tripping.<br /><br />Gain some understanding of these chems then when you feel ready, DMT is the king of all psychedelics. Only 2 drugs have got me into my version of heaven - K and DMT. The K also fucked me up for a while so be aware that it can be psychologically addictive whereas the phens and tryptamines require a lot of effort to abuse because they can be mentally taxing. It&#039;s almost as if they are self regulating...

I had not smoked weed during the high because I didn&#039;t want to change the high at all, but I had that morning and If what people have said is true that could have been what has made me sick. It came out of no where, I didn&#039;t understand what was happening to me but I simply accepted it as I had no control over myself still at that point and continued to ride in and out of hyperspace.<br /><br />The whole peak of the high where I had no control over myself must have lasted just over 2 hours and 15 minutes, as I looked at the clock just after I came back into the living world. I was shocked by this, as I had thought that it only lasts about an hour but I think this must be due to the amount I unintentionally took. When I turned my tv back on I was only listening to my music for about 11 minutes since I snorted my first line, which amazed me because from the start to unplugging the music felt like about an hour and the whole experience felt like an eternity. <br /><br />I still don&#039;t know what to think about the high at the moment, but my head is still spinning and I almost feel wrong, and that things aren&#039;t right currently.<br />I don&#039;t know, but that was one hell of a trip, but I&#039;m now off to clean up my sick ;D.<br /><br />Thanks for your advice, but nothing could have prepared me for that lol,<br />Locker.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I don&#039;t like tripping personally, but Looker your writing is so fantastic it really makes me feel like I was right there with you the whole time.&nbsp; You really do have quite a talent!&nbsp; So refreshing to see through the eyes of a young person so interested in &quot;experiencing&quot; all aspects of &quot;life&quot;.&nbsp; You really made my day just wanted to thank you for that!

				Ok, there&#039;s been a slight change. ;D I have been trying to persuade my friend to try something other than weed (suggested a psychedelic or a drug somewhat more intense than weed), and his blunt no was justified by the fact that he did not want to take any random, unknown chemicals like lsd or 2cb, that could go completely wrong and make you go crazy,&nbsp; (As he had a friend that had several seizures after taking &#039;LSD&#039; [which I believe was just a bad acid substitute]), which I found rather ironic considering he takes street coke that did almost nothing for me... lol. After he said this I went on to recommend shrooms, and continued to explain that they just give you a buzz and make you feel good, and are just like eating mushrooms. He seemed to be somewhat intrigued, and after several days of giving him the &#039;they&#039;re grown out of the ground and are completely natural&#039; speech he came round and decided he would give them a go. So it looks like I&#039;m doing some shrooms ;D;<br /><br />Now I have no knowledge or clue about the dosage, high or shrooms in general. So I just have a few questions;<br />Can anyone recommend a good (prefferably UK domestic) Vendor for shrooms? I don&#039;t know about the types of shrooms, which should I buy?<br />I want to have a decent high, but not one that will last too long and come as a shock, how should I go about the dosage? And speaking about the length, how long on average will a medium high last for, and how long will pupil dilation last? (As i&#039;ve seen shroom eyes are massive, and although I won&#039;t be at home when taking I will have to go home the same day [consume in the morning, go back in the evening] so will my eyes be dilated?<br /><br />Thank you all in advance, <br />Locker.

				I can&#039;t recommend vendors as I&#039;ve never purchased shrooms from here but as for everything else it depends. The most common shrooms that everyone does are psilocybe cubensis. Cubensis mushrooms. Cyanescens are suppose to be more potent by the gram but there&#039;s only one listing, I can only comment on Cubensis anyways as that&#039;s all I&#039;ve ever done. <br /><br />As far as dosage I&#039;d recommend nothing less than 3.5 grams per person especially since it won&#039;t be a solo trip, anything less will be pretty on the low-medium side as far as strength goes. 3.5 and higher for a medium-strong trip. Everyone is different but 3.5 for me was pretty nice, it felt amazing it&#039;s been a while but it was pretty amazing and quite psychedelic. You can eat them but I&#039;d prefer tea or lemon tek. Tea is probably the way to get the most out of them in my opinion though. <br /><br />They kick in about 30 minutes to an hour after you ingest and should last at least 8-9 hours. Can&#039;t comment on the length of pupil dilation though I never really pay attention to mine but they do get dilated that&#039;s for sure lol.

UKShrooms sells 7g capsules which I assume would be enough for both of us and save us having to eat/drink mushrooms (Which I hate the taste of).<br />And man, shrooms are expensive, was never expecting a trip to cost that much&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />But I don&#039;t mind, I&#039;m willing to invest into my first psychedelic, and with a friend lol ;D<br />Locker.

				Capsules are just like eating them basically, I can&#039;t really say for sure what you should expect as everyone has different reactions to mushrooms. Lot&#039;s of people eat shrooms and enjoy them, but for me it ruins the trip. My stomach just isn&#039;t meant for eating them. Now I&#039;ve never actually ground shrooms up into dust and maybe dust/powder would be easier on the stomach for consumption but as far as shroom chunks and just eating them whole I find that I feel quite bloated and for most of the trip I&#039;m dealing with a very upset stomach.<br /><br />As far as the taste if you decide to take the capsules apart and consume them in a different way I find that mixing the shrooms with green tea or some other tea, adding sugar and or honey can take away from the bad taste and make it easier to down the drink. I&#039;d highly recommend this method as I said everyone is different but from my experience I&#039;d think you guys will enjoy the shrooms much more when consumed as tea.<br /><br />The lemon tek is quite good for taste too. lemon tek is simple just squeeze juice from a real lemon into a cup, chop shrooms up nicely and let them sit 20-30 minutes, drain shroom juice into another cup (optional) and down shot. It&#039;s really almost no shroom taste at all. To me it feels quite different than tea or eating, I don&#039;t really know how to explain it as I&#039;ve only done it a few times but it&#039;s worth trying out if you have extra shrooms to play around with.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really offer any advice on any high dosages though as the highest I&#039;ve ever consumed at one time is 1/8th. If you plan on purchasing the 7g capsules and plan on taking one each maybe someone else can chime in on what you can be expecting but I know what ever happens if you eat them you&#039;ll probably be tripping too hard to be worried about anything else so everything I just said may be irrelevant&nbsp; ;D

The shrooms caps are of course grinded, so maybe that would help. I would likely be consuming it in the morning on an empty stomach, so I feel that there&#039;s nothing else I can do as I can not really comment on the nausea until I experience it. :)) <br /><br />If I ever buy full shrooms in the future instead of capsules I will likely make shroom tea, but Shrooms are expensive damn :)) lol.<br />Cheers, <br />Locker.

				Seeing as I got screwed over with the 2cb vendor and had to be refunded, I&#039;ve ordered some DMT ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to try it for a while and now took the step and done it.<br />Wish me luck ;D<br /><br />Going to be doing as much research as I can until it arrives, so I should be ready (even though it&#039;s actually my first psychedelic ???), <br />Locker.
