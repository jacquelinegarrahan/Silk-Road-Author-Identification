				I&#039;m interested in some research chemicals (beyond what is offered on SR).<br /><br />Can anyone recommend any sites that are legit, ie. ship a product and one that is of quality?<br /><br />I&#039;d prefer to find lab certified sources too.<br /><br />Thanks for any info.

				http://buy-jwh.com/<br /><br />They send stuff and it&#039;s cheapest I could find. Can&#039;t comment the quality, I&#039;m not experienced with RC&#039;s. Stuff I tried does the job as it is supposed to:)

I&#039;m also interested in smallish quantities of synthetic cannabinoids to experiment with blend making (maybe not the most efficient but a pellet of hash mixed with cannabinoids has worked great for me). Psilacetin (4-AcO-DMT) looks nice too... ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m really just looking for legit vendors, preferably with lab certified documents of purity. I understand that can be difficult though as it&#039;s mostly made in China and everyone is pretty much a middle man. I&#039;m looking for a one stop shop with the best prices. Buy-JWH looks like they&#039;re the best so far.

				In my experience, searching for the chemical you want plus something like &quot;research&quot; or similar terms will give you a good number of sources. Just be sure to check it with safeorscam.

				astro-lab.com used to be good but they&#039;ve pulled all their stock. Shame as I wanted some 2C-C from them.<br />I&#039;ve heard mixed reviews about these people http://buybestrc.com&nbsp; but I&#039;m too poor to risk getting scammed at the moment! <br />Hoping that someone on SR can offer up some good RCs for delivery to UK!

				https://www.euphoricknowledge.com<br /><br />Using the same common sense here, use vendors with high feedback and many reviews in their threads. Usually MUCH cheaper than going through a stand-alone website. Once you register, visit the &quot;market&quot; category. I have personally used this site several times with a couple different vendors.

There aren&#039;t too many reasonably priced bulk RC vendors on SR yet, though I&#039;d love to see some. I figure they may want to avoid the fee SR charges, but hey, they could at least promote themselves on OVDB where there is no fee. The fact that the RC scene is so spread out and convoluted sucks for the average buyer because there are 10,000 sites that say they sell RCs and like 100 that do.

				+1 on the euphoric knowledge<br /><br />prices for RC&#039;s there are 1/10th of what they are on SR<br /><br />and most trusted vendors take direct moneypak (if you&#039;re cool with that)<br /><br />bought from them on 6 occasions and never been ripped or shorted
