				Most people&#039;s stories will likely be similar (i sawed it on teh interbutts), but meh.<br /><br />As for me, half a year ago I was just wasting my life on the internet one day, and I saw a jpg that described the &quot;levels of the internet&quot; as the water below an iceberg. One of the levels said &quot;TOR required beyond this point&quot;, so I duckduckgoed TOR, and 30 minutes later I had an SR account.<br /><br />Although my way of using it so far is a kind of &quot;postal drug tourism&quot;--that is, going to hang out in countries where what I want to try can be shipped domestically and/or the penalties are not as life-shattering as where I live and having shit shipped to my hotel, if I end up liking drugs as much as I think I do so far I might just have to pack up the last decade of my life and relocate out of boredom (well, if I can get a visa somewhere).

				I read it on a thread of a forum that was completely hyping up the deep web. The OP made it seem like it was the answer to all of your needs in the underground. Nope, most sites actually suck. Only a few useful places, like SR.

				Actually ran across a friend I hadn&#039;t seen in a while.&nbsp; He told me about Tor, and how, &quot;You can buy drugs from Tor&quot; -- I went home did a little investigating, I chuckled.&nbsp; I guess you &quot;technically&quot; can buy drugs from USING Tor, but yea.. LOL

				I was looking for a crossbow or stabby item (I was on Karate-Mart) and then it somehow got upgraded to guns and I thought, I&#039;ll just have a quick look at that too, and then I somehow ended up on that page about The Armoury and there was a link to download something called Tor Bundle and I thought what the hell is that, is it a trick? There&#039;s no place on the internet that sells guns, and it said no sir, it&#039;s the underweb and I said what the hell is that, and it said just look at the iceberg picture, and I said OH MY GOD! THAT WAS TOTALLY MY IDEA!!! (They stole my idea.) And I thought... no.... no, it can&#039;t be right, just to prove them un-right I am going to download Tor and go to this Armoury. Well it wasn&#039;t a trick and he wasn&#039;t a snitch, it actually worked but The Armoury didn&#039;t. It had closed down. Come to think of it I think I got this information from two different web sights. Oh shit! I thought you asked me how did you discover Tor, not how did you discover SR? Oh sorry! <br /><br />I don&#039;t actually remember how I discovered Silk Road. I wish I remembered. If I remember, I will get back to you mkay. I am so tired I am running on fumes now. I&#039;m also hungry. (Long day.) My God I&#039;m drivelling. I&#039;ll be back tomorrow or the next maybe. I&#039;m what I call &quot;bong-on tired&quot;. cya. Piece out. ;)&nbsp;

				We&#039;d been hosting these &quot;skeptic&quot; parties for some time, finding that converts fell harder than the curious or credulous, and having publicly proclaimed their belief, could be counted on to suppress all self doubt. It started with palm readings and tarot - our man Edward would feign shock at our otherworldly peception, leading others, now excitable and hopeful despite themselves, to drop sufficient clues to justify the rather exhorbitant table fee. Then came the channeling, oh! The channeling. Melinda would moan and cast about. She was utterly convincing. On audition I&#039;d nearly called for medical aid. It was all going too well, of course, and as pride comes before the fall, we had published in the paper of record An Invitation: to any who would join us this All Hallows Eve, in the Year of Our Lord 2012, to name the manner of divination along with the knowledge desired and We. Would. Provide. What a giddy bunch we were. Behind nervous smiles, however, festered a growing unease. What would be asked of us? Claude had nearly completed his &quot;spirit floor&quot; - by which ingenious mechanism our grand teak buffet would rise below trembling hands for the traditional but always-pleasing seance. Grandmere Tautou was utterly convincing in all things that drip and discolour - tea, wine, even entrails. Lucius still had no luck with that goat, but what were the odds of that particular selection?<br /><br />The morning was met with brave faces and private trepidation. There would be many requests, of course. Perhaps we could simply avoid any procedure for which we were unprepared. The public would demand we tackle the grandest of requests, but as any performer knows, the most difficult misdirection can (and should!) seem unimpressive. Drama, contrarywise, is cheap.<br /><br />The only event for which we were truly unprepared was the event which befell us: no requests came. Had we set the price too high? (Did I mention? It put our usual wage to shame, but a one-of-a-kind event calls for a one-of-a-kind price.) Had they nothing left, the citizenry&#039;s collective imagination sated and sapped of wonder? Finally on the eve of the third night, (by which point we sat in turns disconsolate and relieved) a knock came upon the door. We regarded the courier solemnly and accepted his charge. A shared grimace and then to it - and lo! Claude had to tear the letter from Melinda&#039;s grasp, so overcome with laughter she was that she could not communicate its contents. Claude read aloud the missive, incredulous. This was truly the first miracle witnessed in this drab corner of Empire. It was a snap. In pocket. A trick so base we had not thought to perform it. No real preparation was needed. We would entertain the following night.<br /><br />I conclude this now in haste before the constabulary arrives. No time to pack; our enterprise is in shambles, the crowd, a maddened mob. The gentleman client, a Mr. Duke, had but one hand upon the planchette next to our four. How could the reading go so awry? We bid the &quot;spirits&quot; answer the man&#039;s inquiry upon the Ouija, but no sense of reply could be made. Only the same characters, again and again, &quot;s...i...l...k...r...o...a...d...v...b...5...p...i...z...&quot; and so forth. Rubbish! Claude is convinced there is some meaning, and intends to enter the cipher at next opportunity upon this &quot;internet&quot; but if there rests our hope then I truly believe we are done for. <br /><br />Oh gods, they&#039;ve called the dogs. I must away.

				Reddit, believe it or not.&nbsp; There was an askreddit thread about the deep web.&nbsp; Somebody linked a guide on the tor network which had a link to the hidden wiki.&nbsp; Found silk road through that and basically figured everything else out on my own.<br /><br />Ironically, I know get mad whenever I see a post on reddit mentioning SR.&nbsp; Some thought goes through my head like &quot;stfu, we can&#039;t let all these idiots know about SR&quot; when I am, in fact, one of those idiots.

				Great thread Idea,<br /><br />i knew TOR many years ago as i mean to change my IP but had no idea about the &quot;hidden services option&quot;, as im working in the technology i was pretty amazed to hear about that in the mainstream media last year - and when they said i could buy drugs trough there all i needed is a few minutes search to find the Silk Road :)

				I moved away from the place I grew up. I had no connects, so I started looking for MOM services(something I was already familiar with, but the service I had discovered a while back had gone by the wayside.) It led me to a few different topix forums, one of which had posts from some Irish dude who was apparently accepting non-bitcoin payments from people on the forum, buying stuff on SR for them and entering their address in the window. So I started looking into SR, and ended up following all y&#039;all happy travelers. ;D

				I don´t know if you ever heard of couch-surfing, Its like an online community that you use if you want to travel. to exchange places to stay and travel info and that. <br />Well one time I had these two stoners from the US staying at mine and they asked me to link them up some drugs, conversation got flowing and they told me about this &quot;ebay of drugs&quot; I was like nahhh you gotto be kidding, 20 mins later they installed tor on my PC and I was trying to figure out the fastest way to get bitcoins into my account :P Thanks sugarmomma
