				Haven&#039;t been there but will definitely go. I&#039;ve been planning to live there a year for quite a while now. Being white/black in Japan is like being a superstar. Should be easy to slay some poon there.

				Lived there.&nbsp; Let me know if you got any questions.&nbsp; And to the dude who said it is dangerous due to radiation... sorry, not true.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t visit a damaged reactor, but the WHOLE country isn&#039;t dangerous.&nbsp; You want an entire country to just up and leave?&nbsp; These people had a couple atom bombs dropped on them and then turned their country into a world power.&nbsp; They will be fine.

				Are Japan, only way i could find my way around Nichome was the radiation and the truly original and still the best meth ever [had a bit more serotonin and dopamine kicking 20 years ago], got friends they wont leave and there close to X, they stood on a headland at there house in Chiba and watched the ocean suk out to see. The big fear now is not the radiation but the oncoming tsunami of asbestos related disease and it will be massive but then so is the current and ongoing mentall illness crisis. Hey those Japanese are adapters and tough fuckers. Japan will survive while there is still one bowl of Gohan to be had.<br /><br />Was wondering about SR in Japan. Not the most drug friendly town but then you would have to be&nbsp; seriously braindead to get done. Have heard its pretty wired with party stuff for both Nihonjin and Gaijin<br /><br />Good Luk, dont eat fish or anything from China

				I don&#039;t want to say how long I&#039;ve been here as it feels like identifying info, but it&#039;s most of my adult life a huge chunk of anyone&#039;s life. Realizing the subcultures of the west I&#039;ve missed out on I now suddenly want the fuck out, but how do you leave the only place you know?<br /><br />But anyway thought I&#039;d just see if there were any fellow expats here.

				My wife and I lived in Japan for 3 years. We loved every minute of it, from the food, outdoor activities, to the people. <br />America cannot claim to have rebuilt Japan, but they played a big part. Mostly in the selling of cheap home building materials, you will see most of the homes in the country side built with concrete. America is still involved in the government but now everything is mostly military related. Japan is not allowed to have offensive military capabilities so the U.S. has taken up those responsibilities.<br />I don&#039;t know anything about the re-writing of textbooks concerning the Fukashima nuclear power plant disaster but nothing would surprise me. The Japanese government recently re-wrote textbooks concerning the atrocities committed on Okinawa citizens during world war 2. Resulting in mass protest on the islands down there.

				Japan is a fucking cool, albeit extremely different place to go/live.&nbsp; I have friends who I have visited twice there - Tokyo and Hiroshima - and I loved it.&nbsp; Culture shock?&nbsp; Kinda.&nbsp; But once you get over yourself and realize how crass the massive commercial culture is wherever you are, and hang out with folk who live there, then you get a real sense of the place.<br /><br />Get lost on the Tokyo train system for a few hours, even a day, that&#039;s an experience, especially when you really don&#039;t have a clue how to communicate properly, and are hoping you know the number of the platform you&#039;re looking for, and how to say it correctly if there&#039;s no sign about.&nbsp; I spent 3 months learning Hiragana before I went, only to discover that&#039;s like learning about a third of our alphabet and knowing how to make vowel sounds.&nbsp; Then you get hit with Katakana and Kanji and realise you are fucked, and ask politely if the person speaks English.&nbsp; My friends have lived there for years and are fluent verbally, but struggle to read the newspaper.<br /><br />I love seafood and if you do to you will be spoiled for choice - had dudes in bars and restaurants trying to make me puke with various types of raw and bizarre-looking fish, but they were great.&nbsp; Proper sushi and sashimi, fucking delicious.&nbsp; But you can get decent pasta and pizza outlets, and burger joints all over the place if you ain&#039;t so adventurous.&nbsp; But they have this &#039;delicacy&#039; - can&#039;t remember what it was called - but it tasted like bins smell - wasn&#039;t a big fan of that.<br />
