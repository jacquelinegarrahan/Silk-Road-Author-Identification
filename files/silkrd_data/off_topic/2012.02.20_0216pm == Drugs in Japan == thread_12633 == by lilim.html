				Having just watched Enter the Void, it had me thinking about the availability of drugs and the scenes they&#039;re associated with in Japan. I also have a friend (fluent in the language) planning to live in Tokyo mid-year (it&#039;s definite). I&#039;ve asked him about it, but he&#039;s said it&#039;s going to suck, in that respect. I think he has just said that to prevent further conversation - he wants to avoid temptation and the risks associated with getting busted there. <br /><br />Has anyone lived/travelled to Japan and found them scarce? Like the film, do foreigners get their drugs from other foreigners or will locals open their wares to ex-pats? If you speak Japanese well does this make it any different (I know socially, it does. The Japanese aren&#039;t racist, they just prefer to not struggle communicating)? Would you only find local dealers in gang territory (that seems like too much trouble to put yourself in)?<br /><br />Have any vendors sent to Japan and are there any vendors situated there? What is the success rate?<br /><br />Also, I understand that drugs are a heavy taboo in Japan. Sorry I have a lot of questions, but I&#039;m just very curious. What has SR to say?

				I used to work in a japanese restaurant, and I talked to the sushi chef who was born and raised in japan.&nbsp; He didnt tell me about the availability of drugs, but that the punishments were quite severe, much more so than USA, even for miniscule amounts of marijuana.

				There are drugs everywhere my friend. Even those &quot;conservative&quot; societies, when it comes to getting high, it&#039;s all pretense. I have a friend who lived in Saudi Arabia and he&#039;d get backed all the time. In fact he went there a few months ago and he couldn&#039;t stop talking about the hash he got there. Quite a few of my smoking buddies are from the ME and most started smoking while in their respective countries. People obviously won&#039;t be very open about such things so it&#039;s hard to find a hook up. Best bet is to be friend some 18-25y.o and with some luck you&#039;d be good to go.

				I read about a guy (not from Japan) living there.<br />Japan has a very strict policy on immigration and drugs. So, he was caught with 10 grams of weed and he was told to leave the country.<br />I did read it, so it may not be truth, can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s legit.<br /><br />Found it: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o6q74/i_was_arrested_in_japan_and_spent_3_months_in/<br />It was only 0.65 grams.

				Theres PLENTY of meth in Japan, both crystal and the tablets from SE Asia, Most of the crystal comes from government labs in Nth Korea ! Its popular in the street racing/drifting scene.<br /><br />Not much of anything else though, I swear thats why they have the pure oxygen bars in tokoyo, its the only way to get any sort of buzz on...huffing o2&nbsp; :o

				There is plenty getting around in Japan.<br />I know a few people over there and they are always high.<br />Raids happen all the time in their neighborhood.<br /><br />Japan has one of the best rave scenes ;) ;D<br /><br />Just dont use the governments data on drugs...<br />It doesnt happen. There is no drugs in Japan. The Japanese people DO NOT use drugs.<br /><br />just like homeless people...there is no homeless people in Japan. <br /><br />or fallout in fukushima... there is no nuclear fallout. What fallout??<br /><br />lolz

				i hear shibuya is the place to go, im told that just about any iranian guys there will be able to hook you up as they pretty much run a lot of the drugs trade out there (please dont take this as racist, its what i was reliably told by an iranian friend who has relatives living there) however i also hear that once you have made your purchase you should get the hell out fast as you can. it used to be shinjuku that was the slightly dodgier area but it seems to have moved in recent years. also i suppose it depends on your chosen substance, im not sure if they still do but at one point japanese headshops used to sell mushrooms and up until 1997 2CB was sold as a sexual aid for men in pharmacies under the name Performax if memory serves correctly. another thing i know about japan is that by far the most prevalent drugs are amphetamines, and its by quite a large margin (a statistic i saw said that in that year 80% of all drug arrests were for amphetamines)<br /><br />that said you have to be aware that over there more so than most places drugs are frowned upon by the general populous, especially when its some gaijin (foreigner) doing it, so dont go trying to sneak a quick spliff in a quiet corner of the park or something, someone will notice and very likely dob you in (chances are the japanese drugs scene is lager than you would know as many users will keep quiet about what they do) remember over 50% of people in japan are approaching pension age and the older generations are still very much stuck in their way, again im not being racist in any way here, up until the late 1800s japan was a &quot;closed&quot; country, the only foreigners allowed in were certain dutch traders as they had a trade embargo of sorts with the dutch, so a little over 100 years or a mere 2 generations ago many people had never even seen a person from another country hence they tend to be a lot less trusting of us gaijin, its changing now slowly as they are exposed to the rest of the world but its still very much there. <br /><br />this change can even be evidenced in recent times, look at japanese media, the stuff from the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s was usually packed with gore and sex, ultra violent images were youre typical saturday morning watching, while we watched thundercats they were watching fist of the north star. fast forward to today and comics, anime and movies are getting the violence censored out and the sex toned down by a large degree, the only reason for this is that since the dawn of the internet the eyes of the world have been on japan as much as the rest of the world and our western moral code has started to penetrate through. so give it another 50 years and the japanese may be as open about drugs and their drug use as we westerners are but for now its still something thats considered by the masses to be something done only by the &quot;rejects of society&quot; etc<br /><br />sorry im rambling on again arent i? i get like that when im bored and have no weed :P

				So little I can say about this subject without blowing my anonymity...<br /><br />I love Japan, it&#039;s in my blood, I can&#039;t help it.<br />Cannabis grows wild in Hokkaido and other northern areas.<br />Actually, it is an ancient part of certain Shinto practices. I say &#039;certain&#039; because there is always another family in Japan who disagrees with you. If I say A, they say B.. But there was an ancient Japanese dai ma scene, as it were. ( dai ma - great hemp). Its just really really not talked about.

				Thanks for the interesting discussion people! I&#039;m quite surprised to learn about the Dai Ma scene and canabis growing in the wilds of Hokkaido. <br /><br />Recently, I discovered that mescaline is not outlawed within Japan and that you can purchase peyote cacti!!!<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for an awesome, typically-deranged, trippy J-horror film, try finding House (aka Hausu).<br /><br />Trailer - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN0HVJ5tkIM

				You would need a vendor who is very familiar with Japanese language and culture (underworld culture especially). and who is able to produce mail that is normal to Japanese regular mail. Also, I do not doubt 任侠団体 connections would help. They like to keep the Japanese drug trade tidily in their sight from what I know

				Personally I&#039;ve been to Tokyo and well.. when I walk round the streets of where I live in the UK I can tell pretty much who the drug takers are.. in Tokyo I couldn&#039;t do that. Not to say they aren&#039;t there, I&#039;m sure there are.. but yeah<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of going back and getting stuff sent to my hotel. Although I don&#039;t know if the japanese police will buy the whole &quot;drugs? what drugs? what are you talking about&quot;. I might just end up with an asshole full of yakuza dick. On the up side though it probably wouldn&#039;t hurt too much.

				Japan isn&#039;t a great place for druggies.&nbsp; As a foreigner you might be cut some slack, but the penalties generally are unforgiving and even harsh.&nbsp; As somebody else mentioned here, the conviction rate is very high for most crimes including drug &quot;crimes.&quot;&nbsp; Drugs are hard to find, especially given that Japan traditionally has rigid, conservative morals.&nbsp; And as with almost anything else in Japan, drugs will probably be very expensive.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have not researched Japan&#039;s postal system.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall using drugs in Japan seems really risky, and it&#039;s a temptation that&#039;s best avoiding especially if you&#039;re there only for a short period of time.

				It took me 6 months to get into the drug scene in Japan.<br /><br />Thing is, people are REALLY wary of narcs, and have good reason to be. For example, the NCIS (yes, the US NCIS) is active in looking for drug dealers that sell to US soldiers. They frequent clubs in Tokyo, and have an expense account.

				A couple years back I was in Tokyo for 2 weeks on business and I managed to score some weed off some random Japanese guy with strangely colored hair at a beach in Kamakura just outside the city who was recommended to me by a Japanese work colleague.&nbsp; The weed was really good, I think it was probably from Amsterdam, but I paid like 100 bucks for 2 grams or something like that.&nbsp; Most foreign people I know who live there are way too scared of trying to score drugs because of all the harsh punishments and the undercover work the police there do, and they wouldn&#039;t dare order off here for example.<br /><br />As mentioned in the thread already shrooms were legal there for a long time in the early 2000&#039;s, so on a previous trip many years before I had some great times tripping shrooms all over Japan with an ex-girlfriend, that time I just went there mostly for a vacation.&nbsp; I would not recommend visiting the abandoned Nara Theme Park while tripping.&nbsp; Definitely a good place to get some horrifying visuals and creepy feelings going on!&nbsp; Me and a few friends were convinced we saw ghosts and shit, after we went wandering around there for hours after eating a bunch of fresh magic mushrooms.
