				You seriously can not find the information your looking for simply by running a google search? <br /><br />Dont answer that, cause if &#039;No&#039;, your doing something wrong.. if &#039;Yes&#039;, you wouldnt have thought to post this question on the SR forums. heh. Good luck with that man.

				Haha its always &quot;I found it on the ground&quot; with you guys, then &quot;how do I completely wipe it and sell it&quot;. What you COULD do is stop stealing phones and get a job like everyone else.<br /><br />Plus its always the expensive phones that you fuckers find, Iphones and Galaxys. You&#039;ll never see a post on these forums about someone &#039;finding&#039; a flip-phone on the ground. No one steals flip phones or anything they cant make a quick dollar off of.<br /><br />Plus you know you&#039;re on the internet, and you have access to dozens of search engines where you could look that information up yourself instead of asking strangers on an anonymous drug forum

Based on this number, you can check some information about the device, eg brand or model. All the cellular carriers share a central &quot;blacklist&quot; database they all can access, so if you call and say &quot;yeah, i want to activate this phone, they ask for the IMEI number, then they search the database, and if shows up in this database its listed as &quot;blacklisted&quot; and you&#039;ll never be able to activate it with any carrier <br /><br />so good luck with that.

It might have important information on there and contacts. Someone will most likely try and ring it anyway, if it &quot;lost,&quot; to try and find out where they left it.<br />Don&#039;t be selfish.
