				High sex is alright!<br /><br />I&#039;ll never forget the first time back in 1984 I got my groove on with a nice spliff to set the mood. And since then, I&#039;ve always used weed lightly and sparingly, sometimes with years between -until now, I&#039;m hitting the green like tenmen ...maybe it&#039;s a mid-life crises thing...<br /><br />Since 21 I&#039;ve used amyl (or good quality isobutyl) pretty much in 4-6 month apart binges, and I do mean binges... I found a way to hit the vapor so I could keep a psycho-sexual arousal state of really warm rushi-ness just cascading for hours on end. I&#039;d get blue extremities from oxygen depletion in my bloodstream, sometimes a rash on my nostril, and a hacking dry cough, then came the killer headaches a few hours later, everything in my vision would look greenish, at the peak, just after orgasm, sometimes I&#039;d &#039;meet with&#039; my &#039;demon self&#039; inside my head, all weird shit to be sure... then about a year or two ago, it started to make my dick shrink instead of pulse with blood engorged desire.<br /><br />I&#039;m a sex-addict (porn/sex/both) so maybe that -and the drugs- keep people mistaking me for mid 30&#039;s early 40&#039;s, I should look older, but maybe not drinking for 7 years in my 20&#039;s helped too, who knows. (sorry about the narcissistic preening but i think it&#039;s relevant at my age -nearly 51). I also remember reading in a smart-drugs book that amyl donates to the body a certain chemical that is supposedly a youth-prolonging naturally ocuring substance we don&#039;t otherwise release in great quantity, I don&#039;t recal what this substance is, but anyway...<br /><br />Speaking of youth, I have no kids (that i know of) and no intention of becoming Peter Griffin at this late stage.<br /><br />Every drug I&#039;ve EVER used has been for sexual enhancement: alcohol (in the early days) weed, amyl, coke (twice only), deprenynl, meth (too bad about meth-dick otherwise it&#039;s almost perfect for sex!) aMT (too &#039;mellow&#039;). Shrooms&#039; (once, very sexy, but unable to have sex due to the setting!) E&#039;s well... I can get &#039;there&#039; naturally without these, they were too &#039;Pollyanna&#039; for bedtime, I like sex to have a dark edge to it!<br /><br />I&#039;m here to try LSD, 2 c-b, mescaline, and a few of the RC&#039;s I heard are fun in the sack.<br /><br />I find Cialis can help with meth-dick, but still, I don&#039;t like the tweaks coming down off that shit. Meth&#039;s good fun fucking a particular lady friend when she&#039;s on it as she gets multi-orgasmic...<br /><br />My bottom line is I want the drugs I use to keep enhancing sex, not subsume (replace) it, that&#039;s why I&#039;m lukewarm with meth, coke, and other stims. Seems from what I hear, the &#039;psychs&#039; are the way to go, or rather, cum...<br /><br />What&#039;s your poison?

				I&#039;ve had sex on acid before, and its amazing. Words don&#039;t do it justice. Masturbation, too, if you can&#039;t find a partner. I would say meth is the best pure feeling-wise, though; once you fight through the meth dick and get hard, and if you can handle the few hours it takes to come, dear God its like an explosive tantric orgasm, shit lasts for multiple minutes. Almost too intense, though, and you don&#039;t want to do it too often or it starts to burn out that part of your brain. Good ol&#039; cannabis can be nice as well.

				Best orgasm of my life last weekend on three hits of munchies WoW LSD.<br />No shit!<br />It was just amazing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard good things about 2C-B from Alexander Shulgin, and he&#039;s pretty old, so it must be good.

				mdma is awesome and i dont get any sides from it, mixed with the right amount of alcohol you get that stupid fun, slightly fumbly experience. <br />mushrooms make things feel too primitive and atavistic (lizardy&nbsp; :o ). I def prefer fun to spiritual or enlightening (with both sex and drugs).<br />can&#039;t wait to try on 2c-b, still haven&#039;t had the chance to try it.

				I like opiates or MDMA. Codeine, hydrocodone, things like that, they make me feel really empathetic and lovey-dovey, I love having sex while I&#039;m on them. They change a few minutes of humping into this huge, passionate ordeal that I can&#039;t really explain, ahahaha! I once had some orange 007 ecstasy pills, but I&#039;m almost certain there was more than MDMA in them, because the roll was very visual, but it was probably the best thing I&#039;ve ever felt. The few times I took those, my boyfriend&#039;s dick was jesus&#039; dick LOL! EVERYTHING was amazing on those, I washed my hands for 10 minutes just cause the water felt awesome. ;D<br /><br />Forgive me for being a dummy, but can someone enlighten me as to what amyl nitrite is? I&#039;ve really never heard of it in my life! Wikipedia say&#039;s it&#039;s called &quot;poppers&quot;. Does it work in the same way for women, even though we don&#039;t have dicks to suck all the blood out of us? Lol! I&#039;m just curious, I&#039;ve never heard of poppers.

				Any amphetamine type substance will do for me but I actually prefer ephedrine. It&#039;s already giving you good body rushes, that orgasm just magnifies it to the nth degree. It&#039;s the best sex ever.

				Methylone is the sexiest drug I&#039;ve ever taken. It drives my libido insane. It makes me limp as a noodle and it&#039;s almost impossible to orgasm to but man does it feel good rubbing against my bedpost. 15-18 hours wanking sessions are not uncommon. No joke. You can form blisters if you&#039;re not careful.<br /><br />Methylone mixed with butylone can eradicate your inhibitions. The mix can leave you very clear-headed while making it impossible to tell if you&#039;re under the influence. It&#039;s never gotten me in trouble but it has gotten me in a couple of pretty embarrassing situations. Be forewarned, it can make an exhibitionist out of anyone.<br /><br />My best orgasms are still with pot. Nothing really comes close to those wonderful, final moments.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying 2c-b.<br /><br />P.S. Has anyone else become addicted or at least continued taking drugs because of sex? I know it&#039;s the main reason I take drugs.

Most are taken by surprise, the very first rush is not necessarily &#039;euphoric&#039;.<br /><br />It is a vasodialator (opens up the blood vessels) it is NOT leather cleaner, that&#039;s some dumb marketing ploy to keep it on the shelves. it was discovered in 1916 and used for angina, but has long been superseded by more efficient products (that give the patient no rush).<br /><br />Think of it like an adrenaline hit, like you feel after a winning fight, skydive, or bungee. Along with the rush you get an instant full-body blush, and your heart races like a jackrabbits. Later the blood reverses direction and is dragged back toward the internal organs.<br /><br />Most women complain it gives them an instant headache! One needs to learn to channel the sensations to ones er, loins. Oral sex on it is fantastic! Especially for girls that get the channeling thing going, I&#039;m told. <br /><br />It does indeed also make anal sex a breeze, loosens up that arse in a jiffy! (taking pleasure in receptive anal sex is another &#039;learned&#039; response, and well worth the effort, be you boy, girl, gay or even straight! But that&#039;s for another post! ;-)<br /><br />Maybe my psycho-sexual experiences with it are just &#039;programmed&#039; ...in any case I want and need a better more sophisticated sex-high these days.

				Depends on what you consider good sex though, doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />The best sex I ever had was a threesome where I was so rippped on multiple substances I barely had an erection....so if I was prone to &quot;performance anxiety&quot; it might have been the worst sex I ever had.....<br /><br />As it was, I was not suffering from that (not that particular time, anyway, lol) It felt maybe more like a fukt up lesbian threesome than a guy and two girls. The dick was incidental, and didnt try to dominate the situation, as it is prone to do. :D<br /><br />The ladies seemed to appreciate this, and I was more concerned with devouring them than impaling them, so it worked for me too.<br /><br />Also, when things get too penis focused then you suffer from the inevitable downs between the ups. and a dick centered orgasm tends to make you feel full for a while, where you couldn&#039;t even eat a &quot;wafer thin mint&quot;. Without that happening, we went on for hours and hours hehe&nbsp; :P<br /><br />As much as I love a good porno style rut, sex for me is more in the mind - if you get truly tuned into each other then it can be mind blowing....<br /><br />

				For some god-sex, try a moderate to heavy dose of 25i-NBOMe. Thought I was a divine 2c-warrior descended from the heavens. So did my partner. That was intense! <br /><br />Cannabis is pleasant. It allows me to focus solely on the hotness going on. I&#039;m usually pretty ADHD but it seems to limit me to what&#039;s actually happening. Plus, it feels nice. <br /><br />MDMA is fantastic.

				Alcohol.&nbsp; Makes it more difficult to get off, but amazing for me if I get there.<br /><br />At one point, I&#039;d say MDMA, but after bad sex experiences on LSD, sex on hallucinogens has lost its appeal.<br /><br />Would like to try it on coke, but don&#039;t really like the idea of snorting.

				yakyak, good to hear you&#039;re still doing all right at home after what appears to be some time together, i can relate to your anticipation on the chemical post arriving in time for xmas! All the other guys on the block are probably bracing for socks, ties, and old spice, poor bastards. ;D<br /><br />I am waiting for 2c-b, LSD, 25i-NBOMe all of which I&#039;ve never tried, and all of which are psychedelics and supposedly remarkable sex enhancers.<br /><br />I know that mushrooms for me were super erotic, and that was surprising, as I merely took them to see pretty colors! Its also interesting that some people just don&#039;t seem to channel sex into any of their chemical experiences, that makes me think that in many cases, YMMV. <br /><br />But i hold high hopes, and hope to bring you all some insight and excitement in forthcoming trip reports.<br /><br />Just before i found SR I bought some aMT from a headshop&nbsp; while overseas, the caps were tiny, they looked like they would have been no more than 10mg bu there was no way to tell and i had no scales with me. They cost £40 for 4! I pluged one and felt a little bodyload after an hour, sort of like a hangover without the headache, soon this was replaced with a laid back relaxed feeling that lasted about 6-8 hours, but it was nothing special, the following night i plugged 2 with the forth and final cap about 3 hours into the trip, again, same sensations, but a litttle stronger, plus i was doing crap meth, shotgunned by my date, and a tiny amount of some JWH derivative, the overall result was mixed, nothing too spectacular one way or the other, it was just sloppy sexy good fun, i suppose... I&#039;m looking for much more sexual intensity with the psych family, but we shall see!<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to order some form of stims, maybe coke, or various meth type stims, but I&#039;m worried about their detectability in the shipping, that, and their negative effects on my chemmed-up erectile capacity... I think amyl would be pretty intense on LSD with sex, but if I do that i need to stay the hell away from ANY type of cialis or viagra as maxing out on vasodiolators can result in fatal blood pressure drops. I&#039;m still pondering this all but will probably give the amyl one more chance with the psychs, and if it is below par for any reason, I&#039;ll wait an hour or so and try a little of my dates&#039; crappy meth and maybe pop a cialis when the amyl has dissipated into the bloodstream (about 2 hours should be a safe enough gap). Hmmm amyl on top of meth, that sounds a little edgy too, although i think my dick might shrivel to the size of plankton.... :-[<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think pilly willy is just something you have to deal with if you don&#039;t want to use viagra. From the come up til the end of the plateau, I have shrunken, non functioning genitalia&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\&nbsp; Absolutely fine the second I start to come down though.<br />Finishing is another matter. Big pharma could make a blockbuster premature ejaculation drug based on MDMA. I personally have to put every ounce of willpower into getting the job done, you can almost feel your brain struggling to reroute itself.

				Coke or acid. Tough call. Maybe both but I never tried that. I can go forever on either one. Visuals are amazing on acid<br /><br />PS Honorable mention goes to GHB, especially combined with methylone but that&#039;s not one, so if i had to pick ONE it would still be coke or acid. I&#039;ve had multiple orgasms on all of those 3, ya I&#039;m a dude&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />PPS I never even WANT to have sex on MDMA nor for the rest of the day after pretty much

				Hi all,<br /><br />Back from xxxmas break with some discoveries...<br /><br />Firstly, 2c-b does not seem to do much for me (that I can discern) up to 30mg. Tried it with a Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor blend, a little crappy Crystal Meth (from Thailand) and lots of an Amyl-type inhalant from Australia labelled only &#039;Satyr&#039;.<br /><br />There was mild nausea waves from the 2c-b on the come-up but nothing to worry about, and on the second attempt I found regular motion sickness pills bought OTC will quell this.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll need to try 35mg 2c-b without other chems, at least until I get some sort of &#039;peak&#039; based on time ingested rather than &#039;feelings&#039;. <br /><br />Having said that, how could one NOT have a good time with all that shit onboard, and a willing grrl?<br /><br />I just found the 2c-b did not seem to &#039;shine&#039; or potentate/enhance/complex/compliment any of the others.<br /><br />The second discovery was a little &#039;out-there&#039;... <br /><br />I dropped 20mg (a full tab) of Cialis and then pigged out on Amyl derivative. This combo is potentially FATAL.<br /><br />Age-wise I&#039;m THE dirty ol man of SR, I&#039;m past 50, not exactly superfit, but in better shape than many my age. <br /><br />Anyhoo my second &#039;finding&#039; is that I have thus far survived 2 nights of Amyl/Cialis without any ill effects other than the usual headache. I only took one Cialis as it&#039;s well known the drug works up to 36 hours. <br /><br />My erection, even after considerable meth use and a substantial body fatigue load was reliable about 85% percent of the time, and if it died, a little mental stimulation or a change of position etc. quickly revived it.<br /><br />According to the contraindications on the Cialis box, I should be dead! I think that the much touted and potentially deadly Viagra/Cialis + Amyl combo is, like many big pharma warnings, a little overdone. <br /><br />My own observations and self-experimentation indicate that a long-term frequent users of Amyl type inhalants with no underlying heart health issues will probably survive, and if not, well whatta way to go.. during intense sex! :P<br /><br />I have also just come into possession of some of ENBOOM&#039;s 2ci NBOMe blotters and Lysander Spooners LSD, and will be reporting on sex under the influence of these in due course. <br /><br />As well as a more powerful 2c-b dose... stay tuned.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d have to say the most intense sex was on Methylone, and before that it was some pretty pure Molly.&nbsp; The methylone made me a whole lot more touchy feely when we were at the concert, once alone it was go time for a few hours. The orgasm was through the roof, and looking forward to trying it again soon.

				Was on some legal highs fairly recently at a party which didn&#039;t work at all. Then was upstairs a little with this properly fucking super-model sexy blonde girl I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d have a chance with. Needless to say the only thing the pills done for me was made my dick unable for use for the next couple of days.<br /><br />Stick to real drugs.

				Post by: <strong>murungu</strong> on <strong>February 03, 2012, 04:05 pm</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello again roadsters,<br /><br />I recently tried 25i NBOMe from vendor ENBOOM (kudos to ENBOOM his shit is &#039;the shit&#039;!) and the now-banned &#039;kronic&#039; which is the brand name of an unidentified synthetic cannabinoid that was until recently openly available downunder. <br /><br />Unfortunately I was solo for this little sexual adventure, but nevertheless it was quite fun. <br /><br /><br />The whole trip began around 11pm. I took one tab/blotter of 25i NBOMe and held it in my mouth for 30 minutes, trying not to swallow the saliva, and swirling it around in there now and again. it is bitter, but no worse than baking soda.&nbsp; I surfed the net to pass the time. I then simply swallowed the tab and the saliva after that time. This substance does take an hour to get an alert, and another hour to peak. So factor this in before you plan to party.<br /><br />After the first hour and a half I was getting strong alerts which were to me like&nbsp; a strange out-of-my-own-mind-looking-in feeling I began to hit the kronic, and continuet to hit the kronic about 3 times on average once an hour, which is when I&#039;d feel the &#039;stone&#039; wearing off a little. 3 hits of kronic means just 3 individual inhalations, each inhalation is packed fresh and comprised of just a few speckles of kronic in a bowl, and held in the lungs for about 30 seconds, as just a tiny amount of synth gets one to where one wants to be, and smoking it in vast bowls like it were weed will only make one violently ill.<br /><br />This combo produced similarities to what I&#039;ve felt on meth, only less intense, and of course none of the negatives associated with tina. Now, anyone who has been lucky enough to taste, and then walk away from meth/tina -before it hooks you bad- will know that finding a viable alternative to use in bed is a good thing. Meth is a contract with the devil in my opinion, but anyway, back to the story...<br /><br />Anyway, my grrl was away, I was alone, did not want to wait, and so I had to use porn as my partner :-) After about 2 hours post ingestion, the combo of the NBOMe and kronic worked well to transport me &#039;inside&#039; the action, and felt I could &#039;roll&#039; with the screen action seemingly for hours. There were also small spikes of euphoria out of nowhere which is a thing I have gotten on meth, but very much unlike meth, the the 25i made me very orgasmic. Seriously, I lost count of my &#039;pops&#039; but I think at least SIX in a 4-5 hour session, bear in mind my age usually permits me around 2 maybe 3 pops a night -then I&#039;m about done (that&#039;s sober). The orgasms were intense too, each time they were as intense as the last, and I needed to sit there all goooey and trashed for a few minutes, and wait till my head stopped spinning! ;-) <br /><br />About 4am I cleaned myself up, and made a peanut butter and honey toasted sandwich, and it tasted like that peanut and honey sandwich had been made by the Mother of all Masterchefs! Unbelievable! (I don&#039;t usually go for this kind of food at all) the mouth feel, honestly, it was almost as good as the sex! During the snack break i kind of got this other &#039;meth&#039; type alert, where your head is saying -no urging you- to get off again as soon as possible, now by this time I had cum a lot, as I just graphically described, but my body/mind is like urging, more, more, more! :-) <br /><br />I suffered no nausea from eating, and I drank a lot of sparkling mineral water too throughout the trip, about 3 litres. Jerking off like a man posessed made me get a little warm as you can imagine... <br /><br />About 4-5 hours into the trip (time gets rubbery, sometimes it crawls, then zooms!) I got really clear-headed insights, but as I&#039;m facing some unavoidable but self-imposed life-changing moves soon (I&#039;m talking major career and geographic changes) these insights were not particularly illuminating, but seemingly troubling, so rather than sit there in my own self-doubts at who knows what hour in the pre-dawn morning, I went back to the PC and hit the porn again, the &#039;little head&#039; took over again and obliged, happily.<br /><br />The sun came up and I was still full of energy, but had done with the masturbation marathon at last, mind still running at high speed, but more positive than earlier, I ate a little cereal and went to sleep at around 9am, waking late in the afternoon with no hangover, and no negative feelings, just a little &#039;foggy&#039; which i put down to the kronic.<br /><br />If you want a big night on 25i whether alone or with company, I recommend you set the whole night aside for it. Also, I&#039;d suggest both/all participants take a blotter, as you will likely run any &#039;sober&#039; participant(s) ragged with your sexual appetite, unless they are themselves some sort of sex-fiend by nature!<br /><br />I have used this chem twice, and results were consistent. It can be used in quick succession (I had a night off then repeated the event with no diminishing return noted). I had no visuals, because I was deliberately dosing low to chase the pro-sexual rather than the &#039;trippy&#039; side of the chem.&nbsp; I want to experience LSD first, then I may go back and try 25i at higher &#039;trippy&#039; doses. <br /><br />There is very little on Erowid about this compound, most of the reports there talk about 25c NBOMe. And most of those were using ridiculously high doses with negative outcomes. These NBOMe compounds are designed to mimic 2cb, 2ci, as far as I can determine from Erowid. The NBOMe family are reported to be more potent on a per-dose level than 2cxx by magnitudes of around ten times! <br /><br />Interestingly, I tried some 2cb in low-moderate dose 20-30mgs in December and was disappointed. I have 100mg left and will be trying 50mg and will report back at some point.<br /><br />In summary, I found 25i NBOMe is a great pro-sexual chem, it produces both insatiable desire and stamina, there are NO speed-dick malfunctions to worry about, and you get to cum like a geyser! What&#039;s not to love? And... I still have 8 blotters left... woo fucking hoo!<br /><br />Cheers, m.<br />
