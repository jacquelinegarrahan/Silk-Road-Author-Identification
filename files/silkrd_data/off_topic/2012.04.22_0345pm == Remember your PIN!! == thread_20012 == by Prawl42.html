				One point of confusion is when signing up, you were asked to create a &quot;secondary password,&quot; but when you make a purchase, it&#039;s referred to as a &quot;PIN.&quot;&nbsp; People assume since it&#039;s a PIN, it must be a couple digit numerical password, which usually isn&#039;t the case.<br /><br />However, I have no idea why people are posting about it on the forums.&nbsp; No one on here can do anything about it - you have to PM SR Support.&nbsp; At least they&#039;re generally keeping it to one thread, which you can choose to ignore.&nbsp; I&#039;m more annoyed by the BTC panhandling going on, because every person begging for money creates a new thread.&nbsp; But I have the ability to ignore those threads and not open them, too, so I can&#039;t really complain about that either.

				It was way back in the early days of SR that it was called a &quot;secondary password.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt that that&#039;s why they can&#039;t remember it.

				It&#039;s really stupid the way it&#039;s done. First of all, when you sign up, you just want to see the website, you haven&#039;t necessarily decided to buy anything. Months can go by when you finally do and it&#039;s called a different thing, like you necessarily remember your secondary password anyway, let alone a PIN. And of course when you send money to your account you have no idea that you&#039;re going to need this &quot;password&quot; because it never tells you what it&#039;s for at any point. So you send your money to your account like the instructions tell you and all of a sudden you&#039;re missing something you never knew you needed, were never informed the purpose of and isn&#039;t even called the same thing. So it&#039;s not surprising that people come here panicking that they may have lost a shitload of money from this system.

				The solution to all this is to install TrueCrypt on your computer and then encrypt your hard drive, then create a encrypted hidden folder and then have a coded word document for all your pin/password info. Make sure you use triple-cascade encryption on both your hard drive encryption and your hidden folder and then job really is a good&#039;un.<br /><br />I still like the hunting idea though.

And I don&#039;t know for sure but I reckon that rifle would go through the armour of the Land Rover. There is no way any of my ballistic armour would resist it. Anti-Material rifles aren&#039;t for people really anyway, they are for taking out people behind walls and satellites or specific tactical targets. If you tried to shoot a badger or something with one you wouldn&#039;t find it after, or maybe you would but just sprayed over a field. Would be fucking A to have one though, would have a field day if there was a zombie invasion with it. You could go through about a 20 zombie heads at once.
