				Hey everyone. <br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve taken a liking to perusing these forums and, as with most forums I use, I like to familiarize myself with the regulars. I recognize tons of vendors, but the normal users themselves seem just as badass. Since most threads discuss a particular topic and do not really encourage casual conversation, I felt I&#039;d make this thread if anyone was interested in introducing themselves and/or having a chat with some of the other members.<br /><br />I personally am in my early 20s, live in Illinois, and took an interest in drugs when I was in high school, during which I studied my ass off learning psychopharmacology and organic chemistry. I wound up majoring in psychology, and am still going to school. In my spare time I trip/roll/lean my ass off. It&#039;s an enjoyable lifestyle.<br /><br />Now it&#039;s your turn! Tell a little about yourself: Some of your favorite drugs, vendors, interests, aspirations, dreams, hopes, whatever you feel like. This is the off-topic board, after all.<br /><br />Do not give any details that might reveal your identity (obviously). If you wish to specify a location, I would not do so past the province/state/territory you live in.

				Hello, broken string.<br /><br />I&#039;m the Airship Admiral, Grand Fleet Admiral for the Youth Liberation Air Force.<br /><br />I&#039;m an activist, revolutionary, volunteer and free culture advocate.<br /><br />I love open source software, dogs, kids, and anarchy.<br /><br />My opinion of government could be summed up as monstrous abominations that need to be put down like sick violent dogs with cancer and rabies.<br /><br />I sell drugs to fund a dog rescue and no-kill shelter, a teen abuse shelter, and certain open source software projects that will go unnamed. If I do well enough, I&#039;m hoping to establish a local makerspace and communal laboratory and workshop.<br /><br />Pleased to meet you.

Truly inspiring. Although I&#039;d like to hear more about your philosophical views; what is it about governments that you hate so much? I&#039;d love to hear you explain it in your own words, preferably with more analogies to euthanasia. Adds flair.
