				Well Im coming up on some shrooms here and thought... Man I like the same old eigth trip but how about something more. I decided, order mushbuds 10 gram special and blast off. But I dont want to go nuts or anything. So I ask my silk road family for advice&nbsp; :) I plan to either take the shrooms by myself at home, or maybe in a graveyard with friends at night. I have always loved the graveyard.<br /><br />I also plan to take 3 of litescapes whole plant hash caps, to aim the bodyload in a more comfortable direction. I may also drink a 40 oz if the bodyload gets to be too intense.

				Write a trip report. also its reassuring to know mushbud came through for ya :) make sure you 5/5. although a 4/5 might be more appropriate because the 5/0 are probably all 5/5ing you know? a 4 out of 5 should be the new 5/5 and a vendor with nothing but 5/5 should be ousted! just spewing insanity, don&#039;t mind me. :)

				Yeah JI&#039;ll write a double trip report of the whole plant hash caps with the shrooms. Probably wont even feel the weed capsules while tripping but they cant hurt yknow.<br />Is drinking a 40 oz safe on shrooms?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve always been told to stay away from alcohol when on shrooms (something about the sugar or something breaking the active ingredients down, but might just be an old wifes tale) but I have to say I admire your style sir ! Had a few heavy experiences on them myself, I love that shit and will wait eagerly for your report. Enjoy it bud :)

				I&#039;ve done a couple of heroic doses. I&#039;d be shocked if you&#039;re interested in drinking. I&#039;d recommend spending at least part of the time outside, but make sure you&#039;ve got a sitter. Can do some pretty weird shit when you&#039;re tripping that hard.

				I ate 1/4 of shrooms once.&nbsp; I lost all contact with reality.&nbsp; I ended up pissing my pants just because I wasn&#039;t aware I had to pee, and that I had been holding it for quite some time.&nbsp; It was scary trip, but good times were had.

				I&#039;d highly suggest a trip sitter.&nbsp; On 7g I was barely operative.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to have someone that can at least check on you every once in awhile to make sure you&#039;re not hurting yourself.&nbsp; Overall though just prepare for one hell of a fun trip! :P

				Call me conservative (that&#039;s the last thing I am) but I would definitely recommend against this. That&#039;s just wayyyyy too much, unless you are a real shroom hardhead. Past a certain point there are diminishing returns. Go easy, mac.

				Thats what i&#039;m talking about :)<br /><br />i reach dmt land with doses. there is a whole new level to shrooming once you get past about 10 grams.&nbsp; you can&#039;t walk talk or even sense regular reality at the peak.&nbsp; Your stuck and completely in hyperspace with insane visuals. 5 grams isn&#039;t a heroic dose, especially in comparison to 10 or 15+ grams of strong shrooms.<br /><br />to mentally prepare, just make sure you have no interruptions.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t suggest going to the graveyard until after your peak, sounds like a horrid idea; your set and setting should be completely comfortable, and alone is ideal.&nbsp;

				What can he say? it looked like a mushroom and he wanted more! XP <br />really though dude there are tons of trance tracks on youtube you can set and forget. indian, native american, oriental, electro, industrial those are all good and you can check them out before hand to make sure its the right vibe. if your particularly fond of having heart attacks load up that soothing video that ends with a zombie screaming at you suddenly.lol. no, please, please don&#039;t. but really besides that there are also such things as &#039;binaural&#039; tracks which never worked for me but might work for you if your tripping and you can concentrate on whats supposed to happen. then there are hypnosis tracks which I always thought would be more effective on while tripping. <br />last for best here though pal, nothing agains zombie or tool (not really a tool fan but whatevs) the music you want probably wont be hard rock. try for something that has a lot of undertones. gorillaz comes to mind. but I think that the ONLY thing WORTH LISTENING to would be surround sound pink floyd. My personal fav album being Atom*Heart*Mother (which includes the fifteen minute long &quot;Alans Psychedelic Breakfast). If I had a sweet girl friend /&#039;just friend&#039; or whatevs and some pretty woods to walk through on the way to a lake and a set of mp3s you guys set off at the same time to listen to some floyed on your walk there I think that&#039;d be the best. <br />otherwise if your set on going rock go with some english power rock like Iron Maiden which has stories that are clear and easy to follow and envision(because their songs are based on books) or go with something that is a concept album so that every track relates to the last. just stay far far away from the wall (although it might be interesting if you and your friend both listen to the wall and start to feel this intense togetherness as you hold hands) <br />

				Haha, I find after a certain point with shrooms the law of diminishing returns certainly applies. I find there to be no point to going above 8 or so grams as serotonin receptors become fully saturated and at that point your tripping extremely hard anyways. I have done it but doses over 8 grams seem to only increase the nausea and somatic effects from other serotonin receptor subtypes and not the visuals and euphoria from 5ht2a agonism. You only have so many 5ht2a receptors so only so much psilocybin can bind to it, the ceiling is different for everyone but if you dose high enough you will find that you definitely have one. This is what keeps shrooms and LSD from having the capacity to be lethal in reasonable doses.

				Well that was a very interesting trip. I ate the 10grams of mushbuds shrooms on pretty much an empty stomach, and heres what happened.<br /><br />About half an hour later I knew I was gonna have some kind of intense experience. The only more intense psychedelic trips I&#039;ve had were once when I took a 10-strip of acid (that was just insane tbh... not sure if I leaned from that one) and strangely once I had an eigth of golden teachers that was incredibly strong (maybe my mindset was just really sensitive to shrooms that day?)<br />So it was four o clock when I took the shrooms. I rolled around on my bed for (2 hours? There was time dilation) This part of the experience was the most visual, and I felt very connected to the universe. I felt like everything was at my fingertips and the world was my oyster(dont even know what that really means) but that thought came into my head and it just cilcked.<br />I checked the time and around 7:00 my trip for some reason turned bad. I felt like some energy wanted me to confront my suicidal thoughts which I dont always think about. I realized the reason I wanted to commit suicide didnt really have to do with my life situations, just my mindset. I for some reason thought that if I committed suicide, I&#039;d transcend what I view as a narrow-minded, controlling society, to enter DMT hyperspace as a light-being. Some energy warned me I hadnt learned everything I needed to, and that a natural death would eventually allow me to enter a hyperspace/void where I would see my true self and then carry on from there based on choices. Thats all I was told on the subject from the energy. I was frustrated by this and tried to communicate to the energy that I WAS ready to move on past my earthly form and that I felt I wasnt learning anything. Then a bad feeling washed over me, and I endured an uncomfortable, yet bearable, state of mind for about an hour. I soon learned I could use this breathing technique to conquer it, so I started meditating. I meditated for maybe 3-4 hours, and when I opened my eyes the visuals were pretty much gone. I saw more CEV&#039;s than OEV&#039;s during this trip. In a way I kind of wish I&#039;d opened my eyes more, but I had to meditate to overcome a bad trip, and I did. <br /><br />I ate a meal, watched some breaking bad on tv, and went to bed about 12 hours after dosing. I feel like I want to try more shrooms (next time Id like to try 15 grams, maybe with acid too?) I also had a strong urge to buy DMT which I&#039;m now placing an order for. Will dmt work if I sandwitch it between tea leaves, and just let it cherry a bit?<br /><br />A day later I realize that the trip taught me to let go and meditate. I still have a subtle sense of calm, and I catch myself blankly staring at the sunset as I type this. I still have thoughts of suicide, but decided that if I&#039;m really gonna kill myself at a young age, I need to be fair and give it a good 6 months to think about. And if I still want to do it after 6 months of real thought... well.

				watched waking life. laughed in incredulity and profundity and absurdity. if you havnt seen it then....see it. felt different. had a tatally different frame of mind. realized things.sort of wish id never come down because it was ahealthier world veiw and now it slipped away. didnt enjoy 6 hours in the bathroom though. also had hoped for a welbutran experience that was transcendent but unlike welbutren in that I wouldn&#039;t be paranoid but I did not enter a different reality just a different self. now more then ever the contradictory facts that we create the electrical impulses in our brain that determine our reality as well as we react to the reality around us is evident. suicide still not seeming out of the question but definitely not looking to drag people into my bad juju as what will that accomplish? multiply bad juju? doesn&#039;t seem to make sense. did not manage to undergo hypnosis. did notice that our walls segragating us from nature are delusions because in the end we ARE in the wild , mosquitos are proof of that. we aren&#039;t above beseality and nature (I dont refer to sexual acts here) but we are the beastial just the same. patterns weren&#039;t so much seen as imagined. also its apparent that Im pretty impressive because I was certainly following the things that were imprinted in my mind recently. next time a couple adavans and shrooms with some guided theraputic hypnosis might benefit me greatly if I can figure out what to bother to hynotize myself with.

				Very interesting trip report, sounds like a powerful experience.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178653.msg1327027#msg1327027">Quote from: 2marijuanaman on July 11, 2013, 12:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Will dmt work if I sandwitch it between tea leaves, and just let it cherry a bit?<br />l.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, this will work. Hold the flame as far away as possible and as soon as it is cherried enough take away the flame, at first pull slowly to get it lit and then once it&#039;s going well pull a bit harder.<br /><br />Good luck, buddy.
