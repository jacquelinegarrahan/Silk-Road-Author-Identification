				I&#039;ve just been dragged into an argument on a thread where some guy reckons he&#039;s been scammed by a new vendor. Apparently he handed over 350$ out of escrow. I ordered a sample off the same vendor and it came through fine so I&#039;m not going to mention the vendors name.<br /><br />The point I want to make here is the stupidity of some people, everywhere you look on these forums there are people screaming about scammers. And they get the same answer EVERY time, STAY IN ESCROW!<br />Now this buyer can obviously find and use the forums so why didn&#039;t he take this advice FFS!<br />Ok, it can be hard for new buyers with no rating, but if you feel you have absolutely no choice but to go OOE at least order the smallest amount you can. 350$? That&#039;s just plain fucking stupid.<br /><br />So here I am, fouling up the forums with yet another thread about scammers and escrow. Fucking pointless.<br />Go ahead, find a new vendor and give them all your fucking money, get it over and done with.<br />Will you get sympathy when you get scammed? Not from me you won&#039;t.

				It&#039;s alright to complaint. So we can tell who might be selective scams.

				I never buy from someone unless they have at least 99% approval and over 100 transactions.<br /><br />Between that and staying in escrow, I&#039;m guessing 99% of scams never would have happened.<br /><br />I mean really, how many HIGHLY rated vendors have scammed people IN escrow? Compared to sub-99%/sub-100 transactions and OUT of escrow transactions? It&#039;s gotta be 1 in 100.<br /><br />
