				From what I can tell you can punch/kick a car enough to the point it starts letting off a grayish smoke, and as you continue to kick/punch the car the smoke will turn to a thick black smoke, then if you keep at it a fire will ignite in the engine and the car will blow up within seconds.<br /><br />*You can also use weapons such as bats/crowbars for faster explosions*<br /><br /><br />But, for safety I would recommend buying a weapon at a local Ammu-Nation or actually now that I think about it there is a place down near the Pay-n-Spray that will strap your car with c4 and give you the detonator to do the dirty. In my opinion this is the best way, because it completely cuts out the middle man.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				throwing a lit cigarette down the fuel tank doesn&#039;t work.. already tried it..<br /><br />easiest way would be to pour petrol over and in the car, then through a match or lit cigarette or zippo lighter on it... then take a few steps back..

				protip: if you&#039;re throwing gas inside the car to light it, leave windows or doors open. i once poured gas through a slightly open sunroof and threw in a burning piece of paper. the shit went up but suffocated itself out almost immediately. i even saw the guy driving it the next day so it did pretty much no damage at all, lol.

				Well placed thermite, detonated remotely via 20 feet of magnesium wire. You can also place containers of gasoline in the car for an additional explosion when the thermite is ignited. Should make for an unbelievable explosion and whatever remains should be shredded like metallic cheese.<br /><br />Just one warning: you have to get the mag wire RIGHT or you&#039;ll earn yourself an instant closed casket funeral. Otherwise you can watch from a safe distance and break out the marshmallows and weenies. I&#039;d like to see some footage too&nbsp; ;D
