				hello everyone ,<br /><br />we are new sellers and desperate for some first few sales.&nbsp; We have listings as cheap as $9.99 with free shipping .&nbsp; Full escrow of course.&nbsp; No risk.&nbsp; First time buyers welcome.&nbsp; Heck, try a new account out if you are worried about a cancellation at worst . <br /><br />Prices:<br /><br />- 1g = $9.99<br />- 1/8 = $36.<br />- 1/4 = $60.<br />- 1 oz = $220.<br /><br />every sales gets a free 30% added to their bag , plus the free shipping and hi stealth effort.&nbsp; We also use only MBB commercial-grade packaging for your safety.&nbsp; The very best.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; <br /><br />The weed is Blueberry x Kush, mostly Indica variety. Its the most potent and quality high of any strain we&#039;ve grown over the years.&nbsp; Its our personal favorite .&nbsp; &nbsp;A potent and long lasting buzz that can bring on couch-lock and a head -stone . <br /><br />It was harvested just two weeks ago and looking great.&nbsp; Picts of the garden are available. We are 100% organic hydro. Been growing for 18 years then found the road. <br /><br />Its worth a try.&nbsp; We are giving back 120% of each sale until June 12, 2013 - to get us started.&nbsp; Any tips or suggestions are appreciated.&nbsp; We also gladly pay for referrals.&nbsp; &nbsp;Send someone our way and msg us.&nbsp; We&#039;ll send you 20% of the sale.. <br /><br />Also no FE ever.

				good suggestion. thanks.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to this and lessons in forum ettiquette are appreciated. <br /><br />I was scared to post in the product offers section since we are new. learning. <br />Mods move if you can, thanks so much. <br /><br />We are also making BHO in limited quantities.&nbsp; This strain makes a bright yellow, hard-plastic like resin.&nbsp; It shatters like glass.&nbsp; The hash it makes is also transparent and hard. It gives a hangover the next day too.&nbsp; Very strong.<br /><br />We will post the resin preparations shortly for a very good price.&nbsp;

				Anyone know how to buy advertising space on the front page of SR?<br />We are looking for ad space anywhere in fact.&nbsp; Msg us if you are looking to earn some weed or coins. <br /><br />Its very hard to get established here.&nbsp; We lost our rating number beside our vendor name because of too few sales haha.&nbsp; <br />We are trying, but we are growers and not sales people lol.<br /><br />Lots of love from the garden.
