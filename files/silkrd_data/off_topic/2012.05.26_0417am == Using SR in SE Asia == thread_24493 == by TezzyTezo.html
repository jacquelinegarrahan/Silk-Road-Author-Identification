				I plan on moving to Thailand in the fall of this year (Bangkok specifically) and I am concerned that I may have to stop cannabis use altogether. :&#039;( From my research, LE has the right to conduct urine tests on the spot which could lead to a possible possession charge (a possible life sentence).&nbsp; With that being said, would I be able to utilize a service such as SR while living in Thailand? Has anyone ever shipped to places in SE Asia? Any bit of information helps.

				Sorry that i cant answer some of your questions,but im curious to know why you are moving there if they are such a-holes when it comes to cannabis? <br /><br />Also look into JWH&#039;s and other synthetic cannabinoids that replicate the high from MJ, but do not show up on any of the urinalysis&#039;s on the market today.

				You will be fine. Had a fantastic opium in Tajland. Depends where you planing to stay. If you start with hostel then your pretty much got all drug contact in reception. Even in Malaysia, where drugs are punishable by &quot;death&quot;, we have managed to&nbsp; source good weed and coke from locals. Once you settle down there, you will soon find that all LE is just bullshit to keep reputation and keep tourist coming.

				Dont worry about it man, as long as your discrete you can do whatever you like in Thailand, just don&#039;t fuck with the locals, and trust you will have NO problems getting good herb.<br /><br />and any Thai copper that asks you to pee in a cup is just looking for a bribe

				As people say.. No need to stop smoking because you are moving to Thailand!? Most young people goes to Thailand because we all know how fucked up it is. <br /><br />Since 2009 i live 6 months in Thailand (Bangkok/Samui) and 6 months in Europe and I do more shit in Thailand than in Europe thats for sure. The weed in Thailand sucks tho, you can develop better contacts that will give you the &quot;better&quot; bush weed... And you have Silk Road.<br /><br />Someone mentioned Koh Samui.. Sure you can go there for a vacation but that island gets disgusting after 3-4 months there as it is way to crowded with tourists and thai/burmese gang members that are fighting each other..&nbsp; TAT is doing everything they can to save the island as it is going dead so all kinds of people are there. One good thing about Samui tho, there is a lot of ice &amp; yaba.<br /><br />Bangkok... Woah, even more ice &amp; yaba over there, but much much harder to bribe the cops there, but if you look normal and not like a fucking hippie with dreads and and a disgusting beard - they are not likely to target you.

Are the cops in BKK known to perform random stops and searches on seemingly innocent farangs? If you maintain an inconspicuous profile could you still be subject to harassment from police purely on the basis of you being a foreigner? I&#039;ve heard accounts of police shutting down entire bars and performing a urinalysis on everyone as they left.

				I&#039;ve been visiting regularly since 05&#039; and managed to find the following: Weed (easy), Coke (quality is bad unless you got a good source, I was lucky), H (yum! beautiful tan rocks, used to meet my guy at the 7/11 every day for 6 months), Ketamine (tuk tuk driver who knew vet), benzos/pharmacy stuff (just gotta find the right one). And much more..<br /><br />Never had a problem, just gotta be willing to be generous with bribes and don&#039;t act like a wanker (you&#039;ll get what you deserve!).
