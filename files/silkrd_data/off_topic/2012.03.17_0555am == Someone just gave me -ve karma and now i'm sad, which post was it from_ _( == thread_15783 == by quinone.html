				Yes, we need to see the posts that were given karma and how it was rated. Without it you can be discredited akin to vendor shell accounts attacking other vendors.

				That&#039;d be nice if you could see what posts gave you karma.<br />So that people can improve their posts by knowing what&#039;s helpful and what&#039;s not.

				Meh, it&#039;s whatever for me. Karma seems like it&#039;ll be more effective in the long run, so it&#039;s usefulness just isn&#039;t apparent as of right now. Think about in a few months though, once it has been given enough time people will have earned a significant amount more or less Karma which will make a difference. Let&#039;s use moonbear as an example, he has a pretty hefty amount of negative Karma which makes it pretty apparent that he&#039;s not the nicest guy in town.<br /><br />I learned that knowing the culprit behind giving negative Karma isn&#039;t exactly a good thing either. If we all knew exactly what we did wrong, well sure we could learn from our mistakes and become a better person for it...But that&#039;s not really being true to ourselves. Basically, if we were aware of who gave us what kind of Karma we&#039;d probably become biased and would try to change each post in order to receive positive Karma which is lying. &quot;Lying is wrong, and bad. There should be a new, stronger word for lying like badwrong or badong. YES, lying is badong. From this moment, I will stand for the opposite of lying, gnodab.&quot;

				I don&#039;t care who gave someone + or -, I just want to see what they got voted for. Many times people seem to be getting - for saying the truth. My first - came right after I posted in the LSD thread about holding vendors accountable for false advertisement. I simply stated that if you don&#039;t know the strength, don&#039;t make something up and then respond &quot;you got your product you should be happy&quot; because that&#039;s total bullshit. If you buy 3.5g of weed and 1.5 you&#039;re going to be pissed, and rightfully so. LSD is very hard to 100% know for sure the dosage, but it&#039;s not hard to tell a 80ug hit vs a 300ug hit and advertise properly based on that..
