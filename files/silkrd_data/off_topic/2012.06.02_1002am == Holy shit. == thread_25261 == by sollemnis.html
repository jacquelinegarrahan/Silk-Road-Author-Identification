No, it was a little less dramatic than that :P Made a nice warm fire in a iron fire pit and all of a sudden the grass starts to flame.. <br />It looked so weird, like seeing an gasoline pool light on fire.<br />Now I know someone was messing with spirits but that couldn&#039;t have caused it because be spilled too little... I think. ::) <br /><br />
