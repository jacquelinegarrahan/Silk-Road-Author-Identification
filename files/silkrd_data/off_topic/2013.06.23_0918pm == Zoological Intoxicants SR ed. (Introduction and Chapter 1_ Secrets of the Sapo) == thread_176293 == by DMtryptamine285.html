				Here is the Introduction and excerpts First Chapter from a book I am working on called Our Chemical World: Zoological Intoxicants.<br />Unfortunately I cannot figure out how to add images to this, the actual text has pictures and tables.<br />Edited for silk road.<br /><br />Our Chemical World Is basically an encyclopedia of knowledge regarding psychotropic plants and animals, the fourth section focuses on animals which elicit psychoactive effects. Its kind of my own &quot;plants of the gods&quot; type of thing combined with a rather extreme form of gonzo journalism<br /><br />Copywrite (c) DMtryptamine285 all rights reserved.<br /><br /><div>Our Chemical World pt. 4<br />Zoological Intoxicants, a cutting edge frontier for Psychoactive Drug Research<br />(Silk Road Addition, With links to vendors when applicable)<br />Written by: DMtryptamine<br /><br />(Please note: I do not in any way advocate harming innocent animals for their psychoactive effects, many of the things mentioned here are downright toxic, and would kill you even in minute amounts. None the less, cultures which these animals are endogenous to have a history of using them for their intoxicating properties (anecdotally). This is for informational purposes only.)<br /><br />Table of Contents<br />1. Introduction<br />2. Secrets of the Sapo (Phyllomedusa Bicolor) *<br />3.

Today we are led to believe that this practice is taboo and hedonistic, a remnant of less “advanced” civilization, yet the very roots of our western philosophy and religious practice (Christianity), the very path from which we forged our empire, is laden with anecdotes of psychoactive drug use. In fact, the primary ingredient of the holy anointing oil of exodus (which all the holy men of the bible where anointed with,) fragrant cane is believed by many scholars to be cannabis. The original, and likely false translation, was calamus. Either way, be it cannabis or calamus the ingredient is psychoactive (calamus being a central nervous system stimulant, intoxicant, and purgative in high doses). Myrrh, another ingredient in the anointing oil which is transdermally active (can be absorbed through the skin) contains the compound furaneudesma-1-3-diene, which acts on opiate receptors in the brain. <br /><br />Exodus 30:23, Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus (originally fragrant cane) two hundred fifty shekels, <br /><br />The above passage is describing the process of compounding the holy anointing oil revered by the high priests of early Christianity. It’s not just Christianity that speaks of the practice of ingesting psychoactive substances; in fact, every culture I have studied has at least one reference to psychoactives, many of which are deemed illegal in today’s world. The native tribes in the Amazon have historically used and still use to this day the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca (which contains the schedule one drug, n,n-DMT, or dimethyltryptamine.) The Bawiti tribe in Africa makes use of the stimulating and hallucinogenic rootbark of the shrub Tabernanthe Iboga (containing ibogaine as its principal active constituent). Native Americans right here in the United States frequently use the now endangered cactus peyote (Lophophora Williamsii) for the hallucinogenic and stimulant properties of its active alkaloid mescaline hydrochloride.<br /><br />The consumption of psychoactive substances is not inherently morally wrong, any more so than human sexuality. Culturally it is seen as something of a rite of passage, a logical next step in becoming a man, and is deeply engraved into the intricate fabric of human psychology. No place is this more evident than in any football stadium across the country, where ethanol is ritualistically imbibed until one is teetering on the brink of alcohol poisoning, one giant mass display of public intoxication. <br /><br />The complex relationships between man and bioactive/psychoactive plants are now well understood, and are encompassed by the field of ethnobotany (ethno meaning culture, botany meaning the study of plants). It isn’t only plants and fungi that have a history of being utilized for both there healing and psychoactive properties. Certain animal excrete venoms which can elicit a mind-altering effect as well. The most well known of these animals is the bufo alvarius toad (Colorado river toad) and the cane toad (bufo marinus) which produce the potent hallucinogens N,N-DMT, and bufotenin (5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine).<br /><br />The bufo genus is not the only animal species in nature in which psychoactive compounds are found, however its one of the few we actually have a sufficient amount of data on. Psychoactive compounds are actually quite prevalent in the animal kingdom and offer a vast untapped resource of potential therapeutic and novel psychotropic compounds that are just now beginning to be understood by western science; yet native cultures have been utilizing them for eons. If we looked hard enough, we could find an entirely new pharmacopeia which could have the potential to treat some of societies most prevalent illnesses, both physiological and psychological. Now we will delve into the deep dark unknown that is ethnozoology and psychotropic animals.

It has a long history of use in certain panoan tribes (such as the katukina people), where it is used to enhance the senses, provide relief from fatigue, and aid in hunting game. It excretes toxic venom containing a large range of pharmacologically active compounds including opioid peptides, vasodilators, and cardiotoxins. There are many names for the excretions produced by the giant leaf frog, including but not limited to kambo, sapo, Leite do Sapo (translates to toad milk), Vacina do Sapo (translates to toad vaccine), and kambu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a recreational substance by any stretch of the imagination; it is a grueling ordeal that one should not undertake lightly. The traditional route of administration involves making small burns on the arms or legs (referred to as “dots”), The dried venom is then applied to the burned area after the area is cleaned. The first effects the user will feel is a rush of heat spreading out across the body and a rush of blood to the head. Heart rate begins to rapidly accelerate and ones pulse becomes audible, this is due to vasodilatation. Shortly after the onset of effects extreme nausea is felt, often resulting in a massive purge, it is recommended one be well hydrated before undergoing this ordeal or it could result in severe dehydration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the initial discomfort this medicine seems to unilaterally induce, it leaves the user with a euphoric afterglow, reduction of pain, a sense of boundless energy, and heightened senses. Many alternative medicine enthusiasts have suggested that kambo could have a use in treating fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Western pharmaceutical companies have also displayed an interest in the frog, and research is currently underway on many of the frog’s active constituents in an attempt to isolate the medicinal compounds while leaving behind the toxic and nauseating compounds. <br /><br /><div>Active Constituents of Phyllomedusa Bicolor<br /><br />[Dermorphin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mu-opioid receptor agonist<br />Deltorphin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delta-opioid receptor agonist<br />Phyllomedusin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tachykinin which affects the salivary glands, tear ducts, intestines, and bowels; it contracts the smooth muscles, and contributes to violent purging.<br /><br />Phyllokinin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vasodilator<br />Phyllocaerulein&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stimulates the adrenal cortex and the pituitary gland, causes a fall in blood pressure, causes tachycardia, and has a potent action on the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, and stimulates gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions.<br />Sauvagine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stimulates the adrenal cortex, causes a long lasting fall in blood pressure, and causes intense tachycardia.<br />Adenoregulin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts on the adenosine receptors.]<br /><br />Dermaseptin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antimicrobial for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and antiviral for herpes simplex virus<br />(Source: Kambo, scientific research and healing treatments by: Giovanni Lattanzi) </div><br />There are anecdotal reports which can be found on drug related websites regarding the use of pure dermorphin as a recreational substance. The substance is a potent opioid narcotic which is active in the microgram range so extreme caution must be taken when handling the compound. Users seem to have mixed opinions; some saying it rivals heroin (diacetylmorphine) and morphine, while others claim it to be more similar to hydrocodone/oxycodone in terms of euphoria and analgesia although this is likely dose dependant.<br /><br />What is perhaps most interesting about dermorphin is that evidence seems to suggest that it doesn’t build tolerance near as fast (if at all) as other opioid narcotics. If we can isolate the substance which is responsible for the positive/therapeutic effects of sapo/kambo then perhaps we can create new pain medications without near the addictive and tachyphylactic (tolerance building) properties, thus kambo may offer a novel means by which to mitigate opiate/opioid withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><div>My Experience With Kambo Sticks</div><br />“I was conversing with a friend of mine who utilizes kambo sticks in her shamanic practice and she suggested that I try them. My intention was to have her administer the medicine to me but alas something came up and I had to move out of town. She handed me a kambo stick and walked me through how to administer it via burning the skin. In the hustle and bustle of moving (leaving dallas and moving down to el paso, border city USA,) I had forgotten all about the kambo stick until one day re-discovering it at the bottom of my ethnobotanical collection (which I keep in a large Folgers coffee tub of all places.)<br /><br />One day I was just sitting around with absolutely nothing to do, looking forward to having a novel experience, and I remembered the Kambo stick. I was quite apprehensive about self administering what very well could be a deadly poison but hey, you only live once right. After doing a little bit of research I decided that three dots was a good starting dose. I took an incense stick and made three small round burns on my forearm. I proceeded to rather conservatively apply the venomous sap to the shoddy self mutilation I had conducted on my arm (which by the way, hurt quite a bit but It was surprisingly bearable, not sure there’s anything us psychonauts won’t do in the name of novelty.)<br /><br />I felt it immediately, within mere seconds I felt a heat rising from my arm up to my head extending out to the furthest reaches of my body, filling me with warmth from the very top of my skull down to extremities. It just kept getting hotter and hotter until I felt like I was on fire. At this point I noticed my heart beginning to beat faster and faster until it seemed as if it could explode at any minute, I found myself trying desperately to fight off panic eventually deciding that whatever is going to happen will happen and there is nothing I can do about it but go with the experience. I could hear my heartbeat throbbing in my ears, the sound continued to intensify until I could hear absolutely nothing else, I could feel nothing else, just fire like the burning depths of hell in which I now seemingly reside.<br /><br />My stomach started throbbing; I knew what was coming now, instead of fighting the growing nausea I just decided to just puke to get it over with and when I did that I must have blacked out from low blood pressure. While I was going out it felt as though I where falling downwards into some type of void, an endless abyss of darkness, I was sure I was going to die, then nothing. I remember coming to a moment later as the pain and nausea where beginning to recede. My face was slightly swollen and I still felt a bit drained, however as the side effects where tapering off I felt more and more energized until I reached a point where I was more energized then before I ever took the kambo. Actually I felt great, better than I have in a long time. <br />This is the afterglow that is so often reported with kambo sticks. My vision and hearing where hyper acute, I seemed to have a heightened sense of awareness and felt a paradoxical sense of calm while being energized to a degree I have never experienced before. The sun was shining bright, brighter than it’s ever been and I had a sense I could take on anything. It felt so good just to be alive. If you have ever seen the movie limitless it’s kind of like what I imagine NZT would be, I just feel...really sharp yet calm (nothing like a stimulant), not exactly like an opiate but I don’t feel the burns as bad as I did before applying it. I definitely see the medicinal effect no doubt, and despite the initial fear and pain I will be working with this one farther, it’s definitely worth the pain in every aspect.<br /><br />I don’t think you could feel this good without the pain, surely the painful effects keep it from being a drug of abuse, I feel they are necessary. It’s an ordeal, definitely not a recreational drug, don’t take this lightly. While it isn’t a psychedelic and doesn’t really seem to produce much in the way of visuals it does put your body and mind through the ringer. It’s a very heavy body load, perhaps more so than other entheogens (besides iboga).” (Source: DMtryptamines psychedelic field journals.)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Listings for Kambo (*Silk Road Addition Only)<br />SR Listing for Kambo: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4660a9f24d by: Yeshua<br />BTC: 1.93 per stick (100 dots)<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />
