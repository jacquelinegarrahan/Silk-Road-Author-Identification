				I&#039;ve seen lots of DPR quotes floating around on tumblr and other sites, and they&#039;re all refer to him as a &#039;radical libertarian&#039; and it kind of got me wondering whether most of the users on the site were also libertarians, or leaned that way.<br /><br />I&#039;m not myself, (left-leaning, a bit conservative fiscally) what about everyone else?<br /><br />I know it would be bad form to start a thread like &#039;what state do you live in?&#039; But maybe people feel comfortable enough to talk about how they lean politically. I think it&#039;s possible to get an idea of the ideological breakup of SR users without asking for any identifying info. <br /><br />Sorry I didn&#039;t cover them all or really go along a spectrum, I know there&#039;s some overlap<br /><br /><br />

I wonder if there is a correlation between using certain drugs and political leanings. Maybe people who do a lot MDMA are more likely to not give a shit or libertarians buy better quality pot.

				DPR has made me into a Libertarian leaning Anarchist. I voted for Gary Johnson last year and will probably vote the same way next time. I&#039;m not a fan of rand paul, I&#039;ve nothing specific against him or his public opinions but he&#039;s way too popular for my liking. Anyone who has that much clout in today&#039;s politics can&#039;t be a good person.

				What the Unabomber did was reprehensible. And he was wrong: Killing people to bring attention to his ideas ended up making most people lock up his ideas, along with him. They became unmentionable, for politically correct folks. Well, I would rather be correct, than politically correct. And it is time for people to read &quot;Industrial Society and its Future&quot;, by convicted serial killer Ted Kaczynski. His work, despite his deeds, deserves a place alongside Brave New World,by Aldous Huxley, and 1984?by George Orwell.

I&#039;ve read Atlas Shrugged (actually audiobook, I can&#039;t read books that fucking long) and Fountainhead (didn&#039;t care much for this one), and actually enjoyed Atlas Shrugged.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if the people who criticize Atlas Shrugged haven&#039;t even read the whole book.&nbsp; Is she right about everything in the book?&nbsp; Of course not, but what author ever is?&nbsp; Maybe I just interpreted it differently from other people.&nbsp; People rip on her &quot;don&#039;t help the weak&quot; stuff but I interpreted her writing to assert &quot;help people because you enjoy it, not because someone has guilted you into it&quot;.<br /><br />Her biggest flaw in AS / Objectivism is that she states that the government should only exist to protect people&#039;s rights, but doesn&#039;t see the glaring hole in their logic that government is funded by taxes which are coercive / involuntary and theft.&nbsp; Having someone or something violate property rights to protect rights is a pretty fucking obvious contradiction.&nbsp; And I also don&#039;t know how I feel about her writings on the topic of romance... I think she was a masochist or something.<br /><br />Voluntaryists have a joke: what&#039;s the difference between a libertarian and a voluntaryist?&nbsp; Two years.<br /><br />Government is just a big gang.
