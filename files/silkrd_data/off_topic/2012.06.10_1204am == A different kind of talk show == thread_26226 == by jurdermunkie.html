				I know I am new to SR so some might find this suspect. I have been asked over and over by doctors,counselors and everybody in between to get back out and start talking again.&nbsp; Was given an offer for 3 hour radio show. Subject matter up to me. I could do music sleeping. That Eddie Trunk guy who loves to always remind you he is &quot;friends&quot; with all these rock stars, comes across to me as &quot;I&#039;m cool cause i know these people even though they prolly only talk to me so they can plug new shit&quot;. I can out stump the trunk easily lol. Anyway after tossing around ideas i can ONLY do one thing. I want to have a show that speaks the truth from OUR side of the fence. I am so sick of these intervention shows that try to make folks think that going into &quot;treatment&quot; is a magical cure. BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!! We here on SR know it as do millions of others. Thlis could be our voice to SILENCE all those that think we are a disease on society. I have spent over last 10 yrs close to a million on drugs alone. I don&#039;t feel bad about&nbsp; it at all! I care nothing about having shittons of $$$. I made it and I spent it on what I wanted. Material things hold no value to me anymore. This show would be by NO MEANS an attempt to out anybody. I don&#039;t need names and adresses just your thoughts. You always see on those tv shows the families ambush their &quot;sick&quot; relatives. What about those of us that are ALONE?? All those shows are is an advertisement for the &quot;rehabs&quot;&nbsp; I have some interesting things about those shows that deceive you. To me the biggest pushers/dealers in the world are not the guy on the street corner but the Goverment and Billionares. They let the shit hit the streets and arrest us for using it. <br /><br />Enough said you prolly see where i&#039;m going with this. They want us to die so they can keep saying &quot;See, war on drugs is needed&quot; So taxpayers shell out more money and the &quot;Elite&quot; get richer. War not on drugs but drug users. I am no fancy sweet talker. Motive isn&#039;t greed. I want to just give YOU the chance to educate non users and users alike the Truth about the path we CHOSE&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;m ranting lol.&nbsp; Anyway get with me if interested. NoGen please come back!! LMAO i ready to feel all my veins rejoice. Praise the lord and sing the hymns of the needle freak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Please don&#039;t talk about buying drugs online. <br /><br />I really dread the day I log on facebook and see all of the idiots from my old high school going &quot;JUST M@DE MY FIRST ORDA ON SRR.. #YOLO!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not one of those people who found this place and then immediately created a thread saying we should restrict membership, I just don&#039;t think the whole country finding out overnight is going to benefit anyone.<br /><br /><br />Just plain advocating the end of prohibition would be great though, it would be nice to have something other than sensationalist bullshit crapping up the airwaves

				I say go for it man, if i got you right your just giving people the right mindset about drugs, educating people with the truth. Yeah man, but don&#039;t go all fanboy with Silk Road, like BlackEnd said we dont need promoting, all its gonna do is bring kids here, and that&#039;s the last thing we need :P.<br /><br />Good luck man,<br />Locker.

				Then I think this is a great idea. <br /><br />Drugs have been an extremely positive force in my life. It gets depressing as hell just waking up every morning and doing the same meaningless routine over and over. There is so much beauty in the world that we&#039;ve completely lost touch with. I know for a fact that if people opened their minds a little and tried a psychedelic, the world would become a 500% nicer place overnight. <br /><br />But even if that just sounds like hippy BS to most people, they should at least be able to understand that people ingest chemicals every day, and it&#039;s completely arbitrary and wrong to say which ones are okay and which ones make you deserving of being locked away in a cage. <br /><br />I think if space-faring alien civilizations ever found us, we would be the laughing stock of the universe because of this sort of shit. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26226.msg282520#msg282520">Quote from: Locker on June 10, 2012, 02:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I say go for it man, if i got you right your just giving people the right mindset about drugs, educating people with the truth.

Tbh, most of them can&#039;t keep coming here, pocket money isnt enough to get much, but that&#039;s gonna start a whole load of trouble when they start stealing their parents watches and jewelry aha.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Btw, +1 for the last 5 posts i&#039;ve seen you post, made me laugh a few times :P<br /><br />Locker.
