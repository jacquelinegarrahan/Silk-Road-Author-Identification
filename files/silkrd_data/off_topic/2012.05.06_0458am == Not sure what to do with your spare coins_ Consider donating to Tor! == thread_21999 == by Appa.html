				While installing the latest bundle, I noticed the &quot;donate&quot; section, and thought I&#039;d investigate if they took BTC.&nbsp; Their site (here: torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en) says, &quot;Instead of donating bitcoins to Tor, please consider a donation to Torservers.net, which will turn your bitcoin donation into a faster, larger Tor Network for all.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s something I think we can all agree is worth financing.&nbsp; If you have a few coins to spare, and you&#039;ve already tossed some in the wallets of the forum mods, consider donating to them to TorServers.&nbsp; Their help keep this place running.<br />More info about TorServers from their site:<br />&quot;We are a registered charitable non-profit organization based in Germany. All donations will be used in accordance to our statute to advance secure communications for the general public. If you donate more than $50 monthly, you are entitled to get your very own Tor exit node: Contact us and we&#039;ll set up a node carrying a name of your choice, with a custom info page (if desired)!&quot;<br /><br />TorServer&#039;s wallet address is:<br />19y5GzcpMyfYLpYCtKQ9Po9UjYJGoGG28c<br />(don&#039;t just take my word for it, you don&#039;t know me; proof of this address and the above information at: torservers.net/donate.html)
