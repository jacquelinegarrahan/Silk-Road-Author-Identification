				Hi guys i will be travelling to europe in like 4 months. I will not be taking any drugs with me. <br />I have never been to any european country, so I want to know the best places i could go to, i will be staying there for a couple of weeks, what are the countries that i must visit? Also is it hard to find drugs on the street ? I was thinking about using SR while i was staying there due to prices probably being cheaper than street ones, but i dont know where i will be staying, probably mostly hotels but i doubt its safe to send drugs there..<br /><br />Share your opinions and stories with me!! I want to have the best vacation ever, it will probably one of the last for me, due to commitments in real life :(.

				If you look for drugs and generally a good time, put the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal on your itinerary.<br />These countries have decriminalised cannabis consumption and Portugal has decriminalized all drugs for personal consumption.<br />if you are into festivals, plan your journey accordingly to make it to the Boom festival in Portugal. You will LOVE it.<br />

				Sounds like everyone thinks your only going places to get drugs. If thats the case amstaerdam and portugal is the place to be. But Europe is not the states. NO ONE here cares. We are very liberal regarding drugs. As long as you dont sell them. I have traveld all over europe and have never had any troble finding drugs anywhere. Just ask your local cabdriver and if he looks funny at you ask another. Again! no one cares.<br /><br />What we have in europe is a lot of historie. You really shoud check out Rom and the Vatican. Im am an atiest but that shit is way impressive. Also Paris. Go check out the mona lisa at Louvre. Se the Eiffel tower. Paris is very beautiful. Look up some festivals. We have some really greate ones. Go to south of france, Monaco, Nice and Cannes. (but bring some cash) If your into tracking or biking the alpes in austria in the summer is awesome. Copenhagen is nice for a day or two. We have a hole city with all the weed you would like. (but dont ever ask anyone for hard drugs.) I think thats it.<br /><br />Have a great trip. <br /><br />Diamonddweller.

				If you like cannabis then you should definitely try to make it to Southern Spain; good bud is like €5 per gram and the hash is about the same due to its proximity to Morocco. MDMA and E pills are also easy to come by in Spain, but you&#039;ve got to be careful of people selling straight salt and paracetamol as such! Coke is also good in Spain, better than I&#039;ve found it on the street in the US or UK at least. <br />Obviously Amsterdam should be on your list, if you&#039;re into that kind of scene. That&#039;s pretty much all I have to offer, hope you have a good TRIP (get it?? ;)<br />- JH<br />

				In summer, right? There are some amazing psy-festivals in hungary (OZORA and SUN). If you are into mountains then Switzerland is a breathtaking place. For historical sites Italy and Greece are the places to go. Into art? Most of mainland europe works, especially France and Italy. If you want to get drugs then avoid scandinavia, except Denmark. North and western europe are expensive, eastern europe cheap. Norway is probably the most expensive country (a pack of smoke for 11-12 USD, I kid you not!).<br /><br />I think most countries in Europe are interesting in different ways. It is a very large place culturally, though a small, packed place geographically. I suggest you avoid northern balkan unless you like risks ;)

				Hi !<br />I can vouch for Portugal, I love Lisbon, I have been there a few times and this is a place I would like to live in. Of course Spain is a great too, Barcelona, Valencia, Granada, Madrid, these places are wonderful.<br />The problem with Europe is that you should visit most of the major cities : Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Rome, Paris, and more ! All these towns are amazing and have their own personalities. And it goes the same for small places and countries, there is all kind of mountains or seashores, it really depends what you would like to do. <br />In my opinion you should take in consideration that the standard of living is very different depending the country, for instance Lisbon or Madrid are really less expensive than London or Paris. <br /><br />WL

				france if you can tolerate the french but not paris unless you&#039;re really into art and shit. do rome, venice, ljubljana, prague, bruges, amsterdam, haarlem, berlin, copenhagen (freetown christiania? weed/hash sold openly in weird hippyland), explore croatia and spain, you may as well check out morocco from there. go up the mountains to chefchouen if you like fresh hash. i want to go eat a kiev in kiev but i recognise that may not be a universal desire.<br />almost forgot about the uk. you can go london and smoke some cheese because it&#039;s all you&#039;ll fuckin find 80% of the time, eat a beast of a steak at the hawksmoor and then you&#039;ll be feeling super manly so watch a nice musical in the west end. there&#039;s some other stuff going on. old clocks and a wheel with pods and shit. cornwall, the lake district, even wales will be nice in the summer. newquay for surfing and a younger party vibe. pop over to ireland if you like drinking. scotland if you like deep fried food, drinking and heroin. all across the uk the towns are clones of each other. <br />or just stay in amsterdam straight up best city in europe.

				Amsterdam is definetley a great place to go but not just for the drugs, it&#039;s really well laid out, transport is real easy, it&#039;s got history, museums, parks, and practically everyone speaks English if you don&#039;t speak dutch.<br /><br />I also really recommend budapest! It has great nightclubs, it is super cheap, the best hostels, and the baths for relaxing during the day :D
