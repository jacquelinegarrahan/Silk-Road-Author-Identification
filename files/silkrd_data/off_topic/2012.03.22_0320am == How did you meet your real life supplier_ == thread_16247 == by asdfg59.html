				One I&#039;ve known since middle school and bought weed from him since 10th grade. He never gave me great prices til I helped him with a lot of things: gave him my tanning bed, helped him set someone up, did his HW for reduced prices, and eventually introduced him to connections for pharmaceuticals and even a weedman. Other guy, I had to do some scheming to get at. I had heard about him around town and seen him ballin&#039; hard. I knew two kids that he was okay friends with; so I kept buying through them even though it cost me more sot hat this connect would see i was worthwhile. Eventually he got into it with these two kids cuz they&#039;re scumbags, and I went ahead and talked to his girlfriend who worked at my&nbsp; community college and setup a meet. Prob made ~110k through this guy since I linked up with him Jan2011

				Attending university opens the door to a cornucopia of drugs. After that though you either need to keep those connects, find new ones somehow or use the old silk road.

				I&#039;ve never had a supplier in real life. I could never find the drugs I wanted in real life. The only thing anyone does is pot and other drugs that are cut like crazy. SR is my first and only supplier.

				He just kind of wandered into the place we hung out, and asked us if we knew where to get some weed. We didn&#039;t know him so we told him that we didn&#039;t, and he simply replied &quot;you do now&quot; he became one of the crew for a number of years as our sole supplier of just about anything we ever wanted. Sadly, we have all gone down different paths over the years and lost touch.

				Didn&#039;t really have one before SR. Was just an occasional &quot;friend-of-a-friend&quot; kind of idea without any real consistency. No interesting drugs to be had, either.

				I went to the city to buy a half pound of bud and it fell through, and I was so pissed I went to the gas station where I always use to shoot up dope at and sat there smoking cigarettes and across from me there was a black guy in the car who kept looking at me so I rolled down my window (this gas station I have gotten 2 free samples of dope from dealers looking for customers and met about 3 other dealers, so it is a good one lol) He asked if I wanted to buy &quot;blunt spray&quot; and walked over to me and showed me his spray that covers up weed smell after you smoke, and I told him I just wanted the stuff that goes in the blunt, and he said how much and I told him a qp (didn&#039;t want the half pound from a new guy) He said he would be back in 5 minutes and took off and was back in like 3 minutes and tossed a cheez it box in my car full of some really good almost dank bud for a cheap price.<br /><br />That was about 3 years ago and I made him probably over 100,000 dollars, he got set up lost his cars and house, and I then became his friend and got him back up to dealing again and moved in with him last Summer and helped make him even more money lol

				I know a few different people to get quantity nugget from, a good friend of mine that my brother introduced me to when they worked together a few years ago, he&#039;s been selling for awhile. Me an him would throw down on reg, then high quality shit took over and he slowly started moving up the chain, now he makes runs out to Colorado. He&#039;s a good guy, me and him have been friends for awhile. He&#039;s actually the one who got me into spinning Poi, i guess you could say he was my &#039;teacher&#039; for the first few months. <br />Another guy i met at Schwagstock, we camped next to each other and after a little bit of small talk I found out he lived in the town next to mine. He&#039;s an alright guy. <br /><br />My neighbor in the old apartment i lived in last year is a family friend with a grower about 4 hrs from where we live, so everynow n then he&#039;ll hook me up with some fucking awesome homegrown for a good price. <br /><br />When it comes to harder stuff its tough. Before me n my gf started dating, she was good friends with some guys who were bringing in reeaally good MDMA crystals and amazing LSD on WoW, I&#039;d get stuff through her and sell it back to my friends. One of those guys got arrested though and then moved away and started going heroin again, the other guy is a paranoid douche bag and cant get quality shit anymore since his supplier (the other guy) left<br /><br />Every now n then i can get cut MDxx or decent LSD through friends of friends. <br /><br /><br /><br />SR is my only option for psy&#039;s and MDMA, I havn&#039;t received my first orders yet, but we&#039;ll see how it goes!<br /><br />

				Playing Counter-strike online, I kid you not. This was the first guy I&#039;d ever bought weed off, he gave me my first ever grape blunt wrap too, for free!&nbsp; :&#039;(&lt;3<br /><br />I still remember the potent delicious smell it gave off and to this day struggle not to compare my buds to that&nbsp; forever memorable first candy, fruit smelling tasty nug.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />He went to a different high school just down the road. But ended up getting caught and expelled! The same day this happened I was waiting outside the school to pickup from him... Made the news too...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;:( ??? ::) :P :-[<br /><br /><br />These days, mainly through friends. On occasion I&#039;ll randomly meet a new source at a club or festival (dude was walking around with a 10k wad, he let me hold and smell it&nbsp; ;D) <br /><br />-at a clothes shop&nbsp; ??? -<br />Was in the city where my friend works. A guy came in and bought about 10 grand scheme weed themed items... This shit isn&#039;t cheap either. Paid my friend in crisp 100&#039;s and had about 2k in his wallet apparently.<br />He left his purchase in the store, and when came back later to get them I asked if he knew where I could get any green... The rest is history&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Silk road is working pretty darn good IRL ATM.&nbsp; ;D<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
