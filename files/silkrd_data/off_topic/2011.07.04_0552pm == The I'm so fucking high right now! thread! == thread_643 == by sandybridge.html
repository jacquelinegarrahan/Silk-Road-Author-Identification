My mom caught me injecting (inb4 underage b&amp;, I&#039;m 22, I just live at home). But hey shit happens eh? I guess I&#039;ll have to buy her a present or something... keep her sweet you know?

				&quot;Lol, are you sure it&#039;s coke and not MD? ;)&quot;<br /><br />lol, I hope it wasn&#039;t MDMA, that stuff puts holes in your brain ;) :P! Seeing as I shot the shit in me veiiins and didn&#039;t have a seizure, I&#039;m fairly certain actually! Fuck that was good coke. Jesus, I won&#039;t read my OP, even just looking at the paragraph structure it&#039;s got an inverted triangle shape, as though I was gonna finish what I was gonna say... but then never reached a fucking conclusion... then the line at the end: more coca- ... loco. I just made up the word coca-loco. @_@. Actually it&#039;s cocaloco, I DECREE THAT THIS&nbsp; NEW WORD SHALL BE UNHYPENATED!! That sentence both explained the word and was an example of it.... No wait, it didn&#039;t explain it.. but it was FUCKING example of it...<br /><br />Big props and a shoutout to all the hip gang on the SILC road! (stupid server being down) *angry*&nbsp; &gt;:( 8) if it wasn&#039;t a .onion site I would be all marchin up the the admins and be all like yo get your shit together and be online! yeah (-----reminder to sandybridge... find another SILC server...-----) <br /><br />oh and a shout out to the people of bluelight.ru. They&#039;re all like druggies. Kind of like us but they only talk about stupid shit like &quot;is codeine better than weed?&quot; and how much poppy pod tea should I stick in my arse to get a &quot;nod&quot;. yeah. But yeah ... bluelight is a pretty cool guy eh kills aliens and doesn&#039;t afraid of anything. <br /><br /><br />IF U WERE KILLED TOMORROW, I WOULDNT GO 2 UR FUNERAL CUZ ID B N JAIL 4 KILLIN DA PERSON THAT KILLED U!<br />......__________________<br />...../_==o;;;;;;;;______&#91;]<br />.....), ---.(_(__) /<br />....// (..) ), ----&quot;<br />...//___//<br />..//___//<br />WE TRUE HOMIES<br />WE RIDE TOGETHER<br />WE DIE TOGETHER<br /><br />&lt;3<br /><br />BOOYA!<br /><br />&lt;3 ;Â­)<br />
