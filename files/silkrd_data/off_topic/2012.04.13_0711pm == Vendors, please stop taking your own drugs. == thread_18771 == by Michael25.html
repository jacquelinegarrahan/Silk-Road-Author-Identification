				Why in the world is one 10mg Adderral selling for $22? Everyone is greedy, but when you are too greedy it really starts to show. I recommend ALL BUYERS to stop paying ridiculous prices for pills or the vendors will just keep increasing the price on us. We have to protect ourselves here. Sorry but a REALISTIC price for one 10mg Adderral is $10. The most, $12. NOT $22. I&#039;m not trying to take down vendors, or give them a hard time, I&#039;m trying to keep them in check and to stop taking advantage of overly excited buyers. This is just one example. I see many more things on SR that are WAY over priced. Just trying to help.<br /><br />

				Are you looking at the bottom of the list? Cause I looked up adderall earlier today and found this one which I think is a pretty good price considering it gets shipped to your door. (not endorsing this specific vendor I am simply linking the best priced single adderall I found)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b3b604af60

				I&#039;m a vendor and I&#039;d like to respond. I try to keep my prices pretty low. However, with having to pay the high commission to SR and all of the packaging supplies, it does force me to raise my prices. I will say though, that I&#039;ve seen other vendors that sell the same product that I do, sell for $2-6 more. I agree with you that if prices are getting too high then buyers should not pay them.

				That&#039;s precisely it, isn&#039;t it? If buyers refuse to pay unreasonable prices, then vendors are forced to keep their pricing honest. A commodity is only ever worth what someone is willing to pay for it.<br /><br />-sSh-

				recently seen a vendor selling some very familar pills that are not native to US.<br />reason being I used to buy these from the source and know at least 90% that the guy I was dealing with was the only that had these. <br />want go into details cause I&#039;m not one to throw salt into someones game. Hell I thought about doing the same thing but after further considering( after I seen some of the med prices)<br />decided it wasnt worth my time as I can make far more money with what I do w/out all the hassle.<br /><br />but the point here is:<br />I get same meds from source for $.75 to $1.25 a pc depending which med ( local retail is $2 to $8 a pc)<br />&nbsp;SR vendor is selling them for $6-$8 a pc<br />not bad profit if they manage to keep supplied<br /><br />hell it might be the source on here selling now:)<br /><br />but its supply and demand and what someones willing to pay.<br />and just like any other businesses they have to consider overhead/risk/ desired profit to make it worth the time,&nbsp; and energy.<br /><br />if you dont agree with price, dont buy.... that simple

I enjoy stimulants on occasion, but I&#039;ve only dabbled in coke and various pharmaceutical uppers. Is there a way to take a very low dose of meth (maybe orally...?) and get only moderate, amphetamine-salt type effects without the stereotypical mania/binging/psychosis that you always see on TV and shit? I&#039;m guessing it can be done, but is that what you go for usually or is it just an entirely different experience with meth?<br /><br /><br />

I&#039;d say it can make you chatty, give you some focus (or, in my case, makes me focus intensely on lots of things in quick succession), makes you tap your fingers and toes, gives you an urge to chain smoke, puts a little knot in your stomach--or at least makes food seem completely unappetizing, and will keep you up for a while. There is sometimes a slight euphoria, but nothing major (for me at least). I&#039;ve found it useful for doing mundane chores or monotonous work for long periods of time. It helps give you a boost of motivation, basically. I&#039;ve used it purely recreationally plenty of times, but only because it&#039;s been very accessible. When it comes to having a good time, I&#039;d much prefer the 150mg of MDMA/60mg of morphine/1.5g of weed/a few grams of shrooms/or basically whatever else $22 could get you on SR. That being said, I&#039;m also one of those weird people that thinks coke is a bit overrated for the price (still fun, though! Or maybe I&#039;ve never had top quality shit), so maybe uppers just aren&#039;t really my thing? Your mileage definitely may vary. <br /><br />I think 20mg of Adderall is worth about $5-10 or so. Obviously people are willing to pay much more than that and SR fees/convenience means it&#039;s reasonable for vendors to charge more, but I&#039;m just saying for me, personally, it&#039;s only maybe $.50/mg worth of fun and usefulness, all things considered. <br /><br />

				The price for the 10mg Vicodin&#039;s are ridiculous as well. I don&#039;t buy them though, so doesn&#039;t bother me.<br /><br />Typing this made me realize well hell, i can get those same pills for 8 bucks a pop here. I should just buy them and sell them on here for like a dollar cheaper lol. And just have the competition lower the price down.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even mess with those, i use heroin. But seeing them the price that they are really concerns me.

I personally use it when I have a lot of work to be done and need to focus 100% and honestly all you need is 10-15mg for it to hit so I usually buy 30mg pills and split them in half,&nbsp; ultimately doubling my supply. I can&#039;t really see anyone using these in a non-working environment like at a rave or party, I would rather do MDMA or some type of psych. <br /><br />

				I do understand markets. High demand, prices rise. But the point I was trying to get across was to hint to the buyers to stop purchasing for a while or don&#039;t take those hikes like that. The buyer to some extent is in control. I bought some adderral from someone here, prices were fair, but now they almost tripled so now I&#039;m not a customer. There is AWLAYS someone selling something for less. Hell, even makes me want to be a vendor here. I&#039;m not real greedy and would keep prices fair. Not out to get rich. It is just too bad they have to raise their prices, that&#039;s all.<br /><br />

				lol I have a lot of friends with adderal prescriptions. I normally just trade them like $10 for 3 pills 25mg each i think their filled with orange dots. I should probly start selling them on sr. They make me feel really relaxed like weed relaxed but without feeling stoned if that makes sense?
