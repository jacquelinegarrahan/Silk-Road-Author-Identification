				I used to be a HUGE opiate fan but after being on Percs for over a year and finally getting off of them about 6 months ago because of shoulder/neck problems I just don&#039;t really care about them anymore.&nbsp; <br />Fave drug right now, MXE.&nbsp; A great mix of dissociative and psychedelic.&nbsp; Although I do have a Dilaudid coming to me and I&#039;m pretty excited about that!

I have adhd and a few years back my psychiatrist put me on vyvanse. I had non stop euphoric energy for a couple weeks. Then it just teetered off and I had to up my dosage. I waned myself off as soon as I started having irregular heart palpations.<br /><br />I&#039;m a cannabis kind of guy. Always have been, since the young age of 11, and find when used in moderation it works wonders for me. It raises my awareness, makes me more creative, enjoyable to be around, and makes me conscious of things I may have taken for granted while sober. I can have some extremely intense psychedelic trips with edibles, and that puts psychedelics second on my list.

				I really like cannabis too but it&#039;s not my favorite because it makes me feel slower and sleepier, and I feel like I&#039;ve wasted time. I do like a nice bowl after a long day of work, to help me relax and feel happier and get to sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cannabis is also a good social drug, something I&#039;d take at a party to help conversation or feel more connected. <br /><br />Tripping for me is an actual experience.&nbsp; Something I would devote a Saturday to.&nbsp; If I smoked weed and watched tv and played video games all afternoon I&#039;d feel lazy but if I spend an afternoon tripping and going for a walk I feel really satisfied.&nbsp; Of course you can smoke and go for a walk but it&#039;s not as &#039;magical&#039; I guess.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps that&#039;s just because there is so much weed use around me that I&#039;ve gotten used to it.&nbsp; Psychedelics, almost like stimulants, make me feel so invigorated and alive and make the world seem so brilliant. For this reason I really like 2-C&#039;s and of course acid, as well as 25I-NBOME.&nbsp; Shrooms are a lot of fun too but I feel like my experiences tend to be more introspective, which is nice but not always what I want.

				Was anyone else really surprised at the results?&nbsp; I was sure Cannabis would be number one.&nbsp; I only assumed that since it was my choice.&nbsp; I guess that shows that I project my feelings on others.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Really surprised.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its like when Santorum wins a state and I can&#039;t figure out why.&nbsp; I guess I have to stop assuming that people share my taste.

				I&#039;m so biased to psychedelics because I never had a blast taking them.&nbsp; DMT was very strange and too short for me, and mushrooms have always made me vomit, or I&#039;ve never taken enough.&nbsp; &nbsp;Never could find a solid source of lsd.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been curious, but never too enthused.<br /><br />But hands down, Mdma will always have a soft spot in my heart (synapse..)
