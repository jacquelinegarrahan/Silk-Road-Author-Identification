				How does the bit on your hands correlate with the bit stuck in your throat? ??? Also have you tried vomiting? That would probably clear your throat pretty well. :P

				I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s possible. The inside of your esophagus is lined with mucous membrane which is constantly producing mucous so any particles that might become entangled in the mucous will eventually &quot;grow out&quot;. Furthermore a piece of bud is sticky because of the oily resins and the mucous inside your esophagus is water-based so I don&#039;t think that pieces of bud get entangled in the first place. I regularly chew and swallow small amounts of bud to test them for the presence of adulterants and I never have such problems :)

				I think he must mean he inhaled some while smoking.<br /><br />2 possible outcomes.<br /><br />1. nothing happens, eventually it gets cleared and you forget about it.<br />2. it causes you to develop an infection in your lungs and you die.<br /><br />Ok,&nbsp; #2 I just made up.<br /><br />I guess it also could have been a seed. If so a weed plant may grow inside you, which would be awesome.
