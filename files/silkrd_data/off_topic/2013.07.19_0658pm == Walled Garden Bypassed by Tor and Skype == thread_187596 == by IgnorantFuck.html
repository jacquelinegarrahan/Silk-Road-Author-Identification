				So, right now my internet is out due to not paying the bill (to be fair it isn&#039;t my bill to pay), but I can still connect to the internet through Tor and through Skype. (I can&#039;t, however, play any online games and I&#039;m starting to go through withdrawls. e.e)<br /><br />Can anyone explain this phenomenon, and/or help me set up my computer to run everything through tor before going onto the internet or something? It&#039;d be great if I could just have free internet.

				When your Internet service gets shut off, they don&#039;t do it like cable where they actually send someone out to unlock the box and connect the cables. It&#039;s possible that they&#039;re just screwing with you through their DNS server. It&#039;s also possible that they&#039;re just really dumb and are only blocking port 80 (which is for HyperText Transfer Protocol, eg HTTP, eg clearweb). Tor connects through a different port entirely, and I believe it can be changed in settings. Skype also connects through a different port. I don&#039;t know, though, since you said you couldn&#039;t play online games - are you talking about, say, Steam or something, or just browser games?

				I can&#039;t play team fortress two, maplestory, or league of legends. I may or may not be able to play minecraft but I&#039;m not really sure.
