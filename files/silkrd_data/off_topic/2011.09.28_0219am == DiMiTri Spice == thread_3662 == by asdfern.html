				He sold on here until very recently. I heard that he got inundated with orders and pulled his listings because he was too busy. Not really sure exactly what happened or if he&#039;s coming back. I am kind of bummed as I wanted to try his product. I hope he comes back soon.

				I was in contact with him a few days ago, but he said he was sorting out his delivery problems. Gave me a full refund, and offer to send out the product when he gets his problem solved (since I ordered weeks ago).&nbsp; Good vendor, will definitely do more business with him whenever he comes back.
