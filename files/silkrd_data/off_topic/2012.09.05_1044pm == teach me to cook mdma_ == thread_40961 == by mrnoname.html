				If you are determined to learn to cook, do yourself a favor and take some chemistry courses first. It would help to understand what the fuck you&#039;re doing instead of just performing a list of tasks. Why do certain things react the way they do, and what steps are dangerous/may create toxic gases/etc.<br /><br />In any case, just Google &quot;bright star MDMA.&quot; I would do it from another computer, though. Can&#039;t be too careful.<br /><br />Edit: You might also run into some trouble obtaining precursor. I can&#039;t give any specific recommendations, though I&#039;m sure you can find what you&#039;re looking for somewhere accessible by Tor (perhaps even on the &#039;Road).

				okay my post obviously did seem &quot;noobish&quot; but i just rushed it, i understand how it can make someone mad im not trying to just pretend that a drug is a cake at home so i dont blame you for bashing on me but i put a lot of time into researching uncle fester and dr schulgan im sorry for incorrectly spelling him name and i did not wanted to be taking for so foolish but i already have a general education of chemistry and understand the distillation process and how everything is more intricate than it seems yet again im sorry to come off idiodic, but some precursors are highly watched and can not be distilled. and if you guys do know anything you would know making a clean synth is pretty hard with old school teks considering yes the government had caught on i was just wondering if they are ways around some things. i dident make to look&nbsp; like an idiot but now that i re read what i post i did rush it i just thought if i had mentioned uncle fester and a chemical love story some of you would know ive done my research and bright stars tek is great but i guess i got my answers and comes down to nobody can cook it unless the rare as fuck and expensive precursors were in their possesion.<br /><br />sorry guys :/

				Even after the post &quot;war-is-over&quot; phase of the early 2000&#039;s it remains possible to synthesise MDMA using only precursors that can be bought without resorting to actual chemical suppliers. Obtaining the proper equipment can also be done in most of the western world, but doing so without being apprehended as a result of monitoring presents more challenges than ten years ago. It also remains possible to fabricate the equipment, given the right tooling and equipment, as well as the necessary metallurgical knowledge.<br />&nbsp; Doing so is quite a challenge, and requires that you build up knowledge and skill in a number of disciplines. Laboratory technique must be learned, like any skill, so that a proper understanding of the theory informs the repetitions of each process required to become proficient in each of the required procedures.<br />&nbsp; It is possible to effectively synthesise MDMA and other phenethylamines without a great deal of theoretical organic chemistry knowledge, although you will need to understand and be able to perform a number of specific reaction types. However, without the requisite background knowledge the qualitative analysis you&#039;ll have to perform before even considering consuming a chemical you&#039;ve synthesised doing so would be likely to result i injury to you any anyone you were careless enough to dose with your product.<br /><br />I&#039;d humbly suggest you read and heed Addy&#039;s post. There is no &quot;recipe&quot;, for this is not cooking, but there are a number of syntheses, and starting with Addy&#039;s recommendation will give you a chance to at least find a suitable set of resources aimed at clandestine production of MDMA. Forget Fester&#039;s works. They&#039;re rubbish, by and large, and do more harm than good. Sasha Shulgin - to whom I&#039;m very grateful - has an excellent body of published work, but it is aimed at organic chemists and not at the layperson, and there are many assumptions not explained in the procedures which are obvious to an organic chemist.<br /><br />Understand that a lot of the literature aimed at the budding clandestine chemist was written some years ago, and sourcing precursors is a very different game these days. Nevertheless, it&#039;s still possible to source the most restricted precursors without suspicion, but in many cases with a fair bit of work.<br /><br />Perhaps you ought to consider reading Total Synthesis. It&#039;s not filled with solutions for today, but it will perhaps help you bootstrap your understanding of required concepts to the level that you&#039;re able to understand some of the more sophisticated and refined syntheses that came after TS was published.<br /><br />Reading your posts, I feel it&#039;s unlikely you&#039;re currently the type of person with the dedication and perseverance required to take you from your current desire to the desire outcome. It simply might not be a good idea for you to pursue this line of enquiry beyond the theoretical.

				dont let these pricks stop you from cooking dope! :P<br />i agree with them that you are not ready. you dont have to use their lingo per se. cook it bake it wtf ever you wanna call it. but study and ask more specific questions about a route that best accommodates your situation (labware, precursors etc.)&nbsp; <br />IMO you need to read&nbsp; your ass off for at least 6 months before you are ready to even look at lab equipment for this procedure. i recommend doing caffeine extractions and easy things as a basis.&nbsp; there are many sites for this. dont be lazy. dont rush it. <br />look up wetdreams&nbsp; and the collective forums.. they have some really valuable information ....someone already recommended &quot;BRightstar&quot; writeup or recipe LOL....&nbsp; which as adamn good one. easiest to do and precursors are about the easiest to get.... <br />sassafrass and other essential oils are a bitch your yields will suck.. but what the hay good luck.. look on youtube and do some of the basic refluxes and simpler things before you jump head first into this ...<br />

If you&#039;ve produced your ketone precursor it&#039;s not any more difficult to synthesise methylamine and hydroxylamine, and reductively aminate from there to give MDMA or MDA respectively. The weights are slightly different due to the difference in molecular weight between methylamine and hydroxylamine but the amination runs remarkably similar either way.

				My vendor name on SR is &quot;ron paul&quot;.&nbsp; I am the one selling guides on mda, mdma and ergotamine production, as well as the relevant sources.&nbsp; These reactions aren&#039;t rocket-science, you dont have to be a chef to learn to cook one awesome meal.&nbsp; There are safety and legal concerns but in what aspect of life is this a game-ender?<br /><br />My guides are legit, from firsthand knowledge.&nbsp; Everyone has been super happy with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you buy a guide I will answer your synthesis questions, even though that&#039;s not really what I advertise.&nbsp; Any of you guys interested you can talk to me.&nbsp; If anyone wants to hate, put your money where your mouth is and lets talk synthesis.&nbsp; You explain a process you are interested in and I will explain where you are gona fuck up, and save you money for free.
