				Hi there,<br /><br />I am just interested why meth is so much more expensive than speed? Is it harder to cook or is it more potent?<br /><br />Cheers!

				It&#039;s about twice as potent and lasts nearly twice as long. It&#039;s a more intense high too. It is also more toxic and addictive. <br /><br />Why do Europeans mostly sell speed while Americans mainly sell meth? Is it for social reasons since meth is looked at as being a dirty, evil drug or is it because of the availability of chemicals to make it? <br /><br />Meth is actually much cheaper than prescription speed like Adderall.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m curious how meth compares in effect to adderall if you&#039;d care to shed some light on this. I believe the difference between products in Europe and the US is mainly due to availability of required ingredients but I am not certain.

				Where I am from, I can only get crystal meth which is of a really high purity. It cost&#039;s about $20 if I have to convert it from my currency to $, this is for 500mg of CLEAN,CLEAR CRYSTAL SHARDS LIKE GLASS. No powder or any funky smells or tastes.<br /><br />I can only get Amphetamine paste here on SR but when I convert the price from my currency to BTC for a bag of 1 gram of very decent 50% pure speed paste, it costs me about $15 including shipping and all.<br /><br />So I pay $5 more for half a gram of methamphetamine compared to 1g of amphetamine which cost&#039;s $5 less...<br /><br />I prefer amphetamine as meth makes me too serious and lasts too long. I get more euphoria from amphetamine than methamphetamine.

				Meth is $75 per 500mg here and that&#039;s still far cheaper than prescription stimulants per mg. Adderall is 4 to 6 times as expensive. <br /><br />I don&#039;t take them the same way or at the same doses so it&#039;s kind of hard to compare effects. I take Adderall mainly by mouth with a little snorted here and there whereas I mostly snort and occasionally IV meth.
