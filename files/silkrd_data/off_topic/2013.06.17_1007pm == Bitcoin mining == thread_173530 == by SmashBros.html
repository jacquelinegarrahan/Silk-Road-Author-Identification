				I did attempt to do some bitcion mining but as i don&#039;t have a proper mining rig it just wasn&#039;t worth it!! Couldn&#039;t afford a mining rig but I&#039;m told that they do pay for them self quite quickly.

The jump from 19 to 110 was a market correction to the currency&#039;s true $usd value. 110 to 280 was from the speculators cashing out of US/Euro into digital gold. The big drops in value were traditionally from early adopters cashing out and more recently hackers bringing down the infrastructure. As more and more currency stays in circulation the currency will become more stable. I believe bitcoin has at least a 10-20 year life left!<br /><br />My question: Is bitcoin considered a fiat currency? or as stated, simply a crypto currency.

				That&#039;s interesting about the mining rigs. I&#039;ve seen they typically go for a good price and are very popular. I would imagine the profitability varies with how difficult they make it to get the right number of leading zeros, and of course with the value of the BTC.<br /><br />The BTC I would think is considered a fiat; I mean, it is not backed by anything physical such as gold or silver is it?<br /><br />You can definitely see the manipulation in the market. When there are big price swings, there is also heavy volume. I&#039;m guessing there are group(s) of people banded together, where you must have a certain amount of BTC available to join in, then on certain intervals they sell heavily to push the price down, then immediately buy on the lower price and make a fairly fast, easy profit. The more BTC in circulation the harder that will be to do but it&#039;s not really much different than other markets.

				I mined 0.01 BTC through 50BTC. Made ~0.05 BTC through Satoshi Dice, then lost it to Satoshi Dice. That took me 3 days to mine, 7 days to gamble, and one click to lose it all. Happy to say that&#039;s all I&#039;ve lost to Satoshi Dice. I&#039;d rather do drugs than gamble anyway.

Fiat currency is that put out by governments, which is controlled by governments and central bankers and their crony banksters. Also, prone to massive expansion via money printing and quantitative easing which leads to devaluation and eventual (one hopes) collapse. Bitcoin has none of these characteristics, it&#039;s truly an anti-central planning currency, and cannot, by design, be overcreated and lead to devaluation, unless that is accomplished by speculators. If anything, the only direction for it to go is up, in the long run.<br /><br />goblin

				I also believe that BTC is not a fiat.&nbsp; &nbsp;It does have a representable value in gold/silver/drugs and it is backed by these things, in a federated network of producers/buyers/sellers that will trade any number of stored goods for control of more contracts.&nbsp; Until BTC can be counterfeited or printed irresponsibly it is something wildly different.

				There&#039;s a wealth of knowledge on bitcointalk.org, but it is a forum, so there is a lot of reading to catch up on the scene.<br /><br />Avalon chips from China are a good way to go if you can assemble/manufacture boards (pcb). There are a few people in the works for assemblying K16 boards, which seem promising, but no final word yet. BFL have basically made millions without actually fulfilling orders. TerraHash is another up-and-comer. Personally, I am looking at KnCMiner.com, a Swedish company. They make a Saturn and Jupiter at 200 and 400 Gh/s at 3,795$ and 6,995$, respectively. Shipping begins in September. They accept bitcoin (bitpay), paypal, and bank transfer.<br /><br />I was going to play around building a few K16 boards, since material costs for the board assembly before the Avalon chips is less than $50, most of the parts coming from Mouser.<br /><br />Cheers.
