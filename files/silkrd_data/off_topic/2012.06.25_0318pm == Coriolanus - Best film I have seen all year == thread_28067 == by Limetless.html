				Anyone else seen this?<br /><br />Have to say it&#039;s without a shadow of a doubt this is one of the best films I have seen all year. Anyone else seen this gem? Ralph Fiennes is fucking A in it and does a sterling job at directing it as well. <br /><br />What is really good is that if you like Shakespeare then you wont see this as a bad version either. Kick ass film from start to finish!<br /><br />In fact stop what you are doing and go watch it. Now.

				i saw it 2 times and I think itÂ´s a pretty good film. <br />no really a Shakespeare fan but this one is different. I can relate too much to the story on&nbsp; a personal basis.

				u need to have some level of life experiences and knowledge to get something positive out of the film.<br />Of course your step daughter is more interested in fake mind controlling films like harry potter. &quot; J.K. Rowlling&quot; (or whatever) writes like few people do that is the cause of her success amongst children.

				Yeah too right! It&#039;s fucking depressing if you ask me.

I don&#039;t blame kids for buying shit like that because at the end of the day kids follow trends and you ain&#039;t always with them when they buy clothes but when ya clock that shit it&#039;s a case of in the bin you go. Early sexualisation is damaging to a child&#039;s mind, kids should be kids while they can be kids. Fucking long time grown up and I know I wish I was 10 again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It would certainly be easier to be a kid again! :-D<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damn straight, I often speculate if I could do it all again would I end up in the same place? I suppose we all do but I have been doing it a lot of late.

				To continue to derail the thread, I have a baby girl and I had this plan to have her watch kids shows that I watched when I was a kid, I downloaded or bought DVD&#039;s of Tale Spin, Chippendale Rescue Rangers, Flintstones, Duck Tales, Denver the Last Dinosaur, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Rugrats, Doug, etc.<br /><br />My idea, formed when I was high of course, was that when you talk with your friends and shit and reminisce you talk about old tv shows/movies/games that older or younger generations don&#039;t know of. So in our digital age we have the advantage of being able to expose our kids to the same media instead of the junk they have for them today. I was going to go as far as introduce her to a Nintendo game system first, and then next Christmas get her a Super Nintendo and so on.<br /><br />I found that even shows still around today, like Sesame Street, have changed a ton since when I was a kid. Some of the episodes has Big Bird rapping, and they&#039;re constantly trying to fill they&#039;re heads with Spanish on most of the new kids shows now days in the US. I understand it&#039;s easier to learn the core of a new language at an early age, but I have no interest in my daughter learning Spanish unless she wants to. I don&#039;t want a culture, one that I have 0 interest in, to be pushed onto my children. I&#039;d rather them learn a useful language, like Mandarin Chinese or Canadian.
