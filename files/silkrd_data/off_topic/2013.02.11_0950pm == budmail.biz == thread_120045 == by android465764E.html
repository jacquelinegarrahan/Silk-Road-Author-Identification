				Let me tell you a story.<br /><br />I can&#039;t exactly talk about MoM on twitter, so it goes in here instead. lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m basically sound-boarding, bitching, moaning, whining etc.. about the god-awful service I have received from budmail.biz <br /><br />The shitty experience I received from them was part of my incentive for searching out other sources, and joining SilkRoad.&nbsp; <br /><br />Budmail are a Canadian outfit. <br />I am in the UK. <br />They sell weed, mushrooms, hash, oil and budder.<br /><br /><br />On December the 3rd last year, I placed an order for a half ounce of cheap greenhouse weed.<br />My order status was marked as &quot;received, waiting for payment&quot;. <br />They only accept Liberty Reserve, which was a pain in the arse to get from the uk. Exchangers etc... But, in about 48hrs I had paid for my order.<br />The status changed to &quot;payment received - thank you!&quot; <br /><br />Now, for ten days, nothing happened. My order wasn&#039;t shipped, and the helpdesk didn&#039;t reply to any of my polite enquiries.<br /><br />Then, on Dec17th, they closed for Xmas.<br />They re-opened on Jan 3rd.<br /><br />I check my account, and it says, &quot;order cancelled, please re-submit under our new system&quot;. They sent me a voucher code for the amount I&#039;d spent, and so I re-submitted, and had to go through the whole process again. ffs.<br /><br />THEN, they closed again, to implement a &quot;new strain reservation system&quot;. Ten days later, I had to AGAIN, re-submit, with a other voucher code.<br /><br />My order was finally dispatched three days ago.<br /><br />So, between December the 3rd and Feb 8th, over two months, I had to re-submit an order two times, and my order is now apparently &quot;in transit&quot;. <br /><br />They still do not answer my polite enquiries.<br /><br /><br />As you can tell, I am a very disgruntled &#039;customer&#039;. <br />I will never use them again. Ever.<br />And I suggest that if anyone from the UK is considering using them - don&#039;t. <br /><br />SR on the other hand... <br /><br />Order drugs on Monday, I&#039;m high on Tuesday.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Right, rant over.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are a few customers from budmail who will jump all over this thread, but I don&#039;t give a toss.<br /><br />Budmail are shit, and are the very epitome of bad customer service.<br /><br /><br />Viva la SR. <br /><br /><br />

				yer they were my first MOM experience also in the uk and i had 10 or so orders show up fine. i stopped using them because they shut me out of the forums because i was an international customer. apparently a lot of people were complaining about late or missing orders on there and that was their solution. blanket silence. after that they can go fuck themselves really. plus LR really did become a pain in the arse to get hold of after mx gox wouldnt let you withdraw in LR. and that ground up weed just doesn&#039;t look great although i did hear they changed methods since then.
