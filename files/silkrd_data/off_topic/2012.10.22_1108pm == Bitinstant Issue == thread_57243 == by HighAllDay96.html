				I&#039;m trying to transfer from Major Bank Branch to a Bitcoin Address. Every time I try to complete a transaction it gives me this error. <br /><br />&quot;We are sorry but we are unable to accept this transaction at present. Please double check your transaction amount is within limits or try again later.<br /><br />Contact support if you have any queries.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve searched around and I&#039;ve checked to make sure there&#039;s not an extra space at the end of the Bitcoin Address etc. Could it just be that Bitinstant is being a little faulty today? Or maybe I&#039;m not doing something else correct? I&#039;m just trying to get Bitcoins to SR successfully as quick as possible.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />HighAllDay96

				You didn&#039;t say - are you over the transfer limits?&nbsp; Might want to look at that - it&#039;s what the error alludes to... I would assume that you have checked this though - in that case, maybe jump on IRC and talk to the Bitinstant crew - they helped me out quite well once that way.
