				Hey I have a real life hookup for LSD tabs hopefully this sort of thing is appropriate.

				So you need a human test subject to administer noxious substances too?<br /><br />&nbsp;Id be suspicious that they are really 25i NBOME.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to tell by the bitter taste.&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact , LSD is oudorless and tasteless. <br />&nbsp;So if there is any adulterants:<br />- you will taste them<br />- adulterants would have to be active at microgram amounts <br />- yu would notice the effects are different from LSD<br /><br />A good scientist uses himself as the first test subject as a demonstration of their faith in their skills and ability.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I thought yu were a vendor with LSD from a real life hookup.&nbsp; <br />Ya, you should need a vending permit to be fair to others.&nbsp; Also, like Ron says safety and quality control. It&#039;s nice to be able to track down a vendor if its bad shit ya know.&nbsp; It could save lives.

				Go to dance safe and buy your self a test kit.. The Marquis kit turns PITCH black when used on LSD .. you will get colors if it is another substance.. They send you a little card with the kit to tell you what each color means.. I have this kit and use it all the time. <br /><br />How ever if you wish to find out just how strong they are you will need someone in the EU to take them in for testing.. I think its about $150 to run the test but don&#039;t quote me on that..&nbsp; &nbsp;
