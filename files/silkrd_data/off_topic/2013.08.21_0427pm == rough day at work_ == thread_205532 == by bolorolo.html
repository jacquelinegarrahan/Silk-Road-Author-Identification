				I know what you mean! Sometime they happen out of nothing like last week I was stressed out by a work colleague who kept going on about something that might happen when we move office and at the end of the day it had nothing to do with his area of work at all I ended up telling him it was none of his business and more or less to shut up after going over and over it all week! <br /><br />I don&#039;t have a way to escape it but maybe that&#039;s why I hit the drink that Friday because he stressed me all week when really I wanted a quite weekend without drugs or drink!<br /><br />I sometimes get out and go for a walk on my own without telling anyone to get away from the office and co-workers. Maybe you could try that to replace xanax or was that just a once off?<br /><br />I take a xanax to get me asleep after coke and it&#039;s only new to me but I found I was drowsy all day the next day and could hardly keep my eyes open!

				Oh man, reading what you went through makes me feel better, and its crazy how similar worklife stressors can be, i swear im going through something so similar to you its scary haha<br /><br />the xanax was definitely a one off thing, im a lady so it might be &#039;that time of the month&#039; but i could feel myself getting fiery and worked up and made the xanny decision. it worked out for today as i am much more calm but for sure dont want to make it a habit<br /><br />going to have to start going on walks to clear my head, thanks for reading! all it takes is some venting sometimes to make the day go by :)<br /><br />

				I started doing coke today in work for the 1st time - &quot;just one line&quot;, the usual trick your own mind can do on you when it comes to coke. Now that is definitely something I don&#039;t want to make a habit of and have to make sure it was a one off thing! <br /><br />Nothing to do with negativity or being busy but it just came into my head so I went for it because I had it with me.<br /><br />No more coke at work for me and hopefully no more xanax for you!&nbsp; ;) Think positive yourself and let others get negative if they want to but try not let their negativity affect you!!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				There have been a few times when I&#039;d have to work longer than normal (gotta come in three hours earlier than usual) and I would take some methadone before heading in and, although it&#039;d make me really drowsy after lunchtime, it was such a nice pick-me-up/destresser because things would be hectic on the outside but I could just look inwards and feel how warm and fuzzy and okay I felt on the inside and it really helped me deal with things better. I definitely think it can help someone&#039;s focus and attitude at work. :) Too bad not everybody see it that way.
