				Hi fellow SR members. I need some advice. I&#039;ve been looking everywhere for a good Cannabutter recipe to make some actual hash brownies from some of HF&#039;s bubble hash. I know the average rule of thumb is every 1lb of butter (4 sticks) to every 1oz of bud. I wanna use hash tho, so I guess 1/2oz of hash to every 1lb of bud? Just curious if anyone knows of a good amount of hash that works for them when making cannabutter? Thanks!

I use three grams of standard-quality Moroccan hash for about 125 Grams (half a block) of butter so I think 1/8 of hash for a stick of butter is about right. So yeah, you got it exactly right! You might want to consider using more butter (~50% should do) if you have high-grade hash. If you have any more questions, I&#039;m here :)

				Will definitely give it a try! Thanks! How potent do your brownies usually turn out with that recipe?

That way, I can enjoy the aroma of the hash which is fucking amazing. I&#039;ve had a few cannabis-infused brownies/slices of cake that my friends made using my butter recipe and all of them had zero cannabis taste so that&#039;s not my preferred use for the butter. I have no exact info on hash content of those brownies/cakes but they did work nicely, even when second-/third-grade Moroccan hash was used.<br />Me and a buddy once made 125g of butter with 3g of premium quality hash that we got from a dutch coffee shop for 16â‚¬ per gram and we each had 1.5 tablespoons of butter in our hot chocolate and we were stoned to a point where any newbie would have freaked out for sure. And the peak lasted like five hours!<br />Note that when I say tablespoons, I&#039;m not talking about the unit of measurement but actual tablespoons.

				Update:<br />I used 3.5 grams of HF&#039;s bubble hash<br />with one stick of butter. Only let it simmer for about 20 mins tops (wish I would&#039;ve let it sit longer) <br />Brownies turned out nice. Can slightly taste the weed but it&#039;s not an issue for me. Half way thru my second one now. I&#039;m new to edibles so hopefully these will get me baked as I&#039;m sure they will. <br /><br />So if you wanna make actual hash brownies I&#039;d say about an 8th to every stick of butter will do you justice. <br />Thanks Ballzinator for the help! If I would&#039;ve seen your post about the hot chocolate earlier I would&#039;ve given it a try.
