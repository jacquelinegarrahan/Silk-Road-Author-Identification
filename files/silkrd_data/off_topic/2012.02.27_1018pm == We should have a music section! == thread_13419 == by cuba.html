				I personally believe there should be a small portion of the board dedicated to music, hell with such a big mdma market, and lsd intrest there has to be some unique tastes of music and cool finds people wanna share right?<br /><br />what do you guys think

				I don&#039;t know if being identified based on music preference is totally out of the question. Probably not the best idea given the unorthodoxy of Silk Roads music taste.

				My fave drug is MXE and music is a MUST when I trip.&nbsp; It adds so much.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that it has to be beatless.&nbsp; For some reason anything with a beat really fucks with my trip.&nbsp; &nbsp;Minimal/Ambient/Drone.&nbsp;

				They should have this.<br />And whenever I&#039;m sober I listen to Top 40s, but when I&#039;m tripping Yonkers, DJ Ephixa, or the underground Scandinavian Club Music on YouTube are awesome.

				About a month ago, I went to the cinema to view a one-off screening of The Chemical Brothers&#039; concert movie &#039;Don&#039;t Think&#039;.<br /><br />It was seriously mind-blowing and revived my interest in 90&#039;s electro music. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t help but think &quot;Damn, this music was just made for tripping on LSD!&quot;<br /><br />After being out of the loop for a few years and no longer having any drug connections, my curiosity and a few online searches led me to SR.<br /><br />Hence the username, after a Chemical Brothers&#039; song. :)

				I think instead of a music section we should have several boards dedicated to specific drugs. Like how on the Silk Road there are categories for each drug type, then subcategories, there could be some boards dedicated to a broad category (e.g. stimulants, psychadelics, ect.) then inside each board some of us can make threads dedicated to our drugs of choice and their use, or anything related to the use of them (like a music thread in the MDMA board). Idk, maybe it&#039;s too much work and it could end up being a big mess.
