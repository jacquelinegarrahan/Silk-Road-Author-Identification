				I&#039;m new to all of this. Forgive me if I&#039;ve breached any etiquette as I haven&#039;t taken a lot of time to figure out the nuances of the deep web. <br /><br />As the subject implies I need a friend/friends. A person/people that&#039;s a good listener, non-judgemental, has real life experience, and is understanding. For at least a while I&#039;ll admit that it&#039;ll be a pretty one-sided relationship as I feel so lost and trapped right now.&nbsp; A regular therapist isn&#039;t going to cut it for me right now. I&#039;m in a pretty tough situation and I just can&#039;t let any of my weaknesses cost me. I have a lot hanging in the balance. Long story short I&#039;m a drug dealer and I&#039;m on the run from the law right now. No its not anything major I&#039;m on the run for and you won&#039;t see my name in any wanted posters and I doubt that the police are even aware of my activity or if they are I strongly doubt they have any indictments as I&#039;m fairly cautious. This could be a good opportunity for someone who might be interested in helping people long-term. I&#039;m not a bad guy, I&#039;m not a saint but I&#039;ve never spilled any blood. I&#039;ve fought but never with weapons. I&#039;m not the type to rationalize I know the gravity of my actions and the consequences that could follow. But now more than ever its either this or nothing, and I choose this. I&#039;m surrounded by people that don&#039;t understand or are just too immature to see the vision that I have for my future.&nbsp; I just want stability for myself and my family, which from my birth to this very day I&#039;ve never had. I&#039;ve never once been stable. The most stable I ever became in life was after I made that first sale. Sad but true. I just want someone that&#039;s really mature and wise to talk to. To vent to. Who knows maybe some day it could be a two way street. Anyhow, thanks for listening at the very least. I don&#039;t know what I expected, but then again I don&#039;t even know what to do.

				I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find an anon to vent to. Though an illegal drug trade forum wouldn&#039;t have been my first choice for reaching out.

Most people outside of the lifestyle will tell you to leave it alone immediately hands down as if it were a light switch that you can just cut on and off.

				I feel what you&#039;re saying but I have my family to think of. I&#039;ll stop what I&#039;m doing when I know for a fact they have something to fall back on. I just can&#039;t leave my wife hanging out here with 2 kids alone. And yeah any day I could get snatched up, but everyday I&#039;m making money. Food on table, clothes on backs. I definitely want out but I don&#039;t even know where to start as far as investing my money in long-term goals. But for right now I definitely have to weather this storm.

				Mate, just vent right here in this thread. Honestly, if you&#039;re coming here for someone to listen to, where everyone is trying to be anon, then really the benefit you&#039;re getting out of this is the vent, not the advice that people give back. So go right ahead, let it all out.<br /><br />Just be aware that trolls will troll. But someone helpful might respond as well.

				If you can somehow try get some money together (and I realise at times that&#039;s a lot easier said than done) might be worth lawyering up trying to get the LE out of the way. That stuff doesn&#039;t go away. At least then you can start to make longer term decisions without fear of a 6am wake up at any time. Knowing nothing of your situation though I don&#039;t know what the LE would be lookig for. If your lawyer could make a&nbsp; deal turn yourself in, register in a rehab (if it was a drug related offence) you never know, might get a non-custodial and that would be a massive weitght off.<br /><br />Prohibition really sucks , the OP seems decent guy and his life and countless others ruinedf by popping a&nbsp; pill or smoking a bit of weed. Don&#039;t think any of us will ever see attitudes change in our life time though.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know you from Jack but if you ever want send me a PM something not say in public feel free, but when it comes down to it you&#039;re going to be&nbsp; the one making the shit decisions. When I was at rock bottom I tried take a medium- to long term view. Think where I was a year ago (rock bottom still) bur if I started again and treied even with a shit job and prospects things could look a lot different in a year. 10 years now since I gained some kind of control and I really have came a long way. So difficult that first month or two when nothing is improving to just say &#039;fuck it&#039; though. I did that a few times myself.
