				The following are the details for the next game:<br /><br />Texas Holdem Lotto 0.1: 23 people, 1 wins 2.3BTC<br /><br />Number: THL#001<br />Ticket price: 0.1 BTC + SR fee (limit 1 per person)<br />Players: 23<br />Pool: 2.3 BTC<br />Payout: 2.3 BTC<br />Rake: 0 BTC (0%)<br />1 Paid<br />1st 2.3 BTC (tie splits)<br /><br />I will be taking no rake for this first game. And it is a stealth listing only being advertised in the forums.<br /><br />Assignments: Each player gets their 1st card, then each player gets their 2nd card, then flop, turn, river, and the last card will be unused (unless player0 is dealt first, in which case the first card will be unused).<br /><br />Which player is dealt first? The last digit in the MD5 of the screenshot will be summed with the last digit in the filename of the screenshot at onion image uploader (and if the total &gt;9 then that 2-digit number will be summed again), and the resulting number is the number of the player that will be dealt first. If the sum is 0 then the first card dealt will be unused.

				I&#039;ve delisted the tickets for this lottery from the Digital goods and Tickets category. Now there&#039;s just the listing in the new Lottery and games category:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/347d84ea8b<br /><br />That listing has additional explanations, but it&#039;s the same game. You can know it&#039;s the same game because the game details match the ones posted above in this thread.

				Are we going to have 5 pooled (shared) cards and each get 2 individual cards like holdem or each get 5 or 7 individual carts to make the best hand? I live in just across the CAL/Nevada border and near several casinos and play a lot of holdem so this sounds real fun and inspired. Any thoughts about factoring in additional bets after the start of the game as in real holdem or would that be too difficult? Also there are several on line poker sites that allow private games &quot;you need a password to get in&quot; so you might consider that in the future. Thanks again. Tahomas

Tahomas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In Texas Holdem Lotto each player gets 2 hole cards and everyone shares the 5 cards on the board, and the best 5-card hand that can be made is the winner (some games might have more winners, from best to worst hand). Right now, the cost of a ticket (the &quot;ante&quot;), is all that goes into the pot. (Although I might do freerolls at some point).<br /><br />Since I&#039;m a new vendor, I don&#039;t think betting rounds is a good idea at this time, because I&#039;d be asking people to trust me (and every other player) that card information is unknown. I&#039;ve tried to create a process of doing a drawing where people don&#039;t have to trust me. The order of the cards and who gets dealt first is out of my control. If people wanted to bet, they would probably have to bet blind before any cards were dealt. Texas Holdem usually has a small blind and big blind, but I haven&#039;t considered how to do that yet.<br /><br />Maybe when I get more established I could consider betting rounds, maybe by posting an encrypted message of how the cards were shuffled and dealt, but hiding the cards and betting rounds would increase the likelihood of cheating and collusion, since we&#039;re all anonymous people on the deep web. A dishonest operator could tell a player someone else&#039;s cards. If each player knew their own cards, they could tell their friends, and work together, and so on. In a real life game, a dealer might be able to tell if players were sharing information with each other. Not online though.<br /><br />If you would prefer a bitcoin poker game that has bets and is not on the Silk Road, I have heard of https://sealswithclubs.eu which supposedly uses the software Poker Mavens by Briggs Softworks, but even that site says opponents might be cheating, and says the only way to ensure it&#039;s a fair game is if two people play heads up. I&#039;ve never tried it and I can&#039;t vouch for it, but you might like something like that.

				It&#039;s taken a long time but we finally have 23 players for THL#001.<br /><br />When every player on the waiting list has finalized, the game will begin. Since I&#039;m a new vendor it might take 2 or 3 days for everyone to finalize. If some players do not finalize, more tickets will be sold for this game and they will have a chance to finalize and get a seat.<br /><br />Good luck to all players!<br /><br />To show I&#039;m running an honest game, I won&#039;t create a new game listing until I&#039;ve paid out for this first game.

I think 23 people was too ambitious a goal for this first game. And with the new finalization policy for new vendors, this game has taken much longer to start than I expected.<br /><br />Hopefully when I become more established, tickets will sell faster. I&#039;ve also come up with games where people can buy as many tickets as they want.<br /><br />I can offer several games at the same time, with different buyins. I just haven&#039;t done that yet since I&#039;m a new vendor, and I think buyers should be able to see that winners are actually being paid.<br /><br />What did you have in mind by &quot;high stakes&quot;? I would like to start small at first. But as I get more established I could build up to that.

The last digit in the MD5 of the screenshot will be summed with the last digit in the filename of the screenshot at onion image uploader (and if the total &gt;9 then that 2-digit number will be summed again), and the resulting number is the number of the player that will be dealt first.

				The listing is back up on the site. The details for THL#002 are the same, only the game number has changed. I&#039;ve fixed the links in the listing.<br /><br />Feel free to wait to buy a ticket until the prize listing has feedback:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/61e6425b52<br /><br />A little later I may list a different game where people can buy as many tickets as they want.

So the pot is now worth about $3.98 more than it would have ((6.78-5.05)x2.3). Tickets also cost a few cents more.<br /><br />In the future I might peg ticket prices to USD.
