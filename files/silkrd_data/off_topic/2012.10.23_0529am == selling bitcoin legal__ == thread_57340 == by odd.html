				I posted this in Off-Topic because i wasn&#039;t sure where this belonged and figured this was the best bet.&nbsp; I&#039;m a little curious..... Now i know that buying bitcoins is totally legal but do you need a license or anything like that to sell bitcoins legally or can anyone sell bitcoins legally? Like for instance if there was a vendor on SR that offered bitcoins that would be totally legit right? or am i completely wrong?

				No it would not be legal because you could be fucked for facilitating the sale of illegal shit which comes with a heavy weight I think.

				Feel free to check it out, you&#039;re basically aiding and abetting or and helping facilitate a criminal transaction. They could technically get you on a conspiracy if they could prove you knew details as well and did it on a regular basis.

				thank you guys very much i think i see what you&#039;re saying....in general selling bitcoins is completely legal and fair game, but i think what limitless is taking into account is the part about a vendor on SR selling bitcoin.&nbsp; It would make sense that by offering it directly on the SR market it might be considered aiding and abetting.&nbsp; Thanks for the clarification!

				It is legal in most western countries (I don&#039;t know of any that has a law against it), but if you appear to have gotten a large sum of BTC out of nowhere, it does look suspicious.<br /><br />In the same way, it&#039;s perfectly legal to make a cash deposit into your bank account. However if you frequently visit the bank with big amounts of cash, you are going to get investigated.

				Buying and selling BTCs is perfectly legal. They are often used for illegal activities so that&#039;s why people go to great lengths to cover their tracks in purchasing BTCs.
