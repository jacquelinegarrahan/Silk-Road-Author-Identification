				Greetings Ladies and Gentlemen,<br /><br />The Wau Holland Foundation has collected over $1.2 million USD for WikiLeaks. On December 4, 2010, PayPal turned off donations in response to the foundation&#039;s connection to WikiLeaks.<br /><br />The Wau Holland Foundation is now using Bitcoins as a form of donation as we can no longer accept donations through any major credit cards or online financial service providers.<br /><br />If you are interested in supporting FREEDOM and Wiki Leaks, please consider making a small contribution to our Bitcoin address: 1AEg1kSTRrJdqTsbLsyJYTqqLsFfRsibqJ<br /><br />Thank you for your help!

				Nice try mate.<br /><br />No mention of bitcoins on Wau Holland foundations website and no mention of Wau Holland collecting bitcoins on Wikileaks website. This address is also different to the one given for Bitcoin donations on Wikileaks website.<br /><br />Unless I am very much mistaken this might not be entirely what it seems.

We kindly ask you not to post comments that will deter potential donations. If you feel that we do not deserve any contributions, that is your opinion and you are entitled to it and you do not have to make a donation.<br /><br />All we ask is for a 1 Bitcoin donation from the users who are willing to help this cause. Every last cent counts towards our victory in the struggle for FREEDOM!

				All I am saying is that I would have thought that you would have mentioned it on your website before registering on a drugs forum. <br /><br />http://www.wauland.de/english.html<br /><br />I am not trying to deter anybody from supporting Wikileaks and have given them bitcoins myself but I do want to advise people to double check who they are actually giving their money to.
