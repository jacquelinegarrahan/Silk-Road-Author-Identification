				&nbsp;So of all the times I&#039;ve rolled off MDMA it&#039;s always been at night in a party environment or with the boys. But I was wondering what Rolling off MDMA is like in the broad daylight? Do some of you have preferences of how and when to roll?&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve only used it during the day on a festival while in a tent or building (and only getting out after sun down), so I can&#039;t really comment on that. I do however had some serious shitty come downs on MDMA in the summer: while you&#039;re coming down it&#039;s getting light (which felt awful). It&#039;s especially bad when you&#039;ve managed to make you living room dark, but have almost no way of getting your bedroom properly dark.<br /><br />I suppose that this is not a problem if you roll during the day. I think it would be very nice on a warm spring day, chilling in the grass with some good techno playing (wearing of course sunglasses ;) ).

				I enjoy it during the day. Specially at festis. Honestly. I like to go lay in a grass patch and just watch the clouds for a little bit. Try it sometime.&nbsp; :D

				Personally I like to roll right before the day ends and the night begins. Something about seeing the sun go down and the stars come out mentally prepares me for what I am about to get into, whether it be a concert, just staying home and chilling with the wife, or spinning on the turntables. I&#039;ve never seen MDMA as a daytime drug. I&#039;m not sure I could enjoy it that way TBH. <br /><br />I also like to do this with Shrooms as well. I&#039;ve had some kick ass trips watching the day fade into the night.
