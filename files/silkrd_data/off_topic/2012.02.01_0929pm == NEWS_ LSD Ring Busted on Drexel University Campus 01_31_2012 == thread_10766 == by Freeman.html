The potent hallucinogenic drugs were hidden in a Sponge Bob Square Pants children&#039;s book.<br />But this was not child&#039;s play. This was a major, million-dollar drug ring on the Drexel University campus.<br />&quot;We believe the defendants were selling LSD for over a year before our office was able to break up this ring,&quot; said Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams.<br /><br />Investigators caught a break a couple of weeks ago, when, on January 18, Upper Moreland Police busted a man there on gun charges.<br /><br />&quot;At which point he informed Upper Moreland he could help us with information on an acid ring,&quot; said Deputy District Attorney Brian Grady.<br /><br />Police soon closed in on the ring leaders: Raphael Zappala, 33, of 50th Street in Philadelphia; Joshua Dassay, 31, of Florence Street in Philadelphia; and Wesley Crawford, 34, of Haverford Road in Ardmore, Pa.<br /><br />Police say the trio sold the acid mainly to Drexel University students. The D.A. says the group was selling the drug for $10 to $30 a hit. Investigators estimate the defendants were clearing $5,000 to $15,000 a week during that time period.<br /><br />Around midnight Tuesday morning police set up a buy and raided a home in the 4800 hundred block of Florence Street.<br /><br />They seized 950 hits of LSD with a street value of about $28,000 and $10,000 in cash and arrested the three alleged masterminds.<br /><br />They say Dassay had his bags packed and was ready to flee the area.<br /><br />&quot;He is currently wanted in nine states in the United States of America,&quot; said Grady.<br /><br />Two others, including one Drexel student, were also arrested, but their names have not been released because they are confidential informants cooperating with authorities.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s sad this was taking place on a campus of higher learning,&quot; said Williams. &quot;I hope the actions of a few don&#039;t tarnish the image of educational excellence that we associate with Drexel University.&quot;<br /><br />Late Tuesday afternoon, Drexel University released the following statement on the arrests:<br /><br />&quot;Drexel University has a zero tolerance policy for any type of illegal activity and takes immediate disciplinary action, including criminal prosecution. Drexel University Police fully cooperated with the District Attorney&#039;s Dangerous Drug Offender Unit, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and Philadelphia Police, resulting in the arrests of five people connected to an LSD ring operating in University City.<br /><br />&quot;Although two Drexel students were involved, the masterminds of the operation arrested today were not affiliated in any way with Drexel and operated out of a house on 48th Street, not on the Drexel campus.<br /><br />&quot;The University complies with all state and federal regulation in the dissemination of information. When Drexel is made aware of any students participating in illegal behavior, the University places them on indefinite suspension pending the outcome of the investigation by Philadelphia and Drexel police.&quot;<br /><br />The alleged masterminds could face up to 100 years behind bars if convicted.

				God damn, what a load of bullshit. Shouldn&#039;t be sent to jail for something like that, and certainly not for 100 years. Such a shame...

				100 years top is indeed very sad and extreme, but not surprising at all. US Gov has always had a hard-on for anything very psychedelic, even though &quot;most&quot; are not even physically addictive, while highly addictive things like opiates carry lighter jail time and are pharmaceutically sanctioned. Not talking specific trash about opiates, as all compounds serve true individual purposes in some way.

				People just don&#039;t know how to keep their mouth shut anymore. That goes for the snitches, and the dealers themselves. Let&#039;s face it. A lot of people doing any kind of distribution (whether it be serious weight or .5 bags of whatever) brag about their methods of income, and are WAY too damn flashy. Especially big-timers. I mean, look at Meech. He had all of Atlanta on lock. Dude man is driving around in porches, lambos, RRs, and all kinds of shit. Buying out Magic City for the night and all that shit. There is 2 main rules to this shit. Stay low key, and shut the fuck up.

				100 years.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />How can any rational person think that 100 years for consenting adults to partake in temporarily mind altering drugs be normal...<br />but the permanent results of a murder or rape can get you out in 10-20.&nbsp; <br /><br />Absolutely insane.

				Remember, all the numbers are distorted or inflated in some way when it comes out of the mouths of police chiefs or media outlets.<br /><br />By 100 years they mean 100 years MAXIMUM split between THREE people.&nbsp; Thats a MAXIMUM of 33.3 years per person.&nbsp; You never get maximum unless your just a violent idiot, which i doubt college guys selling tons of acid are that type.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet they wont even get half that 33 year sentence.
