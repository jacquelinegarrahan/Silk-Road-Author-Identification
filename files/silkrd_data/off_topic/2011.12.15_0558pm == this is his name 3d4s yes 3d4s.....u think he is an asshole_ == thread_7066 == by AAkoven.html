				I was looking on the front side ..and i see this; about a dutch vendor..for 2 fucking pills...&nbsp; &nbsp;`he&nbsp; &nbsp;3d4s&nbsp; give&nbsp; &nbsp;A 1\5.. yes.!! <br /><br />After greater than 3 weeks it was determined that my package was not going to arrive. That&#039;s fine...stuff happens. But the resolution process is why I am leaving negative feedback - He only refunded me 50%! It is only acceptable to not refund money to cover the costs of the lost shipment. For my purchase there was no way that those margins were 50%. Anything over covering your costs is theft and compromises the legitimacy of silkroad! Do not buy from premiumdutch...if your shipment is lost he will only refund 50%!!<br /><br />{ i give also 50 % if u start giving 100 % back..there are so many scammers&nbsp; &nbsp;now...&nbsp; ]<br /><br />Am asking ..is this guy a LE..try to destroy someones rep.!<br />Its not easy to ship pills..all the sellers of this know it.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Dutch pill sellers jump in here...lets make a list off buyers who just like to fuck ` your&quot;rating up.!<br />I get also&nbsp; a&nbsp; &nbsp;2..or&nbsp; 3 \ 5&nbsp; &nbsp;..just for fuck sake&nbsp; ,&nbsp; end i mailed SR&nbsp; about it..well he told me He don,t care less..<br />1 person knock off 2 points And it take 40&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; 5\5 to get 1 point up again..&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />U think that is fair?<br /><br />...AAkoven&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; btw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for me HE&nbsp; &nbsp;3d4s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is an asshole.!!! fuck you &quot;...<br />&nbsp;

				I totally agree with you, this is innapropriate.<br />Shipping Extascy is not the easiest thing in the world.When sellers decide to order Extascy or any product for that matter ,they should keep in mind the product cannot arrive and that if this happens it is often not the fault of the sellers!<br />When you put a lot of energy in Premium packaging and Premium communication , and buyers decide to give you a 1/5 it is extremely unfair.<br /><br />Buyers need to understand that when packages do not arrive it is not our fault ! and that they should thus not damage our rating so harshly.<br /><br />I agree with you AAkoven ,&nbsp; unfortunately not all customers are as nice as some. There will be people who decide to knock your rating down immensely for no particular or fair reason , all we can do about it , is not sell to the particular customer in future again.<br /><br /><br />

				50% is the default refund if the seller is unable to prove that he shipped the item (ex with a DCN#). It&#039;s not fair to throw accusations around about claiming someone is LE over something completely normal.<br /><br />I find it bizzare that PremiumDutch1 is agreeing with AAkoven which he said &quot;Do not buy from premiumdutch.&quot; <br /><br />This makes my head hurt with confusion.

				Ah, that makes much more sense. I know what you mean when it comes to &quot;bad english.&quot; I&#039;m really good at it when the person&#039;s first language is French. Other languages? Not so much.

				I agree that 1/5 for a 50% refund is bad, and I agree that 3d4s is an asshole.<br /><br />However, I do not think a non-receive partial refund should get a 5/5.&nbsp; Delivery success rate is more on the shoulders of the venders than the buyer since they are responsible the the stealthiness of the shipping<br /><br />everything else equal, a buyers rating should be scaled to the amount refunded. 0-20% refunds should get a 1/5. 20%-40% refunds should get a 2/5. 40%-60% refunds should get a 3/5. 60%- 80% refunds should get a 4/5 and 100% refunds should get a 5/5.

				this is from a buyer&#039;s POV:<br /><br />good sellers like aakoven shouldn&#039;t get too hung-up on the numbers. there are dicks out there, we buyers know that - so if we see the majority of your feedback is 5/5, we know that a sudden 1/5 is the sign of a dick at work. it&#039;s pretty easy to tell who the good sellers are without even looking at the feedback stats.<br /><br />btw, is it just me or is the post *completely fucked* in the u.k. /e.u. at the&nbsp; moment?
