				I&#039;m a little late to this thread but just thought I should add once again how much Nomad will be missed. Since I started on the road almost 2 yrs ago his posts have been very helpful in guiding me to using the site in a safe, professional, and courteous manner. I recently was able to acquire some of his art and I must say that it is truly a piece of SR history that I will always cherish. Although I have never purchased his Common Sense listing, I am sure that it would pay for itself 10x in the value of the information. Please do your research before you raise suspicion over one of, if not the most, beloved member of this community.

Advice from nomad was often sharp and to the point with no BS involved, but............. it was also sharp and to the point with no BS involved. I first heard of nomad when I was a Newbie, and already familiar with his postings by time I was Full Member. There is no way I would defend a scammer. I have to say if anyone else on Silk Road put up a consultation listing, I would not put it in my cart, and that includes DPR, inigo and the mods, no offense fellas. (You go with who you know.) <br /><br />There was some member who wrote a lot of inflammatory stuff in his posts (can i say troll?) and only person he paid a compliment to in over 100 posts as far as I could see, was nomad. Makes you stop and think doesn&#039;t it. <br /><br />Anyway. Just had to get it off my chest.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />(+Karma thread was his idea btw)

				Thank you everyone for your replies!<br /><br />At first it might look like I got slapped in the face a few times for starting this post (and it did bring me some negative karma), but in fact I&#039;m glad I started this post for the following reasons:<br /><br />- first of all: now I know who Nomad is and I&#039;m glad I learned it<br />- secondly: I&#039;m sure that Nomad, being who he is, can appreciate my effort to keep SR as safe and scam free as possible. Not knowing him made me start this thread and if I had know him I would probably not have done such - but the idea was good and based on the wish to keep the Road clean and nice for all. <br />- I will go with you guys and suppose that the owner of the username &quot;Nomad bloodbath&quot; on the forum is the same guy that owns the username &quot;Nomad bloodbath&quot; on the main site...but this is not always the case. If someone else was abusing Nomad&#039;s name on the main site, this could have been a scam anyway - even with such a strong and respected name. <br /><br />In the end, if I ever make such a &quot;mistake&quot; again I hope people will remember that it comes from positive energy and yes, maybe also a bit from ignorance, but often just because I can&#039;t remember names without knowing faces - something that is impossible on this forum. <br /><br />Anyway, <br />if Nomad reads this I hope he&#039;ll appreciate the attention that this thread brought to his listing - maybe it even got him some new customers... <br /><br />@Nomad: if I offended you in any way I hope you&#039;ll accept my apologies for this. <br /><br />@all the others who reacted: don&#039;t feel offended, nor sad. Open communication and exchange of information can only strengthen the community - even if sometimes it&#039;s not the smartest guy or the best informed guy who starts a thread.<br /><br /><br />And now I wish to end my comment by quoting some words from someone who was much smarter and better informed than myself: &quot;peace &amp; love&quot;.
