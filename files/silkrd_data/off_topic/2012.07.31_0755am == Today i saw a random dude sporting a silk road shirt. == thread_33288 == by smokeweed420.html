It represents our individual sovereignty, and makes a stand against those who would wish to control us. It is a community built around Agorist ideals, and to exclude people simply because we deem them &#039;inadequate&#039; or &#039;foolish&#039; - indeed to make we who are already here &#039;the elite&#039; of this underground society - would be to restrict the freedom that we all have had the pleasure of experiencing. This must never be allowed to happen.<br />We must attempt to take down the current system using the theory of counter-economics, and in order to accomplish that we need as many people as possible to partake in what Silk Road has to offer, and support what this community is trying to achieve.<br /><br />To come at it from another angle; what if you were yet to stumble upon Silk Road, but when you eventually do, you find that it&#039;s invite-only? Why should those of us who are already here get to experience these freedoms and choices when you don&#039;t?<br />When one demands a restriction on freedom in order to increase one&#039;s security, where will the restrictions end?<br />The American president Benjamin Franklin put it perfectly in 1775 when he stated: &quot;Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.&quot;<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Why don&#039;t we just make silkroad a clearnet site then? more people could access it and their would be no security!<br /><br />Making sr invite only would simply make it so that only people who really wanted to join would join.

What makes an open forum such as this better, in my own personal opinion of course, is the greater range of experiences from people from all walks of life, and people of all levels of education and intelligence. No one is denied access for any reason - here we are all equal. My argument was not that the Silk Road forums are best because they are big, it was that they are better because they&#039;re open to all.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33288.msg379663#msg379663">Quote from: 34tuforlunch on July 31, 2012, 02:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t buy drugs on silkroad, im a vendor and silkroad is a decent site but the community does not have some amazing spirit that binds is all together as part of the silkroad brotherhood.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Silk Road was BUILT around agorist principles. I would disagree with your argument that the community doesn&#039;t have an amazing spirit that binds us all together. We&#039;re all united by our actions. By taking part in a community like this we are refusing to submit to those who wish to control us. We all initially came here for the same reasons I suppose - buying and selling drugs - but in doing so we all became part of something more.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I really dont see how wearing a shirt with a camel on it could get you arrested......&nbsp; even if it the camel looks the exact same as the SR camel, its still just a camel.&nbsp; Now if the shirt read &quot;Silk Road&quot;&nbsp; and had a camel on it, then thats just asking for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;You have to think though, most of the regular small-town cops have no clue about this place.

And since you THINK nobody in the world knows about SR except you WTF would wearing a shirt with a camel do? =D If you think SR is going to get shutdown because someone was wearing a camel shirt i just want to say YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT( And i say that with love &lt;33333)

				I feel proud to wear my Silk Road T-shirt and wear it any chance I get- maybe I was the random dude although I probably wasn&#039;t fucked up.<br /><br />My opinion on the matter is that it&#039;s a chance to show support for people being able to make their own choices and live their lives the way they want to. I&#039;ve had one hippie-girl at the co-op say &quot;cool shirt&quot;, and I was like, &quot;right on&quot;, we had a cool, unspoken connection and we left it at that. Another time a nurse at urgent care said &quot;Oh, did you go to Egypt?&quot; to which I replied &quot;No, but my friend did.....&quot; My experience in general is that most people don&#039;t give a shit. Only a motivated person finds SR and learns what they need to safely purchase things. If they don&#039;t bother to implement to required tools then they deserve to get busted.

				This thread made me think. How secure is SR? I mean from being raided/physically shut down by LE.<br /><br />Are they hosted in a friendly country and pretty much untouchable like Pirate Bay? Or will legal threats make them shut down?<br /><br />Obviously I dont know where you are (other than an english speaking country) but if you are in UK or USA look out for the Salvation Army. Much as I dislike organised religion, these guys, unlike many so-called Christians,&nbsp; do actually practice Christian values and actively help those in need. <br /><br />If you are UK reply and I ll give you some places to try.

				people on this forum would be horrible drug dealers, theirs a reason the mexican cartel does not have their own jerseysm, when doing illegal stuff it is best to stay discrete. I give silkroad another two years or so before it is overrun with newfags and shut down.

				Hiding the SR like it&#039;s something to be whispered about is outrageous. SR is revolutionary.<br />While it may not be the smartest personal decision to advertise anything drug-affiliated, it goes against what SR for to just say that a select few people [invite only] should be allowed on the site.

				wearing a T-shirt with a camel on it can&#039;t get you arrested, not even when it has the site name and onion url printed all over it. on the off chance that some cop knows what this is, you might get a place on his watch list though. anyway, it is not illegal to know about this site or even to be registered here. well, in sudan it probably is, but even there it&#039;s worse listening to music than using the internet. listening to music while using the internet may get you beheaded i guess.<br /><br />it&#039;s great people use T-shirts like this publicly. there is no unwanted attention. SR was mentioned all over the world in newspaper articles, tv shows, it&#039;s on every other clearnet introduction to the deep web, it&#039;s on wikipedia... this is no hidden site. it&#039;s a hidden service. and the point it&#039;s a hidden service is that it can&#039;t get shut down like a clearweb site. plus, people need to use TOR to access it, so even when drunk and stoned you can connect and not automatically give away sensitive data.

We need to stop new users from coming in either buy invitation or a wait list like arc-research does. This place is getting to big and scammers are becoming more and more of an issue. I saw some dude trying to peddle BLUE mdma moon rocks, looked like they came out of a fish tank or something. Plus all the big vendors are vanishing and all this shit it just aint right. we need to have something done. the biggest of all is being able to see who left feedback for whatever transaction has occured because I feel like there are a lot of vendors boosting their stats then vanishing once they made their money.

				I agree wearing a t-shirt to publicize your SR usage is a bad idea, but in the end he is only baiting himself up. Don&#039;t worry about what he is doing, worry about what YOU are doing. As many have mentioned, SR already has a shit ton of attention and some guy wearing a t-shirt isn&#039;t going to make that much of a difference.<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit selfish to say the site should be invitation only now that you have already managed to get here. How would you feel if you was on the other side of the fence? SR is not your own private drugs market. Limiting the people that can join SR would also limit the potentially valuable information they would have to contribute. Look at the wealth of information that is available on this site. Do you think it would be the same vibrant community it is now if it was invitation only?&nbsp; ::)

				Dude this is cool. Doesn&#039;t matter if its some frat boy faggot wearing the shirt. It just means there are more people using silk road, which was the whole plan to begin with. The bigger it is the harder it is to kill, and the more evidence there is that it&#039;s all kosher. Sounds good to me

				if SR was invite only, i would have never been let on.&nbsp; as time will prove, I&#039;m&nbsp; likely to be a great contributor to the spirit SR.&nbsp; i used to be involved in a few sites like ftwr, undrugged, r-c.org...&nbsp; &nbsp;after they where shut down i was without my sacraments for years. <br /><br />what i could tell about those closed/invite only sites.. is they eventually become flooded with ego&#039;s and scams.&nbsp; sr only work because it&#039;s damn near open.&nbsp; a sense of snub may take over to not let&nbsp; your secrets out in the open.<br /><br />sr already takes a bit of work the avg drug user wouldn&#039;t go through to get their poison.&nbsp;

				fucked up + SR shirt = great image<br /><br />It seems a bit asinine to make a shirt about a generally illegal website, but then again we cant be sure this shirt wasn&#039;t made by him, by someone not associated at all with SR or by a vendor on the site for the general consumer base here.<br /><br />Imagine if it was some guy who knows about SR through popular media (like the magazine SR was promoted in or the news) and as a way to fight suppression and promote freedom of speech(and what not) starts making these shirts to lash out. Not likely the case, but the point is SR is already mainstream and we cant really assume that people wont want to make money off of popular memes. Invite only wont stop other people making products that might be tagged with this logo. DPR hasn&#039;t got any copyrights on it I assume and if he did that would make him an obvious target.<br /><br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />-Amush
