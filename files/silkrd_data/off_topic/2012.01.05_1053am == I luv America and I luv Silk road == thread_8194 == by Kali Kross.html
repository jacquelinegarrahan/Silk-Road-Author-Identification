				I am American and I feel like I am lucky to live in such a wonderful nation. I am also a member of the Silk Road community and I am very lucky to be a member of such a unique and incredibly interesting community. Silk Road is the future and its really something special to be a part of this community. I love my country and I would die with pride for her. <br /><br />The biggest flaw in America is the drug policy. But even with this huge flaw its still wonderful. Once I found Silk Road it was like the flawed drug policy of America no longer held me back. I believe that anyone over 17 and 9 months has a right to ingest substances as they feel fit. Some will turn to addicts but we need to help them not outlaw them.<br /><br />I hope Silk Road and websites like it continue to defy the American drug policy. Ultimately I hope that sites like Silk Road can serve as another point against the flawed drug war. <br /><br />The Silk Road community is proving to American policy makers that drug users arnt criminal scum bags. Any LE that spent time on Silk Road forums would come to the conclusion that the Silk Road community is made up of intelligent people with good intentions. We have bad apples but there is always someone there to help when you need them.<br /><br />Silk Road is special and so is America. Silk Road is helping so many Americans express their god given right to freedoms. <br /><br />Long live the Silk Road and may America forever be prosperous. <br /><br />*Sorry about my blurb but I just wanted to let ya know my thoughts
