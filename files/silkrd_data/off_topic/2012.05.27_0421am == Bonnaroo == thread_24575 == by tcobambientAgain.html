				OK.&nbsp; So, it&#039;s gonna be my first time going to Bonnaroo.&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda stuck because I can&#039;t get bitcoins until Tuesday and that means I can&#039;t order until Wednesday and I&#039;m leaving the following Wednesday morning so I&#039;m just wondering if I should try to get some stuff off of SR to take with me because it&#039;s from vendors I know or should I just wait and buy things at Bonnaroo?&nbsp; I&#039;m talking like shrooms, mdma, possibly acid.&nbsp; What&#039;s the scene like down there?&nbsp; I know there&#039;s drugs there but I have no way of testing them and I&#039;d feel better buying from people on SR who have had their shit reviewed.&nbsp; What&#039;s a boy to do?&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda high right now so I&#039;m not sure if all of this is making the best sense?&nbsp;

				I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have no trouble finding mdma, but as for shrooms and legitimate acid you might as well purchase them off of the market. Better safe than sorry, right? ;) Don&#039;t worry about your post by the way mate, it makes enough sense to me. God damn do I envy you though, I&#039;d kill someone to be able to go this year! :D

				Ah.&nbsp; I&#039;d figure you&#039;d have to worry about the quality of MDMA and not shrooms there.&nbsp;

				And a few tips:<br /><br />- During the first day a lot of sellers will walk around the camps and offer stuff - from my experience these guys are pretty legit - just make sure you taste the product if it&#039;s coke, molly, etc..<br /><br />- The majority of drugs are sold outside of center Roo (where the stages are). A lot of dealers will post up by the porta potty&#039;s and on the walkway - this is your best chance of finding something.&nbsp; This is where you should head when the sun goes down and there are big shows about to start. Stay away from people offering crazy good deals as it&#039;s prolly junk or fake.<br /><br />- You&#039;ll get searched before going into center Roo.&nbsp; You can take backpacks and usually they will just glance inside them.&nbsp; When I went I just put my drugs in my wallet.&nbsp; Just observe the lines and see which searcher is the quickest and just letting people through.<br /><br />- You will also get searched before going into Bonnaroo - it&#039;s pretty easy to get stuff through though.&nbsp; I just bought a hollowed out salt container and put everything in there.&nbsp; But just make sure stuff is hidden.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I&#039;ve been to Bonnaroo 6 times and never had a problem finding anything I wanted. BUT it&#039;s all about reading people. Talk with them for a few minutes try to feel them out. Especially with acid. Molly you should be able to taste it and tell if it&#039;s decent. Mushrooms thats a given just look and check the weight if possible. Doses are tricky you really have to weed through the B.S. talk to the person see if they know what their talking about. If they seem desperate to get rid of it then stay away. Anyone with good L is never desperate to get rid of it they know it will sell. I&#039;ve always bought at least a sheet or more so I would always buy a hit and have a friend test it for me. Most people will give you a free hit to sample if your buying more than a sheet, some wont. I was buying a vial one year and the dude dosed everyone at my camp for free and hung with us until they were feeling it, what a cool dude I should have bought all his vials that shit was FIRE!!!! Another time I was buying 3 sheets of gels and the dude made me pay $7 to buy a tab to test which is fine, his shit was fire too. The prices vary, I&#039;ve got legit sheets and vials for between $300-500 just use your best judgement and if buying doses test it first ;)
