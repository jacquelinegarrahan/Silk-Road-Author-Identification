				I never knew what NBOMe was till I came to SR. Did some quick reading on it and discovered it&#039;s supposedly similar to LSD and a very potent substance. Prices on SR are about 1/10th the price of LSD. Why? Is it just that shitty?

				None of the NBOMe chemicals are federally scheduled. Legal drugs stay cheap.<br /><br />They&#039;re very potent. Like 1000 doses/gram. So you don&#039;t need to make much in order to have a stockpile.<br /><br />Also, they&#039;re very new and very exotic chems. There isn&#039;t a huge market for them (except when people are pretending that they&#039;re LSD). Lots of questions still about safety..<br /><br />tl;dr: Supply &amp; Demand.<br /><br /><br />

				I see, didn&#039;t know it was unscheduled. Must be pretty cheap and relatively easy to make as well. I&#039;m curious about it, but yeah, I guess it hasn&#039;t been around long enough for there to have been sufficient studies to determine its health effects. Better give it some time and stick to good ol&#039; Lucy for now. I imagine a lot of scammers are making big cash selling NBOMe as LSD at a 1000% profit margin. I can see that becoming more of a problem as NBOMe becomes more accessible and widely known. In that case, I hope they make it illegal soon.<br /><br />Thanks for the answer.<br /><br />Follow-up question to anyone who&#039;s tried it: Anyone actually prefer NBOMe to LSD?

				It is definitely a problem being sold as lsd<br /><br />people have died from essentially recreational doses of nbome although not very common - while lsd is completely safe and basically non-toxic, so nbome should never be passed off as lsd<br /><br />i dont think i agree that it should be made illegal, people have the right to have access to psychedelics - lsd needs to be unbanned instead of nbome banned

I concur! However, call me a pessimist, but it&#039;s probably not gonna happen in this decade, sadly, so maybe the inevitable banning of NBOMe would at least stave off the A-holes passing it off as LSD, and even save some lives in that process. But yeah, in my perfect world, ALL drugs would be legal and people would simply be properly informed about them... and those who ignore that education would simply die off, hopefully before reproducing! Natural selection.

Swallow it. If it&#039;s lsd, you&#039;ll party, if not and it&#039;s nbome, you shouldn&#039;t notice anything.<br /><br />Edit: Also, if you&#039;re not sure what a blotter contains, either don&#039;t take it or only try a small amount. This is why SR is such blessing - you can be pretty damn sure (by checking the forums) that what you&#039;re buying is legit.

				I&#039;m awaiting some NBOME right now. pretty excited to try it out. from what I&#039;ve read on erowid and other places, it is a legitimate psychedelic, albeit a very new one (discovered in 2010 I believe?!)

				I&#039;ve taken 25i 4-5 times and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. It is not as good as LSD in my mind but that is beyond the point because it is a different drug. I hate hearing people say &quot;it&#039;s not LSD.&quot; No shit it&#039;s not LSD, its 25i. I was probably guilty of this myself, the first time I took it I wanted to see how similar it was to LSD and if it was a foolhardy copy. It is not. You shouldn&#039;t enter the trip hoping that it will magically be LSD as that is a sure-fire way to be let down. Go into it with an open mind. 25i-NBOMe is its own drug.

				You can use 2C-Xs as the starting compound, this would increase the potency 30x.. hence the price
