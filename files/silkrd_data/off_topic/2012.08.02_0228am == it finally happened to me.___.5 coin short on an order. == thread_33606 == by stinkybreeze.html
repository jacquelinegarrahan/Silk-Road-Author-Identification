				<br />Got it and THANK YOU big time !!!&nbsp; Totally makes this buy a lot safer as I know I will be home for it. Otherwise it would have <br /><br />been sitting for possibly days, which is never something I like very much. You and another sent me coin. I will send both of you <br /><br />double back in a matter of days. Thanks again!

				I know how you both feel I&#039;m a half BTC short on my order because of MP fees that cost more than expected and BTC fluxuation. It sucks because you can&#039;t just get a MP for a few dollars.
