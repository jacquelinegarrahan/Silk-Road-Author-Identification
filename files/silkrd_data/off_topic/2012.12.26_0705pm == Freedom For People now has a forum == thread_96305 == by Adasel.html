				Not that we want to take people from the silk road, oh no, we love this site.<br />If you are however interested in the fight against capitalism, it is still here.<br /><br />Here is the manifesto for FFP<br /><br />Freedom for People is here for you, the public. We are the army in the global war that is capitalism. Our enemies may be big, but that makes them more exposed, easier to hit. For far too long companies like BP, who cause oil disasters and ruin lives have gone unanswered in their crimes against humanity. News groups like the BBC publish false stories and accuse people for being paedophiles or killers without really knowing the truth. Banks and big business use our money in order to fund terrorism on a grand scale. And, of course, let us not forget the global crisis that is Rupert Murdoch. After the phone hacking scandal, lives being destroyed, he is still in business, still at the top. What happens when things go wrong and a bank collapses along with our money? The boss gets an even bigger bonus than last year. It is time to make a stand. Time to say enough is enough. The FFP is here and recruiting. If you care about the rights of man and fair justice, then join us. <br />&quot;Surely there never was so evil a thing as money, which maketh cities into ruinous heaps, and banisheth men from their houses, and turneth their thoughts from good unto evil.&quot; <br />SOPHOCLES, Antigone <br /><br />Please feel free to discuss. and, if you want to join or take a look at the forum, please email here<br />echofalls@tormail.org<br />Many thanks.<br />

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll find many sympathetic people here. The SR community is very pro-capitalism and libertarian. After all, SR is a market place with the explicit goal of engaging in unfettered trade.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96305.msg683640#msg683640">Quote from: Adasel on December 26, 2012, 07:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For far too long companies like BP, who cause oil disasters and ruin lives have gone unanswered in their crimes against humanity. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bad example to use.
