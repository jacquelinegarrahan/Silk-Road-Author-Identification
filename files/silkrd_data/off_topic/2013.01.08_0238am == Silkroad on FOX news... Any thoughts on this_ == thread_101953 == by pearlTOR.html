				There&#039;s a difference between one of the three major news channels in America actually airing it, and &quot;not hidden,&quot; though.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t realize it had been on Fox news.&nbsp; That sucks, quite frankly.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to turn up the heat on the DEA to shut it down.&nbsp; Whether they can/do or not is irrelevant, it&#039;s going to make them try harder, and that sucks.

				Things are going to change a lot throughout this year. Looking at the massive difference between when I joined back in February and now, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Silkroad was a household name by this time next year. The question is, does this mean the powers that be will scramble like decapitated chickens while we enjoy a wider variety of competitively priced products? Or will we actually start seeing more sensible drug laws? Or worst of all, will they actually bring us down, and even more importantly, find a way to ensure that no copycat sites can pick up the torch?<br /><br />Also can anyone provide some kind of proof that this fox news thing actually happened? Considering this account has 3 posts I&#039;m just going to assume troll or psy-op for now.

The general opinion is shifted towards distrust for large media networks as well. The percentages are small but the trend is extremely hopeful for our future.

				Wow, I have to say that was not what I expected in the slightest. I&#039;ve never heard of Stossel before but he seems like a pretty reasonable guy, and anyone who shits on Chuck Schumer is alright in my book. I&#039;m a pretty big fan of Reason magazine and that chick is wife material. <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have sauce on this unfortunately, I was at a friends house yesterday and I just heard a little piece of what was on there. Basically they were just labeling the road as some type of underground blackmarket that promotes the user/dealer lifestyle. <br />Although I have three posts, I&#039;m not a troll. I just like to read more than I like to participate, alot of the people on here are extremely intelligent and what they have to say interests me. <br />I only ask this question because after a year or so of looking at prices and whatnot I&#039;m preparing to make my first order. <br />And yeah, I guess you are all right. I&#039;m paranoid. But just because your paranoid doesn&#039;t mean nobodies watching. or somebody... i forget how the saying goes.

				Media hype about Silk Road.&nbsp; To totally stop it they&#039;d have to shut down the internet, which I don&#039;t see happening.&nbsp; The most they can do is try to catch individuals who make obvious mistakes and put themselves out there.&nbsp; Anything else is propaganda designed basically to send a message of &#039;we&#039;re gonna get you&quot; but they really won&#039;t if your careful.&nbsp; Just breathe, count to ten, place an order, and enjoy it when it arrives.
