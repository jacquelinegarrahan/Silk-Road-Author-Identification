				Okay, so first of all, sorry if this is placed in the wrong part of the forum. Second of all the reason I&#039;m asking is because of the very weird effects i got from it. But I&#039;ve just got back from holiday in Corfu, and on the last night me and a couple mates decided to purchase a pill each. <br />The pills cost 15euro each, they were pink and appeared to have a picture of a lady imprinted on them, but it wasn&#039;t very clear so I&#039;m not 100% sure. The pill was very small, no bigger than 5mm x 4mm. <br />So i decided to pop the pill just before we went to a beach party, within about 10/15mins, the effects hit me like a train, there wasnt much of a comeup, it just hit me. I was instantly put into a dreamlike state, the music and the lights became very intense and there was even some very slight hallucinations, both OEV &amp; CEV. my arms and fingers also tingled a lot. <br />It then hit me harder and harder, i had to start counting my fingers because i honestly believed i had lost one, weird i know.. I also kept forgetting where i was. At no point was a scared or paranoid, there was a very slight buzz but I&#039;d describe it as more of a &#039;emotionless state&#039; - No euphoria, no anxiety, no awkwardness when talking to strangers etc..<br />But i think the weirdest effect i had from the pill was that there was absolutely no urge to dance although it was very jittery, all i wanted to do was sit down and look into the sky and bob up and down and i was unable to lift my arms above my shoulders as the body load was absolutely huge. <br />these effects probably lasted about 2 hours with the comdown hitting me like a train about 4 hours later. But this comedown barely lasted a day.<br />My friends had no idea what it was, my first thoughts where benzo fury but after reading some trip reports on the internet I dont think it was. <br />Does anyone have any idea as to what it might have been?
