				I&#039;ve been hearing all these reports of ppl being able to create their own guns completely out of plastic using 3d printing..<br />What exactly is 3d printing and how could just anybody make a gun from it?<br />Is this the beginning of the end to gun control just like SR is the beginning of the end to drug control?

				You currently need an extremely expensive printer to print a viable gun. They are as inaccurate as all hell. The plastic barrel is not rifled. They melt and fall apart.<br /><br />Look it up on google or youtube. DEFCAD is leading the way.

				The files to make your own gun are free and open source.&nbsp; The state department has asked defense distributed to take the files down, but they are still available on the pirate bay.&nbsp; I am currently seeding the torrent.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its funny that the government has public service announcements telling young women to be careful about what they post on-line, how it can never be taken down ect.&nbsp; At the same time they think that they will somehow be able to delete the liberator blueprint from Internet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have donated bitcoin to defense distributed, Cody Wilson is doing great work :)

				Im seeding the torrent to spread the information so other people can print their own guns, but I&#039;m assuming you are asking why i donated bitcoin.<br /><br />I donated money to support the disruptive technology.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the government should be regulating what guns people can own, or how many bullets they should have in a magazine.&nbsp; As a medical marijuana patient, the Feds say i should not have access to a firearm because i am &quot;addicted to drugs&quot;.<br /><br />I am very much against gun control and donating to the project was my way to say FU to the feds and increase the access to firearms.

				yeah this is pretty damn cool, I cant believe how easy it&#039;s becoming, However i guarantee the Secret service will have something implanted in the high quality and level printers to tell who&#039;s printing guns on a large scale. The same as if you get high quality printers they monitor for counterfeit bills. <br /><br />The technology can only advance as we go along and in the next ten years or so, It&#039;ll all be widely available. But i can almost put a BTC on the fact that the government will try and restrict the tech and hold it back until they find a way to control it. <br />

We are about 20 years from a safe 3D ammo printer. The metal casing eliminates the possibility of plastic melting/fowling the firing mechanism and barrel. Also, there is the issue of the primer charge, so unless you are printing a flintlock, ammo should be left to military-grade manufacturers.

				I was talking to him about it the other day (before I saw these replies), he doesn&#039;t think his printer will be accurate enough either. It&#039;s a shame I was looking forward to 3D printing something :(

				I think it&#039;s cool. I&#039;m not really into guns but I am into the belief that the government is foolish to try and remove information that is already well embedded in the minds of the citizens. Trying to ban printed guns/gun files is like trying to ban/remove king size rizlas. Many people already know how to jury rig a king skin from smaller smoking papers. The knowledge of skinning up is passed on from person to person and has been in the collective minds of society for many years now. <br /><br />People have been making and firing guns for 100s of years. Nothing&#039;s going to stop them now.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like you can&#039;t already make a gun out of wood, or bits of old metal pipe and so on.<br /><br />Sorry for the shit rolling paper analogy.... I&#039;m a bit boxed just now *rolls eyes*
