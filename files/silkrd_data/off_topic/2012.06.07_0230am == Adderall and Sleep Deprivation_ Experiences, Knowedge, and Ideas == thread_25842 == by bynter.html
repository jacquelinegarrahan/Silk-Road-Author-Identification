				Note: Even if i state it like fact, this is pretty much my experience, and feel to constructively criticize advice or expecations. Well I shall write the majority of it right now, considering the experiences are fresher and still ongoing.(also, there&#039;s no way in hell my brain wouldn&#039;t force me to write this with the adderall still in it) The night prior, i had 15mg adderall at 7:00 and the other half 15mg about 3 hours later. Lately, The parents have been big about me getting regular sleep. So instead of doing homework, I just kept a low profile web browsing until they left at 7:00. The amount of adderall I took seemed perfect, as i never felt sleepy, yet never got that terrible feeling of emptiness for not doing something productive. 800mg caffiene and 30mg adderall at 8 this morning. The tapering adderall from 8 hours before kept me doing fine til the caffiene hit me. It kept me going for another hour, where I go to the point where if i was in my bed, i could be alseep 20 seconds tops. But without the drugs, i simply can&#039;t comprehend still being able to stay awake under any conditions. I thought the stories of it being able to keep you going until you died were made up. Then the adderall actually hit me. I was sort of back into a operatable mental state. Then it just ups and downs. Downs felt like being sober and awake at daytime on standard sleeping schedule, and ups feeling like a standard adderall dose to someone who&#039;s slept in the last 20 hours. Right now as i type this, it is about 6 hours after I had that adderall and caffiene combo. I feel fine as far as remaining awake, albeit a bit fatigued. Also, about half way through typing this, I felt the fainstest hint of the comedown starting. Aside from how tired I feel, let me list off the other effects, by category. <br /><br />(Also, can&#039;t help but stress the word &quot;unstable&quot; Different doses kick in, wear off, you redose at different times, get tired, so expect a certain amount of fluctuation.)<br /><br />Mind and Personality: If you stay up all night with caffiene, the next day, you simply give no fucks. Well it takes two days with this. Though going through that first day with caffiene, everything seems to be a lot stabler than the third day with Adderall. Anyways, what do I mean when I say that fucks are not given? You&#039;re lethargic. You give a lot fewer fucks when people criticize you. And the speech you convey to others will contain a lot less empathy. This mean&#039;s you&#039;re questions bolder, and assertions more ridiculous as logic stops carrying as much value.Earlier today,&nbsp; I asked for the temperature on a scale of &quot;dog to seventy six&quot; Totally serious too, and it even led to a legitimate debate about the arbitrarity of language. The Clothes I wore were dirty. Not stained, but they just had a dirty atmospehere. and you&#039;ll find that wearing such clothes feels more natural. Adderall seems to boost cognitive abilities, along with focus them so that you&#039;re doing one task at hand, and you&#039;re doing it very well. I find this works up to through day two. But by the time youre where I am, It&#039;s just keeping you at par. <br /><br />Speech: Expect the tones of your speech to fluctuate. Think &quot;G-man&quot; from the half life games&quot; With all his awkward, out of place syllable stressing. Except even more so. You&#039;ll find you&#039;re natural way of speaking will have so many different changes between sentences. Where you&#039;ll sound on the emphasis to lethargy scale. So much as a pause will see slow yelling on one side of the pause, and very fast smooth talking on the other. If you ever put on personality phrases,(Like if you simply said &quot;be cool&quot; telling somebody to chill, but did so in a Fonzie-esque accent) they will overdone. For whatever reason, someone jestingly though a projectile in my general direction. So I do an exaggerated karate scream and leap to hit it out of the hair. also, avoid single phrases when you can. More often than not, you&#039;lll think out what itll sound like, only for it be really high pitched(not cracking but close), mumbling, expressing the wrong tone(depressed &quot;yeahs&quot;) et cetera. When speaking sentences, the first few words you speak give you some ground do what you want with the sentence. Also, since you&#039;re so deydrated, there will be occurences when you&#039;re voice spontaneously jumps in pitch(again, not cracking, but similar). My tip for these is to go with it though the rest of the sentence as part of your emphasis. <br /><br />Appearance and such: Adderall is so powerful that certain urges never come up to be an issue. And that&#039;s means you&#039;ll never feel the need to bathe like you normally would. So yeah, just don&#039;t forget about it. Also, chapped lips. Maintain those. Blood shot eyes? Simple, eye drops. or sunglasses. Eye rings? Again sunglasses. No sunglasses? Cold water, tea bags, and cucumbers. research of course. and males probably wouldnt like this idea because of arbitrary male logic, but makeup. It really isn&#039;t all that unreasonable. <br />-You&#039;ll be skinnier,(course), but the skin just feels tighter.(I&#039;m sure partly responsible is the distorted sense of touch and feeling)<br /><br />Fixations: Cigarettes. Perpetually present pipes. Chew. Chewing gum. toothpicks. And this is where we get to the part I wanted to bring up. Short of taking combined the willpowers of Napoleon Bonaparte, Andrew Ryan, and every single soviet that survived Stalin&#039;s rule, and focussing it into yourself, you probably should expect both of these two to happen by your second day: rubbing your tongue against your teeth so hard that you won&#039;t have a single taste bud left, and chewing off all of those fingernails. It becomes really apparent just how much those pesky things are begging to be picked at. Also for the taste bud reason, chewing gum isn&#039;t a huge option(actually if you have chewing gum your tongue will probably focus on that. but your jaw muscles will want to see that come to an end after a while.&nbsp; Another thing is that the higher doses of adderall have me doing this thing of balling up my tongue at the front of my mouth and my tongue tries to hold up as i suck on it. It;s really hard to explain, but I imagine you know what I&#039;m talking about if if youve done it. this will make your whole mouth(especially cheeks) really sore really quickly. <br /><br />Sensations: I&#039;ve experienced perpetual back pain during this time that seemed to be just out of the reach of Aspirin(it still helps though). That&#039;s probably because most of this time has been spent at the desk doing homework. <br />- have your hand clutched around a pencil or typing away at a keyboard for a few minutes, and it&#039;ll be tingly, like when one of your limbs go numb, but much more amplified. This really happens anywhere, at adderall peak you can get it from the sliightly higher amount of pressure on leg if you cross your legs, and only about a minute after crossing them. <br />-I have my desk near a large opened window. Breezes of cold air that would be nominal, i find simply stunningly powerful, and painful, but nearly 100% of that pain is also getting diverted into some sort of masochist pleasure. <br />-Ive heard about halllucinations when you start getting into the more extreme sleeping-fasts. I haven&#039;t heard anything about them, but I assume it&#039;d be something similar to what you get from large amounts of dipenhydramine(bendadryl)<br />-Weird senations of cold, heat, and touch just seem to sort of come and go<br />-Pain: You&#039;ll expereince a lot less pain, but theres nit much pain being killed. To me, it feels like it&#039;s more of the adderall along with the body&#039;s sleep deprivation defense system that does a thing where the pain is still there, but caring about/registering the pain is below everything else on the body&#039;s priority list.&nbsp; <br />-Disconnect: touching things feels disconnected. even more so when things on your body are touched. Walking seems to be a process of the body that the mind does not seem to be part of. Sort of like a call of duty scripted sequence where the character is walking but you dont have control, but certianly not as intense as something like DXM could provide. You&#039;ll find you&#039;ll have less precisions in things like handwriting and make more typing errors.(one interesting point that handwriting can be observed and certain aspects in the writing will give large amounts of insight into their personality. Even in 2012, this sort of analysis on stimulant-intoxicated writers could give us new info on the drugs effect on the mind) Sometime this disconnect registers heavily in the consience mind. Looking back when constucting sentences, I&#039;ll find phrases interjected that could not be more misplaced.&nbsp; This disconnect is heavily related with tiredness, but after you get to the 72 hour point, no matter how much adderall you have in you, youre thinking skills aren&#039;t going to be able to go too far beyond observing. (more involved thinking skills being like analytical, hypothetical, critical)(also, I&#039;m not saying these sorts of thought processes are incapable of being thought be people in such a state. I&#039;m just saying that once you get to a point in sleep deprivation, even adderall is futile in anything beyond maintaining awakeness. Though I&#039; haven&#039;t slept in over 72 hours and ive put all kinds off thought into those. The presumptive absolute statement above about &quot;no amount of adderall can...&quot; is more of just a way of getting across that even with vast amounts of adderall or whataver, the well restd person with only 20mg will still fare cognitively better)<br />-Jitters, shaking, restless hands. Now shaking comes from a bunch reasons, probably related with blood pressure and stuff. Yeah, it&#039;s certainly the tell tale sign of someone in an altered state isn&#039;t good for sociabilty, but I&#039;ll leave research regarding that up to you. Restless hands, that&#039;s the powerful stimulants at work. I imagine sleep deprivation being combined with the stimulants is the reason for angsty social behaviors and jerky movements. <br /><br />-Being overall more comfortable. Now this is due to the disconnect I mentioned earlier, but here I&#039;m, focusing finding different more comfortable.Sitting in a chair abnorally.&nbsp; Holding things in abnormal ways because it suddenly feels natural, or the way you might way you walk or just experimenting with different poses standing stationary and conversing. A good example is if youve ever seen Episode 1 of Spongebob Squarepants(that&#039;s right, Spongebob Squarepants)(and you could find this on youtube really easily), to get into his garage, instead of walking, he slides out his window, along side of his house, onto his driveway, spins and slides under the garage door. Yeah, It&#039;s a bit ridiculous, but it&#039;s a perfect description of what the feeling is like<br /><br />-Moving along on our list of effects: Neglect of your body. I&nbsp; brought this up earlier with bathing, but there&#039;s all others. As you taste your breath all the time, I&#039;ve seemed to have remained quite conscientious about keeping my teeth brushed. Now I look at longer fasts as more desirable. They give you a great of achievement, act as a testament to willpower, are good for dieting(detectably), when you do go back to eating, the food you do eat tastes better. Also, amphetamines always make you feel full, along with diminishing&nbsp; your taste buds potency(if the taste buds havent been demolished by by your teeth)(which can also prevent you from enjoying food a few days after you stop amphetamine use). This is probably the biggest thing: WATTERRR!!! You don&#039;t feel like you need it, and it&#039;s not going to be pleasant to drink, but you must!!!! <br /><br /><br /><br />Also very worthy of note: music. i used to think to only way to get euphoria out of these sorts of drugs was through open conversations with close friends both under the effects. When I was at day two of sleep deprivation, i was doing algebra with avenged sevenfold playing loudly though ambiant speakers(headphones feel confining and i really dont think that theyd work). Anyways, Loud A7x though speakers while doing math on adderall is effective and enjoyable. The adderall already effectively overclocks your brain, and the music makes you naturally want to think and operate faster. If you&#039;re doing the sort of math where theres several problems an assignment, then you;re getting the constant satisfation of solving these, along with the adderall, and the music. I can legitimately say my brain was generating euphoria during the experience. <br />However, two things of note about this. Avenged Sevenfold probably isnt the best band to do this with. Since they;&#039;re so varied, music pacing is always changing. However this does bring about the occasianl needed breaks in pace. I say its doubled edged sword, and playlist software is your sheath. Other bands that would be really good for this sort of thing: dragonforce, luca turllili, rhapsody, Rage aginst the machine(theyre not&nbsp; necessarily all that fast, compared to previous but their songs are still quite fast and all sound the same. This would also work for eletronic, a sort of music with unlimited options for this. Beyond that though, i can&#039;t think of any genres for this. <br />Also, music that&#039;s new to you=bad since youre focusing on it and not the task at hand. Tnere are exceptions, which would be like Dragongorce, where songs sound similar, and the instuments drown out the lyrics unless youre tuned in for them <br />-Another note about this: MATH!! and other sorts of problem solving using techniques you already know. English and such is absorption and analysis, which requires focus. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That&#039;s almost everything I&#039;ve to say about sleep deprivation through adderall. Effective for getting alot done if you don&#039;t go past three days. then agian, you&#039; be fine going for more if you were just following the instructions of someone well slept. this is also just another testament to my belief that if everyone was giving methlyphenidate/this stuff, humainity would be mining from mars and poverty wouldnt exist . <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As far as the scatterbrained sentence structure, poor grammar, and bad spelling, keep in mind I havent slept or eaten in nearly 80 hours. Though now that that adderall I had at 9:00 am is fully kicking in and stabalizing. I definetely feel like i could still keep going with the substance. though it i hard on the heart and the wallet, so Ill save doing that for another time. <br /><br /><br />

				My advice, use it for something positive!<br /><br />you wrote out half a dissertation just messing about on here!<br /><br />Any stimulant ought be either used for study, work, and partying as amphetamine helps you drink and stay pretty level headed&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Moderation is the key.<br /><br />For me, Adderal&nbsp; is hard to get. Keep getting vendors who cancel orders! Only buying two tabs to test not 200 to scam!<br /><br />Amphetamine is Adderall and its got to be used with caution. USE it for something. Paint the house. Party. Try not to sit in and muse on stuff!<br /><br />Good luck&nbsp; ;D

				Gonna admit I only read part of the thread because my attention span is limited at this hour but what I did catch resembles an experience with someone I&#039;m close to so I urge you to be careful on Adderall.&nbsp; Someone who I interacted with recently was popping 4-6 30mg at a clip a few times a day and hit a psychosis on day 5.&nbsp; He though people were after him, I wanted him dead and hired snipers to kill him when he was hundred of miles away.&nbsp; It starts off with not giving a fuck and doing out of the ordinary thing but can lead to something worse.&nbsp; Granted it only happens to 2.18% of people, but I hope you know your limits and it doesn&#039;t happen to you.&nbsp; I may be cautious at times, but being cautious is better than the alternative.

				tl;dr, will read later... but @captjack: a lot of amphetamines&#039; negative effects are strongly tied to poor nutrition and sleep deprivation !

				I honestly am surpirsed anybody would read this. I just had to write down all my experiences so the thoughts wouldn&#039;t go to waste. <br /><br />after I wrote that, the halucinations started. The reflection of&nbsp; my monitor showed a flamingo-lamp-crane-sneaking up on my. Objects seemed to vibrate and move. That seemed to be particulalry vivid, as a piece of bread was vibrating a moving around, and flakes were falling off of it. Hearing footsteps and seeing people walking in the corner of my eye. Numerous times, i heard a cartoon spring go off.

				ive gone a straight 48 hours (before, not now) without the assistance of adderall (at least for the marathon part).<br /><br />ie: ring ring - 7am, eat an shit, take adderall, work lunch*, eat lunch, take addderall, work dinner*, do my run/wotd, stay up all night, morning jog, errands, goto work for dinner, come home, watch a movie, stay up all night, pass out in the wee hours of the morning.<br /><br />it wasn&#039;t that cool. there&#039;s the two demons that always say: &quot;stay up and get something done&quot; and &quot;goto bed, you feel like shit already&quot;<br /><br />... i never get anything done, but i always feel like a bag of shit :D<br /><br />* intermittent coffeeffeez
