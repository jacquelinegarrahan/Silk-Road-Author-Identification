				Hello my friends,<br /><br />So, I&#039;m sure this is old news to many of you. But it is very present to Sasha and Ann. I&#039;m setting up a donation fund to help pay for his continuing medical and personal expenses. As most of you know dear Sasha Shulgin suffered a stroke in 2010. He recovered, but he has not been well. The last few months have been very tough for him an Ann. This is a couple that has changed all our lives. Deeply, spiritually, sexually, primally, and yes my fellow vendors, financially. They have broken open the shell of our psyches and showed us mirrors of ourselves and the vast uncountable planes of the universe. Sasha has bent time. Space. Colors. Geometries. Smiles. Friends. More Friends. And subjected and objected the world to a new host of amazing compounds.<br /><br />So...this last month, friends from the academic, artistic, and (ahem) shall we say psychonaut community set up an auction of fantastic blotter art on ebay to help raise some funds. They raised several thousand dollars. Which in american medical terms is enough for a couple aspirin and a wheelchair ride to the door. I think we can do better. I have put up a bunch. I want to put up more.<br /><br />Give this man some money. Look people, for everything they have done for the world they should be able to live out the end of their days in wealth and happiness. And we are a community. A community which in part would not be in existence (kowtow DPR, sorry) were it not for this amazing man. They have given so much to our youth, please, let us give something to their age.<br /><br />So just maybe, that hit of X this week could go to the woman that introduced it to the world. That 2C-whatever, could go to the guy that invented it. And to my colleges (my friends, my compatriots), maybe your **k this month could get shorted a few hundred dollars. This would be magical, and would have a real impact on the persons who have truly changed our days and nights these so many years (none of you youngsters now; ok youngsters too). But money is not all. Warm wishes and sincerity are always appreciated to an aging legend looking back on his adventures and smiling upon the new faces that blossom in his wake (it wouldn&#039;t be cool to drop his address here, but it&#039;s easy to find, and yes he reads them). <br /><br />Ok, my rant is done. I have already sent money to this extraordinaire and I will do so again. I want to raise at least 10k. There&#039;s a lot of us so it would be easy. Oh, I almost forgot. Sorry my people for my&nbsp; slowness a month or so ago. From what I hear everyone&#039;s getting there stuff and the reship already went out. Don&#039;t give me the extra money. It&#039;s cool. Please give it to Sasha and Ann. They need and deserve it more than I (&quot;grumble grumble&quot; in the background from my peeps I&#039;ve owed cigarettes to for a week). &quot;Oh,&quot; I say to them. &quot;Guess what.&quot; You just surrendered 5% of your check next week.&quot; (Honestly, I don&#039;t pay in cash or checks, only DMT, but trust me it&#039;s coming out of their collective asses). Oh man. Bubbling humor in the wake of (what 2C was it?). So msg me for the BTC addy. I&#039;ll shoot it to you as I didn&#039;t think it wise or prudent to post it here. I will run this for two weeks and then I&#039;ll have someone less emotional than myself (sniff sniff), transfer it to the Shulgin donation account. Please give. Let us affect some people who matter to us as a community. Thanks my friends.<br /><br />Peace, Entropy, and Love,<br /><br />DiMiTri <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Respect for putting this up dude.<br /><br />This guy is a king - pioneered the mainstream MDMA synth, invented the 2c series - in other words if it wasn&#039;t for this guy, the 90s wouldn&#039;t have been the 90s.<br /><br />I can spare a few BTC next time I cash into mtgox, so PM me that address man. <br /><br />I think any mdma/2c vendors should definitely put into this. I mean, you wouldn&#039;t be making the profits you are now if it wasn&#039;t for these two. And will you really notice $20-30 disappearing? <br /><br />But.. I don&#039;t doubt you, the love is clearly present, but is there any way of proving that you&#039;re actually donating this to the fund? With the whole tony76 I am lot less trusting - and 10k is a lot, who knows you might get coked up and decide to do a runner

That&#039;s kind of you. I&#039;ll PM you the address. I don&#039;t know who tony76 is, but I don&#039;t do coke and I&#039;ve been around along time. Plus I&#039;ve already contacted two moderators on Silk and they know what I&#039;m doing. If they would be kind enough to watch over the account I have established or take over administrator control that would be even better. I&#039;m not that kind of person. Just trying to help some people who have helped me. Peace.

				I was just reading something about Shulgin and the Pickard bust a week ago. Next time I make a purchase, I will be sure to throw a few coins his way. At the very least, the man deserves to live comfortably for all the work he&#039;s done.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This guy is a king - pioneered the mainstream MDMA synth, invented the 2c series - in other words if it wasn&#039;t for this guy, the 90s wouldn&#039;t have been the 90s.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Don&#039;t remind me! The 90s were the shit. Not just for that reason either. I&#039;m about to donate to some old 90s bands and cartoon makers.. it&#039;s the least I can do to repay them for making the 90s an awesome time to grow up.<br />

				There is a documentary about the Shulgins called Dirty Pictures. You can find it on torrent websites and it&#039;s probably on Youtube in parts. Everyone involved in the drug community owes it to themselves to watch it and learn about the Shulgins.<br /><br />Requesting that BTC address.<br /><br />EDIT: Apparently there&#039;s a unrelated docudrama by the same name that came out in 2000. You want the 2010/11 documentary. http://dirtypicturesthefilm.com/

				hi everybody<br /><br />as far as i understand there are still problems with Sasha&#039;s health. His friend Greg Manning keep raising money to support him and i believe all of us should take part. you can get all the information in Greg&#039;s journal here - http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/shura/journal, posted on&nbsp; Sep 19, 2012 1:24pm <br /><br />i think if each of us will send him a few bucks it will be enough to make his life a little bit easier

				Wow I feel so incredibly ashamed.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know he had a stroke in 2010 and is in poor health.<br /><br />This man is one of the two most prolific and influential men that I LOOK UP TO AS HEROES and I didn&#039;t even keep up with this information?&nbsp; <br />Fuck me I feel like dirt (the other man in case you&#039;re wondering is Richard Feynman, but he&#039;s already dead, so meh)<br /><br />He took a stand against an overwhelming force (law enforcement) by giving them absolutely no recourse but to not only allow, but to FUND him (he worked on several &#039;defense&#039; ... read military projects involving cannibinoid analogs and was considered by all in the DoD, DEA, etc. as a contributive to their cause, and a kind man) instead of locking him away in prison.<br /><br />It takes balls to do what he did (consume every analog he produced and write detailed reports on them.&nbsp; No ... typical organic chemist would consume their own synthetic product, led alone hundreds of them).&nbsp; It also takes balls to take the stand of (trying to) change the social wind of in this case the usage of psychotropic drugs in society.<br /><br />I will definitely be donating to him right now, and fuck do I feel like a complete bumbling ass.

How the fuck did I miss that the had a stroke more than two years ago?! :&#039;(<br />He and Ann are working on a third book and he is making more tryptamines (MALT, NALT, EALT, PALT and iso-PALT and their 5-MeO substituted versions). We definitely haven&#039;t seen the last of them but they need all the support they can get. I&#039;m going to donate to them as soon as I can.

				They should accept btc on their website. It would make it easier for people to donate. I&#039;m not saying it is hard to use Paypal, but vendors sitting on an excess of btc might be more inclined to send a few anonymous btc than Paypal cash. Maybe we can organize a sitewide donation drive. We&#039;ll solicit all the MDMA, 2C-x, 5-MeO-x, etc.,. vendors. <br /><br />Shulgiin is a true hero. He deserves more credit and love, specially from this community.
