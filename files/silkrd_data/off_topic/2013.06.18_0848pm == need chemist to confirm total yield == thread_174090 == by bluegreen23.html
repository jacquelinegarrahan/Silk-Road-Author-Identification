				Exactly what the title says. anyone with experience feel free to weigh in.<br /><br />100 L sas<br />200L methanol<br />1kg pladium2chloride<br />75kg benzoquinone<br />200L dcm<br />200L HCL aqueous<br /><br />what should the total yield be roughly?

				You don&#039;t got a detailed synth method where this is mentioned? It should be in the Erowid Rhodium archive...

				I can only base this on small scale lab synths, yields tend to go south when working with large quantities. If you are careful with your methods and patient you should get near to the yields I describe below. I will be basing this purely on the amount of sassafras you have available as including everything else turns into a lot of math. My yields are based on typical routes of synthesis. <br /><br />Synthesis<br />Benzoquinone Wacker Oxidation <br />Reductive Amination of MDP2P with Al/Hg + Nitromethane<br /><br /><br />Yields:<br />Safrole from distillation typical 70% - 70L<br />Wacker Oxidation Safrole to MDP-2P typical 65% - 45.5L<br />MDP2P density 1.2g cm3 - 54.6Kg<br />Reductive Amination of MDP2P with Al/Hg + Nitromethane typical 80% - 43.6Kg MDMA<br /><br />Depending on country of origin you are looking at a street price of around 2,600,000$ or at current exchange rates 24914 bitcoin =D<br />

Therefore your numbers are slightly off, but I agree in theory with everything stated.<br /><br />Also yields are done by weight or by mol, not by volume.<br /><br />And your numbers are off on the third step by a factor of ten.<br /><br />Imo your final yield should be about 50kg.<br /><br />It will take a LONG time, though, unless you&#039;ve got a superlab. But check back in 10 years when you&#039;re done. I&#039;d love to hear how it went.

				Well there we go. Decimal in the wrong spot. Now it all makes sense.<br /><br />There is no way that it would be 4.6kg but 46.3kg makes sense. I know that it was going to be above 40kg. <br /><br />As for time, 2 days. That&#039;s what it takes. <br /><br />And big thank you to all involved in the thread here. Greatly appreciate the outside verification.

				I wish it was mine.&nbsp; :)<br />Rent on the lab is everything over 40kg, and the precursors are provided by the renter. Thats why I was curious as to what was expected. The lab owner/worker isn&#039;t very liberal with information about how much over 40kg they expect, but now I know what to expect. <br /><br />Thanks again guys. Appreciate the info.

				P2P is correct, I lost a decimal somewhere. Yield would be 46Kg. <br /><br />Corrected my first post.
