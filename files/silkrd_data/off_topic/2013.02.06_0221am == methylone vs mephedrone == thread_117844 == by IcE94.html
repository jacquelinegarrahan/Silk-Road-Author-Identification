				Yeah I think you&#039;re going to have a hard time finding something to replace the MDMA. It&#039;s sort of the king at capturing those feelings and everything else out there just gets little bits and pieces of it without ever really nailing it.<br /><br />If you just want to mix it up a little, the only thing that is going to put you in the same ball park is going to be MDA but if you are taking a break from MDMA that&#039;s not going to be of much help for you. The two are so closely related that they are both likely to fry your brain in about the same way even though my experience has been MDA hits me when my MDMA tolerance is already pretty high.<br /><br />For other alternatives, I kind of like 2CB on it&#039;s own but my girlfriend isn&#039;t a big fan so your millage may vary. 2CB gives a nice little body high at low doses (&gt;10mg) and some pretty cool visual effects at higher doses (&lt;20mg). Not the same body high as MDMA for sure, but fun and it keeps the brain pretty clearheaded which is neat. I&#039;ve heard good things about the other 2C-X&#039;s so some research along those lines might be useful. <br /><br />Just played with some Moxy for the first time last night at it wasn&#039;t bad. Felt nice, little rushes of body energy, but the load was kind of high, felt a little more stim like than I normally go for.<br /><br />Mephadrone might get you closer to where you are looking to go but a lot of people take it thinking it&#039;s going to be like MDMA and it&#039;s just not at all like MDMA.<br /><br />Honestly if you just want to hold onto that MDMA like magic I would just take a break from MDMA and move onto other drugs of exploration like LSD / Shrooms / DMT / Ketamine and make MDMA one of those few and far between sorts of adventures. If you alternate between MDA and MDMA, you&#039;ll end up having some fun, albeit different adventures that might keep things interesting for you. <br /><br />Anyway, good luck to you! Hope you find what you&#039;re looking for!<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				thanks diamond thats pretty much exactly what i was looking for.&nbsp; havent tried any of the 2-c&#039;s but will definitely look into those, been dabbling in some mxe and may just stick with that for the moment since i only need small amounts and a gram lasts forever.<br /><br />and no interest in developing (another) stim habit so il be staying away from the meph lol

Some of the 2C&#039;s can be a little less forgiving but 2CB seems to be pretty gentle. The low dose gets you a little pick me up body high and it 100% functional while the higher dose gets some pretty neat visual side effects going on. The weirdest thing about it, and the reason I don&#039;t drop it too far into the psychedelic category, is just because while on high doses, watching the world melt, bend, shift and transform around me, I am still completely in my head. The visuals are more like watching a television show than being in the show if that makes sense. If you mix it up with something that has a little mood elevation / disassociation like even just pot it can get a little more interesting, although pot also ups the visuals a notch too.<br /><br />I tried a little GHB last night for the first time, just a trial dose of 1.5g mixed in with some water and it was a little mood lifting but I didn&#039;t really feel any unique euphoria or anything that would make me want more. As others have mentioned, it seems similar to taking a shot or two without the pure drunkenness that comes along with it. I&#039;m going to give a few more measured doses a try again this weekend and see if a bigger buzz can be found in the stuff before it makes me pass out, lots of people say great things about this stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, lots of stuff out there to try but don&#039;t be afraid to take a break from the stuff for a while either. I like to go on good long binges and then take months or even a years off in between. Sounds totally lame but hitting up the gym and eating good wholesome food for a a while is a pretty amazing high on it&#039;s own. As is falling in love with some new hot chick that you meet while going out and doing all those things&nbsp; :) After a little time off coming back to the chemical highs can be like watching the perfect sunset for the first time all over again. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br /><br />
