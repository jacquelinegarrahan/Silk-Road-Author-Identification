				Hi there,<br /><br />I was wondering if anyone has a good knowledge on medical use of cannabis?<br /><br />My parents are getting old and i can&#039;t stand seeing them taking various highly addicting pills for treating their pain in stead of a natural medicine like marijuana...<br /><br />One of them suffers of chronic pain in the neck and back due to an accident he had by felling from 7 meters in 1.20m of water and rocks when he was young. <br /><br />Tying to impress his friends, he saw a guy jumping from the cliff and getting out of the water on his feet with no problems. So he tried to do the same and missed... A helicopter took him to the hospital and all that shit... Hopefully he&#039;s got a lot of luck because even with a broken vertebra he can still do work like masonry and all that but suffers...<br /><br />He is used to be in pain but he takes benzos and he get&#039;s annoyed easily also... He has medicine for that.<br /><br />But my objective is to prove them that they don&#039;t need to be part of the scandalous french anti-depressants/benzo industry... Just with weed they can get better without eating pills every day ! (maybe?)<br /><br />Just need some advice, how to treat them? which dosage ? Giving them tinctures, edibles, even making them smoking but they don&#039;t really like that idea. Once i made him try to smoke and he ended on the floor vomiting :P<br /><br />I warned him to not smoke more than 3/4 puffs for the first time but he smoked it all in 2 minutes .... like a cigarette ....<br /><br /><br />I already made him grow weed for me but he managed to let the timer on 24h/24h during flowering period and all the plants are dead lol <br /><br />He didn&#039;t pay attention as he looked after them only at night when the lights where supposed to be on. Although he&#039;s done well for a first timer old guy with no knowledge to get them to flowering period ! <br /><br />Just to say that they are enough open minded to probably have a successful treatment.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and FUCK french government propaganda/lies/prohibition ! LE-GA-LIZE-IT !!!!!!!! <br />

				There are DEFINITELY members on here with the knowledge you are seeking.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact the mod of this topic DigitalAlch is the one I would talk to first.<br />Props to&nbsp; you for getting your elderly parents off of all the pills that &quot;old people&quot; seem to be prescribed and looking for a more natural way.&nbsp; Sounds like a great way to start the new year.
