				What amazes me is that most of your ancestors left Europe to get away from oppression and tyrannical governments and now, in the 21st century,&nbsp; your government is way more tyrannical than anything we have in Western Europe.

				They even put provisions in your constitution to arm the populous to keep the government in check.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think its time for you guys to hands the guns back, all you guys seem to use them for is robbing convenience stores and shooting up schools.&nbsp; What is the point giving every citizen the right to bear arms if your own government can get away with spying on you in broad daylight?
