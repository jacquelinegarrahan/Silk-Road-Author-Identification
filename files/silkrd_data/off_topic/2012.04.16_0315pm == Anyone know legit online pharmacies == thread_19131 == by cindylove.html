				http://www.nubrain.com/ is a good place to get modafinil or selegiline - but the prices aren&#039;t as good as SR - they ship from the US.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t used http://www.top10medsonline.com/shop/ yet, but they look promising <br /><br />Do you mind sharing any reliable benzo sites maynard? It would be nice to find a place with affordable Adderall, the SR prices are a bit too high for me.

				Thanks for the replies. I am looking for prescription stimulants like Dextroamphetamine, Adderall, Ritalin etc. These are hard to find for a good price on SR or they won&#039;t deliver outside US/CAN/EU. I need a site that can deliver internationally.<br /><br />Also, how do I spot if a review site is a shill?<br /><br />Thanks

				Pharmacy Reviewer is okay, I used to use Drugbuyers until it went down. There is a new Drugbuyers I think, but it is totally a scam. The only way to use any site is to read the forums carefully. I wouldn&#039;t buy anything here until I read and read and read some more. Same applies at PR. If a pharmacy is in trouble you can often tell by the reviews starting to sound a bit off. Half the people would panic and the other half would pray. It woud become more and more confusing and in the end people would lose money. Not too dif from what happens here.

				Anyone on here from PR?? Havent been there in a while but it was a nice pace while it lasted. The convo got too redundant for me after a while... and to the OP there are ALOT and I mean ALOT of online pharmacies that have great quality meds and at very cheap prices you just have to know where to look. I wont tell you becaise I feel it undermines SR if I got posting links to other sources but Ill give you a hint nonetheless..... google pharmacy reviewer from there its on you to research research and research some more. I think I put a good two months of research into it before I got all the legit connects.
