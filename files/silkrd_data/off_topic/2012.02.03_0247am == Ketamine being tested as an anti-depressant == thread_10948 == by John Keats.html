				We live in exciting times. The FDA is currently processing a request for the approval of MDMA as a treatment drug for PTSD, according to a friend who is a psychiatrist. LSD and Iboga are also the stars of several human trials on depression, cluster headaches, PTSD, several addictions (most notable alcohol, heroin and gambling), schizophrenia and OCD. After over fifty years on pause, it&#039;s great to see these substances back into the mainstream of medical research.

				i actually went as far as ordering some Ketamine here on SR to see if it could help me with my depression, but after i received it i did some research on what kind of effects this drug can have on a person, and i don&#039;t think i&#039;m ready for k-holes and out of body experiences.&nbsp; that all sounds kinda scary to me.&nbsp;

I need about 60mg intramuscular or 300mg insufflated to get to a k-hole. if I take less than that, I won&#039;t lose my body at all.

				but if you take a lower dose will it still be as effective for depression?

My suggestion to you is this: try a low dose a couple of times. if it doesn&#039;t help, then progress towards a k-hole. <br /><br />I understand that it seems very scary when described, but it isn&#039;t really. You don&#039;t so much &quot;lose&quot; or &quot;exit&quot; your body as you do forget you ever had one for a while. You become (in your own perception) a sort of free-floating consciousness. This allows you to cut away from heavy emotional states and &quot;rest from being yourself&quot; for the duration of the trip (quotation marks because it&#039;s only an approximate description of what I mean). It&#039;s hard to describe, but I wouldn&#039;t qualify it as scary.
