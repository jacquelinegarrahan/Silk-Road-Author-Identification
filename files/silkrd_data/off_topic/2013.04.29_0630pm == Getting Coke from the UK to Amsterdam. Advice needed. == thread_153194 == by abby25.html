				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m flying to Amsterdam for a weekend at the end of May, and i am keen to take 3-4g of C with me. I&#039;ve been to Amsterdam many times and have no desire to buy Coke from the dodgy dealers on the street, and really don&#039;t have enough time to be searching around for a connect, so i either need to take it with me or post it over there.<br /><br />I am staying in an apartment so i think it would be fairly easy to get the address and post it from the UK to&nbsp; Holland, but that obviously has it&#039;s own risks such as it being seized or lost in the mail.<br /><br />I have thought about just taking it with me but not sure of the best way to get it through the airport. Flights inside the EU are very rarely over the top with security....most of the time you just walk on and off the plane, but i obviously want to be as careful as possible so any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br />What do you think is my best option?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br />

				I agree, taking cocaine (or any drugs) on the plain is the dumbest you can do.<br />You double the chances of getting caught: at UK airport and NL airport. Moreover getting caught redhanded with cocaine on you will have much more severe consequences than having ur parcel lost or even intercepted. <br />even if they would intercept it, you prolly have nothing to worry about.. nobody ever has unless it&#039;s bulk amounts (which it isn&#039;t in this case); furthermore there are theoretically no borders within the EU so the chance it&#039;s intercepted is super small. Just send it with some inventive stealth or as said, order from NL through SR.

				I am also considering a short break in Amsterdam and have considered your situation. I think the best option by far would be to get an address sorted over there - and get one of the EU vendors to sort you out. I have never bought of an NL vendor as the chances of an intercept must be a little higher. There is a great vendor in Germany who get my parcels to UK in 2 days, so would have thought NL would be even easier.<br /><br />Anyway good luck &amp; let us know what you decide to do as I will be out there myself shortly and will be asking the same question!! :)<br /><br />

				Post from UK to NL using another vendor&#039;s stealth.&nbsp; Order from C63 domestically.&nbsp; His stealth is top and it is domestic.&nbsp; Trying to get support for bringing coke on your person from the UK through the ferry/airport is not going to happen.&nbsp; Also why order from a German vendor and risk international customs, albeit a small risk.&nbsp; Domestic post is not checked.&nbsp; You have a month to research the Dutch vendors.

				Hi there,<br /><br />I regularly travel with small quantities of drugs (Ketamine, occasionally pills) from the UK to NL, France, Spain without any problems.&nbsp; I double bag, stick it in a Kinder Surprise egg, wrap a condom over it and stick that up my ass.

				Fair enough.&nbsp; Read one of the recent posts in the cocaine thread by Chil.&nbsp; Gotta be up to date with c63&#039;s coke batches.&nbsp; In your mouth is also another option and only needed when going through checkpoints.&nbsp; The truth is, you most likely will never be caught smuggling small amounts in to Holland.&nbsp; But why take the risk these days knowing how packages can make it the opposite way in 2 days. Good luck mate and let us know how it goes next month.

				I&#039;ve been to amsterdam with people that have taken a q of coke with with them, snorted it in the toilets at gatwick, looked a mess all the way to boarding the flight...on the way back they still had more than half of it left so they bought it back with them, again snorting it in the toilets at schipol, drinking heavily and acting rowdy. Was so sure they were going to get pulled over but nothing happened.<br />&nbsp;<br />Those fuckers sketched me out so much I didn&#039;t even bring back any weed with me....weed is one thing I always try to bring back with me on a flight from dam, never ever been pulled and never expect to. Most I managed was 20 grams and I made no attempt to cover the smell, just had it in my jacket that I was wearing

				Hello Everybody,<br /><br /><br />We are working on SR for longer than a year now and the site went down for 5-7days a few months ago and came back up and running even better then before.<br /><br />Everybody wants SR to run smooth both buyers and sellers and therefor we have to give the whole Sr staff the time that they need to secure and renew the site whenever necessary. <br />Keep in mind that they are also losing money every day that SR is offline and people cant access there accounts, so they will do everything in there power and even beyond that to get SR up and running again ASAP.<br /><br />i don&#039;t have a good view on the other markets that are operating but my advice to everybody that&#039;s been messaging me about going to other markets is to wait until SR is back up and have faith in the community.<br />Because going to a different market will not mean that it will not have the same problems. (The Grass Looks Always Greener At The Neighbors)<br /><br /><br />There is a holiday at the moment in Holland so not one vendor from NL can ship packages today.<br /><br /><br />The BTC price is fluctuating strong at the moment and is very vulnerable.<br />Some people are loosing money the same hour that they bought Btc and others are making profit.<br /><br />For all the people that lost a lot of money in the last few days or weeks, there is going to be a compensating in the form of discount on most of our listings for at least 2 weeks so that everybody can smile again.<br />When SR is online there will be more info about the discounts.<br /><br /><br />Too all the SR members from USA and AU we will switch all of our listing from europion union to shipping worldwide in 1-2week give us some time to adjust a few things to operate successful thru the account c63amg because working with a second account and more people can cause a lot of headache.

After a few minutes, you won&#039;t be able to feel it. I avoid main UK airports where there may be body scanner and I&#039;ve never had any trouble. Most of the people I know do it this way and none of us have had any trouble.&nbsp; Obviously, you take your own responsibilities and I am only sharing my own experience.
