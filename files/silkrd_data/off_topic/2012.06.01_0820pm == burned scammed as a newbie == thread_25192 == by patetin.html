				You going to tell us who allegedly burnt you?<br />What did you buy? <br /><br />And why would they be laughing at you? SR isn&#039;t as dodgy as you think. I was a newb here three weeks ago and have had nothing but the most positive buying experience.

He may have a genuine reason.<br />But I can kinda relate to what you posted. I brought some coke from a guy here, and it was the worst cut stuff I had ever done. I mean just awful. Fortunately for me the guy refunded me all my money which was a good thing for him to do. Maybe its something smiler with your guy? Ie; Not a scam, but a rip-off.

Is it better to get burned scammed fxxxxd up the arse robbed cheated ?<br />I hope there&#039;s a change to get some refund.. I mean it was a non amelling no vinegar tasting no acetic nothing and when you cook it it leaves some sticky sxxt on the sxxxn and it&#039;s.. nothing.. So, ok - seller is not a user he does not know his merch but this makes no sense.. and he does have a good feedback.. I have read the fb before placing an order.. should I trust SR ?

Sorry to hear you got ripped off though dude. Stuff that like is going to happen though, i mean this is the black market.. but 95% of sellers are genuine, honest people.

				<br /><br />Dude, so you finalized before trying it? It says explicitly in the buyer&#039;s guide not to do that. If you follow the guide your chances of getting burned are almost nil.<br /><br />So is this a regular seller of H? If he is he should have his own vendor thread. Did you look there to see what others are saying about his stuff? What about the general H vendor thread? The forums are really the only place you could demand a modicum of accountability if you finalize before sampling your purchase, although your chances are greatly diminished it&#039;s worth a shot. And don&#039;t be shy about blasting his name if he sent you bunk on his vendor thread.
