				Whats up guys, i&#039;m thinking of doing a hippy flip for 4/20 this coming friday&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never hippy flipped but i&#039;ve taken shrooms and molly before as well as a much longer list of drugs.<br /><br />I should have some of galindoi&#039;s cubes by next week and i have some defqons and am waiting on some mdma from super trips.<br /><br />My plan is to eat 3.5grams of cubes (been about a year since i had a proper shrooms trip) and around a month since i last had mdma.<br /><br />Would you reccomend 3.5 grams and 1 defqon? 2 defqons? or maybe if any of you have tried both the defqons and ST&#039;s molly would the molly go better? is 3.5 grams 2 much to mix with mdma for a first time hippy flipper? I am looking for a intense but not overdoing it trip that turns bad. I know taking both these substances will produce much stronger effects.<br /><br />Also at what time would you say i should do them. Mushrooms first then mdma? or other way around?<br /><br />I was thinking like 2 hours into my shrooms to drop a defqon or something. <br /><br />Any input would be awesome as i want to stay safe but have a great time with this new drug venture. Should be awesome tho<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Cuba!!

				Cuba,<br />&nbsp; You are about to have some FUUUUUUUN.<br /><br />&nbsp;Here is the deal. The Molly is going to keep the fear away.. and all the bad vibes too. These are more prevalent with acid.. but mushies can get them too.. if you do enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;So.. do your Molly first.. then hit the mushies HARD. do LOTS. the Molly will keep you in a good place. Then supplement as needed through the trip.<br />If you can spare it.. be sure and crush one of your defqons and divvy it up into tiny lines. Then bump with them to enhance any OEV you may get from the mushies.<br /><br />&nbsp;Enjoy it.. Hippy flipping is SOOOO much fun.

				nah.. the Molly and mushies will play off each other. Each will go on longer due to the presence of the other. Chances are good they will both sync up and trail off about the same time.<br /><br />Remember.. it&#039;s not just pharmacology and blood concentration profiles.. it&#039;s about heart-medicine and soul as well. <br /><br />Also I know this may sound silly and mystic.. but put your mushies and your MDMA together in the same bag or container in a good place, something significant for you. Let them absorb the good vibes together (however you would quantify or express that).<br /><br />&nbsp;My trip spends time at Buddha&#039;s feet on the little shrine for several days before I do it. However you sacralize your journey.. do that. It will pay dividends!

				3.5-4 grams mushies yeah. If your defqons are legit E then I would take one by mouth and have the other crushed to do lil bumps off of. If you have powdered Molly already then bump off of that later on.<br /><br />The two should potentiate each other nicely to put you in a happy shroomy space.
