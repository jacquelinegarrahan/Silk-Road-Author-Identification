				Not really, I&#039;m happier out of a warzone on the whole. <br /><br />Seriously though has anyone been keeping up with this in the news and seen the big politician that has defected from the Assad Regime, it&#039;s on channel 4 news now (U.K T.V). <br /><br />Would anyone care to speculate how this is going to play out? I can&#039;t see Assad&#039;s forced holding out much longer.

				Well what isn&#039;t reported by western media is that the Assad regime still have huge support from alot of Syrian residents, which is perhaps why they are desperately clinging on...<br /><br />Also they are pretty confident that foreign powers will not interfere like in Libya and certainly not to the extent as in Afghanistan or Iraq as Syria have a big, powerful military, including a sophisticated airforce.<br /><br />So with the knowledge that they have a big support base in the people, as well as the fact that foreign powers will not get involved on a military level, the regime knows that basically whoever wins the civil war will take/keep control of the country. So I think they&#039;re like &quot;fuck it&quot; lets just try and win it as quickly as possible regardless of war crimes/human rights abuses.

				Yeah I think the FSA will come through eventually though, it&#039;s all part of the Arab Spring. Wonder what the body count will be by the time it&#039;s all over, I do fee for the Syrians that are effected by Assad&#039;s terror tactics. It&#039;s a disgrace.

				You should come over to the Verbal Diarrhea thread, it&#039;s the new cooler version of Chat More Shit. <br /><br />The irony is if Assad just had a democratic Priminster-position he could have kept the hereditary Presidency anyway and looked all the better for it. Completely unneeded.

				Syrian people are the nicest people ever, this is really sad to see and I can&#039;t imagine how it&#039;s going to play out with any degree of certainty. Assad will fall at some point but it&#039;s unfortunately got a bloody path to some sort of solution. I&#039;ve not paid much attention recently because of Curiosity and the Olympics but the UN need to do something, like a no-fly zone. Sanctions and finger-pointing aren&#039;t very effective. :( I hope it turns out like Libya and Damascus is liberated within a month.<br /><br />I&#039;m not necessarily for the FSA, but Assad has to go.

				I doubt it will go on much longer. The only people still supporting the regime are people too close to Assad to dissent. Many of them are afraid of being killed if they switch sides. Good for the rebels, though.

However their downside is their defense because the back row can&#039;t come up with anything better than &quot;Yeah....errrr....there arrre some terrorists....YEAH THAT&#039;S RIGHT, TERRORISTS! They are the ones that are killing civilians, definitely not us. Oh and these terrorists are armed, definitely armed.....with government issue tanks and heavy weapons. No that isn&#039;t &#039;Syrian Army&#039; stamped on there....it says &#039;Syrian Farmers&#039; but it&#039;s scratched.....totes true guys FOR REALZ!&quot;<br /><br />However if you gun for FC Free Syrian Army (no the Syrian Farmers) you generally agree with non-standard uniforms, webcasts about freedom and liberalism and videos of the shit you pull off on camera phones. When the war is over however you will probably forgo these revolutionary beliefs to a more bent and corrupt form of politics and we shall rinse and repeat and start over.<br /><br />A tough decision if there ever was one!

I am not attempting to disrespect anyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m not real hot on mincing political ideologies because they are all different perspectives on how to best organize the idea of &#039;state&#039; and how best to manifest the qualities that help to create &#039;order&#039; Religion is similar because it is used as a type of &#039;remote control socialism&#039; without all of the accoutrements, but it is long on dogma. How does that reflect the topic?<br /><br />What we see unfolding in Syria is no different than the numerous destabilizations that make up America&#039;s history. If you study it enough you can see the blueprint in the events as they play out. I am familiar with how American NGOs are used to make inroads to nations set up for &#039;regime change&#039;, or as I like to view it central banking/multinational corp. &#039;reconstruction&#039; and realignment to a resource harvesting operation. They maximize harvesting resources with whatever necessary benefits they have to extend to the population while extracting as much from that nation as they can.<br /><br />Syria is the current target of America and Izrahell. What I think is so brutally ironic is that America, Al-CIAduh, and Izrahell are ALL in agreement with the destabilization of Syria. That means all three are on the same side. Al-Qaeda!?!? The group we are supposed to believe attacked America. Al-Qaeda as a group of &#039;Muslim radicals bent on global jihad or domination&#039; is a complete farce. Al-Qaeda is a covert operation that is more correctly identified as Al-CIAduh. The insurgents are armed, trained, and supported by the United States and they have gone from nation to nation destroying the governments so that they might be &#039;reformed&#039; in a more palatable, sympathetic version.

I despise religion and the political party hair-splitting that makes people believe that because they associate themselves with this group they are immune from the stupidity their ignorance is responsible for.

Are we really so naive as to believe that we will keep the wolves at bay through obedience, passivity, and appeasement?

Do we realize the amount and degree of the propaganda that we consume and process and what the goal of it is? We live in a world where a relatively small group of people keep the majority on life support and anesthetized just enough to keep the system alive. <br /><br />&#039;Fight&#039;? I&#039;m so god damn tired of &#039;the way things are&#039; I&#039;m ready for a change.

				I have a good friend who is from (and lives in) Homs, Syria and I get to speak to him every once in awhile, when they actually get working internet.

People automatically think that America is about &#039;freeing people&#039;. How fucking condescending. Like America is high on the list of FREE states. Free is such a objective word. I used to be a strong supporter of the Palestinian issue until I realized people around the world aren&#039;t in a much better position. The same thing that keeps Palestinians from being represented by people that have their REAL interests in mind aren&#039;t confined to Izrahell. Something about being ruled by &#039;absentee owners&#039; gets under a person&#039;s skin.

I&#039;d like to know your thoughts on the matter. It is a documented historical fact that multinationals use paramilitary groups to eradicate dissent. Globalizing profit industries doesn&#039;t even rate an intelligent response but you start talking about globalizing labor and immediately you are called a communist. Yet, how is it that although we may be worlds apart we have more in common with each other than we do the so called politicians that claim to represent us?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=34332.msg397637#msg397637">Quote from: Limetless on August 09, 2012, 04:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I quite like Israel, they are surrounded by enemies and don&#039;t take any shit, more power to them.

They are chickenshits that practice an ideology identical to Nazism except that a few key points are superficially different. There was no difference between Mein Kampf and Der Judenstaat. They are both a supremacist forms of nationalism. If the world wasn&#039;t so god damn drunk on the religious kool-aid they might take the time to notice that America is pouring BILLIONS of dollars into a extremist poltico-religious extremist group that has no regard for anyone else or &#039;peace&#039; as they are led to believe. I wouldn&#039;t dream of trying to change your mind, but you sure a fuck couldn&#039;t convince me that the shit they pull makes them anything but bare boned, chicken shit cowards that hide like a bunch of bitches behind their religious zealots and cry every time someone bitch slaps them into their place. And fuck all that &#039;bad ass military&#039; shit. They are pussies and the ability to kick my ass to the nth degree doesn&#039;t change the FACTS.
