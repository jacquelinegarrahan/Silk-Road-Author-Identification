				Hey, all. After spending the last few years experimenting with various substances with some friends, one thing that has fascinated me is how different drugs do vastly different things to different people. While one person smokes weed and proclaims it the most horrible paranoia-inducing experience of his life, his friend smokes a bowl and says he&#039;d be content to become a mellow stoner for the rest of his days. Not four threads down from this one at the time of this writing is a thread detailing how someone finds MXE better than K, when a lot of people love the hell out of K. <br /><br />When I first started using drugs, I thought everyone felt roughly the same after using any specific drug. It became evident that this was not the case when my friends and I would sit at the table and smoke pot, each of them laughing about any number of things, while I was unable to even make the mental connection between multiple sentences, let alone find things hilarious. I learned that while drunk, I kept my mental state intact far more than my physical state, stumbling around despite feeling mostly myself, while my friends seemed to do the opposite. Based on how a couple friends had their personalities warped after using heroin for several months. I originally assumed the &#039;harder&#039; drugs led down a road that always led to addiction, and almost certain loss. I was surprised to find that, for myself, I am more mentally drawn to drugs like pot and ecstasy. While I do enjoy heroin every now and then, I can tell it doesn&#039;t make me feel nearly as good as it makes one of my friends feel, who claims it&#039;s the best feeling in the world.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious about a few things about the community. Feel free to answer any questions in any way you wish.<br /><br />What is your favorite drug?<br />How does it make you feel?<br />What is your drug that you find &quot;most tame&quot; or best used on a regular basis? (if any?)<br />How do you view your fellow [IRL] drug users&#039; reactions to drugs while using? Do they act goofier, happier, more stoned, etc. than you while under the drug&#039;s effects? <br />What drugs that induce euphoria or release dopamine (or whatever- drugs whose effects include making you feel good/happy) make you feel the best? <br /><br />Share any other information regarding specifics as to your drugs experiences and how they make you feel. For instance, assuming you&#039;ve done both, how does an LSD trip compare to mushrooms? Which do you prefer, and why? Do you think it&#039;s because of your need to maintain or lose mental control during a trip, desire to commit to an 8 hour journey vs. a 4 hour journey, etc.?<br /><br />Finally, what factors do you think cause different experiences, from person to person? Is it because of one&#039;s inherent distrusting personality that he becomes paranoid while stoned, or perhaps his dopamine regulation is a tad off? Perhaps both reasons, with one reason causing the other?<br /><br />A specific drug does not simply lead to one specific set of emotions, chemicals releases, visual changes, etc. Rather it&#039;s like anything else in life- movies, games, fine wine... we each experience them a little different, and based on a number of factors, we like them more or less than others. <br /><br />-Edited a bit after coming down from an empath, original post was a bit goofy and it kept on rambling.-

				What is your favorite drug?<br />Either MDMA or Oxymorphone<br /><br />How does it make you feel?<br /><br />MDMA(In roll form) - The best description I&#039;ve come up with for this drug is the hand of God picking you up, God proceeding to kiss you on the forehead and then throw you through the clouds. But in all reality, it feels like an all-body orgasm that comes in waves, the trough still feeling incredible and the peak indescribable.<br />Oxymorphone(40mg ER&#039;s) - Extremely relaxed and euphoric, happy with everything! But I only use sparingly to avoid addiction.<br /><br />What is your drug that you find &quot;most tame&quot; or best used on a regular basis?<br />I&#039;m not really a regular user of anything as I&#039;m not too fond of marijuana. If I had to say anything I&#039;d say painkillers but I never use them more than once a week.<br /><br />How do you view your fellow [IRL] drug users&#039; reactions to drugs while using? Do they act goofier, happier, more stoned, etc. than you while under the drug&#039;s effects?<br />Goofier and happier. Really depends on the experience and the drug itself. Mainly positive though, except for alcohol on occasion.<br /><br />What drugs that enduce euphoria or release dopamine (or whatever- drugs whose effects include making you feel good/happy) make you feel the best? <br />MDMA without a doubt.

				What is your favorite drug?<br />-LSD.<br /><br /><br />How does it make you feel?<br />-Like the world has turned into an oil painting! Everything is shiny and textured, with cool geometric patterns that move on certain surfaces. I also feel like I am &quot;one&quot; and &quot;connected&quot; with the universe, and that I somehow &quot;know&quot; what everything in life means. I feel deep appreciation for my family, friends, and everything that I have in my life and everything I have achieved. It&#039;s a mix of euphoria and enlightenment.<br /><br /><br />What is your drug that you find &quot;most tame&quot; or best used on a regular basis?<br />-Alcohol. Without strict moderation, however, alcohol can be seriously nightmarish - and alcohol may be one of the most difficult drugs to exercise &quot;moderation&quot; with.<br /><br /><br />How do you view your fellow [IRL] drug users&#039; reactions to drugs while using? Do they act goofier, happier, more stoned, etc. than you while under the drug&#039;s effects?<br />-I no longer take drugs with other people, so I&#039;ll draw on my observations from the past:<br /><br />-I love this comment from the OP: &quot;While one person smokes weed and proclaims it the most horrible paranoia-inducing experience of his life, his friend smokes a bowl and says he plans to be a mellow stoner for the rest of his days.&quot; That is EXACTLY what happened to me the first time I smoked pot at age 14! I absolutely loved it, became giggly, hungry, and sleepy. Whereas my friend became angry, paranoid, and irritable. I continued smoking for many years after that experience, but my friend never touched it again. Somewhere down the track, we ended our friendship due to a conflict of interests. However, after many years of abusing weed on an almost daily basis, I had to quit due to the same reasons described by the OP. The paranoia and anxiety I experienced whilst high became unbearable. I also started getting some weird auditory hallucinations and worried that I may have been developing psychosis.<br /><br />-I&#039;ve seen some people really freak out on acid, especially tweakers. Whereas I&#039;ve always just enjoyed exploring the philosophical train of thought, and looking at the OEVs.<br /><br />-MDMA always got me more &quot;fucked up&quot; than my friends, because I came into the scene much later than they did, so my tolerance levels were lower. After a while, though, the tolerance caught up with me, and most ecstasy pills were disappointing without several months&#039; break in between them. As the OP mentions, nothing can ever compare to the feeling you had the first time you tried it.<br /><br />-Alcohol affects me less than other people. I have a very large build and a very well developed tolerance from drinking heavily for many years (not healthy, I know). Friends are sometimes shocked at how much alcohol I can consume without seeming affected by it.<br /><br /><br />What drugs that enduce euphoria or release dopamine (or whatever- drugs whose effects include making you feel good/happy) make you feel the best?<br />-Definitely MDMA in terms of a purely euphoric experience. I prefer to the mind-expanding nature of LSD, though. I would probably love candyflipping and must put that on my &#039;to do&#039; list!<br /><br />-This was a cool idea for a post. Thanks to the OP! Looking forward to reading others&#039; responses.
