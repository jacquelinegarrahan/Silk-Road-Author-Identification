				unreal old dude sees 2 black guys he thinks coming out his neigbours house so he rings cops saying his neigbours been burgled he has a shot gun should he stop them.<br />the cop says no dont even think about dont go outside .so he goes outside and kills them both while there running 1 with 1 shot other with 2 <br />and the motherfuker gets away with it and the wierdo tea party class him as a hero <br />how the fuck was his life in danger when there un armed running away and he was in his house and cops told him to stay there .if they were white he wouldnt of assainated them <br />also had the trevon martin one which the guys now in court over and there was more outrage over that but the old guys was much more dodgy he was in no danger at all<br />if trevon was white he wouldnt of been followed either and the cops also told that idiot to not get out his car but he does anyway<br /><br />how can the west tell afghans and morrocans etc to stop growing plants theyve grown for 1000s years yet they can flood the world with guns fuckin scumbags <br />what a suprrise the corporations were making laws not

				They&#039;re stuck with guns now. No matter how many innocent people are killed by crazed lone gunmen, no matter how many people murder &#039;intruders&#039; for stepping onto their property, no matter how many young lives are needlessly taken, there aint no way americans are giving up their guns. The reason? They&#039;re all shit scared. Why are they all shit scared? Coz everyone&#039;s carrying guns (and so the cycle continues.....). Anyway, now that the conservatives (NRA included) have latched onto gun ownership as a constitutional right it aint gonna change.<br /><br />I&#039;m just fucking glad I love in the UK where 0.4 people per 100,000 die from guns every year as opposed to the USA where 15 per 100,000 die every year..Fuck em, let them stew in their own shite.
