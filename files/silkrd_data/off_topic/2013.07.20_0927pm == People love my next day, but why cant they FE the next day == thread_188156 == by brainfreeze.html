				Well the only answer to your question is; because people are 1.inconsiderate 2.unappreciative and 3.irresponsible. <br /><br />Im not a vendor on SR but i can totally understand where your coming from. You provided a said service, their end of the bargain is to release your payment in a timely fashion. <br /><br />The only option you really have to combat this issue, is make it a very clear point on your vendor page that when your DCN says delivered, the buyer has X amount of hours to finalize. Id say 24hrs is more than enough time , though in some cases people will not have access to a tor enabled computer for what ever reason. So maybe you would consider give maybe a 48 or 72hr deadline for finalization of paymet. <br /><br />You as a seller reserve the right have what ever terms and condition you so wish. If i where you, I would do as i said and give a deadline for finalization. Those who do not comply with the given terms and conditions would indefinitely be blacklisted as a buyer and i would no longer allow that person to make purchases from me. Best of luck.

Maybe type up an message that you send to people who order next day shipping as a confirmation about the FE thing? It may be a pain in the ass, but more of your customers might finalize quicker and get you the money you deserve.

				Have to agree completely......happens all the time.......I have it right at the top of my page........?being a good customer means finalizing within 24 hours of receiving your order&quot;........<br /><br />Still even with that 15% auto-finalize.... :(<br /><br />Then when they come back and want to order again....and can&#039;t figure why they have to FE........I remind them about their auto-finalize.

				100% agree.<br /><br />I always sell all my stuff before the next lot is ready, which means i can afford to be choosey who i do business with, and people who wait more than a week after products arrive to finalize go on my personal shit list, i will not sell to them again under any circumstances. I understand not everyone can afford to do this, after all sales are sales, but if more people did then maybe the buyers would lift their fucking game, like u i go to a lot of effort to get most of my orders delivered next day, 80% appreciate it and FE fast, 20% leave me hanging.<br /><br />All that being said, in legitimate businesses, you often wait months for customers to pay you, and have to bill them 40 fucking times, or threaten them with legal action. I think around 20% of the population are just self involved cunts, and always will be.

				Totally agree with this one. most customers are good people that do the right thing but the few that don&#039;t finalize are annoying. I send my orders out quickly and its only fair that the buyers should be expected to do the same. For this reason it would be great if buyers had feedback as well. <br /><br />

				If I am ordering something from a vendor I have before or something that is easily identifable as real like pharma, then I finalize that day.&nbsp; If it needs to be tested, it may be the next day or day after but there is no reason it should be longer than 48 hours unless the buyer had an emergency like the death of an immediate family member or something.

				some people don&#039;t log in very often. sometimes if there&#039;s an issue with their address for example and you send them a pm you may have to wait a week for the reply. then they log out before you&#039;ve had the chance to reply. a bit frustrating. there are quite a few autofinalisers too

				As a buyer I always finalize as I come in from the mail..what I buy I know if its ok when I open it, and I order from the same vendor. <br /><br />It would just be shitty of me to wait to finalize..I am always waiting, know its coming and am happy as hell to receive my purchase ... the best way to show the vendor my appreciation is to pay them..<br /><br />I can understand the wanting to be sure its not bunk, but that still wouldnt be more then a day or so..auto finalize just without some major outages of the site or something just sounds like someone who lacks empathy and or appreciation for the vendors.

				Don&#039;t understand it either. Takes me usually no more than an hour after i have received package. My only guilt regarding this is sometimes i am too high or lazy to leave thorough feedback. Sometimes it&#039;s just; &quot;great product! And fast!, but the main thing is making sure vendor gets paid asap.
