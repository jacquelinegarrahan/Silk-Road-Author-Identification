				It was bound to happen eventually. I&#039;m interested to see if it keeps dropping over the next few days or if this was just a bunch of speculators dumping their coins quickly.

				Hang onto your coins, it was just a DDoS on MtGox, the market will correct its self soon, just don;t panic buy and make sure you use an exchange other than MtGox, their monopoly needs to end soon for the good of us all.

If I had a car I could have bought at 120 and bought things online for 200+ but i couldn&#039;t get to them quick enough and ended up buying for 170ish and having a bit more on SR. Still worth it. Going back up.

				BTC is supposed to be a decentralized currency, that;s where its strength is. All it takes is for Gox to be taken down for widespread panic and chaos across the economy. Gox handle 80% of all transactions, In my opinion that&#039;s dangerous for bitcoins. Personally I have access to enough computers to DDoS Gox into oblivion, and there are many many many sys admins, hackers and botnet operators who could do this also.<br />Gox is bad for bitcoin and a hazard to the whole economy
