				Alright, guys.&nbsp; I&#039;ve burnt out every single freakin&#039; artist I can think of and pretty much decimated dubstep for me, along with electro.&nbsp; Huge fan of music like Umphrey&#039;s McGee, The Offspring, any sort of dubstep and electro (except skrillex, cannot stand him), moe., pretty much any famous classic rock artist, ESPECIALLY Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and just so much shit...&nbsp; I need new suggestions.&nbsp; I love chilled out music the most.&nbsp; Willing to take any suggestions on any genre.&nbsp; If you suggest an artist, make sure you let me know of an album in particular too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t usually listen to individual songs.&nbsp; I either listen to a set, an entire album in full, or live performances in full.<br /><br />Once again, I&#039;m interested in just about every genre.&nbsp; Just need some new ideas.

				This isnt very ... &quot; Chill &quot; But its very motivational &quot; The Word Alive - Life Cycles &quot;<br /><br />Sleeping with sirens CD: &quot; If you were a movie this would be your soundtrack &quot;<br /><br />For All Those Sleeping - &quot; Follow my Voice &quot; <br /><br />Idk, something about music that sings about bettering life, and fighting for your own cause just tickles my fancy i suppose.<br /><br />You could also listen to Never Shout Never, very easy listening, great songs ( even some about drugs )

Its the type of music you either hate or love.<br /><br />If you like Dubstep, check out old school D&#039;n&#039;B like Aphrodite, Fabio &amp; Grooverider, Goldie and LTJ Bukem just to name a few.

				I&#039;d highly recommend an album called &#039;Bloom&#039; by a band called Beach House. It is very chilled and floaty. Enjoy.<br /><br />Also, The&nbsp; Chromatics have an album called &#039;Kill for Love&#039;. This is very chilled out also ;)
