				&quot;An Australian drug dealer has become the first person to be convicted of a Silk Road-related crime, after using the black marketplace to buy a stash of MDMA, amphetamine, marijuana and cocaine.<br /><br />Paul Leslie Howard used Silk Road to buy and import the illicit drugs on 11 different occasions. Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officers in Melbourne and Sydney examined mail -- most of which came from the Netherlands and Germany -- destined for his home. They found 46.9 grammes of MDMA and 14.5 grammes of cocaine. The federal police then raided his house in July 2012 and found digital scales, ziplock bags, $2,300 (Â£2,000) in cash, 35 stun guns disguised as mobile phones and a money counter. They also found two working mobile phones, and forensically analysed more than 20,000 text messages. In amongst them were incriminating texts such as &quot;I got five grand worth if you want&quot; and &quot;promote the LSD I got more in. I sold 200 cubes last week&quot;.<br /><br />Howard has pleaded guilty to two charges of &quot;importing a marketable quantity of a border-controlled drug&quot;, which carries a maximum jail term of 25 years. He also pleaded guilty to possessing controlled weapons. During the trial he said that he had been drawn to the site after reading an article by a journalist called Eileen Ormsby, who regularly covers the Silk Road in Australian newspapers. Since Howard&#039;s conviction, the Silk Road has warned its users via its Twitter account not to follow their feed nor the feed of Ormsby with their real names. <br /><br />*****<br />Prosecutor Morgan Brown made it clear that the authorities had a lot of information about Howard from the Silk Road, including access to his profile, which he registered under the name Shadh1 in April 2012. He set up a vendor&#039;s account offering up cocaine and speed and saying that he is looking to &quot;branch into more as I get more coin back in my pocket&quot;.<br />*****<br /><br /><br />So, Shadh1 goes down.<br /><br />Farken Pigs.

				I think having read the article they plucked some low hanging fruit, it&#039;s hardly a &#039;crack down&#039;.<br /><br />Never good to see anyone&#039;s life destroyed but complacency doesn&#039;t even come close to describing how this guy went about things.

				Well, part of the problem is the damned aussie government. Their border control is tyrannical. Even with OK stealth they are OCD about drugs reaching their country.<br /><br />The other half is this guy was not a big-time vendor, and was probably sloppy.<br /><br />Although the aussie border controllers are pretty bad, that&#039;s no excuse. Vendors, you are more than drug dealers, everyone&#039;s watching!

				It would be a safe bet the packages that got seized he ordered via Silk Road, this was the reason why they raided his house in first place from looking at the court case. <br /><br />I can see this happening to a lot of people here as they think they are beyond getting caught ordering drugs from behind a keyboard and don&#039;t even take the simplist of precautions. In his case PGP wouldn&#039;t have saved the buyers as once the cops got hold of his PC it doesn&#039;t appear he was using an encrypted drive so they would easily got hold of his private key and his SR account as they found and&nbsp; used posts he made on the forums here as evidence against him. You just got to hope he didn&#039;t record any address&#039;s for them to find. It just goes to show the weakest link in any transaction is going to be a sloppy vendor so have this in mind before ordering, especially bulk amounts..

				This not only demonstrates that you can get busted ordering drugs (which only idiots have ever denied), but also demonstrates the advantage of having a fake ID box. The thing is, any people this guy sold to here are going to be a little worried now. Sure they used GPG maybe and the feds cannot get their addresses unless the busted vendor didn&#039;t wipe the encrypted messages + gives up his passphrase. But the ones who got shit ordered to fake ID boxes would rest easily as they could just drop the boxes and get new ones. They announced the dudes vending name, so we all know who it was and who needs to be a bit on the safe side for a while.

				I never did any business with Shadh1, however, those that did should be concerned for the fact that this bloke showed the Police how to use his SR Vendor&#039;s account and how he operated on SR. Knowing this, it&#039;s more than possible he has given away details which should never have seen the light of day. Some disturbing facts are - <br /><br /># - He had posted his GPG PRIVATE KEY on his vendor&#039;s homepage as well as his Public Key. Despite numerous warnings to remove it, he never did. This means for sure the Police had access to GPG on his computer.<br /># - Knowing he stored photos of drugs with his vending name written on a piece of paper in the photo, in a folder named SR using Dropbox, is as silly as it gets.<br /># - The fact of him using his real name to order drugs to his own home is nuts!<br /><br />Journalist OzFreelancer, a member here, has more details on this story on her website - http://allthingsvice.com/2013/02/05/when-a-journo-becomes-the-story/#more-332

				Well, lets see, multiple packages coming in from out of country, many were already seized that contained shit, packages still keep coming in from out of country containing shit they find, they go to the house and he&#039;s got all his business right there, incriminating as hell.&nbsp; He got busted?&nbsp; That was an accident waiting to happen.&nbsp; It sucks for him, but think about it, he was so wide open with shit, they just go to the house and there it is.&nbsp; If he had a different address he ran the business out of and had some anti-surveillance set up, he could have denied some shit and possibly walked away wiping the sweat off his brow.&nbsp; How could you not know your getting hot when multiple packages are seized?&nbsp; I mean really.

				Probably using too much of his own gear Davey Jones.<br /><br />But what I find more alarming than anything..... anybody notice the comparison between his Silk Road username and his custom number plate on his BMW?<br /><br />Wow. Just wow. This guy simply takes stupidity to a whole new level. And then not only that, but he also gives police his login details only to further incriminate himself and others which of whom he&#039;s dealt with on the road?<br /><br />The only thing missing here is a bumper sticker on his luxury BMW which he&#039;d never be able to legally afford saying &quot;Sponsored by Silk Road&quot;
