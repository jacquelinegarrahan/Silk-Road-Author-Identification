				Yea but also this place was SWARMED with trolls afterwards. People were making tons and tons of new shitty accounts making threads about how unsafe SR is and how DPR is scamming us all filled with fallacies and newer members were freaking out about it. <br /><br />Then limitless became a mod lol.<br /><br />I also miss Mr. Dank.

				10 months later i can say this....<br /><br />a week after tony was OBVIOUSLY gone... i recieved an order from him. I had placed it 3 days before his sale prices popped up, won 200$ during the sale, and wrote it off...<br /><br />It showed up around april 29th or so,&nbsp; i was shocked and never posted on the forums, thinking that other reputable members who had placed orders would be getting something evernutally from him. it was .2 over too. <br /><br />weird.<br />

				To me there is no contest in that Mr.Dank was one of the funniest and craziest bastards on this website. He never even had very many customers his review thread was mostly people complaining about him and some even trying scare him by saying they were LEO and going to order. <br /><br />He used to send weed to people in unvacummed sealed tins if I remember correctly.

				Didn&#039;t surprise me when Tony76 pulled that scam. SR was smaller a year ago and that was about the time that a lot of the larger vendors began disappearing (think Pharmville, i still miss them haha).&nbsp; I never bought from Tony, but he was doing quite a lot of business, and something had to give.&nbsp; He had to either quit while he was ahead, or wait to get busted.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say I blame him for what he did, but it was still a dick move
