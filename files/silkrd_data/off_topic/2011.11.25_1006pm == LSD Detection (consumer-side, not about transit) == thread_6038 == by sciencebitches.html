				I tried searching a bit and didn&#039;t find anything one this:&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t plan on taking a hit of the stuff I just bought until a week from now and I want to finalize my order, but I also want to confirm the presence of LSD on the blotter, I pose this question:&nbsp; Is there an easy way, or something I can buy, to detect the LSD?

				LSD shines under a blacklight. it isn&#039;t a 100% test, but if it doesn&#039;t glow, you know it isn&#039;t LSD. Are the hits you got white or do they have a print?

				I have about 20 Ehrlich reagent tests I&#039;m about to put up for sale. I&#039;m thinking $10 each. <br /><br />Check back soon or contact me directly via SR.

				Someone knows how to ask lots of questions, but it doesn&#039;t prove he knows anything.<br />If you shine UV on your LSD all you&#039;re going to get is weaker LSD.<br />Black light makes any white paper shine like crazy.<br />Look at teeth, or some chicks bra strap in a club.<br /><br />Sam is just trolling hard.&nbsp; He&#039;s good at google, I&#039;ll give him that.

				Thanks PC... I think I will test that out.<br /><br />The only LSD testing I&#039;ve ever done is the taste test.&nbsp; ;)

				LOLZ@SAM<br />No, I would buy from a trusted vendor, and test it by dropping it.&nbsp; The ehrlich&#039;s will only tell you if there is the presence of an ergot derivative, so I wouldn&#039;t bother with it as it could be an RC just as easily.<br />I wouldn&#039;t bother with a UV test either, because it&#039;s about as reliable as waving your arms around and praying to the gods.<br />Send it to a lab to get tested with chromatography, that&#039;s the only real way to be sure, if you&#039;re so afraid.<br />I trust TheMunchies, and a few other vendors.&nbsp; There are few RCs that can come close to what that Munchies stuff is like.&nbsp; Look at the size of his blotters too, they&#039;re tiny, but pack a decent punch.<br />There&#039;s no real point in worrying and pissing on every vendor Sam. If you&#039;re such an authority, why don&#039;t you put up, or shut up.<br />

				Sigh.&nbsp; This is the last I post in this thread, no more feeding the troll.&nbsp; This is your final meal.<br /><br />Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometry is bar none the best way to test.&nbsp; Too expensive if you&#039;re just a buyer, but if you&#039;re selling large quantities, it would make sense to have this done and provide the results in a pic with your seller ID in the listing.<br /><br />UV will fluoresce in the presence of a good number of different chems.<br />Hell If I shipped YOU some NBOME I would be sue to swab it with a UV marker so you would think its real and back me up on the forums. That ink will go back into solution and fluoresce too.&nbsp; Hell, buy a bottle of plain tonic water (Canada Dry or Schweppes) and shine your light on it... that shit will fluoresce all on its own due to the quinine content.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a vendor why wouldn&#039;t you just post with your account if you&#039;re trying to do the LSD community such a big favour?&nbsp; Seems to me, if you were a vendor with such great knowledge it would only improve your business.&nbsp; However, you just keep trollin&#039;.&nbsp; Maybe you&#039;re afraid to reveal your vendor account because you&#039;ve threatened to expose certain buyers addresses in the past?<br /><br />LSD crystal is actually luminescent on its own if nearly pure, and if you give it a stir in the dark it makes an awfully pretty little light show.&nbsp; There is a difference between luminescence and fluorescence.<br />I know they&#039;re both big words that have similar syllables, but not the same definition.<br /><br />The ehrlichs test will only test for the presence of an indole alkaloid... which can mean MANY substances, psychotropic or not.&nbsp; This includes DMT, Psilocybin, and even tryptophan for crissakes.<br />Read some of Shulgins work to see just how many indole alkaloids he&#039;s used to make tryptamines in TiHKaL.<br />You just cannot admin when you&#039;re wrong.&nbsp; If you give me proof that you have a test that will cheaply identify only the presence of LSD I will eat Digital Arch&#039;s hat.
