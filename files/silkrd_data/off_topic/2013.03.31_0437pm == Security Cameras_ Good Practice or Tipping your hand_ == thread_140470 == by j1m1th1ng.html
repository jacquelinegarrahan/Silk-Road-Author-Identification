				Pretty much topic. I have several security cameras as part of my setup. Does anyone but people upto shady activities in an average middle class community use these? Or does this just advertise that I am upto something?

				It might tip off low lifes who will think you have alot of money/valuables. altho as long as you have good security system they cant really do much unless they try to rob/mug you outside your house..<br />Have you ever considered getting hidden security cameras, that arent so obvious that they are cameras?

				We disguise our outdoor cameras.&nbsp; You can&#039;t see them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, this advertises you are up to no good if someone sees it.&nbsp; I also notice people take offense when they see them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I even record all day night and play back the clips to see who came to the door today and such . . . Great tool. Mine is viewable from my iphone remotely wherever I am.<br /><br />Pm me and I can show you the gear I got and where to get it cheap.&nbsp;

				Not to worried about a break in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if someone was able to get into the operations room I use a&nbsp; heavy duty safe bolted to the floor and all the cameras are at least somewhat hidden besides the one right outside the door. I guess for me the piece of mind that no one can approach the area without me seeing&nbsp; is worth th the payoff and neighbors think I run my eBay/amazon biz out of the facility.

				Yes to what the other 2 said. Cameras are great and can save your ass, but not if they are obviously visible.
