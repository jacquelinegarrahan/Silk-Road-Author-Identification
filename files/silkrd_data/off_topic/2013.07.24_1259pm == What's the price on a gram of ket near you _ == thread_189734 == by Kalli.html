				Hey the SR community I was just wondering what the prices are elsewhere on &quot;the streets&quot;<br /><br />I have recently been buying small amounts (quarters) and selling a few bags to make my personal stuff cheaper, after purchasing from 2 local dealers 1st we weighed both and 1 was 0.7 and the other 0.6 both cost 20 pound and neither of them were great quality.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing 0.8 for 20&#039;s and just wondered if this was fair and even though they don&#039;t weigh a gram everyone still calls them grams.... a bit like the eighths of weed round here I suppose.<br /><br />Thanks for your time, kalli.

				people dont even do that shit where i am. its weed, coke or mdma. people in the city where i live tho, do that shit all the time. 60 a gram even though its not good quality, its like mdma down here people just dont know what it costs or there getting it from some retard who only looking to make money not get repeat customers. i sell my grams for 40 to anyone i dont care who because once they do it and talk to some other people they will know what a deal they are getting an can even resell if they would like.

				if you were cool with it you could be raking in the cash and set up someone around you to sell. or do it yourself. if there are people around you paying 200 for a gram and you have access to it for 30 - 40 at the most then why would you just sit there and let this good times pass you by lol
