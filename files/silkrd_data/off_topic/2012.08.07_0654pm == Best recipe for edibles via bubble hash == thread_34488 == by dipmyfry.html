				I have about an oz to spare and would like to turn it into cookies, brownies, etc.&nbsp; Was in search of a dank recipe/method(s) to go about extracting/making some space treats from any experienced true ganja men or women.&nbsp; I was thinking about using butter and coconut oil, any suggestions ?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				just follow *any* recipe that requires either oil, melted butter, or both. <br />It&#039;s up to you, search the desired recipes on allrecipes or something.<br />and as for which is better - for melting the hash they&#039;re both the same, and taste depends on the recipe. <br />

				I prefer weed-food that is small and rich (in flavor and THC).&nbsp; Tiny cupcakes.&nbsp; Small brownies.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are selling these items through the post, you will need to make sure that your confections are shelf-stable.&nbsp; You do this by reducing the moisture content, and by ensuring that the ratio of sugar to everything else is kept high (~ %20, iirc).&nbsp;

				Thanks for the info yall! <br />I ended up making some with only coconut oil. Turned out pretty well put about 3teaspoons of oil and 2.6grams of potent hash. It did leave some darker parts in the oil tho. Does the hash usually all end up together at the bottem of the final product in the oil?&nbsp; I used the double boiler method for about 3hrs in vapor water heat only [Tried some was really dank. <br /><br />Now i am left with the question how much coconut oil should i use for 2ozs of dank hash?&nbsp; I will be eating all this i have smoked to much in the past and would like to take it orally instead of having to smoke.

Dont know if that was a good idea or not regarding the fact that i can burn some of my hash. i will do it at a low simmer this time tho my friends, any other suggestions? (i will be using only coconut oil and hash)&nbsp; I wish to make the dankest of the dank on this one ;)
