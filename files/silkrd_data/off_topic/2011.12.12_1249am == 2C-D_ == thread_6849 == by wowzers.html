				Has anyone tried it? I&#039;ve heard all sort of conflicting stuff about this compound and as it seems to be quite rare I&#039;m never sure whose trip reports to believe. I always discount most of the trip reports on erowid and bluelighters can be slightly implausible at times. <br />So if you&#039;ve tried it:<br /><br />What sort of dose is sensible? <br />How visual is it and are the visuals &#039;digital&#039; like 2C-B or more evolving and organic like mushrooms?<br />What&#039;s it like on the heart/ bp/ vasoconstriction?<br />What&#039;s the psychological aspect of it like?<br /><br />&#039;I&#039;m not quite reconciled with how fucking weird the deep end of a mushroom trip can be (losing touch with, or maybe getting a deeper understanding, of, the nature of reality and time, internalizing the trip). I&#039;ve heard the 2C&#039;s are less headfucky than tryptamines, and my experiences with 2C-B seem to bear this out.<br /><br /><br />Also, I&#039;m planning on trying 2C-C soon and would be similarly interested in any of your experiences.<br /><br />Cheers

I took 60mg and I literally have never been so fucked in my life. I had to leave a tiesto concert because I was tripping so hard.<br /><br />2c-D is the most full fledged trip of any 2c. It may not be as potent by weight but it is the most potent by effect. <br /><br />Seriously....2c-d is fuuuuucking intense.

				I&#039;m interested in trying 2c-d as well. However it sounds like something isn&#039;t right - comparing to Phikal entry. You sure you dosed it right&nbsp; ? - mind you Tiesto would give me a bad trip too. <br /><br />60mg is still a +++ which by Shulgin standards is going to be pretty intense....still he made it to 150mg ok.<br />Could you speak to people ok (that always a good indication 2c-d at 60 mg you should be able to communicate some what I would think) if its anything compared to what 25d is like maybe a party with lasers and flashing light and all that would cause confusion - too many thing going on at once which woudl fuck with the cone of focus 25d gives you....possibly having an adverse effect.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(with 10 mg) There is something going on, but it is subtle. I find that I can just slightly redirect my attention so that it applies more exactly to what I am doing. I feel that I can learn faster. This is a `smart&#039; pill!<br /><br />(with 20 mg) Butterflies in stomach whole time. OK. This is about the right level. In retrospect, not too interesting. Primarily a stimulant, not entirely physically pleasant. The visual is not too exciting. I am easily distracted. One line of thought to another. I feel that more would be too stimulating.<br /><br />(with 30 mg) I was into it quite quickly (not much over three-quarters of an hour) and got up to a ++ by the end of an hour. There is something unsatisfactory about trying to classify this level. I had said that I was willing to increase the dose to a higher level, to break out of this not-quite-defined level into something psychedelic. But I may not want to go higher. Under different circumstances I would not mind trying it at a considerably lower dosage, perhaps at the 10 or 15 milligrams. I do not have a comfortable label on this material, yet.<br /><br />(with 45 mg) There was a rocket from the half-hour to the one and a half hour, from nothing up to a +++. Somehow the intimacy and the erotic never quite knit, and I feel that I am always waiting for the experience to come home. Talking is extremely easy, but something is missing. Appetite is good. I am down by the fifth hour, and sleep is comfortable. This compound will take some learning.<br /><br />(with 75 mg) This is a +++, but the emphasis is on talking, not on personal interacting. I am putting out, but my boundaries are intact. I was able to sleep at the sixth hour. Communication was excellent. This is fast on, but not too long lived. Maybe a therapy tool?<br /><br />(with 150 mg) A truly remarkable psychedelic, one which could compare favorably with 2C-B. There are intense colors, and I feel that more would be too much.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It was just obscenely scary and intense. I really don&#039;t know what I was thinking taking that much. I went a little too hard in the paint.
