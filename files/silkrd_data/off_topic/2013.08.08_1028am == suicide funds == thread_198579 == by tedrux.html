I mean, couldn&#039;t you just jump off a very tall building/ cliff, slit your wrists or hang yourself?<br /><br />So therefore I am guessing that yet again you&#039;re drunk and feeling a tad self-pitying, you&#039;re after attention. <br /><br />That&#039;s fine. Here&#039;s a virtual hug.

				Getting people on the internet to buy you cyanide isn&#039;t the only way to kill yourself as well you know. <br /><br />You&#039;re not serious, we all know that and my guess is you&#039;re jealous of all the other suicide threads. <br /><br />But that&#039;s ok, we all have our moments where we need attention. Get out of the situation you&#039;re in at the moment by going to volunteer in the Third World, google how to do it. <br /><br />Helping others is a very valid way of helping yourself.

Or maybe getting in the sea in the dead of night and just swimming and swimming until there was nothing left and I drowned or getting a fuckton of heroin and shooting it up. <br /><br />If you are truly serious though, the SR forums aren&#039;t the place for answers, you&#039;re just going to get trolled for the most part by people who are bored of these sort of threads.

And if you think digging through your forearm sounds hard... I couldn&#039;t imagine trying to hack away at your femoral artery with anything shy of a Katana. <br /><br />The Carotid artery would also be pretty absurd.&nbsp; Once you cut one side, you&#039;re instantly going to grab your throat to stop the flow, because of how fast, and because of the loss of the ability to breathe.&nbsp; You&#039;ll pass out before you&#039;ll die, and while unconscious... someone might just save your life. <br /><br />Takes about 2 minutes to empty the body&#039;s blood supply out of just one slashed Brachial, which is located just above the elbow, beneath your tricep muscle under some of the softest skin and fatty tissue in the body; it&#039;s easy to score the first slash too! <br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Well, I sure as fuck am not going to give you my hard earned money just so you can kill yourself. Plenty of people have killed themselves without begging for money first. In fact, I&#039;d say most people kill themselves BECAUSE they don&#039;t have any money, so it looks like you&#039;re on the right track there. But yeah, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re going to be getting anymore bitcoins from people, especially considering you still owe people money after you took advantage of their generosity in the spare coins thread.<br /><br />However, my offer still stands from your other thread where you posted about earning bitcoins.

				So fucking tired of these suicide threads. They&#039;re all clearly fake attention whoring posts. 2MarijuanaMan contradicted himself and showed he was lying about being crippled in another thread so his was fake, and I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve seen you post about it tedrux.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like an insensitive ass hole, DO IT YOU FUCKING PUSSY.

I agree on the Brachial, but it&#039;s not so easy to do as it is the carotid that&#039;s so evident and everybody know. I mean, someone that doesn&#039;t even have the competence or willingness to research on ways to die with the information so easily reached nowadays you think can find the Brachial artery even if a doctor would tell him where it is and marking it with a magic marker?<br /><br />The carotid artery is more than he deserves, at last he will shut up for some time if all else fails :P<br /><br />P.S: You are giving too many precise hints and methods to Tedrux; in this way he will possibly do it for real in the end and succeed, if not only for a mistake (as in: trying something willingly that doesn&#039;t work but his subconscious with the information received will instead apply a method that works and then bye bye Tedrux; he is fun I don&#039;t want him gone so soon) ;)

There are even more efficient methods but those will work the same.<br />I don&#039;t want to give you too many precise details because I don&#039;t think you really want to suicide yourself no matter if you believe it yourself. For example I said to you about Heroin but I did not specify how to do it well. Using Heroin will work but if you are really serious about doing a thing as this then you should be able for yourself to research more on the topic to understand how to do it with the less trouble and misfire. If you are not willingly to do this then it just shows that you aren&#039;t really serious no matter what you say (your acts shows reality much more than your words).<br /><br />You cannot expect people to give you precise information and details on how to end your life, because, speaking for myself, I would never take that responsibility on myself and apart this you cannot really expect people to do the work for you (and not only about suicide, about everything). If you want to do it I can give you a possible direction but it is your responsibility to research more on that direction to find specifics and even better methodologies to do the same thing or similar ones.<br /><br />C&#039;mon TedRux. From how much time are you here? It&#039;s possible that you never researched yourself upon the topic (there are countless threads even in clearnet about these things) so much that you still need to come here for help? Be serious please (and I say this with your best interest at hand): you are not yet sure about committing suicide, it is just an option because you seem to have nothing else, isn&#039;t it? But this is NOT willing to suicide yourself it is just the only option you see at the moment because you think you have nothing more. Isn&#039;t what I&#039;m saying the reality of the thing?

				One method of committing suicide I remember, was going to the top of a highrise in the middle of the city, tying a bungee cord around your feet, tying a piano string around your wrists and holding onto the top of your head(covered in superglue) with both hands as you jump off the building.&nbsp; When you reach the end of the chord, the whiplash will make the piano wire sever your neck, and your dismembered head will be staring at everyone on the sidewalk below.&nbsp; Guaranteed to put any kids in the vicinity in therapy for years!

				Most drugs, taken in large quantity, will induce vomiting. To prevent this, take one or two anti-histamine tablets (travel sickness, allergy, hay fever tablets, etc.) an hour before on a fairly empty stomach.<br /><br />If your poison of choice is in tablet form, swallow the first 20% as normal. (A larger quantity may induce vomiting or impede absorption.) Take the remainder with food or a strong alcohol, crushed or dissolved as appropriate; this will help the entire dose to hit your system at the same time. Alcohol helps dissolve the drugs, but don&#039;t drink any beforehand! Instead, wash the tablets down with vodka or a similar spirit, and then drink yourself silly while you&#039;re still conscious.<br /><br />To increase your odds of death, secure a large, airtight plastic bag over your head. Also consider securing a rubber band around your neck. This can bring your odds from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;almost certain,&quot; in case the drugs don&#039;t work as expected.<br /><br />Friday night is a good time to die, if you live alone--nobody will miss you until Monday morning. Bolt all the doors and windows, and tell your neighbors or friends that you&#039;ll be away. If you&#039;ve got a loyal dog, set it free--you just don&#039;t want to be featured on the nightly news as the chump whose dog dialed 9-1-1 and saved his life.<br /><br />Be aware that people who regularly use painkillers can develop a tolerance. Increase the dosage accordingly.<br /><br />Alcohol<br /><br />Dosage: Variable<br />Time To Die: About 8 hours<br />Availability: Wonderfully easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Unreliable<br />The Savvy Suicide: Drink it all at the same time, as quickly as possible. Will cause liver and kidney damage if &#039;rescued&#039; before death. Dosage is questionable.<br />Science Facts: Ingesting spirits as an enema is supposed to be a very quick way of absorbing alcohol; even better, inject it. Dosage varies according to method of ingestion, the individual&#039;s tolerance, and the health of the individual&#039;s liver.<br />So They Say: &quot;The fatal dose of pure alcohol in an average adult is 300-400 mL (750-1000 mL of 40% alcohol) if consumed in less than one hour. Apart from the effects of overdosage, death after alcohol consumption can occur as a result of choking on vomit while unconscious...Consequences such as liver damage occur after chronic consumption.&quot;<br /><br />Amobarbital <br />(amytal, amal, eunoctal, etamyl, stadadorm)<br />Dosage: 4.5 grams, typically ninety 50mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 minutes; death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Very reliable<br />The Savvy Suicide: More effective when used with an airtight bag over one&#039;s head and a rubber band around one&#039;s neck. Alcohol accelerates the process and increases reliability.<br /><br />Aspirin<br />Dosage: 20-30+ grams<br />Time To Die: Variable: hours to days<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Unreliable<br />The Savvy Suicide: Not recommended. Fatal dose varies wildly, could cause liver &amp; kidney damage instead of death. Too many cause vomiting. Overdose causes strange noises in your ears and projectile vomiting after about 10 hours. Medical help generally effective, so stay out of hospital for a couple of days. May cause bleeding in your stomach and/or upper intestines. To speed up absorption, take with sodium bicarbonate (bicarbonate of soda).<br /><br />Bleach<br />(also lye, drain cleaning fluids)<br />Dosage: One half to one liter<br />Time To Die: Variable: hours to days<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Uncertain<br />The Savvy Suicide: This method depends on your stomach corroding, thereby releasing stomach acids to destroy vital organs. A painful way to go.<br />So They Say: &quot;I have heard of people throwing themselves through plate glass windows in their death agonies after drinking lye.&quot;<br /><br />Butabarbital<br />(secbutobarbitone, butisol, ethnor)<br />Dosage: 3 grams, typically one hundred 30mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 minutes; death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Very reliable<br />The Savvy Suicide: More effective when used with an airtight bag over one&#039;s head and a rubber band around one&#039;s neck. Alcohol accelerates the process and increases reliability.<br /><br />Caffeine<br />Dosage: 20 grams<br />Time To Die: Unknown<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Without much data or secondhand accounts, the lethality of caffeine remains uncertain.<br />Science Facts: An average cup of coffee contains roughly 200 mg, as does one caffeine pill such as Vivarin.<br /><br />Carbon Monoxide<br />Dosage: 5% concentration<br />Time To Die: Minutes to hours<br />Availability: Easy to get: car exhaust, for one<br />Certain Death?: Fairly certain<br />The Savvy Suicide: Causes brain damage to survivors. Skin becomes fire engine red, making the coroner&#039;s job easy.<br />Science Facts: The actual cause of death is asphyxiation, since the carbon monoxide binds tighter to hemoglobin than oxygen does (the oxygen gets crowded out, so to speak). <br />So They Say: &quot;Urban legend tells of one couple who tried to kill themselves by filling their apartment with carbon monoxide. Unfortunately, the heavier-than-air carbon monoxide leaked through the floor and killed the people in the apartment below.&quot;<br /><br />Chloral Hydrate<br />(noctec, chloratex, somnox)<br />Dosage: More than 10 grams, typically more than twenty 500mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Chlorine gas<br />Dosage: Unknown<br />Time To Die: Unknown<br />Availability: Tricky<br />Certain Death?: Good<br />The Savvy Suicide: Used in World War One, known to be a very unpleasant death.<br /><br />Chloroform<br />Dosage: Unknown (a soaked rag?)<br />Time To Die: Several minutes<br />Availability: Fairly easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Unknown<br />The Savvy Suicide: Victim will become unconscious first, so steps must be taken to ensure a continued ingestion. Perhaps taping the soaked rag over one&#039;s mouth?<br /><br />Cocaine<br />Dosage: 1 ounce (?)<br />Time To Die: 2 to 3 hours (?)<br />Availability: Possibly difficult; very expensive<br />Certain Death?: Unknown<br />The Savvy Suicide: Cocaine overdose induces a heart attack. Along the way, expect severe paranoia and breathing problems. It is not uncommon for drug mules to swallow bags or condoms of cocaine, only to have them accidentally burst in transit, killing them quite handily.<br /><br />Codeine<br />Dosage: 2.4 grams, typically eight 30mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 minutes; death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Very reliable<br />The Savvy Suicide: More effective when used with an airtight bag over one&#039;s head and a rubber band around one&#039;s neck. Alcohol accelerates the process and increases reliability. Be warned than tolerance develops with &quot;normal&quot; use.<br /><br />Cyanide <br />(HCN, KCN)<br />Dosage: 50 mg Hydrogen Cyanide gas, 200-300 mg Cyanide salts<br />Time To Die: Seconds for gas; minutes for the salts on an empty stomach; possibly hours on a full stomach<br />Availability: Very difficult to secure<br />Certain Death?: Very certain<br />The Savvy Suicide: Instead of ingesting cyanide salt orally, drop 500mg into a strong acid. The fumes will be pure Hydrogen Cyanide, capable of killing within seconds.<br />Science Facts: Hydrocyanic acid is one of the most poisonous substances known; the inhalation of its fumes in high concentration will cause almost immediate death. Hydrogen cyanide acts by preventing the normal process of tissue oxidation and paralyzing the respiratory center in the brain. Most of the accidental cases are due to inhaling the fumes during a fumigating process. In the pure state it kills with great rapidity. Crystalline cyanides, such as potassium or sodium cyanide are equally poisonous, since they interact with the hydrochloric acid in the stomach to liberate hydrocyanic acid. This poison has been used for both homicide and suicide; in recent history, a number of European political figures carried vials of cyanide salt for emergency self-destruction and some used them. Death resulted from amounts of only a fraction of a gram. A concentration of 1 part in 500 of hydrogen cyanide gas is fatal. Allowable working concentration in most of the United States is 20 ppm. Two and one-half grains of liquid acid has killed. The acid acts fatally in about 15 minutes. The cyanide salts kill in several hours. The average dose of solution is 0.1 cc.<br />The Savvy Suicide: Stomach acids will react with Cyanide salts to form Hydrogen Cyanide, so an empty stomach is a great advantage.<br /><br />Diazepam <br />(valium, apozepam, aliseum, ducene)<br />Dosage: 500 milligrams, typically one hundred 5mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Unreliable<br />The Savvy Suicide: Not effective by itself. Mix with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Flurazepam <br />(dalmane, dalmadorm, niotal)<br />Dosage: 3 grams, typically one hundred 30mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Gasoline<br />(inhaled/injected)<br />Dosage: 20 ml (?)<br />Time To Die: Seconds/minutes<br />Availability: Very easy to get<br />Certain Death?: With correct dosage, a reliable method.<br />So They Say: &quot;You can also use propane or butane on a skin surface. Go stick your hand in a bucket of propane and see how many seconds you last...&quot;<br /><br />Gluthethimide <br />(doriden, doridene, glimid)<br />Dosage: 24 grams, typically forty eight 500mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Heroin<br />Dosage: 120 to 500 mg for non-users<br />Time To Die: Unknown<br />Availability: Difficult (and, like cocaine, expensive)<br />Certain Death?: Unknown<br />The Savvy Suicide: Combined with alcohol, a lethal dose might be reduced.<br /><br />Hydrazine<br />Dosage: As produced by reaction (see below)<br />Time To Die: Unknown (2 weeks?)<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Not known<br />Science Facts: Commonly produced by mixing a bottle of bleach and a bottle of ammonia. A fairly common way for illiterate cleaning people to accidentally kill themselves.<br />So They Say: &quot;Several years ago at my high school, one of the janitors innocently mixed together half a bottle of bleach with half a bottle of of ammonia in a small closet where the cleaning fluids were kept. He passed out due to the hydrazine gas released in the reaction between the two chemicals. This man was in agony for two weeks in an intensive care unit in a local hospital with the majority of the inside surface of his lungs damaged and untreatable before he got lucky and died.&quot;<br /><br />Hydromorphone <br />(dilaudid, pentagone)<br />Dosage: 100-200 milligrams, typically 50-100 2mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 minutes; death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Insulin<br />(injected)<br />Dosage: Unknown<br />Time To Die: Hours-days<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Reasonable<br />The Savvy Suicide: Rumored to be quite a pleasant way to go.<br /><br />Iron<br />Dosage: Unknown<br />Time To Die: Unknown<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Good<br />So They Say: &quot;It seems that iron pills oxidize in the stomach and eat a hole through it. The only reason I know this is that someone at my school just recently overdosed and died from this. It was ruled suicide since no person could accidentally take that many iron pills. They didn&#039;t say how many she took or how many it takes to kill yourself though.&quot;<br /><br />Malathion<br />(insecticide)<br />Dosage: A few bottles<br />Time To Die: 2 to 3 hours<br />Availability: Found commercially at large garden centers<br />Certain Death?: Unreliable<br />Science Facts: Dosage to knock off a rat is 1 gram per kilogram of body weight. If that ratio holds for an adult human, then acquiring the necessary amount might be too difficult. <br />The Savvy Suicide: Parathion is recommended as a better insecti-suicide.<br /><br />Meperidine <br />Dosage: 3.6 grams, typically 72 50mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconscious in 5-15 minutes, death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Meprobamate <br />(miltown, equanil)<br />Dosage: 45 grams, typically 112 400mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Mercury<br />(salts, soluble)<br />Dosage: 1 gram of salts<br />Time To Die: Unknown<br />Availability: Unknown<br />Certain Death?: Good<br />Science Facts: Contrary to popular opinion, pure mercury metal isn&#039;t all that poisonous. The soluble salts are, however. The &quot;mad hatter&quot; story refers to brain damage that hat makers used to get from using mercury salts.<br /><br />Methadone <br />(dolophine, adanon)<br />Dosage: 300 milligram, typically sixty 5mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconscious in 5-15 minutes, death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band. Tolerance develops with use.<br /><br />Methyprylon<br />Dosage: 15 grams, typically fifty 300mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Morphine<br />Dosage: 200 milligrams, typically fourteen 15mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 min.; death in 20-50 min.<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band. Tolerance develops with use.<br /><br />Nicotine<br />Dosage: 100g (?) extracted from tobacco; 40-60 mg pure<br />Time To Die: Several hours<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Fairly certain, given a large enough dose<br />The Savvy Suicide: Side effects include violent convulsions. The direct cause of death is respiratory failure. Smokers should use larger doses than non-smokers. Coma may set in before death.<br />So They Say: &quot;Soak 100 grams of tobacco for a few days. You get a brown mess. Strain off the tobacco, then simmer slowly until most of the liquid has gone, leaving about 2 teaspoons of brown treacle-like stuff. Add it to your night-time drink, and never wake up. Someone once said that 150 mg of pure nicotine would be fatal in seconds.&quot;<br /><br />Nitrogen gas<br />Dosage: Minimum: several liters, uncompressed<br />Time To Die: Minutes<br />Availability: Possible through plumbing or welding supplier<br />Certain Death?: Certain<br />Science Facts: While the victim dies from asphyxiation, it is not a lack of oxygen; rather an excess of carbon dioxide deals the lethal blow.<br /><br />Nitrous oxide<br />Dosage: Unknown<br />Time To Die: Minutes<br />Availability: Fairly easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Reasonable<br />The Savvy Suicide: Accidental deaths are not uncommon. Probably a pleasant way to go.<br /><br />Paracetamol <br />(acetaminophen)<br />Dosage: 15+ grams; 20+ recommended<br />Time To Die: Fatal damage occurs in 10 hours, but fatality will not occur for another 2 weeks<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Fairly reliable<br />Science Facts: Horrible side effects during the 2 week dying time, including acute toxic hepatitis, renal failure, cerebral oedema, intra-abdominal bleeding, aspiration pneumonia and hemophilia. Insufficient dose causes severe liver damage. Accidental deaths are very common. Besides vomiting and nausea, there are few, if any, side effects before the damage becomes fatal.<br /><br />Pentobarbital<br />Dosage: 3 grams, typically thirty 100mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 minutes, death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Very reliable with plastic bag and rubber band<br /><br />Phenobarbital <br />Dosage: 4.5 grams, typically 150 30mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Info not available<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Phosphine gas <br />(From Aluminum pesticide, ALP)<br />Dosage: 3 grams<br />Time To Die: About 2 hours<br />Availability: Difficult to get<br />Certain Death?: Very good<br />The Savvy Suicide: After severe vomiting, the victim loses consciousness, the blood vessels rupture and body cavities fill with blood. Some escape death because the efficacy of the gas decreases as the pill ages and is exposed to moisture.<br />Science Facts: There is no specific antidote to this, so a single 3-gram pill contains enough ALP, which produces lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact with hydrochloric acid or water in the stomach, to kill quite nicely.<br />So They Say: &quot;A common method for Indian villagers.&quot;<br />So They Say: &quot;One 3-gram tablet is enough to kill 10 people.&quot;<br /><br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dosage: Not known (20cc injected in a strong solution is recommended)<br />Time To Die: Seconds to minutes<br />Availability: Widely available<br />Certain Death?: Certain<br />Science Facts: Causes heart attack, leading to sometimes ambiguous coroner reports. <br />Science Facts: An excess of K+ in the blood interferes with nerve signals and stops muscles and nerves from working. When it reaches your heart, you&#039;re finished.<br /><br />Propoxyphene <br />(darvon, dolotard, abalgin, antalvic, depronal)<br />Dosage: 2 grams, typically thirty 65mg tablets<br />Time To Die: About one hour<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Fairly certain<br />The Savvy Suicide: This does not make you unconscious. It is suggested that you combine this drug with a sleeping pill and the bad/rubber band rig.<br /><br />Secobarbital<br />(quinalbarbitone, seconal, immenox, dormona, secogen)<br />Dosage: 4.5 grams, typically forty five 100mg tablets<br />Time To Die: Unconsciousness in 5-15 minutes, death in 20-50 minutes<br />Availability: Prescription only<br />Certain Death?: Not effective by itself<br />The Savvy Suicide: Mix it with alcohol and restrict breathing with a bag and rubber band.<br /><br />Warfarin <br />(Rat poison)<br />Dosage: Unknown<br />Time To Die: Hours to fatal damage; days to actual fatality<br />Availability: Easy to get<br />Certain Death?: Very certain<br />Science Facts: According to speculation, this poison functions by causing severe a cerebral hemorrhage, since it kills rats by inducing hemophilia. Medical help is said to be futile; victims are left to die in agony. Skeptics dismiss this as melodramatic claptrap, citing the good health and ordinary lives of human hemophiliacs.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s so many ways to top yourself. But something (the fact that you haven&#039;t done it yet) tells me you&#039;re never going to really kill yourself. And that&#039;s a good thing Teddy. You&#039;re actually quite entertaining in your own little way. It sounds to me like you&#039;re quite young and my suggestion is that you get out there into the big wide world and chase some tail. Don&#039;t mention suicide to chicks, it comes off as a bit needy. Oh and remember no means no, if not it comes off as a bit rapey.

				Silk Road, the place where you can buy most kinds of drugs, is not the place to buy cyanide. <br /><br />Also with Remediless on calling bullshit on this whole thread. <br /><br /><br />In the slight chance that you are serious, the world is your oyster now. Are you &quot;broken?&quot; Possibly, but aren&#039;t we all?<br /><br />And why does that even matter? Now you can go do whatever your body wants. You have no relationships? Why is that a problem? Some/many find themselves trapped in so many relationships they long for the days they could up and go wherever they wanted, whenever, for no reason but because they need a change of scenery. And don&#039;t start in with the &quot;I&#039;m too old/I&#039;m too young,&quot; because age doesn&#039;t matter when you&#039;re increasing your chance of mortality to 100%. <br /><br />The only thing that matters is that now that you&#039;re facing that certain possibility of death, no other risk should matter. Exploring a volcano or wrestling a shark are somewhere less than 100% chance of dying, so why not try something you&#039;ve never tried before - for that matter, why not do something NO ONE has tried before?<br /><br />You are the ultimate candidate to do whatever the fuck you want to see happen in the world.
