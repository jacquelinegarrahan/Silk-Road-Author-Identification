				Greetings and Salutations fellow travelers. I am having foot surgery Oct. 25th. My r foot has been broken since I dunno when, prolly sometime in 2011. <br /><br />The fracture never healed, so in Feb of 2012 my doc put an implant in the the bone, for to increase stability blah blah blah. Damn bone won&#039;t heal, and now another fracture, same bone. Sooo, my lovelies, what the fuck do I do?<br /><br />Yes, I realize that is a rather broad query, so I will narrow it down a bit. What can I do, to stimulate my immune system and accelerate the bone growth? I have used the bone growth stimulator, to no avail. Plus I hate the squishy icky goo that is the transfer medium for the transponder. <br /><br />This new surgery will remove the old implant.&nbsp; The surgeon will then put bone graft stuff in both fractures, and a new solid titanium implant the length of the bone.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not new to this healing business, this will make roughly the 20th surgery I have had in my short 43 yrs on the planet. <br /><br />I have never had a fracture not heal. For example, when I got splatted on my &#039;cycle in 2000, I broke 5 ribs, a lovely skull fracture, broke my left thumb, left leg crushed from the knee down, 10%of my skin from my right side I left on that black top, my right arm almost ripped out of its socket, and two fractured vertebrae. So I know from traumatic injuries, how to heal. <br /><br />This foot thing utterly baffles me. I have quit tobacco,&nbsp; I do smoke pot, have been doing a bit more blow recently..(thankya SR wonderful vendors), I don&#039;t do meth anymore, and I rarely consume alcohol. I take a vitamin regimen every day, and eat a fairly decent diet. I am fat, that&#039;s a given at this point, not being able to go out, no dancing, no workouts. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no heart disease. Yes, I do have breathing difficulties from working in electronic manufacturing for waaay too many years. <br /><br />So any ideas? I am also looking at a full shoulder replacement, but that is another sordid tale for another dark and froggy knight.

				Feet injurys always take forever to heal as its pretty much impossible to not use it baring constant wheelchair use, I had a broken toe that took almost 2 yrs to heal where as arms fingers leg ribs etc etc all were healed to a usable condition in 6 weeks. I guess you could look at it like a kidney you have 2 but only need one soooo chop that sucker off and get a prostetic, failing that the only real way is to rest it.<br />Do you have a lot of calcium in your diet?&nbsp; Do you have any problems with your nails or hair?

				Thank you very much for your response, and understanding. <br /><br />I do take Caltrate Petites, as my calcium supplement in my vit. regimen. No problem with my &#039;do or the nails. <br /><br />Staying off the damn foot has been a real issue. I admit I have not followed the strict directives of my doc regarding staying off of it. Kinda impossible when riding that oh so fine line between abject miserable failure to succeed, and the American Dream. As in I do all the household maintenance, the vehicle maintenance, most of the cooking, and have three dogs and too many cats.<br /><br />If I were a rich man, and could afford to hire someone to take care of my responsibilities, that would be the best option. However, that is not in the cards I have dealt myself. (I take responsibility for my decisions that have led me to this place, this when)<br /><br />Anywho, thanks and I appreciate the journey you have been on as well. Makes me feel just a bit less fuckered up to know that this is not uncommon.
