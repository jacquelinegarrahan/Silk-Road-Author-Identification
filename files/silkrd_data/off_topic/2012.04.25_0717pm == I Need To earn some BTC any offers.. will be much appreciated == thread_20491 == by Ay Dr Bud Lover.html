				Another A hole with no help^ <br /><br />What is wrong with you lot <br />Set of miserable tw*ts <br /><br />You come on here.. Find a thread that you cant help with<br />you just point out mistakes of others .. Take a look at your <br />Own posts.&nbsp; Your own life .. And do something good with<br />It ... You trolls must get so bored learning from your own<br />Mistakes.. You come on to the computer hiding away while<br />You dish out nothing but negativity.. No wonder<br /><br />Listen: liven up. Lifes not about evryone else u f*kd up troll<br />Take a look at your own life .. Atleast im looking for work <br />Everywhere I can <br /><br />-...<br /><br />

				You&#039;re not gonna find any work on a anonymous drug forum..<br />&nbsp;<br />Seriously check craigslist or something if you&#039;re an IT professional, it makes no sense to ask a bunch of strangers who are here to buy and sell drugs if they have any work for you, then get pissed off when people tell you to get a job.<br /><br />.

				Make hemp jewelry and sell it on here. There are a lot of people that I imagine would enjoy buying a nice hemp necklace with blown glass beads in it and such.
