				Hello,<br />After browsing market boards for hours i notice one thing which is in high demand, UK driving licenses and Passports. However, most of these, if found, cost hundreds if not thousands of pounds to get a 1:1 copy. Another thing i have noticed is that most of the people looking to obtain these are not high level carding kings, but in fact people under the age of 18 looking for some form of identification as they can buy are restricted products (i.e. Alcohol and cigarettes). I have not seen any demand for PASS cards as of yet and i think these would be the best thing for them. However, the pass hologram is extremely difficult to replicate meaning if it was replicated it would still be at a very high price. So I&#039;ve done a little bit of research about these cards and i have found out that it is possible to obtain one without any official id and you can get hold of one by simply using a referee to confirm you age/details. <br /><br />So this is where i need your help, The referee must be within the EU but preferably in the UK and they must be one of the following<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your doctor/dentist/nurse/administrator – checking NHS records<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher/tutor/administrator at your school/college/university<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your social worker/ Your certified solicitor or accountant<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bank / building society staff member at Your branch<br /><br />So, how hard would it be to fake a referee on one of these forms and go unnoticed and what sort of checks do they do on the referee?<br />The card i am looking at is the &#039;Citizencard&#039;<br />Thanks in advance<br />

				I would assume it would be hard to fake a referee...knowing the UK government they would carry out extensive checks...
