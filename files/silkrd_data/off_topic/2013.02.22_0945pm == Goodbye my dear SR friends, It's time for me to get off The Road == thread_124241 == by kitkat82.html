				Well, I just want to say thank you so much to everyone who has just shown this outpouring of support, kindness, and love in the past two weeks or so as I struggled with my emotional/mental crisis.&nbsp; I am doing somewhat better now, and am able to see that as much as i enjoy this community and the fun conversations we have, it just isn&#039;t possible for me to get better while on here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have appointments to see a therapist and a psychiatrist, and I am not suicidal anymore, so that&#039;s a plus.&nbsp; I just have to get out of the house, and having irl friends would be a big step towards me actually getting better.&nbsp; It&#039;s just too easy for me to hide out behind a computer screen.&nbsp; I am sure some of you can relate.<br /><br />I am going to miss so many of you, that I am not going to even attempt to list names, because so many of you have touched me that I couldn&#039;t possibly begin to make a complete list without accidentally leaving off a name and hurting someones feelings.<br /><br />Love you guys, and I&#039;m gonna miss you.&nbsp; Since I am a melodramatic sensitive person, here is a goodbye song for you all...from me.&nbsp; (Well obviously I didn&#039;t write it, but you get the idea&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a00_tPLcE_g<br /><br />She would never say where she came from<br />Yesterday don&#039;t matter if it&#039;s gone<br />While the sun is bright<br />Or in the darkest night<br />No one knows<br />She comes and goes<br /><br />Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday<br />Who could hang a name on you?<br />When you change with every new day<br />Still I&#039;m gonna miss you...<br /><br />Don&#039;t question why she needs to be so free<br />She&#039;ll tell you it&#039;s the only way to be<br />She just can&#039;t be chained<br />To a life where nothing&#039;s gained<br />And nothing&#039;s lost<br />At such a cost<br /><br />Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday<br />Who could hang a name on you?<br />When you change with every new day<br />Still I&#039;m gonna miss you...<br /><br />There&#039;s no time to lose, I heard her say<br />Catch your dreams before they slip away<br />Dying all the time<br />Lose your dreams<br />And you will lose your mind.<br />Ain&#039;t life unkind?<br /><br />Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday<br />Who could hang a name on you?<br />When you change with every new day<br />Still I&#039;m gonna miss you...<br /><br />Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday<br />Who could hang a name on you?<br />When you change with every new day<br />Still I&#039;m gonna miss you...

				I definitely think that&#039;s the right decision for you right now -- maybe one day you&#039;ll be in a good place and feel like you can come back without it making things worse.&nbsp; Wish you all the best, of course!

				I read your posts.<br /><br />I was genuinely worried about you.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure a few others too. <br />Glad you got the right help.&nbsp; It makes a world of difference.<br /><br />There is compassion and caring in every community.

				First thought: Noooo!!<br />But then again, yeah, you&#039;re making the right decision.<br />I have this theory that in secret, all women hate each other...which is funny, because the first time that we interacted here, you&#039;d said something that pissed me off...didn&#039;t even know you were a chick at that point. Regardless...<br />I wish you the best of luck and love in your life, kitkat.<br />We are always here for you. When or if you ever decide to come back.<br />*waves so long for now*

				Ok, I logged on to read the last few messages I have and delete my account...but I can&#039;t pretend not to be upset and hurt by a lot of the negative comments saying I am making shit up or attention seeking.&nbsp; So to the people who seem to be total assholes about this....Why don&#039;t you listen up to what the deal is.<br /><br /><br />I have a personality disorder, been confirmed and reconfirmed for 11 years by many psychologists and psychiatrists called Borderline Personality Disorder....it makes it near impossible when I am untreated for me to control my impulses, and I do 100% mean what I say when I say it, but don&#039;t realize that it is attention seeking or that I am trying to push people away or whatever.&nbsp; So when I say I took an overdose, then I actually did.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really have a whole lot of control when I get in that frantic state of mind, and I do make posts or phone calls to people that are attention seeking, but not intentionally, if that makes sense?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an active control or awareness of these behaviors. It&#039;s not like &quot;Oh I am lonely, let me act like a whiny bitch&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br /><br /><br />If I have a friend who says they are going to call me at 8 or if my sister says she is going to meet me for lunch and cancels, I get deeply hurt, I have an inability to see a grey area, and I internalize and make everything personal.&nbsp; So whatever....you may call it attention seeking and sneer at me....but it is pretty much my illness...and it&#039;s actually called para suicidal behavior, which often ends in many cases with completed suicide.&nbsp; So fuck off if you can&#039;t be a little kind to someone who has never felt a moment of personal peace in 30 years.<br /><br />http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION=symptoms<br /><br />Impulsive and risky behavior, such as risky driving, unsafe sex, gambling sprees or illegal drug use<br />Awareness of destructive behavior, including self-injury, but sometimes feeling unable to change it<br />Wide mood swings<br />Short but intense episodes of anxiety or depression<br />Inappropriate anger and antagonistic behavior, sometimes escalating into physical fights<br />Difficulty controlling emotions or impulses<br />Suicidal behavior<br />Feeling misunderstood, neglected, alone, empty or hopeless<br />Fear of being alone<br />Feelings of self-hate and self-loathing<br />When you have borderline personality disorder, you often have an insecure sense of who you are. Your self-image, self-identity or sense of self often rapidly changes. You may view yourself as evil or bad, and sometimes you may feel as if you don&#039;t exist at all. An unstable self-image often leads to frequent changes in jobs, friendships, goals and values.<br /><br />Your relationships are usually in turmoil. You may idealize someone one moment and then abruptly and dramatically shift to fury and hate over perceived slights or even minor misunderstandings. This is because people with borderline personality disorder often have difficulty accepting gray areas — things seem to be either black or white.

Well, it&#039;s sort of relevant to me. She used to threaten suicide all the time too, and you can never be sure how serious they are about that.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a high correlation between drug abuse and mental illness, ie people with existing psychiatric problems self-medicate with illicit drugs, so it shouldn&#039;t be surprising if such people are overrepresented in this community.<br /><br />Anyway, best of luck kitkat, and I hope you find the help and peace of mind that you need.<br />
