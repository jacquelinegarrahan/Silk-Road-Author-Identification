				Done:<br /><br />MJ<br />Alcohol<br />Tobacco<br />MDMA<br />DMT<br />Shrooms<br /><br />I&#039;d be down to try practically anything if I knew it was pure really. I&#039;m very curious to try LSD but it&#039;s a real bitch to find even on here. Would also like to try Ketamine&nbsp; and plan to in the coming months. Some opiates may be interesting too but I&#039;m not nearly curious enough to pay for them.<br /><br />I know people IRL who like to take xanax but for everything I&#039;ve read on SR it seems to be used more as a means of aborting the effects of other drugs and I can&#039;t imagine what recreational value they have by themselves.

Top of my list, however, would be Ayahuasca, with LSD on that list. I&#039;ve also been thinking about trying adderal to help me study.Adderall is great. I&#039;m ready to try Vyvanse and Dexedrine<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Fuck Vyvanse!&nbsp; IMHO, Adderall and Methylphenidate are vastly superior stimulants.&nbsp; The latter two both last longer for me, and the comedowns are not as unpleasant.&nbsp; For me, Lisdexamfetamine hits really hard and it feels greatly euphoric, but then within three hours, the effects are diminishing, and I&#039;m left in dysphoria.&nbsp; With Adderall and Ritalin, the only &quot;comedown&quot; I got was insomnia which resulted in me not being able to sleep till 9 a.m. sometimes, but I was relaxed and not irritable like on the Vyvanse comedown.&nbsp; Some people seem to like it, though.
