				I wanna like to know what pisses you off when you are buying/waiting on things OR when you sold something and are waiting to have your coins. This are just some basic things i wrote down as an example, but their are a lot off things that can make you pissed and if you have time and write as much as you can down then be my geust&nbsp; :P.<br /><br />What me pisses me off is that when i have to wait on my coins knowing that the person just wrote a pm that he got the order and that he/she says thx and all that stuff...But then the day after they FE and are like &quot;yeah sorry man my pc just broke down OR damn the power went off just when i was writing your feedback and wanted to FE!&quot;. Lucky that it was the same member/costumer and he is on my black list. As a little vendor i don&#039;t have much to tell but others are welcome to tell just some worst cases that they have been trough or so&nbsp; :).<br /><br />As a buyer i like honesty...and the thing that ALWAYS makes me mad is that they set your order &quot;in transit&quot;....And they ship only the next day or 2 days after and then everybody is like : &quot;Wooow lightening fast service...10/5 for that!!&quot; Yeah then it is easy to be known as a fast sender. I change a status &quot;in transit&quot; ONLY WHEN I HAVE PUT IT IN THE P.O BOX AND I AM BACK ONLINE WHEN I AM BACK HOME!<br /><br />And the thing that not pisses me off but i have to say this to is when i read feedback from clients like &quot;Other vendors should take a note from this vendor&quot;...&quot;This is what i call a seller....he answers my messages in minutes and whenever it is day or night i have my answer back really quick :)!!!!&quot;...Well i like to say to those people....Some sellers like myself have a life and a job besides Silk Road and i/we all do our best to answer and ship as quick as possible, but if you don&#039;t have a job or a life and you can live behind your computer OR you have a team...then yeah then you can be that vendor were all other vendors should learn from.<br /><br />Djeezzz, i say...Give more respect to the sellers that have a real job AND STILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE PRODUCTS&nbsp; AND ANSWER YOUR MESSAGES AND KEEP YOU UP TO DATE. <br />I just think that the most biggest vendors here on SR that earn very very good money were already street dealers or higher guys in the drug business and they just find their way to SR here and know if they are careful with the packaging they can make BIG BUCKS because they are safer and they can ask for some products 3 times as much off the price when they used to sell irl on clients.<br />.......<br /><br />This was my text to start off, but if you have +10 things to say that really pisses you off no mater that your are a seller or a buyer just put it here. In the end it is all for the better and maybe some can read some posts and change the way off doing or saying....Please try to post only the real things that pisses you off and you need to say it for maybe to see a change...you know what i mean.<br /><br />Have a nice day all!!!!!<br />Greeetttttzzzz

				The biggest thing that bothers me is when a seller won&#039;t reply. Not as you said you have a life and everything, But when you see they have read your message and just ignored it. <br /><br />The other thing is when you ask the seller about their product and they give a good description. So you order it and it&#039;s not what they said. <br /><br />That&#039;s really all I have as of now but I am a new member so :P

				Receiving stupid questions/requests from clients.<br />People thinking that just because you have the blue-stripe means you have any influence over the goings on of SR/can help them with their order/are here to hold hands<br />People not using GPG right so I can&#039;t decrypt what they are saying<br />People asking me stupid shit like &quot;Oh yeah, I&#039;m a BTC short can you knock the price down&quot;<br />People asking me things which they can quite easily find out on the forum.<br />People asking me cheeky shit like &quot;As I am buying xyz from you maybe I can sample abc and def too?

				I see that the thread has already more reply&#039;s then i expected (i thought 4to 5 would be good to read already&nbsp; :)). But it is good that we can see what bothers the vendor/buyer and without going into conflict. Example from Limetless&nbsp; : Some members can think about asking a certain question before asking it at the vendor. <br /><br />You see, here you can wright down what bothers you or what really push your buttons without calling out names. Also you can say a certain unpleasant experience with a buyer/vendor and you don&#039;t even have to say the name of that buyer/member, because if he/she reads this that person can change the service/attitude for the better without giving an angry reply. If that person knows that the story/experience was between him and the poster then the best thing on this thread is to keep the peace and just change certain ways off doing business or as a buyer you then know that it is better to Finalize once you have your product instead off waiting 24 hours or days to release the funds because you then will have a better seller/buyer relationship if you know that you just change 1 thing and you all get along better.<br /><br />So my English is not so good and trying to explain what the meaning off this thread here is...I hope most off you get the point what the meaning is off this thread off me....Just keeping the peace and make SR a better place where there is also room to reply or read this topic/thread and have less fights between members over sometimes the littlest stupidest thing&nbsp; ;)<br />I just wanna make more members and more topics/threads to be positive, until SR is known to the best and happiest marketplace around on the TOR Network&nbsp; ;) :D .<br /><br />If this sound ridiculous or so to some members then please say so, i&#039;m also only trying&nbsp; ;).<br /><br />Have a nice day all!!<br />Greeetttzzz

				I hear having a a PGP name different to your Silkroad username is an annoyance for vendors as it causes confusion, I changed mine as soon as I heard this. <br /><br />As a buyer, very slow processing times annoy me and vendors ignoring messages when there is a problem. Also I am pissed off that my fairly new buyer account now has a 80% refund rate because of one shitty vendor who refused to communicate with me on a package that didn&#039;t show.<br /><br />Otherwise I love this place, escrow is great, the forums are really helpful and most of the people who hang out here are good fun.

				Stress-relief thread. Yes.<br />As a buyer I do not like how I did not receive my tracking number for my important package upon requesting it and paying for tracking. I suspect I did not even get one.<br />If I were a seller, I would age much quicker I am sure, as the stress would be ridiculous.<br />On another buyer note, I have been tearing my hair out waiting for a package (again, no tracking number) and I have lost sleep over this. This is entirely my fault for not relaxing 100%, but how can I? I have to keep an eye out for the fucking police. And if I do not have a tracking number how will I have any inkling a package might have been caught in customs?

				When you finally see a product you&#039;ve been wanting for sale by a vendor with good feedback, only to scroll down and see that 100% of their feedback is people who finalized early.<br /><br />People who write &quot;Finalizing early for trusted vendor&quot; when the vendor has only been around for 10 fucking days.<br /><br />People who write &quot;Finalizing early for trusted vendor&quot; when the vendor has only been around for 10 fucking days, and all of their other feedback is from people who finalized early. <br /><br />How in the hell are they trusted?

				Vendors who are openly suspicious of you as a customer if you report that your order didn&#039;t come through. <br /><br />I had this recently with a respected vendor who more or less accused me of scamming him despite the fact that I have been a long-term user of SR and have only ever had one refund from 30+ transactions.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I hate the 5/5 buyer feedback who says &quot;AMAZINGLY fast shipping. Very good experience with seller. I haven&#039;t gotten around to try it yet, but when I do I&#039;ll post a review.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s great that the seller is nice, it&#039;s great that it arrived quickly. But the most important thing is how is the product! So what&#039;s the point of leaving a 5/5 feedback if you haven&#039;t even tried the stuff yet. Furthermore, what the hell are you waiting for?! If&nbsp; you get something in the mail, that means you are home. And if you are home, why aren&#039;t you tearing open your package like a 9 year old on Christmas day and playing with your new toy? The time spent writing your incomplete premature feedback rating could be time spent trying out the product! OMG I don&#039;t get that.
