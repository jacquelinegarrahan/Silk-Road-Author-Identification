				its very common to rent someone for 5 years to get them into the country with an passport and such. In return they clean house, cook dinner and in some (or i think the most) they spread the legs.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for an asian type since my complete house is asian decorated + they are more trustable then mexicans. No sex required, i&#039;m happy married and both couldnt be botherd to clean the house or cook meals anymore. So we decided to look to rent someone and offer them a better future.

				Go to chinasmack.com and post an ad.&nbsp; It is a dating site, but I&#039;m sure you can find women there looking for a better life in whatever country you live in.&nbsp; Plus, if they are allowed to date who they want, I think they would be really happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just don&#039;t let them drive.&nbsp; I hear Asian women suck at driving
