				Hi Everybody,<br /><br />I went out for Halloween with gf and another gf and I start bragging about SR.&nbsp; They are very interested in ephedrine cuz they both want to lose weight.&nbsp; (kind of pisses me off because they are both one size under me :) )&nbsp; .... So anyway after I tell them about it they tell me ephedrine is same as sudaphed and easily converts to meth if you know what you are doing.<br /><br />We do NOT want to convert to meth.&nbsp; We want to convert it amphetamine.&nbsp; Googling around we find alot of stuff that basically says yes, you can convert ephedrine to amphetamine and it is pretty simple to make a small amount.&nbsp; So what is the problem you say?&nbsp; There are NO directions anywhere in the entire WWW that we can find.<br /><br />If anyone has directions or at least a link please share.<br /><br />Peace &amp; Love,<br /><br />TD

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think your best bet is just to buy amphetamines like Adderall and Ritalin on the Silk. If you are feeling bolder buy paste.&nbsp; If you start cooking shit and don&#039;t know the ropes you can butt bang things up pretty easy.&nbsp; lol not that I speak from experience its just that I have not known too many people who get it right and there are some dudes on SR that GET IT RIGHT. 8)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have bought Amphetamine paste on here three times and at first I thought it was a really fucked up product but then I figured out the best way to use it for me.&nbsp; Buy two grams.&nbsp; Let it dry.&nbsp; split it into 8 or 4 piles depending on how strong you want your capsules.&nbsp; Put it in the capsules.&nbsp; Drop on a totally empty and you will be cranked up bigtime!&nbsp; Its basically like turning a switch you can go from exhausted to full steam ahead and stay in that gear for like 12 hours.&nbsp; Best part about it?&nbsp; You dont look all buggy coked up.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry to get off track but thats my two bits.&nbsp; If you ever find a way to make amphetamine or ampetamine paste from ephedrine let me know but I have a feeling its just NOT that easy.&nbsp; Some guy will come on here and say oh sheesh you just take some of this .... some of that..... and before you know it you just blew up the trailer. ha! lol sorry making myself laugh tonight.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Sadly I also can&#039;t offer advice on what you&#039;re trying to do...however i can second the opinion to buy either pills or paste from here...it will save you a lot of trouble.

				There is no easy method to convert ephedrine to amphetamine, period.&nbsp; If you are willing to take the time to learn organic chemistry and at least obtain some basic lab equipment then you have a chance.&nbsp; You will also need to invest some time and some $$$ into some safety equipment if you are going to do it the right way.&nbsp; &nbsp;Assuming you are willing to do all this, for amphetamine you are not going to start with ephedrine anyway.&nbsp; If you are going to start with an ephedra alkaloid, you start with phenylpropanolamine (PPA).&nbsp; If you are in the US, it&#039;s no longer available for humans, but is still used in veterinary medicine.<br /><br />If you are willing to take the time to learn how to do things right, more power to you.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not, then forget it, and take Halogen&#039;s advice and get yourself some Adderall or dexedrine.<br /><br />--Kilo

				Or maybe even better yet, why don&#039;t you give Aakoven&#039;s or Jeurgen2001&#039;s Dutch pep a shot?&nbsp; It&#039;s likely cheaper and safer from several vantage points ;)

				its much easier to convert ephedrine into methcathinone, in fact i think its arguably the easiest drug to synth, so if you want to start drug chemistry i suggest starting there, but do your reading first, LOTS OF READING if you dont fancy spending a decent amount of time getting your chemistry basics down and understanding the synth youre doing then just stay away and buy what you need instead.

				every body thus far has given shitty advice, i know for a fact that its dead simple to convert ephedrin pills into amphetamine<br /><br />Id like info on how to convert it also, also how to make it int crystal meth<br /><br />The instructions used to be all over the internet a few years ago, i guess the internet police have put a stop to it<br /><br />you dont need chemistry education to do it, I hung out with some dummy a few years ago who got the ingredients in a hardwaare store(along with the ephedrine he had) and he made amphetamine<br /><br />the guy was not what you would call, umm, inteligent<br /><br />

				all the things Ive seen on Rodium that mention ephedrin are all for the person with a scientific back ground, not Gomer out in the trailor with a bottle full of ephedrine<br /><br />Ive got to go ask Gomer, he knows how to do it<br /><br />Someone should sell a 2 dollar ebook on Silk Road about how to do this, with pictures and hardware store ingredients needed

				Biscuit,<br /><br />Ya I know where you are coming from about hearing it was an easy process.&nbsp; I remember a local news broadcast several years ago talking about kids making it out in a trailer and then progressing to a super easy method where all they used was like an empty two litre pop bottle, some ephedrine and some basic household cleaners you could find just about anywhere and presto they where making meth.&nbsp; Bizarre.<br /><br />td

				assuming you haven&#039;t taken even one semester of organic chemistry it&#039;s really not recommended. but if you must...<br /><br />acquire these items first:<br /><br />charcoal mask with integrated eye protection (looks like a gas mask)<br />45 mil chemical/acid apron<br />neoprene/natural rubber blend gloves<br /><br />after that, someone might be more inclined to discuss.

				Is crank just a trashy sounding name for amphetamine<br /><br />I allways heard that crank was dirty crystal meth<br /><br />on a side not I just read that&nbsp; World Pro Surf Champion Andy Irons died from too much crystal meth(his heart blew up)<br />that dude was #1 in the world for a few years, craziness<br /><br />RIP Andy Irons

				it&#039;s usually dirty methamphetamine. the process of crystallization is a way to remove impurities from chemicals, etc. you can even crystallize aspirin among other things. so from a technical standpoint crystal meth is not &quot;dirty&quot; although it can still have a lot of impurities. for instance they found some that was orange in color because it contained a huge amount of boron.<br /><br />cranks different colors is the result of the process used. you can have green, brown, red, yellow and so on.<br /><br />the blue crystals are from a different process altogether and purple is usually ok too, typically iodine from a phosphorus iodine process.

				Biscuit - doesnt it make you wonder how many people really use meth?&nbsp; I mean there it is in the news &quot;Andy Irons dies from Meth...&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;C&#039;mon how many athletes are using this stuff?&nbsp; In one form or another people use amphetamines big time.&nbsp; I dated a guy who was a defensive end for ____ ________.&nbsp; They were a great team in his era and he swears there was not a guy on their D that was not cranked up on something.&nbsp; Truth is if you are a competitive athlete, you are at a disadvantage in many sports if you arnt cranked. lol.&nbsp; fucking sad but true.&nbsp; I mean I love to take speed cuz its fun not cuz it earns me a huge fuckin&#039; paychck.
