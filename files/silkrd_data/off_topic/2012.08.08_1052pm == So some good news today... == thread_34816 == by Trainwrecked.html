				feelyabro.jpg<br /><br />I&#039;m in a very similar situation. I&#039;ve been jerked around my whole life and over the past 5 months have been ripped off a few times for a grand total of $780 (I babysit and people seem to think it&#039;s okay to not pay your sitter now?!).<br /><br />I recently started working for a new website from home and the fifth was to be my first paycheck. I felt confident because the people who hired me were very thorough in hiring me and I trusted them. <br /><br />Aug 2: email from boss confirming hours and check amount, asking for best way to send.<br /><br />No answer to multiple emails for 5 days. I was sure I&#039;d been fucked over. Again.<br /><br />Today I get an email from my boss apologising profusely for the lack of communication and explaining what had happened. Got paid.<br /><br />I generally have a &quot;people suck&quot; attitude, but this restored my faith in humanity a little, along with the people from SR I&#039;ve done business with being legit too.<br /><br />I&#039;m high. Sorry.<br /><br />***edit: My last sentence wasn&#039;t a jab at OP. LOL I ramble when I&#039;m high.**

				Does anybody around here have any interesting thoughts to share on what has been happening with the Bitcoin exchange rates? The first batch I ever bought cost me $4.50 each. Now I&#039;m looking at $11. Looking back, I wish I had the money and the brains to invest in it... I read some history and it seems BTC have been this high and even higher, but then there was a crash and now it&#039;s climbing back up, steadily. Anybody know what was the highest point BTC ever reached? And why it crashed? :o

				It&#039;s quite clear what is happening to the BTC exchange rates lol. You just need to think logically, the BTC is no different to any other currency.

				Did you get knocked over by Tony Delta? That seems like fuckin years ago now, I just started then and I hadn&#039;t even properly heard of him before the shit proper kicked off with that. I&#039;d have probs got shagged as well if I had because he had good Coke didn&#039;t he?
