				For those who don&#039;t know, the whole Friday the 13th thing comes from when the King of France had the Freemasons and their Grandmaster burnt at the stake for being homos and pedophiles.<br /><br />Celebrate today as the day that the child-fucker DeMolay and his slimey fuck brothers were burnt to a crisp.

If you read your history, you&#039;d know that Philip did indeed charge them with pedophilia and other sexual depravity (gay shit), and from what I know about freemasons, I&#039;m sure the charges were accurate.
