Ate at a place called Nirvana in Kensington quite a lot, I also got hooked on sweet potato fries, nowhere in the UK sells them.&nbsp; :-\ I think America is the ultimate destination for food tho, really wanna visit sometime soon. Watching Man V Food only torments me further.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to know how Americans visiting the UK view our food and customer service. IMO its mostly shite unless you know where to go.

A muffin is a sweet doughy textured entity that you have as a treat or inject directly into your veins if you are a fat girl in Texas. A Crumpet however is a soft spongy thing that you have hot with butter on and/or some sort of spread (sweet or savoury) so it&#039;s a very versatile thing. It&#039;s also probably 30% responsible for building the British Empire along with Afternoon Tea and our Class-System and the Stiff-Upper-Lip. :)
