				Hello,<br />I was unable to find any french weed seller on the SR market, can sb please tells me if there is actually a person who does it?<br />If not, is it good idea to open a vendor account and become one?<br />I know lot of sellers are shipping worldwide, but I still want to help the system.<br />Thanks in advance.

				Thx a lot Stexo for answering my questions. But actually I don&#039;t want to buy weed, I would like to sell it through SR I got really good home made genetics. France is unfortunately too much self satisfied, and french people are close minded. That&#039;s why I wanted to help.<br />By the way, if sb has good information about shipping weed from France, just give me some links :)<br />I know i may find it on the &quot;shipping&quot; topic, but there is almost 300 pages on the subject, and my TOR browser is hell too slow..<br />Thx in advance, and sorry for my &quot;frenchnaturallynewbieness&quot;.

But they are, in fact, pussies. (as history shows)<br /><br />I really do fancy a trip in your time machine Lim if you were with my mother last night. I have so many things I would like to say to her (first of which would be to warn against sexual relations with her....because I don&#039;t want future you to be my father by some strange butterfly effect coincidence.)<br /><br />I thought mothers were off limits (even though your nym is limetless, I thought you would draw the line somewhere) I have not had much nice to say about you, but there are some lines that I try not to cross.

				No, I understand that&#039;s what you were saying. I called the french pussies, and that makes me a child molester. <br /><br />then I will call you &quot;bad news&quot; and you will come up with something else clever to call me.<br /><br />and the epic struggle between wretched and limetless will go on causing no real damage to either of us until the end of times.<br /><br />lovely to have this exchange with you, but I&#039;m sure you have plenty of other BS to post on about, and I have better things to do today than keep on talking with a bot....so off we go..

Why do you care about what I think of you? I have not made it a secret....granted I haven&#039;t been too specific about why. I just usually use the term &quot;bad news&quot; because that is what you are (to me)

				I don&#039;t care that I&#039;m on your ignore list kiddo, nor that you asked why my stripes had been removed which I quite happily explained. I&#039;m just enjoying having a pop at you because I find you to be generally cuntish so I&#039;m just returning the bitchy comments you made before and which you clearly did wait until I&#039;d gone off for a bit to make (which yes, does make you a huge pussy). I didn&#039;t realize the comments were a one way street Wretched? Or is it just that you are too much of a sensitive soul to take what you dish out?
