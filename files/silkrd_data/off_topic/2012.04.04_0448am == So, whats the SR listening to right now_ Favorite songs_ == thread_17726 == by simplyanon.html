				I usually listen to music when I&#039;m online, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one. So, whatcha listening to? What&#039;s your favorite song? <br /><br />Idk, I love somkin some good bud, and blasting some music. <br /><br />Listening to: American Death by Senses Fail<br /><br />Favorite song would have to be: The Trooper by Maiden.

				If I&#039;m on psychedelics then I&#039;d rather be listening to some type of groove (instruments or electric) usually without lyrics or with deep profound lyrics (bassnectar, sound tribe sector 9, mim0sa, Papadosio, Santana, Pink Floyd, etc)<br /><br />but when im on other drugs like uppers etc.. most music is good except country and a few others.

				Someone mentioned Animal by Miike Snow, the Mark Ronson Extended Mix is better than the original imo<br /><br />The Coasters- Down in Mexico (POSSO Bootleg), another badass remix<br /><br />M.I.A.- Bad Girls, awesome song and the video is a must see<br /><br />The Killers- Exitlude<br /><br />Santigold- Disparate Youth<br /><br />Dom- Jesus (VACATIONER Remix)<br /><br />Breton- The Well<br /><br />Andrew Bird&#039;s new album Break it Yourself <br /><br />and lots more but i&#039;ll stop there haha
