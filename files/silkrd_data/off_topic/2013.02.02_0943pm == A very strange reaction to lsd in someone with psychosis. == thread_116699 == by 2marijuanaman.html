				I was talking to my friend, and she had a very strange reaction to lsd. She has a pre-existing psychosis that occurs in episodes. (i.e. Thinking that she will die because a phone alarm went off that she didn&#039;t remember setting) She&#039;s always been very strange regardless though. Sometimes during these episodes she says she could potentially be dangerous to others. (It was NOT my idea to give her lsd, she took it herself and I had nothing to do with it.) I have a feeling that she has a very unique brain chemistry. She seems highly intelligent to me. lsd does&#039;nt seem to affect her much, and here&#039;s what she told me.<br /><br />lsd gives her &quot;clearer vision and makes her feel more highly functional&quot;, and she compares it to adderoll. She tried lsd from four different sources (that have worked for others) and this result is consistent. It&#039;s definitely not the acid, it&#039;s her. She said she does not get visuals. She understands the concept of how lsd affects others based on material that she&#039;s read.<br /><br />There are other interesting things about her brain chemistry too. She says that she &#039;HATES WEED&quot; and that marijuana makes her feel &quot;flaccid as a human being&quot;. She also mentioned that she feels it&#039;s just unhealthy to use it in her condition. She doesn&#039;t like how opiates feel either. She says that she does like speed pills like adderoll though.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t even know what to make of that... But I find it fascinating. I promise that I know these things to be true, and I would like to know if anyone can possibly shed some light on her condition. Google searches brought up posts by people that didn&#039;t seem to know what there talking about at all.

				she has panic attacks? <br />i think the uppers and the cid could make it worse.&nbsp; the upps can cause psychosis and paranoia long term and the cid could intensify it if one happens during a trip. <br />Shes taking medication? Benzos maybe? those could interfere with the other substances...

				She might just have a higher tolerance, still is not recommended to proceed if she has mental illness background or is under psychiatric treatment, if so, that is probably the cause of her high tolerance, also, as said before, the LSD she is getting may be weak.

				Like I said, I&#039;m positive the acid was not weak. I wouldn&#039;t be wasting my time posting this if I wasn&#039;t completely sure and really wanted to understand her condition! It fascinates me, and she doesn&#039;t understand the cause either. Is it possible to have some kind of resistance or natural tolerance to lsd? She&#039;s taken plenty for a normal person, but says there are absolutely no visuals. This definitely has something to do with her brain chemistry, there&#039;s really no alternative explanation.4 years ago she could be described as strange and very open-minded. She didn&#039;t have any psychosis that I know of, but I wouldn&#039;t rule out the possibility that it was developing at the time. I didn&#039;t talk to her for a couple years and she was like this. I&#039;m not trying to give out personal info, but perhaps it should be noted that she is dating a sociopath (if that can shed any light on her condition, I&#039;m unsure) People saying that the acid is weak is not helpful because I&#039;ve ruled that out. I&#039;d like genuine help figuring this out, because there&#039;s a chance she&#039;s dangerous to society (And I just find it really fascinating) I hope I&#039;ve proven that I take this post very seriously. Let me know if you need any more info that isn&#039;t personal enough to endanger anonymity.

				Yes, like all drugs, different people have different reactions and tolerance to drugs. Not even colors are the same for all people eyes and minds. What is the highest dose she has taken, I assume she has at least taken 500ug for you and her to be stating is has no effect on her. Is she currently under other medication or illicit drug?

				Im not sure I find it strange at all. She&#039;s in a very highly-advanced ego trip, in which her adderall-like thoughts command all she surveys, and the lsd buoys up her illusion of insight and power. You cannoy &quot;get off&quot; into the egoless state of the &quot;trip&quot; after your mind is so possessed. She could take 1000 ug and she wouldnt go into the world of visions. She has been spoken to in that outer world. She has been given direction, and she has become lost in her thoughts; fueled by adderall, which - am i wrong? - has the same basic chemical structure as cocaine, but comes on longer and slower. <br />Im not quite sure what the problem is, except one red flag emerges: You constantly regard &#039;brain chemistry&#039; in your statements. Please dont fall heir to the illusion&nbsp; that mental &quot;dis&quot; ease has anything to do with brain fluids. Thats all bigPharma taking us for a ride. It&#039;s all emotional. It&#039;s all psychological. If I think you can read my thoughts you bet my brain chemistry, blood sugars and all that crap will go ape-shit. But its all because of the psychological input that is emotionally based. To treat this with chemicals like adderall is merely to keep ur friend drugged. Big Pharma CEO said it best: &quot;There are 2 things you dont want to do. You dont want to kill the patient, and you dont want to cure the patient.&quot;<br />However, having said that - and having spent a year in a mental hospital 40 years ago with schizophrenic episodes - I understand the H-E-L-L that ur friend will have to go thru to get off this; so welcome to the special world... <br />

				She&#039;s not on any daily medications and doesn&#039;t take anything everyday to my knowledge. I&#039;ll inquire about that to be sure. Carljung_forum I think you may be on to something... if your on an ego trip perhaps your mind cannot comprehend an ego-less trip. And that was SO helpful when you explained that it&#039;s not about brain chemistry, it&#039;s about thought patterns! But that also birngs up an interesting question, is this psychosis purely subjective and within her own control? For instance I have add, and feel like that condition is partially objective even though I have control over my own thoughts. People do have unique chemical makeup but just how much is within their own control I wonder? +1 to you carljung_forum<br /><br />I&#039;m not positive that this is about her ego-trip and wouldn&#039;t rule out other ideas. But that was very interesting to me and I&#039;ll tell her about that. Thanks for an input and more is definitely welcome and even asked for. It&#039;s good to have multiple viewpoints.

Brain chemicals exist, and it does matter when something goes terribly wrong with them.<br /><br />If I could make my condition go away with prayer or the atheist equivalent, you can bet your bottom dollar that I&#039;d have done it when they put me on meds when I was 10.<br /><br />I loath these meds, but being off of them is not an option. They cost so much that buying drugs on SR is cheaper! How&#039;s that for fair?<br /><br />I see this argument that if only I prayed hard enough, or other purely thought-related mechanisms, that I could easily cure myself, or free myself from this condition.<br /><br />I have heard the contention that my condition is illusory. I can tell you now with 100% confidence that it is not.<br /><br />Mental disorders are almost always physical in nature. You don&#039;t have to cut someone with a knife or shoot them with a gun to hurt them.<br /><br />Traumatic experiences can do physical damage to the brain, and I have a very very, VERY long family history of what used to be called &quot;manic depression.&quot;<br /><br />Do not be fooled. Psychosis, bipolar disorder, and other mental conditions are very real, and they require medical attention.

				^ Very helpful post as well. That&#039;s interesting and brain chemistry definitely does play a part. It doesn&#039;t seem seem fair that these conditions exist... I find this thread so fascinating and hope to get more info, thank you
