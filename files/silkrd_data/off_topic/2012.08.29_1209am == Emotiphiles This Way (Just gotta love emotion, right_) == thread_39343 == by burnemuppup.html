				Is there anyone else here who sees in their heart what I see in mine - a craving for powerful emotion, bordering on problematic?<br /><br />I was thinking a few minutes ago, and my train of thought passed through the idea that I&#039;m a dramatic, passionate, charmingly over-the-top individual, which I&#039;m happy to be whenever I&#039;m comfortable enough, after so many years of being withdrawn. I just like to give every moment that extra touch of vibrancy. I expanded from there to other thoughts I&#039;ve been having lately, that I crave intimacy of any and every kind, including an entire spectrum of platonic intimacy that society by and large finds &quot;too intimate for comfort [outside of romance],&quot; and that I crave excitement, and adventure, with the spirit of an explorer. These connect in a broad sense to find a simpler truth about me.<br /><br />I love intense, or powerful, or deep emotion. Emotion that&#039;s large in one direction or another.<br /><br />I&#039;ve discovered, interestingly, that this trait I so adore about myself is a gift and a curse - I find a certain degree of apathy in depression to be wrenchingly powerful, which makes it difficult for every part of me to want to escape, as there is a part of me that relishes the strength of the feeling, the completely overwhelming nature of it.<br /><br />Could this maybe be an intrinsic property of every fundamental truth, that every deviation from zero must be reflected on both sides of the equation? I think so, it would fit the fractalline nature of reality I&#039;ve experienced so far.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, is there anyone else here who has a serious problem not being surprised into a shocked, pained smile by the intensity of tragedy? Anyone else who finds that the only time they find the depth of emotion they desire from all relationships is in a romantic one, and just wish they could convince their friends to share every experience as intimately as they do on acid?<br /><br />Anyone else wish they could just spend every day drenched in feelings? Heh, maybe it&#039;s just me being really weird, I&#039;d be okay with that.

				While reading this I thought, &quot;Damn, I should come back and read this while tripping.&quot; I&#039;ve changed my mind though, I should read this while rolling :)<br /><br />I&#039;m beyond writing a long and thoughtful response to this at the moment, but I will say that I definitely get where you&#039;re coming from. For me it can sometimes be the intensity of an emotion that I enjoy rather than the positive/negative quality. I&#039;ve been through some level of depression (which still comes up from time to time) and whilst it can be horrible, it&#039;s a part of me. If I make it me, own it, take responsibility for it it stops being such an issue. Yeah I&#039;m not feeling the best, but that&#039;s me. I would rather feel absolutely shit than feel nothing.<br /><br />So yeah, I get where you&#039;re coming from. Whether you&#039;re being weird or not though, well if you are there are more people out there doing the same :)

				Have you been rolling a lot lately too MetaFractals?&nbsp; :P<br /><br />You&#039;re not alone.. I find myself experiencing the curse quite a bit. Wanting to be more intimate often leaves me at a distance because I&#039;m not so keen on lubricating social situations. I tend to quickly tune into the deeper emotions in myself and other people while overlooking normalized communication, ya know, small talk and stuff. I&#039;m fascinated by what lurks beneath the surface, I guess that&#039;s why I like this place. In the end I&#039;m left with a small number of close relationships and a general feeling of disconnect from everything else. It&#039;s a dance with the devil to build long-term romantic relationships like this... It&#039;s worth noting that, in retrospect, many of my most intimate relationships (mostly talkin romantic) have not been some sort of star-fated meeting with someone whom I instantly bonded to. There&#039;s some sort of unexplainable potential I feel like I think most people look for these deeper relationships but are either too afraid to dive into them or to smart to hang their emotions on such a thin thread. <br /><br />Hmm... I shall continue to stroke my beard *hits the pipe*
