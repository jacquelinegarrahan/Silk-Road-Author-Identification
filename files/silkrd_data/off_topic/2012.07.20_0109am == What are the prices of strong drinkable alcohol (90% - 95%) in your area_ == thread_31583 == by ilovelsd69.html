				Hi everyone, what are the prices of strong drinkable alcohol (90% - 95%) in your area? I mean alcohol like Everclear or other brands like that. Where i live i think the prices are outrageous:<br /><br />Alcool Global 94% <br />Alcool, 1.14 L, 62,75 $ (CAN)<br /><br />Alcool Global 94% <br />Alcool, 1.75 L, 77,00 $ (CAN)<br /><br />Is it me or this is twice the normal price of that kind of alcohol?

				Everclear? Vodka that is basically rocket fuel.<br /><br />IF you want pure alcohol then a still is easy to set up. You can buy ready made stills, easy to set up and you can watch each drop of pure fire fall into the bottle or demi jar.<br /><br />I knew a guy who was good with stills. Got busted after it grew so big they hired a warehouse and even had a guy doing door deliveries 24/7. <br /><br />I did get the actual pure alcohol, this was added to water at a rate of your basic 40%. Bottles were labelled in some Russian writing. Everyone in the surrounding villages knew the situation and it lasted a few years till he was busted. Still worth it. <br /><br />Would be interested in a thread on brewing alcohol and distilling the pure stuff.<br /><br />VERY useful for cleaning coke and stuff but HAS to be 100% pure.<br /><br />Crazy shit to drink. A few shots of that and you are fandangoed.<br /><br />I almost died on the shit. Fell asleep in the snow and ice. Found by a passing sober driver picking up some folk from a party.<br /><br />Great night!<br /><br />Worse EVER hangover of ALL drugs.<br /><br />Fucked for days after.<br /><br />But would of course do it again!<br /><br />Just not as much and more to watch the boaster fall over and offer to fight everyone, including the world.<br /><br />Always one who has to show off but with 100% proof you can quieten those annoying idiots and send them to dreamy land.

				I don&#039;t wanna be a smart-ass but I&#039;d like to start this post with a warning. Don&#039;t ever drink homemade alcohol unless you or whoever made it know their shit and you&#039;re 100% sure it&#039;s pure ethanol (and water) and nothing else.<br />When making pure alcohol you start off by putting a special kind of yeast into a container with sugar solution. The yeast will also need vitamins and minerals and shit. For that reason you can buy bags of yeast with the nutrients mixed right in the yeast.<br />Then you let the container rest for a few hours/days at a good temperature and when the yeast has died, you get the alcohol out of the solution. This is where most people fuck up. They either lack both a proper still and the ability to make one, or they have a still but have no knowledge on distilling.<br />When distilling, you throw away the first few drops. That&#039;s because the yeast is not only making ethanol, but also methanol, ethyl acetate and other volatile esters. These are highly toxic and cause those horrible half-week hangovers mentioned by red. They can also cause blindness (the permanent kind) and death.<br />When I was on summer vacation in Australia my uncle, who lives there, showed me how he makes alcohol. A friend of his made him an awesome still out of an old metal beer keg. If I recall correctly, I have filmed the whole procedure with my old cell phone. I could go through all of my memory cards and share the video with you guys, if you&#039;re interested.

I hope that&#039;s what you were suggesting, as posting videos just seems like one of the most incriminating things you could do if someone were to recognize someone from a video.
