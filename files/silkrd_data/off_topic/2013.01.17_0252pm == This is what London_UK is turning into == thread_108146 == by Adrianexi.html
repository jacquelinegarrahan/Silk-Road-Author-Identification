				Coward? Have you ever been into a fight with asians? Well I have, and trust me the only time you will fight them is when they are in a crew of 5 or more, because they stick together like clumps of shit and target single people - THAT is cowardly. The only reason I said stab is because you won&#039;t win against a number of them with fists, secondly they can&#039;t fight without weapons either. Thirdly these animals are not worth getting tired for, if I had a chance to, then yes fist fight, I can fight for sure believe me, but this is East London and as you see in the video, they only go for those who are weaker than themselves. I have no respect for people like that, then why bother TRYING to have a fair fight? <br />BNP is considered &#039;racist&#039;, they will never get in power, the Brits themselves can change this, by doing what the muslims themselves are doing. Protesting, violence and racism, that&#039;s the only way, there is just no people to organize it... to many people are afraid, now we are being racially abused, but who gives a fuck, media won&#039;t say it, and media is the most powerful broadcasters, if they were on our side then things would change

				I was only joking mate, you&#039;re definitely 100% right in what you said. (notice my next line after calling you a coward)<br />I&#039;ve thought about in the past, out of anger at attacks on innocent people. but I have no knowledge of Hex-plow-sieves and wouldn&#039;t want to risk my freedom doing so.<br />But also, I&#039;m not ready to let go of my life. If I ever get blessed with a terminal illness, I might possibly re-think. but not likely. <br /><br />(others reading this thread: don&#039;t start calling me up on governments attacking muslim nations, that has nothing to do with people who have been allowed to live and seek refuge in our country and claim benefits, who then decide to set off those ungodly devices on public transport and others who fly planes into highly populated buildings)<br />IMO we should do as australia does and deport the families of the families of the families of anyone involved in terrorism. that would probably get rid of more than half of the fuckers and free up the lines in our post offices, job centres, dole offices etc.<br /><br />as I believe their religion is mostly benevolent to the human race AND planet. as well as their behavior towards UK citizens. <br />If I could dose them all with LSD somehow, I would.<br /><br />Notice in the video how there&#039;s a gang of them. You&#039;ll never see a muslim fighting a person 1 on 1, unless they are trying to defend themself.<br />That&#039;s why they want to change the UK law to be able to carry around knives and kill anyone who gets in their way, including women.<br />Have you seen these bastards throwing battery acid over their own relatives? cutting off their noses or hands, etc?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I have a few Muslim friends some of which arent asian, aswell as many many more asian Hindu friends. <br />The former were born into it, and don&#039;t really believe in none of the shit. they&#039;re just punished by their families if they don&#039;t abide by the rules. (but a few of them love bacon, sausages, hotdogs etc.)<br />A female friend of mine has openly told me that she will never have the chance to feel what an orgasm is like due to Genital Mutilation that was forced on her as a child (without local anaesthetic).<br /><br />If you agree with me, please +1 for stating what most of the UK think, but don&#039;t have the chance to without fear of getting stabbed by a gang of muslims who disagree.

				I can&#039;t help but think they aren&#039;t as serious as the video suggests they are lol. At least they aren&#039;t resorting to violence. But still, it&#039;s stupid and pointless to do something like this.

				Adianexi, I realised you couldn&#039;t have gave me the - since you dont have 100 posts yet. hence my + for misjudging.<br />I do ramble on when im ope&#039;d. I should probably edit that post. heh<br /><br />For someone who&#039;s probably never been drunk or stoned to go around pouring away peoples hard earned booze, I think they&#039;re &quot;pretty serious.&quot;<br />That rule is only enforced in the borough of Westminster, by police.<br />Anyone who knows what pathetic wastes they are would just laugh at them and say &quot;Or what?&quot;<br />(one bloke even said &quot;fair enough&quot; as he walked away empty handed!!? wtf!)<br /><br />grdr, from what I&#039;ve heard lately:<br />A group of eastern european burglars are targeting houses whilst the owners are out. simmilar groups have been doing it for a number of years. (possibly Polish, Lithuanian or thereabouts. I can&#039;t say because no one knows.) <br />What used to happen is a skinny Lithuanian woman squeezes herself through cat-flaps or 13&quot;[roughly] tall bathroom windows, unlocks the door and lets the rest of them in.<br />Some of them were eventually caught.<br />But lately it&#039;s started happening again.. several houses have been done this week. things regularly go missing from our garden, including bags of rubbish, muddy shoe&#039;s left outside the front door.. allsorts.<br />Every day I see a polish guy who lives down the road walking quickly backwards and forwards daily, carrying a wheelie-bin[trashcan on wheels], black bags, etc into his house.<br />whilst he&#039;s doing so, he looks left and right almost as if to check there aren&#039;t any police around, or people watching. Very suspect behavior.<br /><br />Another e.european man goes out stealing metal pipes from peoples houses aswell as drain hole covers etc.. I know this because he asked me if I&#039;d take him to the scrapyard..<br /><br />Other than that they&#039;re quite friendly people (my opinion) and hard workers but even that&#039;s not welcome by the english working class. They take most of our jobs because they&#039;ll work all day for next to nothing, without breaks. (that&#039;s the general consensus)<br /><br />My mother got followed down an alleyway recently by a quote: &quot;foreigner&quot;, who would be walking slowly behind her. when she realised this and slowed down so he&#039;d walk past her, he slowed down even more so she looked at him and he apologised and walked away! she had a feeling that he was going to snatch her bag because it happens all too often.<br /><br />One &quot;foreign man&quot; even asked her for a light once (in the same alleyway), she said &quot;yeah, where&#039;s your fag?&quot; he said.. &quot;I don&#039;t have one, do have one I can use?&quot;<br />wtf<br /><br />There are some really beautiful places in England, but stay away from London unless you&#039;re visiting the central part. (same goes for new york. cool city but avoid the Bronx)<br />It&#039;s not that bad, you just have to keep your wits about you and never walk around at night in quiet areas on your own.

				I remember a group (6-7) of kids tried to jump me and a friend - they were all 16-18 and we were about 5 years older at the time. <br /><br />Your typical yobs, hoods, tracksuits, the &quot;what the fuck you looking at blood!?&quot;<br /><br />We had been in a very bad mood as we had met an out of towner for a large deal only to have found out we were essentially ripped off. <br /><br />I just remember the kids walking over with their fucking &quot;you, wasteman - what you looking at!?&quot; &quot;what you gonna&#039; do, blood!?&quot; expecting to mug us and take our wallets after we got a kickin&#039; or something. But... every single one of them got a severe beating.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big guy and my friend has been in to MMA since he was 9 (could probably go pro if he was to stop using drugs, but he loves them to much!

				What do British people expect? They import Muslims as part of a deliberate immigration policy, and are surprised that Muslims want to enforce Muslim values.

I have had many encounters with those asian youths, VERY similar to what happened to you, they are mouthy and the problem is, most of the time these guys are skinny and don&#039;t know that someone can be a lot stronger than them and beat them to death if they really get pissed off. Hence they sometimes carry knifes, and only walk in groups. Funny thing is, a lot of them do drink, and deal drugs then get hyped up on cheap cocaine and cause trouble. Why do you think so many of them can afford a car at 17? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I also agree with the eastern europeans, a lot of them are basically burglars and thieves. This does give us a bad name as I said I am also Polish. I know a lot of Polish people who live here, and who used to steal and do other dodgy stuff, but most of the ones I know became straight now. Of course after being in jail (some more than once) these guys are big, I am not small myself. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I got into trouble in Poland after christmas for my holidays, they put me in a cell with a guy who actually lived in Southampton stealing cars and burglary, he got caught and deported back to Poland, with a 10 year ban to not come back. (I know two others who got deported for dealing with amphetamines) I also almost missed my flight back to the UK because of what I did. I don&#039;t steal or do anything bad in the UK though (except drugs), I think its a brilliant country and I totally support benefit cuts and everything that is being done to get rid of people (mostly asians) who leech for government money, the money that we pay for through our taxes, and all they do is bring NOTHING but trouble in here. Some Poles will carry on doing their bad things until they get caught, but those that I know work really hard in here to keep their families up. (and yes most of them do work on&nbsp; construction sites so stereotypes are usually true about them :) ) I&#039;ve worked on a construction site with Russians, Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Algerians and even Saudi Arabians. Very cool guys, but some of them are still illegal here :)

I live in one of the asian capitals of the uk and I can guarantee this is a TINY minority of muslims that have anything remotely like this view point in no small part because it actually says in the koran sumwhere if they go into a country they must live by that countries laws. Sharia law is nothing to do with the koran, like wahabism* its an interpritation of some religious zealot trying pathetically make himself look more religious that next man. <br />My boss is a muslim and he sniffs coke and drinks. Another 2 muslim friends got pilled up in town with me so I can assure you there all hypocrites and its themselves that would stop sharia law even being considered. <br />As for them fighting only in crews that is true. A beefs never finished with an asian either and I can tell you for fact they use the police as weapons against each other on a regular basis. They all grass each other up for doing anything. A local hardnut asian told me he likes fighting with white guys because at least they dont call the cops and when the fights ovee thats usually the end to it.
