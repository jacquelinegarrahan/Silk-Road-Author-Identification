				Done some drugs? Feeling good, flying high? Browsing the forums? This is the thread for you 8) Share how good you feel and what you&#039;re up too!<br /><br />Smoked some killer dank at my buddies house after work, came home and popped an oxy, feeling amazing, just relaxing, watching tv and surfing the internet, enjoying a (rare) quite night cause my son is spending the night at his grandparents.
