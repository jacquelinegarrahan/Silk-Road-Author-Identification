				My wife has decided she wants to start trying to have kids. So now she&#039;s making a big deal out of not wanting me having weed around the house or smoking even in my room. If there were kids already in the house, or she was already pregnant I wouldn&#039;t be bothered by it, but as late as last week she was smoking 75% of my stash every time I reupped. She seems to think weed is only for getting high, while ignoring the fact I use it in place of pain meds and muscle relaxers the doctors keep shoving at me in spite of them not providing any relief.<br /><br />I&#039;d really like some useful information about ecigs and these cheaper personal vapes I&#039;ve been seeing lately. I know the ecigs require the drug component to be made into a screw on refill type thing, but I have no idea about what constitutes a good one, what features to look for, or potency of this delivery method along with how long a refill cartridge even lasts. <br /><br />I was also noticing some of the personal vapes that have been popping up lately. I&#039;m assuming these are made for BHO, but do they work for wax and budder as well? I&#039;m also a bit clueless about what to look for and avoid in these and could use some info and advice.<br /><br />Ideally I need to find a way to medicate in such a way that I can sit on my back porch in broad daylight without attracting attention via smell or the sight of a spliff/bong in hand. I considerred trying to switch to edibles but I happen to be one of those people who doesn&#039;t really get much out of eddibles when I take them. I&#039;ve bought cookies before from SR that I didn&#039;t feel a thing off of, yet the other three people that ate them were couchlocked for hours. So any input you folks could provide would be greatly appreciated.<br />

				My roommate bought a 60$ vape that doubled as an alarm clock (sorry, don&#039;t remember the name).&nbsp; Anyway, when i&#039;ve been out i&#039;ve noticed that people smoking the e-cigs are very easy to spot out when smoking weed.&nbsp; It puts down the smell a bit but not enough to not be noticed (not sure if quality ones are better at masking).&nbsp; If you do choose to buy a 60$ vape, you can use wax and weed.&nbsp; On the nicer end are the volcano vapes (~$600USD) where you can buy a giant air bag and just fill it up to smoke and carry around, yet it isn&#039;t too inconspicuous.&nbsp; I would look into a high quality e-cig, or look into trying out some cannabis lip balm :)&nbsp; Sorry that there is not to much useful information, but good luck!

				There are plenty of options out there for this, but it all depends on how much you&#039;re going to spend and what you&#039;re going to be filling it w/.&nbsp; If you have access to BHO, I&#039;d suggest one of the following (in order from most to least expensive).<br /><br />- Thermovape&#039;s new line called Cera.&nbsp; There&#039;s a pretty much bomb-proof, and the best portable vaporizer I&#039;ve ever used by miles.&nbsp; They have carts available for concentrates, tincture, and flower that you can purchase separately - you get one of the 3 with your first order.<br /><br />- If you need maximum portability, either an Atmos Raw or G-Pen mini will do the trick.&nbsp; These are tiny, all-in-one solutions that won&#039;t give you any hassle, but also won&#039;t give you many options.<br /><br />- If you want to save some money and get what I think is a better setup than an Atmos/G-Pen, e-mail Thermovape and ask if they still have the parts to build you a LV (low voltage) Revolution cartridge for concentrates.&nbsp; They ran out of the properly branded parts, so it will say the wrong model but functions the same as the ones they used to sell.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to choose between Dart or Window style for loading the cart.&nbsp; Dart splits in half w/ a dabber on the mouthpiece end and open chamber leading down to the ceramic element on the battery end, while window is a two layer stainless steel outer sleeve that rotates to reveal a window above the ceramic element.&nbsp; I prefer the Dart, but it&#039;s all personal preference.&nbsp; This will cost about $50, and it can by screwed onto any e-cig batter that has a 510 threading - which is pretty much all of them.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have access to concentrates, your best bet is probably to just buy an ego twist or vision variable voltage battery (these both are variable voltage, and have ego as well as 510 threadings - both the main standards) and purchase pre-filled carts on SR.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t normally suggest pre-filled, but IMO most of the oil on SR looks like rubbish and it wouldn&#039;t make much of a difference which you went with.

				You can buy an ecig for around $40 and use it with oil (BHO or CO2). Its much cheaper than buying something specifically made for cannabis. Make sure you get one with a wick though if you are going to put oil in it. PM me for recommendations.<br /><br />I use it all the time and its super discreet. I do it right out in the open in very public places and no one has any idea. If they ask what it is I just tell them its an ecig, because it is ;D<br />&nbsp;<br />Also the battery charges via USB, which being the nerd I am, I find really neat 8)
