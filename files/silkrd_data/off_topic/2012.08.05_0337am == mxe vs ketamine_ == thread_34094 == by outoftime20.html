				There was a period were I couldn&#039;t get any K at all (for about 4 months) so I started using MXE and went through quite a bit, but it wasn&#039;t anywhere near as nice as ketamine.<br /><br />Since I&#039;ve got access to ketamine again I don&#039;t bother with MXE anymore.. gone off all research chemicals now to be honest reason being nobodys got a fucking clue what they&#039;re doing to you in the long run.<br /><br />I&#039;d say MXE is okay in small doses but will fuck you up in higher doses and in &#039;my&#039; opinion is most of the time horrible. Ketamine is great and even if you do get too fucked up you will probably enjoy being in that state and even if you don&#039;t everything will normalize within an hour but if you get too fucked up on MXE your brains gonna feel frazzled probably (that&#039;s what it felt like with me anyways).<br /><br />Despite my negativity towards MXE the one thing I did love about it was the closed eye visuals, they were great with some slow music playing in the headphones.

				Ive tried mxe but never k. I enjoyed mxe and it helped greatly with my depression. It also seems more cost effective because the high is longer.<br />Could ketamine also be helpful for depression beyond just the point when you are high?

				I&#039;ve tried MXE, but not ketamine. I didn&#039;t really like MXE all that much. I found it near impossible to find a good correlation between dose size and effects. One time I did a little bit and I had to lie down while panting, and another time I did a bunch and didn&#039;t feel much of anything.<br /><br />When I did whatever the perfect amount was, though, it was nice. Laid down and listened to &quot;Oracular Spectacular&quot; by MGMT while having intense flashbacks of my childhood.

You have enough time to move around your house and clean up your &quot;mess&quot; ie the needle, put the vial away, etc and alcohol swab the injection site again. Then you can go lie down and turn off the lights and up the music while it sets in. More BA than oral, so you waste less of it too. I did 100mg my first IM time based on usual oral dosage and it ended up a bit stronger than I liked.

				i was a long time moderate user of ketamine, but have really taken a liking to MXE.&nbsp; lately i just don&#039;t crave the &quot;rush&quot; of ketamine and prefer the mild nature of MXE.&nbsp; i will say, though, that i don&#039;t think i&#039;d enjoy MXE nearly as much as i do if the doors to my imagination weren&#039;t blown off by ketamine.&nbsp; now that ketamine has done its work on my mind, i can use the extra imagination to fuel my mxe trips.<br /><br />i must say, though, that i&#039;m really light handed with the MXE.&nbsp; i do it in 15-20mg increments over a few hours.&nbsp; haven&#039;t experienced any sort of &quot;M-hole&quot; that people talk about, but i don&#039;t think i care to try.&nbsp; i find once i get up to 45-60mg of MXE in my body, i feel like i&#039;m on the border of feeling physically unwell.&nbsp; plus, its hard to imagine anything being as fantastical as a full on K hole.<br /><br />both are good, IMO, but on totally different levels.
