				It was brought to my attention the other day that it&#039;s odd, given my circumstances, that I don&#039;t have a bed.&nbsp; I&#039;m not bad off, it just never occurred to me that I needed one as the floor is actually quite comfortable. Compound that with the fact that I don&#039;t have a stove/oven or microwave and I was basically told my living situation was terrible.&nbsp; :-\ But it&#039;s not, I just don&#039;t see much reason to own these things as I get by just fine without them. <br /><br />So it got me wondering, what creature comforts do you guys willingly do without, either for practicality or not seeing the necessity? How much do you suppose culture influences the way one thinks about items they &quot;must&quot; possess?&nbsp; &nbsp;???

				If you live comfortably enough and have everything you NEED and your happy then props to you mate, but personally, without knowing any different i would just be feeling sorry for myself if i lived like that. But you clearly have enough to live with. Meh, i dont know really.<br />

				I could very happily live in the wilderness without any amenities, in fact it&#039;s a dream of mine to take a 3 month hiatus and spend it living in some remote location.<br /><br />Things in life are just there to make it easier and/or more enjoyable, not a true necessity. I need a bed so I don&#039;t have chronic back problems or trouble sleeping. I need a fridge to keep my beer cold. I have lived without an oven, well I had one but lived in a house with 3 other guys and we *NEVER* cooked anything - but then we lived on takeout and pizza, which meant we used the microwave frequently.<br /><br />Years ago, I could have lived without a television, since I read a lot. But the last several years have seen the quality of my weed increase so dramatically that &#039;getting high&#039; and reading is an impossibility - I&#039;ve moved on to audio books now, the intellectual stoner method lol.<br /><br />I could NOT survive without air conditioning though, in a warm climate. I get so extremely cranky when I&#039;m hot, I would end up either killing myself or someone else for the smallest infraction.

				That&#039;s an eccentric way to live. How do you cook your food or do you live off of junk food and take-out? Do you at least have a hotplate or something?<br /><br />I do without TV. I do without a lot of things actually, but mostly it&#039;s just the random crap most other people accumulate. My room is very bare. But I do have the essentials (lamp, garbage can, bed, night stand, dresser and a trunk full of liquor, drugs and drug paraphernalia).

				Well even though I have a TV I never use it In fact it&#039;s been at least 3 weeks since I even turned it on (And that was when I had friends over. I have all I need on the net, games, forums, movies and now a drug dealer ;) People think you need a TV and a computer, na with a big enough monitor you don&#039;t need a TV. <br /><br />Should sell my TV to get&nbsp; a few grams of some good quality coke ;)

				Can definitely live without a TV. My only must haves would be a comfy bed, fridge, laptop and a good sound system. I guess a stove as well since I&#039;m not rich enough to eat out everyday.

				I don&#039;t have a TV, because I&#039;ve never bothered buying one, and the shows I do like, I just watch on hulu or netflix.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a microwave because I don&#039;t trust the dirty little bastards.<br /><br />I used to sleep on a therm-a-rest (a backpacking pad) because I found it more comfortable, but when I got married my wife wanted a bed. So I have one of those now.<br /><br />Those are really more eccentricities, and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m doing without. In general, I try to make myself as comfortable as I can.<br /><br />I can&#039;t do without my hammock, hookah, and vinyl records/sound system

				If we&#039;re talking about things we can do without, I gotta go with the internet (for porn and the silk road), drugs, music and... that&#039;s about it. If I had all of those things I&#039;d be happy enough to keep moving on.

				I&#039;ve spent months homeless on the street in Phoenix (far away from that godforsaken place now) and lost all/most of my material possessions twice.<br /><br />All I have was given to me for free by those who saw I had nothing. I was fine with nothing, or more accurately close to nothing - all I need is something to rest my head on, something to let out my creativity, and my friends, as far as luxuries are concerned. I of course need food and clothing, etc. like anyone else.
