				DMT is by far my most favorite drug. Ive done it while on MDMA, LSD, and Shrooms. Last night I took around 240ug of LSD and figured I would add some DMT to the mix after about 3 hours. The last time I did them both at the same time, I smoked 40mg of DMT (not enough to fully break through) and the second I exhaled my entire room became crowded with ghost-people and the walls started flashing different colors. There were two people sitting on my bed, a couple sitting on the floor, and a few more looking out the window. I walked around my room staring at these ghosts everywhere, I would blink and they would not go away. It was the coolest thing I had every seen on a trip and I was howling with laughter and smiling the whole time, some of them got up off my bed and started dancing beside me to the music. Full silhouettes of humans dancing beside me while I was fully conscious! <br /><br />I figured I would get something similar this time around, but oh no. Every DMT trip is different. I eyeballed a small amount and packed a bowl. After clearing the entire bong, I held my breath for 10 seconds and exhaled (no smoke came out so it was all absorbed). I jumped onto my bed and closed my eyes, all I had was some mild colorful squiggly lines bouncing around in the dark so I hopped back up and packed another bowl. I did the same thing again and only had a mild body high and a few more squiggly lines.<br /><br />Frustrated, I filled the bowl up and tried one last time. It was a ridiculously&nbsp; large amount of smoke but I managed to hold it in for about 6-7 seconds. Suddenly my entire mouth tasted like DMT and I got a huge body buzz, when I exhaled no smoke came out and I tasted even more chemical in my mouth. I immediately went back to my bed and closed my eyes.<br /><br />I felt a massive smile come on my face and I started seeing a colorful cartoon-world of colors appearing. Rainbows were bouncing all over the place to the beat of the music in the background and I watched as more silhouettes began riding waves of liquid-rainbows all over the place. I had never seen so many vibrant, beautiful colors in my life. Shooting stars began streaming across my vision and mountains of various shapes and colors began shooting out of the ground as I floated by them, I saw more people sliding down the mountains and disappearing into the white mist below them.<br /><br />After what appeared to be 6-7 minutes the colors began stop die down and I was only seeing a variety of different pictures and shapes appearing, after 11 minutes I only had a body high and my vision was still fucked from the acid. This was one of the best DMT trips Ive had so far.<br /><br />Anyone else experiment with DMT on any other substances and have great experiences? So far LSD + DMT is my all-time favorite. Every time I do it something incredible happens

				Have always been loathe to mix dmt with anything, on a bit of a purist tip I guess. Oh, and a bit concerned that the &#039;entities&#039; might disapprove :)<br /><br />Reading all these positive experiences might be nudging mein the direction of giving it a blast though.

				I had a DMT trip a while ago while I was on 2g of Lemon-Tekk&#039;d cubensis. It was around 3pm and it was sunny outside with no clouds in the sky, the birds were chirping and there was a nice breeze too. I was out on the back deck and I sat down in a lawn chair and smoked 60mg. When I closed my eyes I was thrown into a massive square room with bright different colored walls which would change their color to the beat of the music in the background. I actually had a fast Electronic song going so they were switching colors at an insanely fast pace. I couldn&#039;t feel anything but myself smiling while this was all going on.<br /><br />After what seemed like 30 seconds of me standing in this colorful room, it instantly filled up with hundreds of dancing people (none of which I could see their faces). the room started spinning and the people seemed to hover in mid air still dancing when the whole room exploded into an array of colorful cubes and all the cubes dissolved into mist.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember the rest after that, I always seem to forget part of a shrooms trip. But seriously, when I&#039;m on any psychedelic the DMT breakthroughs are always filled with colors! Any time I do DMT sober its just a rush of images, memories, patterns and shapes. Its a lot more fast pace (and fun!) when you have something else to add to the mix.<br /><br />In the dozens of times Ive done DMT Ive never had a single bad trip on it. I just love it so much I guess. I had Addy&#039;s big crystal DMT shards a while back and that stuff was amazing. I just wish he still sold it, I would jump on that in a heartbeat and order 5g if I could.

				Title: <strong>MDMA + 5-MeO-DMT combo, fucking incredible</strong><br />

				I was rolling balls a year ago on Chemical Brothers grey-white MDMA, and smoked a blast of 5-MeO. <br /><br />Like the OP, I got weak ass hits the first time, thinking &quot;wtf&quot; ... &quot;this has always worked before..&quot;<br /><br />So my boy goes, &quot;You want to REALLY blast off, huh?&quot; and dumps some ridiculous amount, 130-150 MG prob. of 5-meo(only need 20mg to blast).<br />I ripped a HUGE bowl of 5-meo-soaked Master Kush(from a vendor on here). I held it in, started counting backwards from 15... 14.... 13... looking over at my boy, who is just staring at me grinning... and I&#039;m like &quot;I don&#039;t get it... this shit ain&#039;t working...&quot; <br /><br />All of the sudden, I&#039;m looking through my 5th floor apartment window in my living room... looking INTO my living room, watching me lay back and giggle... and watching my boy, and my GF watching me... then I felt this vacuum... jjust absolutely insane gravitational pull on my spine.... working its way up to my head.... my whole world was shifting! At the time I lived in NYC, and i vividly remember seeing the Freedom Tower on my way out of this world... and all the lights of downtown Manhattan just screaming their goodbyes.<br /><br />My visual plane at this point was what I can only describe as &quot;warp speed&quot;, flying through space on a magic carpet... backwards. The Earth... our Sun... our solar system... our galaxy... the universe... kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller while this noise was growing louder and louder and louder, til it was everything in me and around me. And then THAT is when I saw this ever-revolving machine, like some strange alien technological advancement my brain couldn&#039;t comprehend. IT was twisting and turning and making everything move outward. It was bigger, AND smaller than anything I had ever seen until a large blue figure appeared before me. A woman. She insisted(despite my fears) that I needed to &quot;come with&quot; her.... and by that, she meant, &quot;be eaten by her&quot; ...<br /><br />She swallowed me up, and I went back into hyper space.... zipping left, right, up and down... <br /><br />I landed on my feet for the first time; I thought the experience was over. It surely felt like I woke up... but alas, I was on a land I did not know. The grass was purple, but gleaming gold in the sunlight. The sun was also sort of a purple color, and the sky was distinctly red. There were trees, and water, and people... not humanoid... but people I could not comprehend. I don&#039;t recall voices, or anything of this world... but I remember thinking that these were my friends. They were treating me like they had been long awaiting my arrival... they were all standing on the banks of this pond made of energy; and light. Looking down pointing out the flaws of humanity... trying to show me where we all come from (this big white light)... <br /><br />Before I knew it, I was being sucked away again. Such a force; I cannot explain. <br /><br />This is the last thing I remember.... The Machine... and the woman faded away; and they instilled sadness in me. They told me(not in words) that to live; is to be, to feel, to experience, to acknowledge, and to grow. To die is to bring back stored knowledge of the physical realm back to, I guess what people refer to as &quot;God&quot; ... or &quot;Heaven&quot; ... whatever... for it to also grow. It&#039;s a big cycle. And we&#039;re all washed of the lives we lived; cleansed of our memories, and experiences, good or bad. And that energy, good or bad, grows. Perhaps this is where the concepts of Heaven and Hell came from...<br /><br />...shortly, and I mean IMMEDIATELY after I got this &quot;vibe&quot; and &quot;thought&quot; in me, I felt this tremendous weight. Kind of like the space-vacuum I felt before, but this was markedly stronger. It was life... sucking me back. It was the Earth... calling me by name. Everything got pitch black, there was nothing nowhere, forever. I felt pain, regret, sorrow, remorse, terror.... I felt like I was on fire... and being suffocated...&nbsp; but I regained consciousness just moments later... to my girlfriend calling my name, wiping my face down with cool wet rags, panicking...<br /><br />They said I was under for 40-45 minutes, having what they could only describe as &quot;a Grand Mal seizure&quot; or &quot;Epilepsy&quot; or something. When I was regaining my awareness, everything was green and purple and trails.... and I felt like I just shot a mega-dose of heroin and cocaine mixed. Like... SO insanely good. A complete contrast to just a moment prior.<br /><br />Some super scary shit, and I&#039;ve only been smoking N,N, DMT since.... and not going anywhere near as close as that^, even on multiple big hits. <br /><br />MDMA gave me the balls to do so much. I don&#039;t think I could ever go back there... until I die.<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d share.&nbsp; :D

				I tried 5-MeO-Dmt before, I had a quarter gram of it and wanted to see what it was like. The first time I tried it I was actually on about 400ug of LSD haha (I love me some good acid). It freaked me out how hard and fast it hit. Out of no where the whole center-point of my vision just started wiggling and vibrating, and my heart started fucking racing out of my chest. I started sinking down into the floor and pretty much didnt move for about 20 minutes.<br /><br />I tried it a bunch of times after that, but the come-up on it is very weird and not necessarily nice. After the 60-second period where your heart starts beating at twice the rate, its somewhat enjoyable. I haven&#039;t used it since and I don&#039;t plan on ever reusing it.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t imagine that shit is very good for your heart in the long-run too. Could be wrong though :P

Though, it was also bliss. <br /><br />lol<br /><br />Shit is weird. First time i told some hippy that I smoked 5-meo he goes &quot;Dude, that&#039;s like smoking dmt and crack, combined.&quot; I&#039;m afraid to ever try it again. I love NN now tho.
