				Not really, I got pulled over for swerving like 1 inch, the cop thought I was high &amp; asked to search my car, instead went through my purse &amp; found a bunch of drugs. The dumbass didn&#039;t write a probable cause report thing, so I was released sunday with only 2 misdemeanors &amp; I refused to speak with any LEO until I had a lawyer present. It&#039;s been 3 days and still no report has been written, it&#039;s bullshit. I have an excellent lawyer &amp; bondsman though, so I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t have to spend anymore time in jail.<br /><br />I got the drugs from SR, but so far I&#039;ve not mentioned SR...

				6 felonies from a &quot;bunch of drugs&quot; in your purse? Must&#039;ve been nothing BUT drugs in that purse for 6 felonies. I guess driving while high is one... did you have minors in the car too or something?

				I had a bunch of drugs, but I guarantee there was less than 0.2g of each drug (aside from some pills &amp; 1g of weed).. It&#039;s what I get for not having a safe place to keep all my shit..<br /><br />&amp; no, heisenburg wasn&#039;t there to witness it all, but I had placed an order that night &amp; when I got home on sunday I cancelled it and had updated my page, so I assume that&#039;s what he meant lol..

				Definitely rooting for you PricillaMarie! Don&#039;t tell those pigs shit, make those trained liars prove it themselves! :) :)<br /><br />RC chems are hard to match by GC/MS unless they know ahead of time if thats what it was, if thats what it was..<br />Also, I&#039;m pretty sure a warrant is required to search a purse unless he already had probable cause to believe there was drugs in said purse...I suppose if he could prove you were high, but idk your particular situation. If you have a good lawyer, I&#039;d love to see that cop testify in court:)<br /><br />GOOD LUCK!<br />-NS

				You all have no idea how much your support means to me!<br />I took a drug test to prove I wasn&#039;t driving under the influence, so they weren&#039;t able to charge me with DUI. My lawyer got my bond from $50,000 to $12,000 with 3 of my felony charges dropped, so things are looking better. :)<br /><br />The cops in this town are so pathetic and ignorant, I never expected to be treated so badly for doing absolutely NOTHING. They handcuffed me to a door for 2 hours before actually putting me in jail and 2 policemen harassed me the entire time, swearing at me, calling me names &amp; treating me like garbage. I thought I knew how fucked the system was before this incident, but wow.. I&#039;ve never hurt anyone, I&#039;m not a malicious person, I&#039;ve never even gotten a speeding ticket.. It&#039;s not fair to label me as this worthless scum and make me feel like trash for minding my own god damn business.<br /><br />But I guess without &quot;people like me&quot;, police officers might have to actually find REAL criminals, and that&#039;s just too much! :P<br />Sorry about my rant, I just feel like I have suffered a great injustice &amp; there&#039;s nothing I can do about it! Hahah :)

				^^^ If they harassed and humiliated you, have you thought of filing a complaint, talking to a journalist or a lawyer?<br /><br />I know sometimes it&#039;s better just to forget an incident and not escalate it, but sometimes one has to fight back.......<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Lawyers<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve known about 5-6 people who were training to be cops or were in cop school&nbsp; and all of them were asswipes and a pain in the ass to work with. Yeah I worked with these people. The one common trait they all had was an overwhelming superiority complex. <br /><br />Not all policemen go out of their way to shit on people but most do and WILL because that&#039;s just a part of the personality. I did work with this girl once who was an absolute sweetheart (but cop in training)&nbsp; She&#039;s a policewoman now and hopefully she took deputy douchebag&#039;s job. <br /><br />ps. I respect all law enforcement&nbsp; but secretly I do enjoy watching police getting beat down by rioters. And once I had a dream that I was sitting in my car, using mind-control to make cops shoot at each other. With apples on their heads.
