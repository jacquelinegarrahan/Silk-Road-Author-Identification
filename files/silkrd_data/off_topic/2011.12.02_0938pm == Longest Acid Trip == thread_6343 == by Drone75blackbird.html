				Last New Years I took 3 hits of an unknown quantity (because it wasn&#039;t coming on within a minute, we just kept taking the doses; needless to say we didn&#039;t know what we were doing as it was our first time haha). Long story short, we tripped from something like 1 AM to 10 PM the next night. Then I read this quote from Albert Hofmann&#039;s LSD My Problem Child-<br /><br />&quot;But an LSD inebriation, even with the highest doses, lasts no longer than twelve hours, and repeated ingestion leads to tolerance, which means that extra doses are ineffective.&quot; (Hofmann 40)<br /><br />Dose anyone else agree that they have tripped on acid longer than 12 hours and perhaps the Father of LSD is wrong on this point? What is the longest acid trip you&#039;ve had, and what amount of micrograms did it take to get you there (if known)?&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;ve personally never tripped for that long but an old friend of mine once called me crying during hour 26 of what he described as a &quot;29 hour trip from hell.&quot; I don&#039;t know the exact dosage that he took, but he did snort 20mg of adderall at the beginning of the trip which could have contributed to the longevity, but I have no clue how such a small dose could keep him up for so long. I&#039;m guessing that it wasn&#039;t even acid that he was tripping on but some RC sold as acid. He hasn&#039;t been able to touch a hallucinogen since then, messed him up pretty bad.

				i feel terribly for your friend magicman - that sounds awful. <br /><br />it makes me wonder if perhaps i had some RC instead of LSD but it did fit on normal sized blotters (i know acid isn&#039;t the only thing that is effective at a blotter dose but still) and it did seem to mirror many of the effects of acid as i have done it around 4-5 times since then (variety of sources). <br /><br />thanks for your input travelling - i am somewhat bummed that the limit seems to be 12 hours but also curious now as to what i was tripping on if that is the case.

				Was there a really long come-up time?&nbsp; If so it was probably DOC or DOB.
