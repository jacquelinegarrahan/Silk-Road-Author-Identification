				doesnt a vaccuum seal &quot;vaccuum&quot; the smell out of it pretty much then make it air tight to the smell wont leave? unless the seal is broken i dont see how the smell would come out randomly, but i could 100% be wrong

				I have heard, that after 3 days the smell can permeate through the seal. I don&#039;t see how this is possible if you suck all the air out and vac seal it 3x.<br /><br />I could be wrong of course.

				a dog can still smell weed after a triple vac seal, Immediately<br />when we ship on here we aren&#039;t looking to try and fool drug dogs. we want to fool Postal inspectors!<br />so yeah after a few days in transit some P.I. might smell that herb.<br />But as far as vacuum sealing for protection against Drug Dog detection. Pretty S.O.L.<br />but then again in the US they cant just randomly put a dog on the mail so WOO
