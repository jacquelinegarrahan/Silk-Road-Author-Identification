				I thought I&#039;d try it out.&nbsp; Any thoughts before, I see the shadow people and eat the faces off strangers.&nbsp; I might serial hump people in the street too.&nbsp; Sounds fun.&nbsp; I like the story about rubbing your genitals until they bleed down to a stump.&nbsp; &nbsp;C&#039;mon, it can&#039;t be that bad..&nbsp; .(can it?)<br /><br />Psychosis is never fun, but I don&#039;t get it off meth and amp binges.&nbsp; and I go hard.. . we&#039;ll see .&nbsp; Great vendors BTW here who sell it.

				mdpv is in a different league (different universe even) when it comes to psychosis induction. <br /><br />Not having had it from meth/amp binges means fuck all unfortunately as this is a different beast altogether. Have a good irl mate who is still recovering from a 3 day binge and subsequent psychiatric hospital stay 3 months after the event.<br /><br />Go for it by all means but please do plenty of research first and limit the possibilities of carnage. Be well.

				Enjoy. It&#039;s a fun ride.<br /><br />The psychosis is every bit as fucked up as you have heard, but in my opinion well worth it. Try to keep dosage small and resist the urge to just keep bumping. That might not be possible, but at least try. <br /><br />Two disclaimers...<br /><br />1) Don&#039;t mix and match on MDPV. Pepper is fucked up all on it&#039;s own. But it&#039;s manageable. If you start adding substances, you go off the rails real quick. <br /><br />2) The psychosis is subtle at first. You are going to think you found the motherload of awesome drugs. And that everything is fine. The shadow people will drift in slowly, so at first you will just pass it off. By the time you have a break, it will be a big one. But as fucked as that experience will be, it will be mind opening as long as you can attribute it to the MDPV and not believe any of the shit you think while you are on it. I have a friend who went bat shit. In one of his hour and a half showers while on a pv binge he had the eureka moment that all of his troubles were caused by a friend of his who hit him with a bat in 5th grade, 27 years earlier. <br /><br />Don&#039;t believe the MDPV.<br /><br />But don&#039;t buy the hype either. It&#039;s a good ride.
