				at 7 am sunday july the 8th my wife died in her sleep. she was 19. just married in march and we been a couple for 4 going on 5 years.<br />she loved me and i loved her... we lived in a car and under a bridge we also lived in a 3 bedroom house on the lake. we have been through everything together. <br />she kept me from killing myself and i gave her everything she never got from her family including love. <br /><br />i miss her with all my heart and idk what to do...<br />i protected her and provided for her no matter what it took, even if that meant stealing food to survive or buying her a brand new car for our anniversary.<br /><br />when i found her i thought she was sleeping.. i always loved to watch my baby sleep she looked so precious. but then i noticed something was wrong... she wasnt breathing! i rolled her over and started cpr like a madman waiting on 911 to get there. but it was too late... just like that in an instant my life was in shambles and upside down. <br /><br />i&#039;m in soo much pain... i just wish i could have her again, i dont understand why she had to go =,(&nbsp; why did she have to die so young... and we think she may have been pregnant too.

Also I am the last person to be a grammar Nazi... it was about your lack of spelling and your overall shitty post. But I addressed that in the actual post. Also name one thing I was full of shit about? You won&#039;t be able to since I am not. And don&#039;t act like I would ever do business with you..lol..nice try. You have been a vendor for 3 months and&nbsp; have not sold 1 thing. So don&#039;t say things like &quot;except business&quot; you and I will never have business. And I am glad you can tell I have a sense of humor. You should have realized that and not commented on me in this thread.<br /><br />Now about your answer to the OP...&nbsp; Your words were so great. I am sure you gave him comfort in this tough time.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s assume his story is not... then what is your advice?<br /><br />And instead of wasting your time with your shitty advice, spend some time on fixing your listings and working on your spelling. So you can actually sell some items on SR. And take the last piece of advice you gave our dear friend pryat13 during his grieving times......Get the fuck out of here...rapidly... before I open my mouth and expose more of what an idiot you are.

				whys everyone gotta be hatin, yo? maybe the OP just needed to vent. rxking that was very shitty of u but this is an anonymous forum so its easy to have balls of steel. IRL everyones different though. <br /><br />OP i hope u find the strength and courage to move on. one thing i&#039;ll agree with is that this place is not the place to go looking for support. if u get it then great, but there are alot of insensitive people who act like nothing bad or tragic could ever happen to them. you&#039;re not asking for bitcoins or any charity, just looking for a place to cry, i get it. too bad there are jerks out there that make this place the wrong place to look for a shoulder. I love SR and there is alot of positive vibes here but every now and then i am brutily reminded of the nature of an anonymous forum where people just sling mud because they can. <br /><br />take care everyone. love &amp; happiness to all.

				Yeah i have to agree.&nbsp; On one hand you shouldnt be posting a personal vent on here, but on the other you have to feel sorry for the guy.&nbsp; If he needs help he should seek out to get it.&nbsp; You cannot exactly rely on positive info on a board of anonymous people.<br />So i guess what i am saying to all those out there who have had bad shit happen is, if you want to talk about it, fine, but posting one message and then getting the fuck out of doge isnt the way to deal with things.

				as u talk about business you get an answer.<br /><br />We realised we will become vendor here and in this second bought an vendor account..and since then prepared our op.<br /><br />maybe spelling is not a problem for you. <br />&nbsp;<br />English is not our native language. Also we use an custom liberte linux running on an vps on the other side of the planet in a virtualbox within in BSD nix acessed via remote desktop (2 hops) so we can answer nearly from everywhere.Thats why grave misspellings can occur ..which we cannot correct all the time.<br /><br />Also we already sold 15 samples and reviews pour in from today (sent yesterday).<br /><br />for the sell side..only our processes, response times,packaging and product must be correct..<br /><br />not our spelling or anything else.<br /><br />but i assume you will order anyway under another name in the next months..because we can stay at par for a long long time..<br />we put 3 month thought in nearly everything...not like you who doesnt understand bitcoin and still has his signature filled with long gone listings..<br /><br />to the op -&gt;<br /><br />Sorry&nbsp; for hijacking your thread--we will leave it now.<br /><br />

				Sure man, just check under your posts, and go through the pages. Man, I got a shop too, but I don`t consider it to be in business with 0 transactions/feedback.&nbsp; ::) You also gotta stop using &#039;we&#039; every time you post. Its just you behind the pc, unless we`re talking about 5 buck-naked people huddled behind a small screen....<br /><br />Also both of you need to learn how to use the &#039;quote&#039; feature.&nbsp; :P

IRL everyones different though. <br /><br />OP i hope u find the strength and courage to move on. one thing i&#039;ll agree with is that this place is not the place to go looking for support. if u get it then great, but there are alot of insensitive people who act like nothing bad or tragic could ever happen to them. you&#039;re not asking for bitcoins or any charity, just looking for a place to cry, i get it. too bad there are jerks out there that make this place the wrong place to look for a shoulder. I love SR and there is alot of positive vibes here but every now and then i am brutily reminded of the nature of an anonymous forum where people just sling mud because they can. <br /><br />take care everyone. love &amp; happiness to all.

And I hardly think it took balls to say what I did.<br /><br />I was hands down the nicest as you can now see. And I was being totally sarcastic. There was ZERO chance this was true.<br /><br />Every single person on here knew what was going to come of this. ALL OF US!<br /><br />I have to say that I did really laugh out loud when I was reading this from the OP and got to Bud&#039;s post. <br /><br />@Bungee54&nbsp; I told you not to make the comments you did in this post. You don&#039;t need to explain English is your second or 5th language. Though I will say it was not hard to figure out. So since it is, don&#039;t say 90% of the things you try and say. And you totally hijacked this thread. Not that anyone gives a shit. But like I said in the3rd post, comment on the other thread you started. Not in here. I mean it is not even in this forum! And since you haven&#039;t figured it out yet, I will not be buying from you. I only have 1 account and I do not make purchases.If I was going to(I am not) I Especially wouldn&#039;t from Germany. And II would like a vendor that spoke English and didn&#039;t have such a thin skin. But I do hope you do well. SR needs more vendors. Just be a good one and get your shit out fast. And stay good. We do not need any more shitbags.<br /><br />Sorry everyone reading this I had to say that.<br /><br /><br />Now back to Perky and his dead wife.<br /><br />This guy writes way to good to be Perky(and he he terrible) though it could be. I love that some people actually believed this scumbag had a wife. If he did... we would all understand her death.<br /><br />It would have been a suicide.

				Sorry Pyrat13 but I have no reason to believe you. You`re selling your wife`s honor on SR, and claim that you just want to cover the cost of the DVDs. If you truly loved her you would post it for free and make it available to the public so that they could all genuinely offer their condolences. Your idea if real was bad and disgraceful. If you do care so much, you will make the video publicly available. If not you`ll just be another stick in the mud that fell from the tree. I`v seen videos of remembrance on Youtube and other sites before, they care about letting people know more than making money...

No, I don`t know what its like to lose a wife, but I have lost many close to me. Day before yesterday the landlady of the garden which I rent passed away. She was 96 and came to garden everyday, and for someone that old she was really open minded and accepting. If I were to remember her I would not make DVDs and sell them, I would just reminiscence the good times and tell others about it. I do not care of your appearance or how you live. I am not ready to believe you. You aren`t even reading what I`m writing, just diverting my suspicions. <br /><br />If your wife passed away and you`re here wasting your time selling DVDs of her be ashamed. You`re making selling the DVDs a priority over her life. I can honestly say you`re a liar, when someone you know dies you don`t rage/post threads about it, especially so soon. You`re wasting your own and everybody`s time by doing this. I don`t have the strength to waste on posts like this, its common sense not to do what your doing.<br /><br />Just go away. You`re shaming everyone by creating such a scene.

				ignore the trolls. i know it hurts losing a loved one, but everything happens for a reason. she has returned to the source and you will see her again someday, believe it or not. matter cannot be created or destroyed, it is simply transformed. try to live in the light, it&#039;s what she&#039;d want you to do. take solace in the fact that her energy will always be with you, and you can access it at anytime.

				What a fucking weird thread:<br /><br />1.) Assuming you&#039;re telling the truth, why would a bunch of strangers want to buy a DVD of a funeral for some person they don&#039;t even know? That&#039;s like reading the obituaries every day, and then crossing out the names in your phone book to make sure it&#039;s current<br /><br />2.) It&#039;s fucking tacky to sell DVDs of your wife&#039;s funeral to anyone, even if they did know her. If you&#039;re really so concerned about the cost of it, put it on youtube for fucks sake<br /><br />3.) Are you trying to get caught as a sort of suicide by cop, or are you just a complete fucking idiot? You&#039;ve posted names, dates, etc... that could easily identify you. Oh, but wait, googling any of those things doesn&#039;t turn up a damn thing. Hmmmm<br /><br />4.) What the fuck is wrong with you? You&#039;re either telling the truth, and a tacky, insane weirdo, or you&#039;re lying, which also makes you an insane weirdo. Either way...<br /><br />
