				So I was carrying some cheeba chews in a pouch in my bag in a little baggie, and then later I noticed that there is still a noticeable (and delicious) odor in there.<br /><br />As I&#039;m will soon have a flight on which I will have some other contraband not related to pot and generally not smell-able as I understand, I realized that a dog alerting to the pot no longer in my bag would probably qualify me for a Darwin award when I got killed in some third world prison.<br /><br />Would washing all my bags and clothes with detergent and not putting any substances anywhere near them for the next several days be good enough to remove the chance of a pig-dog alerting to the smell of pot?<br /><br />What do ya&#039;ll knowledgeable types reckon?

				Wash with &gt;50% alcohol, then use water.

				vacuum seal the cheeba chews and other contraband. Wash clothes with good detergent and put in dryer with 2 quality dryer sheets. Idk how you was a suitcase but if it is a suitcase and it&#039;s that important to you I would just buy a new suitcase/luggage. I would also advise mailing to your destination rather than deal with airlines.

				I know smoked cannabis dissipates in an hour max, not sure about edibles. In my experience edibles smell more like the food then cannabis, but I obviously have never had a cheeba chew.<br /><br />My solution - Buy a new bag.<br /><br />Nothing is worth being that paranoid about in an airport imho

				Thanks.<br /><br />To be clear I will not be taking any THC-containing products with me. They&#039;re just for while I&#039;m here.<br /><br />And I won&#039;t vac-seal my other contraband because dogs are apparently never trained for it and it&#039;s visually stealthed quite well. A vac-sealed bag would seem to be way more dangerous and more conspicuous when dealing with something there is more or less no chance will be smelled for.
