				I will give away 5 btc&#039;s. <br /><br />I ordered a couple grams from PF last Saturday and am going to a concert tomorrow night. I will be so happy if I get to roll for the first time during this concert that I would like to spread the love and give away 5 coins. I&#039;m not really sure how to decide who gets it, but I guess we might as well wait till tomorrow to see if it even comes in. Anyways, just giving a heads up!

				Thanks guys! Even if it doesn&#039;t arrive for tomorrow, I&#039;m sure I can find something next weekend that MDMA would be appropriate for! I take it back, even if it doesn&#039;t arrive tomorrow I&#039;ll give away 5 coins whenever it does!

				fingers crossed for ya man!&nbsp; what type of concert? (don&#039;t have to name specific artists since it will give away location)<br /><br />Bring a pack or two of gum!!!&nbsp; I am definitely a jaw-clench-er, even with the purest MDMA.&nbsp; Vick&#039;s(I prefer a vick&#039;s inhaler as opposed to the tub o&#039; rub, as the rub fumes tends to burn my eyes a bit).&nbsp; WATER BOTTLE, STAY HYDRATED!!!!!!

				I rolled for the first time recently at a concert.&nbsp; It was the most amazing of my life.&nbsp; I hope it arrives for you, buddy, because I have to say, music was close to literally the best thing ever while rolling.<br /><br />Of course, remember to stay hydrated.&nbsp; But not too hydrated!&nbsp; Too much water can kill you (as it has for an unfortunate amount of people on MDMA).&nbsp; MDMA on its own doesn&#039;t dehydrate you or raise your temperature - you just tend to not notice because you feel so goddamned good.&nbsp; Drink only the amount of water you usually drink (or otherwise think you&#039;ll need) and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Have fun, guy.

				First off.... I know exactly what your talking about with the tits&nbsp; ;D. I do plan on rolling with some females so I&#039;ll see what I can do!<br />I also want to thank everyone again for the advice and the encouragement. It&#039;s kinda funny, the main thing I came to silk road for was to try ecstasy. I&#039;ve tried several other drugs over the course of this time but have had no luck with ecstasy (got scammed by tony, and tomorrow will be 5 weeks waiting for SKYY&#039;s pink stars. Still have faith they will come!). I hope my expectations aren&#039;t too high, but from reading others experiences, I can&#039;t help but hope that it will be one of the best experiences of my life. Anyways, sorry for rambling, but I want to show my appreciation for both the vendors of SR who make this all possible, and all you guys who are more than helpful in answering questions for newbs like me! <br />&nbsp;

				haha its better to have it on the day of your concert then a few weeks before... I had my bag of white speakers a week before &quot;THE EVENT(first time)&quot; and the amount of times i opened the bag sniffed it licked it etcetera is ridiculous.. every day i just wanted to take em but had to wait:( that time failed aswell:( started off with a quarter.. but it wasnt enough:( hour later took a half.. and 1.5 hours later i took another half but never got the euphoria.. only got the jaw clenching and _extremely_ clear vision.. could see screws on the lightning posts etc. ended up eating 350mg in like 4/5 hours time:( all for nothing.. for some energy.. now waiting 3 months before im gonna take again.. definitely gonna start with approx. 150mg @ the start. Extremely curious about ketamine aswell.. :o need to order asap!
