				Any thoughts? Takers on this topic?<br /><br />I think the prequels sucked ass to be honest. All but qui-gon jin and darth maul and lucas&nbsp; killed them both off the first movie and gave us the sonic the hedgehog yoda and&nbsp; count dooku.<br /><br />My god&nbsp; &nbsp;ten minutes of the empire strikes back was better than all three preqeul films combined

				The prequels made me cherish my childhood that much more, seeing parts IV-VI in theaters was seriously just magical back in the day. Star Wars was everywhere! I had a lot in common with Eric Forman from That 70&#039;s Show, haha! Seeing the new ones was just disappointing and totally not worth the money though. But I do agree that Darth Maul was a badass at least. ;D

				I know what you mean.&nbsp; I waited so many years for the&nbsp; &nbsp;nre trilogy and can remember the build up and when I heard that anakin was going to be 9 yrs old I was like what? you got to be kidding.&nbsp; But believe it or not out of the new ones&nbsp; &nbsp;the phantom menace was my favorite just cause of qui-gon and&nbsp; darth maul.&nbsp; attack of the clones make me gag to just&nbsp; look at.<br /><br />Emoire Strikes back and star trek 2 the wrath of khan to me&nbsp; are two of my all time favorite films

				I probably sound like an old man but I miss the golden days when they made most of the effects rather than resorting to shitty CGI for the entirety of the film. :&#039;(

				I am guessing we are the same age then or close abouts. I hate all these cgi shit.&nbsp; Jabba looked soo much more real in the 1983 version than he did in these dumb ass&nbsp; &nbsp;changes lucas keeps making&nbsp; to the originals with cgi.&nbsp; The man is nuts.<br /><br />Hell Disneys the black hole was a much better film than the&nbsp; new star wars prequels. Fuck even the last starfighter.<br /><br />what a lot of people dont understnd though is Lucas&nbsp; only directed and&nbsp; co-wrote the first star wars A New hope. I always just called it star wars and his wife marcia&nbsp; was the editor and di&nbsp; a lot of the screenplay.&nbsp; He was not involved with the empire strikes back&nbsp; hardly at all.&nbsp; Laweernece kasdan wote the screenplay. the same guy who wrote raiders of the lost arc&nbsp; and&nbsp; irvin kershner directed it.&nbsp; and gary kurtz produced it. Kurts and kasdan and kernsher were the true geniuses behind&nbsp; empire.<br /><br />All of Lucas good films he&nbsp; directed and helped write was when kurts was his right hand man and lawenrece kasdan and marcia lucas was there to help him.&nbsp; thx, american grafatti, star wars, empire strikes back, raiders of the lost arc.&nbsp; Soon as kurts&nbsp; left&nbsp; marcia left him and lucas did it all on his own like he did with the new ones they SUCKED. he wrote directed&nbsp; all three new one with no help from any talanted people and they all sucked,

I still have most of my action figures from when I was little, they bring back such good memories. ^-^ Geez, I&#039;m feeling to nostalgic....think I might have to watch the trilogy again tomorrow. Come to think of it, I&#039;m surprised I&#039;ve never tripped to Star Wars before....I&#039;m almost positive I&#039;ll cry if I watch them again on shrooms. :&#039;(
