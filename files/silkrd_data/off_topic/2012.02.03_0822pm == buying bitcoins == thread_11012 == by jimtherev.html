				I kinda&#039; agree.&nbsp; Bitcoin seems to be a real pain in the ass.&nbsp; I opened a Dwolla account doing a direct deposit from a checking account.&nbsp; From there I am going to puchase Bitcoins from Tradehill and then transfer them into my Silk Road account for my purchase.&nbsp; Be advised tho&#039; that I&#039;m also new at this so there might be a better way, although, I&#039;ve been researching it for a couple of weeks now.&nbsp; However you do it, good luck!

The funds will clear in a few hours if you use cash, certainly within 1 working day. Most major currencies are supported if you&#039;re outside the US. On mtgox you get the best market bc rates and commission is very low only 0.6%. No charge for deposits or withdrawals.
