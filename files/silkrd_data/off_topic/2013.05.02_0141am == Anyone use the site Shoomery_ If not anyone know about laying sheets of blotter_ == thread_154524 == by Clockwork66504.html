				I have heard about this epic thread that details the ins and outs of laying sheets of LSD for Cyrstal. The thread was made by a user called &#039;chinacat72&#039; on the site Shoomery. Unfortunately you have to be a member of the forum and have over a certain amount of post to be able to use this thread. Wishi I am not. Is there anybody out there that does use that site and could send me the information some how? Im sure it would be a good read. I have read chinacat72 other famous thread. &#039;The THUMBPRINT&#039; which is certainly an epic read.&nbsp; Please let me know if anyone can help,<br /><br />If not im sure there are plenty of people out there that know loads about laying sheets. Any tips on what I should be reading?&nbsp; Where can I find the relevant information? Does anyone have an effective method for getting liquid LSD evenly onto sheets? I know that this is not the way its done. It is done by starting with crystal. However those are optimum situations. What if i already have some liquid LSD is there any way to get it onto sheets without wasting any or is that just a wasteful process by nature?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for what im sure will be a wealth of knowledge far above my current understanding.<br /><br />Clockwork<br /><br />PS: Sorry if this is posted in the incorrect section, I am new to posting on the forums. Although I have been here a long time in the shadows not posting, just reading.

				Hi, <br />&nbsp;yep, I am a long term member of the Shroomery and have written many TEKs on mushroom cultivation and other bits. <br />Link me to the thread and I´ll copy it out and send it to your tormail. <br />I´´ve also laid quite a few sheets of acid in the past if you want some pointers<br /><br />ACE

				If you want it to be accurate, just use a 1ul - 100ul variable volume micropipette and do the math.&nbsp; It takes some time but it&#039;s accurate.&nbsp; Simple.

Im sure it is good quality knowledge that I would like to read over whatever. However for right now I have some liquid LSD that I want to lay to sheets. Is there a good method to lay this to a sheet without waste? And very importantly an even lay? Cause I would like if possible to make a load of tabs all at the same dose. Obviously I could just drop it out drop by drop onto the sheet but this would not really produce an accurate lay?<br /><br />Also here is my tormail...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; johnsmith992@tormail.org<br /><br />Cheers Ace<br /><br /><br />And Jack .

				Hi! <br />I take it you mean you already have the dilution at a drop, like the eyedropper bottles ready for taking. In which case I wouldn´t suggest bathing the sheet, you will lose a fair bit of acid. Bathing the sheets and weighing the retained liquid is for industrial production when you have many sheets going through the one bath. If you only have enough for one sheet you wont be able to get the liquid level high enough to immerse the entire sheet and you will get an uneven distribution. In this case if you only have enough for one or two sheets I would use the spray or drop method. The latter being most meticulate and effective. It consists of starting at the central point and moving out in a square pattern. ensuring you leave a good 4 seconds between drops. Just drop the center of each perforated square preciceley in the middle and move out in a square pattern till&nbsp; your last 4 are the 4 corner ones. leave the sheet to dry flat on an upturned clean pyrex dish. do not touch/move/expose to light etc the sheet for 48 hrs, if you want to double dose them flip it over after 48 hrs and repeat exactly<br /><br />
