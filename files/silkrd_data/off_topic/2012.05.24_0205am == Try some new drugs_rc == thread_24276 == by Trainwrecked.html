				Alright, so pretty much, I&#039;m a HUGE acid head.&nbsp; Love tripping my balls on some good LSD.&nbsp; Went thru a phase of doing tons of MDMA, but grew out of that quickly when my tolerance went way too far up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some coke, and enjoy it quite a bit.&nbsp; Same with some K.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t care much for MXE.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve tried DOC and hated it (wayyyyy too intense and made me shake too much which freaked me out).&nbsp; Looking to try some new drugs or research chems, since LSD is near impossible to find nowadays without it being ridiculously overpriced.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

				LSD Equivalent-NBO-Me at $2/tab is a pretty good research chem IMO. <br /><br />MDMA/Coke Equivalent-Methylone is another reasonably priced alternative<br /><br />Take care with the Methylone though; made me feel like shit at the end of the day

				Well, I tend to go &quot;Hard as Fuck&quot; with most drugs that I do.&nbsp; At least, what I consider hard as fuck.&nbsp; When I trip, I like to eat 4 hits of extremely strong acid, or eat like a gram of MDMA in a night.&nbsp; Or do a ball of coke.&nbsp; So like, what would be the recommended dose for those if I wanted to fully enjoy it like I do these other drugs?

And as far as NBO-Me goes, I&#039;d say tabbage is similar to acid. I&#039;ve generally loved the 2 tab experience on it, but as I don&#039;t much like to mentally fuck myself as I&#039;ve done before on large amounts of acid (haven&#039;t been the same since), I think you&#039;ll like the 3-4 tab range.

				If you want to trip balls for ages get some 2c-p&nbsp; :D<br /><br />To me there&#039;s a awkward body load with 25i , Some of my mates like this ??? <br />I found the head space of 2c-p more were I want to be it just takes forever to kick in.&nbsp;

				Yeah, I&#039;ve really been interested in DMT for quite a long time.&nbsp; Seen so many people do it, and seen lots of it, but it&#039;s wayyyyyy too expensive for my tastes.&nbsp; Hence why I&#039;m interested in Changa.&nbsp; Might buy some of that with my $23 dollars of bitcoins I&#039;ve had left for weeks in my account lmao.&nbsp; My g/f really liked 2c-b but it made her nauseous a lot.&nbsp; I tried 2c-e or 2c-i.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember which one, but I snorted it and it burned.&nbsp; Felt like a radioactive rock was lodged in my nose and kept throbbing with a chemical burn feeling.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t really get much out of it, tho.&nbsp; Felt tripped out for a couple moments, but that&#039;s it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wtf is Mephedrone?

Or eat four tabs of 25i-NBOMe. Those were some of my most intense experiences (only maybe paralleled by a few nitrous and salvia experiences way back) :D<br />Here is my report on snorting 2C-P: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23942

				4-aco-DMT my favorite drug that happens to be RC. Very visual and beautiful trips with lots of euphoria and good vibes. Comparable to shrooms without any negative body effects (nausea, body load...) :)

				Some suggestions I&#039;d make would be 2C-B, 2C-E, 25i-NBOMe, 4-AcO-DMT, or DMT. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll love all of them, so the choice is up to you.
