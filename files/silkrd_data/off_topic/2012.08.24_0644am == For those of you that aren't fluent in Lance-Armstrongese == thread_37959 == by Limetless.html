				&quot;There has to be a point where you say enough is enough and you call it a day. It&#039;s effected not only myself and my family and I just don&#039;t have it in me to deal with it anymore. I shall not be contesting this further.&quot;<br /><br />Translation done by the combined efforts of the Professors of Linguists from Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Bristol and a couple of those Ivy League Universities in America that aren&#039;t as good as them but wish they were&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; :P - <br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t want to fight this anymore because if I did a piss-test they would find that I am rammed full of roids. My roid consumption has effected my own life and my family by shrinking my penis and forcing me to see the red mist and beat my wife on a regular basis to the point where she is now permanently in a wheelchair. I shan&#039;t be lying to the world about winning the Tour de France through using the super-juice any longer but I wont admit it because I&#039;m a bit of a pussy.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s some straight-up Rosetta Stone shit that is!&nbsp; ::)

				Seriously, fuck them all.<br /><br />EVERYONE is doping in cycling, and Lance Armstrong beat them all with only 1 nut.<br /><br />He passed a couple hundred drugs tests in his career and were some covered up, then the doping commissions were complicit just the same.<br /><br />Its the same bullshit MLB tries to do with all these villians like Bonds and Clemens and Canseco ... like they weren&#039;t right there reading the test results they swept under the carpet in 2002.

				withall due respect limetless his acheived more in life with one testicle then u and the rest of us combined could acheive with 3 each, and the whole of SR&#039;s roid listings.<br /><br />Another thing you need to understand, steroids would be used in cycling, but no more then your missus/wife/fuck buddy uses so that you can bareback her without having a new kid popping out every 9 months. Anabolic steroids increase protein synthesis, make you bigger. Do you really think somebody who has to carry his weight on a piece of fibreglass for 200km a day up the swiss alps really wants to be any bigger then nessecary? NO. Exactly. <br /><br />Cycling is an endurance sport obviously, and what lance armstrong is being accused of is blood doping. Sounds preety technical doesnt it? Some amazing advance in sports science beyond the comprehension of anyone whos not an elite athlete . Infact, All it requires is a plastic bag and a fucking fridge. You take your blood out, put it in the plastic bag, wait til your body creates more blood to make up for loss of blood (no more then 24hrs), repeat as much as possible. Come race day, get blood from fridge, put as much stored blood back in your body until your on the verge of popping, and wallah! You now have a fucking enormous red-blood cell count. You now have X amount of extra oxygen going to those muscles so you can spend the next 8 hours riding up a fucking mountains with a gradient of 10% against everyone else who just did the exact same thing (or took EPO).&nbsp; There all doing it, There just comes a time when one of your teammates gets jealous, angry or paid enough to testify that he was doing it with you, and you won and he was relegated to carrying the drinks for the whole tour.<br /><br />BC<br /><br />P.S. Fuck Bradley Wiggins

				Also he never had testicular cancer, it was just an excuse to get it removed, as his balls were so oversized from taking the piss out of every other racer year after year, they were causing drag when draped either side of the seat, with 1 ball he cut a little hole in the front of the seat and kept it there during the race.<br /><br />

				I read his autobiography, which coincidentally you learn nothing of the man.&nbsp; Mainly his fight against cancers and finding his wife who is now ex or something I can&#039;t keep up with Lance......I guess I should get in line and try to avoid his flying testicles in the wind......
