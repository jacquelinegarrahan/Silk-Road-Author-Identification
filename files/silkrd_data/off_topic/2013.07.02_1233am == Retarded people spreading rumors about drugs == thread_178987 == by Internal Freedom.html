				Just thought I would mention this because it is starting to become more relevant with the new people Ive been chilling with.<br /><br />It dawned on me just how ignorant (need I say stupid) the drug-users in my area are. I&#039;m generally the kind of person who doesn&#039;t like to bash people based on their opinions and beliefs, but its starting to get rather annoying.<br /><br />Over the last little while, Ive been finding out why LSD and other drugs are not popular in my area. There have been a number of rumors spread around that are completely freaking people out. Ive heard the classic: Shrooms make your brain bleed, LSD kills brain cells and stays in your spinal fluid forever, and MDMA causes your brain to rot. Heck, I didn&#039;t start using psychedelics until I went online to disprove the brain bleeding from shrooms bullshit.<br /><br />Now, what annoys me even further is as soon as you tell them that they are wrong and to look it up and see the studies themselves, they ignore what you have to say and continue about their business. They don&#039;t look it up anyways and have no interest to. Even though they could see that these substances are mostly NOT harmful and are extremely enjoyable, they bash them anyways and refuse any other opinion that proves them wrong. Apparently weed is the only thing that&#039;s flawless and does absolutely nothing to you.<br /><br />Yet right off the bat I can list multiple cases in which weed is worse then LSD or mushrooms, more damaging too.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re all just really ignorant to information or what, but it makes it rather hard to discuss things like acid around people without having a group of people freak out and say how bad it is for you (these are the same people doing coke a few times a week).<br /><br />Instead, lets all just drink beer and smoke darts. That stuff is WAAAYYY better for you then that psychedelic&nbsp; crap.<br /><br />Anyways that&#039;s my rant for the day

				People may CLAIM that the reason they are against LSD is because it causes brain damage or something, but their real motive is fear of the unknown, which is ultimately the fear of annihilation of the self in the face of the Cosmos/Brahman/Tao/Consciousness/God, or whatever you want to call the divine mystery. The LSD/mushroom revelation is heresy in our materialist society.

				I love when people tell you how they used to trip balls in the military/jail/prison by having people crack their spine releasing some of the LSD stored in it. ::)<br /><br />It&#039;s like the guy who made LSD with oranges or the guy who made LSD with bread from the supermarket. ::)

				I can&#039;t believe how many times I&#039;ve heard people tell me about the amazing weed they or their friend grew with a black light.<br /><br />I remember someone telling me about the amazing cannabis plant they grew and decerated in Christmas lights and ornaments that High Times published.&nbsp; I asked him what type of lights he used and he said he didn&#039;t use any.&nbsp; Obviously I met God himself.&nbsp; By the way, God is white, about five foot six inches tall and almost 40 years old or this man I met was lying to me.

Either a friend knows some guy who lives in some dodgy neighborhood full of people sharpening their dog&#039;s teeth on park swings. Or you get them off some random in a club whose entire body is an event horizon for his giant pupils.<br /><br />But don’t worry, it won’t always be this way. Scientists are working on a solution. That solution is 3D printed drugs. Instead of having to go and get drugs from the scary outside world you’ll be able to print custom drugs adapted to whatever your needs are, right there at home, in your bedroom. Surrounded by empty takeaway containers and a cat that will be stoned forever because everyone knows that cats can&#039;t release THC.<br /><br />And you won’t buy drugs either, you’ll download apps. These apps will give you access to the blueprints that will give you what you need. And you won’t even need to worry about the legality of drugs any more, because there won’t be any drug laws, because drugs will be so tailored it’ll be impossible for the state to keep up without resorting to selling them itself.<br /><br />The current drug economy where wars are waged and billions exchanged illegally will be a thing of the past. With with 3D printed drugs, we could enter a brave new world where taking any drug is as legal as drinking a cup of coffee. But even more customized. Which is fine, as long as we don’t all end up addicted to something that makes us want to eat each other’s faces off, because the tandem effects make us feel like the sun.<br /><br />But mostly, 3D printed drugs will be about being able to give people the medicine they need, customized just for them, to combat diseases that are currently incurable. From a family that&#039;s predisposed to some horrible, life-crippling disease? Then you’ll be taking combative drugs from birth. Hayfever sufferer? Then why not take this bespoke drug synthesized from local honey, you pussy. Plus we&#039;ll be able to wave goodbye to the corrupt big drug companies that are in cahoots with chemists, because as long as they&#039;re regulated, anyone who has a breakthrough will be able to market the drugs directly to the consumer.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The brain bleeding on shrooms is still my all-time favorite. I remember my buddy telling me they made your brain bleed, so I started googling why that happens and how fucked your brain is after you take shrooms so I could warn my buddies.<br /><br />But... but then something WEIRD happened.<br /><br />I found out they DON&#039;T actually make your fucking brain bleed. After doing more research I discovered Erowid and well... it kinda went from there.<br /><br />Now at any given point I have 5-6 different psychedelics on hand along with a stash of MDMA and some stims.<br /><br />Ahahaha, what a great life :-)

				I have gotten into a disagreement with a &quot;friend&quot; who said that LSD was harmful to your body, and that DMT wasn&#039;t naturally produced in your body. A lot of people don&#039;t do the research into the science behind drugs and just use urban myths to deter them from trying them :( I am guilty of being under the illusion of these myths for a good portion of my life.

				I&#039;m actually 9, my mom helped me set up my SR account. She sends bitcoins to my SR coin address whenever she needs to get completely fucked up on Methadone, she lets me spend what ever money is left on psychedelic drugs which I then take at all-ages clubs with other sweaty prepubescent teens to have a good time. I&#039;m the head dealer of my school and I supply all the other grade 3 kids with various amounts of acid and coke. They like to go completely nuts during nap-time. <br /><br />Where did you think they spend their &quot;allowance&quot; money?
