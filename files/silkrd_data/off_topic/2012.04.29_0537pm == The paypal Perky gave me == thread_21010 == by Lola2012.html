				After trying to extort more coins out of Perky he decided to bail so here is his paypal.

				No, even if he&#039;s a giant troll, I never did any business with him so it&#039;s not personal for me.<br />But since I&#039;m in a good mood, anyone that wants it could just ask ;D<br />It was actually unbelievably easy to get lol

				Ya but I also wouldn&#039;t know if he could think ahead of time about that...<br />It&#039;s probably a 50/50.<br />And on another hand, it&#039;s not just a random identity he created because the facebook has 100s of friends and has been up for over 4 years plus it matches all of the other websites I used to crosscheck so it comes back to the email.<br />If the email is his, then this is his.<br />And if it is his, lol, I might have PMs for his address. haha

				So hold on, OP was cool with taking the hush money and allowing Perky to scam others but when he didn&#039;t pay then you&#039;re going to try and ruin his life. <br /><br />Fuck you. You&#039;re on the same level as he is if that&#039;s the case. Everyone needs to chill the fuck out and think before you act on here. Don&#039;t cast stones unless you are sinless.

Can&#039;t be done and it&#039;s pointless to try. <br /><br />Even if drugs were regulated, sold and taxed there would still be residual violence by addicts stealing for fixes or unstable people taking drugs and it making them violent. I admit that under this system there would be a lot LESS violence but there will always be violence associated with drugs. Just a harsh fact of life.

				I didn&#039;t mean to sound harsh man. I just take a pragmatic view at life. It&#039;s like there is always a bit of evil in every big corporation. Look at those guys who basically went to get contracts in the Iraq war. It was a free-for-all. So much black cash and dirty deals it was unreal.<br /><br />In a way the drug trade is more honest because it doesn&#039;t pretend there is that and there isn&#039;t really the protection of bullshit laws that serve those that have the biggest wallet and can buy the best solicitor. It&#039;s economic Darwinism at it&#039;s most ruthless.

In fact they should&#039;ve banned all financial transactions in the forum. I thought they hired a bunch of mods guess they were all undercover LE who are more interested in watching new customs get burned and circle jerking on the forum than take care of business.<br /><br />Perky was also actively blackmailing new vendors.

				I LOVE&nbsp; IT!!! THIS PERKY IS A TOTAL FUCKING LOSER. <br /><br />You know he is a huge piece of shit, when you can come on here and talk about scamming someone and you get + karma. :D<br /><br /><br />This loser tried to get me. He tried everything. I killed him.<br /><br />I have asked MANY of times why he is not banned. The response I got was:<br /><br />&quot; Why don&#039;t you like perky&quot;<br /><br /><br />I sent links from Senior vendors explaining&nbsp; how perky is scamming people. In fact I have not seen one and I mean one post where perky get props. Yet he is allowed to run lose here.<br /><br />It&#039;s crazy. This loser (perky) needs to get banned.Till then I hope he get&#039;s scammed 100x more.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />RxKing

I was going to post it regardless.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This guy uses terrible grammar and types in all caps. You can kill him now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Imagine messaging him back and forth for a few hours, It was fucking ridiculous. Like talking to a retartd. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The funny thing is, considering his terrible grammar is that he was actually advertising at one point that he had 2 degrees and was working on a PhD or some shit and would write papers for anyone interested. HAHAHA. Obviously it was a scam but still, if one of those papers ever were to get written I&#039;d actually pay a btc or 2 just to see how fucking horribly written it would have been. <br /><br />Ya&#039;ll leave this cat&#039;s life alone though. If any of you want to play a cruel joke you should send mail him some sort of official looking DEA letter or something of that nature just to fuck with him. Or send him a shitload of fake product, lol. <br /><br />Poor Perky. He started going off the deep end the last few weeks. That shit he did with RXKing was maniacal. Posting multiple threads every 30 minutes. I think dude was obviously an addict with no valid source of income and was just geeking his ass off the last few weeks.

				Well on the bright side of all of this, if this really is perky&#039;s information we can all take solace in the fact that he&#039;s probably out there shitting a brick right now. And if he has any semblance of a brain we won&#039;t be seeing any more of him for a while.

To be honest though, people like Perky are fuck ups in real life so I doubt he&#039;s worried about anything. He&#039;s probably used to fucking people over and doing dumb shit so I&#039;d like to say I&#039;m surprised by this, but I&#039;m not.
