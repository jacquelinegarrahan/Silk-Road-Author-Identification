				What a horrible day. Got shit for sleep last night, woke up several times with a raging boner and a crying bladder.<br /><br />Was supposed to get my bud today from brutusk. You&#039;d think it would come today, when it says it&#039;s supposed to come, considering it&#039;s priority mail. Nope. A big fuck you to the USPS.<br /><br />Next up, a customer txts me &quot;I dont want that test crap let me kno when u got some real stuff&quot;<br />ARE YOU FUCKING<br />GO FUCK YOURSELF<br />25i is not LSD, but it&#039;s not fucking poison either. At least I tell my customers what it is first.<br /><br />Horrible horrible horrible.<br /><br />How&#039;s everyone else doing today on this lovely morning?

				Jee, it&#039;s evening already here. The day was half bad (my mum on the phone), half-good (got myself to go for a run in the park and cleaned my place up).&nbsp;
