				Title says it all. Please let me know if I can PM you the exact link he sent to me, to you. I don&#039;t want to just post a download link. Too many idiots will end up downloading it.<br /><br />I believe it may be a rat disguised as a jpg file. Everything about the .zip is very very strange.

				A RAT in a .jpg file? That sounds unlikely. For it to work, there has to be a vulnerability in whatever software you use to display the image. If you&#039;re really unlucky, it will target the thumbnail-creation feature in Windows, because it is executed as you unpack the image. Or maybe it&#039;s a vulnerability in the way Windows handles zip files, and you got infected the second you completed the download, and Windows tried to figure out what was inside the zip! But honestly, if such a brilliant zero-day exploit exists, it would be a shame to waste it on you&nbsp; ::)

But no, that&#039;s not how it works. If the file-extension is .jpg, it will be treated as a jpg-image, even if it&#039;s really an .exe file. And besides, binary exe files wont execute in tails. It&#039;s a linux distro.

				So uh... unless Tails fucks with the kernel, Linux isn&#039;t gonna give a fuck what the file extension is.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t even look at it.&nbsp; Whatever funky launcher Tails uses might, but if it does, it breaks with Linux tradition.<br /><br />File&#039;s fine as far as I can tell man.&nbsp; Pretty nice looking picture too.&nbsp; I actually know exactly who sent you this now, since I recognize the work (but of course I can&#039;t say)&nbsp; :P

				... well now isn&#039;t that odd.&nbsp; Windows thinks there&#039;s four files in it.&nbsp; Unzipped it shows 3.&nbsp; With Vim, a programming editor, it shows... 4.&nbsp; Except, one of them is a blank line.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen that.&nbsp; Frankly I don&#039;t know wtf is up with that, but I don&#039;t see any virus or anything.&nbsp; Just looks like a fucked up Zip header -- I don&#039;t really know to be honest.
