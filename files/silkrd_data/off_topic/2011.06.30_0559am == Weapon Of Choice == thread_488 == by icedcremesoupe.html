				Just wondering what other people thought the best way to enjoy green on the go is? My personal pick is a Magic Flight box and my #2 is a Protopipe bowl. Anyone know of anything better/more discreet and convenient?

				The launch box is fantastic. It uses less bud than a bowl and gets me more baked than any other vaporizer. However for an experienced smoker it doesn&#039;t quite give the &quot;plunge&quot; ripping a bowl seems to have. But there is 0 smell which is a plus if you work in an office full of chumps. If you&#039;re gonna get one get extra batteries (Powerex 2700) and another NiHM charger because 1 battery is 1-2 &quot;trenches&quot; of power.I have 10 bateries and it&#039;s more than enough, 6 would be plenty. Also vaping seems to 86 the tired comedown smoking sometimes gives me. I&#039;ll be happy to answer any other qs someone has.

				Check out the Solo from arizer.&nbsp; It&#039;s a handheld that will have you blowing clouds.&nbsp; Not as stealthy as a LB but a great addition to your collection for sure.&nbsp; Puffitup.com has it on sale for $160 including a free grinder.&nbsp; &nbsp;Great deal from a decent online vape store.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://puffitupnews.blogspot.com/2012/05/bender-likes-arizer-solo.html<br /><br />

I prefer good ole&#039; combustion and still use my proto everyday over a year later. However I did get a wall adapter for the launch box that reall kicks it into gear. The batteries will die and not hold enough charge to release the kind of vape you want over time and it was painfully apparent when I got the wall adapter for the MFLB. So I have lost the portability of my MFLB (even new Powerex 2700&#039;s aren&#039;t as good as the wall unit). But have a solid friend in the Protopipe. <br /><br />&quot;A wise man remembers his friends at all times; a fool only when he needs them.&quot;

				Swisher blunts on the go... I do need a sturdy replacement however because blunts are less healthier and kill the weed taste.. i don&#039;t like the feel of joints and have to put a lot of weed in em to make em sturdy enough to fully enjoy.<br /><br />The vaporizor i tried.. the whispr is great, but i feel as if vaping the weed fail to provide a hollistic high, even though it do get me higher.<br />
