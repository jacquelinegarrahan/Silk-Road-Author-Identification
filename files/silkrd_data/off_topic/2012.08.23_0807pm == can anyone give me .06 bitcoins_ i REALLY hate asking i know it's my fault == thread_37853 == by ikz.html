				What&#039;s with all the beggars on the forum? They all sound the same - &quot;I really don&#039;t like asking but .. good karma for you ... I&#039;d really appreciate it ...&quot; <br />I&#039;d like to think that this community isn&#039;t really from the low end kind of junkie spectrum. I see junkies (and I&#039;m sorry but that language is the only way to differentiate from Joe average recreational user) on the street of my large north American city, and those are the only people I can think of when I read posts like this.<br />Is there some kind of way of filtering out beggars? Can mods ban profiles if they are reported begging?

I think im going to create a thread since SquidShepard said that all suggestions should go down there and I said that people email SR support since no one actually responds to us down there.<br /><br />....time for an experiment.

In honour of that, I&#039;ll spot you. How much do you need?

				I was hoping for a reply from the OP so I could troll them. The lack of which has honestly ruined my day.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Good call on the &quot;BTC Beggars Do Wat?&quot; thread, though there have been a few before and no Beggar&#039;s Corner has popped up yet. Only a matter of time I reckon!&nbsp; :)

				Im inherently not opposed totally to the begging. I just feel like it belongs in its place.<br /><br />Right now its as if I posted 15 &quot;HELP-PGP&quot; threads in the &quot;Products Offered&quot; section.<br /><br />...If I did do that, I&#039;d bet it would get moved.<br />
