				&quot;LSD is a drug that causes insanity in people who have not taken it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There is, of course, High Church and Low Church psychedelic. Ken Kesey&#039;s acid-test-rock-and-roll-on-the-floor-freak out is Low Church psychedelic, gutty, shouting, sawdust trail. Alan Watts is highest Anglican. Precise, ceremonial, serene, aesthetic, classic, aristocratic with a wink. The ancient rituals executed perfectly with a quiet twinkle in the eye.&quot; -- Timothy Leary

				“Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.” <br />― Terence McKenna

				All, Hunter S. Thompson quotes:<br /><br />&quot;Buy the ticket, take the ride.&quot;<br />&quot;I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they&#039;ve always worked for me.&quot;<br />&quot;The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.&quot;<br />&quot;You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye.&quot;<br />&quot;There is nothing more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge.&quot;<br /><br />There&#039;s a few. ;)<br /><br />
