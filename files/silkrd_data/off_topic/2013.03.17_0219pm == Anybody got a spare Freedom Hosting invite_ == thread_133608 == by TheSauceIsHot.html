				Keep in mind that if you give someone an invite and they abuse it (under undefined terms), they lose their account, as do you and everyone else you gave an invite to. We take a risk when we hand them out, so why should it be free?<br /><br />You can buy an FH code right now on SR for about $20. I&#039;ve seen them go for as high as $50, so there&#039;s no reason to hand them out for free. And if people have to pay for them, they are less likely to abuse them.<br />

I don&#039;t think it is right to sell the invites either, so I ask for donations (or if someone is building a private source board, I ask to be invited there) Nobody is middlemanning a free service. It used to be a free service until people started abusing it, so they implemented the invite system. IF you want to put up a site without getting invited to FH, then by all means, put up a site on your server. There are plenty of tutorials here and around the onion sites about how to host your own. My point in all of this was that you are approaching this with the wrong attitude. I hope you find what you&#039;re looking for (for free).<br /><br />stay safe<br />wretched
