				So I&#039;m sure there are a few movies/documentaries out there relating to drugs that we all like to watch.<br /><br />If you can list your favourites that would be great! I wouldn&#039;t mind checking some out that I might have missed or never seen before.<br /><br />My favourites are Blow, Scarface and Layer Cake

				Well, it&#039;s not about drugs exactly, but there is a good bit of drug usage in it.&nbsp; One of my all time faves, Lord of War.&nbsp;

				Movies about drugs, but not necessarily watching while on drugs?<br /><br />- Layer Cake<br />- Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas<br />- The Rum Diaries (little there but it&#039;s good)<br />- Dune (yeah, I know melange is a metaphor for oil but come on)<br />- Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (Snatch even more but no drugs even tangentially)<br />- Go <br /><br />I like both Trainspotting and Blow a lot but don&#039;t particularly enjoy re-watching them. I will not re-watch Requium For a Dream. Ever.<br />

				Requiem for a dream, Fear and loathing were really weird movies...<br /><br /><br />Are there any good movies, like Layer cake and Scarface where you can actually learn a few things from<br /><br />Ie: At the start of layer cake, the main character tells you strict rules that he runs his business by.<br /><br /><br />

				Oh, Super Troopers. Ha. Love it.<br /><br />This is going to be an odd one. More of an anecdote than a recommendation.<br /><br />I&#039;m on acid, and for some reason am watching Lost. (spoilers follow) And it happens to be the episode where Sayid has been captured and is being interrogated by the &quot;others&quot;. In the past, I think. Anyway, the lead interrogator, in true 60&#039;s hippie style, isn&#039;t going to torture Sayid. He gives him LSD. <br /><br />Interrogator and co. approach Sayid, bound, outside, and question him. Well, Sayid says all this crazy stuff. He&#039;s from the future, etc, etc.. Interrogator looks at the others and says &quot;I think I gave him too much.&quot;<br /><br />Sayid&#039;s already looking terribly amused, but now breaks into a huge grin, and I&#039;m grinning, too, watching this. &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;You used exactly the right amount!&quot; Which both Sayid and I find to be the funniest thing we&#039;ve ever considered. ROFL.

				It&#039;s too bad most movies with drugs try to show how bad they are. I particularly liked Drugstore Cowboy, it&#039;s a really good movie and is set in an interesting time period.
