				Because hey, let&#039;s be fair. We&#039;ve got a thread from someone biased against Limetless, so let&#039;s get a thread from someone biased for Limetless.<br /><br />Lack of bullshit not guaranteed. Other posters may ruin my intent.

				I don&#039;t understand all the hype about Limitless.&nbsp; Seriously, it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; He can be a monkey with 5 asses, for all I care.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t affect me in any sort of way.&nbsp;

				+1. All this bickering has to stop... This community has nothing to gain from it all. I personally don&#039;t think Limetless is bullshitting, why are people wasting their time on this matter? Isn&#039;t this what LE want? Stitching each other up and arguing with one another is weakening us.<br /><br />Let&#039;s not give the media more ideas for another article. I can see it now &#039;Silk Road users losing faith in their own community&#039;.

				This poor guy has had more threads with his name in subject line in the last few days (since he publicly announced he was going on vacay) then I have ever seen before when he is around all the time.<br /><br />I stand by my point in the other Lim thread (love him/hate him/ not give a shit) let him at least be around to defend himself. <br /><br />....This is the internet equivalent of talking behind somebody&#039;s back :\<br />
