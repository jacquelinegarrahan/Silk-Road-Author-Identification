				Hello to all the fine minds of the SR community. I shall cut to the chase. I am currently attempting a dissertation/thesis for university, and the aim of the study is: <br /><br />&quot;Are there better ways to measure and reduce the societal and health risks from alcohol and drug use?&quot; <br /><br />I need about 100 respondents to a very quick questionnaire. Apparently I need a different IP address for filling out the questionnaire, although I am currently using tor to bypass this and I&#039;m answering as many as I possibly can. But I need YOUR help. Yes, you. Who better to fill out a very quick 5 minute survey on how to reduce the risks from drug and alcohol usage?&nbsp; I basically have 2 days to gather enough responses to merit analysis in my dissertation. I need help.<br /><br />I need you to help me fill this thing out. You&#039;re already knowledgeable enough to answer this questionnaire by virtue of the fact you&#039;re accessing SR. And it very much appeals to your interests, vocations and you generally. Here is the link:<br /><br />https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5VSBGSG<br /><br />Any help at all would be greatly appreciated!

				I&#039;m hoping not to get flagged for spamming or anything, but I will probably return to this board periodically to shamelessly self-bump my post to the top of the forums. <br /><br />Also, if you do decide to fill this out, a big thanks first of all, but if you can be bothered, or if you don&#039;t have much to do, you could fill it out MORE THAN ONCE. <br /><br />Although any help at all will be appreciated. <br /><br />Thank you goodnight, much love.

				Filled one out for you, my friend. It wouldn&#039;t let me do it more than once, though. The link kept taking me back to the &quot;Thank you for taking this survey&quot; page. Anyway, good luck with your thesis.

				... So, you&#039;re trying to... fake your fucking dissertation research?&nbsp; ... okay then: may they rip your lies apart and toss you out without a degree when you defend it in front of committee.

I&#039;m tying to get as many respondents as possible through a variety of different means, not just the SR forums. But if I have to fake most of it, and I probably will have to, then I&#039;ll use educated guesses and generally make the research fit with my aims and objectives of the research study. You can try and pick apart what you deem to be immoral or whatever, but frankly I want my degree, along with the piece of paper that goes with it and the letters after my name. Half of the people I&#039;ve spoke to are also plain making shit up for their dissertation, and combined they don&#039;t have the computer literacy that I have. <br /><br />Defend my work in front of the committee? Ha, that&#039;s so not a problem. I know my shit.<br /><br />

Anyway, help would be appreciated. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, I don&#039;t know. <br />Why else would you be posting this here?<br /><br />When I data audit SurveyMonkey information... the first thing is to make sure that it&#039;s set for masked IPs, as per IRB guidelines/recommendations and no doubt your own human participants/ethics review... and then I look at the time stamps for responses (when started/when stopped).&nbsp; It&#039;s easy peasy to feed all that over and look at the curves. That&#039;s, like, auditor 101. <br />Timing is a good / sometimes great predictor of curbstoning. I can usually compare to known valid entries or similar-length surveys and break out very easily even with the limited information from SM. (Curves: they work.) <br /><br />At even a basic level, it&#039;s... ok, here&#039;s one example, and this is not the advanced stuff. <br />Arcane-topic link to a PDF file, use appropriate precautions or a viewer:<br />A System for Detecting Interviewer Falsification<br />Edited: links break, look it up by title<br />Table 1 looks like it couldn&#039;t possibly be that obvious, but, yeah, it is.<br /><br />I agree with Dictio. Also with SS, for whatever it is you&#039;re actually working on.<br /><br />Makes no sense that you would be at dissertation level and not have been exposed to the idea of detecting fraudulent data, that you&#039;d be collecting timestamped data in 48h, and that you said &quot;dissertation/thesis.&quot; They&#039;re different. <br />&quot;Wouldn&#039;t like to have to fake my research.&quot; You use such interesting tenses at times.<br /><br />Term paper wasn&#039;t a sexy enough explanation? Bored? Other explanations? No idea.<br /><br />Edited due to apathy on my part.
