				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---<br />To nigger , or not to nigger : that is the question:<br />Whether &#039;tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />The slings and arrows of outrageous niggers,<br />Or to take arms against a sea of niggers,<br />And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br />No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br />The heart-ache and the thousand natural niggers<br />That flesh is heir to, &#039;tis a consummation<br />Devoutly to be wish&#039;d. To die, to sleep;<br />To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there&#039;s the nigger ;<br />For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br />When we have shuffled off this mortal coil<br />Must give us pause: there&#039;s the respect<br />That makes calamity of so long life;<br />For who would bear the whips and scorns of niggers,<br />The nigger&#039;s wrong, the nigger man&#039;s contumely,<br />The pangs of despised niggers, the nigger&#039;s delay,<br />The insolence of niggers and the spurns<br />That patient merit of the unworthy niggers,<br />When he himself might his quietus make<br />With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br />To grunt and sweat under a weary nigger,<br />But that the dread of niggers after death,<br />The undiscover&#039;d country from whose bourn<br />No traveler returns, puzzles the nigger<br />And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br />Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />Thus conscience does make niggers of us all;<br />And thus the native hue of resolution<br />Is sicklied o&#039;er with the pale cast of thought,<br />And enterprises of great pith and moment<br />With this regard their currents turn awry,<br />And lose the name of action. - Soft you now!<br />The fair nigger! Nymph, in thy orisons<br />Be all my sins remember&#039;d.<br />

				&#039;It would be so much easier in life if all niggers were black and bitches females.&#039;<br /><br />Can&#039;t remember who said it but this is how I rationalise these &#039;hate terms&#039; <br /><br />words: If you are offended by them, go by a S&amp;W and use it on yourself.

				u cant just say something like that. theres always both in all of us. just because you think youre good or &quot;cool&quot; doesnt make you good. and maybe the &quot;asshole&quot; has a good reason for being this way. u dont have to grow old to realize that there are different sort people, little kids can tell. and saying there are just two sorts of people isnt very wise. sure i know what you mean but ive saw &quot;good&quot; and kind brothers hanging out on a positiv trip and next moment trying to kill each other (for real). never saw him since then again just a little talk, but whos the bad guy now? none of us could tell, we just went different ways and if you try to explain youre just a fool. <br /><br />same thing with this racist stuff. i grew up in a home for people seeking asylum as 3yo-11yo with blacks chinese iraqis dogs cats and rats. playing in the dirt all together as child makes you all the same. im white btw. never knew what racism is till i grew older. but dont think only whites can be racist, had enough examples of ppl other race who realy try hard gettin into victimhood and crying about being treated different. fuck we all have or had hard times, and fuck yea live fucking sucks sometimes..for all of us. is he better then a southern KKK idiot who never got taught better? there is no thing like black and white or one side of a medal and another. its such a sad and in the same amusing example that were only humans and the majority of us cant do better. we arent build to be perfect, were build to fail and not to last forever but thats a different story, noone can explain something that is wordless. but thats ok. nothing lasts forever but noone ever realy dies. and maybe when the time has come and we see each other again in a different way we can laugh about our imperfectness. <br /><br />dont try to be good or bad or black and white or whatever. there is no correct answer. just be yourself. do drugs and have fun till you die and love live the same time or be a bastard cop or a racist commoner. its your call, living life is easy<br /><br />sorry for long text but i hate race blabla<br /><br />Pinkman
