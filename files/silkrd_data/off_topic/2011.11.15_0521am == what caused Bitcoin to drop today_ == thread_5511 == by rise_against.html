				yes, watched it happen and made out like a bandit.<br /><br />there was a bid (buy) for $500,000 at 2.30 btc, and another a few hours later for $280,000 at the same price. someone with deep pockets talked everyone into selling.<br /><br />market fundamentals definitely apply to this currency.

				Even if walterjr made a mistake in his specifics regarding that bid/buy, his fundamentals are still dead on. Bitcoin is volatile, though hardly as much as it was just a few months ago. I&#039;m glad we&#039;re in this price range though, because the dips affect us a lot less than when the price was in the 20s. I only hope we find a bottom and then a general growth trend from then on. (Maybe this is the bottom?)

				Believe me, I know. I bought a lot at 5 that I just idiotically watched slip in value before my eyes. I kept thinking it&#039;d bounce back. But seeing it stay so relatively stable in comparison is also a positive sign for the future. It may mean that you have to wait a little before the coin you have now is worth what you bought it at, but at least we&#039;re not seeing the volatility of before, which may drive slow and steady growth as more people in underground markets see it as a volatile option (since it sure as hell isn&#039;t really being used for much else). I think what we saw before was a massive rise do to media publicity, then a quick fall as early BTC buyers sold at ridiculous gains and a bunch of SR users who signed up post-Gawker left (and yes, I signed up post-Gawker, but obviously I&#039;m still here and buying).

				UH, YEAH, when I first joined Silk Road they were 8 FUCKING DOLLARS a piece, and my dumb ass (not knowing ANYTHING about bitcoins whatsoever) bought $300 worth of them.

				I dont&#039; take it as a shot at all.<br /><br />But bitcoin turned into a speculation.&nbsp; All you have to do is look at a chart from inception and you see a pattern that has played itself out from all history.&nbsp; I can still see bitcoins being at 1:1 - and for the record, a BID at 2.50 would never get bitcoin to a 1:1 level, that&#039;s putting a massive floor on the price at 2.50USD/BTC.&nbsp; if you had an offer for 500k at 1.00 though, you can bet your ass BTC would be a dollar as fast as MtGox&#039;s servers could handle that much volume.

				well, in retrospect i should have been even clearer and definitely more eloquent. <br /><br />your view of it as being a unit of account is where it should be right now. it is tied to the dollar/eur/aud because that&#039;s still where we get our food from, shelter, etc from. until more people accept it as a form of payment for commercial enterprises it still will have that perception in general i think.<br /><br />i&#039;m hoping as more people offer services in bitcoin that people become attached emotionally to it in a positive way.<br /><br />and you are right about the 1:1 ratio, but with the negative emotion and the large drop people could have panicked and sent it down to that quite easily (in my opinion, i&#039;ll look for instances in money markets to see if one exists for whoever reads this thread). but eating an entire venue&#039;s ask is pretty insane. and then doing it again awhile later is ballsy. someone who knows what they are doing with resources to do it jumped in, if i&#039;m not mistaken they will have to wait quite awhile before they can short profitably.<br /><br />and someone is doing it again right now. bids at 2.20 and 2.10 that surpass the ask depth by quite a bit. not the same dollar amounts, about 20% of the last move like this.<br /><br />i can only fire in the dark at this point, anyone have a theory?<br /><br />anyone see the same move on eur/btc or aud/btc? haven&#039;t been watching those, and they are something like the 3rd and 4th largest volume wise.

				From what I&#039;ve been hearing there is a small closed exchange in invite-only beta right now, I think 500 or 1000 actual traders.&nbsp; It&#039;s designed by one of the guys from Citi and will offer things like an actual float with short-selling, put and call options if holders want to write them (I would probably use this myself) or buy them, etc.<br /><br />If that one takes off it will invite a flood of pros into the game and liquidity will flourish, leading to steady prices.

I&#039;d like to see BTC become a legitimate international currency too, but realistically, it is just a way to help add a little anonymity what we&#039;re doing. Buy low, sell high, sure. In fact, if you study the charts you can make a decent penny off the volatility of BTC, if you buy at 2.2, knowing in a few days it&#039;ll be 2.8 or something. But for those of us who buy BTC primarily to spend on SR, we&#039;re not trying to invest and the products we want aren&#039;t always available at the time we want them, so who knows what the value will be when we want to spend our coin? <br /><br />In terms of long term investing, the future of BTC is very uncertain. If what Anarcho says is happening ever gets fully realized, that&#039;d be great for the market. But we also have to think about the fact that BTC rose sharply in value immediately after a bunch of media publicity surrounding SR, then has been dropping ever since. For months, really. There is an obvious connection and we don&#039;t know where the bottom is. Furthermore, we don&#039;t even know the certainty of BTC&#039;s future, because it is a currency used primarily as a means of obtaining illegal substances, meaning it has a big fat target on its back.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t the same as the international currency exchange and it isn&#039;t the same as any stock market. If you think about it like that, you&#039;re going to get burned.
