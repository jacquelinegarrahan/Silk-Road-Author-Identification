				Do really exist lethal techniques that lead a person to die by hitting few spots bare hand or they&#039;re just film stuff ?

				I was in martial arts for 10+ years. My instructor trained with Bruce Lee and was a third dan red sash (past black belt). I learned many amazing techniques that could easily kill someone but only through brute force or actually breaking something. Never from some mysterious pressure point or a two finger jab kind of thing you see in movies etc.

				Actually this is very true.&nbsp; Not only the single lethal hit but also stuff something similar to the Kill Bill exploding heart punch.&nbsp; The art of pressure point strikes is called kyosho-jutsu, there is an excellent book on the subject by some asian martial artists who experimented on POW&#039;s to come up with the tricks.&nbsp; &quot;Anatomy of life and death&quot;.&nbsp; Tons of youtube videos.&nbsp; It is a combination of knowing where to hit and at what angle, as well as how to throw the punch.&nbsp; Punches can be thrown in two stages by experienced martial artists which snap the pressure into a single spot aimed at vital organs or nerve centers.&nbsp; Finger type punches are often used in these techniques and practitioners not only develop the muscles required but often hit boards so hard their finger forms micro-fractures which bond together strong than before.&nbsp; The multiple stage pressure point combos are very real.&nbsp; My favorite involves a kick to the side of the foot and then a light snap punch to the nerve in the jaw.&nbsp; You could do it with 2 fingers if you are good enough.&nbsp; Apparently the first pressure point can &quot;activate&quot; other points or just cause a cumulative effect on nerve overload with multiple hits. <br /><br />loscoy321: you ever train the one or three inch punch with your master?&nbsp; Id be interested in trading techniques.

				I found it quite interesting. do carry on.<br />A common move i&#039;ve seen is to Finger-jab the solar plexus and then Uppercut as they hunch over forward. followed by putting your foot behind their leg and pushing them over it, Stamp on head/neck or kick in bollocks depending on how they&#039;ve fallen..&nbsp; <br />Another martial arts expert told me that the collarbone can easily be shattered/snapped with a karate-chop style move, or using the base of the hand.<br /><br />Is this any good? lol.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really like harming others (I get quite upset over the fact that some of us still behave like animals despite alot of us having the realisation that we are higher beings.)<br />I&#039;ll always try to talk-down any possibly opponent before resorting to violence.<br /><br />Thanks for the reading material, I&#039;ll have to check it out. If you have any movies to study or specific youtube video&#039;s to search for, that&#039;d be great.<br />along with any other books.
