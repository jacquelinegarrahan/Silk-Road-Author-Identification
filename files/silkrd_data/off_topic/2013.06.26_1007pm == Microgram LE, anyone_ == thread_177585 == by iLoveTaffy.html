				I used to be an avid Microgram reader, but when they went dark, I was never able to find the Microgram LE edition. I usually consider myself as a person who can find anything; but I&#039;m unable to find this. It saddens me.<br /><br />Does anyone know where to find it? I&#039;m sure it&#039;s out there SOMEWHERE. We all want it, don&#039;t we? I woud&#039;ve posted this in &quot;product request&quot;, because I WOULD pay for it, but it SHOULD be free and given to all, so I posted here.<br /><br />Anyone? Thank you.

				Everyone does, but I want this bulletin. If you knew what it is you&#039;d want it too. Look it up. Check Erowid too, I believe they have a library of the previous Microgram before they split.

				It&#039;s a monthly bulletin published by the DEA. The Microgram and Microgram LE. The &quot;LE&quot; version is for a select group of law enforcement personnel. They used to release all of the information, but they went dark in 2009 I believe.

				Wait, are these the RECENT Microgram LEs? I think this is just the old library. Yeah, it&#039;s just the old library. I&#039;ve read all of them years and years ago, as they were released.<br /><br />The current publications are restricted and much harder to find. I&#039;ve only read maybe one or two publications.
