				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So obviously things have cooled down a bit in South Florida regarding the prevalence of pill mills writing for large amounts of 30s and 15s to out-of-staters. But let&#039;s say you are a non-Florida resident and were recently a regular patient at one of these mills, and suddenly your clinic closes?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you find another clinic that may be much less &quot;lax&quot; or &quot;crooked&quot; than the previous one, and let&#039;s say your MRI only shows evidence of minor disc bulges, will the 2nd clinic automatically write for something close to what you were getting before? Someone told me that if you show them a pharmacy record of what you were prescribed, most will generally write something equal or close to that even if your MRI doesn&#039;t show major problems.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, there are advertisements for MRIs in a popular magazine there for less than 200 bucks. Are these MRI places going to interpret your spinal images in a way that proves you are in pain (even if you aren&#039;t), or are they straight and by the book? This question is mainly for people who have experience with these types of SoFla clinics.
