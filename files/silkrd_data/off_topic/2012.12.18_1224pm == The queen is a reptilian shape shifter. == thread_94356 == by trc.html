				negative emotion and bad energy in people is viewed specifically in my high dose lsd trips as a person shifting back n forth between some weird reptile thing with scales and an emotionless human.&nbsp; i came to conclusion that lower brain peoples can be thought of as reptiles, and our psyche will interpret such archetype as the reptile -visually when tripping.&nbsp; by reptile, i mean very dinosaur like -but more like a digital apparition placed over and within the body.&nbsp; <br /><br />david icke got that information from shamans tripping on weird dmt concoctions and the like..&nbsp; i believe it as true, but not necessarily in a physical literal sense.&nbsp;

				David Ickel, hes a card. <br /><br />He believes in spreading the truth but charges for the information. Human race get off your knees, but quickly give me Â£19.99 so i can best tell you how to do this, nice guy but nothing more than an encyclopedia of truth salesman.

				Dont know much about David Icke, but sounds like a bit of a loon, dont really know whats happening in the video but i wish that dragon would jump up and bite her stoney, po-faced self righteous head off &gt;:(<br /><br />The only good thing about the jubilee was the extra holiday. Cant wait until next year, or some time soon, when she eventually dies and we might get another. Hopefully two ;D<br /><br />The royal family.....FUCK OFF!!!!<br /><br />IMHO :)

				To all who believe this stuff...<br /><br />Have you really researched this? Have you HONESTLY.. looked into the heart of this?<br /><br />Have you read countless books, done years of research? Are you REALLY looking for the truth? At all costs? Have you called up journalists? Called up libraries? Called up embassies? Called up publishers? Got a bibliography?

				There is no such thing as any of this shit, its like religion, its horseshit for vulnerable people who are obvious liabilities (you believe in a man in the sky). The only things that exist are things that are real, are ACTUALLY real, not fucking fantasy. Things such as Culture, Myths, Legends and Folklore taken literally by uncultured bastards who believe in such shite wouldn&#039;t understand. Revisionism annoys me, humanity deserves more gratitude<br /><br />Science, fact, evidence and biology are the only things that exist. <br /><br />Its fucking ridiculous to have a monarchy in existence with even minimum power in this day and age too, its embarrassing and im not even a &quot;minion&quot;. The English, Welsh and Scots deserve a Republic, as do we Irish! A peoples one!<br /><br />Look a reptillian thread turned political, shiiiaaazzzzzzoooooooo!

				All the reptilian theory is saying is that the royals are inbred (which is true) and their genetic make up is closer to an alien race that is controlling them. This is actually part of nazi philosophies (the royals are nazis) so again nothing shocking for me here. I acknowledge the alien part sounds a bit far fetched for someone not open enough to a lot of hidden realities of our world - but really all it says is some interaction with alien intelligence, which when you think of human history, there is a lot of that going on anyway e.g. pyramids, irrespective of reptilian royals. Again, to me, there is nothing shocking, and goes a long way of explaining why certain things are the way they are in our world (our reality is grossly manipulated away from its optimum state).&nbsp; &nbsp;
