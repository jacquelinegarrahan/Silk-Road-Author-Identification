				Title: <strong>Crack</strong><br />

				So, I&#039;ve recently started smoking a bit of crack. I&#039;m not sure why ;D<br /><br />Anyway, I like to experiment and fuck around with shit, so naturally, I want to try to make my own. <br /><br />I have never done it before, but am confident I can make a nice batch. However, having never done it before, I am not sure how to tell if I am getting it done right, or not.<br /><br />Suppose I had a gram of some of this fire coke that is obtainable here on the road.... About how much crack should I get from that?<br /><br />The estimated purity of the stuff on here is roughly 70%, I would estimate the purity of powder I can find locally is under %50, and probably %40.<br /><br />So if 1 gram of cocaine goes in, how much crack should I get out?<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Don&#039;t smoke crack..<br /><br />You will not get laid by any dyme piece if you smoke crack all the time.&nbsp; If you look around the forums, you will find a bicarb tek for converting to freebase.<br /><br /><br />Shit, once I started shooting coke, my pussy magnet meter went STRAIGHT to red (and not good red either), dog..&nbsp; But at least I was high as FUCK!<br /><br />

				You can enjoy coke AND have plenty of women, honestly. <br /><br />Regarding yeild. I don&#039;t remember exactly, but I think the difference in mass between pure Cocaine and pure Cocaine HCl is around 10%, assuming your coke is indeed HCl form (by far the most common) and your purity is 70%, you SHOULD obtain .63g of cocaine freebase, but remember that cocaine freebase is more potent by weight so you&#039;re not actually losing anything.<br /><br />There is a lot of bad noise out there about freebasing with baking soda, but if you know what you&#039;re doing you can obtain nearly pure product from the cook, the freebase floats to the top as an oil and slowly hardens. I knew a dealer who&#039;d cook his hard in the microwave in a 4C pyrex measuring cup, make big ol&#039; hockey pucks of crack.<br /><br />(update, MM of freebase is 303g/mol and the hydrochloride is 339g/mol so the difference is about 11% if my long unused math skills are still at all useful)<br /><br />If you&#039;re not afraid of needles, though, shooting coke is WAY more satisfying. As the user above mentioned, the intense WAH WAH, the crazy libido, the TASTE on your tongue and in your throat. I haven&#039;t had coke in years but I think I may have to order some soon :D

				Fair warning: You know when you&#039;re addicted to opiates, cocaine will sneak up on you. It&#039;s very easy at first, it does have the capability to become a demon-king faster than you realize. That said, have fun if it&#039;s what you want! I know I personally am absolutely unable to turn down a new drug.
