				Yeah conspiracy is a bitch. It&#039;s worse here in the UK, a friend of mine was driving back from the gym with another friend who had 12 grams of coke in his pocket. <br /><br />The police pulled him over on a random check as he was going over a bridge (they were pulling every 3rd car or so) and went through the usual, searched the car briefly, checked everything was working and waved him on. Then just as he was about to pull away they said &quot;Stop, we have a new test drug puppy we&#039;re training, do you mind if we use her on your car?&quot; he said yes, because he thought he had nothing to worry about. Little did he know the guy sat next to him had 12 grams of coke in his pocket.<br /><br />The dog found the coke pretty quickly, and both guys got arrested, my friend got charged with conspiracy to supply class A substances and remanded in prison with no bail to await trail. 8 months later the trail came, and I was watching from the gallery. The prosecution tried to claim that the MaxiMuscle workout drink which has creatine and vitamins in, which he used in the gym was a bulking agent for the cocaine, and he had two tubs of it (one strawberry, one chocolate) in the boot of his car, which came to about 2 kilo&#039;s. So the charge was increased from conspiracy to supply 12 grams of cocaine to conspiracy to supply over 2 kilo&#039;s of cocaine of 1% purity or whatever. <br /><br />Anyway in the end they got butt fucked by the jury of old grandma&#039;s and my friend isn&#039;t exactly the get away free type either, quite large and of African origins, plus 8 months in prison makes you look pretty rough, so they got found guilty and sentenced to 8 years each. (Joint enterprise, equal sentences).<br /><br />He&#039;s tried to have to conviction overturned but used up his appeal limit, and am waiting now for him to get out, he&#039;s got like another year left. (In the UK you only serve half your sentence).

Makes you wonder what they would&#039;ve got without the MaxiMuscle in the car. Its seems to be the law does anything it can just get someone busted for as long as possible.. i dont really see the positive in locking people away for time. Esp. for drugs.

				What the article didn&#039;t say was that her eyes (that did the witnessing) are serial killers. That&#039;s why she got done, because of her eyes...
