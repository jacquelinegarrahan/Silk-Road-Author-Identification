				***********************<br />ORIGINALLY SENT TO ROCKER<br />***********************<br /><br /><br />Hey Rocker, I have a short little story I&#039;d like to share with you and the SilkRoad Community.&nbsp; <br /><br />I received a cut of your &quot;Golden Teachers&quot; this morning- in record time I might add.&nbsp; After compiling more and more insecurities with a recent &quot;Vitamin L&quot; binge, I decided to try a more natural and compelling way of aiding with my depression.&nbsp; I usually get a bit nauseated with any form of Psilocybin, why I have yet to determine.&nbsp; So, upon opening the package I proceeded to pulverize the shrooms to a fine powder and carefully filled nine, five-hundred milligram capsules with the said powder.&nbsp; (Doing the math, I appreciate the extra gram and a half =)) The effects hit me within fifteen minutes and they have now just worn off. I had a trip that was quite unlike any other. This is where I begin my story.<br /><br />Three years ago, I was on my way to XXXXXXXXX at a private XXXXXXX with one of my dear friends. XXXXXX was a very inexperienced driver, and whilst trying to pass a SUV XXXXXXXX and lost control of the vehicle. What took merely five or ten seconds felt like an enernity to me. I managed to get the wheel from XXXXXXXX grasp amongst ear-curdling screams and inadvertedly steered the car over the median.&nbsp; This put us six feet into the air at seventy or eighty mph straight into a double-semi.<br /><br />When I came to, the entire car had been wrapped around my body.&nbsp; Luckly, I came out of it with a severed hand and my life.&nbsp; When I looked to my left I saw a half of a face.&nbsp; When I felt my lap and when I glanced there, there were large amounts of hair, bits of skull and grey matter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was in and out of the hospital for a day, and the following week my parents decided to get a divorce.&nbsp; <br /><br />To make a long drawn-out sob story short, I left for college in a daze. I started drinking heavily, doing heroin, meth, coke.. This lasted for a few years until I overdosed and was sent to rehab in XXXXXXXX. I just recently got back and have discovered the world of psychedelics.&nbsp; <br /><br />After a few attempts on my life, I have still been giving the thought some back-bone.&nbsp; Today was the day I decided I was going to end my life.&nbsp; I purchased the weapon and the ammunition through XXXXXXXXXXX, everything came through as planned.&nbsp; The only hiccup was receiving your package this morning.<br /><br />To be completely honest Rocker, I owe you my life.&nbsp; The trip I had today helped me revisit events from my past and helped me really re-evaluate priorities and finally my life.<br /><br />I sincerely owe you everything I have buddy. People like you are what make this world worth it. <br />Thank you Rocker, so much..&nbsp; and thank you SilkRoad.<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts,<br />you have done so much good in my life<br />I wonder how many others you have affected in the same way.<br /><br />Thank you all<br />I wish you all the very best of luck<br />together maybe we can put a dent in this ridiculous war on the personal use of recreational drugs.<br /><br /><br />************************<br />It is my wish to stay anonymous but it is also my wish to have this message heard by the community.&nbsp; Someone with the eye for &quot;redacted&quot; information, please look over this so I do not incriminate myself unnecessarily. There is a LOT of good that is being done and has been done by the Road and the people on it.<br /><br />People need to wake up and realize this.<br /><br />Peace and love everybody<br />I owe you all my life<br /><br />jtemp102311<br />************************

				my story with silkroads is not quite as traumatic but still basically the same. Suicidal until trying a psych from SR. hang in there, see a counselor and try taking 5-htp; it works wonders for my depression without the nasty side effects of regular anti-depressants

				It is indeed a nice story, but would you mind perhaps just replacing all the XXX&#039;s with fake names or whatnot? Its effect was lost on me after I heard mental &quot;beeep&quot;s while reading that paragraph with all that censorship. Heck,<br /><br />&quot;Three years ago, I was on my way to San Diego to a private club with one of my dear friends. Westley was a very inexperienced driver, and whilst trying to pass a SUV he lost control of the vehicle. What took merely five or ten seconds felt like an enernity to me. I managed to get the wheel from Westley&#039;s grasp amongst ear-curdling screams and inadvertedly steered the car over the median.&nbsp; This put us six feet into the air at seventy or eighty mph straight into a double-semi.<br /><br />When I came to, the entire car had been wrapped around my body.&nbsp; Luckly, I came out of it with a severed hand and my life.&nbsp; When I looked to my left I saw a half of a face.&nbsp; When I felt my lap and when I glanced there, there were large amounts of hair, bits of skull and grey matter. <br /><br />I was in and out of the hospital for a day, and the following week my parents decided to get a divorce. <br /><br />To make a long drawn-out sob story short, I left for college in a daze. I started drinking heavily, doing heroin, meth, coke.. This lasted for a few years until I overdosed and was sent to rehab in San Pedro. I just recently got back and have discovered the world of psychedelics. <br /><br />After a few attempts on my life, I have still been giving the thought some back-bone.&nbsp; Today was the day I decided I was going to end my life.&nbsp; I purchased the weapon and the ammunition through The Armory, everything came through as planned.&nbsp; The only hiccup was receiving your package this morning.&quot;
