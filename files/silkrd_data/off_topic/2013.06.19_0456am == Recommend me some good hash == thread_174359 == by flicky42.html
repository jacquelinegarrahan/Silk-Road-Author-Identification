				I&#039;m looking for a good stony indica that can help me sleep at night and ease my anxiety. I love sativas but that seems to be all I can get around here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about strain names at all so what venders here sell indica heavy hash? <br /><br />Thank you and +1 karma to all :D

				Middle Eastern and North African hash comes from indicas and Far Eastern and equatorial hash comes from sativas. For the most part at least, there are exceptions of course.

				A vendor in Spain named Emerald offers El Culero hash or butt hash as it is known. This is some of the best hash around, search butt hash or el culero on youtube and Jorge Cervantes gives a detailed explanation and a smoke. Here is the link the vendor page. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c1be9f2c59 He also offers many other good quality hash&#039;s.

				I also really like emeralds listing since his price is nice for 5 gs. I&#039;m an American so I&#039;m always iffy about ordering overseas but we&#039;ll see how this goes.<br /><br />Thank you everyone. I just don&#039;t want to be taking my Valium anymore I&#039;d&nbsp; rather use weed to help me sleep.

				Hello,<br /><br />Thank-you for the mention guys! (how the hell do you give karma?)...I know we are a bit absent from the forums sometimes...but living the life in the 3rd world darknet is paradoxical&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Have a look at our listings and profile (in signature) decide if you like the sound of what we made and maybe you could find the best hash you have tried :P<br /><br />if not we are going to have an ol&#039; fashioned hash off...bring funky pipes and your best stash....:)<br /><br />Safe,<br />NaturalOils
