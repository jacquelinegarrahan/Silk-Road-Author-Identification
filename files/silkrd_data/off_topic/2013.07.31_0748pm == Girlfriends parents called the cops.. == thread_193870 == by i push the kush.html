				So my gf is pregnant, her brother and her got into an argument earlier and they were shoving each other then he started punching her in the stomach. And he was screaming at her saying I&#039;m a piece of shit boyfriend and that he doesn&#039;t love her. Their parents just called the cops, I told my gf to press charges on the little faggot but chances are she wont. The problem I have with this is that he knows I sell MDMA, he could tell the police that. I&#039;m not really worried about that though cuz the police just don&#039;t look into thing because of word of mouth and if they were to come to my house I would tell them to fuck off and get a warrant and clean house lol Let me mind you I was not there when this occurred because I would beat his skinny faggot ass.

				After reading this a few times, I am still not sure what you are getting at.<br /><br />Is this just something you wanted to get off your chest?&nbsp; Are you seeking advice?<br /><br />Either way, I know you wanna knock this kids lights out and you love your girl, etc..&nbsp; But in my experience, it is best to stay well away from GF&#039;s family drama.&nbsp; Especially if you are selling schedule 1 substances.<br /><br />It&#039;s tough, and I know you are madder than hell..&nbsp; But a cool head always prevails.&nbsp; Let his &quot;skinny faggot ass&quot; be the one who faces the cops.&nbsp; If they were called to respond to a domestic,&nbsp; you can bet they are gonna focus their attention on making him feel like slime, as opposed to going way off topic and asking who&#039;s got what in town.<br /><br />If you are really THAT worried about it, then pack up your rocks and get them and any other dirt you have off of you fast.&nbsp; What good are you to your child if you are locked up in jail with a bunch of other dudes?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I dunno, I&#039;m just typing.&nbsp;
