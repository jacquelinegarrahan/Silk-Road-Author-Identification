				So, I have a good amount of experience with psych&#039;s. I&#039;ve taken about 60+ trips so far on roughly 18 substances, including some wild combinations.<br />I have the least experience with shrooms, however. Among my friends I tend to the intrepid psychonaut, priding myself on managing to sustain my coherence long into a <br />trip. At the same time, I thrive on pushing my psyche to the extreme limits. I LOVE a good nighttime solo trip in the forest (much more intense).<br />I&#039;ve had ridiculous OBE&#039;s on heavy DOC doses, glorious visions and NDE&#039;s on DMT, but nothing<br />could prepare me for this experience. Even the two previous fungus trips I took were subsequently weak in comparison. <br /><br />10:10 PM: <br />I prepared 3 grams according to the lemon tek. I chopped them up into about 1-2 cm squares and soaked them in a quarter cup of ReaLemon lemon juice<br />for about 30 minutes. <br />10:45 PM: <br />I then poured a cup of apple juice into the cup of shrooms/lemon juice and mixed. Getting the shit down was the most challenging part<br />of the whole night, and I normally love mushrooms. I guess it was nerves (my girlfriend tripped the week before me, had 3 pseudo-NDE&#039;s, left me a bit freaked).<br />After consuming the shrooms, I decided to sit and watch some TV. I am a major advocate for outdoor tripping and ANYTHING other than the boob tube during<br />a psychedelic experience, but with all I&#039;d heard (the potential for dark thoughts to take over, etc) I felt I needed some kind of external influence to keep<br />my mind in a happy place. So I decided to stay safe in bed watching the tube.<br />11:15 PM: <br />The girlfriend is watching Kitchen Nightmares.I was definitely starting feel it as Gordon Ramsey sounded like he wanted to murder me and fist my dead asshole<br />with the hammer of Thor in every word he shouted. Fucking terrifying. Quickly changed it to Adventure Time.<br />11:35 PM: <br />I have never given two shits about this show before. I&#039;m 25, don&#039;t really have time for cartoons. But sweet baby Jesus, I was enthralled! That&#039;s around the time<br />those blue meanies began to lift me into the clouds with a mental orgasm. The next hour was filled with waves of sensation. From the top of my head to the tip of my toes<br />there was a ridiculously heavy feeling of euphoria. I&#039;ve had a ton of experience with 4-Aco-Dmt, and I think that&#039;s my best comparison (well, der, it&#039;s psilocetin). <br />I remember thinking, &quot;FUCK, this is what it feels like to ascend into heaven! THIS IS HEAVEN AND I&#039;M A GOD! I want everyone I love to feel this all the time!&quot;.<br />The headspace was cloudy, but positive. I was pretty spaced out and in love with everything. Adventure Time was a great decision. Most of the time I would zone into the<br />&nbsp;show, laughing my ass off and becoming emotionally attached to the main characters.<br />12:45 AM:<br />The euphoria was still strong, but my headspace was different. I was still watching AT, but not as closely. The visuals were wavy borders and displaced colors (mostly <br />tri-colored halos around everything). CEV&#039;s were decent. Paired with the body high, I would visualize soaring through these crazy worm holes of brilliant color and shape.<br />1:00 AM:<br />I began pondering. I&#039;m a very philosophical thinker, contemplating existential thoughts all the time, but the thoughts went even deeper<br />than normal. DICHOTOMY was the word for the night. Harmonious duality. I would think in one way, then follow that thought up with a sort of rebuttal defending<br />an opposite point of view and how one could not be without the other. I continually thought how complicated AND how simple life is. <br />How love is the only way, but we must also be realistic. How we cannot have all good or all bad. It goes on and on, but the way of thinking was so very interesting<br />to me. <br />1:30 AM<br />Things start to get fuzzy around this time. I got up to pee and felt dizzy in a drunk sort of way. My depth perception was way off. I felt like the walls and the floor <br />made out of the reflections from a circus mirror. I looked in the mirror and was a bit startled. My face would change from demon-esque to elderly and elongated. When I <br />relaxed my focus, I saw the typical stretching out of my face and facial features sort of floating about, changing in size. My last shroom trip, I observed my face split<br />in half down the middle and form into two heads. There was a significant amount of &#039;reflective symmetry&#039; as I call it, where everything looks like a perfect reflection<br />of its other half. Not as much this time.<br />~2:00 AM<br />My mental space began a decent into a darker place. I became overwhelmed with maliciousness toward all living things. I was still watching AT muttering, &quot;Kill him. Kill him.&quot;<br />at the TV. I imagined murdering people I knew and people in general to satisfy a sadistic passion. That, fortunately lasted a mere 5-10 minutes. The euphoria and body high<br />had been coming in waves for some time, but I didn&#039;t feel bad at all. <br />~2:15 AM<br />I remember feeling a bit anxious, hoping I wasn&#039;t already coming down. I wanted more, but I promised myself I&#039;d be satisfied with whatever experience the mushrooms<br />&nbsp;gifted me with. I wanted things to get wild. I wanted something totally foreign. In the next couple of minutes, my wish came true. The dichotomy turned from thought<br />to emotion. I was in heaven and hell mentally. I couldn&#039;t remember how to speak. The voices from the TV were shouting at me in alien languages and I couldn&#039;t mutter<br />anything but the word &quot;Fuck&quot; over and over. My body began to move on it&#039;s own. My breathing was being controlled by my emotional state, slow and almost nonexistent to<br />sudden bursts of panic-induced inhales and exhales.&nbsp; I was racing around in my mind. <br />I curled up into the fetal position and rocked back and forth, not sure what I was saying. I was terrified, but I wasn&#039;t. It got even weirder when I started laughing <br />like a mad man, then crying my eyes out. I sat up involuntarily, murmuring things that made no sense. I remember flopping over and pushing my face into the bed at my <br />most insane moment, laugh and crying simultaneously (never understood how someone could do that) and breathing at frighteningly inconsistent paces. My brain was getting<br />raped, essentially. I was still laugh-crying and held onto my girlfriend&#039;s waist at this point. She was barely awake, heavy sleeper. Everything started to crash down <br />on me. I cried over the mistakes I&#039;d made, the people I&#039;d hurt. I have a fairly serious illness that is under control, but I began thinking that this was it. I was going<br />to die and I needed to face it. I was going to have to leave my family. Everyone I loved was at the forefront of my consciousness. I felt regret for the time I felt<br />was wasted with all those people. I missed my parents and wanted to tell them how much I loved them. Memories came flooding in. Things I hadn&#039;t thought about in over a <br />decade, lucid nostalgic experiences, manifested.<br />2:45 AM:<br />The fearfulness passed. My brain grasped to some shred of sanity finally and I was able to speak to my girlfriend. I explained how unreal my experience was. I felt like I knew what it was<br />like to be schizophrenic. How different everything was. It honestly was not bad, or good because those words didn&#039;t exist in that world. It was<br />just different and she agreed and discussed her experience with me. I remember everything being so &quot;real&quot;. As in, this life&#039;s no joke, and there&#039;s no time to fuck <br />around. I felt adamant about never tripping again, and very serious about taking better care of myself. <br />We came to the conclusion that it was nearly impossible to describe that mind-state, much like that of a schizophrenic. It was just... different! it&#039;s another reality, <br />a completely foreign state of mind and being that the lexicon of a sane person does not apply to. The fine line between dimensions, between sanity and insanity is<br />so slight! Very comparable to my feelings regarding DMT and dimensional reality.<br />3:15 AM:<br />I went to the bathroom again. The visuals were lessened but still there. I was calm and my mind was blazing with philisophical rumination. I played a bit of guitar but <br />was too interested in talking about everything at that point to continue for very long. I sat in bed with my girlfriend and talked about the world and how we felt that<br />people need to be given the knowledge provided by natural psychedelics like mushrooms before going out into the world. Education is important, but what psilocybin<br />can teach us is crucial to human evolution. <br />I went to bed shortly thereafter. The next day, the experience was still with me and it remains fresh in my mind a week later. Phenomenal. I feel great respect for the<br />mushroom. I have used psych&#039;s like weed in the past, tripping multiple times a week, but I feel I will only use shrooms when needed or at least in a more <br />ritualistic manner.<br />I never thought I&#039;d say this, but I think everyone could benefit from having a sitter for a shroom experience. Depending on how strong your experience, of course.<br />Have fun and stay safe. Though I was made more aware how I shouldn&#039;t take life for granted, I also learned the importance of balance and of the quality of our <br />experiences in life.

				Awesome trip report man!<br /><br />As for shrooms being hard to get down, I hate the taste, but I have the answer.&nbsp; ;)<br />(not that it&#039;s a secret lol)<br /><br />I will never eat shrooms again, unless I don&#039;t have access to a stove or whatever.<br /><br />Anyways, I chop them up and soak them in lemon juice as you did, but then I put them in a pot of simmering water for about 20 minutes. You must make sure the water stays to a low simmer because if it gets too hot you risk damaging the potency of the shrooms. After that 20 minutes I add my tea bags. I am a country boy so I love sweet tea, so I just do some lipton tea bags. Put cover back on and let simmer for another 10-15 minutes. Then I strain out the tea and squeeze all the mushies to get the magic outta them. Some people eat them after that, but I usually just toss them. When I drink the tea I&#039;m usually full blown tripping within a solid 45 minutes. And I have never gotten nauseous drinking tea, so I definitely prefer it.<br /><br />Just my two cents!

Then I strain out the tea and squeeze all the mushies to get the magic outta them. Some people eat them after that, but I usually just toss them. When I drink the tea I&#039;m usually full blown tripping within a solid 45 minutes. And I have never gotten nauseous drinking tea, so I definitely prefer it.<br /><br />Just my two cents!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thanks! <br />That&#039;s a great idea for next time. I&#039;ll definitely give it a try.<br />Fortunately, the nausea only lasted an hour, tops.
