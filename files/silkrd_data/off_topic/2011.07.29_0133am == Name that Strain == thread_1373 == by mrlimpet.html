				I just got a gram of dank from a friend a couple days ago, he usually knows the name of the strain but the stuff he got me, he had no name for it so if I can describe it hopefully someone can tell me what kind they think it is.<br />1. it has a citrus taste when smoked<br />2. the high creeps up on you about 10 mins after you smoke it<br />3. it gives you an incredible couch-lock, i have never felt that lazy before<br />4. it gives you an extreme case of the munchies<br /><br />Hopefully someone can help with the name of this delectable strain for me

				well 2 things<br />1) i would venture as to say 90% of the strain names your friend is telling is not the legit name of the bud, lots of people just tack a name on a bud to make it sell faster and you are not getting the true true strain being represented.&nbsp; &nbsp;This maybe different where you live but in my part of the country this is common practice.<br />2) You really havent given any viable clues for people to use to identify your buds except that it is citrus and it gave you couch lock.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A)&nbsp; Couch lock indicates - indica<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B) Citrus could indicate several different strains<br />Was your bud green, bright green,&nbsp; covered in hairs, were the nuggets dense, if you provide some more details you might get some guesses from a few weed gurus here but i doubt anyone can nail down a name for you.<br /><br />Sorry if i sound like an ass i am really high and was interested in your thread but racked my brain to hard and it gave me a headache

				Exactly, it would be impossible to tell what the strain is no matter how many details about his bud he gives us. Even if you provided pictures it could only be narrowed down to several strains, it would be near impossible to tell for sure unless it was a really unique strain.

				I understand how it might be difficult to narrow it down to an exact name, and I have a friend who deals who gives his own names to it, and the guy I got this from is probably one of the dumbest dealers I have ever bought from. <br /><br />The bud was a light/pale green. It is really dense and fluffy, with little to no hairs
