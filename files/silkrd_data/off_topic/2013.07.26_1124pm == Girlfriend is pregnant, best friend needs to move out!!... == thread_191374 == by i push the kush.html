				So, I&#039;m 21 and so if my gf. She just found out she is pregnant about 1 month ago. But she will not move in with me because she hates my best friend who lives with me and she hates his whore girlfriend. They always come home late at night drunk and being loud, and that&#039;s just no place for a child. He has been my best friend since 7th grade, I don&#039;t want to kick him out cuz his house where he lived before actually got burnt down... Arson. But he is going to have to go, he has a lot of money so I shouldn&#039;t feel too bad. I&#039;m just trying to think of a way to tell him without being so blunt and dickhead like haha what do you guys think? I don&#039;t want to ruin a friendship, but I&#039;m growing up and some shit is going to have to change. Any feedback is appreciated.<br /><br />Regards,<br />i push the kush

				Your child should take priority, that&#039;s your blood.<br />Just be honest with him.&nbsp; Your life will be changing drastically, but it looks like you know what you have to do already.<br /><br />Best of luck.

				If you haven&#039;t started talking about this to him yet, then you should.. stat.<br /><br />People are alot more receptive to things when they aren&#039;t blind sided.&nbsp; Besides, if him and his girl are gonna be partying..&nbsp; They aren&#039;t gonna wanna live with a kid, so if you start the talks now then it should be smooth.

				Also bring up your girlfriend being pregnant FIRST and frame it as you needing to make a change in your life (living with her, not your best friend).&nbsp; This is a positive way of raising the issue, rather than admitting that it&#039;s largely motivated by your girlfriend not wanting to live with him.<br />Good luck!
