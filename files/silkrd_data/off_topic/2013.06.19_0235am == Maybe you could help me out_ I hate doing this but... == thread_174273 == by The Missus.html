				Okay, so before I explain myself I already asked in the spare coins thread but didn&#039;t seem to get a reply.<br /><br />I am asking for a 0.34 btc loan. I want to make an order for some MDMA today because my anniversary is this saturday. I want to show my bubba a great time but I don&#039;t get payed until this thursday/friday. If anyone can lend me the 0.34 btc I&#039;ll be able to repay 0.35 - 0.37 btc back on thursday or friday. I&#039;m still a bit fresh to SR, I&#039;ve been here for almost a month now I believe and I have two completed transactions under my belt with no issues. I&#039;m not trying to fuck anyone over or anything, I have a regular job and crap, put me on a shit list if I do, but I just need a little bit of help&nbsp; :)<br />So if you can help me out any that would be dazzling. Even pointing me in the direction of a MDMA vendor who&#039;ll give me a loan will be great.<br />My SR username is the same as my name on the forum.<br /><br />The Missus<br />My address-19XzibvG8RpvVQqDZogq6JCDuwWLCBoK5e<br /><br />I don&#039;t like to beg, but I really want to make my man happy.<br />If anyone does consider giving me a loan, please tell me first. Thanks.<br />
