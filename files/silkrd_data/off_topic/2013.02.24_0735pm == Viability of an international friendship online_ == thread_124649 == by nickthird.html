				I find that whatever it is that allows me to connect with certain perfect strangers, seems to be causing the opposite effect in my online &#039;life&#039;.<br /><br />The problems of finding someone online for me are:<br />(1) The people I connect with by vast majority, are not online (as I would be if I had more of them).<br />(2) Death of chemistry, nothing to say and the person I&#039;m talking with lacks the motivation.<br /><br />The cause of this I have analyzed to be:<br />(1) Lack of non-verbal response, for both sides. This causes lack of motivation.<br />(2) Lack of non-verbal context. I actually can&#039;t figure out what the other person has in mind.<br /><br />The worst part is the latter, as I don&#039;t process norms as do most humans, I rely on context. This is really helpful when it comes to understanding a diverse range<br />of people, but the very same process breaks completely when text is introduced: I need to ask a lot of questions to get very basic things across and<br />this being a feedback-less state, the part of me that is in-charge of feeling my impression on the person becomes confused and generally breaks down.<br /><br />Opinions anyone?

				I wish it was that simple!<br /><br />I actually score very highly on facial emotion recognition tests.<br />I don&#039;t think my interests are narrow and repetitive, but that&#039;s not exactly objective.<br /><br />But yeah sure something in the autism spectrum, no doubt.
