				Why? Because counterfeits. Also, that shit is WAY over-priced. So there is always the chance of buying fakes, plus the fun of being ripped off even if you don&#039;t. It&#039;s adding insult to injury when you do end up getting a pack of fakes, though.<br /><br />I have nothing else to say on this matter.

				Hasn&#039;t happened to me, but it just occurred to me how pathetically easy it would be, and how likely it will be a scam in the future. The black market is amoral and that attracts the immoral, sadly. I&#039;m glad you haven&#039;t gotten shafted yet, Oh Captain My Captain, and I&#039;m especially glad you take precautions. :)<br /><br />Mostly what made me realize is seeing someone listing fresh crisp $20&#039;s for $27. That&#039;s when I realized that someone with a vendor account could offer cash-in-mail for bitcoins and send out fakes. If they keep the fake-count low, they&#039;ve already made a profit with the overpriced cash and they make an extra one with the &quot;cut&quot;. Or they could send all fakes, and if it is small amounts from small users just wanting a bit of cash, they may not even know and end up walking around with $100 in counterfeits.<br /><br />So the point is; Don&#039;t do it or know what to look for if you do because you don&#039;t want to be the unlucky person caught holding a fuckton of fake-cash, and it is even worse to be that unlucky guy when you paid real-money prices for it.<br /><br />Thanks for the concern though, folks. :)

So yeah, it is the reason I made this thread. It&#039;s over-priced and for some reason I find it sketchy, as well.<br /><br />But really, the thread makes sense even without a listing like that giving me a reason to make it. In the amoral marketplace, you really have to be careful. Either know how to spot counterfeits or don&#039;t buy cash on here. :)<br /><br />Probably don&#039;t sell it, either. I just realized what the buyer-side scam would be...
