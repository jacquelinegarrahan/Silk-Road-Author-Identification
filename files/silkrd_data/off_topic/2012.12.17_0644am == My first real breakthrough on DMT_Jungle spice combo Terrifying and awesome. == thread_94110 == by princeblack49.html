				40 mg NN DMT from TreeOfLiberty<br />12 mg Jungle DMT from ELVIS<br />30 min after a mild dose of Lemon Haze cannabis from Cali4niaLove<br /><br />I vaporized the mixture in a small &quot;elf Machine&quot; i made from 2 different pipes sold at the BP ( a large chillum connected to a glass bong stem housing stainless steel chore for convection and a smaller piece of chore wrapped in a screen for a heating element placed on top of the DMT for the first melt before vaping to keep the flame off the DMT.<br /><br />I did a slow draw with the elemet intact, melting the DMT mix and removing the element I did&nbsp; 3 long slow draws As soon as I was barely able to set the pipe down&nbsp; at the 3rd and final exhale. I launched into a technicolor world within my own and immediately was surrounded by beings who looked a lot like the &quot;Nutcracker doll&quot; they were signalling with neon green + or a neon red x whenever i turned my head in the direction it wanted to go or did not want to go. I did not want to move and the expressions on the faces of the beings seemed angry. As I turned my head to the hall their expression went from red to green and smiling and flashing yellow arrows pointing me down the hall appeared with big green + signs. I refused to move and close my eyes and my tongue began to swell, cutting off my air as the beings went red again. I rolled my office chair toward the hall and my tongue was replaced by a normal tongue and green arrows appeared to point the way. <br /><br />This cycle continued with every refusal and acceptance I put forth. Fearing for my life I was directed the the living room. I got to the couch and pleaded in my thoughts to them to let me stay put for my own safety. They saw the baby stroller in the room and &quot;A baby, that&#039;s nice&quot; was the response. A sense of relief came over me but I still was fearful that they may change their minds. The psychic grip on my tongue loosened. I also had a sense that these beings were guardians of a place between worlds and they were as curious to see my world through my eyes as I was to enter theirs. A sense of benevolence mixed with mischief. I was so glad to land back in reality unharmed. <br /><br />This experience gave me a profound sense that I need to be very respectful of this drug and the spirit plane it can allow you to enter. I have heard that Jungle spice can be darker. Several light doses had been done two weeks prior with mild but interesting effects before I&nbsp; perfected my smoking device.&nbsp; I wonder how much this had an influence on where I went with this trip. :P :-X 8)

				met my spirit guide tonite.<br />35 mg of rogerpete&#039;s DMT vaporized perhaps too quickly in the &quot;Machine&quot;, fresh glass fresh chore.<br /><br />as the second hit set in i put the pipe down, slight nausea wave space breaking into fractals. The normal &quot;click you are in did not happen as I drew the last hit too sharply and I think pulled some DMT through. But as I settled back and closed my eyes the same old attention getting scheme from an entity was making my tongue swells if it were saying &quot;not you again, open your eyes so I can see&quot; I spoke in my thoughts &quot;please let just take a journey, there is nothing much more to see in my world that you haven&#039;t already seen&quot; The point of exit was ready and harsh and remembered I had set an intention to release my thoughts and meditate. I took a breath and let go of my thoughts and expectations The &quot;click you&#039;re in&quot; happened and I was catapulted into some amazing scenes changing to fast to describe. every now and then there would be a baby that would appear and coo when my guide showed me something and I got it. It was a very loving and gentle experience and I am beginning to recognize the way my guide speaks to me through my own body signals. On my way out I realized the presence was my spirit guide and I remember saying thank you over and over for revealing its worlds and it felt like the guide was receptive and would be happy to see me again soon. Very freaking cool.<br /><br />40 min later another 40mg slowly and correctly vapid. nausea fractals, closed eyes and met the entity again and had a similar movement through space, but the guide and others had a god laugh that i had to pee. I felt apologetic. They presented funny click through images of a CGI toilet that seemed to be alive beckoning me to go ahead and find the toilet. Opening y eyes I decide to get up slowly, movement is strange and every object i see seems inhabited by a soul, cartoony presence. lasting way after the visuals were gone. they seem to say goodbye as I wave at y furniture...

				Absolutely fascinating!<br /><br />Something I&#039;ve always wanted to do but too frightened.<br />The closest I&#039;ve got was sniffing Yopo(Cebil?) flat DMT-containing seeds along with lime. It was very uncomfortable and made me feel hot and itchy with a swelling head.<br />Nothing really happened apart from a mild alien-like prescence, could have been placebo it was that mild.<br /><br />Would you ever try an oral dose with MAO-A or B inhibitors? seems to be the easiest way to go but can be a bit long lasting if you&#039;re having a bad time.

				nice. i have never seen the entities playing with me as vivid as you place it on a dmt trip.&nbsp; &nbsp; my first breakthrough was rather scary and very audio hallucinatory -then weird, i think i thought i killed myself haha.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m going to start playing with changa more, combined with the b capi maoi extract.&nbsp; i have plenty of dmt to explore with, so at the moment.. i&#039;m just exploring the various routes on how to use this tool.<br /><br />it seems to me the entities i meet are formations of my thoughts.. which to me is the same as my spirits and demons.&nbsp; i can go into trances most specifically on mushrooms, but stronger(but shorter) on dmt, and apply work within the spiritual realm. ask the entities questions, and watch the answers.&nbsp; no better way to visit church.

				So I wrote a new report on the latest experience. I have made peace with the entity that I was having troubles with in my first report.<br /><br />About 50mg of Roger Pete&#039;s DMT was placed into the pipe. Late. The house is asleep and chores are done. Good feeling about the day.<br /><br />The first round hit fairly heavy after 3 draws. I set the pipe down before I feared I would be unable. The room changed shape and I leaned back and closed my eyes.&nbsp; The presence there seemed fearful of me as if they wanted to be sure I was not the law, I had this same experience the night before. I found humor in this and I felt like I needed to affirm my peaceful intentions. I began to think about God and wondered if my being here was OK. I felt that feeling as if I were hiding from my parents and wanted to reconcile that. Small prayer for compassion and understanding from God.<br />The trip faded with these thoughts. meditated, heard music inside my nervous system and decided as it faded I would get a drink of water after sitting for a few more minutes.<br /><br />I examined my pipe and noticed there was still quite a bit left hanging in the chore and so I sat down and took a deep draw which hit pretty quickly but in a way I had never experienced. Everything was covered in these thin electrical currents. My hands my body the walls, the baby swing seemed charged with electricity. Much less erratic but with all objects taking on a life-form of sorts. I decided to close my eyes and at first all I saw was just a field of blue with a finely patterned surface. I could feel a presence that said &quot;I am with you&quot; in my thoughts. The presence felt as if it were made of pure love. I could feel a vibration drawing something out of my core on the right side of my belly. should I be afraid? What was it doing to me? I decided that whatever the case, even if it were drinking energy I would share it. Maybe it was scanning something it saw. Maybe it was feeding or healing me, i don&#039;t know but the sensation was pleasant and comforting.<br />There was music, like a really slow reggae dub thing and the patterned surface folded away and I was flying through this space high above everything toward a light like a sunset above another flyer who looked like he was flying a hang-glider. I stayed focused in this part for quite some time it seemed and like a dream it slowly faded as the music sounded farther and farther way. I was left with this amazing feeling of being loved very deeply. So much so i wept out of gratitude.

				This is fascinating.<br /><br />I have no idea what I&#039;m going to get when I try some of these.<br /><br />I hope I get to chat with my daemon.

				Thanks a lot for these reports. Never tried DMT so far but decided it was time after reading some recent reports here on the forum.<br />Put in my first order last week and expect it to arrive any time. Still need to buy / build a smoking/vapor-device, hope that part won&#039;t prove too much of a challenge as I really desire to get teleported to elfistan or whereever it is one goes on DMT.

				thanks I found the drawings and seems simple enough. Now I just hope the DMT arrives soon. It has been 12 days in transit so far which is the longest I have ever waited for an SR shipment. Hope nothing happened.

Sometimes shit happens but its good to work with people who can meet you in the middle when it&#039;s USPS. New DCN rules suck. Puts us all in a place of less certainty about our orders. <br /><br />I have bought from nearly every domestic rated 99+ Moon Unit&#039;s stuff is top of my list right now. I have a trip report but it is unwritten as of yet.
