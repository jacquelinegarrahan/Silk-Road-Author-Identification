				hey all,<br /><br />Check out what I stumbled on the other day...massive UK government opium-growing operation 8) <br /><br /><br />(http://i40.tinypic.com/209rt4z.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i43.tinypic.com/2eec1no.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i41.tinypic.com/15rxufd.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i41.tinypic.com/20funut.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i41.tinypic.com/16lk5y8.jpg)<br /><br />[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/29pp943.jpg[/IMG<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe me?&nbsp; &nbsp;Person I was with said &quot;oh they&#039;ll be growing them for the seeds&quot;.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; We don&#039;t eat quite that many poppy seed rolls.&nbsp; Check out the news....<br /><br /><br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2353535/Not-Afghanistan-Lincolnshire-Bumper-crop-lilac-morphine-poppies-grown-medicinal-purposes-heart-Britain.html <br /><br /><br />(Daily mail in particular is quite perturbed by this going on, as you might imagine).<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t usually believe in stealing from the NHS, but there is a morphine shortage for a reason, and that is because all the cheap opium we could be buying from the Afghanis (or at least that which is not sprayed by herbicides) is being diverted to the black market because of our ludicrous drug laws, and so I am all for helping ourselves to this bonanza. <br /><br />I also think it is unbelievable how many junkies do not know that their fix is just a couple of easy chemical conversions away from opium, which grows on our streets.&nbsp; So much nicer to harvest your own fresh from a flower.<br /><br />&nbsp;So please people.... go ahead and help yourself.&nbsp; It is prime harvest time right now....next week or two and the latex will be drying up (you can always just pick the pods, dry and grind them up.... but much nicer to have some sticky fragrant O).<br /><br />&nbsp;Personally I got about 1/4oz of product before time constraints, sun, paranoia and flies got the better of me.&nbsp; Best thing to do is locate a good spot (ideally go through a wood which backs onto a field... and make sure to leave your vehicle some distance from where you are doing your harvesting); on a sunny day slit a bunch of pods in the early evening with a sharp knife (be careful not to slit them too deeply or the latex will run back inside the poppy; just a few scratches needed).&nbsp; The the next day come back and scrape off the dried opium.<br /><br />Easier still: just slit the pods, collect the milk, and let it dry in a container.&nbsp; hell you can even just lick the milk up....but fuck me that is literally the most bitter shit I have ever come across.&nbsp; If you have even a basic knowledge of chemistry you can extract the morphine; and from there it is not much more work to diamorphine, should you be so inclined.<br /><br />Will need a bit of ageing (and ideally cooking; ie. boiling up and reducing) before it smokes well.&nbsp; But eating it is fine.&nbsp; Believe me: this shit works (after all, if the government are going to grow opium poppies, they are going to select the variety with the highest morphine yield).&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent the past few days in a very pleasant (if slightly itchy) haze......<br /><br />Here&#039;s the location:<br /><br /><br />https://maps.google.com/maps?q=3+heath+end+cottages&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.575149,-1.037135&amp;spn=0.016376,0.048795&amp;sll=51.599414,-1.056061&amp;sspn=0.032735,0.097589&amp;hnear=3+Heath+End+Cottages,+Nuffield,+Henley-on-Thames+RG9+5TD,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=15<br /><br /><br />The whole surrounding area is dotted with poppy-fields.<br /><br />(note: photo of helicopter included to stress that this is not a risk free enterprise.&nbsp; Now the poppies are at their peak they are being watched over.&nbsp; But really: it is not hard to dodge 1 helicopter.&nbsp; And I&#039;m telling you...there are fields and fields of these, and no-one around....)<br /><br />Happy harvesting!&nbsp; And do try not to get caught...just ruins it for the rest of us :-)

				No.&nbsp; the Daily Mail writes an article roughly once a year on this.... mainly they just change the region.&nbsp; It is a fine example of budget reporting: you just outrage counties one by one with the same recycled story:<br /><br />2007: http://tinyurl.com/cwo8cn (&quot;Illegal drugs grown in Oxfordshire!&quot;)<br />2008: http://tinyurl.com/3ztsvf (&quot;This isn&#039;t Afghanistan; it&#039;s Hampshire!&quot;)<br />2010: http://tinyurl.com/nogmzzn (&quot;Think this is Afghanistan? Wrong: it&#039;s Dorset.&quot;) <br />2011: http://tinyurl.com/6jusyhp (&quot;Drugs STILL grown in Dorset&quot;)<br />2013: http://tinyurl.com/khpzrt8 (&quot;Not Afghanistan but Lincolnshire!&quot;)<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />Note how they dissuade people from attempting to get in there with talk of how difficult heroin is to make from opium..&nbsp; First of all...it very much isn&#039;t.&nbsp; And secondly: why make heroin when you can have opium anyway?&nbsp; Lovely stuff.<br /><br />Unbelievably it seems to have worked though....I did see a few slashed pods during my meanders, but very little evidence of people getting in there otherwise.&nbsp; Its sad how ignorant many drug users are.... people will literally walk past these plants (grow like weeds... especially in the inner city) on their way to the scrapyard with an armful of rusty crap and not give them a second look.&nbsp; Jamie Oliver wouldn&#039;t be happy.<br />[/size]

				Just look in people&#039;s gardens, and scrappy bits of land.&nbsp; Usually they aren&#039;t planted purposefully...seeds just drift on the breeze and, they happen to like crappy soil.<br /><br />To be honest thought mate, you&#039;re looking at a good 10 poppies minimum for a decent effect, and then there is the fact that you never know which variety you&#039;ve found, and what kind of concentration of opiates they contain.&nbsp; I have obtained a fix from gardens before, and now is just th eright time of year, but it is a bit of a hassle.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;d be better off just ordering dried poppy pods online... not illegal.&nbsp; Nasty addiction though, so go easy!<br />

				poppies in above location are now dry.&nbsp; This means they can&#039;t be tapped... however they are ripe for the picking, grinding and tea-making.&nbsp; Get yourselves down there with a bin-bag before they disappear!

				you could of course go down the eco warrior route and grab some seeds and sow them on verges or wasteland, then you know exactly what you&#039;re getting when they flower.<br /><br />There&#039;s more of them but here&#039;s a sample.&nbsp; High Carts also has them but atm isn&#039;t selling any.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6cfa644427<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5790bbbe69<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f3e747120b<br /><br />and of course they&#039;ll brighten up the place, it&#039;s a win/win if you&#039;re so inclined ;)

				&nbsp;Not sure about planting on verges etc... would be very difficult to tap them in public.&nbsp; OTOH good if you are just doing it for tea (which is about 1000x less hassle generally, and pretty much just as good, given that the opium you do make will be poor quality, raw, and you probably don&#039;t have access to proper smoking equipment...)<br /><br />Precise location... in the link, it is the field with the rectangular brown patch in it, Mongewell Wood to the North, Bixmoor to the South.&nbsp; The latter is a good discreet way in.<br /><br />They are gone now.&nbsp; But the same field will no doubt be used next year (it is the same one as in one of the Daily Mail articles I linked to above...the one with Didcot power station in the background).<br /><br />Best time of year... well, poppies&#039; cycle is the reverse of weed, in that they start flowering once the hours of light per day exceeds a certain level... usually beginning of June.&nbsp; Ready for scoring around mid-July, and can continue to be scored till about mid August.&nbsp; After that they can still be picked and dried for tea till they get harvested at the end of August.<br /><br />I went back after they&#039;d been dug up (still plenty stray pods lying around :-).&nbsp; Surprised to see there were still helicopters.&nbsp; Then realised there is an army/airforce base nearby.&nbsp; So actually I was just being paranoid... they aren&#039;t being watched at all!&nbsp; Crazy really: some entrepreneurial spirit could rent a tractor with front-loader and trailer, drive in there and dig up enough poppies to make many thousands of pounds worth of heroin....<br /><br />By the way, I actually spoke to the land-owner... he drove past when I first came across them and was taking photos.&nbsp; He was quite friendly....said he just rents the land to the government and they do everything.&nbsp; So if you do decide to take a trip there next year, don&#039;t worry, you aren&#039;t taking anyone&#039;s livelihood (also there is a public footpath going across the land, so no need to worry about trespassing).<br /><br />It&#039;s a very odd grey area, the whole opium poppy thing.&nbsp; The DEA has a hard time treading the line between keeping it quiet that you can easily get hard drugs out of a legal garden plant, and stopping people actually doing so..,,good article about this here:<br /><br />http://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/opium-made-easy/<br /><br />It would be nice to know of other locations if anyone knows where they are... I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re grown beside the A303 and A34, but to the best of my knowledge this is the first time a field has been pinpointed.<br />

				It was only a matter of time.....I know people who are attempting coca plants as well, problem being the space. Just like with poppies, you need acres and acres to see a return.

				I heard (completely non-substantiated claim) that you can get a kilo of heroin from half an acre of poppies.&nbsp; Could fit that many in a large trailer no problem I should think....&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Not that this is something I would ever in a million years consider attempting.&nbsp; But imagine the satisfaction of making heroin from poppies you confiscated from the government!

When you see those pictures of Afghans in the big fields they could stand in one spot and touch dozens. If the goal is to grow a patch of easy flowers that look pretty and will get you high, then you don&#039;t even need a single acre. Just a portion of a small garden in a subdivision backyard would work. <br /><br />When I was practically opiate-naive a brew from three golf ball sized pods would get me pretty high for like 8 hours. Of course 3 became a dozen, then 20.... but someone with more restraint that me could grow a modest personal supply in their backyard and still have room for a cookout.

Anyway. I just wanted to chime in and say&nbsp; 8)it is not a good idea to post locations online, once the crops start appearing online it becomes impossible to harvest anything from there, also it puts people already working the fields in danger, if you know of a field, good for you keep ot quiet and try not to propagate media stories&nbsp; showing locations, all your doing for the most part is herding junkies to descend on a particular area with no fucking clue what they&#039;re doing and a high chance they&#039;re going to get arrested or beaten to fuck by private security firms. whats more it makes the jobs of peoople like us that harvest in bulk cladestinley a lot harder and a lot more dangerous. You wouldnt believe the types of retards that appeared at our last site aftwr it hit the news, as we did our final night there some skinny sick as fuck junkies turned up, started ripping up the poppies in the middle of the field and trying to chew on them, then proceeded to light a fire, they got savaged by the private security contractor before being arrested by the civil guards for probably another beating and stint in prison.&nbsp; People dont realise these places are dangerous and you shouldnt go of you dont know what your doing.

				I just re read the OP you really want to be careful about telling people that... its kinda transmittng the idea that there&#039;s acres of risk free drugs growing and you can just waltz in and start scoring poppy heads no problem, this is going to land them is serious shit, Bayer pays the government and the farmers a lot of money to ensure people found their serve as examples to others to have more sence. also as soon as LE see it as a risk spot por clandestine harvesting your fucked, it will be sattelite surveyed and have constant patrolls even when the location changes next year the security measures wont. all they need is an excuse to spend the extra surveillance budget, and currently your being that excuse. if you were commenting on a Spanish or French field you&#039;d currently be sifting through a lot of really pissed off people PM&#039;ing you. we dont tend to use UK fields as its rare to have a cropbtuere comparable tonsouthern Spain, so really its up to you, just my 2 cents

				Well... the way I see it, a) share the knowledge, and b) people are responsible for themselves.&nbsp; I&#039;m not gonna feel like I&#039;m to blame if someone goes and does something stupid.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think you&#039;re also exaggerating the risk here.&nbsp; Perhaps because the poppies you are talking about are grown by a private company?&nbsp; These are for the NHS.&nbsp; There is NO security.. I guarantee it.&nbsp; I went 3 times and saw not a soul.&nbsp; There is a public footpath going through the land.&nbsp; The Daily Mail has published photos pretty much pinpointing the fields.<br /><br />Saying: &quot;don&#039;t tell people where poppies grow because they might get themselves arrested&quot; is like saying &quot;don&#039;t sell people drugs because they might get addicted/harm themselves/whatever&quot;, and I believe to be against the spirit if this site.&nbsp; It is up to people to look after themselves... all I&#039;m doing is sharing some information.<br /><br />I do get where you&#039;re coming from, but it seems a bit selfish to not want anyone else on your field.&nbsp; And again, there is no private security.&nbsp; So with all respect, I have to disagree with you.&nbsp; Maybe the situation is different in Spain, I don&#039;t know.
