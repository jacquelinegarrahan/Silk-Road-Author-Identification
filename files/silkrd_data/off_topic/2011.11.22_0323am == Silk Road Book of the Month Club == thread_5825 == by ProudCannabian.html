				Hey everybody.<br />I think we need to inject some fun into Off Topic.<br />I propose a book club.&nbsp; We choose one book per month, get fucked up and read that somebitch.&nbsp; Then we come here and discuss that thing.<br /><br />I do pretty much all my reading these days on my iPhone, it allows me to read anywhere!&nbsp; Stanza is tha bomb.&nbsp; If you need the hookup on free ebooks (for stanza or megareader) that aren&#039;t over 100 years old, send me a PM.<br /><br />So I&#039;ll start us all off with one book, then we can vote on further books.<br />Robert Heinlein&#039;s Stranger in a Strange Land<br />This is one of my favorite books, and yes it is Sci-Fi, but it really speaks to me in a way no other book has.<br />I have three copies, and I&#039;m constantly giving it away to folks.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I&#039;m a Heinlein thumper!<br />Anyhow, I am pretty damned sure that if you don&#039;t have it, it can be had, cheap.&nbsp; Most libraries will have it too.<br /><br />As we read/discuss this book, we will soon arrive at December 15th, the deadline.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not a full month, but CHRISTMAS is coming!&nbsp; The most thought-provoking, and best post in here will receive a prize!<br />Yes, a PRIZE!<br />I will front the prize this first go, and we will see if we want to maybe do a group-buy for future prizes, or maybe the person who puts up a book will do it.&nbsp; Shit, maybe we&#039;ll even have a vendor or two sponsor our club!<br /><br />Get READING!!!! Time is running short!

				Haha I&#039;m down for this. Sounds like a gay old time!<br /><br />So do you have some secret of getting the book on some e-reader for free or am I going to have to spend hard earned $$? Either way, sounds fun.

				Thanks Variety Jones for posting the text.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have an E source for Stranger myself, but for many other books, using stanza or megareader you can get them by adding a book source called Operation Alpha.&nbsp; The URL is http://www.operation-alpha.com/catalogue/c/catalog.xml

				Well, seeing as this thing doesn&#039;t seem to be up and running yet I thought I&#039;d share one of my favourite short stories with you all :)<br /><br />It&#039;s called The Jaunt, it&#039;s a very short horror/sci-fi story by Stephen King. Quite unsettling and very interesting concept, I&#039;ll leave it at that.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link: http://www.freebooks4u.net/horror/The_Jaunt/<br /><br />If you&#039;ve got fifteen minutes to spare you should be reading this

				Oh this is running all right... folks better be reading!&nbsp; I wanna hear some feedback/discussion on the book if someone wants the PRIZE!<br /><br />TY for the short story alphanumericnameguy.<br /><br />RI - If no one has read the book, how do we know it exists?&nbsp; :P<br /><br />One interesting fact about Stranger in a Strange Land is that it actually spawned a halfass religion, though it was not endorsed by Heinlein.&nbsp; (unlike that other crazy religion created by an SF author) Over a short time, it moved further and further away from the ideas in the book, to the point where it just became a salad of religious ideas.<br /><br />I really like the creche idea, where you and a number of like-minded others that can group together into an economic and social unit.&nbsp; You don&#039;t HAVE to sleep with everyone in the unit, but you all work towards the success of the &quot;family&quot; unit.&nbsp; Each person has &quot;shares&quot; and if they want to leave they take their share with them.

				This is a brilliant idea, Heinlein&#039;s great. the missus got me a copy of &#039;The moon is a strange mistress&#039; a while back. I&#039;ll start reading tomorrow morning, love saturday coffee, radio 4 and book in bed&nbsp; :)<br /><br />We&#039;ve all read Doors of Perception, Farenheit 451, all those big counter-culturey favourites.<br />I&#039;d recommend one of Kurkov&#039;s books, they&#039;re a bit off beat, quite dark but not too heavy going, all can be read in an afternoon. Love the post-Soviet, anarchy in a new free market themes.

				OK. I&#039;m gonna extend this until Sunday.&nbsp; Give people more time to read the book.<br />It&#039;s busy around this time of year!&nbsp; I know I can get through it in two days, but I&#039;ve read it so many times it&#039;s like I&#039;m just refreshing my memory.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />SO, due to Christmas shipping issues (high volume, etc.) the prize will likely not make it to your doorstep in time for XMas, but I can prolly get it to you for New Years!<br /><br />The prize will be a single hit of kickass, PROUDly tested LSD.&nbsp; ;)<br />I can either ship direct from myself, or work out a single hit-buy with one of the amazing vendors we have here on SR for those of you who wish to avoid revealing their address to me via PM.

				I started reading Stranger in a Strange Land after seeing it in this thread- I had heard about Heinlein for years from various geeky gaming buddies (well, &#039;TANSTAAFL&#039; and &#039;Grok&#039; sums up my entire prior knowledge), but as a history nerd, I venture into the fiction land maybe once a year or so. So glad I did. Haven&#039;t read any Sci Fi since Asimov in like 4th grade, and robots didn&#039;t do much for me (sorry, I am just rambling).<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m only about 1/4 of the way through (Boardman just got hired, Duke just got fired), but am really enjoying the selection- thank you!

				That&#039;s not cheating!&nbsp; You&#039;re just ready to rock this thread is all.&nbsp; ;)<br />Does anything about the book stick out to you?&nbsp; Some people find it very utopian, and other discount it as the hornyness of old fellas in the 50&#039;s, lol.<br /><br />I probably shouldn&#039;t have chosen one of the busiest months of the year to do this though.<br />I wound up getting caught in a snowstorm over the weekend and, well, here I am!<br />So, I propose a further extension to January 1st.&nbsp; At that point we can discuss the book further (maybe we can all get some reading done with turkey/goose/ham in our bellies) and I can pick a winner by the end of that first week of January.<br /><br />This first prize I will fund myself, but we could maybe get SR or Nomad to open a secure book club account that we could all contribute a small fee into to cover the cost of future, bigger and better prizes than a single dose of LSD, as will be provided this time.
