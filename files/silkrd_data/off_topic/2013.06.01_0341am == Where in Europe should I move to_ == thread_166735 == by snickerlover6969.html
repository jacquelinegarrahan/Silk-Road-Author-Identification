				I would go with Germany, Switzerland or Austria, especially since you speak a little German. Austria and Switzerland are better countries for drugs but in Germany drugs laws aren&#039;t so hard either. The Netherlands are good for drugs but it depends what kind of stuff you&#039;re into. In the Netherlands there&#039;s mostly good weed and psychedielics, it&#039;s good to get street drugs too but not all of them are high quality like their weed and hallucinogens. They also have good free healthcare there. If you like pharmaceuticals I&#039;d go in Germany... Ketamine is legal (not a controlled substance) there too so if you like ketamine, go there. Austria and Switzerland are about the same as Germany, more street drugs in Austria and more pharms Switzerland. Drug laws are really good in those four countries, Switzerland&#039;s laws being even better than the Dutch ones.<br /><br />There&#039;s also the UK but I wouldn&#039;t want to live there with all their cameras everywhere. Spain and Portugal are also good places for drugs. But overall, the nicest place to live would be those German speaking countries, the quality of life is the best in Switzerland, then Germany, then Austria. But Swiss German is really annoying so there&#039;s that. You also have good beer there! If it&#039;s not drugs you care about most I wouldn&#039;t chose the Netherlands, it&#039;s a nice country but has the shittiest weather. France could also be nice but the laws are more restrictive, they have a key disclosure law, like in the UK but harsher, for example. Apart from that, you have better public healthcare and education than in most other (if not all) European countries. Doctors are also apparently very script happy for benzos there. Italy seems pretty strict too but I don&#039;t know much about Italy except that it&#039;s nice to be there as a tourist, like Spain. I don&#039;t know much about Belgium and Luxembourg but they&#039;re similar to the Netherlands and the German speaking countries.<br /><br />So all in all it depends on exactly what you&#039;re looking for. I think Germany is one of the EU countries with most freedom, they don&#039;t have a mandatory data retention law, and cops are all friendly there, even their riot control forces. Switzerland is annoying with customs, and there are a lot of thieves in Austria but they have even better laws, so it&#039;s up to you to choose what you like best.

				Well from my point of view it&#039;s shit (I&#039;m on the left) but the current British government is running the country from a centre right standpoint. Merkel&#039;s CDU would also fall under that umbrella and while we think of Amsterdam as being a liberal mecca, the Netherlands themselves are run by VVD another centre right party. <br /><br />Edit: Oops, I thought you were the op Limetless.

				Very true. In betraying their routes they basically pulled all sides of British politics to the centre. There&#039;s so little separating the parties now. You never know, the rise of UKIP and the swivel-eyed loons might lead us back to a left/right system.

				I don&#039;t really think there is a need for the old left and right system tbh. Communism and Socialism failed and Capitalism won, neither the extremes of both systems nor the left and right work. We should be focused more on Libertarianism now the Commies ain&#039;t bashing down our door.

				I&#039;d say Northern Switzerland/Southern Germany.&nbsp; You have the alps there, all the great bavarians/swiss. Also, there are a higher amount of americans living in southern germany because of the military base the U.S. had there so maybe that will be a nice comfort for you.&nbsp; Otherwise, I am a big fan of the people in sweden.

				If people should work long hours and whole evenings in big markets is pretty fucked up too. I see those people everyday. Where I&#039;m from here&#039;s not a one day in a year when supermarkets are closed. These people have only this job to get money for living but more than half of them are too tired to live because of this kind of a work. <br /><br />Anyway, I would not recommend to choose country by accessible market of drugs. You can use SR everywhere. Study the cultures or take a trip around Europe. You should choose the place where people are familiar, where you can melt in easily and find good opportunities for work. Some places are like girls, you know it form the first sight if you want to stay. I think you don&#039;t get the best answer from forums.

				Thank you for all your replies...<br /><br />I will be going backpacking throughout Europe here in the near future...I was thinking either Germany, Netherlands, UK or Spain.<br /><br />After reading all your replies I think I&#039;m leaning more towards Germany now. Also, I&#039;m not doing it so much for the drugs, ok that was a lie yes it&#039;s mostly for the drugs&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;D but I also want learn as much as I can about making electronic music since Europe is where all the best EDM producers come from.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW I&#039;m into psychedelics and not so much pharms...Mostly MDMA.

				Natürlich sollen Sie nach Deutschland gehen! At least for the time being, Germany has laws prohibiting surveillance (see Stasi), something which is increasingly a problem in many parts of the Western world. Even on Google Earth you&#039;ll find whole building blurred out, simply because the residents don&#039;t want you to look up their house.

				Not to be a downer, but how exactly do you plan on doing this? It is extremely difficult for an American (or anyone who isn&#039;t a citizen of the EU) to emigrate to Europe. I would kill to live in France, because unless you are super rich or have connections it is almost impossible.

Countries of the EU accept a lot more immigrants than the US, and they&#039;re mostly from the third world. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d reject someone that probably has a college degree and is more likely to find a job than most immigrants there that mostly end up working as cashiers or other jobs like that. <br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s easier for a European to enter the US than it is for a Mexican for example, not to criticize people from poorer countries but it&#039;s how most immigration policies work.
