				I&#039;d like to know this too. <br /><br />You can get great IDs but the question is do they work for getting a passport with them or crossing the border with them.&nbsp; I seem some that have active magnetic strips.&nbsp; It&#039;s the license number on the card that would worry me , which name comes up. <br /><br />So if anyone could verify if fake IDs sold here would work for crossing the border or getting a passport with. <br />A Canadian vendor has great Ontario license with health card as 2nd piece. I think it&#039;s enough to get a passport with , or at least apply for a birth certificate.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;d need to know a name ( an identity) to steal.&nbsp; This way all the name and numbers show up in the systems.

				Damn, it seems like it&#039;s going to be pretty difficult pulling this off. So you need a passport to enter any country leaving the US?

				Don&#039;t the passports have ID chips in them now? Is there any way to produce those under the table? I&#039;ve wondered how I would escape the country if I needed to, and the only idea I&#039;ve come up with (and it is probably useless) is to get to Mexico &amp; &quot;adopt&quot; a new identity there, then travel from there as though you were a mexican citizen. Of course, this would involve learning at least 1 new language, then learning perhaps another (I&#039;m thinking island-hopping in the Carribean). This subject brings up a book I read a couple of years ago called &quot;How to Disappear&quot; by Frank M. Ahearrn. It&#039;s both useful and entertaining, but first off, don&#039;t use a credit card to buy it (digital trail).

				My partner and I have spoken about this extensively.&nbsp; While not felons, we don&#039;t want to be tracked out of the country, for personal reasons.. <br /><br />&nbsp;There are a lot of ways out of the country... It just depends on how much money you have and if you ever plan to come back or not.. <br /><br />Simple least expressive.. Get down to a gulf coast state and get on a boat, buy boat pay to be on someone else boat... You can leave small marinas in the US and land in Small marinas / coast line or the such in Mexico, the Caribbean, Cuba, and South America..&nbsp; If you bring down an ID like you said from Canada to a less developed country its not going to be an issue.. If you have cash and an income to live on and do not need to apply to work then its pretty simple.. Getting a work permit and such can be more tricky.. It really comes down to where in the world you want to go and just how legal you want to be there really..

				Getting out of the country is one thing, but do you plan to come back in? That would be the harder part.<br />The best way (in my opinion) to get a fake identity is to pay someone who doesn&#039;t have a passport to give you their info. <br />There are also plenty of ways to cross into Canada or Mexico illegally, if you know the right people. <br />
