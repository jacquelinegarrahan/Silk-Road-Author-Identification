				Alright, so am currently watching the documentary &quot;What the bleep do we know&quot; and it basically discusses how everything we see is how we perceive it and basically that if we TRULY believed we could walk on water then we could do it.&nbsp; I&#039;m weird and find a lot of this stuff fascinating/interesting and want to dive into it some more.<br /><br />As a kid I read a book about a guy who spent hours meditating staring at a candle and was eventually able to extinguish/light the candle with just his mind.&nbsp; All this tied in with the teachings of monks etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Basically, where can I find more information on this type of stuff?&nbsp; Trust me, I already know I am crazy so no need to tell me that&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Also, do you guys agree with me that Psychedelics/Quantum Physics etc... may all tie in with each other?

				that documentary has been thoroughly debunked and a lot of the people interviewed in it said they edited footage selectively to skew what they were actually saying <br /><br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/may/16/g2.science<br /><br />Quantum physics are real, The Religion Of Quantum Physics is a religion based on misinterpretation of quantum physics.

The fact that you can explore the innards of something as intricate and complex as your own conscience (with or without the aid of a substance) is incredible. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything wrong with being even slightly interested in learning about this. Yes, there are some weirdos who attempt to (and often times inaccurately) interpret these phenomena, but there&#039;s not much literature on these subjects, so it will, usually by default, seem strange.<br /><br />sdesu

				This has always fascinated me as well. I&#039;ve seen a report which detailed monks that we&#039;re able to physically change their body temperature through meditation in order to survive the intense cold they we&#039;re living in. It just completely blew my mind! :D

				Sure learning about the human psych is interesting, there are plenty of books on it with titles like &#039;Introduction to psychology&#039; that don&#039;t cite people like Bob the 35 year old Caucasian shaman from the suburbs talking about the revelations he had after he smoked some DMT. I would rather learn about the effect DMT has on the brain that triggers people to experience spiritual revelations, than learn all about Bobs drug induced revelations, like they have anything to actually teach others. I like learning about spirituality, psychology, quantum physics, etc...but I like what I learn to have a basis in reality. So far everything suggested here has no basis in reality, the quantum physics documentary has been called absurd by every real quantum physicist who saw it (and some of the ones interviewed in it, who claim the people who made it cherry picked and edited the hell out of what they had to say). The DMT documentary essentially consists of people taking the effects of DMT far too seriously and trying to map their experiences to reality to an excessive extent. I hate to be a kill joy but I am just firmly grounded in reality, it is fascinating enough for me

				I found some of the &quot;scientists&quot; talking during What The Bleep to be interesting but the fictional story line WAS SO FUCKING BAD.&nbsp; It reminded me of how I felt when I tried watching Inception when I was high as fuck, nothing made sense at all.&nbsp; Honestly, who thought of that story line... it was really, really dumb.&nbsp; I think DMT: The Spirit Molecule had a lot of BS in it but I do really like Joe Rogan commentaries and I don&#039;t think its too bad of a documentary to introduce people to the idea of DMT.&nbsp; Obviously alot of the hype is just to make money.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone mentioned documentaries on shamans/monks etc... I find all that stuff to be really interesting.&nbsp; I just finished watching<br /><br />Ram Dass: Fierce Grace&nbsp; - Really interesting documentary about LSD and spirituality.&nbsp;

				I am loving the large skeptical contingent on this site. Drug taking skeptics. I think I&#039;ve found my &#039;spiritual&#039; home if you&#039;ll excuse the expression.<br /><br />That a Buddhist monk can lower his body temperature by power of his mind I find feasible although I would like to see it tested properly. <br />Extinguishing a candle by pure mind power? I&#039;d be very surprised, Quantum Physics notwithstanding.<br /><br />Anyway if you asked a true zen master to extinguish a candle with the power of his mind he would lean forward and blow it out.

				I think the problem is that a lot of modern science sounds like it is just made up and so these pseudo scientists think they can just make stuff up too. But quantum physics for example hasn&#039;t just been made up. It has been reluctantly arrived at by scientists because despite its bizarre implications it makes incredibly accurate predictions about the behavior of particles.<br /><br />
