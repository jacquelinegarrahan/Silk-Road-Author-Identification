				So...I&#039;ve been laying in bed for the past couple days due to a fractured ankle &amp; decided to sit and think about SR &amp; LE. I&#039;m also on a plethora of substances right now...so bare with me.<br /><br />The ENTIRE WORLD knows about SR. Law enforcement in over 100 countries have known for at least 2 years now. <br /><br />I&#039;m sitting here doing a bunch of meth-head calculations &amp; the sheer number of government agencies that have to be investigating is ridiculous. I bet there&#039;s at least a couple THOUSAND of accounts on here that are made by LE from any country. Considering the time that they&#039;ve known about SR, there could be LE-owned forum accounts that everybody thinks is a veteran of SR. People we respect here at SR...could potentially be some random cyber-pig just trying to blend in. <br /><br />Respectable members of SR could simply be LE trying to be buddy-buddy with top vendors until they get close enough to BAM.<br /><br />Given the sheer amount of people around the WORLD trying to shut SR down, it is highly likely that there are thousands of rats in our midst. Although, most of you must already know that.<br /><br />Once again, I&#039;m on multiple things right now so call me a paranoid dumbass if this is all stupid cause...idk.
