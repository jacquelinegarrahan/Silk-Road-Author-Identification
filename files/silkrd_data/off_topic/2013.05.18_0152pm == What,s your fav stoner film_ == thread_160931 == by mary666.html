				Friday is a good choice.. Mine was always Dazed and Confused. I was a senior in high school when that came out so the timing was perfect. That is DEF my all time favorite stoner movie.&nbsp; ;) ...<br /><br />Edit: Great thread btw.... some of the cheech and chong movies are great couch lock flicks too.

				Lammbock if its gotta be a stoner one.<br /><br />Best drugs based ones are Trainspotting, Candy and Fear and Loathing (though Naked Lunch should be considered a drug movie too and it beats them all)<br /><br />Next time you take LSD take the &quot;Naked Lunch Movie Challenge&quot;

				Pineapple Express! I know its kind of an obvious pot-head movie (what with the plot and all) <br /><br />I didnt find the &#039;Friday&#039; series that good though and I&#039;ve seen em all. <br />&#039;Boondock Saints&#039; series is probably top 5 films for me ever, ill watch it high or sober idc great movie no matter what.<br />and &#039;Always Sunny&#039; is my Shit!!!!<br /><br />Speaking of TV shows, Dave Chapelle&#039;s show is great too.<br /><br />Great thread idea btw

				When I first started smoking is when Pineapple Express came out and I absolutely love it. James Franco and Seth Rogan are hilarious. <br /><br />Other great ones, half baked, supertroopers<br /><br />Not a stoner movie, but I love Fear and Loathing.

				Did they even smoke weed in Fear and Loathing?&nbsp; Not really a stoner film but it is a good film.<br /><br />Well lets see what hasn&#039;t been listed already.<br /><br />Easy Rider is a classic.&nbsp; All of the joints they smoked in that movie were the real deal!<br /><br />High School was a funny movie.

				Super Troopers ! Haha me and my buddy would get cooked and watch it every lunch break in high school. Fear and Loathing, Half Baked, How High, and grandmas boy were all favourites.<br /><br />If I&#039;m in a serious sort of headspace, American History X and my favourite movie of all time: Requiem for a Dream.<br /><br />great thread.
