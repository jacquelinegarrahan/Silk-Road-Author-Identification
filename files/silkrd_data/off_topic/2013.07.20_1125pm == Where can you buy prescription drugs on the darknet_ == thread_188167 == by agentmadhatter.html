				You&#039;re gonna trust some guy out there with stuff that can kill you if it&#039;s contaminated or worse? You might as well try to look for a local guy who&#039;s willing to bust into a pharmacy or something. Or bribe a pharmacist.

				What prescription drug can you possibly want that SR doesn&#039;t have? If it&#039;s not on SR, its probably not worth your time...just my opinion on this.

				The &quot;Possible LE&quot; wasn&#039;t looking for help, he was probably looking to see if there were any more new sites floating around, they have not heard about yet.

				Exactly what&#039;s I&#039;d been thinking...&nbsp; just want to say that I don&#039;t make a habit of pointing fingers at people and accusing them of being this or that ..&nbsp; especially with no proof.&nbsp; But I had been about to get off the computer when the post for this thread caught my eye and I suddenly got that ..&nbsp; creepy crawly lead in the stomach feeling that I get when one or more of them are nearby...&nbsp; IRL...&nbsp; &nbsp;and maybe online too..&nbsp; &nbsp; not saying I&#039;ve any more proof of that than I did the other day, but regardless, I wasn&#039;t going to write anything before I checked out the profile of the OP - I mean...&nbsp; O.K. 54 posts, but for all I knew, he could have been a long time much beloved member who just doesn&#039;t post much and I wouldn&#039;t want to have made such a suggestion if that were the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;But what I saw was that he had registered the day before he made this post, the other 3 after the first 50 which he spammed his way through by putting a smiley in each one.... were all made in the other thread he started... again, appearing to be looking for something.&nbsp; A particular book..&nbsp; Ron Paul&#039;s Book(?)&nbsp; Idk what that is, but he seemed to be trying to track it down...&nbsp; posts in that thread made me feel even more creepy crawley....&nbsp; so, then I felt O.K. to post what I felt might be the case.&nbsp; <br /><br />Always hoping not, but if so...&nbsp; &nbsp;good for people to be careful..&nbsp; and on second look tonight, I do think that several of the people who replied did so the way they did because they may have had suspicions as well...&nbsp; <br /><br />&#039;Cheers! ;)

No fucking way!<br /><br />My god a lot of you like to jump on the must be LE......how about just a dumb fuck asking a stupid fucking question!&nbsp; Those of you that are not vendors....welcome to our world. This is a perfect example of shit we get asked on a daily basis. This is just someone that wants drugs...can&#039;t find what he needs for some reason...so he makes a post asking where else he could get it that would not be eBay. And trust me...this guy would go to BMR right now...and would buy what he is looking for 100% with out even thinking about getting scammed or getting in trouble IRL. This is actually a TYPICAL person that us as vendors deal with.<br /><br /><br />There is no reason at all to think this is LE. In fact there is every reason to think this is just a guy that wants a certain drug and can not find it on SR.... Though the funny thing is if he actually wrote a thread with the title&nbsp; &quot; Where on SR can I get XXXX&quot; he would have gotten a few answers of vendors to go to. In fact..he would have gotten at least 4 people saying the exact same thing to him...because that is how the forums work.<br /><br />But what this really shows is how stupid all of us are for even responding to this moron. In fact...these are the exact type of threads that should be locked right away. As these forums would be a lot better off if that happened. But I do like the free speech part of the forums...and not locking any threads at all. Even stupid pointless ones like this. Also I am not trying to bash anyone in here that commented saying he is LE. That is your opinion and that is what the forums are about..giving your opinion. I mean no disrespect to you guys.I just gave my opinion.
