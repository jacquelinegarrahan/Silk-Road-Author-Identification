				I was looking at a vendor who makes fake script labels (namedeclined (96) ) and i was wondering if labels would work at a pre employment drug test..<br />I took a test this morning, and may have failed.. (benzos). Will they just look at the fake label and say yea it looks legit or will they call the &quot;DR&quot; listed on the prescription bottle (or the pharmacy) ?<br />or is that an invasion of my privacy for them to call my Doc or my pharmacy..?<br />Test was a swab if that helps..

				Up for debate. But I&#039;d say that whatever prescription labels you get off here will be slightly off and not be printed on legitimate feeling paper. I&#039;ve seen some fake labels and if you compare them to the legitimate thing you can tell they&#039;re a little off. I&#039;d say they&#039;re only good for storing or transporting small amounts of drugs as a safeguard against possession charges.

				Before the test, did they ask you if you are taking any prescriptions. It will look very suspicious if you now have an empty bottle with a brand new label. I might take the loss and not go back.

				they gave me a mouth swab test at the office i was being interviewed. After the interview, they asked me to step in the next room so they can swab&nbsp; my mouth. apparenlty she mails it off to a diff state (kansas)&nbsp; and they do the testing.. I wonder what would happen if benzos showed up, would they have to call my DR? would i fax over a copy of my script labels to kansas/?

				Well since you said something to her about you having prescription that makes it a lot more believable. If you are sure it will come back positive (72 hours I think) I think I might try it. Especially if its just your employer you will have to explain the results to, I think it will be fine with an empty labeled bottle. If its a testing facility they might have protocol to follow that includes checking Dr name/number etc, thats only speculation though.
