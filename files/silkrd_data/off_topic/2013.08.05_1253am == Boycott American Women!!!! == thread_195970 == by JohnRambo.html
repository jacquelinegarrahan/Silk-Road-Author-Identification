				BOYCOTT AMERICAN WOMEN<br />Why American men should not marry American women<br /><br />http://boycottamericanwomen.blogspot.com/<br /><br />I am an American man, and I have decided to boycott American women. In a nutshell, American women are the most likely to cheat on you, to divorce you, to get fat, to steal half of your money in the divorce courts, don&#039;t know how to cook or clean, don&#039;t want to have children, etc. Therefore, what intelligent man would want to get involved with American women?<br /><br />American women are generally immature, selfish, extremely arrogant and self-centered, mentally unstable, irresponsible, and highly unchaste. The behavior of most American women is utterly disgusting, to say the least.<br /><br />This blog is my attempt to explain why I feel American women are inferior to foreign women (non-American women), and why American men should boycott American women, and date/marry only foreign (non-American) women.<br /><br />I encourage ALL American men to NEVER MARRY American women, and date/marry only foreign (non-American) women.<br /><br />A few more reasons to stay away from American women?<br /><br />-30 percent of American women take psychiatric drugs.<br />-25 percent of women under the age of 30 have at least one STD.<br />-85 percent of divorces in America are INITIATED by women, thus women are responsible for the vast majority of divorces.<br />-70 percent of criminals in America were raised by single mothers, thus feminism is responsible for most crime in America.<br />-60 percent of American women are fat, overweight, according to government statistics<br /><br />If you want to get married, find a nice foreign girl from Asia, or South America, or Russia/Eastern Europe. DO NOT MARRY AN AMERICAN WOMAN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!<br /><br />Give American women the husband they deserve- NONE!<br /><br />BOYCOTT AMERICAN WOMEN!

				Fuck me dude, its a free world and all but to be honest I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve read a more pathetic post in my life, and I don&#039;t even know any American women.&nbsp; <br />.<br />If a small dick is the problem John Rambo then that should be the title of your thread.&nbsp; Because that&#039;s the only point you seem to be making.

				Although I agree with boycotting American women, I disagree with all your foolish reasons why.<br />American women are uncultured and quite frankly, retarded. The smart, pretty ones are always taken.<br />They also don&#039;t know how to behave in bed, unlike women from other regions of the world.<br /><br />I do agree with cooking and cleaning, however.<br /><br /><br />Basically, a woman needs to be better than me at everything, and typically American women cant hold a candlestick to the sexiness of european or asian women.
