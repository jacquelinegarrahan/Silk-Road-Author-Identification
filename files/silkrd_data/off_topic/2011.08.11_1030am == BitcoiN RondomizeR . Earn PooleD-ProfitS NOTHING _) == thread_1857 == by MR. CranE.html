				This things pretty interesting. For a half a btc investment you gain residual income potentially forever. Ive only been in 2 rounds and already quadrupled my investment. Try it out. Use my link please or the reference will be placed randomly. Ideally all of us here on Silk should get in on this :)<br /><br />http://rand.bitcat.ch/?ref=83<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				I&#039;m truly, utterly and completely sorry to see this thread/novelty idea populating the Silk Road forum.<br /><br />I was hoping that as other sane, quiet, intelligent minds spoke forth on this subject that all involved would take a second look and realize the futility of this pursuit.&nbsp; It is quite obvious now that this will not be the road taken by some.<br /><br />I have to agree with Kind Bud and redtide *emphatically* in that a willingness to participate shows a lack of good, common sense and also a willingness to see others get screwed.&nbsp; My take also is that people willing to participate will find, much to their dismay and probably they will never admit to the forum, that they bet &quot;once too often&quot; and the last set of bets lost more than their lifetime of &quot;winnings&quot;.&nbsp; The empirical ratcheting upward of the bets makes this an absolute certainty.&nbsp; And what is the probability that the person who would initiate such tomfoolery would also turn out to be a scammer, a la MyBitCoin?&nbsp; I put the odds at 1000%.<br /><br />It can only be properly termed &quot;harm reduction&quot; to also advise not doing business with anyone who participates.&nbsp; Foolishness in ones private life inevitably carries over to ones business life as well.&nbsp; Which is a shame, because despite having made a hodgepodge of his initial listings and insisting on his wacky capitalizations, MR. CranE has proven to be a trustworthy seller on SR and I kind of liked his style.&nbsp; Pity.<br /><br />

				It sounds like people know what they are getting into and willingly choosing to do so. I am not going to do it because I realize it sounds like a boring way to lose money. <br /><br />&quot;A willingness to see others get screwed&quot; is basically gambling. Everyone knows that someone has to lose for someone else to win - its not evil. Everyone goes in knowing the risks and hoping for the best. <br /><br />Mr. Crane is an honest dealer and shouldn&#039;t be boycotted simply for playing a ponzi scheme game - he isn&#039;t trying to steal your money, just turn you on to something he has found to be fun. Now saying you are guaranteed to win is complete bullshit and has no place when discussing ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes.<br /><br />It looks just like another form of gambling.
