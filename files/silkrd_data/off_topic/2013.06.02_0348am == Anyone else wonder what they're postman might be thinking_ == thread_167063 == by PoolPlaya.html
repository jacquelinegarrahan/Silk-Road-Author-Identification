				I happen to get a few deliveries in the same week and I live in small town usa at this point in time.&nbsp; I get 3 USPS boxes, all with to: and from: stickers on them and they WEIGH NEXT TO NOTHING!<br /><br />Because I&#039;m buying weed, they basically feel empty.<br /><br />Was just wondering if other people when they&#039;re sitting around high and are spacing away thinking off the wall thoughts, ever think about what their postman must be thinking when he keeps delivering these boxes that have the weight of &quot;empty&quot; in them :)<br /><br />I read about all these people that have 50 transactions in 8 months and stuff and wonder if their postman ever asks himself if he finds those kind of deliveries just a little odd.<br /><br />sorry, just one of those &quot;things that make you go hmmmmm.&quot; posts :D

				A postman once snatched my weed. The package was minimally opened on the top and nothing was left inside.

				He&#039;s probably thinking that he wishes he would have made different choices so he didn&#039;t have to be a postman. I&#039;ve known quite a few postal employees. Most of them absolutely hated every minute of the job, but were stuck with it because it pays relatively well based on their skillset/experience.<br /><br />However, I have met a few who bought into the whole thing hook, line, and sinker. Those are the one&#039;s who smile too much at the postal counter.<br /><br />If they get a hold of your packages they are probably thinking &quot;Look at this nice young man, loving their country and being patriotic by using the post office.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m a postman and I don&#039;t give a shit about the weight. People ship all kinds of stuff in the mail, there&#039;s no reason to suspect or even think of drugs just because it&#039;s light.
