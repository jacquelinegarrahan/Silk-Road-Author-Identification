				Inspired by the heroin thread, I&#039;m curious if there are any functioning meth addicts out there? Meth and meth users both have hugely negative stereotypes and social stigmas, but for me I notice that meth enhances my creativity and puts me more in the moment for my daily life, allowing me to engage with it on a more productive and enjoyable level. Of course the dose is of utmost importance here. You can&#039;t smoke a gram a day and expect to function, but a small bump here and there throughout the day works pretty well for me. I may be in minority, but I believe meth is a very beneficial drug when used responsibly.

				Personally, I take offense to being roped into the category of &quot;addicts&quot;. Addiction implies weakness. I use, infrequently. And it&#039;s not a big deal if I don&#039;t for a month or two. I will agree that the stigma is bad, but we have the addicts to thank for that.

				What most people don&#039;t understand is that there is a very important and difficult-to-define line between drug use and drug abuse.<br /><br />I consider myself a drug user because I use drugs to enhance my life experiences, not escape them.

				I&#039;ve functioned on meth in moderate dosages, then also on very small dosages (20mg/day), under Desoxyn (ADHD med). I&#039;d say that in reflection while I never got addicted, to some degree my perspective on my functioning was skewed. I thought I was more together than I really was at some points. It&#039;s important to be objective. <br /><br />Objectively review your career and financial situation. It&#039;s easy to feel you&#039;re being productive when you have a million ideas and so much energy, but they say slow and steady wins the race, and there&#039;s truth to that. So no excuses, look at your job stability and income. Look at your spending - if you&#039;re middle class meth won&#039;t put much of a dent itself into your finances, but the impulsive spending that it often inspires can.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly, I think the one thing you can&#039;t escape, functioning or not, is that if you&#039;re using socially, people will know. It&#039;s so easy to think, if you are using moderately, that you just seem more social and energized, and people can&#039;t tell. But they can, particularly anyone who&#039;s used or knows someone who&#039;s used. You get a false reassurance though because people keep that kind of thing to themselves. Most people are very intuitive at picking up moods and subtle clues about how their friends are doing. They may not even realize it&#039;s drugs, but you can&#039;t help but give off an aura that will stand out. Video tape yourself around friends, highs, lows, they can be very surprising when you reflect on them later. <br /><br />I also believe it&#039;s important to have a sober friend who you confide your drug usage to. If you&#039;re too ashamed then there&#039;s something wrong. That person, once aware, can keep you in check, tell you if you look wired, or if your drug use is starting to have observable negative consequences. They know what they are looking for, so it doesn&#039;t take your life crashing and burning to get intervention, you can have someone step in before you misstep.<br /><br />Just my 2c.

				No such thing. I did it for a couple of years. I would binge, clean up and go 2-3 months<br />and then binge again. The time started getting shorter between binges and I saw 3 dealers get popped. I walked away and haven&#039;t touched it since. In the moment, the high is amazing. But the ramifications physically, emotionally and from an LE standpoint are just not worth it.

				it seems to be a functioning thing at first, but the constant use can turn into a road-block. the occasional binge can be fun, if conditions allow i.e. no responsibilities.... just tweek&#039;n out

				You can&#039;t do meth a couple days a week an everyone in your life not notice a difference in you.<br />You can randomly have a binge or two a year and function well but as a weekly thing....no, being that you have access to it daily.<br />Meth changes your sleeping , eating and thinking habits very quickly and it is not pretty.<br />I know &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; is an Awesome show and it even partially shows how sick and depraved meth addicts get but the reality in meth users is far worse than you can imagine.
