				I just finished up watching this comedy. I don&#039;t have much else to do right now so thought why not. Quite hilarious. A kid in the beginning talks the rock&#039;s son into letting him order a shit load of ecstacy to his house for him. He gets busted with a controlled delivery and the rock goes narc for his son! Rofl. <br /><br />They even had a little device in the package that could tell he opened it. Suprisingly the movie seems anti-drug war. Had a quote showing how much more people are imprisoned for drugs than for rape at the end of the movie. Its a pretty terrible movie but good for comedic value when you are fucked up.

				Yes, IMO this was a good movie. <br /><br />The movie focuses on the Dad&#039;s (the Rock&#039;s) attempt to help his kid out. The kid gets CD&#039;d and gets hauled off to jail. The primary focus of the movie is that the war on drugs is stupid. There are several scenes that talk specifically about the over reach of the war on drugs.<br /><br />Specifically, they state, several times and truthfully, that you can get more time for being in possession of X drug than you can for murder or rape.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll go re-watch it now.

				I agree, I seen this &amp; could not stop Lol&#039;ing!<br /><br />At the beginning when he was ordering I was picking all the things he was doing wrong a part! <br /><br />I was thinking &quot;Should have read my guide on the forums...&quot; lol<br /><br />OK movie, I just liked it because the whole drugs in mail kick.....<br /><br />In reality all the &quot;drug dealers&quot; in the movie are completely idiotic!
