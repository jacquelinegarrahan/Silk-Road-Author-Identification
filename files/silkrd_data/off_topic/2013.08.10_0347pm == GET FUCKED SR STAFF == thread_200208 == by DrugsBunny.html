				This is unfortunate, but sometimes it&#039;s all that can be done; it&#039;s impossible to verify everything&nbsp; And it seems like some vendors have gamed the system and given themselves many fake positive reviews.&nbsp; But overall SR tech support is doing a pretty good job, when you consider everything they have to deal with.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they&#039;re totally hands-off; they actively support the site and users as best they can.<br /><br />The best way is to order a small order from a vendor the first time, and if it&#039;s good, stick with them foreverâ€“don&#039;t jump around a lot.&nbsp; Once you find a quality vendor that treats you right, and you treat them right, you can have quality ongoing service and not have to worry about what you&#039;re getting, trying new unknown vendors, etc.&nbsp; Checking the forum reviews on vendors beforehand also helps when using a new vendor for the first time.

				Meh, buyers basically get fucked no matter what if the vendors rep is anything but horrendous.&nbsp; Read the whole profile page and mention that they violated whatever terms were found on the profile.&nbsp; Alot of vendors basically say that you are fucked in the case of a no-show or transaction gone sour lol.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take re-ships as a resolution. Just get your coins back and order from someone else. <br /><br />The staff has almost nothing to do with it, you can blame the fags that try to use SR as a meatcurtain and just keep making new buyer accounts to try and scam vendors/threaten ratings.&nbsp; I know that alot of vendors on here scam, but the amount of buyers trying to scam is much higher.&nbsp; Obviously, the staff is going to trust someone who paid them $500 over some schmuck that said that their $100 of personal goodies did not arrive.<br /><br />Good luck, if you ever order again! :D
