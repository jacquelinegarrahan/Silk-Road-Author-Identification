				Hey everyone.<br />I thought i would try and be more of a part of the community by starting up a discussion.<br />One thing i think all of us have in common is playing computer games.<br /><br />So, i wanted to ask what games people have played that simply blew their mind.<br /><br />It can be any era, any console or computer.<br /><br />So for instance if you played Manic Miner on the Spectrum or Mass Effect on the X-both, they both count.<br /><br />Well, look forward to the responses!

				World of Warcraft was my first drug, it&#039;s in kind of a sorry state now though, hopefully Mists of Pandaria fixes it. <br /><br />More fitting to the theme of these forums, I highly recommend Audiosurf. It&#039;s like 5 bucks and gives endless amounts of fun, possibly the greatest game in the world to play while high on anything. There is a new one coming out soon and you can sign up for the beta

				It&#039;s sort of like a mix between guitar hero and tetris. You take any song from your music collection and import it into the game, and then the game generates a track that syncs up to the song. During really intense parts of the song the track will dive down, there will be bumps whenever there is a heavy amount of bass etc. You &quot;ride&quot; down the track and try to match up the blocks that appear along it. Lots of trippy visuals going on in the background as well. It&#039;s basically a different experience based on what kind of song you are playing. It has a demo you can download, it&#039;s the full game but it kicks you off after you play like 5 songs

				Well I wouldn&#039;t say it blew my mind or anything, but I play League of Legends ALOT... Haha it&#039;s really addicting, it takes alot of strategy and knowledge of the game and it&#039;s characters.<br /><br />You have to pick from a big list of champions, and every one of them is unique but they all have certain abilities and whatnot. Then when you play, you&#039;re placed on a map that has 1 Nexus at each end (that&#039;s your &quot;power source&quot; or whatever), several Inhibitors (smaller versions of the Nexus) and several Turrets (turrets help defend the nexus and the inhibitors, they stay in one place but they deal damage to enemies if they come too close). Basically the goal is to destroy the other team&#039;s nexus by destroying their turrets to get inside their base. You&#039;re on a team of either 3 versus 3 or 5 versus 5 and each team has an equal army of Minions(little guys that run around and deal damage to enemies but are not played by a human) to help you win. You have to stay behind your minions so they will take the damage from turret hits while you destroy the turrets. You also earn gold during the game by killing enemies and whatever, and you can buy things during the game that enhance certain abilities, so you have to know what kind of abilities your champion has and how you should build them.<br /><br />I dunno, I like it alot because you don&#039;t have to dedicate a /ton/ of time to it or anything. I mean each game lasts about 30 minutes to 1 hour, and then you&#039;re done, there&#039;s no quests or anything time consuming like that really lol.. It does get kind of boring after a while, but I don&#039;t have alot of time to play anyway, so I like it.

				That is a very strange coincidence!<br />Currently me and a friend are having it out on Starcraft 2.&nbsp; We were literally shocked when we tried online against other players though.&nbsp; Got our asses kicked big time.<br />Battlefield 3 is both awesome and very realistic.&nbsp; I cannot remember the name of the particular mission, but it is set at night time with the use of night vision.&nbsp; It is probably one of the first few levels.<br />But honestly you make your way up this hill then you see all the lights streak across the sky.<br />Really, it feels like you are actually in Afghanistan!

				I used to be into WoW but it ate up all my time grinding. I&#039;ve been into Elder Scrolls for 3 generations. I really like the single player aspect, and the option to do whatever the fuck you want. It seems like there are endless adventures. Not to mention all the mods you can get. Quality shit. I like the DnD style games too, can&#039;t remember the names right off the bat. Oh yeah and Portal 2 was freakin awesome!

				In my video game hayday I was really good at counter strike source. A good round where I&#039;d kill 4 or five people felt like I was in my own action movie, like rambo and shit. I think I&#039;ve outgrown video games by now though.

				Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I &amp; II we&#039;re absolutely amazing games! I spent hours playing those two, and the best part is they never get old. :D<br /><br />I just started playing Final Fantasy VII and X again on the Playstation, they make me feel so nostalgic. Halo is always fun to play at LAN parties, which is something everyone should experience once in their life I think.

				Limitless, Metal Gear Solid was absolutely awesome mate.<br />Do you recall a game called Tenchu- Stealth Assassin?<br />Basically you were a ninja that could sneak up behind people and slit their throats etc.<br />Plus you used a grappling hook to scale roof tops and sneak around people.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was even a &quot;spidey sense&quot; meter that let you know how close an opponent was to spotting you!<br />Wow, all of this was done in the 90s too.<br />Was probably the idea behind Metal Gear Solid.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hear what you say about watching tv.&nbsp; When i stopped gaming i went through DVD box sets like a squirrel with nuts.<br /><br />Favourites so far are Fringe, Dexter, The unit, among others.<br />Plus watching the big bang theory is an absolute must.

				I&#039;ve played probably 90% of the games you could list, for PC that is. The only one that truly blew my mind was Everquest back in 1998/99, there was nothing else quite like it so it was incredible back then. Probably spent the most game time between that and Counter Strike (1.6 &amp; Source).<br /><br />Neocron was probably the game I had the absolute most fun with.

				All the Final Fantasy talk and no mention of Final Fantasy Tactics? That game was awsome, as was the original SNES/PSX version of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together

				Sadly i only tried Halo 3.&nbsp; Then realized it was a storyline based game so i didnt know what the fuck was going on.<br />As for Diablo.&nbsp; Absolutely loved the first game but didnt get around to trying the sequel.<br />From what I hear they are planning a WoW version based on the world of Diablo 3,<br />Can anyone confirm this?

				My list of favorite games:<br /><br />--MMO&#039;s--<br />Everquest<br />Neocron<br />(I&#039;ve played WoW, Vanguard, AC2, EVE, &amp; RIFT among others but they were all subpar in my eyes, the 2 above were innovative for their time)<br /><br />--Strategy--<br />Total War Series (Rome is my favorite, followed closely by Medieval II)<br />Civilization IV<br />Age of Empires II (The gamers back then were divided between the AOE2 players and the StarCraft players, great days for tournys)<br /><br />--RPG--<br />Morrowind<br />Oblivion<br />Skyrim (Those 3 in that order, I didn&#039;t think Skyrim was all that great compared to the rest of the series. The fact is, the Elder Scroll series have always been 250% better from mods and the fact they waited so long to release the limited tools for Skyrim was a HUGE let down)<br />Mount &amp; Blade (Quite innovative sandbox combat)<br />Baldur&#039;s Gate 1 &amp; 2 (What a storyline)<br />Final Fantasy Tactics (Still play it on an emulator)<br />Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together (Still play it on an emulator)<br /><br />--FPS--<br />Operation Flashpoint (MFCTI/CRCTI mods made this the greatest FPS game EVER FUCKING MADE!! Without one of those mods, it&#039;s subpar)<br />Counter Strike (Always was and still is the ultimate competitive FPS)<br />Delta Force 2 (Lovedddd me some DF2)<br /><br />--Sports--<br />Football Manager (So..Addicting)<br />FIFA (The best 2 player game for stoners)<br />Madden (Back when they were innovative and gave a shit)

				Speaking of the X-Box, if you want a really good time waster then you have to get Space Marine.<br />Its a hack and slash based on the Warhammer 40,000 universe.<br />Personally took me less than a week to finish but it also boasts a very addictive online battle mode.<br />Recommend this to anyone who likes games you can just pick up and play.

There were some issues on some release day, but since then I&#039;ve tried to play as much Diablo as possible, just got offline after a 5 hour play. There are some things changed, but it is pretty much the same as Dia2, Act1,2,3,4 Diablo at the end and boom nightmare then hell and then inferno. <br />What I love the most about it is the way they made the boss fights, you need a strategy for every boss pretty much. Gets really tough from nightmare onwards. Also crafting jewels, and blacksmithing. There is to much to mention, only problem for me is it gets very repetitive and lower drop rates at higher stages so a lot of farming.

				At Meister.<br />Rome Total War was absolutely fantastic.&nbsp; Did quite a few all-nighters on that game.&nbsp; What was your favorite &quot;tribe&quot; to play as?<br />I mean being the romans is Kick-ass but the Egyptians were just all might and power.&nbsp; Very fun to play.<br />Didn&#039;t try any other Total War games in the series.&nbsp; What one would be worth playing speaking in terms of graphics?&nbsp; Quite an old series.<br />As for Diablo i played the first one back in the 90s.&nbsp; If i recall it was a bit glitched.<br />Definitely will get Diablo 3, cant wait to try it.
