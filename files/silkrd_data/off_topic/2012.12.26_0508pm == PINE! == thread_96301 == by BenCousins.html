She certainly knew a lot about everything that was being discussed here on the Forum where as most people may be knowledgeable on a couple of topics and only know a little about a host of others. What ever the case may be, her presence in the community was perceived as a &quot;genius&quot; by most of us. Whether she achieved this single handedly or with the help of others working behind the scenes as part of a team, remains to be seen. At the very least, Pine&#039;s sudden disappearance from the Forum where she had invested a huge amount of time and effort is bizarre and raises a lot of questions which may never be answered. I personally am not swayed either way at the moment and have no idea on what the true story is, but to invest so much here and then just vanish into thin air definitely has me thinking. :-\

				I wonder if someone who had been a member as dedicated as pine, that pine now owns and operates a operation of networked drug trade, thus would not want to continue to risk posting on the forums in the same energetic&nbsp; fashion as before. Switching users would be fast and easy as fuck. drugs are known to change peoples outlook on something incredibly fast.... who the hell knows. Mr &quot;skeptical sketchball without witness&quot; seems to say he was LE and that could easily be true too. If they seemed to know everything about every subject, they may have been people whos job was to research any issue someone needed and post on the information needed. Who knows what kind of tactics they would use on these easy and free forums? Im sure they are trying all sorts of weird shit. I would not be surprised if LE techies were some of the scammers, interested in scoring a few extra bucks on the side of the job.<br /><br />Im just trying to think outside the box!

She started that PGP Club and a couple other things. Not sure where she gained her education (was wearing a college mortar-board on her you tube vids) but she helped a lot of newbs on SR with security and not getting caught on Tor, frequently contributed on Security and Philosophy, Economic and Law sections. Sounded like she studied International Politics (use of terms and selection of knowledge). If SR was compromised (didn&#039;t say it was, didn&#039;t say it wasn&#039;t, didn&#039;t say anything), she&#039;d be the first one to pick up on it, and suggest how to solve it. She wrote a staggering amount of material on teaching us to think independently, and be aware of our environment; not to do stupid things. She&#039;s not the type to take a break or just up and go for no reason, so obviously a bit of a concern. Last logged over a month from memory. Don&#039;t know why but only the really bad things that usually happen to really good people are the only things that come to mind.<br /><br />My thoughts…..<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31665.msg677052#msg677052">Quote from: Razorspyne on December 22, 2012, 08:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31665.msg676912#msg676912">Quote from: Bungee54 on December 22, 2012, 07:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31665.msg676859#msg676859">Quote from: Razorspyne on December 22, 2012, 06:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31665.msg673470#msg673470">Quote from: abby25 on December 21, 2012, 12:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">......The reviews on this thread seem to be a bit few and far between for some reason......<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then this will seem even more random.

I&#039;ve been doing pine recently, and the more I read the more I appreciate how much she knew. Her posts are gold for tech-heads.

I hope it had nothing to do with LEs; it certainly appears from her posts that she could have been a significant threat to them, and a virtual avatar for Silk Road. I don&#039;t know anything about it other than she disappeared in mid November with the blackouts, that the account was modified early December to remit her sex, and then accessed again on 18 December by someone who was obviously not her, and I don&#039;t think it was her mom.<br /><br />Tell me I&#039;m wrong. Read her posts and tell me she wouldn&#039;t have been a priority. I&#039;m just amazed, and quite frankly a bit embarrassed, that no one on SR (except pine) has thought of even returning the slinging. I&#039;m sure there must be SOME hackers here. I&#039;m having to tread very carefully now nomad bloodbath is back as I don&#039;t want my posts deleted again (not necessarily bloodbath though, perhaps the OP did it), and I don&#039;t know what his thoughts are regarding returning the favour in regards to LE, but we are being attacked left, right and centre by them via virtual accounts, spamming, quickbuy hacks, image hacks, and god knows what else and nobody seems to give a damn. I won&#039;t hire a hacker so don&#039;t PM me for soliciting if you are, but if I was I sure as shit wouldn&#039;t be turning the other cheek.<br /><br />Anyway, didn&#039;t mean to write this much.

				Great minds indeed think alike. :)<br /><br />And that&#039;s an interesting observation about the login, but you may be attributing more to it than it deserves. I tend to be anti-conspiracy theory. The world is more mundane than our imaginations like to admit, and our imaginations run wild in an information vacuum. The de-modding fiasco is a good example. Lots of conspiracy theories, but if nomad&#039;s account is true, the explanation is relatively mundane and still makes a lot of sense in light of the circumstances.<br /><br />In the simplest view, Pine got scared and/or upset with the forum, like a lot of people did in November, and quit, but she came back once to check on her account.

This might have been a punctuation convention at one point, but it ain&#039;t now. I don&#039;t remember ever seeing her do anything like that but if she did- well done by the imposter!<br /><br />DPR has had a few quirky things in his posts: &quot;The die have [sic] been cast,&quot; a couple of minor but consistent grammatical errors that I can&#039;t remember, etc. I know at least once he said he&#039;d revised a post (by taking out the swear words, I think) in an attempt to make his writing less distinctive. But the more you write, the more you inevitably reveal certain habits and preferences (the majority of which won&#039;t even be errors, per se) that can then be compared to other stuff you might have written. I believe that&#039;s how they tracked down the Unabomber- his brother recognized the distinctive writing style.<br /><br />So I&#039;m saying we probably shouldn&#039;t strongarm the New York Times into publishing DPR&#039;s manifesto.
