				intro:&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a light rec user of E and molly for about ten years. Thanks to the awesomeness that is SR, I&#039;ve had to good fortunate to get some &quot;pure&quot; mdma from NL and other places.&nbsp; However, as pure as the dutch molly claims to be, I don&#039;t get the same &quot;magic&quot; as I did from a street pill. <br /><br />I&#039;m aware of some reasons why, such as tolerance and such. On the flip, I don&#039;t get the horrible hangover either. The last time I had a good pill, it made my skin tingle and euphoria all over. My recent dutch mdma rolls were good, but not &quot;ecstasy&quot; amazing.<br /><br />hypothesis:&nbsp; With my limited knowledge, ideally, a good ecstasy pill contains mostly MDMA and some other side ingredients...maybe caffeine, K, mda...etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I assume a bad pill contains a bunch of shit powder.<br /><br />question:&nbsp; So now that I have &quot;pure&quot; mdma to cook with, what can I add to it to make a perfect Ecstasy cocktail?

				Personally, I like 20-30mg of (meth)amphetamine with my MDMA. Adds a bit of euphoria and gets you up and dancing.

MDA/MDMA rolls are supposed to be great though. I&#039;ve heard a bit of ketamine is good too but I don&#039;t mess with that stuff.

				pills and pure mdma are not the same thing, its an assumption that a lot of people make, that there is just mdma in a pill, there is almost always some other additives in there, as ive mentioned in another thread i find pure mdma quite sedating so many pills have an extra stimulant in them to take that sedating edge off it can be anything from simply caffeine to meth, thats the problem with pills in a way, youll probably never know what that magic combo was that they contained. also the prob with asking for suggestions is that only you know that particular magic youre looking for, if its up and dancing youre after look towards stims, maybe some speed, personally though i like it a bit more trippy so id be throwing a 2c in there although ive not tried MDA yet

				thanks @towelie for the heads-up. honestly didn&#039;t know it would involve so many specialty ingredients.<br /><br />@profspudhed - i agree, that everyone&#039;s &quot;magic&quot; is subjective. I like to just chill and sink into the couch feeling awesome.<br /><br />And a big no-thanks to meth, no offense. Just not something I&#039;d want to mess with.
