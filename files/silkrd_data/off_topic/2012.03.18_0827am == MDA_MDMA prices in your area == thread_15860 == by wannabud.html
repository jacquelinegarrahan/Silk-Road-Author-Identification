				Last year and the couple years before you could find good pure MDMA for 100$ a gram, 15$-20$ a cap(tenth)<br /><br />Now its been gone for awhile, cut shit is 60$-80$ a gram, 10$-15$ a cap..<br /><br />Now IF you can find pure crystals its like 120-130$ a gram, 20$-25$ a cap.<br /><br />Shits rediculous, but since i found SR im hoping i can spread the love an lower the price&nbsp; 8)

				The prices around this way are unreal- especially this time of year.&nbsp; You can get kids paying 120-140 a g of molli (normally its 90-100, but demand is very high right now) and&nbsp; 20-25 for a roll-&nbsp; Its easy to find cheaper and usually better stuff, but the kids in my part of town are complete idiots and love to spend the rents money

Now, I&#039;m the only person around that I&#039;ve heard that has it at all much less the real thing. It doesn&#039;t last long.

				usual street price for an E pill (combo of mdma/mda/mdea/amp/other rc etc.) $25-$35<br />mdma caps are $45 or more (usually cut with glucose or whatever)<br /><br />these are prices for someone at the bottom of the chain, mdma is hard to obtain unless you know the right people. <br /><br />Yep Australia&#039;s prices are inflated and it applies to nearly everything

				between $18-$25 USD per pill. Usually little to no mdma in it....usually piperazines, amphetamines, etc. I think it&#039;s been that way at least 5-6 years <br />Forget about a g on the street...but on the rare occasion it&#039;s $225/G<br /><br />You have a better chance of winning the lotto than finding quality mdma here, sadly.

				Prices in UK vary a lot.<br />£50/g ($80)where I am at the moment (thank god for SR), but a few years ago I lived in a southern port city where a gram of pure was £30/g, £35 if my dealer &quot;needed some taxi money&quot;.<br />Ketamine was also very cheap, with some of the best stuff I&#039;ve ever had for £15/g.<br />Never even saw MDA...
