				Hi again,<br />I wrote that last message in a mess. I&#039;d been drinking and taking vals as well as various opiates and speed.<br />I was being a complete idiot and I apologise. That is no way to behave and very dangerous.<br /><br />My father passed away recently and it was very sudden. Obviously I miss him intensely as I was very close but the duality<br />of my life really showed up and I wasn&#039;t liking what I saw.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to stop selling on here; I have too good a thing going, but please remember that unlike many on here there is just me<br />running my &#039;business&#039; and that occasionally my job and my social/love life get in the way. I decided last week that my love life comes first<br />and so if I take a day to accept an order, tough shit, I will accept it when I come on and I will post it as soon as possible. I have never not sent<br />a package and I go through a lot to keep things safe so I don&#039;t appreciate the aggro messages. If you have an addiction and are rattling then<br />PREPARE by keeping stuff for emergencies. It is not my job to keep you stocked, it is a service I offer.<br /><br />You will always get your packages, my feedback will attest, but I no longer have the patience for people who treat me like a supermarket<br />and are rude beyond belief when it is a day late.<br /><br />From now on I will be creating a blacklist of people who really have no respect. It will be hard to get on don&#039;t worry, a fair complaint won&#039;t do anything at all,<br />but abuse or downright incidious behaviour will earn a place. It is shared amongst 14 vendors so far but I hope to grow this as we go on if needed, though ideally it&#039;ll have no names!<br /><br /><br />Anyway, please be nice, we vendors are often just people too and things happen out of our cotrol.<br /><br />I hope you understand!<br />To 99.99% of members out there, you&#039;re the best and I thank you!<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />BL<br />

				I&#039;m not one of your customers but I&#039;d like to say good luck, I&#039;m terribly sorry for your loss, that is very very unfortunate :( Keep your head up and if you think you should put your love life ahead, go for it definitely! <br /><br />You cant help others before you can help yourself so I hope that you manage to recover soon and its good on you for informing others the reasons for your inactivity.<br />All the best ByronLegosi, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll go through it all right<br /><br />Kind Regards
