				So I hesitate to post this &#039;cause I know some people will find this amusing, but here goes.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried many different &quot;recreational chemicals&quot; in the past, and used to be a regular weed smoker.&nbsp; Used to... I stopped several years ago, probably because I moved on to other stuff. <br /><br />Anyway, one of the things I&#039;ve seen advertised is &quot;herbal incense,&quot; &quot;smoking blend,&quot; &quot;JWH-250,&quot; etc. <br /><br />What I want to know is how does this stuff compare to the real grown-in-the-dirt cannabis?&nbsp; Is the high the same, or is it just a piss-poor substitute?&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a little internet research and can&#039;t find a good answer, though I can find find loads of advertising and propaganda for the synthetic stuff. <br /><br />Experienced synthetic/cannabis smokers tell me how you compare the two.

				I&#039;m not sure about JWH-250, but i&#039;ve heard JWH-018 will get you feeling good.&nbsp; However, i&#039;ve also heard of people throwing up after they smoke it and some other bad stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;d stick with the natural herb.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying pot is healthy or anything, but the synthetic shit can fuck you up.

				Personally, I have tried a few of the synthetics and found them to be lacking. JWH-018 and JWH-250 especially give me extreme paranoia and a weird and uncomfortable headspace.<br /><br />It is all about personal preference though - some people swear by synthetic weed.

				Its a different chemical than weed,<br />This question is like asking Mushrooms vs. LSD.&nbsp; (this really works cause one is synthetic and one is &#039;natural&#039;)<br /><br />There will be &#039;weed snobs&#039; who will hate on the jdubs, and I&#039;ve met people who think weed is immoral (cause it&#039;s illegal) who have no problem with &#039;spice&#039;<br /><br />go try it. (responsibly) and report back what you like.<br /><br />I personally only like the spice stuff when real weed is not available, just feels weird.&nbsp; But that&#039;s me.

				Oh, and to answer your question. <br /><br />Those blends can get pretty damn good at imitating the real thing, but when the chemicals are tried separately they&#039;re &quot;like&quot; weed but quite different.

				Also jdubs are really short lasting.<br />Only like an hour, hour and a half.<br /><br />And I get tolerance if i smoke again same day.<br />might just be me... I seem to have a natural tolerance to certain pychedelics....<br /><br />I see listings for 1 g of mushrooms, But I know for a fact that I wouldn&#039;t even feel that little amount... no effects at all...<br />I need at least an eighth, usually more.&nbsp; Kinda sucks.&nbsp; Gets expensive.<br />

				I didn&#039;t want to post this since everyone else was saying it got them fucked up all night and othr crap, I had the same experience as you.

				i live in a place that just recently outlawed the sale of synthetic thc, spice. before it was outlawed, i came very close to trying it. i just couldn&#039;t bring myself to the point of desperation that would allow me to try it. i like the natural herb too much to think that some weird substitute would be the same. the reasoning in my head went as follows: hmm why don&#039;t i just grind up some pencils and smoke them, that will probably do the same thing as smoking spice.: a mind-set will help calm your cravings when your herb availability is absent.

				As someone who has never tried synthetic weed, something to do with a rare condition to rejecting cannabinoids(still researching this) I would say as an observation that synthetic is definitely a real alternative.<br /><br />I know and have heard of long term cannabis users loving synthetic and switching over to using more synthetic.<br />Synthetic is definitely potent shit. You can easily fuck up a dose. Half a g in a spliff(LOL) would be impossible from my observations. Even if one was extremely tolerant. 1st time users will almost always green out and liken it to their very first use of cannabis.<br /><br />Here in australia we have a huge mining sector and synthetic weed is a real alternative just for the fact that users would pass a piss test, whereas cannabis would get picked up sometimes even 2 weeks after use.&nbsp; As of now there still is not an on the spot test to pick up synthetic weed. There is only one lab here that can test for it. Its expensive and hard to test for, from what I have read. So it will continue to be an alternative to cannabis users in mining and other industries that have zero tolerance to drug use until at least an on the spot test is freely available <br /><br />I notice heavy users to be stoned stoned. Like cant even remember their name stoned:) So yeah..this is what I reckon as a non user so take it as you will<br /><br />Most misinformation is spread by cannabis dealers ;)

				Just to share my experiences with both. I am a long time pot smoker. For job reasons I decided to use research chems for some time. I used JWH-018 and JWH-210 on a pretty regular basis for about 6 months. I began noticing that my mouth and throat were very dry when I would use them. Then one day I began coughing/spitting up blood. I immediately quit using the research chems and started using the real deal again. Since the change back to pot I have had no issues. I can not guarantee that the JWH is what caused these effects but I will not be using them again to find out. If you can, stick to mother nature.

				I used to smoke weed every day then stopped for several years. I didn&#039;t do any drugs during this time. Toward the end of this sabbatical, I decided to try k2. The first time I smoked it, I got REALLY high for about an hour. I had the munchies and everything else that I remembered and loved about smoking weed. It was harsh but it did taste good. Later on I experimented and made my own jwh-018 blend and it was harsh and kinda tasted like dirt. It did get the job done, however. I will say that the real thing tastes better and keeps better. The high also lasts much longer. The synthetics are kinda like miracle whip. It ain&#039;t mayonnaise but is better than a dry sandwich. I have moved on to smoking the real thing again but if you can&#039;t smoke weed because of drug testing or whatever, the synthetic blends will get you through the day.

				There is a severe lack of representation from a spice smokers perspective.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s easy to OD on. Don&#039;t over-do it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t smoke straight chemical.<br /><br />Buy a nice blend and smoke a one hitter.<br /><br />It&#039;s great.

				As a prolific imbiber of all things cannabis, I would say that the main things I noticed about JWH-018 were:<br /><br />-Relatively rapid onset and comedown as compared to a similar amount of sticky icky.<br />-Drier smoke than cannabis.<br />-A stronger visual effect, i.e. perspective distortion (I already have hallucinatory eye issues when I am not on drugs, so I can tell&nbsp; :( )<br />-For me this stuff did the opposite of cannabis in terms of nausea. I get kind of nauseous with tobacco, and the JWH was similar to that, where as weed quiets my stomach down.<br />-A more &quot;segmented&quot; feeling. I was aware of my heart rate increasing, the visual distortion and other effects I normally associate with weed, but they seemed more piecemeal. <br /><br />As others have said already, it&#039;s &quot;similar&quot;, but it&#039;s definitely not the real thing.

				Whether it&#039;s synthetic, natural, or a synthetic creation of a natural, the substance is still the same. Simply because a substance is created &quot;by mother nature&quot; doesn&#039;t make it safe - if that was the case uranium wouldn&#039;t be radioactive.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you&#039;ve smoked cannabis before you&#039;ve already smoked possibly 200+ cannabinoids. I don&#039;t understand why some people view synthetic cannabinoids as so &quot;evil&quot; - every substance should be treated on its own merits.<br />&nbsp;<br />I recently was able to try the synthetic mix of Kronic&#039;s &quot;Black Label&quot;, and I have to say it increased my appetite more than any other cannabis/cannabinoid substance I&#039;ve ever had before, which would be AWESOME for people going through chemotherapy, such as my late father.<br />

				From reports I&#039;ve heard, (haven&#039;t tried personally yet) It seems to really come into it&#039;s own when&nbsp; sprayed onto some bud, It&#039;s very easy to overindulge and meet the fear from the pure substance especially when it comes to eyeballing doses, But I&#039;ve heard nothing but positive reports from those that have modestly added a little to their ganja, better than oral consumption, better than a herbal blend+JWH or straight up bud apparently <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t be surprised If dealers aren&#039;t already passing off some low/mid with a couple of cheeky sprays to buyers that aren&#039;t so savvy<br /><br />

				back in the days when gritweed was prevalent and good green was hard to come bby id regularly grab a bag of &quot;spice&quot; from the local headshop back when it was legal, but generally only if good herb wasnt about, that stuff was largely jwh-018 based and rumoured (although unlikely) to have also contained hu-210 but in any case it did get you stoned, a heavy body stone but a little different than proper weed, ubt you can also just get the pure chem, careful though, its powerful stuff, a gram will last a long time even with an astronomical cannabinoid tolerance like mine<br /><br />oh and if you havent had it before it probably will blow your face off however some of the jwh chems are attributed to causing panic attacks and one i read about apparantly has such a strong binding affinity fot the cb1 and cb2 receptors it basically blocks them until they are renewed you cant get stoned again, but my biochemistry is far from decent so i may have interpreted it wrong or the guy who wrote it could have been talking utter bollocks for all i know<br /><br />oh and as for adding it to bud when i got my first gram of jwh-018 we had no green but loads of leaf and trim so we made a spliff out of that and i sprinkled in the jwh, probably a little much it seemed, we smoked it, it got is very very baked, then the entire bottom half of my body started juddering, i just pointed at it and said &quot;look at that, i cant stop it, its mental&quot; and laughed my ass off, it was all a bit odd, i think that was the limit for me and for anyone who wasnt as seasoned as i with the green may well have been in a bad way, ive seen more than one person have a freak out on synthetics, theyre a fine alternative if nothing else is available but youre on sr, may as well buy the real deal
