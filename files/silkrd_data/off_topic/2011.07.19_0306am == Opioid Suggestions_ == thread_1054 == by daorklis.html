				Hi, I&#039;m a pain sufferer who has been taking Ratio-Oxycocet 5/325 for almost a year now, about 4 times a day. My pain sucks and these definitely do the job but I&#039;ve noticing my tolerance levels are getting higher. Also, taking 2 at a time never really did much for me beyond taking my pain away, in terms of getting high. Anyway, I&#039;m looking to try something new and much stronger, not to replace my prescriptions, but merely for casual enjoyment while helping me deal with my pain. I&#039;m okay with bumping stuff to get the most bang for my buck but I&#039;m not looking to shoot anything. Any suggestions? My choices seem rather limited (since I&#039;m in NA) but I&#039;m in no rush so I&#039;m willing to wait around for something to be put up if none of the suggestions are available now.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;d like to hear some proven methods on the best way to deal with constipation. I fucking hate it. Anything would be helpful.<br /><br />P.S. daorklis... silkroad backwards in case you didn&#039;t catch that.

				Envious is right...sadly.&nbsp; Worst, IMO, is methadone.&nbsp; After five days of &#039;no go&#039;&nbsp; ER visits, usually a bottle of golitely, or some of that horrid tasting green slime they sell OTC in drug stores, I forget it&#039;s name.&nbsp; <br /><br />Normally, tho, drink lots of water, get some docusate, keep miralax around, suppositories.&nbsp; You really want a good site for this, and other problems associated with longterm opiate use, I suggest opiophile.org.&nbsp; Great site.&nbsp; The only real problem of longterm opiate usage.&nbsp; Grim subject tho...

				I think he was talking about what OTHER opioides can he take (ie, something stronger than the oxycocet)? If thats the case, you may want to look at the following chart (dont use tor to view or they will ban/suspend your account/i.p address):<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_comparison<br /><br />Depending on which drug you actually have will show you where you need to go on the chart (oxycocet can be a number of drug combinations). But if you want more bang for the buck try roxicodone - it has very little/none apap and they are HIGHLY abused, so they are WIDELY available and they are pretty cheap depending on where you live (in Florida 15mg = ~$6, Tennessee 15mg = ~$10). If you are switching from oxycocet, i would take a half of a 15mg just to see what it does - these can be pretty strong - dont want anyone hugging the porcelain throne :)

				I didn&#039;t think so but today talked to the doc and he said it was started July 1st, now he could be incorrect the only reason I say this is because I have Florida pain law&#039;s RSS&#039;d and that would be big news.&nbsp; He did say the pharmacies are the ones who notifiy him and he HAS to call the DEA before even discharging the patient so maybe I missed it, I know a law already in effect allows them to get the roster from a doc office without any court order.&nbsp; Catch you as a patient at one clinic then another in same month, you got problems.&nbsp; Also the new limit is confirmed(DEA according to my doc has actually specified what over prescribing is):<br /><br />Non terminal cancer patient: 168&nbsp; or 6 a day(180 but if 28 day visit, which all are subtract 12, so in reality limit is 168)&nbsp; Oxycodone 30mg IR or equiv<br /><br />Terminal Cancer patient: 240/224<br /><br />Leg cut off recently :240/224 but didn&#039;t ask for how&nbsp; long but it&#039;s temporary.<br /><br />There were mentions of other IR meds but I didnt want to seem to interested, Its got to be online I&#039;ll google &quot;168 oxycodone IR 28 day visit DEA over prescribing&quot; and try to find a link to see if it&#039;s confirmed or not, hey docs are people to, it&#039;s not like he&#039;s incapable of being wrong.<br /><br />I stopped looking quickly to not look out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going for 2 years , had the same meds never pissed dirty/without meds, never missed an appointment, and I use words with the doc that let him know he is 100% safe with me. &quot;Quality of Life&quot; is a silver bullet but it&#039;s good to have others so you dont look like Jeffro with everything else you are saying.<br /><br />Um armed security gaurds I have not scene at clinics, pharmacies only 1 (The shithole in Deerfield that rapes on price for anyone in Broward).&nbsp; Last place with a Guaurd I saw that performed how you mentioned was also coincidentally in Deerfield and is probably the one you&#039;re caravans hit&nbsp; A real shithole, vomit in the bathrooms, guys with gold teeth sponsoring sceniors, fuckers from Kentucky and Tennessee in there getting in where they fit in, can&#039;t blame them though.&nbsp; Sad , the place was 1.75 per in house and visit was 200. No that I think of it I would bet money this a place you&#039;re people have been to.&nbsp; &nbsp;They got raided and their Doctor jailed, the owner is still there looking like a mafia used car sales man, and he&#039;s bad ass the guy really is cool as shit but the place is a shithole (never went ofcoarse to see a doc but brought people there to help them, didn&#039;t sponsor them just mean showed them where a compassionate doc was)<br /><br />Uh 3 day was in reference to the original law in Oct where in house scripts where they would give you a 3 day script only , you do still get the 28 day script on paper to walk away and I heard about places doing something that sounds clever,&nbsp; a sort of unofficial in house.&nbsp; You goto the clinic who has an agreement with a mom and pop. After you see the doc , if you choose they call the pharmacist who then brings scripts over in a car.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how they are going to combat getting robbed and maybe they&#039;ve stopped this, I heard this 4-5 months ago so not sure.<br /><br />I spend a considerable amount of time in Broward and all my people grew up there and are there, Im&nbsp; sure enough my knowledge is as current as anyone living there now to the point of where I would be willing to meet whoever is in Broward that can prove (by me filling) 30mg Oxycodone can be obtained for anything short of 4 at this moment or until Friday that I will pay 100 cash (to make it legal) to anyone able to be picked up, smoked out with the finest shit in South Florida (Cheddar Cheese, NEW CHEESE STRAIN) and taken to the pharm with me to witness them either turn me away or accept the scipt.<br /><br />We are talking 2-3 days when I need to fill another part of my script.&nbsp; This is completely legal on whoever wants to prove me wrong and is willing to do&#039;s end.&nbsp; I will be bearing the risk smoking with you, I could care less if you&#039;re a cop have fun with the 1 day in jail bust for weed.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a big bad wolf speech this would help me because it would save me 100+ every month, so it&#039;s something I&#039;d love to be proven wrong about.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hahaha I&#039;m sorry about that.&nbsp; Most bang for your buck if you enjoy that type of feeling but intensified would be 30mg oxycodone IR/roxycodone.&nbsp; You said taking 2 of the 5/325&#039;s (10mg of oxycodone) just takes the pain away but doesn&#039;t get you high, a 15mg would only be 50% and you want max bang for your buck.&nbsp; Realize that if you crush one it will be like taking 6 of your pills and combining that intensity with it hitting you in 30 seconds-1 minute.&nbsp; I promise you your tolerance will skyrocket.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take long for 1 a day to become 4-6. There is something particularly nasty about this particular medicine when it&#039;s purified like that.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to be a chipper doing lortabs or percs but it seems to make you an official user once you try that stuff, you jump up quick..&nbsp; You will love it. You will hate it.<br /><br />The answer is oxycodone IR 30mg, or and I say this only because I&#039;ve seen a dude in Canada listing them , it might be common in your country, the original formula oxycontin 40 or 80 mg, both seem to be about the same purity but that&#039;s off of eyeballing as a pose to weighing the pill weight vs active mg.&nbsp; If it&#039;s EASY to get the old formula, I wouldn&#039;t call them generic because in the us they switched and the brand name had to reformulate to continue selling while they were able to hand off the real/old type to another computer to license as a sort of generic.&nbsp; Now if you have a script written for brand in the us you will never get the old type but ones that say OP instead of OC on one side.&nbsp; It&#039;s interesting but I don&#039;t know if Canada did this.<br /><br />Long and short if the old type oxycontin is available marked OC on one side and you can fill it every month with no problem that would be another option.&nbsp; I seem to remember it being considerably more mg per mg than the IR(roxy) 30mg version but that was when the 30mg was relatively cheap so they may have gone up as well at the pharmacy.&nbsp; Purdue had some sort of assistance program I was JUST about to get on when they switched that allowed you to pay some crazy amount like 20-40 bucks or something and get it sent in the mail, I would look into this if the old prep is still available only,&nbsp; if you are wanting to sniff you will want the old type and if that is no longer sold by purdue it isn&#039;t worth doing.&nbsp; If it is the way it worked in the US was your doctor had to apply for you.&nbsp; You just printed out a form and brought it to them.<br /><br />If I were I&#039;d call a CVS or something where they will at least answer price questions and ask then do the math, I&#039;d bet even with price hikes the 30mg is the cheapest mg per mg of sniffable.&nbsp; I don&#039;t sniff medicine but my cousin sniffs and smokes it and told me it&#039;s also easier to prepare any type ingestion than the OC&#039;s are/were.<br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Excellent question Happytree.&nbsp; Have you ever been to a 12 step meeting?&nbsp; If so, was anyone high there?&nbsp; My experience is that they are divided about equally between people who *never* get high (good for them!) and people who all go together and get high as soon as the meeting is over.&nbsp; In the game of life, some people just want to get high.<br /><br />This thread reminds me of one of my favorite stories (this is a true story, maybe there&#039;s a youtube of it, I don&#039;t know): A reporter gets a chance to interview the Dalai Lama.&nbsp; The reporter is thrilled; it&#039;s hard to get that kind of interview.&nbsp; So he decides he&#039;s going to tell him a classic Dalai Lama joke, which is: the Dalai Lama walks into Pizza Hut and says &quot;can you make me one with everything?&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the interview the Dalai Lama turns to his advisor, they confer for a bit and then he looks at the reporter with that totally serene face he has and says &quot;what&#039;s a pizza?&quot;.&nbsp; (seriously, this is true, I saw it).<br /><br />The point being: the half of the 12 steppers who get high every week together feel much less guilty if they do it all together; especially after going to &quot;a meeting&quot;.&nbsp; The next level up from that is coming on a drug forum to get more opiates &quot;for pain&quot; even though you&#039;re already being treated by a doctor *with opiates* and going to NA meetings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t make any more sense than telling the Dalai Lama a Dalai Lama joke, does it?&nbsp; :D<br /><br />@Clay-yup, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ve hit that place.&nbsp; And you confirmed the other part they always told me: it was way cheaper for the in-house meds (and waaaay more overprescribed) than getting it filled outside.&nbsp; <br /><br />@daorklis-I hope you don&#039;t get upset if I had a little fun at your expense.&nbsp; You seem like a good sport.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; I&#039;ve been where you are.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought so many 3 packs of enemas at a CVS that the clerk thought I was a gay prostitute.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve chopped wood for hours just so I&#039;d throw my back out so badly that the pain was *unbearable* and then I could justify buying some oxy &quot;just to be able to walk standing straight up&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone to NA meetings so high that the people in front started salivating while I talked with that look in their eyes that told me they were gonna corner me to see if I had any 40&#039;s for them as soon as the meeting ended.&nbsp; I&#039;ve nodded off in the front row while the &quot;celebrity guest speaker&quot; was giving his big talk.&nbsp; The funniest one was Danny Trejo.&nbsp; I nodded off while he was talking and since he&#039;d spent 20 years in different prisons at that point he just came over and smacked me upside the head.&nbsp; He said &quot;son, why are you even here?&quot;.&nbsp; I just said &quot;umm...I&#039;m still on the first step?&quot;.&nbsp; He just shook his head.<br /><br />Life is like a box of chocolates...sometimes they just taste better with drugs...good luck with your journey.&nbsp; Sincerely.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />(I feel like I&#039;ve helped hijack this thread.&nbsp; That&#039;s bad etiquette.&nbsp; The title is &quot;Opiod Suggestions&quot;.&nbsp; My suggestion is that taking opiates leads to taking a lot more opiates.&nbsp; Every time.&nbsp; So might as well enjoy it.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to stop now.)<br />

				Ohhhhh JoeBlow2, I am very familiar with 12-step meetings. Attended both NA/AA for about 13 years on and off. In all that time, maybe twice did I see someone drunk at an AA meeting. In terms of NA, well, that is sort of known to be a half-assed program, as it were. So, while I was never witness to people going to get high after the meeting, I also never saw anyone high at meetings.&nbsp; But I guess there lies the possibility there were things much worse than I ever saw. I have no problem with people who want to get high, just think it would be odd to go to a meeting to claim to want to get clean, and then turn around that night and get high. What a waste of time!<br /><br />In terms of &quot;accepting hard core drugs&quot;, lol, that&#039;s funny! You must not have seen many of my posts. I am very accepting of hard-core drugs! I bet I&#039;ve done waaaaaaaaaay more than you! Neener neener neener. lol

				Agreed: it&#039;s pretty hard to get the ball rolling, unless your original md is sympathetic and &#039;generous&#039; anyway.&nbsp; And of course, if you *do* get a good doc, you hate to leave them.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve tried every which way, but the DEA has just totally intimidated doctors and pharmacies, and now with even Florida under the puritan&#039;s microscope, that too is getting dicey.&nbsp; All they&#039;ve really done, the obvious, is turn a whole bunch of us into criminals.&nbsp; How many generations of this crap have to happen before they realize it&#039;s not working.&nbsp; There&#039;s just not enough money in it much longer, for pain clinics to be able to afford the legal protection, and of course, the less of them there are, the more they stick out...and all the busts of kind doctors, like what happened all over north florida mean that docs just don&#039;t want to prescribe opiates, I don&#039;t care what your problem is...they don&#039;t want to take the chance.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So normal middle class kids, out of desperation will turn to heroin, and, well, it&#039;s a long hard road...often ending--at best--with methadone maintenance, and that&#039;s another crappy road to go down...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1054.msg8595#msg8595">Quote from: happytree on July 20, 2011, 11:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://webmdpain.com/<br /><br />http://www.gwhospital.com/Hospital-Services-O-Z/Pain-Management<br /><br />http://washingtonpaincenter.com/<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak on behalf of any of them, however. lol<br /><br />If your doc won&#039;t do more than give you cortisone (which I suspect is what he&#039;s needling into your back), you won&#039;t get much more from a pain management clinic.
