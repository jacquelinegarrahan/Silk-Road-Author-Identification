				Only thing about Breaking Bad is that in the episode where he moves from making it with Pseudo-Ephedrine to performing the synthesis by making P2NP and then reducing it and then isolating the D-Isomer the amount he&#039;s paying for the lab set-up is bullshit lol, doesn&#039;t cost anywhere near $8K to produce 2 pounds of Crystal. Good story though. :)

				I love it. I hope he is representative of real DEA because he is so slow to catch on. I think Hank will shoot himself in the head. Then Holly&#039;s going to drown in the pool and Walt will murder Skyler because of it.&nbsp; Those are just some crazy theories floating around but I bet one of those 3 will happen.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t watched one episode of this yet, thankfully I don&#039;t have any TV reception, would you say this series is worth downloading to watch later? I do enjoy Methamphetamine and it&#039;s synthesis and a TV series based on this sounds great, how much lovey-dovey relationship crap is there in it? That can spoil a good series in my opinion...

The Wire is second because I like how realistic it is. Boardwalk is a trip through History and Breaking Bad is last because I&#039;ve only just got into it. <br /><br />And I&#039;d like to clear something up, Tony Soprano DID NOT die in the last episode when it fades to black. If His mother, his Uncle Jnr, some black guys, Ralph and Phil couldn&#039;t kill him then some no-name character in the final scene couldn&#039;t have done it either. He&#039;s too much of a god for that shit.<br /><br />Plus you can&#039;t die to Midnight Train, it&#039;s impossible to die in TV and films to that song. Fuck you all.

				Ali G is fucking one smart MF!!!!&nbsp; His Brit interviews are classic!!&nbsp; The Brits are so damn polite, the keep answering his questions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Funny thing is, Ali ask the deepest, and most social correct questions. He just ask them in a way that most people do not get the social issues he is tackling.<br /><br />US interviews.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seen them just walk away like he is a moron.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Classic stuff...not to knock my countrymen, but you got to have some wit, and intelligence to get all the underlining meanings!!!!&nbsp; Brits got good wit!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty water down over here!!!

That&#039;s all there is to it man. You can&#039;t go through 6 EPIC seasons of one of the best story lines ever created just and end on Journey&#039;s - Don&#039;t Stop Believing (clearly this was subliminal implicating the Tony wouldn&#039;t die and now that Phil died he would go on to dominate the Brooklyn and NJ). I mean come the fuck on. On top of that he was with his family and he just wouldn&#039;t have died in front of them BECAUSE if you watch the end scene closely he clearly clocked the prick in the suspect purple jacket anyway. Seriously just go watch it and listen to that song. If not then fuck you.
