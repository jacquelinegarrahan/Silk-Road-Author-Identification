				I mailed some cash priority on 6/6 and it has gone MIA, first time this has happened. When ordering I noticed their mailing address had changed, so I had sent to the new address. I am afraid something bad has probably happened.

				i also mailed it out on the 6th...damn that sucks. have you contacted them at all? i&#039;m ok being patient if it will eventually go through which is why i was asking here to see what was typical before contacting them directly.&nbsp; if you are saying you have done this before and not waited so long that concerns me...

				just wanted to say that i did receive my coins so if you are still waiting there is hope! took about 9 days total (7 business) for my cash in the mail in case any person stumbles across this post later &amp; wondering if they are being scammed or should use the service. so now that i know approx how long it should take i would say i have no problems with doing it this way as long as you dont need them instantly.
