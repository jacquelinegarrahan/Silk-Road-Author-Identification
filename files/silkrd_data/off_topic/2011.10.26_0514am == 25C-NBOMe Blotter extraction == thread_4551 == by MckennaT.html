				I have a sample of 25C-NBOMe 2x500ug blotter coming in a day or so and from what i&#039;ve read the best form of use is insufflation. Ive read about a few people talking about doing this on other forums but never found out if it worked or not. Here is the extraction process that I found:<br />1. soak your blotter in a reasonable amount of ethanol. <br />2. after some stirring for about 5 minutes remove the ethanol and save it. <br />3. Add more ethanol to the blotter and do the same. <br />4.join both liquids and let evaporate thoroughly<br />5. add dH20 and convert into a salt (see above). The amount of dH2O should not be too large, just enough for you to insuflate. and thus use the appropriate amount and dilution of HCl.<br /><br />Ive never tried doing a process like this before and was just wondering if anyone had any input on this topic.<br /><br />Has anyone took it via both insufflation and sublingual? Which is better?

				I haven&#039;t tried intranasal, but from what I&#039;ve read around the place, buccal has 50% absorbtion whilst intranasal has like 80-95% absorbtion. It will most likely be the difference between a nice trip and a crazy trip at 1000ug.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done the 2x500ug tabs buccaly and it will take you to a nice place.. intranasal of that same amount will take you somewhere near the edge of sanity most likely. Once you push the 25c past the visual stage to the headfuck stage, I find it starts getting unpleasent (just me though, you might like it)... so... the 2x500ug will be most enjoyable (1200ug buccal is amazing).<br /><br />The extraction seems a lot of effort to go to though.. for a single trip. There are sellers here offering pure 25c HCL powder which saves you BTC and time and effort... I read that same process somewhere before though.. check the big dandy 25c thread at bluelight if you get really stuck.<br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t help you with ideas for extraction, or 1st person comparison, but I&#039;m a crazy lover of the 25c and couldn&#039;t help but chime in for a moment.

				All input seems to still be good input. Only reason I would be doing the extraction is because I have a lot of free time and was looking to only have to use one tab for the trip but sounds like it&#039;ll be wiser to just take them the way there meant to be taken. I haven&#039;t had any personal experience with 25c though I have had my fun times with the 2c family mainly 2c-e. Just trying to get the most out of what I paid for :p

				I would think that your NBOMe is already a salt, probably HCl.&nbsp; I would agree that the best thing to do is order 25mg. That amount is too small and you will probably wind up wasting something there.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are dead set on doing it, I think the first thing you should find out is if NBOMe&#039;s are freely soluable in isopropyl alcohol, and if it is, get yourself some 99% IPA from somewhere like radio shack because that kind will be dry enough that you won&#039;t have to worry about excess water.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t bother with salt/base conversion.&nbsp; You always&nbsp; lose some product when you do that.<br /><br />Use 1-2 mL of 99% IPA, no more if it&#039;s freely soluable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pull all your IPA into a syringe.&nbsp; Get a large sheet of glass and lay out a lines worth of dextrose/powdered sugar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Squirt your IPA solution onto your sugar.&nbsp; warm the glass from the bottom with something warm to evap the alcohol.&nbsp; If the alcohol is not dry (water free) you will be left with a sticky mess.&nbsp; If its dry, you should have a line of NBOMe and sugar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Scrape up and chop with a razor blade.&nbsp; Snort.<br /><br />I&#039;d still say all this is a waste of time and your probably likely to waste more product trying to extract it than you would just going buccal.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;re just dealing with too small of an amount really.&nbsp; But there&#039;s an answer that is along the lines of what you had in mind.<br />

				Yeah, here&#039;s a quote from the Bluelight thread:<br /><br />Quote Originally Posted by Solipsis View Post<br />Today I dissolved 25C-NBOMe in isopropanol (IPA) at 1 mg/ml not for dosing purposes but storage and putting it on a carrier. I took 4 mg of 25C-NBOMe in 4 ml solvent and wet 800 mg of mannitol so that a dose of 300-500 ug will be 60-100 mg including the carrier - for insufflation.<br /><br />Someone suggested using creatine as a carrier in the same thread.&nbsp; &nbsp; Probably a better idea than mine (dextrose)
