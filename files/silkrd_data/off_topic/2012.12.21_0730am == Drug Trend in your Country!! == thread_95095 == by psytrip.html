				Hello fellow SR members, I was curious to know about the drug trends in different countries and regions, and in this thread everyone is free to share the drug trend in your country or specific region. If you don&#039;t want to name the country or region, that&#039;s not a problem, still you could name some substances widely used there&nbsp; ;) ;). <br /><br />I am in a country where nearly each and every substance is widely available, whether its pot, cocaine, heroin, pills, lsd, or anything that you want. Pot and some prescription drugs like codeine and some benzos, ketamine are widely available while lsd and cocaine are widely smuggled&nbsp; ;) ;) .. Here we have mountains for good pot smoking, beaches for enjoying cocaine and lsd and benzos are always taken for a comedown, so home for benzos is the perfect place. We have good rave parties here, nice hippy trend to follow in some areas and a lot of free time to do anything you could imagine with your favorite drug.<br /><br />I hope there is something different in your region?? I would love to know what&#039;s that and would love to visit the place to see the lifestyle you follow in your region with your favorite DRUG&nbsp; <br />:) :)<br /><br />Happy Drug buying on SR..<br /><br />

				I think people become too lazy to share, write on the forums after getting high. I become more creative after taking drugs, and everyone in my opinion should be. So do share on the forums. <br />And Happy Buying!!

				I live in a beach town and weed is absolutely the most widely used here. If you talk to anyone in the 16-50 age range, you can pretty much assume two things - they surf and they smoke. There&#039;s less the more inland you head, but there&#039;s still a ton of users. There are several dispensaries as well since I live in a state where it&#039;s medically legal.<br /><br />Besides that, meth and coke are two I&#039;ve been seeing a lot of in the past couple years. MDMA has exploded, mostly because of the new popularity of the EDM scene I&#039;m guessing.

At that time it wasn&#039;t even a taboo no one minded I&#039;ve seen people shooting up in school bathrooms. just after a few years it became taboo purity decreased ( I don&#039;t know why because opium production in afghanistan grew since Americans invaded and started controlling opium trade and sending it to Russia ). Interesting why there&#039;s no russian vendors here since heroin there is cheap and good quality, its easy to smuggle it in there because of big border. i actually was thinking of starting as a vendor and selling street quality strong dope cheap but not sure how to get bitcoins into cash and how much these exchanges cost.

Have you experienced it? Known anybody to do it? I&#039;m interested in seeing people who have first hand accounts of what that shit can do to people.<br /><br />As far as my area goes, there&#039;s a market for everything. Of course, it is the USA, so most kids are apt to try things once or twice... there&#039;s a pretty alright rave scene nearby, so MDxx compounds are pretty common, as well as a whole host of RC&#039;s. It pockets around where I live synthetic cannabanoids are SUPER popular, like everyone smokes them... usually it&#039;s in upper middle class yuppieish neighborhoods where you&#039;ve got suburban kids who have folks terrified of drugs that could drug test them at the drop of a hat. Weed is everywhere, and most people smoke it, but psychedelics in my community are kinda looked upon by the masses as just drugs to fry your brain, but they&#039;re pretty popular with kids around my age. <br /><br />At my college you&#039;ve got your standard pill-poppers, and everyone&#039;s always out to get an adderall or two. <br /><br />Meth is pretty popular in my neighborhood, but I don&#039;t know a lot of methheads so I don&#039;t know where exactly it is. I assume the same of heroin.
