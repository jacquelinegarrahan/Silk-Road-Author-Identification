				I&#039;m going to try to make this as brief as possible for various reasons. Places and dates have been changed to protect the innocent. I&#039;m a northern european citizen who immigrated to the US over 5 years ago. For reasons which I can&#039;t disclose and that you may or may not agree with, I&#039;d like to become a US citizen.<br /><br />The problem is this. In the application you are asked: &quot;Have you committed any crimes for which you have not been arrested?&quot; The answer that comes to mind&nbsp; to me unfortunately is: &quot;Yes. I purchase goods from SilkRoad, even though purchasing and mailing potential contraband across state lines is against US law&quot;.<br /><br />So I&#039;m inclined to answer the question with a no. However,&nbsp; after filing the application the applicant is investigated for almost a year to see what can be dug up. Lying on the application is punished by deportation.<br /><br />If they look at my expenses they will see that I have purchased bitcoins (I don&#039;t try to hide that) . I hoarded most of them, however some I sent to various tumblers before sending to SR. And that&#039;s where the problem lies. <br /><br />Since all BTC transactions are public, will the US Govt. investigators come to me and ask me to justify each and every bitcoin transaction? e.g: &quot;Who did you send this amount to?&quot; &quot;Why did you send this to a tumbler?&quot;.<br /><br />My question is what happens if tumblers are declared illegal retroactively? What if bitcoin is declared illegal by the US Gov? What do I do then.<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to think that I made a huge mistake using SR, and should have waited until I was a &#039;free&#039; US citizen.

				Amazing, why the fuck do you have to be so paranoid? Are you worth their investigation? NO, you are a nobody just like me and most of the users on SR.

				Well, id say lie lie lie and then lie some more. Just like it was justified to lie against the Nazi&#039;s in WW2 when they asked if you had Jews in your house I think its now also justified.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, if you dont lie on that application form you will never get citizenship.
