				I made a order from buy-jwh.com and apparently USPS tried to deliver it today, but they need a signature. They left one of those tan cards that say to go pick it up. I get mail all the time, this isn&#039;t anything new. Would it be safe to sign for it? I live in the US, and MXE is currently not under any ban, although it may count as a analogue for K or another illegal drug.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to lose 5g of MXE, would it be ok to just sign for it, or go down there to pick it up?<br /><br />Is there a possibility of being arrested even though its not illegal?<br /><br />Any help is greatly appreciated!

				It&#039;s not illegal unless they can prove you are going to consume it so I say go and pick it up.

A lot of the sites got fucked over by the DEA or something, whole thing just looked like one massive Risk-Assessment-Managers wet dream. Someone got 20 years or something. Try looking up terms about RC forums being taken down. I will try and dig out the threads for you.

				RC Vendors are usually walking a very fine line between legal and the Analog laws, making what they sell technically Schedule I. <br /><br />The DEA&#039;s been cracking down quite a bit lately. And because of it our streets are safer, and the unemployement rate is down!&nbsp; ::)

				Ok, I got it, and I tried some(~60mg). This shit feat weird. When I got the letter from buy-jwh the container said &quot;pentyl 1&quot; on it, now, I&#039;m also high from hash and 25i now, but I&#039;ve done these before, and there from a well known vendor. <br /><br />I already emailed the company asking what it could possibly be, if anything (my high ass overreacting...)<br /><br />Hopefully I just took a little MXE....

				1-pentyl is the beginning of the chemical name for jwh-018<br /><br /><br />probably just the company name designation in code or maybe they sent you a cannabinoid by accident. definitely not part of the chem name for mxe

				that is incredibly scary. fortunately for you, cannabinoid overdoses are relatively safe comparatively... <br /><br />RC mix ups from vendors were responsible for the deaths of multiple people, due to negligence... being sent bromo-dragonfly rather than 2c-b in one tragedy <br /><br />they are going to kill someone if they cant somehow figure out the simple task of reading an order and selecting the correct chemical to measure out! how hard is it to pay just the slightest amount of attention when you are dealing with peoples lives and health.
