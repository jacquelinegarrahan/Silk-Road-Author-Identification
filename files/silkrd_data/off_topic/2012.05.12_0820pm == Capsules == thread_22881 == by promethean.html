				Sadly RV&#039;s shipment hasn&#039;t arrived yet, I knew it was hopeful to expect it arrive in two days so it&#039;ll probably arrive Monday like they said. But anyway, I&#039;ve been looking around anyway locally and just got some (mdma) but they&#039;re in stacker 3 capsules (half purple/grey) and I looked it up they&#039;re like for energy/weight loss. I&#039;ve gotten Molly in clear capsules before but never in these kind. Do you think they are in these ones so its not so obvious what it really is? I gave a couple to a friend but he wants to drop when I drop with my other friend. But I won&#039;t be dropping for a few more hours. Does any of this make any sense? man, I swear I set out to say something and I just go on tangents or something.

				Can you twist open a capsule and see whats inside? Or even just cut one open and parachute the contents if they turn out to be mdma.

				yeah I was going to do open it up but shit gets everywhere because that&#039;s just how it works with me. I suppose I&#039;ll just wait when I actually drop though. No point in trying to open it up and just have it sit there for hours. Perhaps what&nbsp; I was asking if anyone has gotten it in capsules that are normally used for other things but in this case used to hold molly to be discrete.
