				Anyone know what this means when you call someone:<br /><br />&quot;At the subscribers request incoming calls have been stopped on this phone.&quot;<br /><br />Do you think my dealers dead or in jail? Man that really sucks... finally found a legit connect with insane prices and this happens. Phones been like that for about a few weeks no.

				Ya that&#039;s what I figured but thought I&#039;d ask..I&#039;m so bummed. Stuff I pay $20 for here on SR I was getting them for $3. Oh well...

				ghosts?<br /><br />I think he just took out the card from his phone put into another one and threw the old phone away. Only dealt with him once and he seemed like a real paranoid cat but then again he was dealing controlled substances in R/L which is a huge risk.

				I don&#039;t see why you would assume so. In any case, I&#039;d attempt to find a new dealer instead of hoping/waiting for this one to return, I understand how much it sucks to have good connections cut off.

				But that&#039;s the whole irony in all this...finding a new connect. You can&#039;t just go up to someone and be like hey dude you got some meth?<br /><br />I moved so I no longer have all my old connects. Used to be able to get pretty much everything...now ..not so much.

				It&#039;s something that could take quite an amount of effort. Dealers that you know IRL, depending on where you live, can have much better deals for certain substances than anywhere on SR, at the same time as being convenient. Unfortunately for me, MJ in the UK is utter crap, as are the UK vendors for it. Thanks to SR I&#039;m able to order from abroad. I don&#039;t know what kinds of things you bought from your dealer, but at the very least you do have the option of buying here provided it may be at a higher cost than what you are used to.

				Yep having options is always good.. I agree with the UK statement. I think the two worst places to live as a drug user would be Australia followed by UK a close second. I like opiates but just got into stims recently but paying $20 for one adderall pill on SR seems fing crazy too me which will be probably turn me to meth use and I can already see where that will lead me, lol.

				Haha, that sounds like a reasonable evaluation. Pills are definitely overpriced, I think it would take less effort to lie your way into a prescription of adderall. I&#039;m just going to stick with the green stuff. :P

				Yeah that sounds about right.. I was planning to do that in the future just too lazy to get into a doctors office and then there&#039;s always the fear of walking out with nothing, lol.
