				This can&#039;t be answered. It totally depends on where you are and there aren&#039;t many meth connoisseurs so it&#039;s hard to find super great shit even though 30% of users know their cook which is not common with many other drugs. Most of it up here is dirty unless you know one of the biker gangs that brings it down from Mexico. But they all act like G&#039;s and get busted quick flaunting cash. I have seen anywhere from 30-120 a gram. Most people buy teeners and points but I don&#039;t do it and don&#039;t know many that do so thats about all the info I can give you other than most people in the US take the easy way out and always use the shittiest most dangerous new way of cooking. LIke that &quot;new&quot; way of doing it in a soda bottle and shaking. Takes like a minute in a walmart stall and you&#039;ve got enough ice to get you and a buddy off or you could burn the shit out of yourself and expose some kid to this shit.
