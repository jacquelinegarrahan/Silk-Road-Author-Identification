				People often get caught up in debating whether the Jews constitute a religion or an ethnic group. Given the consensus that atheist Jews exist, surely &quot;an ethnic group&quot; is approximately the right answer, but a more astute answer would be &quot;a community of ruling elite&quot; or &quot;a tribal crime syndicate&quot; (depending on your perspective). The core of this group is not only extremely wealthy and well connected, but also aggressive, confident, and capable. As long as this core is able to retain its grip on the reins of the West, there will be material rewards to being able to claim Jewish kinship and the children of mixed-Jewish families will tend on average to identify as Jews. The tribe will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, though gradually becoming less purebred.

				What&#039;s the purpose of atheistic Judaism? I asked an atheistic Jew personally offline, and was not presented with any semblance of an answer.<br /><br />Why identify with a culture whose beliefs you don&#039;t uphold? It seems a bit pretentious, as if one is clinging to the whole &quot;God&#039;s chosen ones&quot; despite not believing in said God.<br /><br />I don&#039;t continue to identify as a Christian simply due to my parentage.

				Jews are Semites, as are Arabs, i really wouldn&#039;t consider them an ethic group on their own just because they were kicked out of where ever and have always been hated and never found a place of their own because they are inherently evil, zionist bastards, i cannot see a group of people who have supposedly had millions exterminated, go ahead and start exterminating the Palestinians and taking their land with the aid of the zionists bitch, the US, because it says the land is their god given right in some fucking book.

				Another incoherent rambling from an anti-jew. Your probably just repeating what you have heard or read. Whether you are a neo-nazi or not doesn&#039;t matter. I dislike the nasty viewpoints that people have about Jews way more than other racisms, because the jewish people have been the most oppressed people since the beginning of known civilization.
