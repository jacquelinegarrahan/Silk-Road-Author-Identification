				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Im new to SR and Im excited to get involved with the community. I heard about this place from a good friend who had some killer stuff a couple days ago and he told me were he got it. HERE.<br /><br />So, I figured I better give it a try. It seems legit from what I had check out so far.<br /><br />I have a couple questions.<br /><br />What is the preferred Bitcoin network around here?<br /><br />Have you ever got ripped off on SR?<br /><br />And finally, Why is LSD so expensive on SR? it seems many other drugs are close to street value but not acid!<br /><br />any tips or advise will be MUCH appreciated!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				There are a lot of choices as far as bitcoin exchanges go, I highly recommend doing cash deposits into mt. gox with bitinstant. The whole process usually takes less than an hour. Stay away from get-bitcoin.com, they seem to be a selective scam. Never access mt. gox from TOR because they will flag your account and you will lose whatever money is in it. <br /><br />My first dealing with SR ended with me being scammed, luckily only for 80 bucks. It was completely my fault and I had it coming, did something very stupid. Never go outside of the escrow system no matter what.<br /><br />No idea why LSD is so expensive, was wondering that myself actually.

				Instawallet works just fine for me, just be very careful and make sure you bookmark your link and write it down somewhere. And don&#039;t panic if when you try to send your coin to SR it says &quot;funds not confirmed yet&quot; or something of the sort, just give it a little while, usually no more than an hour or two and try again.
