				I&#039;ve heard 5-meo-dmt is more potent than DMT. Are the effects similar, or are they slightly different?

				they are two completely different experiences. as was stated, dmt is a very visual compound yet 5-meo basically completely void of visual activity. the feelings of each resemble one another in a way, especially given they are both tryptamines but strangely they are more dissimilar than anything. mainly 5-meo is like a blank peaceful, spiritual for some, void that is just possessed by like a presence and psychedelic mindset. but dmt is characterized by a very colorful active realm of many entities with a much stranger other worldly feeling to me. i dont really enjoy 5-meo for some reason idk, like it is too spiritual and almost not meant to be experienced or something, at least certainly not abused. produces a surreal experience certainly, but nn-dmt is more recreational in some ways.<br /><br />both are extremely potent and it is not like one produces stronger effects overall, just when compared mg to mg. dmt will certainly produce just as if not more intense and crazy a trip then 5-meo... it just takes a little more of the drug. starting doses with 5-meo are around less then ten mg if I remember correctly, but for dmt its around less than 50 mg. if you took equivalent dosages however, the experiences strength would certainly be similar potency if you understand what i mean. <br /><br />

I&#039;ve heard 5-MeO been referred to as the Power, and NN-DMT referred to as the glory. The vague difference between the two would be that NN is the far more visual, out of body experience, while MeO is the more introspective compound. Obviously they both go far, FAR deeper than that.

				That reminds me actually, if you are interested in DMT there is also a book I have read and would highly recommend to anyone wishing to experiment with such powerful molecules worthy of respect. The book is actually about a scientists clinical trials where the DEA actually granted permission to IV administer DMT to participants. The book discusses the background of the study and a great portion on DMT and the effects. Then the second half of the book is basically mostly just about the participants experiences and discussion of the implications of such a profound dug. Great to understand the molecule you are about to use and what to expect in some ways<br /><br />Called &quot;DMT: the Spirit Molecule&quot; by Dr. Rick Strassman <br /><br />Check it out!<br />- miR

				If your too lazy to read the book there is a documentary film for &quot;The Spirit Molecule&quot;. It&#039;s very informative with interviews from the scientists and test subjects in the DMT expirements and its got some trippy visuals too, Oh and Joe Rogan.

				anybody tried 5-MeO-DMT without aid of an MAOI orally? Above 30 mg it is supposed to be active? Is it? What are the effects? Thanks!
