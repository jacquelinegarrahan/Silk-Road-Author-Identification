				It&#039;s fucking hard, I just set goals for myself. Set a goal that I know I want 100% and I achieve it.<br />Just keep on pushing as hard as I can, it gets tough.<br /><br />Making sure I keep drugs as not a #1 priority, do other things first and when I have spare time, then do it.<br />Don&#039;t try and become habituated as whenever-you-can thing.

I add the work too, it&#039;s not fun like a roll from Molly but the feeling of being usefull is pretty good =) And I think work take you away from drugs on the week ( and everything that come with ) ... Without it I&#039;ll probably sell and take drugs for the rest of my life.

				Sorry to hear about your situation, Gtrmonkey. <br />Try taking a break from things, especially any drugs that leave you trashed for most of the day - assuming you haven&#039;t become dependent on them, in which case, don&#039;t stop cold turkey!! <br />Whether it&#039;s for a few weeks, or just a weekend, just don&#039;t use anything, and spend the weekend doing something new like hiking, bike riding, or even just sitting outside while reading a book. Turn your phone, computer, and tv off the whole time. <br /><br />I can&#039;t say I know what you&#039;re going through, but I have felt burned out - especially during my undergrad. My classes were becoming so intense, also working full time, and trying to maintain a &quot;social life&quot; as well. It was extremely overwhelming. I was taking so much adderall at the time that I literally felt like I couldn&#039;t get out of bed if I didn&#039;t have any. Though I did get into medical school, somehow..<br /><br />I hope this helps, if even a little. <br /><br />- sdesu

				You need some emotional attachment so friendships, families if your still talking&nbsp; :D and some romance always helps when you feel like you got nothing to look forward to apart from waiting for the 8-ball or that batch of MDMA you had to &#039;test&#039; (even though we know all the main sellers sell top drawer E)<br /><br />Drugs alone can help you through some bad times but they can create the bad times depending what drugs you use and how you use them.<br /><br />For example having an 8-ball and spending the weekend jerking off to computer porn is not as good as maybe sharing it with some nice women whose company is pleasant. Generally speaking anyone in a skirt is pleasant but watch out for Scots in kilts. they got dangly bits there. Each to their own of course.<br /><br />Try to take some long walks also.<br /><br />Fresh air.<br /><br />Work is good as it gives the balance in life. Work all week party all weekend.<br /><br />Take it easy also for a while. Most drugs like E, coke and speed and so on are best used every 2 months or so. Try some beer for a change. I like to have a drug free evening and just get drunk.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />Good luck brother or sister.<br /><br />

				was recently in your same spot (before silk road, not that sr has helped that at all), but i came up with 4 things I want to accomplish all with different time frames- run a triathalon, get published in a certain magazine, move to a certain large city, step my exploration/taggin up a notch (with lists of spots I must hit)&nbsp; I wake up every morning with an idea of how to get one step closer each day even if its small- one small step will eventually lead to big ass steps- I still wake up some mornings wondering what the hell im doing but u just fight till it makes a habit and you build from there.&nbsp; Also i just ordered some of MoonUnits DMT to top it off- hoping thatll give me a little insight.&nbsp; Also i know people probably wont like hearing this on here, but sometimes laying off the drugs for a minute lets your mind reset- at least it did for me, every so ofter i gotta quit weed for a couple months to reboot- it takes self control but at the end of the day its necessary~

				Lol Thanks for the advice everyone, But its not that I am addicted to drugs. Hahaha, I maybe try to trip once a month and get baked 3 time a week. Compared to what it used to be it, that was smokeing everyday, and buying anything I came across. But Lately just everything seem like I am stuck in a time warp, And I am scared to move foward. Then I lose interest in my goals. Maybe I do need a good LSD trip....., to help figure out what I really want out of life. And the setting Goals advice, is a good one, I am going to try that. I have goals, But when you break it down the way you did, They might be too large to start with. Or maybe I am just losing focus on them. But the main thing I want to stop though is the feeling I am boring others with talks about Drugs and what not. Hahaha, because quite franky, I get annoyed starting form the begining. hahaha.

				There&#039;s a misconception that people who do drugs only once a week have no problem whereas someone who uses them everyday has a problem.<br /><br />The fact is, some people get consumed by the anticipation of doing drugs, and the once a week user may spend the whole week thinking about the trip on the weekend. This could in fact be more of a problem than a moderate dose daily user, who is already high and doesn&#039;t spend their time worrying about the weekend, because they can enjoy their time in the present. Everyone is different, and of course many people do drugs occasionally with little thought about it before (at least no more than going to a concert for a band you love). Basically you need to watch out how much the thought of using the drug as well as the acute drug use is affecting you. I think that it is important to give this some thought, as I have quite a few friends who spend way too much time thinking about getting high next, even if they know the next time will be in 5 days. If this is your problem, a long break may be the only solution.<br /><br />
