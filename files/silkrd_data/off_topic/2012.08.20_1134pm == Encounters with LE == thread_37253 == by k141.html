				I think there should be a thread on people who have had encounters with LE as far as deliveries, knock and talks, phone calls, whatever. Comparing real-world stories amongst ourselves can help. Of course, take everything with a grain of salt because i&#039;m sure some bullshit will surface. <br /><br />I&#039;ll start. Local police visit, after orders from two different vendors. Everything came as normal, nothing out of the ordinary. Showed up days later after deliveries and searched the place. Drop said nothing, they found nothing, and left with no further contact. <br /><br />If you contribute, SHARE NO/AS LITTLE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. Make a new account if you&#039;re extra paranoid and don&#039;t want to tie anything to your previous posts. That should go without saying, anyhow.

				LE came with a search warrant or your drop consented to a search? I&#039;m a tad confused as there was no controlled delivery.

				Encounters with LE relating to SR? None as of yet. I did get pulled over once but I always keep packages in my trunk if I&#039;m even doing the deliveries myself. Basically the cop pulled me over for something else and I got a ticket and he was on his way none the wiser, just play it cool and don&#039;t act like you have a bunch of drugs in your car. <br /><br />I do have a LE story though regarding someone dropping off a package and the car was flagged for drug use so they got pulled over by DEA and got a warrant for the package (which took about an hour to get permission for), luckily the person was borrowing the car and the package was something they were selling on ebay not even drug related. Cops didn&#039;t even apologize they pretty much just said &quot;shit happens son, oh well.&quot;<br /><br />Pretty much if you only deal on SR and play it safe you&#039;ll be fine, it&#039;s dealing locally that gets you busted.

				I&#039;ve been lucky and have never had any LE encounters anywhere, except once I&#039;ve been pulled over once and got a warning lol. Although I did have a handle of whiskey (i was underage at the time) and my weed/pipe in my trunk. Got lucky I guess lol

				you&#039;d have to keep your &#039;encounter&#039; story pretty damn vague - as we all know the plod do read this forum, so if you get a knock and talk and fob them off then come here to talk about it, you&#039;re going to get another knock at the door ain&#039;t ya? and this time they&#039;ll have your story on paper

				I smoked loads of weed with LE before. Most of em are just regular ppl with a shitty job. You gotta be a bit crooked to survive though, so I guess raiding the evidence room is just a perk ;)

				ah right, gotcha - well no they wouldn&#039;t track where it was posted from, but if the story is that similar to their recollection of it they might put 2 + 2 together, especially if the initial bust/talk is SR related. it&#039;s not cast iron evidence, but it could warrant another visit which would put the guy under more pressure
