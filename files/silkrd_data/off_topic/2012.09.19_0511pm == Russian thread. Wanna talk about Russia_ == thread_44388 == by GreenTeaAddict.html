				Hi!<br />Bored? Here you can ask me anything about my country, life in it, etc.<br />Also I want to ask you: what do you think about russians? I think people outside my country think that we are vodka-drinking commie mafia bastards, selling oil and keeping nuclear bombs in the backyard. Am I right?<br />*sorry, my English is far from perfect*

				One of the guys I work with is on some dating site. He is in his mid forties and has a daughter and is always getting replies from young, hot Russian girls (I&#039;m in the UK, by the way). What&#039;s up with that?

				I&#039;ve got a question about modern Russian drug culture with respect to the enforcement of anti-drug laws. It&#039;s pretty common knowledge (as far as I know) that Russia is a very bribe-oriented place (correct me if I&#039;m wrong), how easy is it to get out of being arrested for something like smoking a joint or carrying a gram of weed on you? What are the &quot;expected&quot; bribe amounts if you&#039;re caught with some common drugs (ie. weed, mdma, coke, etc.)? Thanks in advance!

On one hand, sex is still a taboo. I mean, it&#039;s not normal for most parents to talk with kids about sex (sexual culture, girls/boys gender role, building a relationship, family planning, etc). There is a phrase &quot;there was no sex is USSR&quot;. So, parents still think that sex is &quot;dirty&quot;, and they kids are &quot;angels&quot;. <br />Meanwhile, &quot;angels&quot; grow up, and see sex everywhere. Mass media is literally full of sex in it&#039;s most dumb and primitive aspect. So, young girls learn how to communicate with boys from American Pie and Lady Gaga&#039;s clips. Instead of learning it from parents/school/books/etc.<br /><br />But the bright side is that dating sites are not representative. Girls on dating sites usually go there if they want to earn some material profits from guys with money. Sort of legalized prostitution. Not all russian girls are that bad.

I heard rumors that bribe amount starts from 150$ (for a cop that caught you with a joint) to 1000$+ to stop the investigation. It also depends on people you know (who can help you). And the price can be very different in small towns and in big cities like Moscow.

It says that in 2011 were 250000 of addicts in Russia. But since 01.06.2012 ingredients for krokodil are banned and now you can buy them only with prescription. So, cooking krokodil is not profitable anymore. And addicts won&#039;t live more than two years, so, few years later there will be no krokodil users anymore.<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s funny to read a russian word in english letters. Looks like we gave world a new word. Not a very good present, I think.

				I&#039;ve got a question: <br /><br />Do you think that most Russians know that Putin and his political system is a fraud ? I&#039;m asking because the public protests and demonstrations seem only to concern a minority. Also, how Putin uses the media to convey an image of super hero makes me think that there actually are Russians to believe it.&nbsp;

				Hallo from Finland! I like Russia, you seem like a really interesting culture. I have even considered moving there as I was offered a possibility to work there for a Finnish company. Never visited your country though, you seem too hardcore, especially when it comes to alcohol-consuming abilities...<br /><br />Is the neo-nazi problem really that bad in Russia? Like the movie Russia 88 etc...<br /><br />Speaking of movies, do you know the movies of the director Aleksej Balabanov (excuse the spelling)?
