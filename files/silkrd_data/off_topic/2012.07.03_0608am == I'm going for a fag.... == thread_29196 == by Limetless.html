We laughed our asses off for 5 minute; it probably would&#039;ve a 2-minuter if it wasn&#039;t for lucy.

				To the guy who made the post about food being dangerous. You are exactly right ANYTHING can be dangerous if it becomes a crutch or depend on it. <br /><br />I personally don&#039;t smoke puff either because it just completely spins me out and makes me feel paranoid and depressed. Stims don&#039;t do that with me but I think that is because I&#039;m more psychologically compatible with stimulants.

I can smoke a little now but if I had half a joint of a strong skunk I&#039;d be on the floor flailing around feeling like I had a whale sitting on my chest. I know its just panic so it doesn&#039;t scare me, its just a really shitty feeling. Tight chest, shortness of breath.<br /><br />Pretty sure the trigger for all this was a visit to Amsterdam, thinking the weed would be as it is back home I ordered a pot coffee, some kind of pot muffin and I bought a pre rolled joint and toked half of that. I spent the next 2 hours adopting the fetus position in a toilet cubicle with drool dripping down my face.<br /><br />Nowadays if I drop a Valium before I have a smoke I&#039;m totally fine, other than that I just use tiny amounts.

Just the smell of it is enough to relax me which is why I always have my grinder on hand, I&#039;ve had it for so long the smell is embedded in it. ;D It&#039;s like how a child carries around his blankie for comfort. I think the fact that my parents were always supportive of my use and I&#039;ve never had to worry about being arrested for it has just made it impossible for cannabis to give me paranoia. I&#039;ve smoked marijuana the first time for everything as well that it&#039;s just become a part of me psychologically. I smoked bud the first time I dropped acid. I smoked ganja the first time I rolled. I smoked reefer the first time I shroomed. It was my first &#039;drug&#039; and has been paired with everything after and it always will be. Even the first time I smoked DMT it was sandwiched between herb. :D<br /><br />Stimulants on the other hand make me feel like a sketched out tweeker. Unless it&#039;s a light dose, I get paranoid every time the same way you do with grass. I&#039;ve just figured this relates to my ADHD. I need drugs like psychedelics and pot to slow down my mind and chill, while stimulants only make it worse and I feel out of control and definitely not myself. Stereotypes probably play a small role in this too. Every old stoner I know is lazy and doesn&#039;t get much done other than smoke Mary Jane, but they&#039;re funny and have some great stories to tell. They&#039;re in no hurry and are generally at peace with themselves. Old tweekers I&#039;ve known on the other hand look strung out, old as fuck, and have barely any teeth left. They&#039;re quick-tempered, have the attention span of a goldfish, and look ready to keel over any minute. Now this is just from my experience based on where I&#039;ve lived and isn&#039;t necessarily true for wherever you&#039;re at, but it&#039;s hard to shake stereotypes once they&#039;re already made.

I&#039;ve tried working on stimulants and it nearly gives me a heart attack I work so hard, which is not good at all. I like to work at bakeries though so it&#039;s way more suited for chilling out and toking anyways. I&#039;ve had times where a few good lines of coke have made me god for a day though which is fun as hell. ;)

				Anyone ever seen a fight between 2 potheads? Its pretty fucking hilarious ^-^<br /><br />Shit it&#039;s called self control, and with it you can pretty much do almost any drug you choose without TOO much harm to your body...(obv depends on the drug and how much control you really have lol)<br /><br />althou in theory, I&#039;ve heard that 100% pure H has little to none adverse effects on the body (I&#039;m talking purely theory, no addiction, etc)
