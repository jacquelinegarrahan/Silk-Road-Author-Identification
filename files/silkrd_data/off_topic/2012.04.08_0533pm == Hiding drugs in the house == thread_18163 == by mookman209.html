				One good place is the curtain. Like in the part of the curtain with the hole that the curtain rod goes through, you know what I mean? They&#039;ll never find that shit.

				I&#039;m known to have abused drugs so I have to hide my shit very carefully. I move my hiding place regularly and I often hide in other parts of the house where suspicious people wouldn&#039;t think to look. I also seperate my drugs ie - I always hide my pot separate from other drugs because of the odor.

				I do know what your talking about with the curtains I have the rollup ones!! :) haha. I got the idea of making a pvc seal pipe or something like that and putting it in the ground close to the house behind like the fence of somewhere. I also have hid them inside a disk drive haha. Cut out a paper place sheet and hit the eject button and put them in and back in they go! haha. you can have it disconeccted too but you will need a paper clip to take them out AKA others wont be able to open it and find them. I used an old flashlight before too and just said it was out of batteries.

				I hide my drugs under the closet in the kitchhen on the upper floor. Other places I sometimes hide my drugs at are in either the DVD recorder,a DVD case,in my pillows,under the TV or and in shoes or clothes.

Unless there is a K-9 involved, I figure most cops just glance over a laptop in a carrying case with the power cords and an external mouse, etc.<br /><br />hiding in your house e/garage/yard is another story. But I think it is very important to split things up a bit - don&#039;t &quot;put all your eggs in one basket&quot; kinda thing.

				buy an urn, and fill it with camp fire ash.&nbsp; put it on display, on a mantle or shelf.&nbsp; double ziplock your stash, and push it down under the ash in the urn.&nbsp; even if cops bring in dogs, and they signal close to the urn, 99% of cops are not going to go digging through a family member&#039;s ashes.&nbsp; threaten to sue them if they disturb whoever&#039;s remains.&nbsp;

				dig a post hole in your garden, slide in an appropriate sized PVC pipe capped at one end, fill with whatever, cap the other end and carefully replace earth and grass over cap.<br /><br />If you want to be real cunning, drill diagonally under your neighbors property !<br /><br />Even ground radar will struggle to find that one !<br /><br />oh and dont forget to grind up all your weed stalks in your coffee grinder and regularly spread them around your garden so the dogs alert everywhere instead of one specific spot.. !

				-DVD cases<br />-Inside the Hem of a coat.&nbsp; Just make a small cut, slide the goods inside (better for smaller sized pills)<br />-Expansion bay of an old PS2<br />-Unused electrical wall plates, just unscrew them<br />-Above/inside insulation<br /><br />Electronics in general are good.&nbsp; Once the casing is unscrewed, there&#039;s usually a lot of empty space inside. depending on the item of course
