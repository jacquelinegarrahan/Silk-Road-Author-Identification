				I just moved into a new place and my neighbors and trying to both mug me and steal my car.&nbsp; I&#039;ve scarred them off 3 times now but they keep coming back.&nbsp; I&#039;ve called the police each time and even given them these guys address and the police just are doing anything.&nbsp; They openly try and intimidate me, I know they are planning on mugging me (I&#039;m a sneak and was eas dropping), they have tried to steal my car 3 times now.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to do now as they seem pretty serious and have real car jacking equip for getting right through locks and alarms and don&#039;t even care if I&#039;m watching them do it (had to bust out the 12 gauge).&nbsp; Anyone got any suggestions?&nbsp; The police won&#039;t do a thing so I need to do something myself to get rid of them fast before they kill or harm me.

				Google &#039;estate agents&#039;/ WOrk your way through the list. Take the hit. Next time do a little research first.Don&#039;t trust who you&#039;re buying from, they&#039;ll be as keen to get out as you are. Psychos don&#039;t change.

				Some one whom I know was thinking something more along the lines of blowing up all of the cars parked at the house (some whom I know has some under the table access to high explosions).&nbsp; Someone whom I know thought this might show them how deadly serious he is about them stopping.<br /><br />This is also a rental so it&#039;s not much of a hit but I have to stay in the area.

				Blowing up cars is a good way to go to jail and become unemployable. They&#039;&#039;&#039; (overclaim) on the insurance &#039;did you store that brand new wet suit in the boot?&#039; and three against one won&#039; show you&#039;re serious if this is the kind of guys I&#039;m thinkin of. Fancy eating through a straw for 3 months? The police don&#039;t care unti something haapens but theue&#039;ve proably been in and out of prison, badge of honour. How often have you had a proper kicking? Flats are cheao for a reason. Can&#039;t you stretch a little bit more or try find old school neighbourhood full of old people/ Not exactly the kind of place to pull but then neither is taking&nbsp; a bird back to yours for those three to call her every slut under the sun and you walk with bowrd heads up the steps/<br /><br />Don&#039;t they have a decent looking sister? Get in there and become part of the clan. Like Tom Hanks in Gren Mile. Or a million other mugs who ene up doing drug runs and getting 20 inside.<br /><br />If i was in your shoes (and obviously I&#039;m not) i&#039;d&nbsp; be scouring the &#039;for rent&#039; as I type/&nbsp; Can&#039;r you explain the siutation to your landlord, show him the police report, sujrely that could get you out of paying the rest. Maybe worth seeing&nbsp; a lawyer, maybe even get a bleeedin heart liberal do it for free, just snuffle and wipe your eyes from time to time, pu on some black eyeliner, compalin of lack of sleep, suffering at work, jumping at evey creak, etc//<br /><br />Good luck whatever you do, it&#039;s a shame there has to be such peoplee in thw world and a tragedy when three are under the same roof.

				Okay maybe blowing up their cars isn&#039;t the best of ideas but I was think it wouldn&#039;t leave much evidence behind.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taking a good kicking before and sure as hell can fight and am I deadly shot(going have my my CCW permit in another week or two and castle law is in my state so if they break in I can just shoot).&nbsp; If they put me in a self defense situation I know I can take them out.&nbsp; My main concern is my car really I can&#039;t all was be there to scare these shit heads off.&nbsp; About to drop it off at a safe house and get the alarm system replaced with a super expensive one and sue them for it at the very least.

				Get pretty CCTV systems now, hook up to your PC, take a photo 5 or seconds (or crap video) then wipe every week.. Don&#039;t know how admssile this would be in court and if these guys have friend...Maybe I&#039;ve been watching too much films but&nbsp; a squirt of gasoline througth the lettertbox at 3am a gun won&#039;t do you much good in the sef defence argument when you storn into their house to find them all in jim-jams&#039;s spread out on the couch.<br /><br />Your life mte, and you only get one, don&#039;t live it in fear, have as good a time as you can.<br /><br />2 options&nbsp; I can see are hope they&#039;re all mouth and move on to next target or move. Or try get some sort of backup go in there and beat the living crrap out of them (last one would be my &#039;fuck it, all is lost&#039; option)/ Who knows, maybe be able hire some muscle to help you, just hope thye&#039;re not connectedf.<br /><br />I really feel for you man. We should all be able to put our heads down, do qn honest days work for an honest days pay, relax at night without this bullshit in out lives.<br />Sounds as bad as my ex marriage/ Look on the bright side, you&#039;re not walking up feeling if your cock has been cut of during the night (hint hide the cuticile scissors). I got to the point where i had to say &#039;fuck it&#039; move away and go from seeing my sun every day to every second week. I was clean at the time (and still am apart from the odd dable) but I felt I had no choice. My had wasn&#039;t in the game. It was a real shit decisions, good job, son, family, nice house, but&nbsp; i bounced back. Don&#039;t know your siutaiont and don&#039;t want to but even the lowest of the low can bounce back with hard work (and the abibilty to ignore assholes who know nothing of your situation).<br /><br />I feel | should be hnding over a cheque for $150 about now.<br /><br />Thanks for the session.

				Sorry, I should clarify I meant shoot them when they break into my apartment not break into theirs and shoot them but good advice overall.<br /><br />I got a hd vid cam looking over my car now hooked up to my PC.<br /><br />Jumping them in the dark alley behind their house was the other option I was consider especially since I have some kevlar hard knuckle gloves and kevlar sleves so I could even punch them right through glass if I needed to.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m thinking go the defensive option probably.&nbsp; Upgrade my cars security system and make sure I have a way to defend my self when attacked since I know they are already planning on mugging me (really looking forward to the CCW permit).

				heres a suggestion get your crew together and go beat the living shit out of those fuckers to show them who really runs shit then go to landlord and see if you could get them evicted or beat yourself up then call the cops and tell them your neighbors just assaulted you that should make the pigs do something i personally like the first choice though

				The problem with violence is it can escalate. If these are three wideboys looking to indimidate the new neighbour a good kicking might well do the trick. The problem is if they also have &#039;a crew&#039; or if one of them has the psycho gene (you know the one, he&#039;s been done over so can&#039;t sleep at night until he gets his own back by however method&#039; things could escalate out of control.<br /><br />Not everyone (especially me, I&#039;m a nerdy 30-something engineer and the last time my friends say a gym was flicking rhrough infomercials) so for me personally I&#039;d have to be asking if the flat really is worth it? If you decide it really is and there&#039;s no other option I hope it all works out great for you man. NOthing worse than looking for a quiet life and someone they perceive as easy prey is game for a bit of fun.<br /><br />And make sure you win the firs time. And have suitcases ready at the door in case you don&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;d also be wary of shooting people/ Not interested in any colours but going by the USA news I hear here in the EU I hope you&#039;re all from the same ethnicity or that shit can turn nasty and ruin lives. As I said, only get one shot, have fun, jail is the last place I can think of having fun in.

				Yeah, it&#039;s a tough choice.&nbsp; I might cut my self up a bit and tell the police they came at me with a knife or something in the back.&nbsp; When it comes to escalation my state is extremely clear on allowing the use of deadly force when you feel threaten or if they break into your place of residence you can just shoot them we are an extremely gun friendly state.&nbsp; I am armed and ready to kill if they come after me.

				Simple fix. Take a few of your shotshells, open the end and pour out the steel shot. Replace it with rock salt and press the ends of the shell back in on it. Use candle wax to hold them down like they originally were. Next time you catch one of them slippin or creepin, bust a round of rock salt in his ass. Its not fatal, but trust me, he&#039;s gonna wish it was. Theres enough grains of powder in a 12 gauge 2 3/4&quot; shotshell to make rock salt break the skin at 12-15 yards. Ever put salt in an open wound? Yeah, you get the picture. Just bust the salt up into small grainy pieces so you get a better blast effect. In 10 minutes the salt in the wound effect will be gone, but the memory will forever be seared, both you and your victim lol. Still as loud as a regular load, and hurts like hell for 10-15 minutes so hes gonna think you shot him for real. Leaves no permanent effects. The salt holes in his skin will heal in a few days if you break it up real good. And if he turns out to just be another punk and calls the law, all you gotta do is say if you shot him, wheres the evidence? Plus, when word gets out, which it will, NOBODY in your hood is gonna fuck with you lol
