				When the fight was broken up one of them was shouting &quot;hit me again motherfucker! I&#039;ll knock yo punk ass down!&quot; These people are all white nerds who program computers or work at organic food co-ops during the week. It&#039;s funny how people like that suddenly discover their inner Tyrone as soon as fists start flying, like they are an extra in Boyz N da Hood.<br /><br />The ones who are the most vocal in their demands for tolerance are the least tolerant and most hateful. The thinking process of PC Nazi&#039;s and liberals is from the Twilight Zone.<br /><br />The Marxist cultural revolution of Amerikwa continues. The abject hatred of spirituality is there for all to see.<br /><br />Video here:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utyiN7g0TkE<br /><br />News story here:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A street preacher was repeatedly punched in the head and kicked by two men at Seattle’s Pridefest this past Sunday – and the entire confrontation was caught on camera.<br /><br />In disturbing video footage uploaded on Youtube and reported by Seattle’s KOMO news, two Christian street preachers can be seen standing on a grassy area. One of the preachers holds a sign that says “Jesus saves and heals,” and “Repent or else,” while the other holds a Bible.<br /><br />At the beginning of the video a large man approaches the two preachers angrily, while another woman repeatedly shoves the man carrying the Bible and demands that the two men leave.<br /><br />The situation continues to heat up, until at one point a number of people attempt to snatch the sign away from the sign-wielding preacher. When one man succeeds, a melee ensues in which the angry man seen at the beginning of the video runs at and punches the preacher in the head several times while another kicks him repeatedly. Others attempted to break up the fight.<br /><br />Police arrested 36-year-old Jason Queree, who is suspected of being the main attacker. Queree reportedly has a long history of arrests and convictions for a wide variety of criminal behavior. A second suspect was also arrested. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />
