				Title: <strong>Storing Brick Weed</strong><br />

				Hello Walkers,<br /><br />Here I am posing another question to the wise weed-heads of the Wherever: I recently got a batch of brick weed that is actually pretty decent, and I was wondering how one would go about storing it long term. Yes, yes, brick weed is bloody boring but in my area it&#039;s some of the only available materials to smoke with.<br /><br />So far, I&#039;ve broken up and cut up some blocks to put into mason jars, and that&#039;s all I&#039;ve done to it so far. Would that be sufficient for a few months, or should I be investing in some harder gear like a minifridge to store the jars in? I&#039;m trying to avoid weed mold and would like to keep the moisture in the brick weed because it&#039;s already bricked, so why not keep it fresh? If this isn&#039;t possible, please let me know.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read up on methods of curing and storing weed, but this is typically for nugs and awesome buds so I was wondering if anyone had experience with bricks. I am talking about kilo-bricks, of course.<br /><br />Please let me know!

				I must also point out that this seems to be good quality weed, bricked for transport and sales in an area where weed is hard to get. When you break the brick up, you can smell a sharp, green smell, and I do mean sharp! I&#039;ve heard it could be a strain from Thailand bricked for export over the water. It&#039;s fairly green and has few seeds but a number of branches/stems, which was expected.<br /><br />In terms of smoke high, I ripped about 5-6 hits off a bong, probably about a US-sized bowl&#039;s worth. After that I could not feel my body at all. I wiggled my toes and waved my hands, it felt like I was in a me-sized robot that couldn&#039;t feel his hands or legs. Very good high. I&#039;ve smoked it again at a concert and this stuff gives me energy to walk around and smile and talk too, so I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s a Sativa or Indica. Probably Sativa.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts about storage!

				Send it all to me; I&#039;ll keep it fresh!<br /><br />Just kidding, I guess it really depends on how long you plan on storing it. Keeping them in mason jars should be fine for a few months; just to sure to &quot;burp&quot; them by opening them every so often to let excess moisture out. For a longer term storage, consider putting them in the coolest part of the fridge, and leave them alone until you have a need for it (constantly pulling it in and out of the fridge may cause excess moisture to build up).<br /><br />Grats on your awesome purchase :)

				Thanks for your reply g01den!<br /><br />That sounds like what I read online about storing weed long term. What I&#039;m concerned about is does this also apply to brick weed? What I&#039;ve read is that brick weed is weed that has typically been cured already. The stems (while compressed) are still bendy, so should I do something about the weed still? I&#039;m planning on keeping this to sell steadily as the months go by, so I&#039;m trying to get on top of the mold issues that typically crop up for long term storage.

				Jars are a great way to store your weed just keep them in a cool, dry, dark place and also &quot;burp&quot; the jars once a week or two.

				Does anyone else have good info on how to store good brick weed? So far I&#039;ve been burping the jars once a day every day. I forgot about a (thankfully) small rubbermaid of the same stuff, and it grew mold!! This is probably after 4-5 days of not providing airflow.<br /><br />Is there a limit to how long you should be burping (daily) the jars? I think my brick still has a lot of moisture in it, but I don&#039;t want to break it up to get rid of the stems and seeds because that&#039;s how people like their weed here. It&#039;s easier to determine the amount due to a brick&#039;s somewhat regular size.<br /><br />Anyone else have any tips on storing brick weed long term?

				I was in your situation many months ago and from what I have learned from many friends who have been growing 10+ years is Rule #1 keep it in something air tight if you plan on having it long-term, if you are really going to be holding on to your weed for awhile, Vacuum seal and place into a Mason jar, to be specific, don&#039;t get the twist top jars, get ones with a snap lip of some sort that have a rubber seal under the lid, those are much better than twist top and make sure it&#039;s a good quality jar and the rubber isn&#039;t loose/crappily installed. <br /><br />Also, keep your weed in a dark and humid place, I personally I don&#039;t have any humid places in my house so I keep my big orders of things vac sealed, inside a snap lip jar inside a black thick garbage bag to deflect light.<br /><br />Also, NEVER freeze your plant, don&#039;t put it in a freezer/fridge ever for it can affect the potency harshly, some people might disagree with me so I will let you do the research on that for yourself.<br /><br />Aside from that you are all set! happy storing!

				&nbsp;:( Found what I think is mold on two of my (thankfully) tiny rubbermaid containers. I think it&#039;s mold because it looks like tiny blue dots all over the weed in the container. Anyone know what I&#039;m talking about?<br /><br />The weed I put in the bigger mason jars seem okay though. I am afraid of taking them out to inspect them though. I&#039;ve been burping them daily, and I suspect the reason why the rubbermaids have mold is because I didn&#039;t think I would need to burp them. Does daily burping keep mold away? I think the brick is still pretty wet (stems snap after a bit of bending).<br /><br />How does one go about drying a brick of weed?
