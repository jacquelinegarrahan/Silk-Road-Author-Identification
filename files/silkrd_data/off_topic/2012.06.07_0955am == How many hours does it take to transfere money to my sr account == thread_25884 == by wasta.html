				I did transfer some money about 7 hours ago, but it has not arrived yet.<br />Do I have to worry, or is it normal to take such a long time?

				How did you transfer it?&nbsp; Was this a BTC transfer from a personal wallet to your SR wallet address or a transfer from a third party exchanger to your SR wallet?<br /><br />Did you initiate the transfer before or after SR was down for maintenance?<br /><br />If started the transfer just before SR went down, it is possible the money arrived, then was lost when they went down, as it looks like they did a restore from an a backup that was several hours old.<br /><br />A number of people are posting about orders the were closed and finalized now re-opened or BTC that were received now gone.<br /><br />If it is the case that you sent the BTC just before the site went down I suggest you gather all the information you can and have it ready to submit to SR if necessary.<br /><br />If you sent it after SR went down and you are using your own wallet, make sure the block chains are up to date.&nbsp; Your wallet won&#039;t send anything until it has a complete block chain.

				Usually takes less than an hour for me, but had been up to a day before. <br />Dont worry, if you want to check it then go to BlockChain to look for your transaction, Bitcoin&#039;s don&#039;t just disappear.<br /><br />Locker.

				Great support from you all, thanks.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care for the 41 cents but want to know what went wrong, before I make a big payment now.<br /><br />A moderator of SR is investigating the transfer right now.<br /><br />It has been over 3 day&#039;s now.<br /><br />Payments before and after the 41 cent transfer did arrive as they should have been.<br /><br />Would have liked to know the cause of the disappearance&nbsp; though.<br /><br />I will update the result of the investigation.<br /><br />Wasta<br /><br />EDIT; Update<br /><br />SR has compensated me jet an other week later.<br />So about 10 days in total.<br />They (SR) did say that they were sorry, but no explanation about what went wrong here.<br />I am by far not the only one who had a money-transfer gone bad from their own to their SR account.<br /><br />As I have pointed out before (in an other topic) the blockchain showed that the money did arrive on the given account-nr, but never was added to my account.<br /><br />Before they said they were sorry for me and compensated me, I received this from the SR moderator;<br /><br /><br /><br />SR Support&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;re: subject<br /><br />It seems the coins have indeed arrived:<br /><br />https://blockexplorer.com/address/1DE1zvcArhkXvHtwC1qMfc1hncn5C3fFF6<br /><br />~SR Support&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br /><br /><br />Strange, things happening here on the SR money-flow, and a little to often.<br />The money SR gave me back was exactly the right amount.<br />Debit and credit were again in balance after the compensation.<br /><br />Someone should be collecting those transfers that went bad, and a explanation would be welcome too.<br />The chain-block showed that the money that I supposedly received was already sent to other accounts.<br />Wondering how that have been the case, because I have to give my 18 digit security-code, before I can make a transfer. Besides the case is, it never arrived on my account (untill the a mod (staff) sent the money 10 days later.<br /><br />Maybe it can be a good thing to have all our money withdrawn from all sr-accounts, and see if all the money that was sent to SR is indeed still on SR.<br />If they fail to do so, they are clearly doing things with our money, without our permission.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see why we should not doing such a thing.<br />If SR thinks that that is not nice, so be it.<br />Bullocks, because it is our money so we can do what ever we like to do with it.<br /><br />Why should we trust those guy&#039;s who run the site of SR, or being nice to them.<br />I can not see one reason that justifies it, to do so.<br /><br />Wasta
