				So I was in the public library a few days ago, and a 16 year old girl started talking me. I am 29, but she is really hot, so I said I was 19. She said &quot;yeah, you look about 19&quot;. Anyway after flirting with me for a bit, she asked for my phone number, which I gave to her. She phoned me yesterday saying she wants to see me again, so I invited her over to my place, which she gladly accepted. <br /><br />Now the law and morality are not equivalent. I realize that 16 is too young in the eyes of the law, but is it morally bad to have sex with a 16 year old girl?&nbsp; hypothetically speaking. Not that I would have sex with her, but I think she is trying to seduce me, so I need to think of the moral aspect of the situation I have allowed myself to get into. :(

				I wouldn&#039;t be concerned at all to fuck her as she probably craves for it.<br />Lol maybe she is 14 if she told you she is 16.

				If there is grass on the pitch, PLAY BALL! <br /><br />On a serious note, teenage girls and women in general, love to talk. So if you fuck her around, she will tell and that shit will quickly escalate to the cops. <br /><br />The question you must ask yourself, is 16 yo puss worth getting arrested for or worse...<br /><br />Gluck.

				In the words of Kendrick Lamar or some other dumb fuck, &quot;YOLO&quot;<br /><br />Met a 14yo when I was 20. Nothing like that young pussy, not to sound like a pedo at all hahah.&nbsp; 8) If you think she digs it, it shouldn&#039;t matter.

				To offer a slightly different view, you already know you are taking advantage of her hormone-driven state. You remember being 16. Sort of, right?<br /><br />You&#039;d fuck any girl that came along, I&#039;m sure. That&#039;s normal.<br /><br />Now you&#039;re looking at a girl that doesn&#039;t know what she wants, and barely understands why, and you could easily take advantage of her inability to actually make a free choice here. Yes, that&#039;s a different way to look at it, but look at her motivation. She&#039;s curious, and biologically driven. Is she actually interested in you? Or just the age difference, that you appear as an older and wiser man that she&#039;s likely never had before?<br /><br />She&#039;s lacking free will in this situation. You&#039;re playing with something more than fire here, for reasons mentioned above. But the decision is yours, and only yours between the two of you.

				If she want to whle she&#039;s clean... I wouldn;t mind the age differtence so much but also not lie about it which you did.<br /><br />Only one option left, chill with her and let her do what she wants if that is what you want...<br /><br />She might be boring though cuz of no experience....<br /><br />Or make some delicious ghb for her, give her kamagra but frst dye it pink and then calll it lovegra...<br />I think she might like that, assuming you&#039;re not some ugly psychopath...<br /><br />Then it would be BAD!!!!&nbsp; ::)<br />No seriously, watchout. Dunno where you live but some chicks are sick and use their phone and then go to the cops cuz you gave them what they wanted but they are ssick in the head...

				uk age of consent is 16 isn&#039;t it? they made all that fuss about moving it down to 16 for the gays too a few years ago. meeting a child and immediately knocking 10 years off your age to make it seem morally acceptable sounds like predatory behaviour but i don&#039;t think it&#039;s illegal(depending on your location). if you tell her you&#039;re 29 and she&#039;s still up for it, she&#039;s probably got daddy issues and already a bit screwy in the head.

				That would be a 100% no-go for me, even though it would be legal where i am located.<br /><br />The fact that makes it even worse is your lie about the age. super creepy to be honest ::).
