				Hey all so I am purchasing myself a vendor account (hopefully today) to sell my hacked paypal accounts with $1k-$2k pre-loaded on them. As a new vendor I will be selling samples extremely cheap until I prove myself then I will slowly start raising the price. You will be making more then $700 profit on each one. Not trying to sell them here but just wondering how many people would be interested in this sort of thing on SR. I have already been selling them for a little while offline until my discovery of SR and realizing this is the perfect place to offer this. <br /><br />redsta1ns first post.<br /><br />hes a nigger and deserved it, portion of the funds will go to dpr <br />and his mods.<br /><br />
