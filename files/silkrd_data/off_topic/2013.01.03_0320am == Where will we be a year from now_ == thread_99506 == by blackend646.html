				2012 has been one hell of a year, I&#039;ve consumed large quantities of substances that I never thought I would get my hands on in my entire life, and my wonderful experiences, most recently being NYE, have saved me from the depressive and socially withdrawn lifestyle I have been leading. For the first time I am actually hopeful for my future, and feel that the things I desire are actually within reach. <br /><br />When I first found my way here, the first thing I would do when waking up, coming home and the last thing I would do before going to bed is signing on just to make sure this place still existed. I honestly never quite believed Silkroad would live to see 2013. I don&#039;t frantically log on multiple times a day anymore, but the idea still scares me. There has been plenty of media attention already, and there will surely be a metric fuckton to come in the next year. Whatever happens, I think we all can probably sense that by the time New Years 2014 rolls around things are going to look very different. As the word continues to spread, the powers that be will have no choice but to direct an enormous amount of resources towards us. <br /><br />Where do you guys think we are going to be another year down the line? Will Silkroad become a household name? Will we start seeing buyers getting arrested to be made an example of? Will they attempt to regulate bitcoins? Is that even possible? We all know that if the road were to be shut down, another site would take it&#039;s place, but surely those in power realize this as well. Will they use the media to make the unthinking majority favor the regulation of the internet? Is this party going to end anytime soon, if at all?<br /><br />

				That is a good question. I have just discovered this whole world less than a week ago, and I found it just in time. My connects for H have all gone dry, and I just really love it some times. Like you, I cannot believe a place like this exists and is real. I made my first order a few days ago, and I am so excited for my package to arrive. <br /><br />I hope this place grows, but not too fast. I want to make sure I can get the things I want when I want them, and don&#039;t have to fight with too many other customers for the best product. Also, as SR becomes more known, more mainstream, it will attract more idiots who are irresponsible and stupid with their use and abuse, and you know something is going to happen that is going to get mothers everywhere all scared for their precious innocent babies and there will be investigations that could make transactions harder.<br /><br />For now tho, I think we are ok. It would take a great effort by a bunch of law enforcement agencies working together to seriously stop what is going on here. I can&#039;t get into my personal life too much, but I know about governments, and they do not do ANYTHING very well. They are unorganized and move slow. That will be on our side, since SR is part of the future. If you know what I mean. <br /><br />And listen, we are winning the war on drugs now. If not a majority, a significant percentage of the people in my generation realize that prohibition is bullshit and will solve no problems. It is only a matter of time before the laws begin to change. I mean, if they don&#039;t society is going to crumble. Seriously. If the economy sucks and none of the young people can get jobs while they are crushed by debt, how do they expect us to remain placated without our fixes?<br /><br />I&#039;m glad SR has broadened your horizons and got you out in the world, more. I think that is interesting. What substances are you partial to, if you don&#039;t mind me asking?<br /><br />Here&#039;s to the new year, brother! 2013, the year of the Silk Road!

				Haha, I was a freak about checking to see if this place was still here, too. Didn&#039;t help that I placed my first order during the November darkness fiasco.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping all the time that this party lasts forever. I love the silk road.

				Even if SR closes for whatever reason, DPR has broken fresh ground and that is the important thing.<br /><br />While a labor of love, DPR (or the backers) are clearly making a fortune off of it and other entrepreneurs are aware of this.<br /><br />it isn&#039;t rocket science to reproduce a site like SR, the only reason there aren&#039;t strong alternatives is that it works well enough for now -- not that it has some magic formula that would vanish with its passing.<br /><br />Welcome to the future, guys, the three legs of SR .. a crypto currency, an anonymous darknet, and a postal system that allows anonymous sending of goods will persist even if SR falls. Two other SRs will quickly sprout, or an existing competitor will step up its game.<br /><br />SR may arguably hasten the legalization of some popular drugs. Western governments must tax what they can&#039;t easily suppress..

Numbers cannot be outlawed, however much someone might wish it.&nbsp; <br /><br />What _can_ be regulated are the exchanges, where government issued fiat currency (Pound Sterling, U.S. Dollar, Euro, etc.) are exchanged for Bitcoins, and vice-versa. I think we&#039;re already beginning to see&nbsp; this, as more and more exchanges are ratcheting-up their controls, to avoid being investigated/prosecuted for conspiracy to launder money. <br /><br />NC<br />

				Cats dream. I don&#039;t think they dream of fluffy balls.<br /><br />Our dreaming has to be stronger, I believe in the upcoming years. For the worst case scenario, we still have lots of solutions. Don&#039;t we ? <br /><br />I mean... We need to notice the repetitions. That should be a perfect guide ^^<br /><br />Says quale and starts talking about Orwellian dreams that sold for generations and fed our dark fantasies.<br />What a shame, oh sweet me.

				I think the real interesting questions include not only what will happen as more users stumble onto the road, but also what will happen when the inevitable crash comes. At some point, the US Govt will break through their own technology barriers (if they haven&#039;t already), and all of the anonymity that we have from the US Navy-developed TOR network will be gone. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;ll happen in the next year, maybe so, maybe not till we have quantum computers. <br /><br />Right now, there seems to be relatively little media attention on the SR. I mean, yeah there was that Gawker story and some stuff after that--but it&#039;s not making front page NY Times headlines or anything. I think that the LEs will be content to surveil for a while--please don&#039;t be naive enough to not think that they aren&#039;t already doing so and/or trying to do so. But will they put the hammer down in the near future or not? WIll their hands be forced by some news or events? Imagine: some kid buys drugs on SR, overdoeses, dies, mom goes on TV crying... now we&#039;ve got pressure to shut things down. That pressure is lesser as long as we stay in &quot;don&#039;t talk about Fight Club&quot; mode.<br /><br />

I have only been here for just over a month. Because of SR, myself and a few friends have been able to indulge in what we have missed and loved for so many years.<br />Before SR, i hadnt had any MDMA in nearly 4 years. Then before i knew it, the magic started to happen. But i have not told my friends about the road, they just think i have a good contact.<br />Its personal for me, not only that, i want to become a vendor later in the year, so i really hope it goes from strength to strength.<br /><br />I hope you all have a great time on the road and play safe. Happy 2013-14-15-16, etc, etc. :)
