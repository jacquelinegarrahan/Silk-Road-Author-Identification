				So a friend of mine, actually the guy who thinks the government controls SR, is throwing a small group mushroom party. His house is already trippy in itself, with the butterfly house out back and full dojo inside, but we were looking to do something different. These will be hard dose trips, and we were looking for some ingenuity and originality for some ideas to make our time memorable. I thought, who better to ask than the good people here on SR Forums? (the irony) Maybe you guys have done something crazy or new you&#039;d like to share? Everyone appreciates trip ideas, it only makes the community better.<br /><br />Maybe people who view this in the future will use the ideas, and even build on them.

				Personally I love to go to the beach and go underwater when I&#039;m day tripping. I live on the Gulf though. Walmart is always a crazy place to&nbsp; go to as well!

				Just trip during the day and force yourself to get up (it&#039;s hard to do on large doses) from the bed or couch and walk around until you find your legs. Then go outside and commune with teh natural world. There&#039;s nothing better that that on shrooms. <br /><br />You feel as if the entire world is one breathing, vibrating, living ball of wonder. You really are at one with teh world and the universe. Try to &quot;bring the trip home&quot;.<br /><br />goblin

				Once I brought $1500 worth of Lego blocks and spent an entire acid trip playing with them.<br /><br />Now it all just sits there in a box for when friends bring their kids around.<br /><br />Another time me and a friend got scuba gear and a couple of tanks and we were diving in his pool tripping out of our brains.<br /><br />Those were my 2 funnest trips, I hate people who like to be all introspective when they trip and have circular thoughts about irrelevant crap that sounds lame to any sober person. The funnest trips are always spent doing random cool things.
