				OK, I find mad inconsistencies in the forums, as I am sure we all do, but I couldn&#039;t resist asking:<br />Most people advise to use a wifi connection at a coffee shop, library, etc. OK, then, I am supposed to bring up SR&#039;s page, with pics of DRUGS on it, in my local coffee shop, or library? Are you fucking KIDDING me? Do you people really do that??? <br />Also, I see most people seem to hate laptops, according to PriscillaMarie90&#039;s post &quot;Help me find a new laptop&quot; (not going after link) so.....are you all taking your towers down to the local coffee shop??? Seriously? <br />How can you be against laptops, but for wifi?? It makes absolutely no fucking sense to me. Sorry, it just doesn&#039;t. <br />Here&#039;s is how it reads out in your forums: Laptops suck, use towers, never use your home internet connection, always use wifi from library or coffee shop. <br />Whatever. <br /><br />Next is shipping: ALWAYS use a printed label. OK, how do you print customs labels?? Seriously. That&#039;s my question. HOW DO YOU PRINT CUSTOMS LABELS?? Any piece of mail from tiny to large, leaving the USA, needs to have a green customs label. I find printing on them to be an extremely difficult task. How do you fill out the customs label without hand writing it? <br /><br />Thanks, if you have the answers. <br />Fuck you, if you just came to troll, or otherwise be worthless.

The reason we all use TOR is so we don&#039;t have to use a coffee shop.

				OK, guess I&#039;ll find all the links, but I have read at least 50 times that is what to do. Never use my home connection, even with TOR.

And querying for &#039;wifi&#039; or internet or connection proved to be even more crazy! Too many threads with those words. But, I have read this over and over, and over, and thought it was odd. <br />In reality, it seems as though every single aspect of this can be argued. As every single subject in the forums usually is.

				Haha oh I must have slept on all the threads you&#039;ve read.&nbsp; I missed the Priscilla thread too, I would have joined the argument and said I &lt;3 to access SR via laptop. Mobility afforded by it.<br /><br />As for printed labels... I was thinking they meant just the name and address of recipient.. not the entire customs label. Could be wrong though.. <br /><br />
