				Has anyone been watching the Drugs, Inc series on National Geographic Channel?&nbsp; I saw the one on Hashish and learned a few things I didn&#039;t really know.&nbsp; They follow it from the pollen to it being smuggled and consumed.&nbsp; &nbsp;They also had one on Ecstasy.&nbsp; Showed the trees being illegally cut down in Cambodia to get the sassafras oil and even had drug labs in Amsterdam showing how it&#039;s made and pills being pressed.&nbsp; They don&#039;t really show too much of a drugs are bad bias it&#039;s more just information.&nbsp; But they do show the consequences of the drug industry and some of that speaks for&nbsp; itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found the cutting down of majestic trees in SE Asia so ravers can dance is kind of disturbing.&nbsp; Gonna watch the psychedelics one next.<br />If you have the chance it&#039;s pretty interesting stuff to watch.

				Yes. One of a best documentary series about drugs. Very informative and impartial. One thing that I can not understand: how they found dealers, traffickers and others and why did they agree to filming?<br /><br />First season can be founded in HD on Pirate Bay http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5703269/National_Geographic_Drugs_Inc._2010_HDTV_720p_H264-BeLLBoY(Kingd<br />Second season&nbsp; online (episode about hallucinogens coming soon) http://www.tvduck.com/Drugs,-Inc..html

				i haven&#039;t watched any of the drugs inc. but did watch some of the &quot;drugged:&nbsp; high on insert drug here&quot; episodes.&nbsp; i&#039;ve got a decent amount of respect for nat geo.&nbsp; they seem to be one of the very few rational, scientific based reality/documentary channels on tv.&nbsp; they treat things relatively fairly...&nbsp; definately don&#039;t seem to be recieving the DEA grant to spew more anti-drug nonsense.<br />only other show that presents a good side to the drug war is Weed Wars on discovery.&nbsp; i hope that show changes alot of minds.<br />is this reflecting a changing attitude in society?&nbsp; i hope so.<br /><br />*destiny*

				If you are already knowledgeable about psychedelics, you might be disappointed in the show. <br /><br />&quot;The next hit of acid might be the one that kills you...&quot; WTF. There was alot of misinformation. <br />&nbsp;

				I love that show, it&#039;s actually very informative. Like I enjoyed watching how they make coke and in&nbsp; Peru they were selling the trash leftovers as a kinda shitty crack.
