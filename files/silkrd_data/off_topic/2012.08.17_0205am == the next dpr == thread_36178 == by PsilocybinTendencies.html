				Having recently rewatched the princess bride, I realized it&#039;s quite possible dpr plans to retire and pass on the title at some point.<br /><br />I for one would like to express my interest in this role.<br /><br />However I feel that kfmewkm and nomad bloodbath would be more suitable potential inheritors.<br /><br />Limetless would also be a candidate if he willing to learn the computer shit (not that I&#039;m any expert, but I&#039;m capable and willing to learn what id need to know to fulfill the role if the opportunity ever presented itself).<br /><br />Who would you nominate as the next dpr?

				It&#039;s a shame that DigitalAlch is gone, aside from him I think that the poster &quot;guru&quot; would be the best choice by a good deal, he seems really smart to me and clearly knows a lot about computers, either that or one of the relatively silent admins.<br /><br />edit:&nbsp; Although kmf and nomad would definitely be a good choice as well.

				Let us say for hypothetical reasons this is true and DPR wasn&#039;t 1 person but simply a title that was passed on, if this was the case I would not accept it if offered because for 1, I am too hot-headed to do this and plus as both a vendor and a Mod that, and let&#039;s be real with this, has a fair amount of influence it would not be appropriate for me to take that sort of role. Also I am clueless with computers and I do not have either the patience or mindset to learn things like coding. My area is money and drugs, not I.T. If this was to happen I would personally like to see either Nomad Bloodbath, squidShepard or Indica. <br /><br />However, I don&#039;t think this article is correct and I believe that DPR is a real individual because it makes much more sense logically and as such, long may his tenure, reign, captaincy or whatever you want to call it continue. :)

				Here is the link:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36162.0<br /><br />Oh, and you seem like you&#039;d be a good DPR to me Lim, power seems to humble those who don&#039;t want it.&nbsp; In my opinion it is the irony of most political systems that, due to the fact that there are no positive motivations for a person to seek power in the first place, anyone willing to work hard for power is inevitably the least deserving to attain it.

				How do you guys not realize the switch has already been made lol? The current DPR is the new guy, hence the new name and why they picked it. The original Silk Road guy is long gone rollin in the dough from whatever he sold the site for. You really think he didn&#039;t have some ridiculous offers from investors or gangs wanting to buy the site? He&#039;s not dumb. He cashed out and dipped while he still could.

And thanks for the vote of confidence JSB but I really don&#039;t think I&#039;d make a good DPR, my role in SR is more like crowd control and cracking skulls when they need to be cracked to get things done. This isn&#039;t what a leader does but what leaders need reliable people to do, which I hope is why I was given the Mod position and now Spam Buster. Also my business interests would create a conflict of interest which I could quite easily see hindering SR naturally thriving and evolving like it should.<br /><br />Anyway this is a moot point, DPR is DPR, the Mods mod, the Vendors vend and I Spam bust and do a little of everything and thus the world keeps turning as it should and everyone is happy. :)

				Without trying to sound sycophantic, I think DPR&#039;s great success has been his ideology. Silk Road as a technical exercise would have been inevitable in some form. The thing I love so much about the &#039;Road&#039; (compared to, say, BMR) is DPR&#039;s leadership and the path he&#039;s chosen for this project. He&#039;s making a stand for something he passionately believes in, and is genuinely trying to improve this world in some way. <br /><br />I&#039;m so glad we have no CP, hitmen, stolen goods and other such harmful things on sale here. Silk Road could so easily have been all about the money, with someone else in charge. DPR does deserve every cent he makes though, he really has put his neck on the line for something he believes in. How many of us could claim to have done such a thing? DPR could be one of many people, in that case they all deserve some praise.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll say it again... THANK YOU DPR (and all involved) for giving Silk Road to the world. Because whatever happens in the end, Silk Road has become an epoch-making and world changing event. With the added bonus that I&#039;ve got my hands on some good shit along the way! ;D&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />EDIT: Just re-read this post and God does it sound sycophantic!

Will probably include blind mixing for bitcoins and an integrated way to send bitcoins / blinded tokens simply by selecting your buddy you wish to send them to, or a nice GUI widget such that every post of a person has a button that lets you click and send an amount of bitcoins / blinded tokens to the poster... escrow could easily be added to that but I will not be doing much work on that. I will probably run a blind mix for free provided people who find the system useful donate towards it, otherwise I will charge a percentage for blind mixing. SR could easily run his own blind mix as well. Of course it will be open source and I expect and hope that every line of code will be throughly analyzed. My goal is not to make an e-commerce platform but rather a decentralized encrypted mix/PIR forum and messaging system

Currently I have figured out how to fashion it together and I am satisfied that it will scale to forums and be secure if properly implemented, now I am just pounding away at it trying to get it finished and ready for auditing, the design is stable and extremely unlikely to change further (and is not related to any attempts I had before at this, or made by me for that matter, because I do not have such leet skills :(&nbsp; &nbsp;, thankfully I do not have to ) .

Currently I have figured out how to fashion it together and I am satisfied that it will scale to forums and be secure if properly implemented, now I am just pounding away at it trying to get it finished and ready for auditing, the design is stable and extremely unlikely to change further (and is not related to any attempts I had before at this, or made by me for that matter, because I do not have such leet skills :(&nbsp; &nbsp;, thankfully I do not have to ) .<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />like a fuckin&#039; bawss.

SR has changed that, permanently.<br /><br />Reputation Systems, Web of Trust, Escrow with (potentially) anonymous digital cash. Advanced cryptography changes that lack of internal black market regulation. The majority of people still don&#039;t grasp the implications of that, even on the Silk Road, it&#039;s just too big a change and there is actually nothing to compare it to in history that I can think of.<br /><br />But.. we should not throw away the other leverage points that black markets have, just because we have a shiny new toy.<br /><br />Right now SR is the mothership more or less. Which is great, because it has shown what can be done. In that sense it is mission accomplished from an agorist point of view.<br /><br />I think however, that there is a great need for decentralization and market competition on the darknet. A variety of markets will specialize in certain product, tweak with different policies, even entirely different conceptions of economy, different technologies e.g. other cryptocurrencies, interception tags, elliptic curve cryptography, comms support systems like kmfkewn&#039;s SE project, Cables, even different Anonymity networks other than Tor and so on. I don&#039;t think there is a one size fits all market that will suit everybody. Perhaps there is now for the most part, but what about when the market is 10, 100, 1000 times larger? Because I don&#039;t think that is unrealistic. Growth has been exponential so far and I think there is a vast untapped reservoir of potential marketshare still to come, even for decades to come as a technology adept generation grows up.

Besides, there is much specialization that has yet to occur, different businesses shall find different niches. To be honest, I think there is more than enough market share for all in any case, it&#039;s going to a very long time before there&#039;s a recession on the darknet due to economic factors. <br /><br /><br />Finally, we are capitalists.

				Yes I envision a small confederation of servers&nbsp; (maybe two dozen) run by trusted/known figures , not necessarily from any illegal scene at that (for a random example the tormail people may be interested in participating) forming into a larger system that benefits the users of all of the participating nodes and the node operators as well. The biggest concern I have is in maximizing the use of any such system though because you really are blending it with the set of people using a system and if it is only used by people in drug scene it wont be getting the true benefits it would if it had a diverse range of users.

				I would have to respectfully disagree Pine. If another market had emerged at the same time as Silk Road and been pushed by someone like DPR in the same way then yes, it is possible. However because no such market emerged and because of the amount of time and the amount of success SR has had it would now he impossible to compete really. Look at BMR which has really the same sort of structure as SR and even free accounts which should attract more vendors because it involves less start-up costs but yet it does not? Why? Because there is no need to go to another because SR has it all already. <br /><br />Talking strictly non-private market-places here by the way, not the private scene.

Yes, absolutely.<br /><br />One tiny example is that we could develop a new kind of market for the darknet, one that is relatively rare in the clearnet, but very useful for our purposes. That&#039;s a predication market. A subscription to the data from a predication market for vendors, a source of work for newcomers to SR and other markets. It could be quite remarkable. How many businesses effectively have the Oracle of Delphi working for them? Not even some intelligence agencies have that kind of risk assessment capability.<br /><br />Anyway, let&#039;s just cordially agree to disagree.

				I&#039;m with Pine on this one.<br /><br />Ordering drugs online has yet to catch on. Once it really does, it&#039;s either going to go one of two directions.<br /><br />It will be cracked down on, somehow, even if it means invading our privacy in the name of stopping terrorists (from an american perspective, other countries will justify it in their own unique ways). Which would suck.<br /><br />Or Pine&#039;s dream will play out. The problem is that this service is reliant on the postal service.<br /><br />At some point I think the postal service is going to no longer be an option, one way or the other. So we&#039;re going to have to adapt to that if we&#039;re going to keep this going, and create new marketplaces.<br /><br />And the drug market is big enough to support multiple SRs. The question is just how is this going to play out when it becomes widespread?
