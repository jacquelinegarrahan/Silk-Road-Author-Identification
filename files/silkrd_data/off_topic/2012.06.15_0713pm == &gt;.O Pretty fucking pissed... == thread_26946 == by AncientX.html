				So....Lately, i&#039;ve been helping a friend unload his weed on UMB since i don&#039;t have a SR vendor account yet.<br />Well, we started like 2 months ago, just selling what he had grown to friends, and a few UMB mates. <br /><br />Well....fast forward to today @.@ My grower is being a complete fucking twat and taking the reigns himself....saying &quot; Fuck You, I don&#039;t need you anymore now that i know the process of selling online &quot; <br />Pretty fucking pissed off, not only do i not have anymore fucking weed to smoke or sell ( with people blowing up my fucking phone every 5 -10 minutes for a bag ) <br /><br />But now, i have to find a new way to make some fucking bitcoin in hopes of being able to get more green for my constant back pain and ankle pains. @.@<br />I have a medical card in my state, but we don&#039;t have dispensaries yet, and i cannot for the life of me track down anyone else i use to purchase from on the streets. <br /><br />So, basically, im just asking for serious suggestionson what i can do for more bitcoin, or if theres any vendors out there who may need an extra set of hands to help out with finding buyers.<br /><br />Or hell, even any vendor willing to send me a gram of bud to get through the Week XD ( previous things preffered )<br /><br /><br />This week and most of the month has been total shit, the only thing i have to look forward to is the last half gram of coke, and 300mg of molly that has to be split between 2 people this weekend...<br /><br /><br />@.@ Fuck my life....why do people have to be so fucking greedy?<br />I mean, am i out of line to say that its fucked up of my grower to just cut me out like that, after putting my name, and my rep on the line for his ass?

				No offense hombre, but this sounds like it&#039;s your fault. Now this may be due to poor wording or whatnot, but your post does a poor job of making you seem like the victim here. If I didn&#039;t know any better, I&#039;d call this begging. ??? My only response is that you need to find a real career to support yourself, because your grower has the full right to go solo on selling his own product. :-\

				Okay, yea i could see how it comes off as begging without a bit more info hahaha. <br /><br />The plants he&#039;s growing, are from seeds i provided, the lights he uses, are ones i purchased, basically a good majority of the set up he has now is thanks to me, and several friends who just didnt have the real estate to grow on the scale that we wanted to. <br /><br />And seeing as how it was just me and him left in what started in a 5 man operation, you can see how i have a full right to be pissed off.<br /><br />But that was last week :D this week is much better, new connections, new business opportunities :D shit is awesome

				this is why you should never teach your partner how to do YOUR part, cause as soon as he learns how to do YOUR part, why would he want to pay you?<br /><br />don&#039;t mean to be rude, but just giving you something to think about for the future..

				Learn how to grow fungus, its so easy and low low overhead.&nbsp; Sounds to me like you should have never revealed your trade secrets. I have taught others how to grow bulk fungus, but the idiots never fully can grasp it.<br /><br />Its actually kind of a talent to manufacture consistant, potent, bulk shrooms.&nbsp; Pftek in your bedroom fishtank is one thing, knocking down six ounce dry flushes off of a single tub is another.<br /><br />Now try running twenty tubs and pulling six zips per tub first flush, 3 zips per tub second and 2 on third flush. Thats 220 ounces dry from a single spawn run.&nbsp; From pressure coocker to ziplock usually takes me about 22 days.<br /><br />

				DomesticShrooms -- what type of spawn and substrate are you using? Also inoculation from LC I assume?&nbsp; I&#039;m impressed you can get flushes in 3 weeks. <br />And treesplease, the money in mushrooms is obscene.&nbsp; Like 5$ to make 200$ obscene.

				Welcome to drug dealing. If you dont bring anything to the table you dont get a seat. No one will send you free weed because you do not have any. That is ridiculous, how entitled do you feel to other peoples things? If you provided your friends with the seeds and lights with the intent of having him &quot;owe you one&quot; for the rest of his life, have him sign a waiver or some shit. If you do somthing for someone it should be from the kindness of your heart, not a &quot;you better do what I say forever&quot;. He is doing a service to his customers cutting you out of the picture. <br />Be useful, or stop complaining. And I can not beleive u asked for a free gram.<br />Also you sound like law enforcement asking if people need help dealing their drugs as if you would meet them in person. If you did not mean that, you meant that they would ship you drugs on a front.

But you gave all that shit up to him so of course he&#039;s gonna drop you. He doesn&#039;t need you anymore. Completely, 100% your fault. You shouldn&#039;t hate him for your bad move. It&#039;s just business, and he doesn&#039;t need you for business anymore.

				I feel like your leaving out some information, thats kind of important. Idk though...hopefully you won&#039;t be so trusting of people in the future. People change when money is involved. Why don&#039;t you just start a grow op yourself?

				This is why i haven&#039;t told a single soul about SR, IRL. I mean i rarely sell, but if i do then its only to close mates and this makes me a few bob for the month. If they new about SR then they wouldn&#039;t need to buy off me anymore. I know it sounds awful selfish, but the less people know about SR the better.
