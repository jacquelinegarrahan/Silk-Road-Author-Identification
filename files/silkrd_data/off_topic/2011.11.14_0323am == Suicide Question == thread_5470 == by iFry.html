				Unfortunately fake IDs are not my area of expertise, try looking around for a bit before you cross the point of no return. I&#039;m not going to try to convince you not to do it since it&#039;s not my place, but suicide should always be an absolute last resort. Good luck with whatever you choose and I wish you only the best!

				I don&#039;t know that you&#039;ll die. It depends on weight, tolerance, etc. If you do wish to kill yourself, and I do believe that is every individual&#039;s right, I would recommend looking into Exit International. They have a lot of helpful information and you can connect with the right people to get some less painful drugs to die with, that way your end doesn&#039;t have to be miserable. If you do live, good luck with whatever path you choose. :)

				I dont think anyone has the right to take a human beings life, even their own.&nbsp; Life is precious. Enjoy it while you got, you&#039;ll be dead soon via life anyways so why end it?&nbsp; Shit man if ur gonna fry yourself you might as well do a large dose of mescaline.&nbsp; It might just make you change your mid about suicide.&nbsp; Be positive man, the more negative you think, the more its gonna bring you down, and hang around positive people too man.&nbsp; Just chill bro, its all good.

If you have no idea how to do that, go to the nearest highway on ramp, smile, and stick your thumb out. You have to smile or you won&#039;t get picked up.

Just go. Shut the fuck up and stop whining, leave the TV&nbsp; and all the lights on, leave your mobile phone on the kitchen counter and walk away. After you hit the road, whichever direction you go in, if you still want to end your life in 30 days, you have my permission.<br /><br />No matter what happens after you get picked up on the HWY on-ramp, it&#039;s gonna be better then whatever is happening to you. So stop whining, leave everything behind, put one foot in front of the other and go.<br /><br />Don&#039;t even lock your front door on the way out.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Hi,<br /><br />I hope you find some other way to solve your problems, but just in case, here is a link to an imo very good overview of suicide methods.<br />If you really want to do it, do it in a way that does hurt as few people as possible and that has a high probability of success.<br />This guide has been created from years of conversations on alt.suicide.holiday (a newsgroup):<br /><br />http://www.depressed.net/suicide/suicidefaq/index.html<br /><br />From what I have read, strong anaesthetics are a good choice, if you can get them, or a gun, but here the results tend to be rather messy.<br />Please don&#039;t throw yourself in front of a train, I know two train-drivers who cannot really get over it even after years.<br /><br /><br />Br,<br /><br />Stephe

				Yea, either become a vagrant or enroll into a holy counsel. For example, in Thailand, there&#039;s a temple for ex-heroin and drug addicts to work and a shelter to stay under.

If you really have a scale and on one side is a new ID and the other side is taking your life with a bunch of downers, you need to rethink the point of view you&#039;re approaching this from. Your life is bad, things are horrible. Maybe you&#039;re about to go to prison for 15 years. Maybe your wife left you, took the kids and you&#039;re never going to see them again. Maybe you lost $250,000.00 of the Latin Kings money and they want to &quot;talk&quot; to you. Let me offer a clear&nbsp; alternative from an objective stranger:<br /><br />A new name with a photo ID is not necessary to start again. Since the alternative is suicide, here&#039;s what you need to do :<br /><br />Walk out of your apartment building or house or the homeless shelter with only a backpack. Do it tonight. You need ~2 pair of pants, ~5 pairs of underwear, ~5 - 10 pairs of clean socks, a few tshirts and something sorta business casual button down shirt wise. Maybe a good coat depending on where you live, a knife, perhaps a razor and a bar of soap. And most importantly, a towel. Do not forget the towel, it is critical. <br /><br />Get on the road. If you have no idea how to do that, go to the nearest highway on ramp, smile, and stick your thumb out. You have to smile or you won&#039;t get picked up. Normal smile.<br /><br />If you live in the US, head south. Alabama desperately needs farm workers because of the laws they just enacted to kick out undocumented immigrants. <br /><br />Go work on a tomato farm, or whatever the hell they grow in Alabama. <br /><br />Go. Just go. Shut the fuck up and stop whining, leave the TV&nbsp; and all the lights on, leave your mobile phone on the kitchen counter and walk away. After you hit the road, whichever direction you go in, if you still want to end your life in 30 days, you have my permission.<br /><br />No matter what happens after you get picked up on the HWY on-ramp, it&#039;s gonna be better then whatever is happening to you. So stop whining, leave everything behind, put one foot in front of the other and go.<br /><br />Don&#039;t even lock your front door on the way out.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this is good, but I also suggest that you have all of your utilities turned off. Bad credit can fuck ya, after you decide life with a job, and some good drugs is awesome! <br />I speak from experience. I have twice in my life, done just that. Packed up a backpack, I had a car...but I hit the road, found a job, showered at RV camps, slept in my vehicle. got back on track. Just remember...no&nbsp; matter how you feel, what you&#039;ve done, there&#039;s AT LEAST ONE PERSON who will miss you, and whose life YOU will destroy by killing yourself.

				Quoted from a pic i have:<br /><br />&quot;I never got why people would kill themselves. If you want to die you obviously don’t give a shit. like, about anyone. ‘cause if there is anyone who loves you, you don’t give a FUCK about them, or hurting them, and if there’s not, there’s no one to give a shit about.<br /><br />So instead of killing yourself why don’t you just get the fuck out? leave the basement, leave your house, leave the motherfucking country. go on an adventure. spend your time doing something awesome, like tracking down some terrorists. go be james bond. go fuck up a shark with a harpoon. danger? fuck that, you were going up against 100% death rate before, you’re being safe now. fuck EVERYTHING, man, the world is your oyster.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish I was suicidal. I’d pull the barrel out of my mouth and point it in the air, start a revolution, LIVE. move to barcelona, hit the bars, bang some chicks. STDs, who fucking gives a shit?<br /><br />And then when I’m done, maybe I wouldn’t want to kill myself, ‘cause I’ve seen how beautiful the world is.&quot;

You would need to take a dose into the 1000&#039;s of milligrams and even then you&#039;d probably just end up in a coma. When you mix benzo&#039;s with other drugs (including alcohol) that&#039;s where the risk of death is more likely. The likely cause of death would be either be respiratory failure/cardiac arrest because benzos can severely depress breathing and make it difficult to wake up..if you&#039;re sick from the effects of mixing drugs, you can literally choke on your own vomit. If you wanted to take a lethal overdose it would be better to choose an opiate drug, perhaps morphine or codeine which have relatively low LD50 (legal overdose). You would probably just go to sleep and stop breathing. <br /><br />Seriously though, if you are contemplating suicide and its not for sound reasons (like a terminal illness) then I would think again. There&#039;s nothing that can&#039;t be sorted out and it&#039;s not worth throwing your life away. You might just be depressed and need treatment. <br />

				I wanted to kill myself for most of my adult life. Now things have changed, for a first time in my life I have a good reason to stand up and live my life. I know how it feels to want to kill yourself. But if I was dead now, I will not be able to do some important things and I would not be able to enjoy things that happened to me and will most likely to happen in near future.<br /><br />It&#039;s ultimately OP decision to do the irreversible. There is some sort of heroism of being able to overcome the instinct of self-preservation and take away your own life. But if You decide to kill yourself, take some with you. Go to federal building and blow yourself up. Hijack airliner and smash into that fucking black NSA building. That&#039;s what I call real heroism. Going away with low doses of drugs is for pussies.

Seek help / don&#039;t seek help. Depression just makes it harder for you to see, or want to see, those choices.<br /><br />Some &quot;healthy&quot; people fall into depressive states due to loads of shit things happening to them. But very few gay people will say that events occurred in their life that made them gay.<br /><br />If you had compared a depressed person wanting to kill themselves to a gay person wanting to have same-sex sex, then you&#039;d be more accurate. <br />Neither of them have to act on their desires. But sure if the sex is between two consenting adults then what of it.<br /><br />But if there&#039;s anyone still on the planet that cares about the suicide victim, then i&#039;m sorry but that&#039;s a selfish act.<br />Of course someone who hasn&#039;t experienced the same state of mind can&#039;t understand why someone would kill themselves, &#039;cause they&#039;re looking at it objectively. But that doesn&#039;t make it any less selfish.

Good day sir.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t choose to became aroused. That is in human nature (and most animals nature) to be attracted to opposite sex. Some people somehow got this biologic function malfunctioning.<br /><br />Suicide in battle conditions or when experiencing great failures in personal life is heroic act. Not all are capable of this.

Seems like an easy thing to say when you&#039;re got access to a computer, internet and sufficient spending money to buy drugs. <br /><br />I mean really, there are people with horrific health problems who don&#039;t enjoy a single day of their lives. Or those who live in extreme poverty and suffer each day. I agree that life is definitely worth living (Having been suicidal at one point with depression but changing my view) however I don&#039;t think you can claim life is worth it for everyone.<br />

				As we are discussing the meaning and value of life, I&#039;m worried that original poster is last seen on November 14, 2011.<br /><br />BTW the life has no price tag attached. I think each life have different value for different people. Some of people will be remembered forever in history, and some of people not worth even dried dog shit. All I know it is unique and life for each of us happened only once in lifetime of universe.

				If you need to kill yourself, choose something not painful like Pentobarbital:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Human euthanasia<br /><br />Pentobarbital has also been used for physician-assisted suicide. In the US state of Oregon &quot;oral doses of a barbiturate&quot; have been used for this purpose.[6]<br /><br />In Switzerland, the only country that allows foreigners to have assisted suicide, the Dignitas clinic uses the antiemetic drug metoclopramide followed by sodium pentobarbital for the procedure.[7] It is also used in the Netherlands, and was used in the Northern Territory of Australia during the brief period in which euthanasia was permitted.[citation needed]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>More information:<br />http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20080721/wire/807210358<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to have an opinion without having an idea why you want to do it. Maybe you have a terminal disease, maybe a relative died... If psychological help wont do it, Pentobarbital is the best option.
