				Hello All,<br /><br />Lets say SR did get busted by LE (and no I am not paranoid this is a hypothetical)<br /><br />Is there any obvious plan B for us all?<br /><br />In the event the worst happened to DPR how can a simpleton like me keep up to date on any new markets popping up to take SR&#039;s place?<br /><br />Surely there has to be a blog or website somewhere on the clearweb that keeps abreast on the happenings on the darkweb??<br /><br />Look forward to comments....<br /><br />Cheers.<br />Dontchargeme

				Not going to name names of competitors but there are already sites out there that are pretty much identical to silk road. However they&#039;ve all paled in traffic to SR which has always been the best imo.<br /><br />But there are alternatives and a little bit of creative googling or going through the tor wiki will get you there.

				In that paper on the silk road the name has eluded me, two other sites were mentioned. One of them has shut down, the other one is still operating, albeit not very effective, that is probably changing as we speak, although i like to be part of this community and loyalty etc. i ain&#039;t gonna bet the ranch on one marketplace. <br /><br />The point is they will have to make it work or someone else will. And if this is still going on tuesday, the shit is going to hit the fan, but i have faith, i know how fast this BTC trading world can go... when money is involved people get really motivated and can move the whole kit and kaboodle somewhere else... listings and all, just the feedback stays behind. Tor is still there, Bitcoin is still there, and i hope to god that we&#039;ll (as SR) still be there.<br />I am not too certain though, at the moment. <br />

				If there is any doubt, if SR goes down, there will be a thousand more like it!<br /><br />No doubt!<br /><br />Do you all good to eyeball this open source project that is a silk road branch project...<br />https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/BitWasp<br /><br />If I were everyone on this site right now, I would get working on a project like that stat.<br /><br />Download the files.&nbsp; Comb through them very CAREFULLY..&nbsp; Make sure it&#039;s not some virus.<br /><br />But after you&#039;ve combed through it and have ruled out any moderate or major security risks, start working on deploying such a market on your own.<br /><br />See this site for a list of other market places, incase you are unaware of the alternatives that are already out there.<br /><br />http://pastebin.com/5FdAZBWS<br /><br />This is a host that will host your .onion based site<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/<br /><br />These are our alternatives.&nbsp; Yes if SR went down, some of these alternatives that people switched to will be CIA run.&nbsp; No doubt.<br /><br />So be careful of where you drop information.&nbsp; Maybe use IRC servers and encrypt your bits as an alternative in the mean time, and maybe into the future.<br /><br />But the escrow service and the popularity of that site would be a terrible loss.<br /><br />So lets hope for the best, and prepare for the worst.

				The BMR site is very unreliable &amp; full of scammers from what I hear. Also, the trust in Bitcoins both from a vendor/buyer point of view would be lost not to mention the BTC price plunge. I think it&#039;ll take at least a year for the market to overcome this &amp; even then many vendors would not risk buying so much new stock in bulk (many would never return to this type of business - they&#039;d be bust financially) thus prices overall would be way up. It would not be a case of a vacuum being filled from a &#039;pop up&#039; site - this is all the stuff of nightmares &amp; I don&#039;t think/feel it&#039;ll happen - SR will be back soon.

				BMR is not full of scammers, I do business there too. It just doesn&#039;t have the traffic that SR gets, so they don&#039;t put much effort. I guarantee if they got 1/10th the traffic SR gets, things would change there quickly.

				BMR is plan B. More people should be aware of this, shit.<br /><br />I mean I know it&#039;s a den of thieves right now, but it&#039;s the only site that is anywhere near the caliber of SR (they claim over there it&#039;s way better/more secure, but I have no evidence to corroborate that) and I think the SR people moving over there could really change it for the better.<br /><br />That said though I doubt SR is going down any time soon. We just need to get this server bullshit taking care of, as I&#039;m sure DPR is busting his ass to get done right now (hence him not being present at all on the forums).

				My plan B is to start drinking again. I&#039;m staying loyal to SR though, I have faith it will return. I&#039;ve been around a few months now and I can&#039;t believe how amazingly people are actually working together. I seriously expected SR to be the way everyone is saying BMR is, and I was very pleased to find out it&#039;s not at all. Sure there&#039;s some scammers and bullshit just like there is anywhere but it&#039;s far from the clusterfuck of bullshit and thievery it could be.

				I recognise everyone&#039;s anxious &amp; a bit paranoid - SRs down &amp; we can&#039;t get ahold of good weed to chill out - but seriously,<br />RELAX<br />give it a little time and either SR will come back online or you&#039;ll hear about it on the news. Nothing you can do about it either way.<br /><br />Yes there are other onion sites you can try - and go ahead, hope you have positive results - but it won&#039;t affect the SR situation &amp; all this yammering about alternatives &amp; the end of SR is just driving the paranoia count higher &amp; higher.

				Hey Guys,<br /><br />Thanks for all the replies.<br /><br />This post wasant made to make people paranoid. I am loyal to SR but we need to be mindful that one day the worst could happen here.<br /><br />There are a lot of very powerful people in powerful counties that want to see the end of this place. Granted TOR might be great technology now but technologies change and one day this place might not be.....<br /><br />I knew about BMR before I posted and was wondering if there where any others. From the replies it doesnt look to be the case.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Dontchargeme

				Why not try to get and email or other contact info for your top 3 sellers, if the road goes down then you&#039;ll still have a line to them.

				Is this what you cunts do all day?<br /><br />Sit around here talking shit.?<br /><br />Plan B is you go and visit your mum and get a cuddle, and after she tucks you in, you&nbsp; suck on your thumb with your bedroom door open and the hallway light left on ,knowing that when your step dad gets home from the bar and comes looking for some action&nbsp; it&#039;s your turn.<br /><br />

				I am tryig out the BMR http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php an it all works fine, slighly different here and there but I just fulfilled my first order and sure hope to do more. Competition is good voor de market, but when the market gets competitioon herself they start lockiing topic ans removing posts… Check out tde BMR, do’t bet everything on the ranch, these guys need to come of their high horses and come clean with the peole that made them a success… I’m focusing on setting up shop at the BMR, and you can just ask for a sellers account if oyu want… fees are 4% fixed rate… so what’s stopping you? <br />(I excppect this to be erased by one of them, they sure got time for that)<br />
