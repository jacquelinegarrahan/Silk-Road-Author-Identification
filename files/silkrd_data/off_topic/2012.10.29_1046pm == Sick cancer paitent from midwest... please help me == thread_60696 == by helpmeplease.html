				Im sorry if this is a true story, but this is NOT the place to beg and ask for donations.<br />ask for donations IRL and then use that to buy BTC and buy weed.<br /><br />If i knew you IRL and this were true, I would donate to you.<br /><br />I don&#039;t personally believe you.. But I live by 1 code on SR....<br /><br /><br />Trust no one.<br /><br />

				i have read fantastic reports of THC 9-delta being used as anti-cancer medicine.<br /><br />there is a crazy canadian called Marc Boyer who has lymphoma and uses his own homegrown to treat his cancer. this is his method. I dont have cancer and cannot voice for this, but thought i&#039;d share.<br />to turn the THC in your weed into this strange molecule you must acquire a few ounces, a few &#039;bake in the oven bags&#039; the kind you put turkeys and joints of meat to roast in.<br />you grind your dope to dust, place it in these bags with the twizzle at the top tied as tightly as you can with all the air removed.<br />this allows the THC to become heated without oxygen, it will not degrade and doesn&#039;t combust.<br /><br />use this for cannabutter and following this = medibles.

				wow TP, that sounds pretty good, even for those of us who don&#039;t (as far as we know) have cancer!<br /><br />how long and and what temperature do you cook your weed in the roasting bag to get it converted to c-butter?<br /><br />and those bags are GREAT for cooking birds as well, it&#039;s the only way I&#039;ve cooked turkeys ever since I discovered them -- crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and only takes about 3 hours for a 10-12 pound bird!<br /><br />those bags come two to a box IIRC, one for the turkey and one for your weed, lol! ;)<br /><br />

A majority of communication is non-verbal. And that&#039;s how humans read if someone is lying or not. Since it&#039;s so easy to lie online (because there are no &#039;tells&#039;), a lot of people take advantage of this and make posts such as yours. If you&#039;re telling the truth, I feel for ya man, and hope everything turns out well for you. But you cannot really blame people for becoming jaded to scams and outright lies, when it&#039;s a regular problem in this arena. Wish you well, and take the previous poster&#039;s advice and call some of those toll-free numbers they listed. Take care.

				Seeing all of OP&#039;s replies has made my initial decision to come here and help, slowly disappear...<br /><br />Who is going to donate to someone lashing out like this and making a big scene and being so rude?<br /><br />I think someone who was truly sick and saw all the posts saying, we would just like more proof before we help you, would instead reply with something like &quot;okay, give me some time, I will send you some paper work&quot; (his name and personal info could be blacked out.. but his diagnosis and date could be shown..)<br /><br />If you are a scammer, shame on you.&nbsp; What a sad and miserable life you must have; clearly your morality has gone down the drain.<br /><br />Regardless this is what I would do -- Go find someone that wants to document cannabis&#039; essential oils curing cancer...<br /><br />Heard of Rick Simpson?&nbsp; -- This man essentially makes hash oil and suggests that you consume 60 grams worth of oil over 30-60 days to cure cancer... eating about 0.1-0.2g a day and upping the dose every 5-10 days or when you feel you can handle more...<br /><br />Although I am sure that whoever is willing to donate you a pound worth of bud to turn into 50-70 grams of concentrated oil is going to want to see paperwork...<br /><br />Check out &quot;Run From The Cure&quot; on Youtube...<br /><br />Cannabinoids can cure cancer.&nbsp; Researchers believe cannabinoids destroy cancer cells via Apoptosis and Autophagy... <br /><br />

				I knew of a person who actually did just that, he did have cancer too. Jumped in front of a semi <br />Rip 3:15 <br /><br /><br />To the original poster, if you can&#039;t see how this may come off as fishy then really, then that is really strange ::) . <br /><br />If you really are going through all that you say you are. Then I believe there&#039;s a good chance you&#039;ll get what your looking for, but maybe not here.&nbsp; <br /><br />*depressing sigh <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Totally Bearpaw/perky whatever.<br /><br />Why on earth would someone lie about cancer?&nbsp; If we had been given proof I was going to donate whatever I have leftover after paying a friend back.&nbsp; Hell, I would have probably mailed a card and a care package with warm clothes for the winter and shoes and little baked goodies and anti nausea ginger candies and whatever else an orphaned kid would need to get through the winter.<br /><br />So not cool to do that. My friend works with pediatric cancer cases and it is heartbreaking.

				Yeah, it is a different animal here on SR.&nbsp; I still like it though.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t like this kind of thing doesn&#039;t happen all the time on other sites, it just happens much more frequently here.<br /><br />There are a ton of really whacked out women on mom websites, pretending their kid needs an operation, trying to get money.&nbsp; Or who write about how they don&#039;t even have enough money to get the heat turned on and they are all sleeping in the living room, huddled together for heat, and that the baby is the only one they can afford to feed.&nbsp; They usually are busted as liars when someone connects their profile pic to a facebook account of a very well to do family in a huge McMansion....I guess maybe mommy needed some money for her H and is trying to keep it a secret?&nbsp; &nbsp;:P Some of these women post pictures of their kids and themselves and a few months after the join it comes out that they are just bored women who are trying to escape by creating a fantasy life they were using some obscure former models or athletes pictures off her Facebook page. Making up fantastical stories about their lives...just really strange messed up people everywhere.
