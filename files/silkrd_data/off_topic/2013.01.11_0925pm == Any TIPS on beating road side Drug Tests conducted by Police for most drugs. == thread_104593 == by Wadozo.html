				Road side Drug Tests can be used to detect cannabis, ecstacy and meth/speed in my part of the world. Not sure about heroin, but cocaine is a drug not able to be tested for at the moment with road side test kits (yet). Just wondering if anyone had any tips, tricks or ideas on how to avoid testing positive? Looking forward to reading and learning about what methods people use (if any) to prevent or minimize the chance of returning a positive result. I realize different drugs stay in your system for different lengths of time, but is there any way to avoid detection or is it more like a cross your fingers and pray type of thing? :)

				They say 4 days for ecstasy and meth/speed and up to 30 days for cannabis. Everyone is different of course but they are the figures provided by the manufacturer of the test kits.

				It seems odd to be able to detect mary-jane in your saliva beyond a couple of hours since saliva isn&#039;t really an excretory substance in your body, that is, not to excrete waste like piss. Don&#039;t know for sure, though...

				Interesting thread... I think the fact the saliva is a bodily fluid means it can likely contain traces of whatever is in ya body at the time the saliva is being produced... but then I wouldn&#039;t have a scientific clue either. <br /><br />I would think a mouthwash type thing sounds most plausible, something that would dilute your saliva just prior to point of test, diluted to the point that the bulk of what is being tested is the &#039;mouthwash&#039;.&nbsp; Be good if we could get it in mini caps, then we could carry them on us when driving and pop one in our mouth to crush as soon as we saw the blue disco lights ahead!&nbsp; Is that plausible?... no, probably not... maybe i shouldn&#039;t have had that pipe for lunch!<br /><br />Anyway, like I said, interesting thread, thank you I will keep watching.

It&#039;s the same rule for alcohol infringements where if you refuse, your charged with refusal to give a sample which is worse than a high range charge.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip hands off black 7. +1 for you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Road side Drug Test kits have been around for a while now and are slowly becoming more prevalent (fuck!). :&#039;(<br /><br />pbody88, I&#039;m only going off the manufacturer&#039;s figures regarding the 30 days for cannabis. It does seem like an aweful long time, but 30 days would be a one off for someone in this world. Apparently, THC takes a long time for the body to break down compared with other illicit substances and remains in your system for longer periods of time. The initial swab test is only an indicator. If it shows a positive result, a second more thorough test is carried out in the bus with a professional, calibrated Drug testing machine capable of detecting a lot more. To top it off, your sample is then sent away for further lab testing to confirm the result. It&#039;s probably more like 15 days for your average cannabis user as apposed to 30 days IMO. Just to clarify, there&#039;s no level of intoxication you need to reach to be charged. All the test has to show is an indication of drugs in your system, unlike alcohol where there is a safe limit to stay below.&nbsp; :)

				In my part of the world, Police use a saliva swab test where the driver slides the test along their tongue. A 5 minute wait is all it takes for the results to show. If that&#039;s a positive result, a second test with a much more sophisticated machine is done where the driver has a test &quot;strip&quot; which they place under their tongue, protruding out of their mouth while leaning their head forward (eyes looking down) as this helps with saliva production. Then for confirmation, the test strip is sent to a lab for further testing. A 3 stage process in total.

				I don&#039;t think He only means if you drive while still under the influence of drugs.&nbsp; In America a person can be tested on site for drugs and there&#039;s no way for them to verify that the drugs are currently intoxicating the person or whether they were consumed days ago.&nbsp; If there are drugs in a persons system the are guilty of a DUID(Driving Under the Influence of Drugs).&nbsp; If they refuse the on site test, they are automatically guilty of a DUID.&nbsp; It DOES NOT have to be proven in court any more..

				I have some ideas on how to beat this.&nbsp; Can anyone point to the specific brand that is being used? These tests usually involve complex molecules on the strip for detecting the compound, usually immunoassay using immobilized enzymes.&nbsp; You just need to find a non-harmful chemical which will denature this fragile compound or interfere.&nbsp; Put that into a gel cap type thing and sell them for 20$ a pop.&nbsp; Maybe even a drastic pH change will work?

				Swabs are pretty much useless unless you smoked right before the test (at least the one I was required to take). Unless you&#039;re a heavy user who decided to smoke same day, you should be fine.
