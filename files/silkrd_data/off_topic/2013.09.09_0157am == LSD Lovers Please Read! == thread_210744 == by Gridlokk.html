				I&#039;ve wondered on a few occasions. Is it just me or doesn&#039;t it seem disrespectful to lay 25x NBOME&#039;s on grateful dead blotters? Seriously, i think Jerry would roll over in his grave if he only knew that beautiful blotter art with Dancing Bears and the Steal Your Face logo is being tainted with RC&#039;s<br /><br />thoughts?

				For real! It&#039;s bullshit, and never more so then with Hoffmans. There&#039;s a vendor who lays A-LAD (I think it&#039;s called) and LSZ on blotters that actually say A-LAD/ LSZ on every tab so it can&#039;t get passed off as something else.

The first thing i would think after seeing either of those blotter arts would be &quot;LSD&quot;. And that would probably be the only thing i would think before eating them. Ive been seeing it more and more with these miss leading blotters. It makes it extremely difficult to know what your taking until you actually taste it, and if it does have a bitterness to it their are endless possibilities to what it is.

				Well, if you tried to put 10-20 blotters of 25i on your tongue, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d know instantly and spit it out but the question is how much already would have gotten absorbed into your mouth, I suppose.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t care for 25i.&nbsp; When I heard about the different 25x series I originally was planning to try them all just for the hell of it but I was so turned off by my two trials with 25i that I decided not to bother with the rest in the series.&nbsp; I love just about everything about LSD but 25i-NBOME, yuck.&nbsp; For me it is 4-5 hours of an unpleasant comeup phase, and then eventually it is OK feeling for the second half of the experience.&nbsp; What a waste of time.&nbsp; Also the numbness it causes in the mouth is really annoying.

Anyone who does is obviously doing so to mislead for profit threatening many peoples safety. End of Fucking Story. <br /><br />Secondly, I personally do not believe Methylone (m1, BK-MDMA, Moon Rocks) are responsible for any deaths yet. At least at festivals. I have done huge amounts of m1 and am actually a big fan of it, yes even over MDMA. i have done tons of MDMA and had a lot of fun with it, but it is just too draining and damaging to do every weekend at shows or festies. I go out a lot. I obviously do not agree with anyone selling m1 as MDMA. Methylone is much more fun for me and does not hinder my performance even after a week long binge. And it is certainly not any where near as neurotoxic as MDMA... before you jump to hit that reply button, do your research. it&#039;s a fact.<br />I personally think that these deaths were a result of a much better quality MDMA showing up at these festivals. I have been on this scene for many many years. For a long time, years and years, most of the molly on lot has been a bit watered down. People are used to having to take extra... again, profit motive. Suddenly, There is a flood of very high quality MDMA on Lot. This is normally a good thing, but too much MDMA will easily kill a few people at a hot festival. Used to hear about it all the time 15-20 years ago when Molly got real big, which is probably why dealers started to water it down. to get the heat off them.<br /><br />Just a theory of mine. I&#039;m just tired of Methylone getting a bad rep, Someone needs to stand up for it. Fucking love my &#039;Lone, you leave it it alone!

Though I doubt he would condone it and see it as a shortcut, I bet he would not feel disrespected. <br /><br />As to any RC on GD blotter is blasphemy, and hoffmans are a malicious act. These prints are made with RC on them so people can pass them off as LSD and they give my favorite compound a very bad name. <br /><br />White on white is the only way to go now imho. You get an idea of how clean it is, its easy to see reagent results, and as a crude replacement for reagent testing, a blacklight can be used as lsd glows under blacklight. And there is no chance someone it will be &quot;bitter from the ink&quot; - i guess this is possible but I want my acid to taste like nothing, as it should.<br /><br />Jerry Bear would be rolling in his grave aout these fake blotters... but I think he would be ecstatic about the renissance with LSD and the new generation of chemists finding new and brilliant ways to synthesize the compound we all love so much. Not to mention the Silk Road, the excellent vendors selling quality L on here are doing him proud every day.<br /><br />^.^

But, I do know people die from taking MDMA and it is more frequent than we lead ourselves to believe. Just a few months ago a good friend of mine who knows his chemistry and drugs, gave some MDMA to his friend that absolutely was real MDMA. He accidentally took too much right in front of my friend without him even realizing it. Apparently, my friend dumped out about a gram on the table and told his friend to help himself not thinking that he would eat as much as he did.... My friend was preoccupied with some lady friends while his friend was sitting there with the mound. After some time my friend poked his head up to see how his buddy was doing and noticed that nearly half of the gram was gone. Now, what I am about to say is true and this is not some scare tactic or some bullshit. This is what I know to be what happened that night. His friend started rolling very hard but not in a good way. they did everything right. They induced vomiting while trying to keep him hydrated, tried to keep his body temp down etc. Eventually they rushed him to the ER. He said by the time he got there he had turned blue. The ER for some reason had been going through renovations and so they had the entrance blocked or some shit so it took extra time to get him to the help he needed... the final result was the kid dying in my buddies arms while trying to carry him into the hospital. This is no joke. And it hit close to home and since then I have been a lot more careful about who I give MDMA to. I also pre-measure doses for everyone I buy MDMA for. I make the doses no more than 80mg which should be adequate for good molly. <br /><br />Now, honestly. Can you see some girl who knows nothing about chemistry or dosing MDMA at a hot festival taking a couple extra pills or dips killing herself at a festival? I certainly can. Especially if they dont keep themselves properly hydrated. Have you ever been to a festival like E zoo? These girls walk around and eat drugs all weekend and always have a can of beer in their hand. I rarely ever see people drink water at these things. I am constantly telling people to drink water... I am always getting that &quot;what a square&quot; look from people cause I turn down beer for water.<br /><br />So yes I personally do believe these deaths were from real MDMA and it is very much possible. but again... just a theory and I am not saying I know anything for sure. And I am not putting MDMA down, I have always had a love for it... But let&#039;s be fucking honest with ourselves here, it is not as safe as we lead ourselves to believe, especially in the hands of inexperienced or foolish users. that being said, let me just say that also MDMA can be very safe in the RIGHT hands. ya know, it&#039;s like anything else.

I would like to know the deal on it. Been a pretty big mystery to me since it happened.... how the fuck did 25i get past my better knowing... anyone interested in taking it off my hands for further examination and testing?

I wish I weren&#039;t actually. If I had any doubt in my mind I wouldnt have had to tell this guy he had spent his money on garbage. I really didn&#039;t want to have that conversation, no one wants to be told their shit is garbage and they got beat, and I have love and respect for this guy. I have had a lot of experience with 25i and would know it each and every time. But yeah like I said I have some still, I certainly would like to know if it has a taste at least and maybe i just missed it.... but I am not gonna try it to see. Don&#039;t blame anyone else for not wanting it either, but if anyone knows how to test shit properly to see whats up it would be nice to know... i dunno maybe they did something different to it to eliminate the taste.... could be useful info for the community if that is happening now.<br />

				At least using a NIK (field reagent test) kit will tell you definitively that the blotter contains LSD, I doubt anybody laying real lucy would ruin such expensive product by mixing in nbome. Since most nbome fakes are sold to make fat profits mixing in lucy would be pointless.<br /><br />To be certain that the only thing present is L you could get really good at thin layer chromatography, or apparently the Netherlands has a program where they will test samples sent to them free of charge and results can be obtained over the phone, anonymously. <br /><br />But the NIK kits are good enough for my piece of mind, seriously gonna test every batch I get from now on. Thanks again for the info.

BUT its funny you bring that up. I had some blotter that was mixed with both, apparently. supposedly there was a vendor in NL selling really weak hits of L that i guess he tried to beef up a little. I dont remember his name, I&#039;ll have to look it up but that was the word I heard.... no idea if it&#039;s true and doesnt seem likely. But I had those hits and I had a hard time deciding if it was L or 25i. Which really shook me up for a while cause it made me doubt my ability to know the difference. I had them about 6 months ago I think. i just remember it being really strange, had me really confused until I read about someone figuring out there was 25i on them at least, may have been mixed with something other than lsd too, who knows.
