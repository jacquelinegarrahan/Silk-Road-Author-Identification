				upon tripping, i often imagine myself in different manifestations throughout the span of human history, especially when looking into the mirror. sort of like looking at all the seeds which have constituted my current being. isnt it weird/eerie how our era is just another speckle in the timeline of humanity when taking a completely extrospective outlook? i dont know exactly what i want to express by this, but im sure people of past generations thought they were part of a unique period of time. Not saying that each historic period doesnt have its own unique flavor/ethos/aura, but to think of being exceptional or extraordinary is just the ego talking imo. and theres nothing wrong with that. to acknowledge commonality brings about alienation in a way, and thats no fun. i sort of distract myself from these thoughts because i dont like thinking of being part of nothing spectacular or groundbreaking, but has anyone else here felt this way?

				Well I hate to send bad vibes your way but We are kind of special! As far as we now have the ability to destroy all mankind and are actions, right now are leading to extinction. I don&#039;t think they could turn global warming around if they even wanted too.....so there&#039;s something to ponder? The Movie &quot;Children Of Men&quot; that&#039;s the future......Thanks Monsanto for the GMO&#039;s, We certainly won&#039;t have to worry about feeding everyone if there&#039;s no one left to feed.....

				I Think I get where your coming from and I appreciate your point of view......I hate mine. But I still believe it. I mean if we manage to somehow climb out of this environmental catastrophic event we&#039;ve created?&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe the world is going to end in my lifetime or anything? but I&#039;m amazed at all the history my son has already seen. And there&#039;s harsh lives! And there&#039;s HARSH LIVES depending on your geography. Say a N.Korean prison labor camp. I hope we all just eventually die off without taking this beautiful planet with us..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah dude, one time I was high and it blew my mind when I realised that guys were getting blowjobs back in the Roman times.<br /><br />I was like, OH SHIT.. they were real fucking people that existed in time, thinking their life was everything and important, and now noone gives a fuck. Just like how they will think of us in 100 years. It blows me away to think that people will actually exist in 100,000 years (environment yeah yeah). <br /><br />But I get you, we all have a real lineage that goes back to the dawn of life itself. We all have a tree leading up to us.. It&#039;s just a shame we aren&#039;t living a bit further into the future. Our descendents in 100,000 years will be able to see their family tree perfectly due to the digital/information age. <br /><br />I think one thing we have lost is our sense of magic about life. I mean now, there&#039;s explanations for almost everything. Complex life? Evolution. Stars, gravity, electromagnetism, diseases, etc etc. We know a lot about the earth and therefore it seems very habitual to live in this world with our cars, roads, money, computers etc.<br /><br />But back in the day people didn&#039;t know SHIT. For someone like Darwin, he was just born, and if he asked the question &quot;where did all these animals come from?&quot; - noone had a fucking clue. The best guess was just &quot;God&quot;. So I think people had more of a sense of the what the fuckness of actually living in this universe, and more passion to find out about it. Whereas now you&#039;re just born, you go to school, you eat some fucking food and you go to sleep and noone asks/cares about these questions anymore, because they just aren&#039;t as real.

Obvs we&#039;re on a drug forum so naturally most people here will be into different ways of thoughts<br /><br />I agree, with the theories of dark matter etc and the problems with unifying quantum gravity with weak/strong/electromagnetism etc we are becoming more and more knowledgable about little we know, but I think is different to say that there aren&#039;t as obvious mysteries today. For example as guy said animals etc, they are everywhere so if we didnt kno how they came to be we would ask that Q more often, but most ppl never think about the quantum/even comprehend
