				Hi guys, in 2 weeks I will celebrate my anniversary and just can&#039;t decide what to get. <br />That is what the germans call : &quot;Die Qual der Wahl&quot; thanks to SR :)<br /><br />So I love Mephedrone, but I don&#039;t like normal Amphetamines, so is Meth more like Mephedrone or Amphetamine, some say that Meth is just like Meph but with the longer duration?Many say that meth is best suited as a work stim but not so for partying.<br /><br />If I get Meth I will also get Meph as well, I read somewhere that they can make a nice combo, any experiences?(won&#039;t the meth owerpower the mephedrone?)<br /><br />P.S : If I were to get a g of Coke would it last an entire evening or would I run out in the middle of it?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Meth would keep you going all night and the next day, a G of coke would last the night easy... You&#039;d be able to give a few lines away... Would be lots of fun... I&#039;d personally suggest the coke, but if you really want to party you could mix it up!

				I&#039;ve only snorted and parachuted meth, but it felt like a really strong amphetamine to me. I could certainly see myself having fun at a party with it- bit of empathy, desire to move around, etc. Just make sure you have the next day...or two... off of work or whatever you do.<br /><br />I always suggest MDMA for parties, though. Nothing beats the feeling of ecstasy in an environment of flashing lights, lots of music, and people to fall in love with :)
