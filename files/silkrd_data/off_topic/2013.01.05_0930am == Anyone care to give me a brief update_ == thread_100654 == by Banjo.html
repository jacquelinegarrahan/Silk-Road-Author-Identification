				I&#039;ve been away for a while, and obviously a lot of things have changed around here. So, would anyone care to answer a couple questions for me? I&#039;m not looking to rehash debates, or have yet another thread full of theories about what&#039;s going/went on.<br /><br />Why are all the moderators gone? (Or appear to be so)<br />What was this &quot;November debacle&quot; I&#039;ve seen several references to?<br />There are a lot of references to the effect of, &quot;A lot of weird shit has been going on&quot;. What specifically?<br /><br />Just the facts please, or, &quot;no one knows&quot; if that&#039;s the case.

				The main things are that SR went down for some time and then it got hacked. Part of the image hack is still in effect. If you see any listings on SR that say quickbuy on the picture then the picture has been hacked. These things prompted mass hysteria to the effect of, &quot;holy shit we can&#039;t trust anyone SR is being run by charles Manson, the FBI, Scotland yard, and the boogie man.&quot; Many people left to not come back. Randomly as of late most mods disappeared. Theories flew around, but questions were never answered. For the moment everything is calm. Then again, it is always calmest before war.
