				Well the only way anything will actually happen is by self fulfilling prophecy.. &quot;It&#039;s 2012.. Therefore X is happening!&quot; and by virtue of thinking that, we come together to affect some kind of change.<br /><br />But ultimately there is no distinction in these moments passing right now, or the moments of going from 1761 to 1762, or the moments going from 5001 to 5002. The calendar is just a human invention. So no, the world will not end. Stars will continue to burn and explode, humans will be born and die, technology will advance, all the usual trials and tribulations.<br /><br />And it doesn&#039;t really mean anything that the Mayans noticed that there is some kind of astronomical alignment on that date, considering they couldn&#039;t even predict the downfall of their own civilisation, let alone thousands of years into the future.<br /><br />All that will happen is that all the people who bought into this 2012 stuff will retreat back online to find solace in their false consolations together, without ever really considering how full of shit they actually are.

				I don&#039;t think anything is going to happen.. But the Mayans didn&#039;t include leap year because they counted a year as ~325.245 days. Thus excluding the need for a &quot;leap year&quot;, meaning that 21/12/12 is the correct date.

				While i don&#039;t really believe in any of the mythological stuff about 2012, i can&#039;t deny the fact that shit is gonna hit the fan somewhat soon. <br /><br />Overtime we&#039;ve seen civil unrest slowly building, even people like my conservative parents are saying things aren&#039;t going well, so things are either going to have to change, or it&#039;ll eventually boil over...<br /><br />Either way i&#039;ll have a nice drug collection for when the time comes

				Dude all living things are completely screwed... havent you heard with the celestial alignment the earths poles will reverse which hasnt occurred since the invention of electronic devices, and if you know anything about physics and magnetic fields moving past a wire will induce a current, blowing all of the transformer substations and completely destroying all closed electronic circuits on earth... which will take years to fix, not to mention all your thoughts and movements are is electrochemical equilibrium dancing across a membrane, initiating these same currents along conductive linear paths which produce and are subject to the same external magnetic fields (ever heard of transcranial magnetic stimulation?) when the poles reverse everyones going to get a nice little jolt of current flowing through all their axons, probably stopping their heart and frying the central processing unit. Gonna be fun fun fun to flop around like a fish out of water<br /><br />I dont even think 2012 is about the end of the world or doomsday, but more of a rebirth or awakening. Reading true hallucinations by mckenna as they went psychotic consuming so many shrooms was an interesting perspective on the 2012 deal, though it just made me think he was still out of his mind.<br /><br />shit definitely is going to hit the fan though sometime soon, just in regards to the american economy and things like social security and everything else that is failing... I honestly expect major changes in the world in the next few years, but certainly do not believe the doomsday prophecies, maybe the world as we know it will end, but not the physical world...<br /><br />i always try to live as if today is my last, so that I am appreciative of every moment... everyone should try to make sure to enjoy the next months just in case.&nbsp; but I too have my doomsday supply of drugs to welcome in the new world and then go out with a warm rush if it comes to that. gonna be a great excuse to finally embrace the needle

				I&#039;ve taken a pledge, and I strongly encourage you all to take it with me:<br /><br />After December 21, 2012, I will NEVER listen to, propagate, or otherwise acknowledge any &quot;end of the world&quot; theory ever again.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve lived through killer bees, y2k, bird flu, swine flu, the rapture of 2011, etc. and god dammit, 2012 is the last one.&nbsp; I get it, everyone secretly wants the world to end because it means you don&#039;t have to think about solving the worlds problems or doing anything with your life, but guess what.......ITS NOT GOING TO END ANY TIME SOON.&nbsp; life is long, and you&#039;re gonna have to live all of it so buck up and take responsibility for this place.<br /><br />last i checked we&#039;ve got access to the same entheogens that the mayans had AND we have more sophisticated physical tools...so I checked with the drugs and the most I got was &quot;this is a time of great change.&quot;&nbsp; well no shit; you&#039;d have to be an complete idiot with your head stuck 2 feet up your ass to not realize that now is a time of great change.&nbsp; this DOES NOT mean that the world is going to just *poof* end on 12/21/2012.<br /><br />seriously, please consider taking my pledge and telling your friends about it

				Everyone needs to see 2012 Time for Change with Daniel Pinchbeck, which kind of outlines the prophecies that exist that surround the time we are in, and the documentary explores human solutions to our problems.&nbsp; We are like a caterpillar in the chrysalis... it is a delicate period where we could end in ruin or emerge as a being with wings.&nbsp; This is what 2012 is all about.&nbsp; Will evil reign or will good prevail?&nbsp; They say that &quot;well we killed more people in the 20th century than we did in the 10th century so it&#039;s not getting better&quot; but the truth is that we had a lot more regret about it. We are beginning to yearn for the understanding of the underpinnings of why we do the things we do.&nbsp; <br /><br />In evolutionary standards, we are at the pinnacle.&nbsp; The human being is indeed extraordinarily special.&nbsp; We have reached a point of evolution that does not have to be carried out on the biological level.&nbsp; We have entered conscious evolution.<br /><br />We truly are becoming the gods our ancestors dreamed of.&nbsp; Imagine talking to your friend 1000 years ago, saying &quot;how crazy it would be if you could not only speak to someone on the other side of the planet, but see them while you do it.&quot;&nbsp; We do this kind of thing every day now.&nbsp; We are going to merge with technology (the singularity, maybe?).&nbsp; That isn&#039;t a theory- it is already happening.&nbsp; We are designing microbots that will be capable of supplying oxygen to your blood cells and repairing damaged cells to keep you alive... indefinitely.&nbsp; The question is, will our ethics and good nature keep pace with the power of our inventions?&nbsp; HG Wells writes that &quot;history is a race between education and catastrophe.&quot;&nbsp; I am of the belief that our good intentions will overcome.&nbsp; This is a one-shot deal, and our actions will be judged.
