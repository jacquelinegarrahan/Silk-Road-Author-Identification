				I looked everywhere and couldn&#039;t get a clear answer on what the tolerance for 25i-NBOMe was...<br /><br />Does anyone know?&nbsp; I took it Monday night (500 ug) and was wanting to do it again on Friday with my brother when we go to the beach, but I wanted to make sure I&#039;d be able to trip again.&nbsp; Yes, I understand that doing psychedelics often isn&#039;t entirely healthy for someone&#039;s mental health, but I wouldn&#039;t normally take them this close together, so I&#039;m not too worried about it...

				Bump. I&#039;m curious about this as well... there is virtually no literature online about 25i-NBOMe. Perhaps ENBOOM will see this and enlighten us?

Do you know if 1500ug would be safe dose, ENBOOM? I would really like to try a bit more; however, my muscles started clenching up during the come down from my 1000ug trip. I feel like the trip may be worth it, though, and maybe a little bud and/or muscle relaxers can ease the clenching for me. Whatdoya think?<br /><br />EDIT: I am asking more as a, I am probably going to try 3 hits because I want to see what the next level of tripping on this has to offer and want to know if you have any reason to believe that taking more than 2 hits (1000ug) is a bad idea.

At one point, I was talking to this chick and went from being completely apathetic towards her to hating her to loving her in a matter of minutes. Imo, it is definitely one to try. I do not know if I will trip on this as frequently as I do acid, but I guess I need a few more experiences to see just how much I like it. If my muscles don&#039;t clench up next time, I will be a lot more likely to duet a few more times.
