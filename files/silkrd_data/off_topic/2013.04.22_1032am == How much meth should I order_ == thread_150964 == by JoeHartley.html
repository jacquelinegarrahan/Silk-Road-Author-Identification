				Ok, so I&#039;ve never tried methamphetamine before but today is the day I shall place an order for some. I&#039;m debating between 200mg from the UK vendor &#039;reich&#039;, or 500mg from the Ukrainian vendor &#039;trip2012&#039;, however as I&#039;ve never done meth before I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll enjoy it or not so I don&#039;t know which to order. The 500mg from trip2012 is, from what I gather by reading reviews, better quality then reich&#039;s meth, and it&#039;s also cheaper per mg; I just don&#039;t want to end up with half a gram of meth which I&#039;m not enjoying.<br /><br />Could some of the more experienced tweakers out there give me their advice; is meth a drug which everyone instantly loves (as many describe it to be), or is there a real chance that someone won&#039;t enjoy it. I personally love cocaine, MDMA and amphetamine if that has any relevance to whether I&#039;d like meth or not. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />- JH

				If you like amphetamine there&#039;s a good chance you&#039;ll like meth, as long as you&#039;re fine with being awake for a very long time after using it. I personally tried meth a few times and found it too long lasting and rough on my body, but I had no problem holding onto the gram I had and saving it for getting housework and tedious school stuff done (oral) and keeping me going at music festivals (nasal). It&#039;s a useful substance that can be good to have around even if you aren&#039;t a huge fan.

				Ok great thanks Snark. I&#039;ll just order the 1/2g and if I don&#039;t like it I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be able to move it on to someone else. I&#039;m planning to use it primarily as a study aid, but also to just try out. <br /><br />Any suggestions as to whether I should try oral, nasal or smoking as the ROA for my future first dose?<br />- JH

				Start with 1g.&nbsp; If you get 500mg and you end up liking it, you&#039;re going to be pissed you only have 500mg.&nbsp; Anything over a G and you may be in for a looong ride.

				Snark hit that on the head. I get about .25-.5 of a gram, every few weeks or so, aside from half grams i use for my friends MDxx rolls.<br /><br />The quarter and half grams i buy for personal use, go so fucking far, as i only use them for work, or in any instance when i need to be up and ready to rock for long periods of time.<br /><br />The shit can be great, but it can be equally as terrible. <br /><br />Start small, like realll small, no more than 50mg for your first line. I personally never need more than 30-60mg per use. Good luck dude.

				Order the best value one. If you like amphetamine you will like methamphetamine. <br />If I were you I would snort 20mg to start with. IMO 50mg is too much to start with. remember, it&#039;s better to smart small and top up if you want more than taking too much and having an unpleasant 12+ hours.<br /><br />Also keep in mind it is far more addictive and potent than amphetamine, so be careful with how frequently you use it.

				If you have an addictive personality or addictive + too much free time on your hands, steer fucking clear of it and just stick with MDA/MDMA/Coke<br /><br />Seen too many fuckers&#039; lives ruined by meth. Good mates, some switched on mates. Just be fucking smart, and just because it&#039;s there, doesn&#039;t mean you need to smoke/snort/shelf it.<br /><br />I, personally, am terrified of meth, just from what it&#039;s slowly done to a lot of my mates.<br /><br />Then again, there are some functioning meth-heads out there, the nightclub duty-managers who are skinny as fuck and REALLY hyper-active, or the businessmen with sunken cheeks that work 25-hour days.<br /><br />Just take some Aderall, mang, or some ritalin. Meth just seems like a big fucking step for a &quot;study-aide&quot;

				It&#039;s not particularly exaggerating either. My friends were literally poster-boys from the before/after mug shots of before meth/after meth.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the drug destroying your body, it&#039;s the activities you undertake while you&#039;re on meth: Scratching blackheads constantly, drinking nothing but soft drinks because water tastes like shit, never eating anything except more meth, staying awake for days at a time, some extreme cases even a week at a time, doing other drugs as well during the high, drinking heaps of alcohol because it doesn&#039;t get you drunk anymore, smoking cigarettes like a chimney...<br /><br />All these things put together makes you a fucking ugly human being, and it shows within weeks if you&#039;re a regular user.<br /><br />Just ... Be smart, for fucks sake.

				you get quarter gram per person and you make sure everybody has something like 2 xanax&#039;s for the next 2 nights of sleep. 1 xanax per night<br /><br />the amount you need of meth depends of how u use it as you will likely waste that quarter gram if your a newbie smoking it, but its too much to swallow or use rectally. the latter two you&#039;d have about a point (100grams) or less. body weight is also a factor if ur a chunk u need more than a skinny<br /><br />also dont try it again for a while.. even if its a failure.
