				Approximately 3.37 times more risky.<br /><br />No, but really, packages going through customs are definitely scrutinized more carefully, so it&#039;s probably technically more dangerous (the best kind of dangerous!).&nbsp; Purchasing from a top vendor should leave you with few worries, though.&nbsp; SR vendors successfully send shipments through customs all the time.

				I used to get so much stuff sent from overseas, but these days I am way too paranoid to do that.&nbsp; A lot of it depends on the country it&#039;s coming from, but at the end of the day it all goes through customs. <br /><br />If it&#039;s something like acid or a few prescription drugs it&#039;s easy to get through, but something that can be picked up on by the dogs scares the shit out of me.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				All the stuff I order from Canada comes in a timely fashion (5-8 days). But Netherlands sometimes takes a bit long. waiting 13 days right now for some goods.
