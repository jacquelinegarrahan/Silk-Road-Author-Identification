				Happy New Year, let me start by saying.<br /><br />Okay, so I&#039;m a pothead, I smoke daily, at least right now, and kind of &quot;need&quot; to or I get very...down <br /><br />So right now I&#039;m smoking resin and synthetic, both of which not great for the health and neither holds a torch to the real green.<br /><br />So, as you may have seen in the &quot;UK Shipping&quot; thread, a LOT of us Brits are still waiting on orders, some for over 5 weeks!<br /><br />I ordered 10g of PowerPlant from an Amsterdam seller but it was shipped from Belgium <br /><br />It was left in the post office on Monday the 5th of December<br /><br />It is currently Monday 2nd and a Bank Holiday (no post)<br /><br />Now, I have 19.01 BTC, Would have been 30 BTC if not for a certain pos seller HepaAir<br /><br />Anyway, I digress <br /><br />Should I order more right now? there aren&#039;t really any great UK Sellers right now<br /><br />But ordering from Europe, seems Oxymoron, surely an order that has been sent out weeks ago is more likely to arrive before a new order placed? I really dont know what to do :( <br /><br />Because some who have waited longer than I have seemed to finally get it.. but then there&#039;s just as much chance I never will.<br /><br />Any input would be greatly appreciated.

				Shit happens man, I feel you. I dunno, if you are willing to take the loss if something does happen to the order then I would say go ahead.

				I&#039;m in the UK and have been waiting on 3 orders since around the 9-10th of december mate, 1 order has arrived the other two haven&#039;t. <br /><br />I have kept delaying extending the resolution date again and again to give the 2 sellers a chance (these are 2 very respectable sellers that i don&#039;t want to cause grief)<br /><br />bare in mind however that postal cutoff was 20 dec for royal mail i think and they only just started resuming deliveries last wednesday which I imagine they still have a ton of stuff to deliver.<br /><br />basically, what I&#039;m going to do is extend til friday and if I get nothing then, then i&#039;ll start on resolution process e.t.c and if it does arrive I will give back any refund I receive.

				I&#039;m nearing a month on one of my international orders. I think mail is just really slow this time of year. Someone&#039;s package took 30 days to get from Canada to the US which is crazy. Give it another week before writing it off as lost, confiscated, or not sent.
