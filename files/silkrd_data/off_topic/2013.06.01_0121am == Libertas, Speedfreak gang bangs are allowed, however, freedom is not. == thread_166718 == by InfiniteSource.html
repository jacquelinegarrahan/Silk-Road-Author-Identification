The first user claimed to have &quot;never got the package&quot; but when I produced tracking he said the post office &quot;put it in the wrong box,&quot; this pissed him off so he told everyone I sent a privnot. Im guess another person saw this as a opportunity to jump in and get free drugs, and tried to pull the same.

				SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would probably be because you have been locked out pending an investigation. I am quite amazed you would have the audacity to request a pass phrase reset as it goes.<br /><br />Scammers are not tolerated on SR, if you open another vendor account and we find it we will ban that one too.<br /><br />~SR Support<br /><br /><br /><br />Sounds like im already guilty, so no need for &quot;a pending investigation.&quot; Quite the totalitarian control you have. Reminds me a lot of the US government. Leading up to the days before I was locked out, who claimed I scammed them? Of course you have people speaking up now, because I can&#039;t even get into the account to ship orders correctly. Its ridiculousness that I don;t even get a a chance to present my side! what kind of justice system is this? Its not justice, its a god damn monarchy<br />~InfiniteSource1<br /><br /><br />I have funds in that account which I own; orders which were finalized. This does not belong to you. I attempted to refund bitcoins for users who FE&#039;d, but I was outed in the forums and no one would even contact me to arrange a refund.&#039;&#039;<br />~InfiniteSource1<br /><br /><br />SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your right that last message was not quite correct. We already completed our investigation before banning you and you are very much guilty. It was obvious you are among a class of the most despicable and dishonest scammers that we have seen. No matter how much we manage to confiscate from you, it will pale in comparison to the enormous financial damage you have done to our users. The damage you have done to the reputation of our marketplace is enough to warrant any punishment we are capable of, all of which are much too lenient for the likes of you. You are permanently banned from selling here, and if we find out that you have opened a new vendor account we will immediately shut it down, and keep the $500 bond you pay for it.<br /><br />~SR Support<br /><br /><br />Pretty harsh for two privnotes they never even saw.<br />

I am not sure why they have become unfriendly as of late.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I locked it because InfiniteSource was threatening to release indefinable details in another thread (ask Self sovereignty) and I didn&#039;t want to risk rattling the cage any more for the safety of others. <br /><br />Raz you are just being total dick now, if you want to slag me off and blame me for everything in every thread you post in you are just going to make yourself look increasingly stupid and vindictive, knock yourself out.<br /><br />

If a honest vendor has his shop closed while SR is investigating his activity then he is making a sacrifice for the good of the community. Did their first response sound respectful or accusatory and critical? The 2nd response from SR support is full of personal attacks and emotion. None of which is necessary but it does tell much about the mindset of the author. I am looking for cool and logical, not hot and bothered. What does the 2nd to last sentence of their 2nd response even mean? Is that a threat?<br /><br />I do know of a honest vendor who was banned, later found to be innocent, and then reinstated. His name is mourid I believe, and the attacker was MTLjohn. You can read all about it here on the forums.<br /><br />I do believe in the SR and their escrow system. As a vendor I have never required FE for even a single purchase. I still trust in SR support&#039;s judgement.<br />I am not going to go so far as to say that I will blindly agree with whatever they do for all time.

It was stating that the account was being suspended until a judgement was formed, to which the vendor responded without the minimal respect or care, nor for the administrators nor for the community. If you are intelligent you don&#039;t reply to people investigating on your situation as a prick, because, as I said, respect is acquired by showing it to others, ESPECIALLY if you know you are innocent. If you are the first one to act like an imbecile why should you be treated differently from what you yourself showed you wanted to be treated as?<br /><br />We don&#039;t know the time frame of the second message, then, so we cannot know how much time it passed between the account was suspended and then banned.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166718.msg1188353#msg1188353">Quote from: farmer1 on June 01, 2013, 08:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If a honest vendor has his shop closed while SR is investigating his activity then he is making a sacrifice for the good of the community. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not just a sacrifice of the vendor. It is a sacrifice of all the community. Even the buyers are affected by a suspension of a vendor, not only the vendor himself. If the vendor is honest it is in his best interest to have the matter resolved as fast as possible and collaborate to the most of his/her power for everything to resume to normality. If you yourself instead of helping the process try to halt it at every turn are you showing interest in the community?<br /><br />And aside this, if there&#039;s a chance that a vendor can indeed be a scammer or practicing selectively scams, what you purpose to be the approach to the issue? Make them continue doing what they are doing until you don&#039;t find proof of what happened? Is this in the best interest of the community, really?

If you act as a prick it is more than logical than one will treat you as to what you show you are, i.e. a prick.

No, naturally, because you understand that the pig cannot understand words as an human. <br /><br />On the emotion side I can also agree with you, but I can get that even SR administrators are humans and can get angry at certain kind of behaviors.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166718.msg1188353#msg1188353">Quote from: farmer1 on June 01, 2013, 08:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am looking for cool and logical, not hot and bothered.

				So what is the answer to the question in the title of this post?&nbsp; I thought that FE funds were already in vendor&#039;s possession and therefore unrecoverable by SR anyway.<br /><br />What happens when a confirmed scammer gets banned while orders (non-FE) are pending?&nbsp; I would hope funds are returned to buyers.

				Quick question. All evidence supposedly was in a privnote. How did ANYONE see the evidence? What would have stopped a scamming user from making the note themselves? You took them on their word? Privnote is destroyed on first click. I demand to see cold hard facts instead of rude, personal insults. I had a 100% rating with 77 sales the day I was banned. Not one complaint until two addicts decided they needed free product. Told you I sent a privnot saying I was going to set up a bust, and you took them on that? Never even fucking asked me?<br /><br />Im telling you right now, I have never threaten anyone with police force. I sent personal details via priv note and that is all. I was taken advantage of and you all helped.<br /><br />Its apparent I was suspended by someone that allowed personal feelings to help decided my fate. I demand a review by a impartial, competent person without emotional attachment.

My view as a moderator with the interest of the future of this community in mind, however, are that threads that have devolved into 3+ pages of &quot;us against them&quot; where the members and moderators are set up to be pitted against each other are not at all beneficial to the community at large and serve only to further one particular forum member&#039;s personal agenda.<br /><br />I do think that moderators should stay as neutral as possible and back out of such threads to allow them to run their course and eventually die off (not adding fuel to the fire, so to speak), but I also understand that the urge to defend oneself against personal attacks and outright lies can be quite strong indeed.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166718.msg1188872#msg1188872">Quote from: RxKing on June 01, 2013, 11:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have stayed away from all this talk about locking threads as I talked to you personally about it after I saw you lock that vendor forum thread...and I told you that is NUTS!!

If a member feels it needs to be addressed more urgently, they are free to contact a forum moderator and we will send it up to the marketplace administrators who will address the issue.<br /><br />Regarding InfiniteSource posting your PM&#039;s and changing your words, that is not against any rules. We cannot verify whether what was said has been edited or not, so there is nothing we can do. As long as they do not release information that may threaten your security, their posts will not be edited by us.

It is a simple case of a larger volume of members here now than were here before.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166718.msg1188872#msg1188872">Quote from: RxKing on June 01, 2013, 11:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also.....<br /><br />&nbsp;I have read where you and scout are trying to defend the comments made by SR Staff to infintetcunt.And you guys should not be having to do that...as you two have nothing to do with SR&nbsp; ! It is insane people try and blame you two for what go&#039;s on at SR...I am still shocked that vendors still do not realize you two have nothing...NOTHING...to do with Silk Road..you guys(especially scout!) have said it 10000 times. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SR!! It is crazy.They should stick to blaming you two for shit you are guilty of like locking threads you should not have in the forums<br /><br />I hope you read over this thread and see where it has gone. And I wonder if Infinitidiot would ask you to lock it..if you would.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I appreciate you realising that we do not have to defend the comments made my the SR administrator that dealt with the InfiniteSource issue, and that the blame for Silk Road is often misplaced. However, we are on the front line of the community, so I do understand why they might get the wrong impression.<br /><br />Regarding locking threads, and whether this would be locked if InfiniteSource asked me to do that, again, I refer you to what I have written above.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166718.msg1188872#msg1188872">Quote from: RxKing on June 01, 2013, 11:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Harvard did a study where they interviewed people with open minds that had the rare a ability to argue and disagree and not hold a grudge. The people they interviewed were also able to totally be pissed about one thing someone did but they realized there overall body of work was great and they found that people like this were very rare. And the only fact they came away with about these people...is they have very big dicks.<br /><br />I&nbsp; want to say that other then locking threads lib...you have been an AWESOME mod. And scout you have been an awesome mod too. I come from the belief that I can totally disagree with you on something..but also support you and think you are awesome at your overall job. <br /><br />LOL<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for the kind words, and I understand where you&#039;re coming from on the issues you have brought up in your post. It is a fine line that we have to walk between chaos and order on a forum where libertarianism and freedom are the ultimate goals, and there will inevitably be decisions made by moderators who, by the very definition of the word, aren&#039;t exactly going to be the most popular people in a group or society that opposes moderation. It&#039;s not possible to please everyone here, and I do not wish to make people uncomfortable nor feel as though they have to &quot;be careful what they post lest they offend someone and have their thread locked&quot;.<br /><br />Threads will only be locked if we consider that there is a strong reason to lock them. We will continue to do our jobs whether we are criticised or applauded for it.<br /><br />Every member of this community is free to say anything that they wish as long as it does not violate the policies of this privately owned forum, namely that personal information or other information that compromises a person&#039;s anonymity may not be posted under any circumstances. That is not a moderator policy, that is a forum owner policy.<br /><br />Regarding locking threads, that will be kept to an absolute minimum. For that you can hold me to my word, and consider me personally responsible for it.<br /><br />Libertas

				The moderators have the option to lock and edit threads at their disposal. That is how the forums are setup. There is a reason. And they have the right to do whatever they would like. This is their world. Not ours. They supply us with the tools to be able to pull the things off that we do, so we must abide by what they tell us to do.

				So that&#039;s means there will NEVER be a locked thread ;)..because I have never seen or been presented with a valid, pressing, reason for doing so. And can you please unlock the thread about negging? As CLEARLY there was never a valid pressing reason to lock it?<br /><br />Also can you please give us...the community... an example of&nbsp; a&nbsp; &quot;valid pressing reason for doing so?&quot;<br /><br />I understand editing out personal information or something that could harm a member...but locking a thread seems pointless. Also you know that every single person has been against locking of threads.I am just now speaking up. And since we are the forums...doesn&#039;t that count for something? Or do you just insist on having that tool to whip out if you and scout discuss it and you both feel a thread should be locked?

This is causing a massive rift in this community, setting users against each other and slowly eating away at the bonds that we&#039;ve all built with each other. We&#039;re all on the same damn side here.

Ergo, as no PM&#039;s were sent to me, it appeared as though the participants had no issues with it being locked. If they had PM&#039;d me with a valid reason for it be unlocked, I certainly would have listened to their views and unlocked it if necessary.<br /><br />I have stated that locking threads will be kept to an absolute minimum. That is all I am going to say on the matter, and I am not going to further explain my reasoning for locking that particular thread as I have stated it repeatedly here: this post, and the reasons given in my closing post can be considered as serving as examples of a valid, pressing reason for locking a thread with the caveat that locking threads will kept to a minimum - as close to zero as possible.<br /><br />I consider the discussion on this matter closed on my end, and will not be responding to any further queries from any member as to why that thread was locked as I have explained my reasons quite clearly here.<br /><br />Libertas

				Lets deal with reality a little bit...there are over 1200 active vendors on SR. There are over 10000 buyers. But at most there is 250 people in here...and on average it is about 100. There has never been a HUGE rift in this forum. EVER. At most it is 10 people...hardly a huge rift..and since everyone is a fake made up name in here...and the worst thing that can be said is &quot;I am giving up so and so&#039;s personal information&quot; the truth is it is always bullshit...and even that is something that is rarely said. And it surely was not said in the thread about negging! And if someone is dumb enough to make a threat...I assume you would just edit the thread....and then get rid of the account..other then that...lets keep things in perspective.<br /><br />But thanks for the explanation....

				To those people here who are critical of choices any one of us have made, why don&#039;t you get in touch with one of us directly when you have a problem with something we do?&nbsp; It&#039;d be a hell of a lot healthier for the community than simply festering in anger until it explodes like this has.&nbsp; I have only ever received one single PM from someone who took issue with something I wasn&#039;t doing, and I took what they said to heart and tried to address their concern.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t high school.&nbsp; If you have a problem with someone, TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT.&nbsp; Directly!&nbsp; Give them the chance to understand where you&#039;re coming from, what&#039;s wrong, and how they can do things differently.&nbsp; We won&#039;t all agree 100% of the time, but I guarantee there wouldn&#039;t be this ridiculous amount of divisiveness if people would PM each other rather than stew in their anger over something that the other person might not even realize they have done!&nbsp; Or maybe they had a good reason to do it that you are unaware of and can&#039;t know unless you talk to them!<br /><br />I keep saying this, but if you have a problem with something I am doing, TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.&nbsp; Please!&nbsp; Most of you all know very well that I have no problem admitting it when I&#039;m wrong, and I can take criticism when given the opportunity to understand your side of things / your perception.<br /><br />This thing where people get pissed off about something and then never say anything about it until it blows up like this is ... not working.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to like me, or any of us, but we try to do our best for the community and if you approach any of us (without the personal attacks) you would see our hearts are in the right places, even when we do something you don&#039;t necessarily agree with.

Not that you helped yourself InfiniteSource with what you said, still though, how can anything be discussed if mods are locking threads left, right and centre. Every single thread I posted on today -- up to a point -- was locked with extremely weak reasoning I just didn&#039;t buy.<br /><br />@ InfinateSource: Why have admin and the mods become so personal lately? Those messages are just personal and not professionally neutral at all. I am not sure why they have become unfriendly as of late.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I agree 100%.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you want to battle misinformation you do not do it by locking threads. Discussion is key and the truth will come out in the wash. Every time I see a locked thread I get a little more saddened about the direction these forums are headed.<br /><br />I do not believe DPR has given the mods strict guidelines as to what they can and can&#039;t lock/remove. Who is steering the ship if everyone gets to have their hand on the helm?<br /><br /><br /><br />Those messages from support were not professional at all. Very disheartening. Clearly they weren&#039;t written by DPR - he/she would never speak that way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for raising a pertinent point (+K)<br /><br />These are the threads that were locked as soon as I posted:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.0 The Score On Negging on Silk Road forums <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166679.0 Negative Karma? -14 Karma&#039;s overnight? What did I say? <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165534.0 negative Karma <br /><br />The reasoning for all three were baseless and weak. This was locked recently with comparative weak reasoning from samesame:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162935.0 People who FE&#039;d for InfiniteSource look here <br /><br />I don’t know what Libertas is going on about what a free forum this is when all four threads were locked on personal reasons. The reasoning for all four is weak, and not very convincing. It is not up for mods to lock a thread where they have taken exception to, wait 5 minutes to think of something half convincing, post it to have the final say in the matter, and then re-lock it. I can understand if it were for tech section, but this is just personal feelings brought into moderating and it is very very derisive for the community to see them acting this way. <br /><br />samesame made himself look like an idiot in the first thread. Thread was locked. (He also derailed the thread, made personal attacks, I called him for it, and he couldn’t handle my replies b/c he said his “head hurt”. The thread was locked with a bullshit reason by Libertas.)<br /><br />The second and third links were threads locked for a mod’s personal feelings on the issue, without leaving me an opportunity to respond, and the fourth was InfiniteSource’s thread that was locked when StExo asked a pertinent question they didn’t like. The reason by samesame was that it “simply didn’t to be up anymore”, which simply dumb.<br /><br />I’ve also noticed that every single person who replied with something to do with free speech on the forums, or mods locking every thread in sight, has been negged. I have been watching this thread unfold and PrincessHIGH, RxKing, and farmer1 have been negged as soon as they posted. Hmm. Let me guess, you are going to once again chalk that up to “wild coincidence” just like the time PrincessHIGH was negged 18 times immediately after posting on my thread, 14 times in 30 seconds and then 4 more times within the hour. <br /><br />Explain to me how this is a free forum when every time something is written a mod has personal issues over, the thread is locked&nbsp; with them having the last say, and the poster getting negged? And no more bullshit replies about FUD and disinformation, b/c I have had a stomach full this week of samesame’s hidden and unstoppable Illuminati shill army from one freaking account, sorry it is embarrassing when you think about.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have never once used profanity in any of my posts on the forums, and I say the following in a personal capacity, not as a moderator:<br /><br />Razorspyne: get the fuck over yourself and grow up.<br /><br />Act your age. Get a hobby. Do something worthwhile. Get out in the air sometime, see the world. Socialise. Talk to friends. Enjoy yourself. Don&#039;t sweat the little things. Grow up.<br /><br />[Me]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you Libertas for showing us why DPR needs to oversee the selection process for mods. If you have to resort to childish insults instead of answering the questions posited, then just how capable are you at moderating or showing neutrality? Perhaps you are the one who needs to get the fuck over yourself and grow up.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				You said I lost my credibility.... yeah sorry, that is personal. You are not here to give your opinion of who is &quot;respected&quot; or not respected, and you have evidently no freaking clue on that score as rape is not considered not respectable.<br /><br />I think it is time to shuffle off, as you have not done anything constructive here on this thread except make personal attacks. I am sorry that you turned out this way, I would think that you would want to support, not abuse, a long time member who has given their all since the very first day I joined, I feel sorry for you. PrincessHIGH was attacked and I simply defended her, samesame was stupid enough to neg in normal mode and he was caught out. I went in to bat for her because that is what a respectable member of the community does. You are clueless as to what brought this all on. You could have PM&#039;d me and I would have told you what the problem was with that prick. You are out of the loop on the issue so you just assumed samesame&#039;s version was correct. samesame is quite simply an idiot who was going off second hand information. This has devolved since then in an aggressive personal way because of your stupidity. <br /><br />No Lib, I have not lost my respect. If there is one thing I can be relied on it is supporting respectable members of the community. I had the balls to shed light on an issue, and that is what I did. As for mods making personal attacks on a respectable member, and bullying people on here through censorship, you tell me who has lost their respect? Your behaviour has been embarrassing, and DPR needs to re-evaluate the mod selection process and go back to selecting mods himself.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters

Your defense of your associate is admirable, if perhaps hard for me to understand, but all you have to do is read their posts and see that reason is something that they are either unwilling or unable to employ.<br /><br />Threads are not being locked left, right and center, nor will they be. Please read my previous posts in this thread to see my explanation on that, and my assurance that thread locking will be kept to an absolute minimum - something that I have stated you all have my word on, and that you can all hold me personally responsible for regardless of who locks it.

				This is the most entertaining thought provoking topic I have read in light years<br /><br />Please sticky this webber charcoal thread&nbsp; as it&#039;s anything but red meat rare <br /><br />Moderators do not lock and unload it ain&#039;t quite null and void... <br /><br />It ain&#039;t all black and white let&#039;s let ones&nbsp; grey convictions play out to somewhat&nbsp; satisfactory dismay <br /><br /><br />To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself – that was the ultimate subtlety; consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word &#039;doublethink&#039; involved the use of doublethink.[2]<br /><br />VANILLA SKY

I am with RxKing locking threads left, right and center is wrong and goes against the &#039;freedom of speech&#039; which is supposed to be at the heart of what this forum stands for. What&#039;s wrong with the points Raz has raised? They are perfectly valid, why not stop trying to discredit him and do your job and investigate the issues at hand.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, I locked the thread for the reasons stated in it; reasons I elaborated on earlier in this thread. I stated that telling Razorspyne that he needs to grow up and not sweat the small stuff was said in a personal capacity and not in my capacity as a moderator. Sometimes you get tired of explaining the same things again and again to the same person, until you realise that the underlying problem is, in fact, that they are simply incapable of listening to you - in a personal capacity, I stated as much.<br /><br />I assure you that as a moderator I am entirely neutral. Your defense of your associate is admirable, if perhaps hard for me to understand, but all you have to do is read their posts and see that reason is something that they are either unwilling or unable to employ.<br /><br />Threads are not being locked left, right and center, nor will they be. Please read my previous posts in this thread to see my explanation on that, and my assurance that thread locking will be kept to an absolute minimum - something that I have stated you all have my word on, and that you can all hold me personally responsible for regardless of who locks it. I wish to protect the freedoms that we all enjoy here, not destroy them.<br /><br />The points Razorspyne has brought up have all been addressed both in this thread and the one that was locked; I am not going to repeat myself ad nauseum when the points raised have already been addressed.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Weird. Lib, you are the only who seems to think that I am not logical or on point. Yes, go through my posts, most people have said the opposite.

				Because that vagina should have got on a chair, rapped one wing (oh shit I mean lip) round it neck (yeah it deffo had a neck) and thrown the bat wing (oh shit I mean lip, definitely was a vagina lip) over the beam and queefed the chair from under itself and gone to met it&#039;s maker. Would have saved the farmer from trying to shoot it later from trying to steal the chickens through sheer hunger and desperation.

				To contribute to this great thread, I am going to add a small random exert from Gordon Skinner&#039;s criminal case.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Green remembers that he eventually passed out during this assault and that when he woke up, Skinner was kneeling over him with a hypodermic needle, injecting something into his penis.   Green&#039;s comprehension then got “extremely blurry,” and he has very few clear memories of the incredible torture that he was subjected to over the next four days at the Tulsa Doubletree and then at a Houston area motel after that.&nbsp; Evidence presented at trial established that the torture at the Tulsa hotel included numerous and repeated injections by Skinner into Green&#039;s penis, testicles, buttocks, and other parts of his body, with the apparent dual purpose of permanently disabling and disfiguring Green sexually and of keeping him in a prolonged state of unconsciousness, while he was being physically, sexually, and emotionally assaulted by Skinner.&nbsp; Skinner also brutally punched and kicked Green in the genitals, lifted Green&#039;s unconscious body up off the bed by grabbing him at the base of his genitals,11 and wrapped a phone cord about Green&#039;s penis, put his foot on Green&#039;s stomach, and jerked until he heard “the cartilage snap.”<br /><br />During this time Skinner also prepared a foul-smelling “tea,” which he both forced Green to drink and injected him with, causing Green to vomit violently.   Both Hauck and Green testified about a particularly disturbing thing that Green vomited up, which had little worm-like things inside it, and that Skinner claimed was a “parasite sack.”   In addition, and at the direction of Skinner, Green&#039;s eyes were covered and he was told that if he took the covering off, his retinas would be burned.   Skinner then pretended to be a Swedish doctor, who had come to “help” Green, but who actually tormented him and put suppositories and perhaps other things in Green&#039;s anus.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

You used to be quite a respected member as well, Razorspyne, but you have lost a huge amount of that - along with your credibility - in recent times due to your glaring inability to employ reason and logic, and engaging in a campaign of personal attacks of people who spend up to 18 hours a day here helping this community.<br /><br />Your childish attempt at discrediting HEATFan is not doing your credibility any favours at all.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is TOTALLY uncalled for and totally WRONG. You are just a mod...get off your high horse. Don&#039;t act like the forums are the road! And you saying he has lost respect or credibility in the recent times....LOL..you mean the recent time he has called you out?? And talking about calling the Kettle black??? Personal attacks .. like this -one you are doing because you do not like he has called you out? And saying he USED to be a respected member WTF...HE IS STILL A RESPECTED MEMBER!!&nbsp; And has not lost a HUGE amount of anything...and who is the person spending 18 hours helping all of us inhere??? IF someone is spending 8 hours in the forums...they need drugs! There is NO WAY any humna needs to spend 18 houts on the forums!! THE FORUMS!! I feel like Allen Iverson saying &quot;practice? your talking about Practice?&quot;&nbsp; How you even dragged Heatfan into this and tried to pit them against each other is ludicrous.&nbsp; And I am sorry Heat...as I wish I was not even saying your name...an I am by no means saying ANYTHING about you...but this was so out of line for him to say. I know that forums mods are not shit...I was one.I also know that Heatfan REALLY WANTS TO BE ONE!!! I think he should get his chance..when you resign!!! You clearly have LOST it and you have shown you can not be impartial. And that is someone calls you out...you attack and start saying bullshit abot them.This was so uncalled for..and actually flat out wrong. Who other then you,heatfan(assuming) and scout..that actually said he is totally embarrassed but at the same time has your back...so other then you 3....who is everyone he lost his cred with??? Name names if you are going to make a stupid statement!&nbsp; He has not lost any with me! And I have all the CRED in the world on the big boy site! You know...the real site that every single person here is a part of..but less then 10% of them are a part of this!! Lets call a spade a spade.<br /><br />Lets be honest...the forums have 120 people on average... and the main site has 1200+ vendors alone!!!..And 10000 active members!!&nbsp; Including all of us..and the real cred...the real deal..is over there.... NOT here!! That is a fact. This only exists for Silk Road. NOTHING ELSE. And for you to say something that is your personal opinion and has no weight at all and NOTHING TO back it up...is HORSE SHIT! And as I am the first to say most things...you need to quit! You can not do your job. And you are&nbsp; taking it way too serious and personal! Locking threads..making statements that are not true...and going around acting as if you have not made a mistake. Yet you locked threads because the OP asked you to!!!<br /><br />I agree with scout...this is EMBARRASSING.&nbsp; And I also 100% agree with Princess HIGH. And I would like to know the&nbsp; password to the secret place where all you big timers in here meet and talk about who is in and who is out.<br /><br />It is so sad it came to this..and the forums should be locked! BY DPR, <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know how to reply to something like this b/c I am used to the drivel by Lib, scout, and samesame. What an intelligent analysis RxKing. And what a dumb response to this by Lib. Almost sounds like she is self-defeated. Although I am glad she DIDN&#039;T respond to you as everytime she talks crap that just goes nowhere. <br /><br />Thank you for your words. That took a lot of balls -- something that is lacking around here lately. Lib is entitled to her opinion (or are we still going with the &quot;he&quot; story? Lol!) but feels that everyone on the forum stands to attention when she sneezes. Mods&#039; opinions of someone don&#039;t mean jack-all. I feel I have done enough on the forums to be judged on them rather than a mod&#039;s ill-informed opinion of me. Thank you for recognising that a lengthy duration spent productively on the forums does not dissolve overnight on the word of a mod with a personal agenda. <br /><br />I agree with every ferking one of your points! :) Thank god some people in here have a brain. Well, the Security and Philosophy posters do, but they aren&#039;t on Discussion are they. As for HEATFan, well, he hasn&#039;t been around for very long so this wasn&#039;t his issue as he didn&#039;t know the background. So I didn&#039;t really notice that he had posted anything until someone told me. It is clear as day that the mods have shown us that they need replacing as they cannot handle moderating without abusing their position, by negging people of good character, and locking any thread they don&#039;t like. <br /><br />Thank you for putting a clear and cutting spotlight on this issue! :) They have clearly lost it and attacking people who disagree with them. I watched the negs pile on every single person who posted who brought up their locking threads. I know Lim was a disgrace, how someone that young can be given a modding position is beyond me. You saw what he did last year and his abuse of the modding position was a clear indication that Lim was not ready for that responsibility as he is still very young and as yet can&#039;t perfect mdma or correctly identify 4-MMC. It was like handing a toddler something valuable, you knew Lim was going to prove to be a fuck up. What happened? He fucked up. And his negs are a tribute to what people on the forum really think of him.<br /><br />Thanks for your points! &gt;:D They were so on point, it was a great post and a great read!<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

Matter is a strange word. As by definition...you are correct..it would not matter. <br /><br />But by not declaring if you are indeed a female...that means you are a female...as any man would deny it in a second! There is absolutely no security reason to not say if you are a man or a woman.. BUT you do not for any reason ti&nbsp; HAVE to tell us either. And this is the first time I have seen you deny the question..meaning you actually saying you will not say. I do not think respect is the right word..but I understand your right to not answer it.<br /><br />But as you even know..if I were to ask someone a question..like &quot; do you enjoy fisting&quot; and they say... &quot;I would rather not answer&quot;...that means they LOVE it. If they did not love it...and in fact they were not into it...they would never ever answer...&quot;I would rather not answer&quot; as they would never,even&nbsp; for 1 second..want someone to think they could love fisting.&nbsp; I think you deserve respect and I would never ask you if you are into that...or if you are hot...or if you are into men. Good for you becoming a mod as a woman.. YOU should celebrate it! It is a powerful position to make it TOO In the SR revolution. The bromance I was sensing with HeatFan..is actually a Romance!! And you could be first couple of SR. As Lim and Cristy are just into really kinky shit and it&#039;s purely sexual. Where as you too it seems have built a liking based on the mind!!<br /><br /><br />I think if you did come out that you would feel better. And maybe it would take the edge off around here.<br /><br />You being a woman makes so much sense...I mean it clears everything up...CRYSTAL CLEAR!! In fact there is no way you cannot be a woman. IMPOSSIBLE!&nbsp; And cementing it is saying...&quot;I have never stated on the forums which gender I am, nor will I. It does not matter for the purpose of moderating whether I am male or female&quot; <br /><br />When thinking of you in terms of being a woman..it makes so much sense on the things you have done/not done..as before ...it was so frustrating reading you answers... but now....I have a smile because I understand. <br /><br />You should really come out. You do not need to hide. SR community will support a woman Mod. So please...come out of the shadows and stop lying about your sexuality. It is 2013 and we are ready for some cutting edge shit. And then you can mentor Heatfan and instead of just 18 hours a day on here..the super user combo of you two..in a dual role as co-mods...could handle this place 24/7.<br /><br />And I think you need a nick name...the Lakers have &quot;Showtime&quot; .. Floyd Mayweather has &quot;Money&quot;... the Clippers have Lob City...you guys could be &quot;Lock city&quot; and your motto could be..&quot;There is only one Key...and we share it!&quot;

If a mod hadn&#039;t gone around provoking members then this would never have devolved this way. This macho bullshit of overzealous modding where they are begging to start fights with people does nothing to Silk Road forum&#039;s image. They are more interested in fighting and personal attacks than solving any issues, which makes me wonder why they are there in the first place.<br /><br />You need mods to run a forum, but if they are simply not working out, then replace them. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You would love that wouldn&#039;t you Raz if your little hate campaign resulted in the mods loosing their positions, would it make you feel special and powerful? <br /><br />Here are some FACTS for you, you are driving this, no one else. You started this by posting from your shill and getting caught out, all verifiable as all I need to do it go into the recycle bin and pull up that thread where it happened, Libertas can attest to your begging messages to edit your name out of the post he quoted thus putting it beyond a ninja edit.<br /><br />Your persistent defaming of the mods probably should just go unchallenged as it is clearly just fanning the flames but as I have stated before I have just as much of a right to defend myself as the next person, mod or no mod so when someone is posting lies and bullshit expect to get called on it. If you then decide to go running around the forums crying about personal attacks you really need to take a look at your own behavior because ironically the things you are accusing us (the mods) of doing are in fact precisely what YOU are doing, that is called projection.<br /><br />You bear a grudge, you blame scout and probably me for nomads demotion, something that is between nomad and DPR and has NOTHING to do with either scout nor I. You can keep this going for as long as you want, your personal attacks against me are water off a ducks back, you really are not that important despite carrying on like some holder of the truth crusading around the forums championing the cause against the evil mods you have decided no longer live up to your expectations.<br /><br />As someone said earlier, get a life and get over it, this is proving nothing and is now at laughable levels of ridiculousness.<br /><br />If you want to draw a line under this I would welcome it with open arms, the balls in your court as they say.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				From what I&#039;ve read Krystal went to the DEA because Skinner was starting to become really crazy but the DEA ignored her (and Green), which is why they got kidnapped and Green got his penis mutilated. That story is really crazy! I don&#039;t know if Krystal participated in that penis torture thing though, there is no real evidence against her except Green but he was high as fuck, and she hadn&#039;t done crazy shit like that before, unlike that asshole Gordon that killed someone by injecting him with a shitload of psychedelics. I think Krystal&#039;s story of them both getting tortured is a little more believable, but still... That poor Green guy... It must&#039;ve hurt. It&#039;s a real shame he got away with all these crimes for so long just because he was a fucking rat.

That story is really crazy! I don&#039;t know if Krystal participated in that penis torture thing though, there is no real evidence against her except Green but he was high as fuck, and she hadn&#039;t done crazy shit like that before, unlike that asshole Gordon that killed someone by injecting him with a shitload of psychedelics. I think Krystal&#039;s story of them both getting tortured is a little more believable, but still... That poor Green guy... It must&#039;ve hurt. It&#039;s a real shame he got away with all these crimes for so long just because he was a fucking rat.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />She went to them yes and they ignored her yes but she was not kidnapped.&nbsp; She was there while Green was being tortured by her own will.&nbsp; She snitched on him to the DEA again when he was giving away free MDMA to everyone at burning man and they went and got him that time and he was caught with a pound of MDMA crystals.&nbsp; They all were rats.&nbsp; They say when you follow the chain all the way to the top, of drug dealers and law enforcement that there is no distinction between the two.&nbsp; They know each other up there.&nbsp; Someone is law enforcement is chummy with the chemist at the top.&nbsp; DEA knew pickard.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that isn&#039;t true in every case but it&#039;s something to think about.&nbsp; DEA/CIA very well knows the heads of the cartels and works with some to obtain all of the cocaine and heroin that the CIA imports.

				She&#039;s also a user, it&#039;s the classic story of some fucking pole dancer who got tired of giving £10 blow-jobs in the back room finding someone to latch on to. Only real difference is this story didn&#039;t go out in a blaze of Cocaine, this time it was some hippie shit where they talk about Entheogens and their feelings which is even worse because it&#039;s boring and nobody gets shot.

And I&#039;ve seen and done too much. For God, country, and man. I spent 8 years in special services doing things for this country that would make most people cringe. I&#039;ve been in the fog of war and been fired upon by women and children. I&#039;ve made very shocking decisions on the battlefield. Government discharged me honorable and I had no means. And started vending. And make a good lot of money doing it. I will NOT tolerate insubordination. I will NOT tolerate playing around on my watch. My employees know it. They&#039;re well compensated. 1 employee of mine though it fit to steal from my operation. I didn&#039;t confront him, I didn&#039;t accuse him, I didn&#039;t cast an evil eye on him. No. I took my loaded Glock 17 and put it to the back of his head and put 2 rounds through him. And my other employees knew to never, ever, EVER fuck with me again.<br /><br />I am a no nonsense gentleman. And I see some very, VERY! disturbing allegations here. The main allegation is by a crack addict keeps babbling some nonsense about neighbors and DEA and what not. I see others have chimed in to insult me too. Well well, is taking me on, really that smart?<br /><br />Aston Mother Fucking Marteen.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: AstonMarteenOfficial</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Cool my jets&quot;? You really just used that dated phrase? With all due respect Mr. Libertas.. you are not the principal of a boys academy that I am a pupil of. I understand you&#039;re newfound status as a moderator might be an exciting period in your life.. but do not speak to me like that. I have never threatened anyone veiled or otherwise. Why would I threaten a customer? Now, if a customer is messaging me in all caps in a crack cocaine induced frenzy and screaming and yelling, I will tell him to shut his fucking crackhead mouth. That&#039;s my right, and I love that I&#039;m able to exercise it. If my &quot;jets&quot; werent &quot;cooled&quot;.. then it would be bad. And I don&#039;t want things to be bad, I like things being good. When I was on the ground in Kandahar, a local contractor who was helping us with logistics kept direspecting me. And I ignored it, knowing it was a local custom to speak loudly etc. But then he kept doing it, after I politely requested he back off. He didnt. So I simply grabbed his face and picked him up a few inches off the ground by his neck (literally like in the cartoons) and squeezed until his gasps turned into silence. Sure I was reprimanded by my CO, but it was worth. I&#039;m a reasonable man. I&#039;ve a fantastic, thriving business selling drugs. I don&#039;t need this crackfiend&#039;s $500 dollars.. I really don&#039;t. He is apparently a troll or desperate for attention.. which you people have given him. That being said, I LOOK FORWARD to an investigation by SR. They can have access to all my communications. They will see this nutcase is just trying to create a raucous because he didn&#039;t get his 8ball of crack during the site&#039;s down period. I&#039;m sorry OP, I&#039;m sorry you didn&#039;t get your crack fix. But that&#039;s not my problem sir. I don&#039;t control the site. I didn&#039;t send you any message demanding money or threatening to call the the cops or anything. That is so silly that it borderlines on farce.<br /><br />One thing though. A crackhead on the forum can start a thread tarning the rep of an established vendor without any reprecussion.. yet some two bit moderator with 1 week under his belt is telling me to &quot;cool&quot; my &quot;jets&quot;? This man is spreading FUD against me and my business, and I demand it stop.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t ever release a buyers information here or anywhere. I don&#039;t even save buyer information past mailing. No need for it. The OP has lost his marbles and is concocting stories in his crack fueled paranoia.. but please don&#039;t bring me into your hallucinations you whiny little motherfucker.<br /><br />Mr Libertas -&nbsp; I see the penalties for vendors threatening a buyer are grave. As they should. What, good sir, would be the penalties to a buyer hurling insanities at a vendor of good standing?<br /><br />I am a drug dealer, I am heavily armed, and I am trained by the state to be a lethal, cold hearted bastard. But I don&#039;t play around when it comes to my business.. and I don&#039;t tolerate others playing around with my business either.<br /><br />IN REGARDS TO LIARS: Levicitus 20:13 &quot;If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.

I just bit right into his adams apple and put him out of commission. Other then that, I&#039;m a nice guy.

I was grilling myself a steak for lunch. And 1 of the steaks was undercooked. I think I forgot to grill it for more then a minute. It was beyond rare. It was literally bleeding, dripping blood of the cow. For a second I thought &quot;oh, I should cook it a little more&quot;. But then a voice in my head told me to try it as is, I might enjoy the taste. You know what happened next? I did. I ate it. I loved it completely rare and raw. Dripping in its natural red juices. It satisfied me. It really, satisfied me in a way that even the loins of a woman couldn&#039;t.

Still, that;s a lot of negs! I remember when MasterBlaster left the thread &quot;Why Can I Not Cum in Your Kids?&quot; or something. It was left up for a very long time before finally being locked. There have also been several rape threads that have been not locked (some of them are still unlocked btw), but InfiniteSource&#039;s thread was locked as soon as StExo asked a question about why his account was being banned. It is hard to get a vendor&#039;s account banned, even with solid proof there have been instances where vendors have been allowed to continue vending despite going into Resolution. So his question was on point. The thread was locked soon after by samesame who gave the reason for locking the thread as &quot;doesn&#039;t need to be left open&quot;.<br /><br />So in answer to your q., some threads are locked and some threads aren&#039;t, but the rules are very movable. Child pornography threads may be accepted here for some time, but most are eventually locked at some point -- eventually. asshole&#039;s thread wasn&#039;t about child porn though, it was about mods editing posts, and that came up organically at some point.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: a﻿s﻿s﻿h﻿o﻿l﻿e on May 31, 2013, 05:54 pm</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I ended up receiving -18 karma. -11 within 3 minutes.<br /><br />Mods have full discretion when it comes to child pornography so it&#039;s up to them if they wanted to lock masterblaster&#039;s thread about cumming inside children (which they were okay with) or not.

When she didn’t return the same feelings you whimpered off, appearing every now and again to intermittently pop on a thread she has posted on to say hello to her.

Being a sad, moaning little kid, you then went around saying that you had seen her private parts. You haven’t. PrincessHIGH won’t dignify that b/c it is a little kid typing away at a keyboard instead of vending who everyone has gotten to know as some shit-talker. Lol, “ganster”. You’re a nobody on the forums and you are a nobody on the marketplace. Go find out what 4-MMC is, what money laundering entails, and the security gear you pretend to have, and come back and try again. <br /><br />And stop crying over the fact that PrincessHIGH wasn’t interest in you when you tried to be more than friends earlier this year and pretending you have seen her bits in retaliation, b/c it’s just proving how much of a crying little bitch you are. In fact, I haven’t seen any post from you recently that hasn’t involved your tears over PrincessHIGH. Go work on your failed vending instead of coming on here every day to moan.<br /><br />Oh, and work on your come backs kid. You make yourself look like a fag who’s never been laid, and who’s got nothing to do but talk shit on a forum and dream of how much they wannabe Scarface. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Alright Razor/Princess if you really want me to lay it on the line for you the reason why I KNOW Princess is the same person that send me a video of her awful vagina is because you Razor keep using personal information from the retarded story I gave Princess when she was someone else on here and so I KNOW she has fed this to you. The lines about dropping out of Uni? Being young? Bet she told you I told her my real first name was Oliver too yeah? Yeah that was just a bullshit story I gave TT/Princess on Torchat so she&#039;d send the YouTube vid. OOOOPS you just fucked YOURSELF! <br /><br />So you can throw your petty shitty insults that are based on some bullshit chat-up line I threw out just to talk up Princess/TT because I was, well, bored lol. So yes I do KNOW that Princess has a fanny that looks like a pigs face that&#039;s half way through a sausage machine and I do KNOW you are pulling out your insults from a story that enabled me to view said pigs face that&#039;s half way through a sausage machine. <br /><br />You just been served son. :)

Coming from a highly respected forum member like yourself, it actually means something to me! I am glad you will be coming back to post on your Newbie thread, I believe you have to -- there is a lot of information I found there that I didn&#039;t know before -- Though I understand time constraints and that you might not be as free as you&#039;d like to be, no truly successful vendor I know is on here posting reams every day. <br /><br />Glad you like my posts by the way. O0 I wish I could write freely but being a drug forum means I have to sacrifice anything that LE could use. Not just profiling, but helpful advice like how to spot a cop on the forums or how to pick out a vendor who is planning to go rogue, or has fake feedback. This is compounded by the fact that any information you send via PM can -- and often does -- go further than its initial recipient, though they will never admit to it. Sometimes the most helpful information I can give is sacrificed. Only an idiot tells people 100% of what they know. But thanks for reading what I do write Princess. :)<br /><br />I will be following your thread in a bit, it;s a really good thread and it needs you there. Don&#039;t change, and keep giving sound, expert information to people Princess b/c that seems to be your forte. Sorry you don&#039;t review as much any more, but NOBODY can review for a long amount of time and I have explained why here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148977#msg1148977 . Keep up the good work! Happy trails.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

It&#039;s sad that you have to sacrifice information however your anonymity and safety is paramount here, I like the fact you&#039;ve got your head firmly on your shoulders.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can&#039;t review much anymore, my busy lifestyle doesn&#039;t allow for it, I enjoyed reviewing while I could and would like to go back to it in the future. However it&#039;s true what you posted, some vendors will send a &#039;high grade&#039; sample out to reviewers followed by &#039;low grade&#039; products to the buyers, it saddens me and it makes me less willing to review, as I hate anyone getting scammed as no one deserves to be.<br /><br />Keep up the great posts Raz and never loose your sparkle, your one of the shining beacons of our community :)

Its not justice, its a god damn monarchy<br />~InfiniteSource1<br /><br /><br />I have funds in that account which I own; orders which were finalized. This does not belong to you. I attempted to refund bitcoins for users who FE&#039;d, but I was outed in the forums and no one would even contact me to arrange a refund.&#039;&#039;<br />~InfiniteSource1<br /><br /><br />SR Support &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your right that last message was not quite correct. We already completed our investigation before banning you and you are very much guilty. It was obvious you are among a class of the most despicable and dishonest scammers that we have seen. No matter how much we manage to confiscate from you, it will pale in comparison to the enormous financial damage you have done to our users. The damage you have done to the reputation of our marketplace is enough to warrant any punishment we are capable of, all of which are much too lenient for the likes of you. You are permanently banned from selling here, and if we find out that you have opened a new vendor account we will immediately shut it down, and keep the $500 bond you pay for it.<br /><br />~SR Support<br /><br /><br />Pretty harsh for two privnotes they never even saw.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>´wow really?? I really hope you´re lying, if SR support did do that and they are concluding investigations without even asking for justification from the accused then it makes me re-think a lot of things. Whats to ban someone with a grudge creating a few accounts with purchases behind them and claiming being harrased / scammed in the same way. how can one SR Admin have the power to take away someones livelihood ? is that the way it goes? one admin alone conducts the investigation, sets the rules and imposes the penalty? There is a reason in english law that the people that make the law are separate from the people that uphold it, and the people that implement it... One person being judge, jury and executioner is bery dangerous, especially when you perceive a high level of personal emotion in their communications. It sounds like that SR Admin got scammed heavily once or twice before themselves... I don&#039;t know the OP, he may be a scamming bastard, no offense, but you still cant just have one person deciding that, taking away the money that may well be feeding his family and banishing someone without sharing the evidence they used to reach the assumption so it can be disputed.. <br />IMO DPR should be made aware of this, I don´t believe he would see this as right or just, he may reach the same penalty if the facts of the case are true but I think he would definitely question the method of administration. <br />makes me feel better about having auto withdraw set up, just hope our competitors aren&#039;t cowardly enough to resort to trying to destroy a competitor this way instead of engaging in market competition. <br /><br />ACE

I´m aware the Admins are very carefully selected to be what they are, but every human is subject to personal bias and past experience.
