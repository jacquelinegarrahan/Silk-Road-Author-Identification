				What do you guys make of this? <br /><br />http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/city-news/anonymous-group-allegedly-hacked-romney-tax-records-franklin-firm<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />CityProperties<br />Anonymous group allegedly hacked Romney tax records via Franklin firm<br />Tuesday, September 4, 2012 at 9:33pm<br />By Ken Whitehouse<br />Printer-friendly versionSend to friend<br /><br />An anonymous individual or group is alleging that they have gained &quot;all available 1040 tax forms&quot; of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney by accessing computers in the Franklin office of the professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.<br /><br />An anonymous posting on a text-sharing website states that PwC has been hacked. This same website has been used by hackers who have claimed to have infiltrated computers from companies like Apple in the past.<br /><br />An excerpt from one message states:<br /><br />&quot;Romney&#039;s 1040 tax returns were taken from the PWC office 8/25/2012 by gaining access to the third floor via a gentleman working on the 3rd floor of the building. Once on the 3rd floor, the team moved down the stairs to the 2nd floor and setup shop in an empty office room. During the night, suite 260 was entered, and all available 1040 tax forms for Romney were copied. A package was sent to the PWC on suite 260 with a flash drive containing a copy of the 1040 files, plus copies were sent to the Democratic office in the county and copies were sent to the GOP office in the county at the beginning of the week also containing flash drives with copies of Romney&#039;s tax returns before 2010. A scanned signature image for Mitt Romney from the 1040 forms were scanned and included with the packages, taken from earlier 1040 tax forms gathered and stored on the flash drives.<br /><br />The group will release all available files to the public on the 28 of September, 2012.&quot;<br /><br />A follow up letter was also posted that states:<br /><br />&quot;All major news media outlets are going to be sent an encrypted copy of the most recent tax years that your company had on file since you did not have them all in a convenient electronic form. The years before 2010 will be of great interest to many. If the parties interested do not want the encrypted key released to the public to unlock these documents on September 28 of this year then payment will be necessary.<br /><br />The deal is quite simple. Convert $1,000,000 USD to Bitcoins (Google if if you need a lesson on what Bitcoin is) using the various markets available out in the world for buying. Transfer the Bitcoins gathered to the Bitcoin address listed below. It does not matter if small amounts or one large amount is transferred, as long as the final value of the Bitcoins is equal to $1,000,000 USD at the time when it is finished. The keys to unlock the data will be purged and what ever is inside the documents will remain a secret forever.<br /><br />Failure to do this before September 28, the entire world will be allowed to view the documents with a publicly released key to unlock everything.<br /><br />Bitcoin Address to Stop Release: [redacted]<br /><br />And the same time, the other interested parties will be allowed to compete with you. For those that DO want the documents released will have an different address to send to. If $1,000,000 USD is sent to this account below first; then the encryption keys will be made available to the world right away. So this is an equal opportunity for the documents to remain locked away forever or to be exposed before the September 28 deadline.<br /><br />Who-ever is the winner does not matter to us.&quot;<br /><br />The City Paper has been unable to independently confirm whether the county officials or PricewaterhouseCoopers have received packages. Federal law enforcement personnel would not confirm or deny an ongoing investigation into the matter.

				There were actually two versions of that letter on pastebin. I don&#039;t have the source in front of me, found it in the bitcointalk forum. The original letter basically said they had the tax returns and were going to release them if Romney didn&#039;t, etc. A week or so later the bitcoin extortion letter popped up, similar to the first but with obvious grammatical differences. I think it is two different people, someone just capitalizing on the first message. If you search the bitcointalk forums there are a few threads about it.

It would show how two faced this guy really is, but only asking for $1 million is pocket change for a guy who was able to use loopholes in 2011 to save him self an extra $4 million in tax breaks, who knows what he was able to pull off in previous years. Not saying Obama is much better, the whole system is fairly fucked, but Romney just seems worse.

				I also read this today, thought it was clever.<br /><br />My belief is that the conventional system on almost every aspect is illogical, unproductive, unsustainable, etc...<br />Between Democrats and Republicans, the most serious and affecting policy never changes; the Military industrial complex still rules, and occupys countries around the world, and Money is still printed out of thin air on a Monetary policy of straight up fallacy. Foreign aid is still wasted on propped up third world country dictators.<br /><br />Fractional Reserve Banking and High frequency Algorithmic trading has fucked up the markets wayy to much for this system to every legitimately sustain, rightfully so as it was illegitimate from the start....<br />Talk about illegitimate power structures/authority...<br />

				Lol people don&#039;t realize that when you are as rich as Romney there is NO NEED for evasion because you can avoid yourself down to under 5% anyway, I mean obviously there are the retarded ones but there aren&#039;t as many as you think actually evading tax on that scale. <br /><br />Anyway yeah, I&#039;m saying a big YAY for tax avoidance and long may it continue so I can get paid for my services.&nbsp; ;D
