				well, besides crack.<br /><br />i just got this 1000mAh variable volt battery with a vivi nova tank and man.....looking at this thing is hilarious.&nbsp; its gigantic and looks like some sorta steampunk magic wand.&nbsp; first auto batteries and cartos (the kind that look and function most closely to a cigarette) were my thing but i was spending MAD money on catridges.&nbsp; then i decided to start buying the liquid, but it has taken almost a year of trial and research to finally find the rig that delivers the perfect hit.<br /><br />and man, it takes some serious will on my part to put this thing down.&nbsp; i&#039;ve gradually brought myself down to liquid with the lowest concentration of nicotine, but still...i can&#039;t fuckin stop with this shit, its just too good.<br /><br />i am, at least, glad that i got into vaping over my previous diet of spliffs and hookah.&nbsp; sucking down two coals and a few spliffs or blunts everyday was just terrible for my health and well being.&nbsp; but they definitely didn&#039;t have the &quot;cracky&quot; feeling that vaping nicotine juice does.&nbsp; if nicotine was $20 per hit, i guarantee people would go almost as crazy for it as they do for crack.
