				Hi I&#039;m new here and have read most of the general how-to guides and such but have yet to find any info detailing the process by which one can go from being classified on the forums as a Newbie to Jr. Member, Full Member, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering what criteria you guys use to advance members on the forum. What can I do to increase my rank?

				And then there&#039;s the Karma system. You have to have 100 posts before you can dole out Karma. Be a good son and only dole out + Karma. But if you must dole out negative karma, be a man and let the person know it was you and why. A simple post in the thread that rubbed you the wrong way will suffice to explain why you left negative karma. <br /><br />In spite of all that, have fun. :) And read, read, read. I wouldn&#039;t want you to fall prey to a finalize early scam.

				It&#039;s not about how much you post it&#039;s about what you have to say. Karma is a much more accurate reflection of your personality than your post count. Having a high post count just means you have a lot to say, how much +/- Karma indicates if what you have to say is useful and contributes positively or whether you are regarded as a bullshitter or an antisocial ass-hat. <br /><br />Hope this helps. :)

				I lot of times, negative karma comes from cowards who happen to be high at the time so their reading comprehension skills are impaired. Other times it comes from vendor groupies who just finished licking the sweat off their vendor&#039;s nut sack when you come along and point out a potential issue with the vendor. Likely, some of those people who left - karma probably wish they could take it back after realizing that you were warning them not to trust they vendor and they could have saved some coin and grief. <br /><br />Since obvious trolls are... well obvious, the negative karma doesn&#039;t really serve much purpose.
