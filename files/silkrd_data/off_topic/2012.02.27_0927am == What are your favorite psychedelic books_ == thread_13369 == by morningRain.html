				The Illuminatis Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and the Sprawl Trilogy by William Gibson are probably my favorite. Here are some torrents:<br /><br />http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4081423/Wilson__Robert_Anton_-_Illuminatus_Trilogy.pdf<br />http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5129248/Neuromancer_%28PDF%29<br />http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5193716/William_Gibson_-_Count_Zero<br />http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5193719/William_Gibson_-_Mona_Lisa_Overdrive<br /><br />Watch out for those sprawl oungans (Count Zero, pg. 66).

				Moving towards non-fiction writing, Robert Anton Wilson&#039;s &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; [1] might be interesting if you resonate with Leary. Wilson&#039;s version of Leary&#039;s 8 circuit model of consciousness is summarized at deoxy [2]. Continuing with the ogdoad theme, some might find it interesting to have a look at Spiral Dynamics [3].

				Nice thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d say The Doors Of Perception by Huxely is my fave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s not forget about Food Of The Gods by McKenna as well as a few other books by Terence.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve read a few books by Carlos Castaneda but I get the feeling that he&#039;s not fully truthful about his experiences and is probably a bit full of shit about situations that he says happened to him.&nbsp;

				Joseph Campbell&#039;s work in comparative religion and the analysis of myth are significant. The Mythos [1] video series is a convenient introduction and The Power of Myth [2] interview with Bill Moyers is also informative.<br /><br />[1] http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5906512/Joseph_Campbell_-_Mythos_I_and_II<br />[2] http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3748062/The_Power_of_Myth

				this is an interesting thread, thanks for some of the suggestions<br /><br />i definitely focus on the more non-fiction categories, personally i would definitely recommend shulgins works obviously! <br /><br />also for a great study on dmt and insight into scientific psychedelic research on humans, as someone recommend Strassman&#039;s DMT: the spirit molecule is interesting and a great resource for trip reports of intense IV DMT doses. kinda cool to read about all the red tape BS that had to be navigated to even be able to get permission from the DEA and FDA to synth, possess and administer the scheduled substance. then the book discusses the potential implications for the natural existence and release in humans from the pineal gland and potential spiritual aspects and the involvement in near death experiences which is fascinating<br /><br />another I read I enjoyed was McKenna&#039;s True Hallucinatons which was a frankly borderline schizophrenic account of one of McKennas first travels into the jungle and his first experiences with the magical mushroom that became such a major part of his philosophy. very entertaining and strange with shamanism, ufos, complete psychedelic induced psychotic mental breakdowns... and then the initial development of his rebirth theory focusing around 2012. interesting at the least.<br /><br />- miR

				I stole the wiki quote on this book it was so great i couldn&#039;t resist!<br /><br />The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is a work of literary journalism by Tom Wolfe, published in 1968. Using techniques from the genre of hysterical realism and pioneering new journalism, the &quot;nonfiction novel&quot; tells the story of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters. The book follows the Pranksters across the country driving in a psychedelic painted school bus dubbed &quot;Further&quot; (called &quot;Furthur&quot; in the book due to an initial misspelling on the bus&#039; placard), reaching what they considered to be personal and collective revelations through the use of LSD and other psychedelic drugs. The book also describes the Acid Tests, early performances by The Grateful Dead, and Kesey&#039;s exile to Mexico.<br />In 1968, Eliot Fremont-Smith of The New York Times called The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test &quot;not simply the best book on hippies… [but also] the essential book.&quot;[1]

				The following video lecture series might provide some foundation useful for interpreting the books presented in this thread.<br /><br />1. &quot;Growing Up in the Universe&quot; is a series of lectures given by Richard Dawkins as part of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, where he discusses the evolution of life in the universe.<br />2. &quot;Mythos&quot; is a multi-part documentary that consists of a series of lectures given by Joseph Campbell. Campbell conceived of the original lectures, filmed over the last six years of his life, as a summation of what he had learned about the human mythic impulse, in terms of psychology, ethnology and comparative mythology—what he called &quot;the one great story of mankind.&quot;<br />3. &quot;Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition&quot; is a comprehensive survey of the history of Western philosophy from its origins in classical Greece to the present. The course is an 84-lecture, 12-professor tour of Western philosophical tradition and covers more than 60 of history&#039;s greatest minds. <br />4. &quot;Discovering Psychology&quot;, A video instructional series on introductory psychology for college and high school classrooms and adult learners; 26 half-hour video programs.<br /><br />[1] http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3899076/Richard_Dawkins__Growing_Up_in_the_Universe_Part_1__2__3__4___amp__5<br />[2] http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5906512/Joseph_Campbell_-_Mythos_I_and_II<br />[3] http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4709165/TTC_Video_-_Great_Minds_of_the_Western_Intellectual_Tradition<br />[4] http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3619756/Discovering_Psychology_%28wmv%29_-_American_Psychological_Associatio<br />

				I don&#039;t know that it qualifies as &quot;psychedelic,&quot; but I recently really enjoyed &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by Philip K. Dick. I had to put it down and just let the mindfuck sink in a few times (granted I was pretty stoned, but I&#039;m convinced it was fairly trippy regardless). <br /><br />I&#039;d seen Blade Runner and wasn&#039;t into it for whatever reason. I definitely think the book outweighs the movie in this case. <br /><br />In a similar vein, I&#039;d recommend almost any Kurt Vonnegut (or at least his short story, &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;) and maybe some Thomas Pynchon or Chuck Palahniuk. Huxley, Thompson, Burroughs, and Wolfe are all solid suggestions--probably more what you&#039;re looking for, anyway.<br /><br />Hmm...how about some Buddhist texts? I&#039;d say &quot;The Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; or anything by Nagarjuna are good primary sources. &quot;The Way of Zen&quot; by Alan Watts is a famous American/beat era take on Buddhism, which might also be of interest. <br />
