				I think I saw some ants crawling around on your chair before you sat down. . . <br />They must be crawling all over your legs by now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hiding into your underwear.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;ll never know until you get up. !&nbsp;

				The Cliff Notes on the Situation:<br /><br />-&gt; I&#039;m not large, physically leaving the chair should not be a determinant.<br />-&gt; No superglue has been involved.<br />-&gt; Do not feel sleepy, just a lethargy in limbs and at the back of head.<br /><br />Conclusion: Pine has turned into a Slug. Or something :D<br /><br />Help me Scout! Why is this so difficult now!

				Pine has since left and returned to the chair several times now. <br /><br />Mainly due to a mint and coffee shortage :)<br /><br />Thanks for the moral support comrades!
