				I&#039;m sure the majority of us here can admit that there are certain unhealthy behaviors we continuously practice with certain drugs...whether this is because of addiction (physiological or psychological) or simply due to habituation is irrelevant.&nbsp; What are some of the behaviors you&#039;d like to change regarding your drug (ab)use this year?&nbsp; Here are mine:<br /><br />- Quit smoking cigarettes once and for all<br />- Stop abusing MDMA<br /><br />MDMA is a beautiful drug that can have a multitude of benefits if used in moderation and recreational/clinical doses.&nbsp; I found myself taking MDMA more and more frequently in 2012, and sometimes not spacing my rolls out enough.&nbsp; In December alone, I rolled thrice.&nbsp; The last two times I ate it in that month I ate half a gram, because I wasn&#039;t waiting long enough and I had to keep eating more to really feel it.&nbsp; I understand this is completely reckless, neurotoxic behavior, and I have certainly been feeling the negative effects: depression, short-term memory problems, worse comedowns, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first time I rolled in 2013, I only ate one Red ?, which is roughly 180mg.&nbsp; My goal for this year with MDMA is to only take 100-120mg of MDMA initially, and a 1/3 of my initial dose as a booster (if needed).&nbsp; I know that a lot of the harm in MDMA comes from redosing, especially if you dose after you&#039;re already coming down.&nbsp; If I still wanna rage after my booster, I will supplement my roll with something like 2C-B, NBOMEs, GHB, or Ketamine.&nbsp; I&#039;m off to a good start this year already.&nbsp; My second goal is to wait AT LEAST a month between every roll, no fucking exceptions.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t dole out negative karma for my stupidity, as I&#039;m sure plenty of other people have had similar experiences with abusing MDMA/other drugs.&nbsp; I love this community and I wanted to give everyone the chance to share their bad habits so that we can encourage each other to be safer and smarter drug users in 2013.&nbsp; :)

				Quitting smoking has to be one of the hardest things to do. I finally kicked the habit about a year ago, and I would be lying if I said I don&#039;t miss the sweet taste of tobacco smoke filling my lungs.<br />Make sure you have a strong support system, such as friends and family that know you&#039;re trying to quit smoking. If they truly love you, they will oblige.<br /><br />You will get mad at them, you will cuss a lot, and probably cry, I know I did.<br /><br />If you only rely on patches and gum, you will fail. Also if you decide to use patches, don&#039;t lick them, trust me... Just don&#039;t. Also, don&#039;t leave them on over night, you will have the scariest most fucked up dreams of your life; I dreamt I murdered my whole family, laughing the whole way.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get through it. I love you. (No homo)
