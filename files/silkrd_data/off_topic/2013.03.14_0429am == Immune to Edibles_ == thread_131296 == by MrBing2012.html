				So after join SR I got curious about edibles and always loved the idea of eating to get high but so far nothing has worked.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried edibles from 4 different vendors and have been greatly disappointed each time. I must have wasted around $100 on edibles and it really pisses me off.<br />I&#039;m wondering if I have some kind of stomach problem that doesn&#039;t allow me to absorb the THC or some shit like that or maybe my tolerance is just too high. <br />Anyone else have similar issues with edibles?

				Wondering about this, too.&nbsp; none of the eds I make seem to have any effect.&nbsp; Pretty sure I am doing it right, it&#039;s easy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry you wasted your cash.

				I have 2 friends like this as well. No matter what they eat they can never get high on edibles. I don&#039;t understand it either and would love someone to shed some light on it.

				Edibles can be tricky. Esp if your not sure on what kind of high your supposed to get. <br /><br />If their being bought on the Road, its safe to say its not the recipe or baking methods. So thats out for the OP, but for the other guy who said that when you make them they dont work, this may be your issue. i fin the most fool proof method is cooking the THC into vegetable oil. I like to use no less than 1/2 ounce of top shelf ins, per 1 cup of oil. Get it hot, then put the smoke in, has to be ground fine, then let simmer for about 15 min, constantly stirring. Then that oil is good for any recipe that calls for oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;To the OP, i can only imagine that you simply do not know what your feeling. When you cook or bake with bud, its changing the THC to CBD for the most part, before you put it in your body. So the high you get isnt even a high at all in a sense. Its a total couch-lock stone, like a hard indica stone. Very heavy on the body, and 9 times out of ten, with in a few hours it knocks you the fuck out, esp iff you eat too much, and too much too much, will almost always result in getting sick. <br /><br />Also when you ingest marijuana, it takes a minimum of 1 hour to take effect. Hope ive shed some light for you guys.

While strains with high CBD content give you the rock lock stone of indicas. I bake with my bud all the time, and it most certainly skips the head high, and goes right to the crippling stone, and almost burnt out feeling. Maybe baking doesnt actually change the THC to CBD, but youd have to convince me otherwise on this. <br /><br />EDIT; (coppied and pasted from beyondchronic.com (clearnet))<br /><br />&#039;And you can do the same thing when cooking. Many recipes call for cooking with cannabis at 350°F (or 325° “just in case” your oven isn’t calibrated). They warn you to keep the temperature that low “so you won’t hurt the THC”. Yet either temperature is far above the vaporization point of THC, which is precisely why “pot brownies” have such a legendary “stoned effect” on people: you’re getting all CBD. That’s why my recent experimENT with cooking firecrackers at low temperature (250°F) was so devastatingly effective…it left everything in.&#039;

				Eat a &quot;Hybrid&quot; cheebachew, they have high amounts of both CBD and THC, though I&#039;ll warn you that after getting used to eating those I was nearly un-phased by a bowl with amazing bud and hash on top, and that was nearly 3 weeks sober too.
