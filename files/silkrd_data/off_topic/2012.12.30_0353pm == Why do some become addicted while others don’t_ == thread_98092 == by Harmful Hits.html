				Throughout the years I have had the pleasure of doing all kinds of high quality drugs and now that SR is here my choices have only increased. I have fun and I like to party but my drug of choice is weed. At times I snort roxys, coke, or smoke meth but its rarely. Over the years I have watched as people I knew find their drug of choice for the first time sometime and become hooked hard. I have also watched other people smoke crack out of a bong, get high as fuck, and then just sit down and play PlayStation, not even wanting another hit.<br />So its clear that certain people are less prone to addiction for whatever reason. Does anyone have any ideas why some people seem less susceptible to addiction? <br />

				Very good question. <br /><br />I just did a search on the clearnet. Almost every source can agree on the following. They don&#039;t understand it yet, but they have found some risk factors.<br /><br />The widely recognized risk factors include:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Genes: <br />Genetics play a significant role: having parents with alcoholism, for instance, makes you four times more likely than other children to become alcoholics. More than 60 percent of alcoholics have family histories of alcoholism.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mental illness: <br />Many addicted people also suffer from mental health disorders, especially anxiety, depression or mood illnesses.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Early use of drugs: <br />The earlier a person begins to use drugs the more likely they are to progress to more serious abuse.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Social environment: <br />People who live, work or go to school in an environment in which the use of alcohol and other drugs is common - such as a workplace in which people see heavy drinking as an important way to bond with coworkers - are more likely to abuse drugs.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Childhood trauma: <br />Scientists know that abuse or neglect of children, persistent conflict in the family, sexual abuse and other traumatic childhood experiences can shape a child&#039;s brain chemistry and subsequent vulnerability to addiction. <br /><br />(source clearnet: http://www.hbo.com/addiction/understanding_addiction/14_some_people_become_addicted.html)<br />

				I&#039;m not much into the genetic predisposition talk, rather, I&#039;d say it depends on <br /><br />- your current mood (are you generally happy or depressed / why are you doing drugs)<br />- your social environement (education level and family-friends influence) <br />- your personal discipline <br /><br />That&#039;s about it, really.

				Good thread! I constantly have this argument with myself in my head. As an addict of fifteen years I find it hard to accept that Addiction is a disease, maybe the AA folks just couldn&#039;t think of a better word? I do believe genetics play a big role, but also environment and personal discipline or lack thereof. <br />I have been able to moderate at times with my drug use, but not always. I also think that mental illness and addiction are so closely related because certain drugs can lead to mental illness when abused as I have learned the hard way.

You couldn&#039;t imagine yourself being an alcoholic because you&#039;ve been raised by alcoholic parents&nbsp; in a working class environement and poor future perspectives ? Would you say it&#039;s al about the genes ? You couldn&#039;t imagine one of your parent being a drug-addict because he grew in a drug-infested environement ? Would you say it&#039;s all about the genes ? <br /><br />I pretty much consider environement as the dominating factor here. Imagine this case: your genes predispose you to have a 150 IQ score. Do you think you could have a 150 IQ score if your parents held you locked in a closet during all your childhood ? C&#039;mon.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s ALL about the genes either, so we are mostly in agreement. :) We may differ as to the relative contribution of various factors, though.

				Indeed. <br /><br />I&#039;m just annoyed with the gene and neurochemistry talk, such a perfect excuse for one&#039;s behaviour. I&#039;m depressed ? My neurochemistry imbalance&#039;s fault. I&#039;m an addict ? It&#039;s my grandfather&#039;s gene fault. No rational person should buy into this.&nbsp; <br />

				Well, your body IS chemistry, not magic.<br /><br />But more importantly you seem to espouse a simplistic view of genetic influence. It&#039;s not deterministic, 1:1, 1 gene leads to exactly 1 outcome. Genes influence traits, including behavior, to varying degrees, and in concert with other factors.

				I found a gem in an other thread, by ZenAndTheArt.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67361.msg575127#msg575127">Quote from: ZenAndTheArt on November 08, 2012, 11:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think the word &#039;disease&#039; can be misleading when discussing addictions. My dictionary (which sits next to my keyboard as my spelling is terrible) states; Disease - n. an unhealthy condition caused by infection or diet or by faulty functioning of a bodily process. It also states that; Addicted - adj. 1. doing or using something as a habit or compulsively. 2. devoted to something as a hobby or interest. addiction n. (Hobby? Bit of an understatement).<br /><br />I believe its misleading because it suggests less of a mental ownership of the addiction process. To me, a disease is a totally involuntarily acquired condition. Whereas an addiction has an element of choice to it. However, by saying I believe there&#039;s an element of choice, I&#039;m not ignoring the evidence of genetic predisposition in addiction.<br /><br />I recently watched a program where some scientists were investigating the role of genetic predisposition in addiction. They found that compulsive and habit forming behaviour (addiction) was present in rodents to the same degree as in&nbsp; human, around 10% if I remember correctly. One of there tests involved a button, when pressed it would deliver as small dose of a pleasurable substance (I can&#039;t remember if it was cocaine or some other stimulant that would work on rats). They found that the majority of the rats would press the button a few times, but in general they&#039;d continue with their normal routines of social interactions and feeding or sleeping. Whilst a minority of the rats (around 10%) would continue pressing the button and let it interfere with their daily routine to the detriment of their social interactions, feeding and sleep patterns. They would even keep pressing the button after it stopped producing the pleasurable substance, until it started working again.<br /><br />Now the important findings about these tests wasn&#039;t that a variety of species all displayed a similar percentage for predisposition to addictive behaviour, it was that the predisposition could be showed to be genetic. They found the human patients who all displayed a predisposition to addiction all had similar brain activity. They all had the same specific areas of their brain that functioned differently. And these areas could be showed to relate to addictive behaviour, and would have developed that way at the genetic level.<br /><br />Finally, on a personal level, I believe that as human beings we are ultimately responsible for our own actions. Because we have higher thought processes and a greater level of understanding. Whilst it is a great disadvantage to be one of the 10% who are predisposed to addictive behaviour, one can not lay the blame entirely at genetics as some level of personal responsibility must come into it. In my humble opinion. :) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Don&#039;t forget that for some people becoming an addict is not as big a deterrent as it is for others. Even if it&#039;s only on a subconscious level, some people are just self destructive. I&#039;m not generalizing about all addicts because each one has their own reasons or circumstances, but it does seem possible to draw a parallel between the self-harmer and some people in the early stages of addiction.
