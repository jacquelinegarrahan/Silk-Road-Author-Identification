				Ha! Same thing happened to me! Last September I had about 2 or 3 BTC left over after delivery, now they&#039;re worth almost $100. Money for nuthin&#039; and the drugs are cheap!

				I wish. The SR didn&#039;t actually take one of my btc transfers. I messaged support, and after a couple days I got my coin. It appreciated in value a little bit, so I&#039;m still happy. But I&#039;d have rather had it after I sent it...

				btc fluctuating so much is pretty crazy, I also made a couple bucks off the rising prices. <br />If I were you I&#039;d order something cheap like 25i or something.

				I&#039;m ashamed to post garbage like this,&nbsp; but I&#039;m a measly à¸¿0.06 short on my next order, anybody willing to help out a bro so I don&#039;t have to exchange another wad of cash to end up with a bunch of BTC sitting around again?&nbsp; I know lately it&#039;s been good on an upward trend, but personally I like to have as little as possible sitting around<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />197iT38PBKTe9fooBj3GoHsZAKngPBqRHe

				Honestly, I would just hold on to it brother.<br /><br />Let it grow and use it for an order that you may need in the future.<br /><br />Or get one of those massive coupons for like $40.<br />I could certainly use one of those.

The price went from 23 dollars, what i bought them at all the way up to 31!<br /><br />You do the math, of course i spent it all already...<br /><br />Should of waited a little longer before ordering

				I never hold on to them for any amount of time for fear of a crash...<br /><br />Waiting a week and seeing the value appreciate enough to buy myself a bonus well as the QP I planned for is awesome,<br />but seeing it crash and losing that money would be a lot worse.<br /><br />So I&#039;m happy to have spare change at the end of day, but I wouldn&#039;t count on having too much more.
