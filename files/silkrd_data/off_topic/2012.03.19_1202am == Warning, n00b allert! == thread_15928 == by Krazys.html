				Like that.<br /><br />A miscommunication with a vender cost me a few $ and now I am doing what I shoulda done in the first place, reading up in the forums. A variety of off line circumstances mean that ordering things from silkroad is an all around better option for me. <br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Flintstone for an excellent starter tutorial. That is exactly what I ended up doing on my own. Silk Road needs Bitcoins. ฿ need Bitcoin exchange. And you need Dwola to fund your exchange account. I had not quite figured out PGP yet; so I thank Fred for that. <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14104.0<br /><br />Thanks to all of you for having and participating in these forums.<br />

				The whole dwolla method seems shady as hell IMO. It asks for your home address, your cell phone number, and your ss# or photo ID. If they were forced by LE to give up that info, wouldn&#039;t they have to?

				+1 on the Dwolla thang. They would absolutely give you up. I had a dodge readily available for that, one which would be waaay more trouble that it&#039;s worth for most folks. <br /><br />There are certainly other, pain in the ass (for me), methods of getting ฿ into ones silk Road account. But with a soon to expire burn-identity on hand, Dwolla was the easy out. <br /><br /><br />Thanks for replying Greg; I am new enough that I don&#039;t have all that much to contribute.<br /><br />&nbsp;I have my very first order on the way (WoooHooo!) and will have more things of worth to write in the forums as I go. I am sticking with reputable venders, but wanted to generate at least a bit of a forum presence to help deter those thta are tempted to prey on n00bs.
