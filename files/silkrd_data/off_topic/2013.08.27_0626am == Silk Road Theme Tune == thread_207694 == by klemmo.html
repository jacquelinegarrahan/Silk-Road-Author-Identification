				This is great, a theme song for the SR. Sometimes I hear the Jeopardy theme in my head when waiting for TOR to connect, sometimes its the theme from Squidbillies. <br /><br />However, as I am an old skool punk raver, it would probably be more appropriate to have a theme with a heavy driving bass line that was danceable.<br /><br />I play music for the most part when I am online. What strikes me as a very appropriate theme song is by KODE IV, &quot;Possessed&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;money, sex, drugs, the devil, I am possessed&quot;. I am also rather partial to Pink Floyd&#039;s &quot;Money&quot;, as a potential theme song.

				I really like the suggestion with the elevator and jeopardy music. It would be wonderfully bizarre if the SR main page would play something like jeopardy music on one day every year.<br /><br />This defines SR pretty much for me after 2 months. (With knowing about bitcoin and through that about SR but not using it for about 1 1/2 yr.<br />I first heard about bitcoins and was really interested in the system and got into the subject for a few days, then months later i read some article mentioning bitcoins and SR, that made the connection but as i said i was not using SR for about 1 1/2 yr. after i found out it existed.)<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe it<br />I had to see it<br />I came back haunted<br /><br />I said goodbye but I<br />I had to try<br />I came back haunted<br /><br /><br />The entire lyrics are fitting for me.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Came Back Haunted&quot; | https://soundcloud.com/nineinchnails/came-back-haunted-2013<br /><br />The throat is deep and the mouth is wide (MDMA Knallerbsenâ¢)<br />Saw some things on the other side (CANNABIS MDMA LSD)<br />Made me promise to never tell (:x)<br />But you know me, I can&#039;t help myself (look what i got, MDMAZING white shards, beautiful quality)<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve got something you have to seee (Hofmann called it his L.S.Deee.)<br />They put something inside of me (those wonderful sellers here)<br />The smile is red and its eyes are black (dilated pupils)<br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be coming back<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe it (still exists)<br />I had to see it (because it&#039;s so fucking beautiful) <br />I came back haunted (the 2013 that&#039;s the way it has to be done vibe)<br /><br />I said goodbye but I (i said goodbye to the possibility of me acquiring high quality products in the sector of cannabis and of getting MDMA at all anytime in the future, then SR came... <br />I had to try (and i)<br />I came back haunted (from the idea, the whole concept, and then later from the possibility of buying LSD)<br /><br />Everywhere now reminding me<br />I am not who I used to be<br />I&#039;m afraid this has just begun<br />Consequences for what I&#039;ve done, yeah<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe it<br />I had to see it<br />I came back, I came back haunted<br /><br />I said goodbye but I<br />I had to try<br />I came back, I came back haunted<br /><br />Just can&#039;t<br />Stop (ordering in the place above the candy store)
