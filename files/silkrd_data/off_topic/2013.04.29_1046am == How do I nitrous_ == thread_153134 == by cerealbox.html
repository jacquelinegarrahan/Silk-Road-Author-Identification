				Haven&#039;t had nitrous since I was like a 6 year old kid, though I don&#039;t think I really remember any drug experience more fondly. What do I have to do to have a good time? It&#039;s been surprisingly difficult getting good info on clearnet. Basically I just gotta buy whipped cream? How much should I buy? I gotta get a thing called a cracker, too, I hear. And balloons? How do I use the cracker? What kind of balloon do I need? Are there alternative ways of doing this?<br /><br />Also, drug combos. What&#039;s it feel like to mix nitrous with various drugs? In particular I&#039;m wondering about K, MXE, Opiates and alcohol. Though MDMA, LSD or whatever are interesting, too.

				Lol.&nbsp; I prefer getting a tank filled with medical grade n2o.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/images/archive/nitrous_cracker4.jpg<br /><br />That&#039;s a whipped cream charger, a cracker, and a balloon.&nbsp; You put the charger in the tracker, put the balloon on the end with the hole/holes, then twice the cracker closed all the way.&nbsp; Then you loosen the cracker up slightly to allow the balloon to fill with air slowly.&nbsp; Then you either pinch the balloon and pull it off and inhale or you pinch the balloon, twist open the cracker, put another charger in and repeat.&nbsp; You can put like 5 chargers in one of those punching balloons like in the picture.<br /><br />For best results, use while rolling on mdma.

				I love to do it!! Use canisters and cracker. fill up ballon, inhale -exhale fast till its gone and enjoy!!!! <br /><br />combo with lsd would be amazing. i dont recommend mixing it with dissociatives like mxe&nbsp; I found the effects to be very similar. No bad interaction just not my cup of tea.

With weed Was best I found (probably after taking mdma / acid / coke / ketamine in addition ... man, OK...I have done some damage in my younger years :S ) . Do it as a bong chaser or primer. <br /><br />I have seem dudes blast the bigger 9 g cartridges into their mouths directly with moto/bicycle tyre CO2 cartridge . You can regulate the flow...poorly...so be careful with that method. <br /><br />Else puncture the end of the cartridge off whilst wearing a glove and inflate a big balloon with the end if you aren&#039;t a total pussy , this is a totally fine method at only the cost of a balloon.<br /><br />good luck. I used to love hippy crack and ended up going Jack&#039;s route of getting the A size bottles of medical nitrous from dentists. Stick with bulbs. Note: dont do that! hahaha. I cant stand the stuff anymore, and everybody HATES a quitter, lets face it ;-)<br /><br />CD8N<br />

I had a fucked up mouth and they gave me some and I didn&#039;t know it was supposed to make me sleepy so I tried to stay up as much as I could and then they gave me more than some and it was awesome. Might have been older than 6 now that I think about it, but definitely before puberty. Really, really young. I haven&#039;t been able to get anyone to give me nitrous since and frankly I never even thought about the whippet thing until recently.

				Well<br /><br />First the crackers SUCK! They get cold, can freeze and damage your hand and you have to use a balloon ( ALWAYS wash out your balloon before uses and it needs to be one of the big punching balloons)<br /><br />Second.. Put out the money and buy a good whipped cream dispenser you can get a nice one on Amazon for around $35 +/- <br /><br />ONLY use the food or medical grade NOT the one for airsoft guns or cars!! <br /><br />Be sure that you are laying down or sitting.. <br /><br />With the dispenser you have no need for the balloon just put on the long attachment, exhale most all of your lungs , inhale and hold as long as you can then exhale as slow as you can take..&nbsp; PLEASE don&#039;t do it back to back to back give at least 5 mins or so in between each hit! You do not want to know the oxygen levels too far out of whack , pass out or make your self ill.&nbsp; The cartridges get VERY cold when you release them into the dispenser anyways, so waiting between hits to change them is good to so you do not damage your hand&nbsp; ....Depending on your lung size you will get one to two hits off each one.. You can try do a 50/50 and you might get 4 out of them.. I like the 80 /20 my self.. (20 being the oxygen left in my lung)&nbsp; You do NOT want to empty your lungs all the way.. YOU NEED OXYGEN! <br /><br />I like LSD, Shoorms, MDMA, M1 or any mix there of with them and some really great trance music.. The audio effect is really weird to say the least..
