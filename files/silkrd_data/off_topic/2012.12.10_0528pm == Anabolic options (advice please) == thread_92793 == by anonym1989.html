				Hi chaps.<br /><br />I left the army in December 2011 after suffering shrapnel wounds to the stomach and arms. After getting back to the UK I had several operations on my intestines to remove fragments of nastiness, and was unable to eat a solid meal for almost three months, being fed high fat and glucose liquids. While in Afghanistan I was around 13stone (about 180lb), but after the operation I dropped to 9stone (around 126lb). It&#039;s been a full year and I&#039;ve only managed to get my weight back up to around 140lbs. <br /><br />The fact is, I&#039;m bored of eating tons of food and not taking anything in. I believe it may be something to do with how my intestines are working (ie, badly). I&#039;ve gone from being pretty large (was 180lbs, 5ft11), and am now just lean, appearing skinny unless topless.<br /><br />I&#039;m no longer in the army so a helping hand from Silk Road doesn&#039;t bother me, as I&#039;m not planning on entering any sporting events, nor will I be getting drug tested any time soon, this is merely for my own personal happiness.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for information from anyone on here who&#039;s taken steroids in the past, preferably in tablet form, as I don&#039;t plan on sticking anything in my arm any time soon. I want to be able to work out just like I used to, take on a very generous diet and be able to maintain a decent body-shape.<br /><br />If anyone can help out, I&#039;d really appreciate it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />~me.

				As most of the posts here are probably going to tell you a pill/tablet ONLY cycle is NOT good for your liver, they dont work and that if you want to maintain real gains you will have to inject. <br /><br />I personally have done tab only cycles on 3 occasions and can say that it is true that you will lose a lot of water weight once you stop taking. It takes about 4 days - 1 week to feel the dbol in your system. I personally still kept a shit a lot of gains from my cycle. I always did give or take 4 weeks on the dbol at a time and never did 2 cycles within ermmmm 6-9 months of each other. Your power in the gym is unreal. What else --- diet is basically what it is all about! Make no mistake here! Split your food into 6 meals instead of 3, if you dont eat for 2 hours i think it is your body starts eating your own fat for energy - called catabolic state i beleive.&nbsp; Id aim for 7-8 hours sleep minimum whilst on the dbol. Digfferent body part every day obviously and smash it! and again FOOD, FOOD, FOOD! <br /><br /><br />Personally side effects were minimum, the only time on all 3 cycles i had a problem was with anger but i was prepared and knew even at the time it was mainly due to the roids as thats not me. I was very frustrated about something. Couldnt take it. Told the people in the room (couple of good friends) exactly this and trashed the room. aha :-) So no real problem for me here either IMO.<br /><br />My advice to you:<br /><br />1. Get a good brand of dbol such as Genesis labs or British Dispensary both sold here on SR. They are also many local contacts in the UK I know of that are far cheaper.<br /><br />2. Work out a good DOSAGE, GYM WORKOUTS, DIET FOR BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER your cycle - I can help you with you as well as the UK cheaper contacts. PM me.<br /><br />3. No matter what make sure you have Clomid and Nolvadex OR/AND HCG on hand before you start if case you get itchy nips. Get some Liv52 (made by Himalaya), Milk Thistle and fish oil tabs all available online in the UK at least try to help your liver whilst taking. NO ALCOHOL! A beer is alright but I wouldn&#039;t do it personally, especially on a tablet only cycle. Smoking weed is ok though from personal experience and others and is a nice way to relax after a massive workout and helped myself with the munchies too.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps as it took way longer the originally expected to reply too....:-)

				I used to lift weights 4-5 times a week for an hour or more a time and never got past 160 really. Back in mid August I&#039;d dropped down to about 140 due to not exercising and being depressed. Then mid-september I started back, but now instead of weights I just do mainly Hindu Pushups and Squats, and my only real supplement I take is Hemp Protein powder now, as opposed to Whey. Since then doing 150-200 of each exercise 3-4 times a week and eating right has brought me up to a lean and muscular 175. I&#039;d recommend staying away from most anabolic steroid type things that involve cycles, as that stuff tends to be hell on your liver and you have to be very cautious about increasing your dose, then easing back down, then waiting another month if you want to do another cycle. There&#039;s also bound to be increased irritability and stress, but if you want a great way to punish your hairline, penis size, digestive tract, and see plenty of zits, you can&#039;t go wrong with roids. Look into natural test boosters like Yohimbine or products that give you a pump/increased blood flow. They offer good results without the risks.
