				What are everybody&#039;s thoughts on the occupy movement? Love it? Hate it? Are you taking part or do you know somebody who is taking part?<br /><br />I admire and applaud the unity and courage of the people taking part. However, I believe the majority of the movement are ill informed on the true causes of the current socioeconomic mess and so I choose not to take part.

				Jesus Christ people are still talking about this shit?<br /><br />Seriously, what do these &quot;occupiers&quot; want? They want people to give away their hard earned money or something? I don&#039;t get it. I frankly don&#039;t care because it doesn&#039;t affect me. And I don&#039;t believe it affects either extreme ends of the spectrum: billionaire wealthy, or homeless-on-the-street poor. I&#039;m the latter, so it really doesn&#039;t make a difference to me because I won&#039;t get anything out of their success or failure.

				They are the liberal and ineffective version of the tea party. Their only strategy besides being a general nuisance is to bait police officers (just as an aside, fuck the pigs) into committing questionable acts and claiming it as the equivalent of genocide. It&#039;s just a bunch of spoiled kids rebelling without a true cause.

				I&#039;m gunning for the one percent.&nbsp; by that I mean to join their ranks in perpetuity!&nbsp; If everything I do are voluntary interactions with other peaceful people, hitting the 1% means you are making a fuck-load of people&#039;s lives that much the better.&nbsp; You should be proud.
