				Came into a large sum of money online. In a few bank accounts. It may, or may not, be illicit. And I wanted to turn that number on my monitor into cash in my safe. Cold. Hard. Cash. <br /><br />I was thinking of using bitcoins (Even though I lose a lot of money through interest and am not sure if there&#039;s a bitcoin exchange that can process huge orders). Get XXXXXX amount of bitcoin. Send to XX amount of bitcoin wallets. Clean each of those individually with BTC fog. Then use the same exchange (or a different one) to send WU for each individual wallet. <br /><br />I do realize that I would probably have to go to a bunch of different WU agents.<br /><br />After looking around online, I find that using WU, i&#039;d probably lose roughly 8% all together.<br /><br />What do the wise people of tSR think of this method?<br /><br />I know this forum is generally for drug use, etc, but honestly, I feel as if I&#039;ll get a better, if not less hostile, response here than HackBB or tBMR.

				You could easily split the coins up to a dozen different sites all under the ID limit and cash yourself out instead of one giant purchase. Then advertise you will sell bitcoins for cash locally in your city, and get the money back in untraceable cash. <br />Could also accept moneypak for the bitcoins, and just cash out ATM cards though risky. For $900 you can buy an offshore anonymous corporation in Belize or somewhere with a bank account and withdraw through ATM at your leisure.<br /><br />Can also make multiple Okpay accounts and just dump money there, wires are only like 1% to receive or less. <br />Comes with ATM card<br /><br />This is assuming it&#039;s money nobody will ask for it back, meaning you sold drugs or something and that&#039;s your profits. It&#039;s not stolen bank accounts and you&#039;re sending outbound wires from accounts you don&#039;t own. If that&#039;s the case you have to obviously go to a carding forum and hire cashout guy&#039;s at huge percentage
