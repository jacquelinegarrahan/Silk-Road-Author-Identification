				http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_War<br /><br />The first time I did mushrooms with a couple of friends a few years ago, we were all sitting on the couch laughing our asses off about random stuff. One of them suddenly launched himself from the couch towards my computer as if he had seen the light, downloaded this game and started playing it. Well, there we suddenly had an entirely new episode going on. It suddenly came to my mind and I felt the urge to share it!<br /><br />It&#039;s tetris-like low-budget, and you&#039;re bored to shit after playing it a couple times. But you can&#039;t go by without having tried it. Really. Preferably on psychedelics.<br /><br />Has anyone else ever played this? ;D

				Haha that looks like fun I have to try it sometime. I think horror games are fun on psychs because your body reacts as if you were in them. I remember watching my friend playing Silent Hill: The Room and we were on acid, it was the scariest thing ever lol I remember we were both sweating from being so anxious.<br /><br />
