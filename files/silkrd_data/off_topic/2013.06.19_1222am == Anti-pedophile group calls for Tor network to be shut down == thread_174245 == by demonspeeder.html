				the choice between freedom and slavery is not so easy, if it was we would have had freedom a long time ago. The question is: do you accept groups who you don&#039;t agree with to engage in their activities or do you choose a government that has the power to control the internet? What do you fear more: pedophiles or government with unlimited power? The fact of the matter is that pedophiles and others you accuse of engaging in &quot;cruelty&quot; will never go away. Either you accept it or you give government the power to try and control it.&nbsp; <br /><br />most people actually fear freedom because freedom means living in world full of risks. most people prefer a world of security in which the government controls the risk and looks after your every move.

But in all seriousness, I don&#039;t need to post a 50 book length post. It is not surprising at all that uneducated and emotional anti child porn crusaders would pressure Russia to take action that would victimize dissidents in a misguided attempt to make engaging in completely legal behavior that they disagree with impossible, while ignoring the fact that Russians don&#039;t need Tor to go to CP sites due to the fact that CP is not illegal in Russia and that the Russian version of Facebook has as much CP on it as Tor does. Whatever lets them pat themselves on the back for thinking they protected children I guess. Of course it is worth noting that countries with legalized child porn possession have significantly lower rates of child molestation, so it is a bit strange to me that this anti-pedophile group apparently wants to pressure Russia into causing more children to be molested, but thankfully for all of the Russian children people in Russia don&#039;t need Tor for CP and therefor only dissidents will be harmed, not pedophiles or children.

I wouldn&#039;t want the government to have more excuses for tapping into our personal information or for any other country to follow suit with the NSA.&nbsp; All in all, the group is asking much more than they even know to occur which is understandable, considering the subject, yet I find myself answering your question with &quot;no&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although in the back of my head, I am all for destroying pedos globally (sometimes even in disregard for privacy).

				Drugs are only hurting myself if anybody.<br /><br />Child porn oftentimes ruins the lives of individuals depicted within them. Note that I define CP as being pornographic images of actual children (Perhaps around 14 and under), not of teenagers who have the capacity to understand the consequences of capturing themselves in pixels and face the same risks adults do in regards to pornographic images of themselves. Those akin to Amanda Todd deserve no sympathy for their poor life-choices. Meanwhile, a close friend of mine who was raped numerous times in his single digits by a guy who was never charged, and grew up to become a pedophile himself, deserves sympathy.<br /><br />Preferably we&#039;d have a TOR with no child porn, and no individuals who had a sexual compulsion to touch children. However, I cannot think of a practical way to create such a TOR; it&#039;s likely impossible.

				They are only fooling themselves if they think it would change anything.&nbsp; Porn finds a way, unfortunately with CP this is also the case.&nbsp; While TOR is the most popular anonymity network, there&#039;s plenty of others out there like i2p and freenet.&nbsp; The hidden wiki has a good page on these alternatives http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/List_of_Anonymous_Networks .&nbsp; Maybe one day silkroad will migrate off TOR.

Also I find it amazing that you don&#039;t sympathize with Amanda Todd considering she was extorted for sex pictures by some dude on the internet she sent a picture of her flashing to (after he manipulated her into doing so), and when she refused to send more pictures he spammed her shit all over the internet and then she got picked on so much at school that she killed herself. So your policy is no looking at pictures of naked people below the age of 14, but it is okay to extort people older than that for sexual pictures and then spam them all over the place until they kill themselves? That is so weird because my belief is about the exact opposite, that it is okay to *look* at whatever you want, but it is not okay to manipulate kids into sending you sexual pictures and then blackmailing them with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Manipulating kids into sending you sexual pictures and then blackmailing them for more = bad<br />Looking at pictures of kids who were manipulated into sending sexual pictures that were posted on the internet = morally neutral <br />Getting pictures of kids who who posted sexual pictures on the internet and then blackmailing them for more = bad<br />Looking at pictures of kids who posted sexual pictures on the internet = morally neutral <br /><br />Note that in the cases I labeled as bad that a victim is inherently created, and that in the cases I labeled as morally neutral that there is not an inherent ability for the previously created victim to become aware of the fact. By the time somebody views such an image on the internet, any potential victim was already created, and barring some quantum entanglement like phenomenon, no further victimization is inherently taking place. Also make note of the fact that it is illegal to extort anybody regardless of their age. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174245.msg1263070#msg1263070">Quote from: iLoveTaffy on June 22, 2013, 08:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174245.msg1253199#msg1253199">Quote from: kmfkewm on June 19, 2013, 10:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MOSCOW, June 18 (RAPSI) - Sergei Zhuk, the leader of the Bounty Hunters, a group that aims to combat pedophilia through the detection of child pornography, has asked Russia&#039;s Interior Ministry and communications agency Roskomnadzor, to restrict access to the anonymity network known as Tor, Izvestia reports on Tuesday.<br /><br />The Tor software enables online anonymity by directing traffic through a worldwide volunteer network which makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity.
