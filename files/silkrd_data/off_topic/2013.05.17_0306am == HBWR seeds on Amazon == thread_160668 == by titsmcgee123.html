I will likely garner more negative karma for this, but I will answer you honestly. I was merely lurking on the forums late last night, quite tired, but I could not sleep because I was having allergy problems and my eyes itched horribly. I found this thread and decided to read it. For whatever reason the OP just rubbed me the wrong way. First, the premise of the question is, should I do something perfectly legal, implying that there may be some sort of problem if he were to purchase a legal item. It just seems like common sense to me that doing legal things should not be a problem. So I am automatically feeling that this person lacks even basic reasoning skills. Second, using the phrase &#039;slanging bud&#039; just comes across as either immature or of poor influence (the types of people who I have personally known who used this phrase are not people I would associate with). Third, the OP claims that his &#039;house has been on watch&#039; which is extraordinarily unlikely and quite probably an exaggeration. Either the OP feels he is far more important than he really is, or wants readers to think that he is. The alternative is that his house really is &#039;on watch for slanging bud,&#039; we can reasonable assume this is a result of poor choices in the past...<br /><br />As it turns out every subsequent post by this person has further perpetuated my initial inclination. Next post included more paranoia about the local police having nothing to do but watch his house and talk about his house when they aren&#039;t too busy monitoring his doorstep or any parcels he may receive in the mail. Then goes on to claim that his brother &#039;will bake in his car in the middle of the driveway at 3pm.&#039; When I called him on the fact that it is completely illogical for his home to be &#039;on watch&#039; and for his brother to be &#039;baking in the driveway at 3PM.&#039; He went on to claim that you could use illegal drugs in full view of police and the could not do anything as long as you are on your own property. Finishing off this hopefully comical statement (except he was dead serious) he uses a word that has no place in today&#039;s society. Further exemplifying my original impression that this person is of low intellect and poor character. He quickly follows this up by using the word &#039;ignorant,&#039; a very commonly misused word by exactly the type of people who I have come to associate this person with, in exactly the way which it is so commonly misused. <br /><br />So that pretty well wraps it up where we are. I suppose I could have just clicked out of the thread and not replied. Although, my initial reply was more or less harmless. My second reply wasn&#039;t exactly nice, but it just felt like this poor soul needed a wake up call to help him realize that there is a big world out there, and if the paranoia he was experiencing was true his brother would not be able to do what he claims he does. I suppose he is so wrapped up in his delusion that these facts don&#039;t matter and he will believe irrational things to maintain the insanity in his head. The police will arrest you, on your property or not, if you are using illegal drugs in their view.
