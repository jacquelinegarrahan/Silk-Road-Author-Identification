				Hi guys,<br /><br />My own fault I know but I gave out some product on credit to a few so-called friends, however they dont seem to want to pay back!<br /><br />Is there a sensible way you could get it back, like getting a fake driving license on SR and somehow obtaining credit or something anonymously? <br /><br />Roughing someone up wouldnt be a good idea, I like to keep a low profile, also there is a chance they may snitch on you!<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t normally look to do anything like this but it annoys me when you do someone a favour and they don&#039;t want to pay you back, also say they have no money then you hear of them out partying in town spending loads!<br /><br />

				Stealing their identity is sensible? If you&#039;re willing to steal from them, then just steal from them. <br /><br />But no, there is no sensible way to get your money, other than asking them for their money. You&#039;re right, it&#039;s your fault, and you just have to learn from your mistake. Hopefully, one day, they will come to their senses and do the right thing.

				After you&#039;ve asked them for the money back til you&#039;re blue in the face, forget it.<br /><br />Next time don&#039;t be so trusting. I mean with relative strangers. If it&#039;s someone you love, then it wouldn&#039;t enter into it.

				... I don&#039;t understand what a fake driver&#039;s license would do for you?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; You mean you have their personal information and you want to get a loan in their name?&nbsp; Yeah, that won&#039;t work.&nbsp; You&#039;d need their social security number at the very least, I think -- provided you&#039;re in the States, of course.<br /><br />Sometimes people get trapped in one course of action, because they made an initial mistake and they keep compounding it time and time again to avoid that initial one.&nbsp; Maybe that has something to do with it.&nbsp; Remove that difficulty for your friend somehow, and you may get your money back in a hurry.&nbsp; It&#039;s very hard to admit you&#039;re in the wrong: often just admitting it to yourself is hard enough, let alone someone else.<br /><br />They may also not have it.&nbsp; Stories of going out and spending loads aren&#039;t always reliable.&nbsp; For example, credit cards let you hang yourself and look like a bigshot, if you&#039;re into that sort of thing.&nbsp; For awhile it works... maybe that&#039;s all it is.

				No I am in UK, I know they have the money, they have good jobs and also go out partying weekly, go on holidays etc, this just rubs it in your face a bit! If they were poor and struggling to get by day to day I would never think about doing something to get money back I would take it on the chin and leave it and move on.<br /><br />Could call it stealing I guess, but it is simular to what a loan company would do if you didnt pay back loan they would take your possessions and sell at auction. <br /><br />The idea would be something like open up a mail order account, get some products shipped to a dead drop, pick them up and sell them and get money back that way.<br /><br />Sensible?? Probably not, but if I was 100% sensible and law abiding citizen I wouldn&#039;t be on Silk Road! :)

				tell them they&#039;ve got 4 hours or you&#039;re going to go round and demand the money back from their parents. i did that when someone tried to dodge paying me when i was selling, had my cash back within the hour 8)<br /><br />mine was an empty threat but it worked, it&#039;s up to you whether you actually make a move on it or not<br /><br />EDIT: actually find where their parents live before you make the threat, if they call your bluff send them a picture of the house

				Just keep asking for it as often as you think is necessary. At a certain point, you&#039;re surely wasting your time chasing a bad debt. I&#039;m not sure I understand the sense in developing an elaborate plot to get your funds back.

Go over to one of their houses, Wait somewhere hidden, in a bush behind a tree, in a lane, whatever and when they walk past sneaky the prick, Just clock him in the back of the head with a bat or brick or whatever. carefull not to kill him though, Few hits to the back may do fine. <br />As long as you sneaky him, He cant say it was you, Never saw your face , a defence lawyer would have a field day if they did snitch.<br />Say &quot;your name here&quot; wants his cash back now. Phone or money your choice, or il go into your house right now and take what i want plus intrest dickhead.<br /><br />Sounds harsh, but i have been there done that, and when they are doing to you what they have done to me, you are better to just get it over with. Its easier than it sounds, Once you have done it youl be like &quot;well that was easy&quot;. I have an old &quot;friend&quot; that did this too me and i never fucking kicked the shit out of him and i regret it to this day, seriously. I actually get pissed even thinking about it, i wish i had just stabbed the fucking life out of him lol. <br /><br />anyways mate. hope you get it back

				Have a stern word with them face to face.<br /><br />Rock up at their house at random times of the day if theyre not answering phone, speak to whoever answers the door and tell them its an urgent personal matter.<br /><br />If all else fails, do the moneys worth of damage to their property and unfriend them.

Stop asking them for a while to make it seem as though you&#039;ve given up or forgotten, and then out of the blue offer them a (very tempting) deal on another product. When they show up to make the purchase, take whatever money they bring and explain you&#039;re applying it to their debt, and that the product will be another £XXX - but this time no fronting. :)

				1) it depends how much/it depends on if you can write it off.<br />2) depends on what you want to be known as, the guy that can get taken advantage of vs the guy that shit kicked me over 40 bucks.<br /><br />If it&#039;s a small amount then there are plenty of suggestions on here of how to possibly recover some of the funds. but its all a pain in the ass. if you&#039;re really hell bent on &quot;what&#039;s right&quot; then just cost them double in damage. If it&#039;s an amount that you can&#039;t let go (this number changes for different people) and it&#039;s not about the fact that the owe it.

Be sure to discuss that this was either the end of it, or the beginning of it. let them know that if you even think they are carrying this shit on that you&#039;ll see them again. it&#039;s in everyones best interest to let it end here and now.

This all takes time and there will be screaming. It can be done fairly quickly after the initial subduing. i would advice doing it inside, 1 on 1, and putting something in their mouth or covering their face to muffle the sound.

				If you really care more about being low key and not getting your hands dirty I suggest you let it go if you can&#039;t get it the right way. Best bet is to buy a tazer(Non lethal,inexpensive,painful) catch the person at the right moment,zap zap, take their stuff and at least your pride and ego will feel reassured ha. And depending on what they have you might be able to get some of the debt back. Including if they live close to you let them know you will catch them plenty of times and keep taking their belongings until it&#039;s paid. Another good idea but risky would be to try to rob their house, but that would require great work and great risk.

				I would just like to throw out a little support for roundhead. His method wouldn&#039;t be mine but his method succeeded for him/her. <br /><br />The truth is there are many &quot;right&quot; ways to handle this depending on many factors. Whatever gets the job done to the degree you want it done is right. <br /><br />There are also many wrong ways, in fact there are many more wrong ways than right ways. the wrong ways will involve the possibilities of you being visited by the police and charged (being visited if you did it right shouldn&#039;t matter and even if you did things perfectly they may show up at your door step. be ready for that), possibilities of retribution, or having your property damaged or people you care about being hurt. All of this of course depends on what you do, and what these people that owe you do. <br />The wrong way will doubtfully give you a second chance and may even cost you a great deal. keep that in mind. do it right the first time. <br /><br />At any rate roundhead I see you catching a little flack &quot;you&#039;re a coward&quot; and though you&#039;re way isn&#039;t mine it was successful in achieving your goals. I say good on you.
