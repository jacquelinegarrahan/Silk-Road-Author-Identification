				I&#039;m curious. What is the most BTC you have lost due to losing your password, file, or however you lost it. I haven&#039;t lost any (yet) but I see how easy it could be if not careful. Years ago I once sent a guy $800 on WebMoney but he was kind enough to send it back so I didn&#039;t really lose it.

				I&#039;ve never technically lost any and hope never to. Bump because I&#039;m intersted to see how much other people have lost. Maybe it&#039;ll make me feel better from all the money (not BTC) I&#039;ve lost haha

				Props to the guy who sent your $800 back - you got lucky there it seems.. <br /><br />I FREQUENTLY freak out that i&#039;ve made a typo and sent my BTC to the wrong address, but I think its easier said than done to send it to a real address. <br /><br />Out of interest - what happens if you send to an address that doesnt exist?

				Only $20 from bcpltd.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t their fault, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s mine, but it was my first time FE&#039;ing (for cocaine, of course&nbsp; :o ) and it got lost.<br /><br />Luckily, that&#039;s been it.&nbsp; Thought I got made a few times, but I&#039;ve had the divine pleasure of never having to deal with a vendor I don&#039;t think is worth my 5/5.

				My first order on SR was with LucyDrop (who of course told me to FE). Lost around $100 which isn&#039;t too bad but considering it was my FIRST PURCHASE it definitely didn&#039;t give SR a very good vibe for me. I just stayed within escrow for every other transaction I did after that. Definitely taught me a lesson, that&#039;s for sure 8)

				Scamming is something else. I mean just lost your file or forgot password or sent to the nether world or whatever. Everytime I transfer BTC and nothing is showing up for first few minutes I&#039;m always thinking &quot;fuck&quot;.

				A friend of a Friend once reformatted his hard drive with over 3,200 bitcoins on it. He got involved in bitcoin mining like the first day it was possible and let his miner go for a long while. He lost interest in bitcoin for the next few years because they never really took off, they were still trading for nickels and dimes when he stopped mining. Without looking at the current rate of BTC he reformatted the hard drive that had his wallet on it. He reformatted when they were trading around 160 bucks...worst decison of his life.
