				I cannot see how people can listen to mainstream music today and go crazy about it.&nbsp; Music has gone so far downhill with songs like &quot;Throw Some D&#039;s&quot;, &quot;Miss New Booty&quot;, &quot;Get Low&quot;, &quot;Let&#039;s Go&quot;, &quot;I.N.D.E.P.E.N.D.E.N.T. and stuff like Hannah Montana and the Jonas Brothers..

				Gotta agree with SeatTeam6 here. The shallow music reflects our shallow society. I personally haven&#039;t listened to popular music in a very long time. Its sad. Back in the day, popular music was actually good and has stood the test of time (think Temptations, Marvin Gay, Elvis...). I highly doubt any of the garbage out today will be looked upon fondly in 40 or 50 years. <br /><br />No wonder the record industry is in shambles

				You obviously have never sat down with DAW software and tried to use it. It is not &quot;easy&quot; to make electronic music and your ignorant dismissal of an entire genre&#039;s artists as not being skilled is offensive. It&#039;s not as though you can just load up Ableton and arrange some beeps and boops and call it a song; you really have to know how to write music just as much as if you were writing a piano or guitar song.

				When these artists go on stage though is it something they already put together and they just repeat it, or are they up there creating brand new patterns of sound?&nbsp; I do have a bad habit of calling music i dont like shit, but doesnt music you dont like sound like shit to you?&nbsp; Theres just something about going to a concert and seeing the band creating brand new music right in front of your eyes thats magical.&nbsp; Just not the same as watching someone type on a computer(no matter how hard it may be).&nbsp; I could give them some respect if they get up there and improvise though.&nbsp; Any idiot can repeat something a million times

				What&#039;s more important than skill in playing instruments is skill in composing and arranging. That&#039;s what really makes a good song, and it&#039;s necessary whether a live band or a DAW is being used.
