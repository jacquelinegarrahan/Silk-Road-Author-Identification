				While this is a fear campaign and &quot;80%&quot; of cocaine is not contaminated, levamisole is a real problem, and it is in a reasonable amount of coke currently in circulation in the US. A way to test for this would be appreciated, though I trust the sellers on SR to not sell contaminated product.

Using it to cut coke is a cruel thing to do. If you goggle it it appears to be an easy thing to find.
