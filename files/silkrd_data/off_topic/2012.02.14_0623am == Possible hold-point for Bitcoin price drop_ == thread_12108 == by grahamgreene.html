				The following are not my own words; they&#039;re taken verbum pro verbo from a respected member of a Bitcoin forum who makes excellent predictions (and likely a shedload of money from his pattern-recognition savvy!&nbsp; 8))<br />They&#039;re posted for everybody, but particularly for people who may not use other Bitcoin forums to keep up to date on the Bitcoin market and Bitcoin news.<br /><br />&quot;Interestingly enough, if you compare the magnitudes of each rally and assume that they will drop as much as the first rally as a magnitude of the percentage, you get a &quot;perfect&quot; estimate of a 33% drop from our high of $7.22, bringing us down to $4.81.<br /><br />...God damn 33% percent retracement rule.&quot;<br /><br />Context: This was posted on February 6th, after some market turmoil. The price currently (07.36 GMT) is sitting at a high of $5.55 and a low of $4.81. At the moment, a very accurate prediction!<br /><br />So let&#039;s continue business as usual and pray to Jah, God, Allah, The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Trees, The Sea, Mother Earth, Satoshi and the great Dread Pirate Roberts that he&#039;s right about a $4.81 stabilisation!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				So now 4.81 is gonna be the &#039;normal&#039; price? It&#039;s not gonna go back to like 7? I have 25 BTC I paid like 6-6.40 each for... :(

				I make around .9 bitcoins a day on average. (24hr period)<br /><br />Like I said, it&#039;s not much... but it&#039;s completely anonymous and easier than dealing with mtgox, dwolla, etc. <br /><br />Bitcoin mining isn&#039;t a profitable venture, IMO. <br /><br />It&#039;s kind of addictive though. Squeezing every last MH/s out of your rigs is kind of fun.

I also can&#039;t imagine more panic-selling / panic-buying (the lack of which would keep prices relatively stable) until prices drop down close to $3.20 because the new psychological barrier seems to be set at the $3 mark.<br /><br />All this being said, I&#039;m no expert and am basing my deductions on the opinions of people who seem to have a decent track record in Bitcoin speculation. Personally, I have great faith in Bitcoin as a future currency, and have no doubt that the prices will soar in the future - perhaps even by the end of the year. I&#039;ll be buying as much as possible at current prices as an investment, and will be buying as needed to fund my purchases on here.<br /><br />As for worrying about your 25 BTC at $6 - 6.40 a piece, in a couple years those 25 BTC might be able to buy you a house!&nbsp; :P I bought a large amount when prices were at $3.32 and almost doubled the amount of USD value that I had in my account over a period of 2 weeks, so the volatility of the market worked well for me in that case; my advice to anyone worrying about their current coin value is to read up as much as possible about the state of the markets / recent Bitcoin news etc. over at bitcointalk.org on the clearweb and always plan for the worst case scenario. Expect the worst and anything else is automatically good news!<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I made a huge amount over the course of 2 weeks, but could&#039;ve lost an equally huge amount over the course of 3 days due to the price dropping. That&#039;s the thing about Bitcoin - when it crashes, it crashes big! And recovery generally takes a period of up to 9 weeks.<br /><br />Market manipulators are the ones to watch out for, and ironically, they&#039;re the ones you CAN&#039;T watch out for - they dump a huge amount of coins onto the market at once to try push the price lower, then buy up more at the lower prices. The first time this happened there was a relatively small amount of coins dumped onto the market and things went crazy - the last time there was over a 100K BTC dumped and there was very little market movement, which would indicate speculators are becoming much less affected by huge dumps like this, and Bitcoin is stabilising somewhat as a commodity (most speculators would see Bitcoin as a commodity to make money off rather than as a currency to purchase goods and services with, at least in the short term.)<br /><br />The 100K BTC dropped by the manipulator which failed to impact the market then brought a second, larger manipulator out of the shadows who managed to successfully push the price down, and buying up more coins. I can&#039;t see this happening again for another 2 - 3 months as the manipulators will likely be attempting to examine each others most probable strategies, now that the smaller manipulator knows there is someone larger out there.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12108.msg118397#msg118397">Quote from: pine on February 19, 2012, 03:45 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please don&#039;t waste your time trying to predict currency movements.

Bitcoins are, for the most part (to speculators) a commodity which is traded or hoarded in order to produce a profit at the sale-point. The relatively successful Bitcoin currency trader needs to be completely up to date with the speculation of Bitcoin as a commodity in order to maintain that success.<br /><br />- graham greene
