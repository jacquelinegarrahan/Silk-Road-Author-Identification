				I would like to know the rules....that when a vendor threatens an SR buyer with his life, etc, will SR do anything about it?<br /><br />Now its not me, but someone from this forum exposed this vendor as a scam. And a damn scam he is to.<br /><br />So, when this scamming vendor has threatened someone...can they, or will they be possibly banned from vending again?<br /><br />They have exposed this leech of a vendor, who has been making money from idiots hoping for a wet dream.<br /><br />Any vendor who threatens anyone should be banned from ever vending again.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				YES, ABSOLUTELY!&nbsp; If a vendor is threatening a buyer, that is taken VERY seriously by SR admins.&nbsp; Please encourage the buyer to report these threats immediately!

				Thanks Scout i have done.<br /><br />These threats have made him start to move house.<br /><br />These threats were rather quite nasty....the scam vendor knew which vendor the buyer recently ordered from, so he offered that vendor money for his mailing addresses for SR orders.<br /><br />This has to stop. To think people not only have the audacity to sell a scam, they start to believe in it when they are making money from it.<br /><br />If this vendor even trys to send me a PM after reading this, i&#039;ll send it straight to SR.<br /><br />YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.<br /><br />

				I made a sample purchase a while back was honest gave a 4/5 rating 4/5 due to POOR packaging.<br />Long story short he said im messing up his feedback when he did nothing wrong and proceeded to tell me he will ban me if i dont fix it. I changed it because i really dont want to be blackmailed because some vendor cant package properly.<br />I was told the stealth issues were fixed and proceeded to test it out with another sample.<br />Not only was it exact the same BUT there was a hair in it and it was vac sealed to the little baggie with awful hand written scribble.. <br />I made it be known in feedback and left 5/5 even tho i honestly feel it isnt deserved..<br />I just dont want to get banned.

Because he did it twice after promising you the level of packaging would be raised, i&#039;d give 4/5 again for the first, and 3/5 for the other.<br /><br />If vendors want to play that game, well they are simply outnumbered and will soon have no customers, or hardly any sales.<br /><br />Adjust the feedback and find another vendor who is actually on the ball and gives a shit. ;)
