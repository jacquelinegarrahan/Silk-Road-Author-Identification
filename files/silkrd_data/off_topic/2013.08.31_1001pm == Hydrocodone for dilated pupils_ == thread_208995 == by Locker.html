				As some of you know I still live with my mother until I can get enough money to move out. I try do E as much as I can but my pupils are extremely sensitive to dilation and even If I don&#039;t feel the high my pupils dilate massively. I have been caught doing E before and she always looks at my eyes and would definitely ask even if they were slightly dilated. On e and many other drugs my pupils will stay dilated for at least 24 hours after dosing, so I came across a post mentioning the use of Hydrocodone/Vicodin for the use of dilated pupils that will help contract them at least a little. I will not be taking these while high, but more several hours after the high when I would be seeing my mother. Do you think this will work? Is the contraction of pupils simply an uncommon side effect or is it reliable enough? I don&#039;t think anything would work while I&#039;m high but I am unable to go home even a day after the roll/trip. If not then are their any alternatives? I don&#039;t think contacts will work either as I have one eye a different colour to the other&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />If so, what dosage would work for this purpose? Would it be similar to Valium and make me feel spaced out and tired? <br />How great that the only small quantity vendor is KetamineOcean&nbsp; :( However I have heard that has fairly good reviews/reliability when it comes to small quantity pill orders, and not the 10 pounds of weed though, so if this is an option<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Locker.

				Any opiate is good to contract your pupils, but I know for most you have to take a fair dose, you cant expect a little bit to work. Also I presume it would have to be enough to overpower your already dilated pupils.<br /><br />It might work though, only one way to find out. Opiates are very good for comedowns too, so this might work in a two fold.

What sort of dosage would be good? Because I have no tolerance with opiates or benzos so don&#039;t really want to be feeling spaced out and high from them lol.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Locker.

				Don&#039;t take benzos, you want opiates. I am not to sure about opiates except for oxycodone, which you would need 5mg+ I would say.&nbsp; The high from opiates is great when you are coming down though, as I said. Makes the day a lot more pleasant.

Opiates are very effective for pupil contraction, but some need more then other; if you take a high enough dose your pupils will defiantly contract.

				Yeah I understand that they are fairly different but it&#039;s just I have plenty of Tramadol/valium/magnacet around the house and just class them all as prescription pills lol.<br />Seems like a fairly good idea, I plan to buy some shrooms fairly soon so will be giving it a go then.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Locker.
