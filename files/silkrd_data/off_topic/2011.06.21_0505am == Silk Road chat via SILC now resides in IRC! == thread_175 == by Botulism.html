				Lol nomad, you know dem junkies. Paranoid as all hell. :P(don&#039;t get offended by this) Anway, if you go into &quot;view profile&quot; of say...anyone who didn&#039;t generate their key somewhere other than pidgin, can you tell me which piece of information can easily identify him? when I view a profile I see nothing that indicates who they are at all. Maybe yLG9bvB0eBq4 could give some insight into what identifies you, he&#039;s our resident SILC expert it appears. ;)

				I&quot;m not too worried about username being the same across tor...I think sometimes we pay too much attention to the middle of the transaction, and not near enough to the tail end.&nbsp; We B small fry: most dangerous territory is the last foot and five minutes of any transaction.&nbsp; I love messing with linux and virtual boxes and tor and gpg--I love Tails---and I know it&#039;s important...but somebody, somewhere, has to get my info...and that&#039;s the weak link...that, or me getting stupid some night in a bar, and just *having* to show off my knowledge to the crew around me: a week later one of them gets popped, decides to sell me down the river and it&#039;s over...no matter *how* much encryption I use.&nbsp; Its a weird new world, but some things never change.

				&gt; You only have to release information you want to release. Quit making posts in my thread.<br />No. That was my point. By default on Windows it FORCES you to release your hostname which is a huge vulnerability. I&#039;m simply trying to keep people safe, you&#039;re the one who should quit making posts.<br /><br />&gt; I&quot;m not too worried about username being the same across tor<br />Even if you access via Tor, by default it still reveals your REAL hostname, thus defeating the whole purpose of Tor in the first place.

				What I&#039;d like to know is where it shows your hostname, I&#039;m sorry I got annoyed but the issue of pidgin was already solved by yLG9bvB0eBq4. &quot;For Windows:<br />- Download cygwin version of the client: hxxp://silcnet.org/download/client/cygwin/silc-1.0.exe.zip<br />- run &quot;silc -C&quot; to generate a keypair. follow instructions and enter bogus username and hostname<br />- put the new keys in your silc directory replacing your old private and public key<br />- chat away&quot; <br /><br />All you&#039;re doing is making people paranoid without telling them HOW to fix the issue. If you want to keep people safe, fine. but at least tell them HOW to stay safe.

				It still appears to be down, I am unable to connect. Well, glad it&#039;s not just me. As for the question about step 7, you have to be connected to the server to be able to do so it seems. Otherwise it says &quot;no actions available&quot; So if you&#039;re new to the chat, you&#039;ll have to wait til the server reconnects I&#039;m afraid.

				Guys, <br /><br />I think I have a room we can use for the time being.&nbsp; This is on a jabber service that is a tor hidden service.

The room does not log messages.&nbsp; In order to support public key encryption for communication during private messages make sure to download the Pidgin OTR (off the record) plugin and enable it after installation in the plugin list. <br /><br />ADD a new account in Pidgin:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; protocol: XMPP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; username: whatever username you want<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; domain: ch4an3siqc436soc.onion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; password: whatever password you want<br />Advanced tab:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; connection security: user encryption if available<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; connect port: 5222<br />Proxy tab:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Proxy Type: (tor/privoxy) socks5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; host: 127.0.0.1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; port: 9050 (this assumes you are using the default port for tor, 9050, if you changed the tor port change the port here as well)<br /><br />You may need to tick the &quot;Create this new account on the server&quot; if you&#039;re logging in to this server for the first time.<br /><br />Setup OTR (off the record, public key encryption for private messages to users on this server/room) :<br /><br />Get the OTR plugin here hxxp://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/index.php#downloads (link broken to prevent referrer info being sent to the webserver)<br />After install go to the Pidgin menu-&gt;tools-&gt;plugins and scroll down to &quot;Off the record Messaging&quot;<br />click the checkbox to enable, highlight the plugin then click &quot;configure&quot;<br /><br />config tab:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; key for account: hit the pulldown menu and select the XMPP account you created <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; click &quot;generate&quot; this will generate the public key pair that will be used for encryption when talking to users in PM on the server<br />Default Otr settings:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;check &quot;enable private messaging&quot; and &quot;automatically initiate private messaging&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;this way when two people both have otr configured the encryption will happen automatically.<br /><br />Enable this XMPP account<br />Pidging menu, Buddies-&gt;Join a chat, select the XMPP account for this server<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;room: silkroad<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;server: chat.ch4an3siqc436soc.onion<br /><br />alternatively from the join chat popup you can click the &quot;room list&quot; button and when it asks for the server put in chat.ch4an3siqc436soc.onion then list rooms and the silkroad room should be up there<br /><br />Again chats are NOT logged on the server and communication via pm will use public key encryption via the OTR plugin. You do not need to worry about using your SR public key for OTR, it will generate a new public key pair used soley for PMing that automatically initializes when two people are using OTR.<br /><br />I thin this would be a decent server for the time being. Please let me know if you have any trouble joining the chat or setting up OTR.<br /><br />0ctal<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Well of course LEO considers all this OS intel, for all we know they admin the .onion xmpp. Just watch what you say. I&#039;ve definitely heard some shit in chat that could narrow down the possibilities of who a vendor is in meatspace.&nbsp; With OS intel+process of elimination they can get scary close, the question is how much effort are they really gonna put into this. We aren&#039;t talking about the CSIS here. <br /><br />How many people do you think the RCMP DEC has that specialize in humint? How about the DEA? How many resources are they willing to waste on this? <br /><br />How much do you EU peeps got to fear? Polina Grafova was on Interpols most wanted list for 1 year before being extradited. She did have terrible Opsec (WU, cleartext) but still I hear all this talk about how it&#039;s just us North American SRer&#039;s that need to worry, but we all need to realize that they can get you without entrapping you (think side-channel)..<br /><br />Wonder how long till the first vendor gets busted. Usually shit like that doesn&#039;t make the news but I have a feeling with past exposure of SR it will definitely be covered by MSM.<br /><br />TL;DR <br />WYA

If you left it blank, you&#039;ll need to leave it blank in the log in as well otherwise it&#039;ll give you this error. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t see anyone moving back to SILC, are we sticking with Jabber? I&#039;d like to go back to SILC simply because of the vulnerabilities of Jabber that have been discussed in this forum as well as the ungodly lag we get with it. SILC has zero lag. Really up to everyone, though.

				MAC SILC TUTORIAL<br /><br />1. install macports from www.macports.org<br />2. sudo port install silc-client<br />3. sudo port install socat<br />4. READ THIS AND GENERATE A NEW KEY:<br /><br />Q: How can I generate a new server key pair?<br />A: You can generate a new key pair using the silcd command with the -C option. When SILC Server is installed a key pair is generated automatically for you. However, it is suggested that you check the information found in that key and generate a new key pair if the information is incorrect. You can check the information of your public key by giving command: silc -S file.pub. <br />&nbsp;<br />If you want to generate a new key pair then you can give for example command: silcd -C . --identifier=&quot;UN=silc-oper, HN=silc.silcnet.org, RN=SILC Router Admin, E=silc-oper@silcnet.org, O=SILC Project, C=SK&quot;. This will create the key pair to current directory, with the specified identifier. Please, give the --help option to the silcd to see usage help for the -C and --identifier options. <br /><br />5. put the following in a script and run it:<br /><br />socat TCP4-LISTEN:4242,fork SOCKS4A:localhost:fxb4654tpptq255w.onion:706,socksport=9050 &amp;<br /><br />6. fire up &quot;silc&quot; from command line then type /server localhost 4242<br />7. /j silkroad<br />8. party!<br /><br />let me know if you have any problems or questions<br /><br />send me fractional bitcoins if you love me: 1KFMftC9aeciB9fMREx8mFotj2ujKVTKTR

				If you&#039;re on SR buying personal amounts then probably you&#039;re not too worried about issues of traceability that come from using chat.<br /><br />However, recently I spoke to someone much more knowledgeable than me and he gave me a very strong lecture about using chat to talk about drugs.<br /><br />The way I understood the explanation: the longer you stay on chat, the more easily someone can trace who you are.&nbsp; And that risk goes up dramatically if you stay on for an extended period because the detection method used is able to eliminate a certain number of possibilities every time you communicate.&nbsp; Stay on long enough and some can locate you for sure!&nbsp; At least that&#039;s the way I understood the explanation.

				Yeah, that&#039;s bullshit.<br />Using SILC over tor is about as safe as it gets. The computing power needed to trace you is just frikken immense, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.<br />The only feasible way for someone to find out who you are, is if you tell him.<br />Also: Make sure not to save log files. THAT GOES FOR EVERYONE! Chatlogs are gold mines for cops. Best is, of course, to also encrypt your HDD.<br /><br />SO DON&#039;T SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION. But that shouldn&#039;t be news.

				I screwed up and generated a key pair too soon or something - i had the thing connected but now i can&#039;t edit settings for accounts that aren&#039;t signed on.. i repeated the whole thing made a new pidgin SILK account did everything but it says &quot;problem with key pair&quot; (something like that).&nbsp; And pidgin wont let you edit an accounts other settings unless your connected.&nbsp; Seems like a pidgin bug. Screw it, jabber always works fine.<br />

				Um, yeah, SILK must suck or most likely, pidgin is just too buddy to use with SILK. <br /><br />I downloaded the latest Tor browser bundle, tried it on windows and in a linux VM.&nbsp; I can connect ONCE.. and i follow the instructions to the tee but once i log off and back on again, says some error about the silk keys or just &quot;connection failed&quot;.&nbsp; Also, when I delete the .silk files, they just reappear when i try to log on again (without me even able to generate new keys because pidgin won&#039;t allow me unless i&#039;m connected.<br /><br />WTF&#039;s wrong with jabber? Pidgin works fine wtih jabbef/tor/chat never had a problem..&nbsp; Pidgin is buggy with other available protocols too some worse than others.&nbsp; SILK sure seems like a buggy one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I shouldn&#039;t have to keep deleting accounts over and over and deleting files spending all this manual labor just to get on a chat room.&nbsp; It works fine in jabber? No 5 hour manual labor involved... why SILK?&nbsp; Never even heard of it before and obviously there are problems and bugs in pidgin with it.&nbsp; <br />

				Here are some fairly simple instructions on using SILC on OSX Lion, based on a previous post about socat. socat seems broken via MacPorts at the moment, but it&#039;s easy to compile manually. Note that if using the Tor browser bundle it will assign a random Tor port every time you start it up, so you may want to install plain Vidalia instead.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">#!/bin/bash<br />#<br /># Install Xcode &amp; MacPorts<br />#<br /># sudo port install silc-client<br />#<br /># Manually build socat-1.7.2.0:<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;wget http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/download/socat-1.7.2.0.tar.gz<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;tar zxvf socat-1.7.2.0.tar.gz<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;cd socat-1.7.2.0<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;./configure<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;make<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp;sudo make install<br />#<br /># WARNING: double-check your ~/.silc/silc.conf and scrub all traces of your name/nick/hostname/etc<br /># /whois yourself once connected to make sure it&#039;s using the right values<br />#<br /><br />socat TCP4-LISTEN:4242,fork SOCKS4A:localhost:fxb4654tpptq255w.onion:706,socksport=9050 &amp;<br />/opt/local/bin/silc -c localhost -p 4242<br /></code><br />Someone should come up with a more elegant script, since socat will stay running in this case if you quit out of silc.

The chat is great quite honestly; the members are helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. It&#039;s also a great place to gossip about sellers/news/etc and who&#039;s bought from who. There are also many sellers that frequent the chat! The server it is located on is fxb4654tpptq255w.onion. Easiest way is to use pidgin to connect to SILC. If you don&#039;t have pidgin, download it! <br /><br />step 1: Go to accounts&gt;manage accounts&gt;add...<br /><br />step 2: Select SILC from the dropdown menu under protocol<br /><br />step 3: Pick a username and password (no registering is needed)<br /><br />step 4: Put fxb4654tpptq255w.onion as your network<br /><br />step 5: Go to advanced tab and also place fxb4654tpptq255w.onion under connect server<br /><br />step 6: Go to proxy tab select SOCKS5 and configure it to use TOR.(Host: 127.0.0.1 Port: 9050) Click save! The account should then connect.<br /><br />**step 7:** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT REVEALS HOSTNAME. After your account is connected go to accounts&gt;your SILC account you just made&gt;create silc key pair...then change the host name, real name, and email to something of your choosing to keep yourself anonymous. <br /><br />Make sure you use the same pass as you did when you created account if you choose to remember password, otherwise you wont be able to connect. If you do not scroll down when performing this step to fill in the passphrase boxes, your password will be blank and will not match the password for log on credentials thus making it impossible to load the key pair!<br /><br />Click generate key pair, Set user info and then disable and re-enable the account. Every time you try to create a key pair it&#039;ll put your hostname in the account so be careful when generating key pairs. Make sure to go to accounts&gt;set user info every time you generate a new key pair!<br /><br />step 8: Join the chat! The chat name is silkroad. To join select buddies&gt;join a chat&gt;SILC account and put silkroad as channel name. Press join and that&#039;s all she wrote! Look forward to seeing some new faces in the chat. Sorry if this tutorial is a bit rocky, making tutorials isn&#039;t really my thing...;)<br /><br />****Some pointers for our friends who cannot seem to join the chat*****<br />1 )Make sure the password you set in step 7 matches your password in your log in information.<br />2) Try deleting the account and trying again.<br />3) Find the .silc folder for Pidgin, which is usually in AppData under roaming. AppData is normally a hidden folder, which contained in your user folder so you may have to set windows to show hidden folders.<br />4) Try reinstalling pidgin.<br /><br />If anyone else has some pointers let me know. Good luck!<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nice one Botulism, thank you very much.

				Does anyone know how to fix the &quot;cannot load SILC key&quot; error? I&#039;ve tried reinstalling Pidgin three times, creating new accounts, etc. and nothing seems to work. Alternatively, is there another well-establish SILC client (for Windows) I can use instead of Pidgin? Pidgin is a goddamn shit circus right now. I&#039;m gonna install Colloquy (or whatever it&#039;s called) on my Mac later to see if it at least works, but I&#039;d really prefer to use Windows as my Mac can be a real bitch when it comes to custom connection settings.

				&quot;Mac OS X<br /><br />&nbsp;Download Pidgin<br />2.10.1 Source<br />For a more native Mac OS X experience, you may be interested in using Adium instead, which uses libpurple (the core of Pidgin) for much of its protocol support.<br />For Pidgin on OS X, you may find the packages provided through Fink or Macports more convenient than compiling from source.<br />Please note, we do not provide support for issues related to installing Fink, Macports, or their packages of Pidgin.

I don&#039;t personally understand how to compile what is in the code, since i really normally use a pc but have switched to this macbook. <br /><br />I downloaded Pidgin (as google said it worked with SILC.) When i go to manage accounts and choose a service (i.e. aim,xfire,msn,silc,irc) SILC is not available. I googled for a patch or plugin, and nothing.<br />I tried Coloquy but that always crashes and when i got a version that didnt crash i couldnt figure out how to use it to connect to silc,just irc.<br /><br />Adium was useless for me and i didnt really spend much time using it.<br /><br />so as specific as i can possibly get right now is, How do you either A. Compile the code given in the begining of the thread or B. How do i use pidgin or Adium or Coloquy or Another service to set up SILC on a mac?<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				Hey peeps,<br /><br />So I was looking into joining if the &quot;SILC&quot; is still up? I was looking some where between pages 13-15 and I noticed the download for Pidgin at the homepage said to use Adium. Has anyone with a MAC used this? or did they use their other suggestions of &quot;Fink&quot;/&quot;Macports&quot; OR did you guys go ahead with the last option and &quot;download Pidgin source and compile&quot;? Any help would be great :) I&#039;ve been eyeballing the SR for some time and learning the ropes of encrypting and feeling ready to make my first purchase, and I&#039;d like to chat with other peeps here with experience from vendors. <br /><br />Thanks all

				I compile the silc pidgin and toolkit from silcnet.org at linux mint. Very proud here, as I&#039;m a newbie in this stuffs. I connected to the standard silc server without issues.<br /><br />When I try to connect to anything at pidgin trough tor proxy (sock5 host 127.0.0.1 port 9050) I get a &quot;failed to connect&quot;. Not only silc, but others protocols too. Tried to delete the accounts and .silc folder but didn&#039;t work.<br /><br />My firewall status is off, so probably it is not firewall. Does somebody know how to fix this?<br /><br />Another question: If I&#039;m using Tails/Liberte, I need to change the proxy settings or do Tails/Liberte do that automatically?

				Im at a loss. all I did was restart my computer and now I cant log into silc. It keeps saying <br /><br />&quot;unable to load silc keypair.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;I have tried everything I can think of, deleted profiles, re-added account, re-installed pidgin, tried to use other clients (couldnt find one that also used a proxy so I could tunnel it through tor of course).<br /><br />Thought it was a problem of changing the keypair after first login, its giving me this error even when I know it cant connect to the server (I had the wrong ip at one point when I re-created the account). I know I used the same password I know my passwords very well. I even tried to create a completely new account and again it gave me the same error.<br /><br />&nbsp;I think it is a tor problem, I remember when I first set this all up I had to edit the .torrc settings file to get it to actually listen at 9050. and I had to do some juggling with tor browser and local native vidalia.<br /><br />This is very frustrating as I have come to enjoy the chat very much in the past few weeks. <br /><br />If anyone has had a similar problem I have spent a good portion of this day trying to re-connect please if you have any advice I would greatly appreciate it.

The chat is great quite honestly; the members are helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. It&#039;s also a great place to gossip about sellers/news/etc and who&#039;s bought from who. There are also many sellers that frequent the chat! The server it is located on is fxb4654tpptq255w.onion. Easiest way is to use pidgin to connect to SILC. If you don&#039;t have pidgin, download it! <br /><br />step 1: Go to accounts&gt;manage accounts&gt;add...<br /><br />step 2: Select SILC from the dropdown menu under protocol<br /><br />step 3: Pick a username and password (no registering is needed)<br /><br />step 4: Put fxb4654tpptq255w.onion as your network<br /><br />step 5: Go to advanced tab and also place fxb4654tpptq255w.onion under connect server<br /><br />step 6: Go to proxy tab select SOCKS5 and configure it to use TOR.(Host: 127.0.0.1 Port: 9050) Click save! The account should then connect.<br /><br />**step 7:** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT REVEALS HOSTNAME. After your account is connected go to accounts&gt;your SILC account you just made&gt;create silc key pair...then change the host name, real name, and email to something of your choosing to keep yourself anonymous. <br /><br />Make sure you use the same pass as you did when you created account if you choose to remember password, otherwise you wont be able to connect. If you do not scroll down when performing this step to fill in the passphrase boxes, your password will be blank and will not match the password for log on credentials thus making it impossible to load the key pair!<br /><br />Click generate key pair, Set user info and then disable and re-enable the account. Every time you try to create a key pair it&#039;ll put your hostname in the account so be careful when generating key pairs. Make sure to go to accounts&gt;set user info every time you generate a new key pair!<br /><br />You may want to disable chat logging in pidgin if you do not have an encrypted partition or properly secured computer. To do this simply go to Tools&gt;Preferences&gt;Logging and un-check the boxes.<br /><br />step 8: Join the chat! The chat name is silkroad. To join select buddies&gt;join a chat&gt;SILC account and put silkroad as channel name. Press join and that&#039;s all she wrote! Look forward to seeing some new faces in the chat. Sorry if this tutorial is a bit rocky, making tutorials isn&#039;t really my thing...;)<br /><br />****Some pointers for our friends who cannot seem to join the chat*****<br />1 )Make sure the password you set in step 7 matches your password in your log in information.<br />2) Try deleting the account and trying again.<br />3) Find the .silc folder for Pidgin, which is usually in AppData under roaming. AppData is normally a hidden folder, which contained in your user folder so you may have to set windows to show hidden folders.<br />4) Try reinstalling pidgin.<br /><br />**********MAC INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN BY NIMBUS.

				sometime this afternoon the chat room started dwindling down, seemed that the people that were there were still there but no one could re enter the chat room. i saw it get down to 7 people during peek hours before i eventually had to power down my machine and then of course later I could not get on either. I am certain there are a few people left in there right now but no one is able to connect and enter now. seems weird

				Hi, guys. I&#039;ve been trying to get through on my Mac for two days (you gotta update that wiki to tell people not to bother with SILC) and the closest I&#039;ve gotten is with Adium. But then I keep getting refused. Let&#039;s see, encryption....check. Soxks5 proxy, check. Weird distorted address, check. I get through well on IRC Freenet, and plain old EFnet fine. Anything I&#039;m leaving out?

				for anyone who would like to use a different client than pidgin, for accessing the chat on IRC, KVirc is a client that is portable and can be run off a USB stick&nbsp; http://www.kvirc.net/ <br /><br />it has a windows, osx, linux and freebsd versions as well.&nbsp; i havent had a chance to play around with it yet, but i&#039;ll try some stuff in it at some point today to see how it is to setup through TOR

				I accidentally connected my IRC client to port 9050 and noticed my connection was accepted (and then closed almost immediately). This is of course not necessarily a security hole, but it&#039;s a very basic thing to lock down unused ports on any server exposed to unknown parties. Makes me wonder what other things are not up to standards.<br /><br />Sorry if it&#039;s intentionally open :). Don&#039;t mean to rant.<br /><br />edit: I mean port 9050 on the IRC server (silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion).

Whether it works or not is up to you<br />to test. http://addons.miranda-im.org/details.php?action=viewfile&amp;id=2644<br /><br />Use it if you want to PM people over the server. If it doesn&#039;t work, being that you use windows - <br />you may be prudent to install pidgin somewhere secure and keep that as your silcroad chat client.<br />http://www.pidgin.im/<br />http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/<br /><br />(Anyone else reading this, big update to OTR on 4th/sep)<br /><br />Hope that sort of helps.

				That hostname is set locally on your client. disconnect and dig through the settings. Every client is different.<br /><br /><br />it is asking for a pass because whatever the username you are using is taken<br /><br /><br />once you change your hostname issue and are connected you can type in any connected window:<br /><br />/nick mynewnickname<br /><br />then<br /><br />/join #public<br /><br />and you will join the chat where most people are.<br />

				Can someone hold my hand and walk me through setting up mIRC for this? In particular I&#039;m worried about the &quot;Local&quot; page of mIRC&#039;s options. I have no idea what any of those settings do and I&#039;m worried I&#039;ll accidentally reveal my IP.<br /><br />Also, from the IRC Anonymity Guide (http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/IRC_Anonymity_Guide):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">mIRC supports three types of proxies: SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and &quot;PROXY&quot; (HTTP CONNECT). SOCKS4 does not support proxy-based DNS resolution. SOCKS5 does, but mIRC attempts to resolve hostnames first directly, and then only through your SOCKS5 proxy if direct resolution fails. This means you will leak all DNS requests through mIRC if using either SOCKS4 or SOCKS5. Therefore, Tor users of mIRC are advised to use only the &quot;PROXY&quot; method and then point mIRC at an HTTP CONNECT -&gt; SOCKS middleman such as Privoxy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is that necessary? I don&#039;t want to be asking my ISP to resolve silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion every now and again for obvious reasons but running Privoxy seems like a pain in the arse when I have a Tor Browser Bundle based setup just now. <br /><br />Halp.<br /><br />(PS I&#039;m open to using another client if it&#039;s easier to harden than mIRC and runs on Windows)

				Depends on the program, and I have virtually no experience with mIRC.&nbsp; I use XChat; for that, in the list of networks, just add a new one.&nbsp; Then after creating an entry for &quot;silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion/6667&quot;, in the settings for that network just put in the proxy info. And make very sure &quot;bypass proxy&quot; is NOT checked, and &quot;use global credentials&quot; is NOT checked. You want a unique handle for the chat so it&#039;s more anonymous, and using the same one as you globally use less than unique.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s the same in mIRC, but I can&#039;t tell you where to go or anything -- hopefully somebody else&#039;ll help you out there. Good luck.

				Ummm... I didn&#039;t follow that all, to be honest, bro, but... no, don&#039;t do anything that says it could reveal your IP.&nbsp; If it&#039;s downloading Pidgin that you&#039;re talking about, you probably already have the program.&nbsp; It comes with most Linux distros I think.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in Windows, yeah, download it.&nbsp; Just download it through your regular browser though.&nbsp; It&#039;s a popular IM client, no worries -- don&#039;t expose your Tor identity needlessly, it&#039;s safer to d/l Pidgin the normal way (but I still don&#039;t know what that warning is from?)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what else you might mean... or what the OP has for the server info, but it&#039;s &quot;silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion&quot; on port 6667.

				Hey kitkat,<br /><br />That&#039;s one error i&#039;ve never heard mentioned, ever :O - It sounds like you have a funky setup i&#039;m not aware of, I can&#039;t see why you&#039;d be banned from a tor relay. If you didn&#039;t get that message from the debug, (that is if you&#039;re using pidgin,) turn the debug window on in the help menu. Hopefully that&#039;ll give you more info on your proxy setting and where and when it&#039;s failing to even attempt to connect to the .onion - I&#039;ll ask around and see if anyone ever had that error.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t using pidgin, you might find your client hates SOCKS, if it&#039;s Adium, i&#039;m sure a mac guy will drop by soon.

				Due to a change in the law which outlawed isobutyl nitrite in 2007, poppers on sale in the UK are now made with isopropyl nitrite. Theres alot&nbsp; of people desperate to get there hands on old style poppers , and alot of websites selling rubbish quality stuff, theres definitely money to be made by someone depending where in the world you live (i think Canada America and Australia are some of the countrys where its legal to buy) and its not that hard to do either, as soon as word gets out were to go you will probably struggle to keep up with demand so someone try and see what happens.

Just make sure they use SOCKS5 and don&#039;t pull .onion DNS requests (FUCK YOU mIRC)<br /><br />Also, torchat is a completely different protocol and nothing to do with the chatroom - useful program though, and the portable is in the torchat/bin directory. Don&#039;t forget to save your user/friend&#039;s keys if you intend on moving it around. Hope that helps.<br /><br />Happy new year guys!

				So that means Time Till Live expired.&nbsp; When a packet gets sent to the network, every time a computer picks it up and then re-transmits it because it isn&#039;t the recipient (that&#039;s how the internet works, believe it or not -- packets just get passed back and forth all day long until they hit the recipient), 1 gets subtracted from the packet&#039;s Time Till Live number.&nbsp; If that hits 0, no computers re-send it, they just drop it where it is and notify the sender.<br /><br />So basically, your connection got passed around for so long, it reached the limit your computer set for it and died.&nbsp; Keep trying, if that&#039;s the only problem you&#039;re having then you&#039;ll get it as soon as you have a Tor circuit to the server.<br />

				Lol TrashBox, if I saw your q. earlier I would have responded staright away. Not sure I agree with you on the “cool chat room” bit (LMAO) but still…. (Oh, nomad rocks by the way, coolest guy there)<br /><br />Can you give us some information on where you’re finding this “Unable to connect: TTL expired”<br /><br />When I first joined I had a bit of trouble, there were boxes popping ↑ left, right and centre, could be streamlined a bit. Some boxes don’t even need to be there.<br /><br />You read the OP correct? How far did you get?<br /><br />If anyone else from this chat room reads this can you please answer her in meantime b/c I am off and on for the next week; can’t be here constantaly. <br /><br />I’m here now though, so TrashBox how far did you get with it before that message? Also, I’ve read a couple of your recent posts, are you on molly right now? Also, if you’re busy just do this later. Yar, I kind of relaise you’re a vendor, so any time is fine, don’t sweat it. First time I set it up it took m a while, crazy lol. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />.......Lol @ Trash❏...molly inspired posts…. lulz…. :) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Take care. Raz.<br /><br />(Sweet of you to say what you did on kitkat thread, really resonated with me a lot b/c it is an important topic that never gets talked about, and when it does, always attracts nasty comments from people, can’t F1 themselves. I’m sure all of your posts made a difference. No one should be in that postiotn.)<br /><br />(btw, if you can’t find me at any stage and want me quick just email me (godannif@tormail.org), but always use TorMail to TorMail, never from here. I will get it quicker.)<br /><br />Lol, I downloaded new Tor SEC update, but it won’t even load, it’s that slow. So I STILL have to put up with increasingly slow-loading pages. Lol, I can’t win. Need to delete it, then download it from scratch. Ugh. <br /><br />[Edit. Yeah okay, NOW I see you are responded to lol. GL getting on. Follow SS&#039;s advice, as it is confusing if you have two people trying to help you, but I&#039;ll be here anyway for a bit (5 mins)]

				Oh, I&#039;m sorry -- is your problem not solved?&nbsp; That&#039;s really weird... are you sure you&#039;re using the right port and server name, and that it&#039;s set to connect through a proxy on that account?<br /><br />Oh, do the instructions say to make sure that Tor is set to use a specific port, or did you not do anything about that?&nbsp; ... no, that wouldn&#039;t give you a TTL timeout though, that can&#039;t be the problem... hrm.<br />

				In Windows, nothing it turns out.&nbsp; In Linux, nothing if it works.&nbsp; If it still isn&#039;t working, put those two lines in that file and restart Tor.<br /><br />It makes the program listen on an additional port for local programs only (nothing external from anyone else, just you and your computer).&nbsp; That way Pidgin can connect to it.&nbsp; If pidgin is set to connect to port 9050, but Tor isn&#039;t listening on port 9050, it ain&#039;t gonna work too well.<br /><br />Again, in Windows, it already is listneing on 9050.&nbsp; It&#039;s only in Linux that it wouldn&#039;t be.<br />

				Just follow my directions:<br />Step 1: Go to your Vidalia settings&gt;Advanced&gt;Then uncheck the box next to Configure ControlPort automatically<br />Step 2: Open IRC client (I used XChat).<br />Step 3: In the Network List, click &quot;Add&quot; and name the new network SILC.<br />Step 4: Make sure that network is highlighted and click &quot;Edit...&quot;<br />Step 5: At the top, make sure that you clear all the servers in the list, if any. Then click &quot;Add&quot; and enter silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion/6667<br />Step 6: Check Connect to selected server only<br />Step 7: Uncheck Use global user information<br />Step 8: Enter nickname stuff. Here is an example:<br />Nick name: zipstyle<br />Second choice: zipstyle_<br />Username: zipstyle<br />Real Name: (FUCKDAPOLICE)<br />Step 9: Click Close<br />Step 10: In XChat, go to Settings&gt;Preferences&gt;Network Setup<br />Step 11: Under the section that says Proxy Server, enter 127.0.0.1 for Hostname<br />Step 12: Enter 9050 for the Port.<br />Step 13: Make sure the Type is SOCKS5<br />Step 14: Don&#039;t do anything else in this box. Click Ok.<br />Step 15: Make sure you have the SILC network selected and click Connect.<br /><br />You should, at this point, be online with no problems!<br />Let me know if you have any other problems/questions :)

				Trashbox,<br /><br />I havent had time to read all the posts, but if you are on linux (not sure what you&#039;re on) it helps to have tor installed (not tor browser bundle). If you are on linux open a terminal ( ctrl + alt + t) then type:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">sudo apt-get install tor</code><br />And then hit enter. it may ask for a password. <br />after that installs try connecting to pidgin again<br /><br />I hope this is the case.

				Yeah, everybody&#039;s right: if you&#039;re having trouble, you just need to change your proxy settings to use address 127.0.0.1 and port 9150.<br /><br />Previously Tor would end up listening on a randomly chosen port in Linux, and would always listen on 9050 in Windows.&nbsp; Now it listens on 9150 in both Linux and Windows, and the control port for Vidalia is 9151.&nbsp; I have no fucking clue why they decided to randomly screw us all up, but at least it&#039;s not different across platforms anymore... which is good I guess.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure they had a reason for not just sticking with 9050.&nbsp; Not too sure it&#039;s really a good one, but I&#039;m sure they have it all the same.<br />

				UPDATE for those that are not Super Tech-Savvy:<br />aka The Baby Step Guide for the Stoned, Lazy and Tired:<br /><br />Step 1: Go to your Vidalia settings&gt;Advanced&gt;Then uncheck the box next to Configure ControlPort automatically<br />Step 2: Open IRC client (I used XChat).<br />Step 3: In the Network List, click &quot;Add&quot; and name the new network SILC.<br />Step 4: Make sure that network is highlighted and click &quot;Edit...&quot;<br />Step 5: At the top, make sure that you clear all the servers in the list, if any. Then click &quot;Add&quot; and enter silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion/6667<br />Step 6: Check Connect to selected server only<br />Step 7: Uncheck Use global user information<br />Step 8: Enter nickname stuff. Here is an example:<br />Nick name: zipstyle<br />Second choice: zipstyle_<br />Username: zipstyle<br />Real Name: (FUCKDAPOLICE)<br />Step 9: Click Close<br />Step 10: In XChat, go to Settings&gt;Preferences&gt;Network Setup<br />Step 11: Under the section that says Proxy Server, enter 127.0.0.1 for Hostname<br />Step 12: Enter 9150 for the Port.<br />Step 13: Make sure the Type is SOCKS5<br />Step 14: Don&#039;t do anything else in this box. Click Ok.<br />Step 15: Make sure you have the SILC network selected and click Connect.<br /><br />You should, at this point, be online with no problems!<br />Let me know if you have any other problems/questions :)

				That&#039;s odd.&nbsp; Did you set your IRC client to connect to the control port or something?&nbsp; If you want an easy way to tell what port to use, just go into your Tor browser settings and check what it&#039;s using (since that&#039;s obviously working): Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced, click on Networking tab, click the button at the top in the Connection frame.&nbsp; Put whatever port is in there into your IRC client.

				When you send a packet, it gets stamped with the number 127, and each router that it passes through decreases it by one.

It can usually be passed off<br />as condom or birth control patch (for the ladies).<br /><br />Due to the packaging, the lack of design, and<br />the larger perforated hits we find this is excellent<br />and uber-stealthy.<br />In this packaging it can be submerged, heated<br />(well unless you ignite the mylar :D ) buried in the<br />dirt outside or duct-taped to things like girders,<br />beams, undersides of cars and inside AC venting. &quot;<br /><br />Such a shame when people rush to judgment in the absence of investigating the plain and simple facts.<br /><br />

Newish thread though:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172247.0<br /><br />Gimme a shout if you can&#039;t connect. It&#039;s still the same address and proxy port 9050/9150 depending on tor version, or &quot;Use gnome settings&quot; If on tails or whonix.<br />Also try a few times if you get TTL or refused errors, what with this tor malarkey :)<br />

I spent most of the summer up in mountains, with my dogs and goats. now, weather getting cold up there, so I down to valley. My valley looks so deserted, where all those people gone, I have no idea. Because of flooding in Uttarkhand with huge TV coverage, our tourism business been totally devastated this year. Even, we do not have experienced any flooding.<br /><br />Oh ... thanks, now cheers working for me... so cheers !!
