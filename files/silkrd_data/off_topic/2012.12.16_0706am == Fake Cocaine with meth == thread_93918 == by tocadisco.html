				As a long time cocaine user, nothing pisses me off more than getting coke that&#039;s cut with cheap stims. Nothing pisses me off more than laying down to sleep only to find that I can&#039;t sleep and my heart is racing for the next 8 hours.<br /><br />I would rather get heavily cut down coke with inert substances than coke cut with that shit.

If your customers wanted lidocaine and meth they would have asked for lidocaine and meth, and probably would have gotten it for much cheaper as well.

				Cutting with inactive substances is one thing, putting something like meth in your coke is another altogether. I am a chronic insomniac who has received methy coke a few times (dealers admitted it to me after I confronted them about it). It was AWFUL - I was up for a full day afterwards and had a brutal comedown. Please don&#039;t ever do this, meth is rougher on the body than coke and your customers have the right to know what substances they are really taking.
