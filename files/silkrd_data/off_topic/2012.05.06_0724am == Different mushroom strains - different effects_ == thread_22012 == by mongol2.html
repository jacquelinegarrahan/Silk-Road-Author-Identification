				I only tripped on mushrooms twice. The first time i didn&#039;t know what the strain was and I don&#039;t know what dose I took. There was minor body load, very clear mind, mild hallucinations, strong euphoria. I would say I felt more adequate than I do in my normal state.<br /><br />The second time, after a few months, I took around 1.5g of cubes, and it was like a totally different substance. Very dreamy &amp; foggy, really strong body load and nothing really euphoric. It felt much dirtier and not so much pleasant.<br /><br />Now I know that every trip is different even when you have the same substance, but it clearly felt like it was also because I had different type of shrooms.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve had experience with different mushroom strains, please share. :) I&#039;m interested what mushrooms give that clear sober-like trip.

				Sounds to me that you took low dosages,both times.Of course, different strains of shrooms and even the same strains will offer you a different kind of trip each time!They have their own consciousness or personality it seems.Cubensis IMO,is a low potency shroom..depending on the strain and the dosage.But you can have&nbsp; very nice &amp; profound experiences...on cubensis itself,if you are willing to go higher on your dosage..my personal fav..is....Psilocybe cyanescens!1g..and your good to go...&quot;sober like trips&quot;IMO,is having a low dosage.If your looking for a real trip on shrooms..no matter the variety,go higher on your dosage...obviously 2 of your trips werent enough!My humble advice,try to increase to about 3 to 5 g! :- ) <br /><br />hope this helps!<br />STAY SAFE!<br />BP!!

				As far as I know psilocin is the only psychoactive chemical in magic mushrooms (psilocybin is metabolized into psilocin). I suppose there could be other psychoactive chemicals in magic mashrooms that haven&#039;t been discovered yet, but I think the most likely explanation is that you are attributing differences in trips to the strain when in fact each trip just happens to be different.

Even in a single batch of shrooms, they won&#039;t all have the same concentration of psilocin /psliocybin in them. <br /><br />There are also several other minor alkaloids present in the shrooms. From trip reports and personal experience, I&#039;ve always found shroom trips to be different from tripping on pure psilocin, so it&#039;s possible (but by no means established) that some or all of these other alkaloids also play a role, which would bring even more variability. <br /><br />But even if each species were shown to cause a slightly different trip, that difference is certain to be smaller than the individual variability inherent to the psychedelic trip, and therefore to be negligible.

				Set and setting. This is the mantra for all psychedelic drugs.<br /><br />You can have two ENTIRELY different experiences depending on how you feel at the moment you take them and who you are with. This includes the intensity and effects of your trip.<br /><br />As someone who has slight experience growing, I can attest that strains of cubes have minimal differences in the end product outside of the aesthetic. Some strains have different colonization and fruiting times but the end product is essentially identical for all intents and purposes. Strains are largely the same in potency across the board. This is not just my opinion but the opinions of people who are far more experienced in growing than myself who I&#039;ve had the pleasure of talking to on other message boards. I honestly don&#039;t think that the differences in your trips were due to a variation in dose but instead how you felt going into the respective trips.<br /><br />Different species of mushroom though, that&#039;s a totally different story. Azures and cyans have different concentrations of psychoactive chemicals than cubes.
