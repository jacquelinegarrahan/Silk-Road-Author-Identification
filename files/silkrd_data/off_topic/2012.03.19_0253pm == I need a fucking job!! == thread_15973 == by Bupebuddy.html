				You know the saying you gotta have money to make money? Its very true. Guessing that you havent ranted about this website to any of your friends or anyone close to you, you could let them know you have a way of getting some rare drugs in your area then simply become the only plug for it in your area of Canada. This is a market after all..<br /><br />-dr34d<br /><br />

				I really like your idea dreadlock but I just don&#039;t think I would be able to do that.&nbsp; I just do not know of many people at all who are users.&nbsp; Sure I know some dealers but they are the special blend that sell one thing and one thing only.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like I&#039;m fresh out of high school or college I have been around for a little while so the people I know are more of the business type who may ocassionaly use coke or smoke a jib but that is even more rare.&nbsp; Besides I don&#039;t have the capital to order enough product to begin selling anything worthwile.

				Have you thought about moving to an area where there are jobs available?&nbsp; There are always jobs.&nbsp; Just not where we always like them to be or the type of jobs that we like.&nbsp; But, if your at the point where you have no choice, pack up and leave and take any job you can find.&nbsp; If your a hard worker you&#039;ll get back on your feet.&nbsp; Just might take some time.

				I have been in your shoes not too long ago. I looked for more than a year, luckily I had unemployment for almost the entire time and I got the maximum that they give for unemployment, wasn&#039;t a ton, but it paid the bills, I went from interview to interview and got more discouraged as time went by.. Luckily I got a position with my dads company, the pay is for shit, but at least i can pay my bills. <br /><br />Just keep on looking and something will eventually happen. Dont be prideful. Take any job. Mcdonalds, burgerking, whatever, at least you will have some income. Also, apply&nbsp; for food stamps and see if there are any grants or help that the government has. There are tons of programs that are out there that most people dont realize... <br /><br />Good luck, i know exactly how you feel..

				www.Odesk.com<br /><br />Freelancing site. I typically use it to hire people from east asia to do low-level research for me (I don&#039;t have to pay them that much and the money is worth many times more to them), but if you speak english well and have any computer skills you can make a &#039;contractor&#039; account and hire yourself out.

I was in the &#039;ogmz there are no jobs&#039; camp.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t put in one application in this time period.&nbsp; The minute my unemployment got taken away, I went and put in over 100 jab apps within a week or so.&nbsp; Within another week I had an interview, within another a job offer with the contingency of a passed piss test, 4 days later I had a job.<br /><br />It&#039;s not hard, I guarantee you if you spend half the time you did online out looking for a job you&#039;d have one in less than a month.<br />Some people don&#039;t realize that just putting in an application isn&#039;t going to cut it. Here are a few pro tips: <br />-Hand your application to the manager directly, they will usually look over it on the spot and may even offer an interview.&nbsp; You never know what the employee may do with your application/where it may end up if you do not approach it this way.<br />-Call them back after they have had your application for 5 days.&nbsp; This is plenty of time for them to review your application/check references, and by this time they already have a good idea of if they want to hire you or not.&nbsp; Ask to speak to the hiring manager, not just any manager, this is the one that will get you what you want.&nbsp; Calling them shows them you really want the job, it seperates your application from the other 400 on their desk.<br />-IF you get the interview, dress appropriately for the position which you are interviewing.&nbsp; Review some interview questions online and be ready for the standard ones, know your answers before they ask them.&nbsp; I could get a job in my sleep, I am great at interviews, this is because i know the questions they are going to ask and I have a real world work experience example ready to go to support my answer. (This is important, they want to know that you have been able to implement the thigs they are looking for in the past successfully.)&nbsp; *If you don&#039;t have an example for them, this is where some great bullshitting comes into play, talk them into believing you have great work ethic, etc.&nbsp; Without over doing it of course ;)<br /><br />You should be able to land a job quite easily if you implement some of your own time along with some of these tips.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />toker

				We need English teachers in South America, pay is probably less in dollar terms than you&#039;re used to but it will pay a decent lifestyle because of our low cost of living.&nbsp; If you can get yourself to anywhere in central or south america, be sober for your job interview and talk proper, understandable english then you have a guaranteed job.&nbsp; Probably not the advice you&#039;re looking for since you say you&#039;ve got a mortgage but if you&#039;re going to get evicted soon it might be an option.&nbsp; You can usually get a job on a tourist visa without many problems and either travel around or work out how to get residency, making friends with an priest and offering to do a couple of hours volunteering usually sorts that problem...<br /><br />Again, we really need native English speakers down here, the requirements are that you can speak clearly some proper English and are willing to learn about your language yourself, be present in the country and that is basically it.&nbsp; Oh and be a bit presentable, nose rings and visible tattoos are not going to help anywhere.<br /><br />If you really really need high end drugs then don&#039;t consider it though, we&#039;ve only got dirt weed, great cocaine and a few natural psychedelics.<br /><br />Colombia is desperate right now, pay is very high, Uruguay has decriminalized weed if your afraid of our corrupt cops but it is very expensive to live there and pay is not commensurate, ALBA countries have lower costs of living for normal people.&nbsp; Most everywhere in the rest of America apart from the US is low tax, low cost, low law enforcement and high potential for English speaking Gringos.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hijos de puta, vienen aca y roban nuestro trabajo!

				Shift your paradigm my friend. Take a job (or even volunteer work!) that gets you out meeting people you can talk to... about getting a job. Then, make the effort. Chat up everyone you interact with. Brighten their day. Make a connection. Then, and only then, see if they have any leads for you.<br /><br />In a crap economy like this cold calling is death unless you have serious skillz in that regard. Even then, cold calling is death unless you are face to face with the person with the authority to actually hire you. Over the years I have gotten my ass hired for dozens of jobs that I wasn&#039;t really qualified for. But those pesky HR people refuse to be charmed and insist on reading my non-applicable résumé. <br /><br />The way to get hired is by knowing somebody. Even if you have only known them for the 10 minutes that you helped them find stuff at HomeDepo.&nbsp; So get a job that gives you the right amount of face time. Working in the back of a warehouse gets you nowhere. But working fast food doesn&#039;t get you very far either; the contact is to brief.<br /><br />

One where the parts of the job that scare off other people are a bonus to you. I had a limo gig in Chicago that was a dream job for me, but would have sucked for most.

				Well, fact of the matter is there&#039;s always got to be a job somewhere in the area, although relocating would be nice. Although the economy is the lack of employment takes up most of it, I&#039;d probably have a easier time finding one if I had my shit together and wasn&#039;t afraid of the drug test lol.

				Yeah drug testing doesn&#039;t happen for jobs outside the US.. Most parts of the world we have these funny things called rights... And if you don&#039;t have your shit together, ie qualifications, seriously thing about somewhere a bit underdeveloped where english isn&#039;t the first language, you&#039;ll get good employment to share your brilliant language skills, you could even do an online tefl course in a couple of weeks and make yourself super recruitable, english teachers get paid anywhere from minimum wage up to 5x minimum with no qualifications and no pay, drunks turn up on holiday looking for extra cash and get gainful employment, you could be much better than them.

				Oh boo hoo, no job, tear tear!! Sob, whoa is me! ....Suck it up man, no one wants a whiner!<br /><br />No, i&#039;m not really this insensitive. But I was in your position few months ago, workin in crappy restaurant, worried about bills and rent, etc. I had college degree too, but no one was callin me back for interviews. Then finally I said fuck it, I&#039;m not sending out any more resumes/cover letters period! I hate cover letters with a passion: they take time to customize to each job, they suck the soul from my body, no one reads them, yet everyone requires them! Wtf!?<br /><br />But that decision was the best in my life. I&#039;ve since become my own boss, and love every minute of it! I don&#039;t wanna go in detail, but SR was tantamount to it, it inspired me in more ways than I can express. My friend, don&#039;t be beside yourself, take this bad patch as opportunity! Companies suck anyway, you will forever work under a boss that hates you anyway, and you can never be yourself. You will forever run your life always thinking about how any choice will affect your job and your &quot;reputation.&quot; Being entrepreneur frees you. :)<br /><br />An idea I had (but doubt I&#039;ll do) is go to friends/family/etc. and see if they have any bills, penalties, tickets and see if you can lower them. Don&#039;t charge them money unless you&#039;re successful, then take a cut of it as payment. You&#039;ll be surprised how many people receive penalties, etc. yet just pay them because fighting is too hard. Yet with not much work, you can get them reduced by just asking. It never hurts in life to just ask, worst they say is no!<br /><br />Example: Old man I know is payin down $20k in debt, but is better off than ur situation. He has voice/internet from phone co., cable from cable co. I got him new cable/internet service from cable provider, then cancelled voice, so he just uses cell phone now. He went from $240/mo to now $110/mo, and much faster internet speeds too (he had DSL before lol). He never did this himself cuz he thought it wouldn&#039;t work, wasn&#039;t possible. Negativity is a bitch, I swear.<br /><br />Also, you can try growing marijuana in your house. Buy some seeds from here (VarietyJones?) or dispensary and grow them using LED lighting (so to reduce power bills). Be careful to keep them indoors, and control who visits your house. Find friend in NE USA, Richmond, VA on north to Maine because weed is worth much more there. Also, not sure if you&#039;re in USA, but know your rights: You can always decline a search from police unless they have a warrant; they can pat you down for weapons though (airports/borders are exception). Even if they search anyway, your lawyer can bat down charges. <br /><br />Basically, best way to think of it is find something you do daily/weekly, something you can talk about with someone for decent amount of time and you never get sick of it. Something you can bullshit being expert on :) Then make that into your career! That was Steve Jobs&#039; advice to world, you should listen ;) <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />P.S. Don&#039;t write off unemployment that quick, you can use it to fund your new venture. Plus, just cuz they say it&#039;s &quot;illegal&quot; to work while collecting and not report it fully, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ll find out. They know only as much as their amount of auditing staff let them. Lot of counties, states, etc. have none, or very little. :) But, um, you didn&#039;t hear that from me. lol

				P.P.S. In reference to friend in Northeast USA, I forgot to say to mail your weed to that friend for profit. Or you can buy SR vendor account and sell here. <br /><br />Also, another penalty you can help people with are bank overdraft fees. You don&#039;t know how many overdraft fees I&#039;ve gotten reversed per year just by sheer persistence and annoyance -- over 20! They always say this&#039;ll be the last one, it&#039;s only as courtesy this one time -- horseshit, they LIIIEE! Call regular cust service, if they dont&#039; budge, search online for the bank&#039;s &quot;executive customer service&quot; phone number, they all have them. These are special numbers for their high rollers. They are easier to get successful refunds.<br /><br />Fuck the banks! haha

				Dude, don&#039;t look for jobs on the net that doesn&#039;t work 99.9% of the time, too many people applying for the same gig.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked at a recruitment agency so I know how all that works.<br /><br />My advice : Physically go to local businesses, dress smart, act the part, and just nicely ask if they have any openings and bring along a resume, explain you&#039;re willing to work any kind of position they might have and be willing to settle for minimum wage or tips (if it&#039;s a waiter job or something).&nbsp; Also, if you know anyone who owns a business, don&#039;t be ashamed to ask for help and offer your services to them, but be cool about it don&#039;t come off too desperate like it&#039;s your last resort.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get any kind of job, maybe you&#039;re setting your sights too high or you live in a really bad place like Detroit?&nbsp; Try applying in person at restaurants, cafes, delis, small shops, whatever, but just be cordial and even if they reject you walk out with your head held high, nothing bad can come of it.&nbsp; You should never in life fear rejection, or you are holding yourself back from all kinds of wonderful opportunities.&nbsp; Any kind of job is better than none at all, so you should offer yourself to work minimum wage jobs, ie. cleaning toilets at a gas station, if you need to if you REALLY want to work and not just ask for handouts.&nbsp; The part about your post that indicates you&#039;re not trying as hard as you could is where you shamelessly ask for donations.&nbsp; This makes me think you&#039;re the sort who considers himself above &quot;dirty work&quot;.<br /><br />From my time working at the employment agency, I dealt with SO MANY people who had this attitude, wah wah wah I can&#039;t get any jobs, who had gone to college and consequently felt entitled, like they were too good to work at McDonalds.&nbsp; Whenever I would suggest them realistic job opportunities they could attain, the economy being the way it is, they&#039;d act disinterested and usually never come back and I&#039;m sure they just went right back home and never applied for the positions I recommended to them.<br /><br />There are usually jobs out there somewhere, especially if you live in a major city or town, they might not be good jobs or pleasant ones, but jobs nonetheless.&nbsp; Again, apply physically in person when possible or call them up, and always be professional and friendly even if they are total dicks to you in the way they reject you.&nbsp; I myself never went to college/university, but nowadays am successfully working for a large firm, with a stable position and a good salary.&nbsp; I attribute my success to the fact that I&#039;ve always been a hard worker and go-getter, and I always treat people with respect even when they might not reciprocate.<br /><br />Btw, benzos are sometimes great to take before stressful job interviews, at low doses of course ;) they help you appear less nervous/fidgety in your body language as well as speech and from my experiences they&#039;ve on many occasions helped me establish a rapport with interviewers more effectively since whilst on them I&#039;m able to communicate a bit more clearly without nerves holding me back from saying what I need to say.<br /><br />If I can impress tough business people in stressful interview/grilling type situations with my lack of a college degree but hard work ethic and positive, confident demeanor, it shouldn&#039;t be too hard for you to some day make something of yourself.&nbsp; Consider yourself lucky you were able to go to college, but don&#039;t think you&#039;re superior to others just because you did and go out there willing to mop some floors if need be.&nbsp; You can always apply for more jobs while doing that, then it also shows you&#039;re a hard worker unlike many of your fellow college grads.&nbsp; Let&#039;s face it, a lot of people just party in college and it&#039;s kind of a joke for many, but the physical degree itself is the valuable part as well as connections and friends you make whilst studying there.

				The TEFL route is certainly a good way for native English speakers to earn some money. You should bear in mind that online qualifications will naturally not be as prestigious as CELTA or TESOL certified courses which take place over several weeks and give you practical classroom experience, although admittedly these are more expensive.<br /><br />I hope since you made this post the situation has improved. If not, I would suggest keeping on doing as others suggested by physically handing in copies of your CV at restaurants and cafes. When I was unemployed a couple of years ago I quite literally walked into several jobs as a porter (or &#039;bellhop&#039; if you&#039;re American) in hotels. They employ seasonal staff and there is quite a high turnover so I think your chances would be good.<br /><br />In the short term there are websites which will pay you a couple of dollars to write a few words. Perhaps the easiest one to get into would be Amazon&#039;s Mechanical Turk which pays anything from one cent to several dollars to people to do tasks that machines can&#039;t such as associating keywords with images, transcribing sound files, writing articles. I used to do this but like others on here have found more profitable ways to pass the time!<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve scraped together a few dollars I&#039;d strongly recommend getting yourself a cheap phone, perhaps with Android OS like the Samsung Galaxy mini? That combined with a Pay as you Go chip will give you internet access and allow you to edit and send your CV off to prospective employers. There&#039;s also an app (Orbot) which will keep you in touch with your buddies on SR!<br /><br />If you&#039;re not comfortable dealing drugs I would suggest seeing if you can beg borrow or steal the money necessary to buy some &quot;hot&quot; goods from SR or the Black Market and sell them for a modest profit on Craigslist. Perhaps see if any of the buyers on here would also be interested in using your address as a &quot;dead drop&quot; in exchange for a modest fee too?<br /><br />I have been where you&#039;ve been buddy and hear you - the only way from here is up! Look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />
