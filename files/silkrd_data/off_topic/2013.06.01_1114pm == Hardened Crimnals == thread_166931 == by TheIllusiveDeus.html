				Every time I surf through these forums I giggle a little bit at the irony of life. 95% of all people think that we are hardened criminals, using what ever we can to get drugs. The general population would speak out against us buying acid and heroin, because it &quot;ruins peoples lives&quot;. But every time I go through these forums I just see the nicest people saying the nicest things to each other. Everyone is trying to help everyone else out and its just kinda beautiful. Nobody cares if your 90 or even if you 16, nobody cares that you are black or white, nobody cares that you do drugs, nobody cares... and its kinda fuckin nice. I love how this site is just a big fuck you to the government, it just screams I can live my own life and I can do what I want.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been around for a little while (just made my second order) but i&#039;m in love with this place. Thank you guys so much for going through all these hoops to make me a happier person. stay safe and if anyone needs help with anything PM me and I&#039;ll help you to my fullest extent.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D :D :D

It felt like living in an old movie<br /><br />Society makes &quot;hardened criminals&quot;. I&#039;ll be honest, I used to think every guy who did heroin was a lost cunt, beyond help and just ruined their lives. Then I came here and saw reviews for proper clean heroin from regular users and they seem no different to you and I.<br /><br />Fucking guberment cuts shit up, supplies drugs, makes it about the money, breeds criminals but then conveniently shifts the blame and no one asks questions.<br /><br />Australia has an &quot;ice epidemic&quot; you should see the ads they put out for Ice.

If drugs were legal, they wouldn&#039;t have to be associated with &quot;real&quot; crime like street violence, theft, and other unpleasantness. These things actually affect others&#039; lives; an individual responsibly enjoying some mind-altering substances does not.

				Being the boss or high up in a drug syndicate does makes you a dangerous person but to be a truly hard criminal you need to do your own dirty work. Far too much risk to have someone else know your secrets, what you have ordered people do, who you are, etc. For self preservation and longevity in the criminal world you will need to take it upon yourself to &quot;fix&quot; problems without another soul ever knowing you are connected. It can be quite easy if the problem is a junky, especially if they are a full junky who will inject drugs they found in their driveway in a bag on the floor. Or if you only want to talk to someone (in a firearm controlled country) who is screening calls and owes money etc what you do i wait until night time, turn of the power to the house in the meter box and wait. They will always come out, sometimes strait away, sometimes 15 minutes, but you will get to talk to them. <br /><br />Thankfully most true hardened criminals are inconspicuous, hold regular jobs and blend in with normal society. Most would never know they passed an old school killer in the shopping center the other day as he purchased his bread and milk. Only those that have been there will notice small &quot;tells&quot; like the faded swallow tattoo, worn out knuckles, or the constant heightened situational awareness.

				I can&#039;t respond that post by PrincessHIGH b/c according to astor that is &quot;cheerleading&quot;, as opposed to having a debate, but, on Silk Road forums astor there is a button called &quot;Quote&quot; that you can click to respond to someone. On this forum, if someone uses that function, they usually refer to what the other person quoted. This is called &quot;responding&quot;, not &quot;cheerleading&quot;. <br /><br />This has been a Raz tutorial for SMF forums. I hope you will always come to me with your future FAQ questions. Are we done here? I don&#039;t need your permission to quote and respond astor.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

If you don&#039;t want a trash-talking session then don&#039;t start one. Also I see it took you 5 hours to come up with a response to this, weird how some people are too scared to respond until the other person is safely offline. <br /><br />You&#039;ve lost a chunk of your former good reputation astor in the last month or so to when you first came here. People used to respect you on this forum, and when I say that, EVERYBODY, including people who matter, now you have turned into making snide, derogatory comments and subtly trolling people. Shame to see you turn. Not sure what point you are&nbsp; trying to prove, or why&nbsp; you have followed us around on multiple threads -- this is the third time you&#039;ve posted after us to leave a smart aleck and derogatory remark -- but you need to get a life and find your own topics to post about. It is not up to you to follow people around trying to figure out who is responding to who -- what business is it of yours to tell me who I can and can&#039;t talk to? You obviously have a lot of free time on your hands and have run out of material to post recently. My advice is to stop subtly attacking people on the forum and if you don&#039;t have something to contribute to this thread -- and we see you don&#039;t as you didn;t even mention the topic -- then you shouldn&#039;t be here trolling.<br /><br />You&#039;re nothing like you used to be astor. You&#039;ve lost your respect here, at least with more than a few people. As to the topic, I have already answered the OP q. in sufficient depth. I would like this thread to be returned to a discussion on hardened criminals, which is what everyone was discussing before astor showed up and derailed this thread to troll here. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
