				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hey every one! So for those who dont know, Ive got this eternal love for that magical molecule, every thing about it absolutely amazes me. I feel like I can never learn &amp; know enough about it, from the molecular, semi synthetic synthesis , all the way to the actions and reactions it causes in the human mind and body. I know I am not the only one, theres a small, yet quite vast L adoring community, a good portion of which, is present here on the Road.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How about a thread to discuss anything LSD that doesn&#039;t pertain to the other L threads, such as the Avengers, or the vendor review thread. A place where all my fellow Lucy Lovers can come to quell their curiosity about anything L, post and read various excerpts and or quotes, or simply shoot the shit about our trips , past, present and future.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ill go ahead and kick this fucker off with an awesome post from another forum, which quotes Chinacat, that I think is fucking awesome. ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;

				It was written by a man who was part of the Greatful Dead Family who, during the 60&#039;s &amp; 70&#039;s, toured with the band spreading LSD all over America.<br />Some interesting facts about laying LSD, its purity &amp; its importance to mankind. :)<br /><br />Its a long read but you&#039;re interested in LSD i&#039;m sure you&#039;ll enjoy it.......<br /><br /><br /><br />Crystal to Blotter [LSD] <br />________________________________________<br />The information in this thread was generously provided by Chinacat72, a member of Mycotopia forum, in 2005.<br /><br />&quot;I will discuss LSD crystal and what happens with it. This info is from my experiences a long time ago.I can safely offer it because I have retired from this line of work and stay far away from it. <br /><br />First I will briefly discuss the people or family as there called so you can get an appreciation for what they do and have done. The family is motivated to spread LSD because we believe that LSD is a key givin to us from above. LSD was givin to man from god to help him see the error of his ways. Why do you think it was discovered during the most horrible time in history. It is the antidote for the atomic bomb. It`s doesn`t matter if you beleive this or not ,because what i`m trying to express is how deeply important the family feels about the sacred value of LSD. Those who are at the upper level`s of the family will gladly sacrifice there lifes and freedom to do this work. <br /><br />OK now down to the crystal. I have little knowlege about LSD manufacture so i`m going to talk about the final product the crystal. On tour crystal came in brown glass bottles with 1-10 grams in them. The bottles were sealed and contained CO2 and crystal. You can`t just buy crystal from family. First you have to be taught how to lay it ,which i`ll cover in a little bit. Also you have to do a thumbprint(eat it) there are no exeptions to this rule.The reason is to make sure your Karma is clean enough to handle this sacred work. <br /><br />TYPES OF CRYSTAL <br /><br />Needlepoint -very pure(95% ) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. The best of the best <br /><br />White Fluff -Very pure(95% ) white light flakes of crystal. Still around and the most sought after. very pure <br /><br />Silver -Good and clean(85-90% )-light greyish crystal. Was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. Very good stuff. My first thumbprint was this kind. If you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver. <br /><br />Amber -Decent(70%?) This crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.Was always available.One batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.Lot`s a people worked with this crystal but I always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price. <br /><br />Lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. Like amber it varied batch to batch. <br /><br />TJ (tornado juice) - purity unknown. I seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. No experiance with it. <br /><br />Champagne -(50-60% ) black crystal, nasty stuff IMHO. I worked with it once and swore to never touch it again. <br /><br />OK so you got some crystal and need to get it on blotter. It`s a pretty amazing feeling holding a jar in your hands that has 10 grams of crystal in it. That`s 100,000 doses in the palm of your hand. For dealing with laying we`ll say we got 1 gram. Acid is always layed 1 gram=10 tenpacks. A tenpack is tensheets. 1gram=10,000doses. If your laying needlpoint your doses will be 95mcg, because your crystal is 95% pure. If your laying amber your shit will be 70mcg, because it`s 70% pure. got it <br /><br />Now you get a glass pyrex pan to dip your tenpacks in. Your crystal is dissovled into 110ml. of everclear per gram.The purer crystals dissolve instantly with a little stirring. The not so pure take a little shaking. Champange is damn near impossible to get to dissolve evenly. <br /><br />Paper-for white blotter standard watercolor paper#14 or equivalent is used. It`s critical you get the right paper. If you don`t it won`t absorb right and you`ll fuck it all up.Print`s are made up ahead of time and perferated.<br /><br />OK so you got your crystal dissolved and your paper cut and ready. There are 2 schools when it comes to putting it on the paper. First dump the solution in the pan and dip each tenpack into it then lift it up and let any excess solution run off into the pan. Second method is to put the tenpack into the pan and squirt the solution on it with a baby syringe(the ones they give little kids medicine with). I Have done both and prefer dipping them just because its quicker .Then the tenpacks are layed out to dry which doesn`t take long since alcohol evaporates quickly. If you did it right there will be very little residue left in the bottom of the pan.This redidue is extremely potent and is either soaked up with a piece of paper(called mop up) or made into potent liquid(called wash). Whatever you choose this is saved for your personal use. While your doing all this you get very,very high. As soon as you open the jar of crystal it intoxicates the air. Most people were rubber gloves when doing this some don`t. Just don`t have any plans afterwards. <br /><br />There might be slightly different methods used when laying, but this is how the dead family does it. After the tenpacks are dryed there distibuted and eaten up. Since the end of the Grateful Dead the massive distribution network that used to get rid of so much acid has been broken up badly. Never fear Acid is still out there&quot; <br /><br />LSD is still around though it seems that a majority of the labs are inactive at the moment. This is normal as they don`t produce all the time. Most like the silver family only produce about every 5 years. Though they usually produce enough to last that long. <br /><br />When the Grateful Dead toured massive amount`s of LSD were distributed around the country. On a typical east coast tour 100-150grams could easily be sold. Thats a million to a million and a half doses. This flooded these citys and the lsd trickled down to every nook and cranny of america. By the time it was dry again another tour would roll through the region and resupply it. Plus we would meet people on tour from certain area`s of the country and keep them supplied with the help of the good ole USPS. <br /><br />Sadly when the dead stopped touring this network went into shambles. People fell out of touch and with no shows ,there wasn`t the marketplace for distibution.In turn parts of the country arn`t getting saturated anymore. <br /><br />LSD isn`t moved and sold like the cartel`s move coke and such. It`s handled by a brotherhood of people who truly believe there doing the work of god(or whatever name you call creation). We believe that LSD crystal has to be handled by the right people who are totally committed to the movement. <br />When we moved crystal there was always the feeling that we were protected by a higher power. I can`t tell you how many times i have had crystal or acid on me or my brothers and have been in situation`s where we should have gotten busted and something always protected us. So many times that coincidence is not an option. Why do i think we were protected. Because the family does it for mankind not money. We viewed LSD as the only hope for the radical change in conciousness that would save us. So in effect we viewed are work as the work of God. You know why they never busted a family lab? Because we would never betray LSD. Just as Jesus was nailed to the cross we were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail or die to protect what we viewed as the salvation of are species. Sound`s a little dramatic doesn`t it, but i`m trying to give you an understanding of the faith in LSD that the family has. <br /><br />By the way the Kansas bust was not a family lab incase anybody is wondering. The point i`m trying to make is the family believes LSD has to move through the right hands. This is why you can`t go down to the corner and get a gram of crystal. sorry to ramble. <br /><br />As some of the cooks retire i rest assure you that they pass there recipes and secret`s down to those chosen to continue to fight the good fight. I don`t think it will ever be as readily available all over the country as it once was due to the break up of the distribution cycle of tour. I could be wrong and hope i am. <br /><br />Alot of old family have moved on and including myself retired, feeling we served our time. The family does hear your cry`s for more acid and they don`t plan on giving up on mankind. Now&#039;s a good time for labs to be inactive. the current government administration is viewed as a bad storm that needs to pass as jerry sang &quot;all good things in all good time&quot; Keep the faith&quot;<br /><br />&quot;For me and the rest of the people on tour it was just a matter of spending year after year on tour. The elder`s that are on top keep in a eye on everybody that help`s move there stuff. They also know the intentions of those people. If they know your true and a total believer in the work they start letting you hang around. <br /><br />Many hour`s are spent in hotel rooms watching them work. They make sure you know every detail. Also they make sure that you know the importance of being honest and laying your product correctly. Every hit you lay has the potential to change somebody`s life and bring them into the light. It`s taught like an apprenticeship. <br /><br />My first thumbprint was silver. Before my print i thought i was pretty experienced with acid. I had been puddled many times with strong liquid. I wasn`t near as experienced as i thought as i walked into the room and everybody had a huge grin on there face, and i saw what i was about to take. Thumbprint`s arn`t weighed out on a scale. It`s more of &quot;that`s a nice little chunk ,that should do&quot; Your talking several sheet`s or more when you do a print. <br /><br />Fluff and needlpoint are damn pure and i don`t imagine bears was any purer. I have heard of batches of needlepoint being as high as 98% White fluff is gorgous crystal. We would eat this crystal like crazy. When i first met the main guy in charge of this crystal he was snorting it!!!! <br /><br />After i did a fluff print i never did any other kind except needlepoint. When you eat crystal you definatly can tell the differences between them. Purity does matter at that level.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Isn&#039;t a thumbprint dangerous? You&#039;d think a persons mind would be changed forever after doing that amount. <br />&quot;A thumbprint isn`t even close to the largest doses people have done. Dangerous? LSD is physiologicaly one of the safest drugs there are. There`s not one valid death that can be attributed to physiological complications from taking LSD. I didn`t know all this when i was taking it though. <br /><br />Psychologically it could be very negative if the wrong person does it. That`s why we didn`t just walk around the parking lot handing out thumbprint`s. <br /><br />As far as high doses go, it totally opens you up. For about a week afterwards your first print you need some babysitting. Hell you`ve just been reborn! After awhile it`s less tramatic. As for after effects. I am middle aged and healthy. I have 3 bright healthy children. And i`m just getting my bachelor`s degree with a 3.5GPA I do feel high very often though, but i don`t mind. The man that gave me my first print still does crystal once in awhile and he`s in his mid sixties.&quot;<br /><br />You mention the purity varying on alot of the crystal. How are they checking purity? Just roughly with how long it takes to dissolve in a solvent? <br />&quot;I can tell by color. How crystallin it is and what color it is. You can inspect the crystal once you know what good clean crystal looks like. And then you can compare. I have a moto &quot;if it&#039;s white it&#039;s all right&quot;. Of course the jugement on my end is not scientific . I examin it like jewelers do jewels. The only real way to get a very accurate reading on how pure it is comes from the lab. Most decent lab&#039;s have a GC/MS and can get a decent purity reading from that. Needlepoint and White fluff are the only one&#039;s that are reliably consistant. Silver varies a little. Lavender and Amber vary greatly in appearance from batch to batch. Indicating a difference in purity. <br /><br />If I was buying Amber or Lavender I would want to see it first. They have a tendancy every once in awhile to skimp on the last part of manufacture. The rinse and recrysitazation at the end is crucial in determing purity. If this isn&#039;t done enough your product is less pure.Some of you may have heard Owsley say he lost 20% of his product making sure its pure. Thats because he rised it a ton of times. Thats why his shit was said to be better than Sandoz. Amber and Lavender if they don&#039;t due this good there crystal looks more dirty. Also the purer you make your crystal the less it weighs and it&#039;s sold by weight.&quot; <br /><br />

				How long does LSD &quot;stay good&quot;? I mean if i was to take it, put it in a zippylock and then put it in the pages of a book (someplace with unchanging air and no light) &quot;I find that exact method perfect. I took two sheets of needlepoint and wraped them in plastic wrap then A. foil and put them in the middle of a book on a bookshelf. There going on 3 years old and last time somebody tried them they were very potent. They get no light ,air ,and are in a cool enviroment. <br /><br />As for crystal it&#039;s stored in brown glass vial&#039;s that are filled with CO2 and sealed.&quot; <br /><br />You said the Family was always on tour with the Dead. Do you know offhand if any of them ever had the occasion to hang with Jerry and the guys? <br />&quot;A lot of the older guys did. Hell the family started with the Dead and Bear. It&#039;s all connected from the band, crew to the fans and faithful. <br /><br />As for hanging with Jerry myself , no. I got backstage several times, but that doesn&#039;t mean anything. There&#039;s backstage and then there is the bands backstage ,thats off limits. I would much rather be in the crowd. The closest I ever got to Jerry was ten feet as he walked by me and a bunch of other people. I just smiled. I had nothing to say. He had a lot of pressure with all the people who clung to him and thought he was a god. <br /><br />It was really hard for him to deal with and one of the reasons he turned to smack IMHO. I had nothing to say to him ,Except mabye &quot;Play St. Stephen!&quot; <br /><br />I was just curious what kind of sheets were going around when you were into it, was there always different sheets or was there stockpiles of certain kinds? <br />&quot;Over the 8 years I was on tour I saw more prints than I possibly could remember or list. I wouldn&#039;t even know were to begin. Hundreds and hundreds of different kinds. My favorite was plain white unperferated paper. The reason for this was alot of cops don&#039;t know what a tenpack of white unperfed blotter looks like. Once on a Greyhound bus from Floridia to Baltimore our bus was stopped and a bunch of feds got on it. They searched everybodys bags. They were looking for guns or coke since we were coming from floridia. I&#039;ll never forget the feeling of watching a federal agent (FBI I believe) go through my bag and pull stuff out. I had a gram(ten- tenpacks or 10,000 doses) of white paper. He pulled it out and had no clue what it was . It looked like just a bunch of ten inch square pieces of paper to him. Had it be perferated and had a print on it he probably would have known. After that I was a true believer in white unperfed paper. <br /><br />Print&#039;s are usually made in mass amounts and then sold to the different familys. So one kind of print can actually have several different kinds of crystal on them. This happened years ago with the Jesus Christ prints. The first ones were made of very pure white fluff and they were dipped to contain a little over 100mcg. People went nuts over them and the were the talk of the summer. Then the lavender family got hold of the same print and put there dirty ass crystal on them and they were about half the strength as the original white fluff batch. <br /><br />People should know the truth about LSD. The internet is the perfect medium to transfer this knowlege. Just enough info can be given to paint a general picture of how things work, without giving specifics that would endanger this important work. I am in the perfect position to do so. I am long enough removed from the active scene to offer information without endangering anyone including myself. My friends that still live in the old world are very supportive. <br /><br />Now it seams lifetimes ago. I was just a tool in a very large tool box. The family was around long before I came around. Luckily it was in a time when a lot of the older folks were around to help with the scene. For me LSD is a gift and tool given to man from the heavens. I truly believe it is here to point us back towards the light. These values are the same with almost all the family. <br /><br />After you get a glimpse of eternity you can&#039;t help ,but want to share it with others who need it.&quot; <br /><br />Sand, Scully, and Owsely were the original chemists working for the family? <br />&quot;Yes, all 3 were family. Owsely was the original chemist of the Dead scene/family. He set many of the standards and ethics still held today. He also got Sand and Scully involved and doing this work for the people not money. Sand and Scully were in The &quot;Brotherhood of Eternal Love&quot;. Back then it was basically all one big network or family. After the feds broke up the BEL in the 70&#039;s is when people split off and ran smaller labs,networks and were known by there product. <br /><br />I would also like to note that when all 3 were busted they were all threatend with huge sentences. They kept there mouth shut and served very little time in comparison to how much they could have served. <br /><br />Pickard was family many years ago. He has been busted for manufacturing 3 times. On his second bust he ran his mouth to the feds about other drug activity within the scene resulting in several people getting prison time. After that he was shunned and nobody in the family would work for him. That is why he had to work with such shady people in Kansas. Had he been working with family he wouldn&#039;t be going to serve a lifetime prison sentence, he wouldn&#039;t have been busted at all. On his second bust instead of biting the bullet and keeping his mouth shut like Sand, Scully, and Owsely, he chose to make a deal. <br /><br />Many years later now he is going to prison for life because he was betrayed in the same way. I do hope that Pickard can get out of prison before his life ends. He has a new kid that was just born and a new wife. He has done a great service to man by making LSD. I would hope that after a few years he can get released and live his remaining years with his new family. I doubt he will be so lucky though. <br /><br />Many of us who have been graced by LSD owe a great debt to these 3 pioneer chemists and the ones that still remain active and unknown today.&quot; <br /><br /><br />&quot;In the days of old tour wasn&#039;t just a time to flood the country with LSD, but also about making connections. For those of us on the road full time we needed an income when we got back to the bay area. Meeting kind people on tour was always nice, but it also provided an chance to spread the juice when we wern&#039;t traveling. When the Dead toured 4 times a year you would meet all sorts of folks from every nook and crany of the US. Some of these people were chosen to provide for there community. This is a huge link in the distribution chain. And its also in very, very bad shape. <br /><br />When Jerry died there was a lot of folks who quit touring. As people moved around connections were severed. In the old days if you lost track of people you knew you would see them at the next tour. Now thats not an option because there is no tour. People have fell out of touch. People have moved on. So as the years have moved on the existing links have been stretched thinner and thinner.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to think the Brotherhood is just one more lost religion. <br />&quot;I have little faith in the LSD movement ever getting full steam again. I hope i&#039;m wrong. It will always be around, but the not like it was. The distribution system is in shambles. It seems that a whole new generation of younger people lacking the once highly held ethics are ruining things. <br /><br />On a positive note, the psychedelic movement will continue. Things change and may seem dark ,but we must continue. The psychedelic experience and man have been together for thousands of years. It survived christianity,it can survive anything. It goes underground now and then, but is there for those dedicated enough to seek it out. If you feel strongly about the benefits of psychedelics then do something positive about it. <br /><br />You can&#039;t expect the old generation to carry the torch forever. A new wave of dedicated folks needs to rise up and continue this work. Can you think of a more important thing to do? <br /><br />i believe there&#039;s a large number of us who would LOVE to get into it and help, how is this possible? <br />&quot;It is going to be tough for any new people to get into this work. This summer has shown that poor choices were made in who would spread the love. Not saying it can&#039;t be done, but it will be tough. It usually takes a few years of hanging around. Your intentions will be tested. <br /><br />Not to worry though, because there are many ways we can all help. <br /><br />First is to become educated and responsible when it comes to psychedelics. Know the facts and when debating sceptics be mature and informed. Most people have very poor info about LSD. Rumors and bullshit plague its myth. The more people we have telling the truth the better. <br /><br />Turn people on. You&#039;ll never make a closer friend than one you turned on. After you get to know the effects of psychedelics you can tell that certain people would benefit from them. Talk to them if they&#039;re willing. Don&#039;t be pushy, but offer them info. Then if they want offer them the chance. The more truthful info they have the better off they&#039;ll be. <br /><br />I am a firm believer that psychedelics can be shown to be useful in mental health. I am in the middle of a 9 year academic voyage to get the proper credentials to help if the chance arises. If we can prove through science and medicine that LSD is benifitial then we make a great step forward. Not only will it help expell the nasty rumors around them, but give people the chance touch the healing energy that LSD can open up. Studies are under way in the US right now. There for conditions like OCD. Even though most of us don&#039;t have OCD this study is important. It establishes the safety of psychedelics. This opens the doors for further studies that cover other areas. Before the scheduling of LSD there was a lot of research being done. Alot of it was very promising. <br /><br />LSD and other psychedelics were placed in the schedule one category and access to them was cut off even to legit researchers. This was a total political move that had nothing to do with the saftey or benefits of LSD. It was about trying to get control of a generation that didn&#039;t want to be under control. Theres many researchers in the world very interested in psychedelic research. These are very bright M.D.&#039;s, PhD&#039;s and scientists. The more help on this front the better. This is were I will spend my remaining years for the movement. <br /><br />Supply- There is always a need for psychedelics. If your totally dedicated and willing to risk your freedom to better this planet through providing psychedelics then all the info you need is available at your finger tips. <br /><br />I can think of nothing more important for the survival of our species and those we live with then for us all to have access to the psychedelic experience.&quot; <br /><br />To give some closure to this thread, a beautiful prayer: <br /><br />-by innerbeing <br /><br />&quot;Let us pray for the Brotherhood, for their infinite compassion, and for their understanding of the sufferings of us unawakened individuals. May they realize that there are many who could benefit from their understanding here and now. We could only hope that they will recognize the need amongst us and they will respond out of their compassionate grace to help us in these dark times. We must generate the loving consciousness that has been lost in this decade.....we must develop loving-kindness for all of our brothers and sisters, and we must share these qualities with everyone at all times. The time has come, my dear Brothers, for a reawakening of the values, of which you hold so dear, let us continue what you have started. We wait with patience for your response....and we shall continue to wait for as long as it takes. Peace be with you all.&quot; <br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;Implications of LSD and Experimental Mysticism<br /><br />THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE OF MYSTICAL CONSCIOUSNESS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The form of psychedelic experience here called mystical consciousness can best be described as a dimension of experience that, when expressed on paper by an experimental subject and subsequently content-analyzed, corresponds to nine interrelated categories, each of which is described below. These categories were derived by Pahnke (1963) from a historical survey of the literature of spontaneous mysticism, including the commentaries of scholars such as William James (1929) and W. T. Stace (1960). As Stace has emphasized, such categories attempt to describe the core of a universal psychological experience, free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations. Some of the categories described below are illustrated by excerpts from phenomenological descriptions of psychedelic experiences. The ontological status of such descriptions may, of course, be debated. Our concern here is simply to present examples of the psychological phenomena being reported.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />1. UNITY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Experience of an undifferentiated unity, we suggest, is the hallmark of mystical consciousness. Such unity may be either internal or external, depending upon whether the subject-object dichotomy transcended is between the usual self and an inner world&quot; within the experiencer, or whether it is between the usual self and the external world of sense impressions outside the experiencer. Both forms of unity are known to occur within the same person, even in the same psychedelic session. Although each form of unity occurs in a different manner, the states of consciousness ultimately experienced may be identical.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Internal unity reportedly occurs in the following manner: Awareness of all normal sense impressions (visual, auditory, cutaneous, olfactory, gustatory, and kinesthetic) cases, and the empirical ego (i.e., the usual sense of individuality) seems to die or face away while pure consciousness of what is being experienced paradoxically remains and seems to expand as a vast inner world is encountered. A sense of movement is experienced within this inner world through numerous so-called &quot;dimensions of being&quot; towards a goal that is felt to have the status of ultimate reality. Internal unity occurs when consciousness merges with this &quot;ground of being,&quot; beyond all empirical distinctions. Although awareness of one&#039;s empirical ego has ceased, one does not become unconscious.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I found myself grunting in agreement or mumbling, &quot;Of course it has always been this way&quot; over and over again as the panorama of my life seemed to be swept up by this unifying and eternal principle... I seemed to relinquish my life in &quot;layers:&quot; the more I let go, the greater sense of oneness I received. As I approached what I firmly believed to be the point of death, I experienced an ever greater sense of an eternal dimension to life. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In contrast, external unity generally seems to occur as follows: Awareness of one or more particular sense impressions grows in intensity until suddenly the object of perception and the empirical ego simultaneously seem to cease to exist as separate entities, while consciousness seems to transcend subject and object and become impregnated by a profound sense of unity, accompanied by the insight that ultimately &quot;all is One.&quot; The subject-object dichotomy transcended may be between the empirical ego and (1) an animate visual object such as another person or a rose, (2) an inanimate visual object such as the leg of a table (Huxley, 1963) or even a grain of sand; or (3) an auditory object such as the music of a symphony. Theoretically, objects of other sensory modalities could stand in polar relation to the empirical ego and be incorporated into experiences of external unity as well.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When looking at the rose as an object, it seemed to &quot;come alive&quot; before my eyes. Its petals seemed to &quot;breathe&quot; as, slowly and gracefully, then unfolded, seeming to express the ultimate in beauty. Fascinated, I watched these movements of &quot;cosmic gentleness&quot; until, suddenly, I knew the rose; that is to say, transcending the dichotomy of subject and object, I somehow became One with the rose, no longer existing as an ego passively viewing an object in its environment. Although in the objectivity of my critical mind, I knew there were no physical changes in the flower, subjectively I seemed to see it in a totally new perspective, a perspective which elicited tears and deep feelings of reverence.... Supporting the ancient monistic school of thought, I expressed the philosophical insight that, &#039;We are all the same thing.&quot;... Another time I commented that, &quot;There is more to beauty than we know.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />2. OBJECTIVITY AND REALITY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Intrinsic to this second category are two interrelated elements: (I) insightful knowledge or illumination about being or existence in general that is felt at an intuitive, nonrational level and gained by direct experience, and (a) the authoritativeness or the certainty for the experiences that such knowledge is truly or ultimately real, in contrast to the feeling that the experience is a subjective delusion. These two elements are connected because the knowledge through participation in ultimate reality (in the sense of being able to know and see what is real), carries its own sense of certainty. It is to this facet of mystical consciousness that William James assigned the term &quot;noetic quality,&quot; writing: &quot;Although so similar to states of feeling, mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect&quot; (James, 1929). Such insight is intuitively felt to be of a more fundamental form of reality than either the phenomena of everyday consciousness or the most vivid of dreams or hallucinations.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I was experiencing directly the metaphysical theory known as emanationism in which, beginning with the clear, unbroken and infinite light of God, the light then breaks into forms and lessens in intensity as it passes through descending degrees of reality... Bergson&#039;s concept of the brain as a reducing valve I now saw to be precisely true.... The emanation theory, and especially the elaborately worked out layers of Hindu and Buddhist cosmology and psychology had heretofore been concepts and inferences. Now they were objects of the most direct and immediate perception. I could we exactly how these theories would have come into being if their progenitors had had this experience. But beyond accounting for their origin, my experience testified to their absolute truth. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Experience of the contents of this category may be expressed in many ways, among which are assertions of having known the origin and goal of history, of having found the answer to the ancient query, &quot;What am I?&quot;, of having intuited the harmonious structure of the universe, of having experienced the primacy of love and the brotherhood of man, or of having realized the reality of life that transcends temporal death.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />3. TRANSCENDENCE OF SPACE AND TIME<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This category refers on one hand to the loss of a person&#039;s usual orientation as to where he is during the experience in terms of the usual three-dimensional perception of his environment, and on the other hand, to a radical change in perspective in which he suddenly feels as though he is outside of time, in eternity or infinity, beyond both past and future. In this state of consciousness, space and time are generally meaningless concepts, although one may feel that one can look back upon the totality of history from this transcendent perspective.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; From the perspective of the Timeless, I could see my life in retrospect and prospect. It was as if it had all been lived through before, as if we had all been here before, and would be here again. There was a strong preordained feeling about this. I began to see a bit into the future. I understood that I should go back and try to work through some unresolved problems in my relationships with others, and that there would be considerable suffering ahead. My own death was also dimly sensed and strangely accepted. I saw the unbroken continuity of my past with my future, which was not contradicted by the feeling that this present experience would remain with me and bring about deep changes. The fact that all was preordained did not contradict living in freedom, fighting for truth and against evil... <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />4. SENSE OF SACREDNESS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sacredness is here defined as a nonrational, intuitive, hushed, palpitant response in the presence of inspiring realities. It is that which a person feels to be of special value and capable of being profaned. Inherent in the nondifferentiated unity of mystical consciousness is a profound sense of holiness and sacredness that is felt to be at a more basic level than any religious or philosophical concepts held by the experiencer. Furthermore, an acute awareness of infinitude is reported, as though one had stood before the Infinite in profound humility, overwhelmed by feelings of awe and reverence. This aspect of mystical consciousness is well reflected in Rudolf Otto&#039;s term, the mysterium tremendum (Otto, 1958, pp. 12-40).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The most impressive and intense part of this experience was the white light of absolute purity and cleanness. It was like a glowing and sparkling flame of incandescent whiteness and beauty, but not really a flame-more like a gleaming white-hot ingot, yet much bigger and vaster than a mere ingot. The associated feelings were those of absolute awe, reverence, and sacredness. Just before this experience I had the feeling of going deep within myself to the self stripped bare of all pretense and falseness. It was the point where a man could stand firm with absolute integrity—something more important than mere physical life. The white light experience was of supreme importance—absolutely self-validating and something worth staking your life on and putting your trust in. The white light itself was so penetrating and intense that it was not possible to look directly at it. It was not in the room with me, but we were both somewhere else-and my body was left far behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />5. DEEPLY-FELT POSITIVE MOOD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This category focuses upon the feelings of joy, love, blessedness, and peace inherent in mystical consciousness. Joy may be exuberant or quiet. Love may vary in intensity from feelings of tenderness, through deeply felt nonsensual feelings of ultimate concern for other persons, to a state resembling prolonged intense sexual orgasm. The latter degree of intensity is generally dissociated from any stimulation or excitation of the sexual organs, being &quot;spiritual&quot; rather than &quot;erotic&quot; in nature. Peace is &quot;the peace which passes understanding&quot; and entails not only deep relaxation, but a conviction that ultimately there is no ground for anxiety.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The feelings I experienced could best be described as cosmic tenderness, infinite love, penetrating peace, eternal blessing and unconditional acceptance on one hand, and on the other, as unspeakable awe, overflowing joy, primeval humility, inexpressible gratitude and boundless devotion. Yet all of these words are hopelessly inadequate and can do little more than meekly point towards the genuine inexpressible feelings actually experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />6. PARADOXICALITY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This category reflects the manner in which significant aspects of mystical consciousness are felt by the experiencer to be true in spite of the fact that they violate the laws of Aristotelian logic. For example, the subject claims to have died or ceased to exist, yet obviously continues to exist and even writes about his experiences. He may claim to have experienced an empty unity that at the same time contains all reality. He may write about non-being that is more than being. He may claim to have felt &quot;out of the body&quot; while he was still &quot;in the body.&quot; He may envision a universal self that is both unqualitied and qualitied, both impersonal and personal, and both inactive and active.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There was awareness of undifferentiated unity, embracing the perfect identity of subject and object, of singleness and plurality, of the One and the Many. Thus I found myself (if indeed the words &quot;I&quot; and &quot;myself&quot; have any meaning m such a context) at once the audience, the actors and the play! Logically the One can give birth to the Many and the Many can merge into the One or be fundamentally but not identical with it; they cannot be in all respects one and many simultaneously. But now logic was transcended... I doubt if this statement can possibly be made to seem meaningful at the ordinary level of consciousness. No wonder the mystics of all faiths teach that understanding comes only when logic and intellect are transcended! ... Logic also boggles at trying to explain how I could at once perceive and yet be those colours and those forms, how the seer, the seeing and the seen, the feeler, the feeling and the felt could all be one; but, to me, all this was so clearly self-evident as to suggest the words &quot;childishly simple&quot; (Blofeld, I966, p. 29). <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />7. ALLEGED INEFFABILITY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When a subject attempts to communicate mystical consciousness verbally to another person, he usually claims that the available linguistic symbols—if not the structure of language itself—are inadequate to contain or even accurately reflect such experience. Perhaps the reason such experience is felt to be beyond words is to be found in a frustration with language, which, in turn, arises out of the paradoxical nature of the essential phenomena and the incomparable uniqueness of the experience itself. One subject likened himself to a cave-man who was momentarily transported into the bustling center of Manhattan and then returned to his cave, suggesting that, when subsequently interrogated by his wife, such a cave-man could not claim that his experience was ineffable in spite of the fact that it seemed intrinsically logical at the time, as though it could be discussed with words by some future generation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To seek to condense any of my experiences into words is to distort them rendering them finite and impure... What is a &quot;transcendent dimension of being?&quot; Such words on paper are little more than metaphysical poetry. Somehow I feel I could better communicate my experience by composing a symphony or by molding a twisted piece of contemporary sculpture, had I the talents required for either form of artistic expression. In no sense have I an urge to formulate philosophical or theological dogmas about my experience. Only my silence can retain its purity and genuineness. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />8. TRANSIENCY<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This category refers to the temporary duration of mystical consciousness in contrast to the relative permanence of the level of usual experience. The special and unusual forms of consciousness discussed above appear, remain for anywhere from a matter of seconds to a few hours and then disappear, returning the experiencer to his usual state of everyday consciousness. The characteristic of transiency indicates that the mystical state of consciousness is not sustained indefinitely and marks one of the important differences between it and psychosis.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />9. POSITIVE CHANGES IN ATTITUDE AND/OR BEHAVIOR<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Persons who have experienced the contents of the eight categories discussed above are also known to report concomitant changes in attitudes (1) toward themselves, (2) toward others, (3) toward life, and (4) toward mystical consciousness itself. Increased personality integration is reported, including a renewed sense of personal worth coupled with a relaxation of habitual mechanisms of ego defense. It is as though Paul Tillich&#039;s assertion that &quot;It is the power of being-itself that accepts and gives the courage to be&quot; (Tillich, 1952, p. 185) has been immediately experienced as true, and one thus is able to &quot;accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable&quot; (Tillich, 1952, p. 164). One feels as though personal problems can now be so confronted that they may finally be reduced or eliminated. One&#039;s faith in one&#039;s own potential for creative achievement tends to be increased, at least at the subjective level. In one&#039;s relationships with other persons, greater sensitivity, increased tolerance, and more real compassion are reported. Theologically trained persons frequently feel that they have acquired new and profound insights into the meaning Martin Buber sought to convey in his term &quot;the I-Thou relationship,&quot; finally knowing the meaning of genuinely meeting another person without the subtle masks that separate man from man. Changed or enlarged attitudes towards life are reported in the areas of deeper sensitivity to values that are felt to be eternal, increased sensitivity to an inner imperative that seeks expression through other-centered behavior, increased vocational commitment, loss of a fear of death coupled with an expanded awareness of the significance of historical existence, and an enriched appreciation for the whole of creation. As an expression of these attitudes, more time may be spent in meditation. The memory of mystical consciousness itself is regarded as deeply meaningful and similar experiences may be sought as a source of growth and strength.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Although attitudinal and behavioral changes such as these are subjectively reported by psychedelic subjects who have experienced the contents of the preceding eight categories, the duration and permanence of such changes and the extent to which they are manifested in everyday existence are topics in need of extensive research. Only after such research is completed can the degree of correspondence between the positive changes claimed by psychedelic subjects and the effects of spontaneous life-enhancing mystical experiences be determined.

				Fun fact, quoted from My Problem Child.<br /><br />&nbsp;1. How LSD Originated<br /><br />&quot;In the realm of scientific observation, luck<br />is granted only to those who are prepared.<br />-Louis Pasteur&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Time and again I hear or read that LSD was discovered by accident. This is only partly<br />true. LSD came into being within a systematic research program, and the &quot;accident&quot; did<br />not occur until much later: when LSD was already five years old, I happened to<br />experience its unforeseeable effects in my own body-or rather, in my own mind.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Albert Hofman

				i used to do acid.<br /><br />i don&#039;t really want to do it anymore because i like my current personality and don&#039;t want acid to shatter it.<br /><br />my first few big acid trips were groundbreaking for me, but after that was done i found something lacking.&nbsp; i would spend most of the trip thinking in depth about other, more intense psychedelic experiences, with drugs like Salvia and DMT.&nbsp; i think acid is good for analyzing those kind of high-intensity/short-duration psychedelics.<br /><br />but then i got to the point where my normal daily mindset would probably be experienced as &quot;tripping&quot; by a square person.<br /><br />i view acid as the &quot;cure&quot; for western society.&nbsp; it breaks you out of the box we&#039;re born into here.&nbsp; but, for me, after that had been completed there was nothing left for me.&nbsp; psilocybin, for example, seems to be a separate entity/deity which can impart foreign information unto me.&nbsp; never really got that feeling from acid.<br /><br />i definitely recommend it to people who have yet to become satisfied by it.&nbsp; but i think it was Alan Watts who said, &quot;once you get the message, hang up the phone.&quot;

				Hey souldcreeper, the L community is always willing to lend a hand my friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;Now I don&#039;t know much of anything about india,&nbsp; there is lots of ways to purchase btc . The easiest I would say is bitinstant for cash deposits. Though you will read lots of mixed reviews on their company. I personaly use them, but i am not sure that this option is available to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also if you&#039;ve come to the understanding that there is no service like this available to you, then I would suggest you do some reading about SR btc vendors,&nbsp; such as Sugarmama. Goodluck!

				I kind of agree with both typtap and Joey Terrifying. Once I discovered who I was on an LSD trip, I no longer felt the need to use LSD for spiritual purposes.&nbsp; But for creative and recreational use, LSD continued to retain tremendous value for me.<br /><br />I personally think that LSD is better than DMT. I may be wrong, but I think DMT gets a lot of hype because it produces very powerful hallucinations, which people mistake for spiritual experiences. If I want to hallucinate, I&#039;ll take DMT, but if I want to see God, LSD would be my drug of choice, followed by mescaline.

				&nbsp;So here is some more literature from My Problem Child, by Hofman, for all that is interested=0)<br /><br />&quot;First Self-Experiment by a Psychiatrist<br /><br />In his paper, W. A. Stoll also gave a detailed description of his own personal<br />experiment with LSD. Since this was the first self-experiment published by a psychiatrist,<br />and since it describes many characteristic features of LSD inebriation, it is interesting to<br />quote extensively from the report. I warmly thank the author for kind permission to<br />republish this extract.<br />At 8 o&#039;clock I took 60 mcg (0.06 milligrams) of LSD. Some 20 minutes<br />later, the first symptoms appeared: heaviness in the limbs, slight atactic<br />(i.e., confused, uncoordinated) symptoms. A subjectively very unpleasant<br />phase of general malaise followed, in parallel with the drop in blood<br />pressure registered by the examiners.<br />A certain euphoria then set in, though it seemed weaker to me than<br />experiences in an earlier experiment. The ataxia increased, and I went<br />&quot;sailing&quot; around the room with large strides. I felt somewhat better, but<br />was glad to lie down.<br />Afterward the room was darkened (dark experiment); there followed an<br />unprecedented experience of unimaginable intensity that kept increasing in<br />strength. It w as characterized by an unbelievable profusion of optical<br />hallucinations that appeared and vanished with great speed, to make way<br />for countless new images. I saw a profusion of circles, vortices, sparks,<br />showers, crosses, and spirals in constant, racing flux.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -A.

Just had some extra love laying around, and a desire to share.<br /><br />photonsounds - My noob policy is just in place because I ship strictly first class no tracking, so am trying to protect myself, however you sound as if you&#039;re acclimating to the road quite nicely, so feel free to place an order for a 5 strip if you&#039;d still like. I have actually been processing orders much quicker than my profile states too :)<br /><br />dirtybiscuitzz718 - Thanks for the thread! LSD is your cousin frank&#039;s favorite tool ever - and no, you can&#039;t beat good old family fluff, it&#039;s what my headstash is full of ;) The stock I have is not new to the road, and I fully believe in honesty so if you have a bunch of time on your hands, you can read on it&#039;s (admittedly dated) history here <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13845.0&nbsp; <br />Local, and initial sample reports seem positive, and I have a decent amount of love in transit so hopefully so reviews will trickle in soon.<br />All the best!

				In the recent past I purchased some of 3Janes 80ug L.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t a really a trip report, but it is important for me to share my story because of the impact LSD has had on my life in the last year.&nbsp; <br /><br />Part 1: My background <br />I&#039;ve Been taking various party drugs for the past 15 years.&nbsp; I started with MDMA on the weekends (1 or 2 pills) and slowly progressed to 30 pill binges and taking a mixture of other party favors along the road.&nbsp; Drugs were available to me at know cost and in unlimited amounts.&nbsp; Included in this list is GHB, Ketamine, Weed, and Cocaine.&nbsp; I can admit that due to the extremity of my abuse on these drugs I went into a depression that I hid from all of my loved ones. <br /><br />Part 2: The encounter with &quot;The Wizard&quot;<br />I work a blue collar job and had the pleasure of meeting someone that for the sake of my story I will call The Wizard.&nbsp; Wiz was a international philosophy honors student who came from a wealthy family.&nbsp; His father had told that there are good people in Canada.&nbsp; Find them and make them even better.&nbsp; In the months to pass I got to know him quite well.&nbsp; He knew my background and some of the habits I have and had.&nbsp; At this time my drug use was harnessed because I had recently became a father.&nbsp; But the depression was still kicking around.&nbsp; A couple times a month I&#039;d grab a hand full of pills, or a ball of&nbsp; K or Coke and have a night out.&nbsp; Nothing out of hand but it seemed to be a good crutch to mask my feelings of self worthlessness.<br /><br />Part 3:&nbsp; My introduction to LSD.<br />At times, The Wiz and I would enjoy a night with some of the above mentioned drugs.&nbsp; One night we were talking and LSD came up.&nbsp; He asked if I have ever tried it and I said no.&nbsp; He got to talking about how his old man believed the LSD could play a legitimate role in making the world a better place.&nbsp; He mentioned that if it was handled in a more responsible manner and not thrown to the masses by the Leary`s of the world, it would probably be used legally today.&nbsp; He mentioned how Steve Jobs had listed it to be one of the more profound things he had done in his lifetime.&nbsp; This sparked my interest but by then end of the night it had passed.&nbsp; I woke up in the next morning and LSD was the furthest thing form my mind.<br /><br />Part 4: `Don`t find L, it finds you.<br />A couple of weeks had passed, and I ran in to a good friend I hadn`t seen in a few months.&nbsp; This guy always has the best quality weed.&nbsp; He invited me by his home to have a puff and I accepted.&nbsp; Note: This guy has never met the Wiz before.&nbsp; We get to talking and he asked if I was interested in buying some LSD.&nbsp; I chuckled and told him why not!&nbsp; Grabbed 25 and went on my way.<br /><br />Part 5: The breakthrough <br />Talked to The Wiz and told him what I had.&nbsp; He told me to eat 1 so I did.&nbsp; Had a good time, strong visuals, some interesting thoughts, nothing profound.&nbsp; I gave some to the wiz had 8 left for myself.&nbsp; A couple week later I had a few days of work so I decided to take 2 this time.&nbsp; Things were more beep, got a deep sense of feeling of love for everything and everyone in my life.&nbsp; Called The Wiz, talked seem deep shit with him and he told me to take the other 6, so I did (I would not advise on other rookies doing this.)&nbsp; This is when I went through ego loss,&nbsp; I must have died and been reborn 3 or 4 times.&nbsp; Things were well after this I was really humbled in my life.&nbsp; Felt rejuevinated. Only one problem, I couldn`t sleep. 4 or 5 days went by, still no sleep.&nbsp; Thats when things got a littles nuts.&nbsp; My sister came over.&nbsp; She`s a straight edged corporate villan. :o&nbsp; I explained to her what she was doing to people.&nbsp; Gave her the whole people before process spiel and it really pissed her off.&nbsp; Before you know it, my fathers there and they`re trippin on me.&nbsp; I squared up with them and told them that I ate some LSD and I wasn`t sleeping well.&nbsp; Before you know it, the Police and paramedics are at my door.&nbsp; They asked if I was high, I said not any more.&nbsp; They said I had to come with them.&nbsp; I said OK, then they puled out this huge ass syringe.&nbsp; I said fuck that, threw the paramedic to the ground when he tried to poke me.&nbsp; That`s when the handcuffed and injected me.&nbsp; I woke up in a room with no doorknob.&nbsp; FUCK ME!!!!<br /><br />Part 6: Unit xx<br />Psychiatrist came in to talk to me and ask if I knew why I was here.&nbsp; She told me that I was dillusional.&nbsp; She said that I wanted to sacrifice myself.&nbsp; I told my sister I would sacrifice myself be going to the hospital.&nbsp; She also said that I thought my baby could make a difference in the world.&nbsp; What kind of father would I be if I didn`t have hopes like that? Anyways... irrelevant to the outcome of the story but that moment pissed me right off!<br /><br />My wife told me that they had me hooked up to machines when I was asleep and they were running tests on my brain because they hadn&#039;t had an LSD case in over a decade. When they were ready to release me a few days later, the doctors told me that I&nbsp; was on the verge of going nuts and that if I ever touched LSD again, I would end up pemanently brain damaged for the rest of my life.&nbsp; He said my brain will be n a very delicate state for as long as I live.<br /><br />At this point, I am really confused, because I feel like new man.<br /><br />Part 7: 8 Months of Terror... Then to the present.<br />In the last 8 months I&#039;ve had no desire to self medicate although have been enjoying the occasional evening of recreational night of drugs in total moderation. No depression.&nbsp; This is clearly from the breakthrough I had on LSD.&nbsp; But I had a new problem.&nbsp; I was told that there is something wrong with my brain.&nbsp; I did some research and said that underlying mental problem can come out when some people take LSD.&nbsp; Well I must be one of those people then.&nbsp; That must be what the doctor&#039;s were saying.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why has my quality of life seemed to have improved then?&nbsp; This racked my mind for months.&nbsp; And the lord behold, LSD found me again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Part 8:&nbsp; Returning the favor though 3Jane<br />The guy that sold me the LSD called me and asked if I could find him some Lucy. I told him I have a way to get some but it will take a week or so.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t mind s I jumped on the road, and the timing was good for me to grip 25 of 3Janes&#039;s Mayan&#039;s.&nbsp; A week later they arrived. He wanted 10 so I had 15 left in my possession.<br /><br />Part 9: Fuck the Docs or Permenantly fuck my brain.<br />Well the title says it all.&nbsp; Either my feeling are legit or the doctors are right and I&#039;m gonna go off the deep end. I talk to my wife about this.&nbsp; Now my wifey is a very spiritual colombian woman with a history of mystical wisdom if you will that goes back generations.&nbsp; Really deep and interesting stuff anyways.&nbsp; She told me to do it and not to sweat it.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t go buck wild. <br /><br />Part 10: I&#039;m right they&#039;re wrong.<br />&nbsp;I buckle up and take 2 tabs.&nbsp; An hour in I feel nervous but good.&nbsp; Feeling get stronger my mind is racing.&nbsp; For a brief moment I feel my mind slipping away but my girlfriend is there to guide me along the way.&nbsp; For a person who does not touch psychedelics she sure knew what I was thinking and handled me like a champ.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t long before I was crying.&nbsp; This entire period, I have been questioning my mental stability and it&#039;s just fine.&nbsp; Last year I went through a big change in my life thanks to LSD. These cookie cutter generic stereotypical doctors do not understand the great qualities LSD holds.&nbsp; In the last few weeks I have taken LSD 1 more time (3 @ 80ug) and had a blissfull time with no mental uncertainty.&nbsp; I think I am living proof that LSD is a real game changer. <br /><br />LSD is like anything else, if you respect it, it can do wonders.&nbsp; The Wizard new what he was doing.&nbsp; I would have eventually fallen asleep and could have avoided the hospital incident completely.&nbsp; He got me to take a 1200ug dose of LSD and it changed me just as he expected.&nbsp; He regretted not babysitting me through the experience, but I would change any of it at all.&nbsp; The last thing he said to me before he left was... WELCOME TO THE 0.01%.<br /><br /><br />Anyways.. Boring to read or all over the place? Who knows? I want to share it with other believers and to thank 3Jane for the clean product.<br />Peace and Love,<br />Paisita<br /><br />

				O.k. Just got my first SR orders. Two tabs LSD from cousin frank and two tabs WOW(Lsd) from the good guys. Both orders came on same day. This will be far from my first experience with LSD however I haven&#039;t taken it in several years. I am a 2nd year college student and have just been taking care of that lately. I am at the point now where I feel like I could really benefit from bringing Psychedelics back into my life. So tonight I will be dosing cousin franks tabs and updating tomorrow. Until then.<br /><br />In response to Shiva moon: My opinion is that for your first time you should use each Psychedelic separately. Maybe with several days in-between. Hopefully by doing this you will be able to understand and appreciate the different qualities and benefits of each separate substance. After that you will have the understanding that will allow you to make the decision for yourself. Hope this helps. :)<br /><br />Also, I would just like to state that there are many informative books and research articles on psychedelics out there. It helps to understand these amazing gifts.<br /><br />Thanks to my cousin frank for the quick delivery and beneficial messages!

				@dirtybiscuitzz718<br /><br />Yeah I guess I&#039;ll just cut em up and try it like that. The article I read said they put it in water and dosed from that, but whatever. The goal of the experiment is to see if a low dose can act as a nootropic. I wanted to try coding a website while on a small amount and see if I can work on it. If I take a whole tab, I don&#039;t give a fuck about a computer/website for the next 8hrs.<br />That comes after the micro-dose experiment.

				For any one that missed it in the Avengers thread. My over view of JerseyCows (now officially an OK vendor) avatar tab. <br /><br />Soo, JerseyCows sample tab arrived yesterday.<br /><br />First things first, the stealth was fairly good. Not to compare to Jane or some others, but never the less, very proffesional , simple, and discrete. The tabs arrived about 5 days for so after having beens sent out.<br /><br />Now before I begin the review ill have every one note, that i had been on a 1/2 of a roxy.. about 15mg of oxycodone, before a hour or two before dropping the tab.<br /><br />&nbsp;About 7pm , drop the tab, just as i was finishing up cooking dinner for the wife and a buddy. 8pm, we all took a ride to smoke some pot by the intercoastal waterway. around this time i began to get the first tingles up and down my body, at about the 3 hours mark is when it began to take hold, by this time we where on the roof level of a large, completely desolate , parking garage, over looking the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;Enter; all the wonderful effects of a clean well dosed tab of L. The clouds began to dance, and all the street lights began to glimmer, eventualy turning into a entire village of tiki torches. Every 15-20 min or so, I would get what i like to call, &#039;The Haze&quot;..when I feel as if huuge gusts of thick fog begin to swoop down and fill all the air above and around me. Looking up into the partially clear sky I begin to get beautiful kolidascopic patterns, swirling all through out my view of the sky.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The wife begins to get cold, we head back to the house. she eventually ends up throwing my buddy out because he dropped a tab of Redhempfields 25c blotters, and began to bug her out LOL. So the rest of the night was enjoyed with her and I laying in bed, having mind blasting sex, (notice i say mind blassting, not mind blowing, anything can blow your mind) and eating fresh cut pineapples and straw berrys, which was an experience all in it self , as it always is. There was hardly any body load, and that which I slightly felt, like some very faint nausia at times, was most probably due to the Oxy.<br /><br />&nbsp;At about 10pm, is when the intense visuals began, amazing fractals , wild vivid colors and swirling patterns everywhere i looked. I cant say I had any particular state of mind that i would deem notable, mainly because the entire time i was more focused on how good i felt, so warm and fuzzy.. in a sense it was kind of a dopey trip because of pairing&nbsp; with the Oxy, never the less i felt like 1,000,000 bucks! Not much ego loss at all through out the trip, some brief moments of zoning out, but no ego death. My system was totally clean, i hadn&#039;t dosed in about 4 weeks, but it usually takes about 300ug or better , paired with huge blunts of marijuana to get me to that point, so this is not a down point.<br /><br />&nbsp;The night came to an end, for the most part at around 12midnight , when for some reason i became incredibly lethargic, so we fell asleep, which was in no way a trouble of any sort. I had wonderful, vivid trip dreams, half awake half unconscious . I woke around 4am, I think because I was no longer stoned anymore, so I got up, packed a bowl and dropped in the forums for some quick reading whilst hitting the bong. so this is now 9hours after dropping the tab, and i realize im still having light visuals and a nice little head trip going on. The wife moans, I get back in bed and sleep wonderfully through out the rest of the morning. These tabs where most def as advertised at about 150mics, Now that could be a little less. but with out a doubt in my mind over 120ug for sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;I give this L a solid 8.5/10.<br /><br />Keep in mind folks, this is all just my honest opinion. Every ones thoughts and experiences will vary. Hope this report will suffice. Have a great Monday every one=0)

				Never having used acid (I&#039;ve had a week non-visual experience on truffles once but that&#039;s it) I got 10 tabs of alleged 150 microgram LSD off a vendor here, assuming based on the seller&#039;s proclamation that 1 tab = 1 trip that it would last me a while, but I took 1 and nothing happened, then I took 2 (from the opposite side of the strip fwiw) and exactly the same nothing happened again (I should specify that &quot;nothing&quot; means I had an experience similar to a weed brownie but weaker in many respects and not that it was total bunk), and so quite annoyed I decided to share a single tab with a friend who has never used any drugs, and she got blasted into a different plane of existence. She was non-verbal for 2 hours, giggling for a long time with her eyes closed and once tears streamed down her face as she giggled, and when she finally spoke she started rambling about how we were on a river and I had been talking to some fishes who were very interested in what I had to say, and how her body was made up of different parts which all responded to my voice individually. Sitting with her was way more of a trip than my 2 tabs had been!!<br /><br />So I now have to assume that I have some kind of partial immunity to LSD or something rather than the acid being weak, which sucks for me because it will at least triple the price of admission in the future, but I also have to wonder what the reason would be that a person would fail to trip like that...

Also if you work your self up into expecting some thing particular or much different from what L actually does you will almost keep yourself convinced that you are not tripping.<br /><br />&nbsp;2) I suppose there is a slight possibility that these tabs you had where either, a) much weaker than described, along side being laid incorrectly... or b) not L at all and undredictable nBOMES. <br /><br />&nbsp;Wish I could be of further help =0/

She was non-verbal for 2 hours, giggling for a long time with her eyes closed and once tears streamed down her face as she giggled, and when she finally spoke she started rambling about how we were on a river and I had been talking to some fishes who were very interested in what I had to say, and how her body was made up of different parts which all responded to my voice individually. Sitting with her was way more of a trip than my 2 tabs had been!!<br /><br />So I now have to assume that I have some kind of partial immunity to LSD or something rather than the acid being weak, which sucks for me because it will at least triple the price of admission in the future, but I also have to wonder what the reason would be that a person would fail to trip like that...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>some people have high thresholds of resistance to LSD.&nbsp; if that&#039;s the case, increase the dosage. you can take another blotter within the first 2 hours. if you are on an antidepressants, antipsychotic, or have taken other psychedelics this can block the effects of LSD.&nbsp; there are also differences in the quality and potency of the acid that is offered by various vendors... if all else fails, try smoking some weed with the acid. this can amplify the effects

				i personally love lucy. a lot more fun than shrooms bc i feel like i&#039;m more in control.&nbsp; the problem for me is dosage. i know i&#039;m usually getting ~100 mics but the difference between a 90 or a 125 mic dosage when you&#039;re doing 5 hits is intense lol

				Oh my fuck...<br /><br />After 2 failed trips, 4 tabs did me.<br /><br />Once I came up, I experienced the most intense euphoria of my life.<br /><br />I was watching Fear and Loathing while I waited, and then when the visuals (which were just &quot;pulsing textures&quot; and &quot;uncountable constantly changing and moving grains&quot; type things in the walls) kicked in I felt this release that I&#039;d finally got what I&#039;d been waiting for, and I just burst into manic laughter that wouldn&#039;t stop for 3 whole hours. I have never, ever laughed so hard or for so long alone or with anyone in my life. Pausing the movie to go urinate every 5 minutes (by far the most annoying aspect, as by the end of the day my pockets were full of candies from a dozen convenience stores because I just could not walk 50 yards without needing to use a bathroom) and seeing how the visuals had changed slightly each time, and stopping to stare at shit and talk to myself about how, maybe colors originally used to be this bright and nobody ever had to go to piss ever, but the fall of man had robbed us of it and the LSD allowed me to glimpse Eden and turned my dingy bleak winter kitchen into a bright fruity jungle of red kettles and green coffee cans and orange... oranges, and this bleary cycle of bliss just whisked that time right out from under my nose and the next thing I knew it was 3 hours later and I was thinking fuck it--I&#039;m going outside. A few times it got intense but I never approached a bad trip. In fact save for when I stared at a person&#039;s face too long and tempted their eyes to blend together and recoiled in horror when they did, it would be hard for me to even imagine what a bad trip would be like.<br /><br />Anyway, since 10 tabs (which I had expected to last me at least 5 trips) minus 1, minus 2, minus 1 more to test on a friend, and then minus 4 only leaves me with 2, which I know won&#039;t do it for me, I am officially in a long distance relationship with LSD--head over heels in love until I can get my hands on more.

				For those who missed it on the avengers thread...<br /><br /><br /><br />Hello every one, I received my 5 strip of TabMonsters &#039;Owsley&#039; tabs, the Sumos. TM confirmed that they where resales of ETMs Sumos at a discounted price, because they where infact not 200+ mics, but rather more like 125ug. I can attest to them being very clean and certainly 100+ mics.<br /><br />&nbsp;Two friends and I droped one each, then measured up the last two (which perfectly enough, where not perfd for some reason) into 3 equal parts. They where absolutely tasteless. We dosed an hour before going into a plantarium laser light show of the Beatles, Pink Floyd &amp; Zeppelin.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The come up was clean and slow, slow for me anyway, my buddys seemed to be &#039;there&#039; about 20 min before I was. By the time I entered full trip mode, the show became far to intense for us, we decided to hit a world renowned beach, where we ultimatly stayed until sun up. Laughing all night, mostly at the one friend that it was his second L trip and first actual one. The shit this guy was saying had me pissing. Everything that was said or done or happend, in his dosed mind, where all some how related and inter twined with one another. He believed that the police that rode over on their ATVs and told us the beach was closed because of how many ships there where on the water that night, LOL. The visuals where not all that, and over all it wasnt very intense , but I think its because I droppd a JerseyCow tab only a week ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;Over all the tabs where worth the price and as always super fast to arrive. I also recently received another 5 strip from TM of the czech-25 xtal, that seem to be getting mixed reviews. Ill be dropping those in a few days &amp; give my 2cents on that as well. Much love every one!

				So when you get a sheet to last you a long time, would you usually break it up into smaller strips to prevent frequent exposure to air for the rest?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about getting a little air-tight mason jar and a lot of little ziplock baggies, then making 20 5-strips, then putting these in the jar and filling the jar with maybe white rice as a desiccant. Maybe leave it in an unheated room wrapped in dark cloth for the winter and then transferring to the freezer when it starts to warm up. I can keep 1 5-strip in a book at all times for whenever I want to dose and the rest will stay unexposed.<br /><br />Is there a much better way to do this?

I use&nbsp; a book as well, only i made little wax paper pockets and taped them in the center of the book. My supply never lasts longer than a few weeks, so i wouldnt be able to cmment on seperating the tabs to protect the others.

				I had a sample tab of the alex grey and I would rate it @150ug +-<br /><br />It felt like nice clean L and had a typical come up for me, good body energy and a great mood lift with visual enhancement I would expect from this dose!<br /><br />Around +1.30 I remember stopping to look at a lovely bit of beech paneling and really appreciating the grain of the wood and the life of the tree that produced it, Christmas lights were also quite pretty!<br /><br />I held off until +2.30 so I could gauge the dosage / feel of the tab as accurately as possible but then I topped up with 2 drops of liquid sold as 150ug but closer to 125ug IMHO!<br /><br />After this I lay down for a while and listened to some music enjoying an assortment of lights and some deep introspective thought with good oev&#039;s + cev&#039;s, there was some softening of the ego but no complete loss.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to say how long I lay there for as before I start tripping hard I always turn clocks to face the wall, the idea of being governed by any time other than natural time dose disturb me whilst tripping&nbsp; hard!<br /><br />As dawn broke I went out for a walk it was a crisp frosty morning but I saw much beauty in the world around me and felt a strong afterglow throughout the day!<br /><br />My liquid is almost gone now but there is the rose crystal about (£13,000 / G at this source) so the liquid will surely be there as well&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Peace and love to the world and that I mean with all my heart&nbsp; :-*

				hey guys, first post in this thread, just wanted to ask something :P<br /><br />With 10 tabs arriving, from LucyDrop(which will be my first time doing LSD), I was wondering, what should I stock up on or do you have any suggestions on what I should do/eat/drink or what I shouldn&#039;t do? <br /><br />Asking because, when you do shrooms they tell you not to eat like 6 hrs before taking them in and eat/drink lots of vitamin C...

The L is not like the Mushys that often get lots of people sick, though its not totally un common for one to feel some nausia and stomach discomfort when on the L come up. Its far less intense than any mushy sickness. Try to keep your pre trip diet light, avoiding anything greasy and bad for you. the vitamin C on mushys is to hasten the conversion of psilocyben to psilobin, thus making you trip balls almost immediately. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;When you drop the L, esp since it is your first time, be sure to be some where safe, and as secluded from the outside world as possible, interaction with any one who isnt tripping is quite difficult for the novice tripper, let alone dealing with and having to interact with total strangers . Make sure you are very comfortable with the place you will be trpping in, if possible shut off your phone, it will be your enemy all night. There is a thread here with loadss of amazing things to expercience while on L, def check that out. Also any fresh fruit is absolutely incredible, but i love fried chicken when im tripping as well, so what to eat and how good it will be all depends on what you like and how much you like it. One thing almost every one can agree on is freshly cut pineapple. <br /><br />&nbsp;I could go for days, if theres anything specific you would like to know just PM me. Happy travels friend!

				I love acid, it lets me tap into reality and see everything the way it is. Really everything is moving and shifting all the time in other dimensions and we just don&#039;t see it because our brain dumbs it down for us. Acid allows us to see what is actually there, which is why it is so frightening but beautiful. The universe looks so complex already but it is much more than we can even comprehend most of the time.

				Hey fellow Lucy Lovers, and every one else alike&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp;So tonight is the long awaited, much anticipated Geminid meteor shower! For this incredible event I will be dosing with either 3 of JerseyCows Avitars, or 3 of TabMonsters czech-25 &#039;175&#039;ug tabs. I will be giving a brief trip report probably tm night, as to the strength and cleanliness of the tabs. ( if its the czech tabs I drop, most every one has read JCs feed back from the Avitars and Hoffmans)<br /><br />&nbsp;My only issue here is, Ive tested out JCs tabs, and they are awesome, so there is no question that the experience will be epic. While I have yet to taste the czech &#039;175&#039;ug tabs, Im really itching to drop them, just not sure how great an idea it is to test them out for such an amazing event. Im worried that if they are not anything near their advertised dose and quality, that I will be just buzzn for the meteor shower. Ive been waiting for this for over 2 months now, and i neeeeed to be fuck faced( tripping my nuts off).<br /><br />&nbsp;If any one that happens to see this has by chance dropped TMs czech &#039;needle point&#039; and can give me an idea on strength and dose of them, itd be fucking awesome!.. Even better if whom ever it may be has also droped JCs tabs :D<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for tuning in everyone! Happy adventures to all!!! Much love 8)

				Goooooooood morniiing vietnaam! (Bill Murray voice LOL) <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Soo, fellow psyconauts, Im half way rested, freshly bathed,&nbsp; shaved, smoking this joint and half way paved! Ate a 1/2 of a roxy a few min ago, and im totally stoked to have some time to spend with my favorite anonymous online brotherhood&nbsp; ( Even if it wasnt the my only online community, it would still be my favorite&nbsp; ;)). <br /><br />&nbsp;As I posted thursday, I had a very big night planned, for months now, to drop a nice dose and get totally shitty to watch the meteor shower. Well guys, It fucking sucked :-\&nbsp; Well let me say, nothing that i had hoped for rather, cause with Lucy in my brain nothing can ever be THAT bad LOL. The night turned out mostly cloudy, pretty much all effing cloudy actually and un reasonably cold, for my current location anyway. We did wind up on the beach that had a nice sized window with crystal clear skies, all the beautiful stars out there dancing and shimmering, almost as if the entire sky was some liquid like dimension. While there we got to see maybe 10 or 20 note worthy meteors. Truly incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;Now im not typically one for astronomy, though I do totally dig the universe , In almost every aspect. planets and stars arent exactly my &#039;thing&#039;. The reason I amped my self the fuck up for this &quot;big&quot; meteor shower, was because once upon a time, many moons ago, me and the same buddy i was with for the Geminids, happen to be looking up at the sky when we where like 12 years old, and I notice a shooting star. &quot;Look bro, a shooting star. Did you see that?&quot; ..&quot;no&quot;.. &quot;look, another! and another! and anoth-..whaat the fuuck is going on!?!&quot; Guys I shit you not, it was like the entire sky began to rain dozens of stars per minute! Now that was the first and last meteor shower I have every seen aside from the Geminids ( if it was infact a meteor shower and not some freak occurrence) and for the rest of my life i believed thats what a meteor shower looked like on average.<br /><br />&nbsp; We&#039;ve some to the conclusion that what ever it was our eyes stumbled upon that night, was some sort of once in a lifetime or very very rare event. Ive been meaning to google it and see if i could figure wth it was, if it was even noted and has a name of sorts, but I can not remember much about when exactly it was or how exactly how long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;Any way, we decided on 2.5 tabs each of TabMonsters &#039;czech-25&#039;. Opening statement in reference to that, NO way that they are 175ug. Now, let me give some back round on what ive had going on this past week, so as to better understand why I hardly fucking buzzed at all of such a decent dose, of what was infact good clean L. A friend came to stay with me for a few days from my home town, and for 4 days it was a total shit show. Im talking grams of Ket, tabs of 25c, about 1300ug of L between the three of us, roxys, copious amounts of&nbsp; pot, just a 4 day long dream pretty much. With a few hours of rest in between. The line up went something like this ( as far as the L and RCs go anyway) 3.5 tabs of L, 2.5 tabs of 25c , and some micro (daytime) doses from JCs avitars. That was all in a 6 day span, with the last micro dose of L being the night before the Geminids. <br /><br />&nbsp;So in respects to all that, I do not feel comfortable giving an opinion as to what i believe the dosage to be from TabMonsters czech xtal tabs. What I am very confident to say is that they where infact LEGIT and VERY CLEAN LSD, which I was very happy about&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />&nbsp;Well guys the joint of Sour is fin, I am now 100% paved, laid out, cold stoned, toasted , how ever you like to say it... Im silly high ;D and simply can not think clearly enough to continue on anything i meant to, but did not mention, and edit or three may be along shortly, or not LOL Thanks every one for tuning in!

				Does anyone in this thread have any experience with paranoia and taking LSD? I&#039;ve never taken LSD myself and I want to try it but I&#039;m slightly worried. I get bad phases of paranoia at times. I never get paranoid when smoking but the weed has definitely made it more frequent over the last few years.

LSD makes you very suggestible, so if you think you&#039;re going to be paranoid, you&#039;ll probably get paranoid - at least, until you learn to control the trip, which takes some experience. if you don&#039;t follow this advice, then at least do it in your own home, and not in public (as i did on one of my first trips, resulting in the worst experience of my life), and only do a small dosage. i&#039;ve never &#039;acted out&#039; or done anything stupid on acid, but i&#039;ve had the paranoia spiral&nbsp; so much out of control that i probably could have done something stupid, but thankfully i was too scared of everything to move from the place i was standing in.

				just to chime in a little bit about LE. when i was a young kid, and when most were, we used to look up to police officers. &quot;i want to be a police officer when i grow up&quot; many kids would say. Protect and serve used to be the words to describe LE. but unfortunately, it is no longer the case. everyone lives in fear of LE, slowing down when you are driving because you see a cop, even if you are doing nothing wrong. beign a police officer used to be an honorable profession, but it is now just people who abuse their power :(

				@ sitmanja, I do not feel like going and finding actual statistic figures, but if you seen the numbers and stats of what our nations jails and prisons are actually filled with, you&#039;d find that the majority of inmates are doing their time for petty or meager drug charges. So much so that just about every single jail in the nation is greatly over populated. Yet when you watch the news or read the daily paper, you will find countless articles and segments on the real crimes of our society, &quot;mother and 2 young daughters brutally murdered in their home&quot;, or &quot; another victim of local serial groper emerges&quot;.. ( just examples ).<br /><br />&nbsp; So what does this say for those &quot;good LEO&quot; you speak of?. Ive been in the can, spent a nice chuck of very undeserving time over the decades on the inside, and though just about 9/10 people you meet in there are by their recollection &quot;innocent&quot; (LOL), Its more alone the lines of 1/10 people that are in fact down right evil people, that have zero regard for anything or any one, them selves included, that are rightfully spending the durations of their lives in prison.<br /><br />&nbsp;Go google NYPD ( Im from NYC, and this is greatly to do with why I have such a hatred for LE, cause the NYPD is the single most corrupt, crooked fucked up to high hell PD in our nation, along side the LAPD, NOPD and lots of others im sure) throws 15 year old through window (or NYPD &amp; any act of violence or criminal act for that matter), If you can find that 2 min clip you will see what i mean, just the way they speak and act towards any one that does not have a badge. The kid is a little shit from my area, and thats my local pct. that is filmed behaving that way, its like there M.O. Given the kid and all his little dirtbag freinds&nbsp; are total shits, but c&#039;mon, they went to cuff the kid, essentially for not doing as they said, not actually breaking any laws, and he &quot;resists&quot; by saying &#039;wait wait what did i do&quot; and lightly tugging away or something like that and like three more cops all grab him up pushing him into a store front window so hard his head broke it, the kid is 15! and not a 15 yr old that happens to be 200lb either. Then they continue to shout and theaten and belittle and disrespect every one and every one that was on this corner watching this, it was like 30 people.Things like&nbsp; &quot;you dont run shit! this is myy fucking &quot;hood!&quot; , &quot; we run this muh fucka! &#039;, &quot; back the fuuck up! back the fuck up! ,&quot; you bunch of fucking animals! , every one get the fuck out of here!&quot;, &quot;who the fuck else wants it, we&#039;ve got cuffs for days!&quot;.. they wound up taking like 6 people to jail almost all of which where under 21, and all for some BS argument that two kids where having that lead to a few blows.<br /><br />&nbsp;All of which brings me to my next point, how by doing this.. by this i mean locking kids and adults alike up, who have no prior criminal history no less, charging them with a crime , and sentencing them to X amount of days, weeks, months, years or even decades in prison, they actually obligate that individual, violent by nature or not, to evolve into an animal. Once youve been to jail, you have NO CHOICE but to become the typical criminal that they have labeled you. Whether it be because the AB or one of their sub parts gives you the option to work for them , suck dick, or get killed...Or some essay trys you for your apple during chow, WTF do you do??? I mean theirs obviously always going to be heartless pussys that take the blowing cock and being the entire houses bitch route.. but not the lot of us...YOU BECOME THE SAME AS THE REST OF THEM<br /><br />&nbsp;Look dont get me wrong. There is LEO out there that do actually protect and serve, but from what ive always known, they are few and far apart. Again guys i went a little nuts here lol sorry for the jabber =X

				Excellent mini-rant DB! So true about US jails... reading or even thinking about prison privatization and the drug war can make my physically ill (except for Ricki-Oh, which makes me hungry) :p&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the handful of reasons I could never have kids. The world&#039;s just to fucked and the vast majority of people don&#039;t even pay attention. I&#039;ve never hurt a fly, but 90% of the people around me would agree I deserve to be locked up for untold years because I like something other than fucking nasty alcohol, and prolly 50% of the world at large thinks I deserve to be tortured for all eternity because I am not credulous. <br /><br />On topic though, I got a re-delivery slip in the mail today and I&#039;ve got a package coming tomorrow. It is either a fake letter I sent myself, a sheet of happiness from 3Jane, or both. One of those 3 scenarios will result in severe disappointment but I&#039;m hoping in 12 hours or so I&#039;ll be trippin bawlz yo!

So much so that just about every single jail in the nation is greatly over populated. Yet when you watch the news or read the daily paper, you will find countless articles and segments on the real crimes of our society, &quot;mother and 2 young daughters brutally murdered in their home&quot;, or &quot; another victim of local serial groper emerges&quot;.. ( just examples ).<br /><br />&nbsp; So what does this say for those &quot;good LEO&quot; you speak of?. Ive been in the can, spent a nice chuck of very undeserving time over the decades on the inside, and though just about 9/10 people you meet in there are by their recollection &quot;innocent&quot; (LOL), Its more alone the lines of 1/10 people that are in fact down right evil people, that have zero regard for anything or any one, them selves included, that are rightfully spending the durations of their lives in prison.<br /><br />&nbsp;Go google NYPD ( Im from NYC, and this is greatly to do with why I have such a hatred for LE, cause the NYPD is the single most corrupt, crooked fucked up to high hell PD in our nation, along side the LAPD, NOPD and lots of others im sure) throws 15 year old through window (or NYPD &amp; any act of violence or criminal act for that matter), If you can find that 2 min clip you will see what i mean, just the way they speak and act towards any one that does not have a badge. The kid is a little shit from my area, and thats my local pct. that is filmed behaving that way, its like there M.O. Given the kid and all his little dirtbag freinds&nbsp; are total shits, but c&#039;mon, they went to cuff the kid, essentially for not doing as they said, not actually breaking any laws, and he &quot;resists&quot; by saying &#039;wait wait what did i do&quot; and lightly tugging away or something like that and like three more cops all grab him up pushing him into a store front window so hard his head broke it, the kid is 15! and not a 15 yr old that happens to be 200lb either. Then they continue to shout and theaten and belittle and disrespect every one and every one that was on this corner watching this, it was like 30 people.Things like&nbsp; &quot;you dont run shit! this is myy fucking &quot;hood!&quot; , &quot; we run this muh fucka! &#039;, &quot; back the fuuck up! back the fuck up! ,&quot; you bunch of fucking animals! , every one get the fuck out of here!&quot;, &quot;who the fuck else wants it, we&#039;ve got cuffs for days!&quot;.. they wound up taking like 6 people to jail almost all of which where under 21, and all for some BS argument that two kids where having that lead to a few blows.<br /><br />&nbsp;All of which brings me to my next point, how by doing this.. by this i mean locking kids and adults alike up, who have no prior criminal history no less, charging them with a crime , and sentencing them to X amount of days, weeks, months, years or even decades in prison, they actually obligate that individual, violent by nature or not, to evolve into an animal. Once youve been to jail, you have NO CHOICE but to become the typical criminal that they have labeled you. Whether it be because the AB or one of their sub parts gives you the option to work for them , suck dick, or get killed...Or some essay trys you for your apple during chow, WTF do you do???

You read my rant LOL, the good they do is so few and far apart. Lets not continue, It seems I will not bend on this subject, and neither will you LOL

				Hey every one! <br /><br />So all through the night im having this strange dream, that I dosed before bed and had amazing half tripping half awake like dreams. Funny thing is, I havnt dosed since last thursday. I thought maybe it was because I tracked my pack from NSC at 3am, and seen that it landed in NY, So I figure being where im at right now, it should be here in three days or so. I decided to come home for lunch this afternoon, began to fry up some grub, and sat in on the forums for a few min..when *knock *knock *knock, at the door.. the mail person I thought to myself? WTH is going on? I dont know why but I began to frantically scurry to all the windows, checking out the block. I totally thought some kind of CD was going down. After letting the dog bark for a few minutes, and making sure it was just the regular post lady, I open the door..&quot;express delivery for Mr. Frank Rizzo ( not actually my name, of coarse)..Sign for it, wait about 30 min or so, just to be sure my door isnt getting busted in LOL, open the letter, BAM! 30 hits of good ol&#039; clean Canadian LSD,ehh. <br /><br />&nbsp;NSC finally reshipped after maybe 25 days, maybe more. I had put in for an extension about 2 weeks ago , for 10 days. Three days before SR was supposed to step in, I put in for 100% refund. He had not answered any of my PMs , let alone read them. Same nonsense every one else in his thread was bitching about. Then last thurs or friday, I seen a PM from him stating that hes sorry and he reshipped thanks for the patients and what not. I accept his reship in the resolution center, he provided tracking as well, and it did require a signature, but seeing as how all the other that got their shit signed it didnt bother me, I always scribble for those things anway. So thats literally 4 days, weekend included that it took to get from the very far west end of Canada, to the furthest corner of the south east US. <br /><br />&nbsp;Im just glad it arrived I suppose, I tried his tabs when he was brand new, and it was totally legit and on par with his advertisement . Suffice to say, I prob wont be placing another order with him for a while, at least until its been proven that his attentiveness and punctuality greatly improve, regardless of how good his L is for the low prices he offers. Also his stealth really sucked, I mean given that its blotter, it would take no more effort to actually hide the shit, rather than just throwing it in with some other papers or what have you. <br /><br />&nbsp;All in all, im glad its done and over with and both ends are happy with the finishing results. Ill prob be dosing Friday night, Not quite sure if ill drop these or JCs Ava&#039;s though. Most likely save the Avatars for special occasions, them shits is the beeees kneees! LOL Well fellas, over and out , Thanks for stopping in!

I&#039;m writing it for my own records primarily, but why not share while I&#039;m at it? <br /><br />So anyway, package came in the mail so I went ahead and wrote &quot;return to sender&quot; in the local scribbles and immediately dropped everything and went out to buy a bubble maker and a shit-ton of fruit and vegetables and stuff. <br /><br />Came home, got the shit out of the package, and then due to some disappointment tripping with my first purchase of alleged 150ug tabs recently I decided rather than risk under-dosing I&#039;d go with 4 tabs right of the bat. In hindsight I&#039;m not sure I actually needed that much, but I think I made the right choice. <br /><br />So with the 4 tabs under my tongue, I scramble to handle any new work e-mails and other tedious tasks I don&#039;t want to be waiting for me later, but these take longer than expected and 20 minutes in I’m already feeling weird, so I gotta get ready fast. <br /><br />Although there are lots of places I want to try tipping like karaoke and the aquarium, unfortunately in these parts it&#039;s just too big a risk to get caught outside, so as usual I start with a movie. In my paranoia while waiting for the package I actually shipped my real hard drives elsewhere and installed a fresh empty OS and no media files, so I had to pick something with lots of seeders I could get instantly. I picked Yellow Submarine, which I&#039;d seen before but don&#039;t really remember. <br /><br />I don&#039;t remember much about how the movie started because apparently I came up really fast, but once I got past the usual (for me) extreme hypothermia and tenseness, the next thing I knew I was fucking INSIDE that movie. I don&#039;t know how to explain it except to say that the movie &quot;meta-fullscreened&quot; itself into my brain, but I honestly wasn’t aware of my body or the room for long periods of time. I have a few faint memories of gasping for air, or putting my face right up at the screen with my mouth hanging open in shock and awe of what I was seeing, but basically my entire visual sensory input was just hijacked by the movie and nothing else was there. And what&#039;s more I would occasionally feel like I was somehow inside the scenes in some way that is hard to describe. <br /><br />Anyway that stage is what I call The Coma, because I was basically catatonic. <br /><br />The next memory I have is seeing like, a screenshot of the room I was in, but it was multiplying and there was this red haze and orange swirl, and I started to feel angry--like REALLY seriously fucking angry. And I realized that I was some kind of Bruce Lee-esque figure out for vengeance. I can&#039;t stress enough who visceral and real and palpable that anger was, in spite of it being totally out of nowhere and based on absolutely nothing. <br /><br />Basically for this short time I honestly didn&#039;t know who I was! <br /><br />So I escaped from this anger via a little game you might call &quot;degrees of self&quot;, where I focused on objects and clues around me, and step by step traced them back to remember who I really was. Like, oh yeah, that&#039;s what I use for my job, so... oh yeah! I&#039;m that person who does this boring shit for a living; I&#039;m not actually some Kung Fu master out to avenge my father&#039;s death! <br /><br />This entire mini-ego-death probably only lasted 10 seconds, and of course the anger became laughter again, which by the way at one during my trip caused me to fall down on the floor with my sides cramping up really bad because I was laughing so hard. Good times! <br /><br />The rest is a haze of weird thoughts and just wandering around the house, but one of the more ridiculous thoughts I can remember was that either always had been or had now somehow turned myself into this meat-bag processing device for damned souls to be tormented in, and I was now doomed to live through every unpleasant thought or situation possible from now until I died. Kinda like the Folding@ thing for protein folding for cancer cures, except that Hell was using my brain cycles to process every conceivable torment that could ever exist, one by one, as a way to punish the damned souls, and there was nothing I could do about it. <br /><br />And what if I&#039;m right? <br /><br />What if I have to sit here until I die thinking about or living through every horrible thing that could ever be thought of or experienced? <br /><br />Well, thankfully this batshit line of thinking eventually ended when I got distracted by a bag of chips. <br /><br />It&#039;s worth pointing out that this backwards place I live in doesn’t have central heating, and that combined with the LSD-induced severe hypothermia had me in my ski mask, so in order to eat the chips I had to pull the mask up, temporarily blinding myself. <br /><br />Did somebody say perfect recipe for popping my CEV cherry? <br /><br />Next thing I knew I was witnessing this Milkdroppy fractal factory or some shit that was synced with the sound and rhythm of the crunching chips that I couldn&#039;t stop shoving down my gullet. I was in the God Damned Dimension of the Fractal Chip-Crunching Factory! <br /><br />And once the chips were gone (and oh I just know they&#039;ve made their way straight to my thighs by now boys!), it was time to pull my mask back down. <br /><br />Then I realized I didn&#039;t know what room I was in. So I thought I&#039;d bet myself if I could get it right if I thought for a minute--mentally retraced my steps and shit. So come on, calm down and remember what room you&#039;re in, then pull down the mask and see if you&#039;re right! Fabulous prizes and more will be yours! <br /><br />Bad idea! <br /><br />Now I&#039;m second-guessing whether I&#039;m even in my house at all! <br /><br />What if I&#039;ve actually gone outside in another Coma like the one with the movie, and I&#039;m really in the fucking convenience store, and there’s people and cops standing right there watching me, and in this country you&#039;re as fucked for being high as you are for being in actual possession, which doesn&#039;t fucking matter because walk into my house and I am in fucking possession! And maybe I didn&#039;t pay for the chips either (but as Ricky would say, you can&#039;t go to jail for &quot;theft under a thousand&quot;, heh). <br /><br />So after 10 seconds or so of contemplating this horrific prospect and preparing to reveal my true unmasked identity to a throng of horrified onlookers and cops and prosecutors and the clerk demanding the cash for the chips I just stole, I convinced myself that there&#039;s no way I&#039;m anywhere but my house, so just pull up your damn mask and get on with it you dummy... <br /><br />Anyway there&#039;s some other crazy inside-out CEV shit I&#039;m not even a good enough writer to describe, and even if I could it&#039;s like a good joke--doesn&#039;t work if you have to explain it. And I&#039;ve been up for like 30 hours at this point so that&#039;s probably good enough for my report. And I hope I get a good grade &#039;cause I promise I read the whole fucking book!<br />

				Methamphetamine (20-40 mg, i.v.) partially inhibited the effects of LSD when it was given after the start of LSD action. It also shortened the duration of action of LSD to 2-3 h, and modified the LSD-induced perceptual changes and disturbances in spatial-temporal orientation. The subjects became more open to the researchers and their actions were more related to reality than on LSD alone. However, Hoch (1955, 1956b) gave no exact details about the subjects and the experimental design.<br /><br />Balestirieri (1957) gave amphetamine (20-30 mg, i.v.) to subjects at the height of LSD activity (open, n=8,200ug, p.o.). The effects of both substances were intensified, but not qualitatively modified, accoridng to his observations. <br /><br />Ritalin is a sympathomimetic drug related to the amphetamines. It was used from 1954 to support psychotherapeutic treatment with LSD (Sandison &amp; Whitelaw, 1957; Ling &amp; Buckman, 1963). ...<br /><br />In combination with LSD, ritalin caused, 15 min after i.m. injection, perceptual changes with withdrawal tendencies, distortion of the surroundings, and augmented mental activity. Changes in body image and proprioception were noted, as were changes in mood anf effect. Ritalin modified the LSD effects and allowed the application of lowered doses in LSD in therapy (Ling &amp; Buckman, 1963).<br /><br />In the course of 370 LSD sessions, Kristensen (1962) additionally gave 23 seriously neurotic patents methylphenidate (Ritalin, 30-50mg, i.v.) during 220 sessions. Methylphenidate was administered additively at the height of the LSD effect (150ug, p.o.). The two substances supported each other in their effects. The author developed the hypothesis that LSD caused a process of successively augmented tension, which was discharged by methylphenidate administration. Ling and Buckman (1963) gave methylphenidate 30 min after LSD and observed a reduction of LSD-induced anxiety. Leuner (1981) described the same effects as those described by Ling and Buckman (1963) and Kristenen (1962), based on many years of clinical experience with combination treatment using LSD and methylphenidate. Methylphenidate was administered when the LSD effect began to wane.<br /><br />From Pharmacology of LSD: A Critical Review by Annelie Hintze, pages 119 to 120.

				Hey every one, I found some bitchen literature about LSD purity, this if from CA.1970. Hope every one enjoys it as much as I did.<br /><br />&quot;LSD Purity -- Gospel and Heresy<br /><br />__________________________________________________ _____________________________<br /><br />Table of Contents<br /><br />I. THE GOSPEL A. The Syllogism B. Empirical Evidence: lsd.data<br /><br />II. A HERETICAL VIEWPOINT A. An Analysis of the Syllogism B. What lsd.data Proves C. Subjective Evidence Supporting the Heresy D. Weighing Subjective Evidence Against the Gospel E. Anecdotes<br /><br />III. GUIDEBOOK FOR UNBELIEVERS A. Subjective Indications of Quality B. Precautions C. Storage<br /><br />IV. THE GOSPEL AND THE POLITICS OF LSD<br /><br />APPENDIX: Holy Scripture Revisited __________________________________________________ _____________________________<br /><br />I. THE GOSPEL<br /><br />In reading alt.drugs.* and the literature on LSD in ftp.hyperreal.com, it is clear that there has emerged a central dogma about LSD purity (and quality). It holds that all acid in the form of blotters is in effect indistinguishable from perfectly manufactured LSD-25. Persons suggesting that there may be variations in quality are derided and told to read the FAQ (holy scripture). The Gospel appears to be based on the following syllogism, and backed up by empirical evidence found in the file lsd.data. Subjective evidence supporting or opposing the Gospel is considered worthless given the importance of set and setting in the LSD experience.<br /><br />A. The Syllogism<br /><br />The syllogism on which the Gospel is based goes something like this:<br /><br />Given that: 1) A typical blotter can only hold about 200 ug of drug material. 2) The d isomer of LSD (LSD-25) is the only drug which is psychoactive in such quantities. Therefore: 3) All illicit &#039;acid&#039; packaged in blotter form owes all of its psychoactive effects to LSD-25 and thus any difference in subjective or physical effects are entirely due to difference in dose, set, or setting.<br /><br />I intend to indulge in the heresy of attempting to &#039;refute&#039; this fundamental tenet of the Gospel, which I will also refer to as &#039;the Doctrine&#039;. But before proceeding to vent my blasphemies, I support my synopsis of the Doctrine and its supporting syllogism by quoting directly from scripture: (from ftp.hyperreal.com::drugs/psychedelics/lsd/FAQ-LSD)<br /><br />&gt; ADULTERANTS: &gt; &gt; Several problems are associated with street drugs: their unknown &gt; purity and their unknown strength. Because of its extreme cheapness &gt; and potency, the purity of LSD in blotter form is not an issue: either &gt; it&#039;s lsd or untreated paper. The purity of powders, pills, and liquids &gt; cannot be assumed as safe. With regards to uncertain strength, the &gt; strength of hits these days is low, 100 micrograms or so. One should &gt; be careful and assume that the smallest square in a tiling of a sheet &gt; is a dose, even if a printed pattern covers several. An experienced &gt; person could judge the strength of a dose, and if it is assumed all &gt; doses on a sheet have been processed equivalently, those doses would &gt; be calibrated for others, much like anything else. &gt; &gt; .............................. &gt; &gt; From _Psychedelic Chemistry_ by M.V.Smith, 2nd edition p 5: &gt; &gt; &quot;There is a great deal of superstition regarding purification of &gt; psychedelics. Actually, any impurities which may be present as a &gt; result of synthetic procedures will almost certainly be without any &gt; effect on the trip. If there are 200 micrograms of LSD in a tablet, &gt; there could only be 200 mics of impurities present even if the LSD was &gt; originally only 50% pure (assuming nothing else has been added), and &gt; few compounds will produce a significant effect until a hundred to a &gt; thousand times this amount has been ingested. Even mescaline, which &gt; has a rather specific psychedelic effect, requires about a thousand &gt; thimes this amount.&quot;<br /><br />It is interesting to note how much of scripture is based on the immortal words of the true prophet Michael Valentine Smith. See the APPENDIX for blasphemous attacks on this venerable prophet.<br /><br />B. Empirical Evidence: lsd.data<br /><br />Although the above argument usually suffices for the faithful, the doubters can retrieve a document &#039;lsd.data&#039; from the holy archives which lists results of PharmChem analyses of alleged LSD samples in 1973 and 1974. This should remove any doubt that the preparations sold as LSD are in fact the real McCoy.<br /><br />II. A HERETICAL VIEWPOINT<br /><br />I intend to advance the heretical viewpoint that there is tremendous variation in the quality of drugs found in blotters, and that few such preparations illicitly available since the mid-1970s even come close to pure LSD-25 in the capacity for expanding consciousness. In the following I first examine the syllogism then move to a discussion of subjective effects and anecdotes about purity.<br /><br />A: An analysis of the Syllogism<br /><br />I now proceed to examine the assumptions and conclusions of the syllogism outlined above<br /><br />1) A blotter can only hold about 200 ug of drug material<br /><br />Not necessarily true. Blotters vary in size, some weighing up to several milligrams in weight, and I have seen blotters that were saturated with added materials. I will examine (2) and (3) together.<br /><br />2) Only the d isomer of LSD is active in such quantity 3) All illicit &#039;acid&#039; packaged in blotter form owes all of its psychoactive effects to LSD-25 and thus any difference in subjective or physical effects are entirely due to difference in dose, set, or setting.<br /><br />Not true. 1: Several other *known* drugs are active in such quantities. Here are a few, listed with typical psychoactive doses: drug dose (ug) ---- ---------LSD 100-1000 nicotine 300 scopolamine 500 atropine 500 carbachol 200 aminopentamide 500 colchicine 100 fentanyl 100 etorphine 100 resperine 250 Some of these drugs are very cheap and easy to obtain, such as socpolamine and atropine. Even methamphetamine is active in doses as low as 1 mg. 2: LSD-25 may potentiate other materials that are normally inactive. Even minute ammounts of amphetamine can significantly potentiate LSD, and change the quality of the effect. The same may be true of other lysergic acid derivatives and by-products in a blotter. 3: All the discussion I have seen about psychoactive by-products and residues in blotters has focused on known such known products as the 4 isomers of LSD, variations on the anide group, known lysergic amines, etc. The information about these chemicals appears to be based on assays of extraction and synthesis products based on high-quality processes using materials and reagents of pharmaceutical quality. What goes on in illicit drug labs may be an entirely different story. Question: What happens when you substitute the hydrogens on any of the various positions of the lysergic backbone with some other element or compound? How do differences in saturation affect its qualities? If the base molecule is LSD it may still have very high potency, but qualitatively very different (eg: muddled) effects. 4: The mechanism by which LSD alters consciousness is not understood. The fact that only 0.001% of a dose crosses the blood-brain barrier, and it leaves the brain within an hour suggests that it&#039;s mechanism of action is very different from most drugs, so generalizations about purity/quality based on other drugs should be used with caution. Perhaps there are phenomena of synchronization, synergy, or resonance in the neural response patterns to LSD that are disrupted or muted by the presence of variants of LSD at LSD receptors (if they exist). We simply don&#039;t know, and to pretend we can speak with certainty about such things is to indulge in hubris.&quot;<br /><br />

				Continued...<br /><br />&quot;B: What lsd.data Proves<br /><br />The analysis results in lsd.data proves that the vast majority of alleged LSD samples analyzed in 1973 and 1974 tested positive for LSD, and did not test positive for whatever other drugs they were testing for. Relevant questions include: How selective were the LSD identification tests used? and How many other drugs were tested for? In any case, based on numerous reports, I believe most of the acid available during those years was of high quality and was similar if not identical to LSD-25. The consistency of quality didn&#039;t start to plummet until the mid-1970s, due in part to restricted availability of chemicals required for synthesis. A recent post (arguing in favor of the Doctrine) is instructive.<br /><br />: &gt; In the 60s, it never seemed that certain charachteristics were assigned to &gt; different batches. Acid was acid. Only when printed blotters really &gt; started taking off in the late 70s (replacing pills, microdots, windowpane, &gt; etc) did people start giving charachteristics to blotter.<br /><br />C: Subjective Evidence Supporting the Heresy<br /><br />There is abundant subjective evidence that since the prohibition of LSD, and particularly since the mid-1970s the illicit psychoactive preparations having effective doses in the sub-milligram range (eg-blotters), called acid or LSD, have baseline effects (independent of dose, set, or setting) which vary over a wide spectrum.<br /><br />This distribution of effects may be highly modal and centralized, with the vast majority of acid available at a given time having very similar effects, perhaps even comming from only a few sources; and this may give users who have only sampled acid for a few years the impression that it&#039;s all the same, and thus little reason to doubt it&#039;s authenticity or quality.<br /><br />However, virtually any connoisseur of acid who has a discerning mind and a good memory, and has sampled illicit offerings for several decades (starting in the 60&#039;s or early 70&#039;s) knows that quality is a very real and important issue. I will leave it to the reader to seek out the opinions of veterans of the the first psychedelic era.<br /><br />D: Weighing Subjective Evidence Against the Gospel<br /><br />The syllogism supporting the Doctrine has gaping holes in it. It, in combination with other supporting evidence, may tend to support the case: [a] Most blotter acid is owes most of its activity to lysergic acid derivaties structurally similar to LSD (and perhaps testing positive for it). But it certainly doesn&#039;t make the case: &nbsp;All blotter acid owes all of its activity to LSD-25, whose pharmacological action is unmodified by impurities.<br /><br />What can one learn from subjective experiences induced by acid? The proponents of the central dogma contend that since the effects of LSD are highly susceptible to set, setting, and dose, users&#039; attributions of differences in effects to differences in the drug are groundless. It is true that variables such as set, setting and dose are extremely influential in determining the subjective effects of LSD. In fact the LSD experience is probably more susceptable to these effects than any other drug known. This does not mean that a discerning user is incapable of separating to a significant or high degree such variables from variations in drug quality. It is very much a function of the aptitude and experience of the user. Some people can readily distinguish the effects of pure mescaline from those of the mixture of alkaloids found in Peyote. Others can&#039;t distinguish between the distinctly different effects of Psilocybin and LSD.<br /><br />To illustrate the capacity for discriminating between drug quality and other variables I offer the following metaphor: Think of LSD as a window through which you look into a different world. Your position relative to the window, and what is on the other side represents set and setting. The clarity of the window represents the quality of the drug. Now your position and the scene outside the window can change dramatically, but reguardless you are still capable of perceiving the clarity of the window. Moreover, if you had never looked through a window before, and you were given a cloudy one to look through and told it was LSD, you would have no reason to doubt its authenticity because you have never had the experience of looking through a clear one.<br /><br />E: Anecdotes<br /><br />The following accounts are presented as evidence that blotters may contain psychoactive substances that produce effects quite different from LSD. Note that these accounts represent extreme and atypical experiences with blotter acid and are presented to refute the Doctrine, not to counter case [a], above.<br /><br />1: aluminized LSD? 1978 (5-point star pattern white paper): I went for a bike ride, and took an aluminum canteen that had water sitting in it for a long time. I put blotter on my tounge and washed it down with the canteen water. Within 30 minutes I started to noticed effects, but not like acid. They were very rough and jolting. There was a violent flashing in my visual field. I got off my bike and went into the woods. I started to get jolting, cramping feelings throughout my nervous system. These very unpleasant physical symptoms completely overshadowed any psychic effects. I was undergoing what seemed to be a convulsive attack, and feared for my life. After several hours, the effects diminished, and I rode home. I called my friend who gave me the hits and he was shocked to hear of my experience, having certified that it was good acid. Having complete trust in him, I came up with the hypothesis that aluminum in the water had reacted with the acid to yield a product with strychnine-like effects. I cautiously sampled another hit. This time it was completely smooth with no physical symptoms. Subsequent trips on the same batch were also smooth with normal acid-like psychic effects.<br /><br />2: tropane acid? 1987 (orange blotters seemingly saturated with material) I have had hundreds of acid trips and one trip on Datura Stranorum (containing tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine). This acid resembled Datura more closely than most other acid I&#039;ve had. It wasn&#039;t very mind-expanding, but was very dreamy, and vision was slightly blurred. The visuals were of the cholinergic type, not the norepinepherin or serotonin type. It had a slightly dissociative effect uncharacteristic of normal acid. There was also a harsh feeling in my heart not unlike one I had on the Datura trip.<br /><br />3: &#039;speedy&#039; acid 1979 (red blotter): I have taken a few different blotters which had effects resembling amphetamine more than LSD. This was particularly true of this dose. The effects were already strong after 45 minutes (instead of the 1 hour wait before the start of the climb characteristic of LSD). The depth, subtleties, colors, highly connected patterns, vivid imagination, and multiplicity and liberty of thought characteristic of LSD were absent. Instead there was an urgent matter-of-fact quality of thought; a feeling of being pushed against my will. Color perception was flattened, dominated by monochromes, especially red. Kinesthetic, tactile, and visual perceptions over time seemed to melt into a kind of blur.<br /><br />III. GUIDEBOOK FOR UNBELIEVERS<br /><br />A: Subjective Indications of Quality<br /><br />The following table is provided as a resource for evaluating the effects of acid. Effects of other drugs are listed for comparison purposes. Scores are normalized for dose, meaning that a given score is expressed as a ratio to the overall effect of the drug. Thus, for example, taking larger doses of scopolamine cannot be used to approximate LSD-like synesthetic experiences, as other effects of the drug, such as delirium, get in the way. Similar dose-related phenomena limit the mind-expanding capacities of most acid.<br /><br />Note: this table is based on extensive but imperfect data, and necessarily involves subjective elements. Readers who disagree with my scoring are encouraged to write me with their opinions, which will all me to improve my data.<br /><br />code drug ---- ----LSD - LSD-25 LAA - crude lysergic amines, from HBWR Mes - mescaline TMA - TMA Amp - methamphetamine Psi - psilocin Sco - scopolamine &amp; atropine acid - various blotter acid 1975-92<br /><br />effect LSD LAA Mes TMA Amp Psi Sco acid ------ --- --- --- --- --- --- --- -----pharmacology: dose (mg) 0.3 8 800 30 3 30 2 &lt; 2 onset (hours) 1.0 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.4 1.5 0.5- 1.0 peak (hours) 3.0 3.5 4.0 3.0 3.0 1.6 3.5 2.0- 3.0 termination (hours) 12 8 15 15 15 6 8 6 - 10 physiological: pupil dilation 7 8 6 5 3 7 9 5 - 9 nausea 1 8 2 2 3 4 0 1 - 8 increased heart rate 2 2 3 4 6 2 4 2 - 7 perceptual: transparency of hallucinations 8 6 5 4 3 4 2 2 - 5 information content of hallucinations 9 9 6 7 2 3 1 1 - 5 symmetry of hallucinations 6 6 9 6 2 4 0 1 - 5 detail of hallucinations 9 3 7 6 1 3 1 0 - 6 sequential afterimages or &#039;trails&#039; 7 4 8 4 2 4 1 1 - 7 color enhancement 6 2 9 5 1 7 0 0 - 5 Synesthesia 9 4 7 5 2 4 1 1 - 5 cognitive: concentration 7 4 9 5 2 3 0 -3 - 4 association 8 2 7 3 2 5 2 1 - 5 task impairment 2 5 3 2 1 5 9 4 - 9 memory of experience 6 7 9 8 4 6 -5 -2 - 4 subjective: expansiveness 8 2 9 5 1 4 1 1 - 5 time dilation 8 2 5 4 4 6 0 2 - 6 exaggeration, caricature 9 3 5 3 2 7 0 1 - 6 emotive content of hallucinations 5 5 4 3 2 7 8 1 - 4 imagination/fantasy 9 3 7 3 1 5 6 1 - 5 recollective: long-term memory accessibility 9 3 5 3 2 2 -1 -1 - 3 access to subconscious 9 3 6 4 1 3 2 0 - 3 self-perception: ego dissolution 9 6 6 4 1 5 1 2 - 8 out-of-body experience 7 6 5 4 2 5 8 2 - 8 side-effects: post-experience lethargy 0 2 -2 0 3 3 4 0 - 5 residual headaches 0 0 0 0 0 2 5 0 - 6<br /><br />B: Precautions<br /><br />Beware of blotters which have a bitter tast or appear to be stained with color. LSD is tasteless and colorless. When first sampling acid from a batch of unknown quality, take a fraction of a dosage unit to ascertain the quality and strength of effects. Pay attention to the onset, and duration of effects, and to side effects. If the experience is smooth, free of noticable side effects, and matches the profile of LSD reasonably well, consider doubling the dosage next time (after at least 3 days have elapsed).<br /><br />C: Storage<br /><br />Oxygen, UV light, and moisture degrade LSD, and the rate of most reactions increases at least with the square of the absolute temperature. Therefore it should be kept tightly wrapped in cellophane (crinkly) plastic (not polyethylene or aluminum, which may react with it), and, if feasible, refrigerated. It may also help to sprinkle some ascorbic acid crystals (vitamin C) in the package to act as an oxygen scavenger.<br /><br />III. THE GOSPEL AND THE POLITICS OF LSD<br /><br />The proponents of the Gospel seem to be motivated by a desire to dispell fears about the quality and adulteration of acid which discourage experimentation. Quoting from the FAQ:<br /><br />&gt; (It is common for the uninformed to harbor fears (e.g., about adulterants) &gt; instilled by ignorance and the current hysteria/propoganda. That&#039;s why this &gt; FAQ exists.)<br /><br />It goes to some length to (correctly) dispell the myth of strychnine adulteration. However it does not credibly address the possibility of other adulterants or the possibility of the presence of LSD-analogs which could greatly alter the effect.<br /><br />I do not question the sincerity or motives of those who promulgate the Doctrine; only their uncritical and dogmatic adherence to an apparently logical conclusion. I believe that while attempting to counteract the mis-understanding and mis-information, about psychedelic drugs endemic to our culture, they are unwittingly doing a great dis-service in contending that most acid is indistinguishable from perfect LSD. As an entire generation accepts the conventional wisdom that the often mediocre psychedelic preparations called acid are one and the same with LSD, the memory of the most mind-expanding and liberating drug ever discovered is being buried.&quot;<br /><br />

				Awesome article. I wonder how a hit of blotter paper holds 1500 mics of NBOMe or molecules with a similar potency. The article says 200 mics is the maximum absorption. Maybe the paper comes in different densities or thickness. Maybe some molecules are more compacted and the paper will hold greater amounts. I think that everybody who has dosed with different batches of LSD would agree that quality definitely varies.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: anothergirl</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">was. Like, oh yeah, that&#039;s what I use for my job, so... oh yeah! I&#039;m that person who does this boring shit for a living; I&#039;m not actually some Kung Fu master out to avenge my father&#039;s death!<br /><br />This entire mini-ego-death probably only lasted 10 seconds, and of course the anger became laughter again, which by the way at one during my trip caused me to fall down on the floor with my sides cramping up really bad because I was laughing so hard. Good times!<br /><br />The rest is a haze of weird thoughts and just wandering around the house, but one of the more ridiculous thoughts I can remember was that either always had been or had now somehow turned myself into this meat-bag processing device for damned souls to be tormented in, and I was now doomed to live through every unpleasant thought or situation possible from now until I died. Kinda like the Folding@ thing for protein folding for cancer cures, except that Hell was using my brain cycles to process every conceivable torment that could ever exist, one by one, as a way to punish the damned souls, and there was nothing I could do about it.<br /><br />And what if I&#039;m right?<br /><br />What if I have to sit here until I die thinking about or living through every horrible thing that could ever be thought of or experienced?<br /><br />Well, thankfully this batshit line of thinking eventually ended when I got distracted by a bag of chips.<br /><br />It&#039;s worth pointing out that this backwards place I live in doesn’t have central heating, and that combined with the LSD-induced severe hypothermia had me in my ski mask, so in order to eat the chips I had to pull the mask up, temporarily blinding myself.<br /><br />Did somebody say perfect recipe for popping my CEV cherry?<br /><br />Next thing I knew I was witnessing this Milkdroppy fractal factory or some shit that was synced with the sound and rhythm of the crunching chips that I couldn&#039;t stop shoving down my gullet. I was in the God Damned Dimension of the Fractal Chip-Crunching Factory!<br /><br />And once the chips were gone (and oh I just know they&#039;ve made their way straight to my thighs by now boys!), it was time to pull my mask back down.<br /><br />Then I realized I didn&#039;t know what room I was in. So I thought I&#039;d bet myself if I could get it right if I thought for a minute--mentally retraced my steps and shit. So come on, calm down and remember what room you&#039;re in, then pull down the mask and see if you&#039;re right! Fabulous prizes and more will be yours!<br /><br />Bad idea!<br /><br />Now I&#039;m second-guessing whether I&#039;m even in my house at all!<br /><br />What if I&#039;ve actually gone outside in another Coma like the one with the movie, and I&#039;m really in the fucking convenience store, and there’s people and cops standing right there watching me, and in this country you&#039;re as fucked for being high as you are for being in actual possession, which doesn&#039;t fucking matter because walk into my house and I am in fucking possession! And maybe I didn&#039;t pay for the chips either (but as Ricky would say, you can&#039;t go to jail for &quot;theft under a thousand&quot;, heh).<br /><br />So after 10 seconds or so of contemplating this horrific prospect and preparing to reveal my true unmasked identity to a throng of horrified onlookers and cops and prosecutors and the clerk demanding the cash for the chips I just stole, I convinced myself that there&#039;s no way I&#039;m anywhere but my house, so just pull up your damn mask and get on with it you dummy...<br /><br />Anyway there&#039;s some other crazy inside-out CEV shit I&#039;m not even a good enough writer to describe, and even if I could it&#039;s like a good joke--doesn&#039;t work if you have to explain it. And I&#039;ve been up for like 30 hours at this point so that&#039;s probably good enough for my report. And I hope I get a good grade &#039;cause I promise I read the whole fucking book!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You would be fun to trip with.

				OK figured I&#039;ll post some feedback/trip report on Typtonite&#039;s WoW LSD.<br /><br />It took a few days for trypt to send the order, but he messaged me and let me know what was going on, which most vendors wouldn&#039;t do. It seems like he really values his customers. All in all, it took 6 days from ordered to received, which is still very fast compared to what I&#039;m used to.<br /><br />The packaging was TOP NOTCH. Some of the best I&#039;ve seen. It made me laugh a little and all I&#039;ll say is that I don&#039;t think a postal inspector would EVER suspect the parcel.<br /><br />Ok on to the trip report:<br /><br />Tolerance: I haven&#039;t done LSD in 3 years but I have been doing 25c and 25i recently. About once a week. Tripped on 25i about a week and a half before dosing the cid.<br /><br />My girl and I dropped 2 hits as soon as I received. No bitter taste or anything. After about 30 mins I decided to go to the mall. I was starting to feel floaty and slight visuals as we pulled into the mall. All the people Christmas shopping were freaking me out so we just got some ice cream and left. By the time we got home it had been about 1 1/2 hours since I dropped and I still wasn&#039;t feeling too much, so I figured it might not be too strong, so I dropped another. Turns out too be stronger than I suspected. Seems like as soon as I swallowed the 3rd hit, the first 2 hit me full force. Wasn&#039;t SUPER strong but I was having great spiritual feelings, very nice visuals, and everything seemed so magical. After that, me and my girl decided to go to the beach and chill for a few minutes, but ended up stuck there for a few hours. The visuals were AWESOME. The 3rd hit seemed to hit me at the beach and we wandered around for hours, soaking in all the good vibes from the ocean. We watched a beautiful full color spectrum sunset over the ocean that was just unexplainable. After we left the beach, I started to develop a headache, which really sucks. However, I don&#039;t think it had anything to do with the LSD. I just seem to get headaches often, about once a week. This was a very inopportune time to get a headache and it kinda made my trip less enjoyable. Anyway, I still had a decent time at home watching TV and hanging with my girl. By the way, she reported not feeling too much, BUT she did 25c the night before. I had told her not to but oh well. My headache seemed to ease a bit as I relaxed, and I had a nice smooth comedown and was able to sleep fine when it wore off. Trip lasted about 12 hours total.<br /><br />Conclusion: Acid was not as strong as I thought it would be. One thing I noticed was I didn&#039;t have many giggle fits, which I thought was kinda odd, but heavy visuals and dreamlike head space. I don&#039;t know much about microgram dosage, because acid has always just been sold to me as acid. I have no reason not to believe that they are not 90-95 ug as advertised. No&nbsp; where near the strongest LSD I&#039;ve done, but also not the weakest. I would say they don&#039;t seem worth more than $10 ea, but I am willing to pay the extra $30 for the great service. Also, LSD is very hard to find where I&#039;m at.<br /><br />SATISFIED

				Today I took the leap and risked tripping outisde. Went ahead and stayed conservative with the dose, dropping 2.5 of 3Jane&#039;s 90mcg tabs--even though at home that does nothing for me--on my way to the aquarium. Turned out to be about right.<br /><br />On a whim I took a few of my favorite albums, layered in some bubbly sfx and applied a subtle underwater reverb effect and listened to music while going through the whole thing 3 times.<br /><br />As I had suspected, the giant spider crabs were scary as fuck, but other than that it was pretty cool. Nice and dark so it helped with the paranoia.

It`s handled by a brotherhood of people who truly believe there doing the work of god(or whatever name you call creation). We believe that LSD crystal has to be handled by the right people who are totally committed to the movement. <br />When we moved crystal there was always the feeling that we were protected by a higher power. I can`t tell you how many times i have had crystal or acid on me or my brothers and have been in situation`s where we should have gotten busted and something always protected us. So many times that coincidence is not an option. Why do i think we were protected. Because the family does it for mankind not money. We viewed LSD as the only hope for the radical change in conciousness that would save us. So in effect we viewed are work as the work of God. You know why they never busted a family lab? Because we would never betray LSD. Just as Jesus was nailed to the cross we were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail or die to protect what we viewed as the salvation of are species. Sound`s a little dramatic doesn`t it, but i`m trying to give you an understanding of the faith in LSD that the family has. <br /><br />By the way the Kansas bust was not a family lab incase anybody is wondering. The point i`m trying to make is the family believes LSD has to move through the right hands. This is why you can`t go down to the corner and get a gram of crystal. sorry to ramble. <br /><br />As some of the cooks retire i rest assure you that they pass there recipes and secret`s down to those chosen to continue to fight the good fight. I don`t think it will ever be as readily available all over the country as it once was due to the break up of the distribution cycle of tour. I could be wrong and hope i am. <br /><br />Alot of old family have moved on and including myself retired, feeling we served our time. The family does hear your cry`s for more acid and they don`t plan on giving up on mankind. Now&#039;s a good time for labs to be inactive. the current government administration is viewed as a bad storm that needs to pass as jerry sang &quot;all good things in all good time&quot; Keep the faith&quot;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Only about this far into reading back over it and I&#039;m already getting emotional.&nbsp; If the world *ever* needed it, it&#039;s now.

But the information I&#039;ve been able to find is contradictory and it tends to lean toward weight not having much of an effect.<br /><br />However, it would seem that some people require higher doses to get the same effect regardless of body weight, so apparently you could have a skinny guy tripping less off the same dose as a fat guy and you just have to learn what works for you.<br /><br />My personal theory is that bigger and smarter brains require more, because I have a much higher threshold than my friends :p<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>that woman in your avatar, whoever it is, is the most beautiful woman i have ever laid my eyes upon

				Ok, after reading what follows these two sentences, this next one will make sense. Mr. Spokesperson, I move that we have a new category that is beyond the BAD vendors that we will just call the WORST vendors. ;-D The effing audacity this guy has. (And sorry to beat a dead horse, but if someone was still holding onto faith for an order from him, consider the fat lady&#039;s voice hoarse.<br /><br />GetYourFix(78) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you plan on making things right or not? Hell, I will ship the 40 or so drops back to wherever the fuck they came from. I mean you want to hit on everyone being refunded and good communication on the majority of your feedback. I&#039;m the person who has had your back and let you trample all over my good name. I didn&#039;t have to make you look bad. You did that by all the shady things you did. Now, you refuse to refund my 150 that I gave you to open your account. Just know that if you don&#039;t want to make things whole, I&#039;m more than happy to send my friends at vendor support a message about your behavior and see how long your account lasts. Anyhow, I&#039;m not trying to be a dick, never wanted to be, but unfortunately, that&#039;s apparently what you want out of this. Make my transaction whole sooner than later, or I will take it up with vendor support. It&#039;s not that I&#039;m in need of the coins. I&#039;d be even more happy with what I was supposed to receive to begin with. You want to throw your hurtful words around, yet you can&#039;t type a sentence to tell me what it is I was ingesting besides low grade crystal that was clearly nowhere near 93%. Hell, I&#039;d be shocked if that crystal is stronger than 60%. Absolutely shocked. I see you were online today, so I will give you 24 hours to get back to me. Remember, feedback can always change. Almost as easily as it can be left the same. Don&#039;t think I&#039;m blackmailing you for feedback by any stretch. You will get what&#039;s owed to you as far as that goes. I just think it&#039;s very unprofessional to make sure everyone is taken care of except me. I mean, I honestly thought that you were legit and would be a longterm vendor here. The hours I&#039;ve spent having to defend myself because people thought I was your reshipper would blow your mind. There are still people who don&#039;t believe me. If you can&#039;t see where that&#039;s fucked up, no one can. <br /><br />Jimmy Buffett(90) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I planned on refunding you first before everyone but frankly I dont appreciate the way you handled this at all...<br /><br />Happy Holidays<br /><br />Jimmy B<br /><br />GetYourFix(78) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in what way, Jimmy? You are a piece of work.<br /><br />GetYourFix(78) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#039;t even begin to make you look bad until you send me that rude ass message.This is ridiculous. Keep the fucking coins and keep your bullshit &quot;acid&quot;. I would flush it down the toilet, but I care about the water cycle too much to do that. There ya go, buddy. YOU WIN!!! This is beyond childish. It&#039;s my own damn fault though, so don&#039;t think I&#039;m angry at you. I should have caught myself being too generous as people tend to take advantage of an abundance of kindness. Think about it dude, I waited a WEEK before you actually (or whoever) sent it. I thought it was out, and for whatever reason was just about the very LAST one to receive from when shipped with everyone else&#039;s, so I was patient for an extra two weeks longer than second to last person to receive in the same drop. SR would have suspended your vendor account if you continued with your bullshit like you did with everyone else for the same amount of time I was reassuring everyone it would be ok.You enjoy your chump change and be on your way, sir. No one seems to care for the way that you conduct yourself here other than your other personalities that log in to the forums to give you some support. And yes, this is gonna be copy/pasted in the forums before you have a chance to read it all.<br /><br />Happy fucking holidays to you as well,<br /><br />GYF<br /><br />You have some fucking audacity, friend. Please just cease communications. I had almost forgot about all of it. Why not just take your 1 of 5 and ignore me like you&#039;re so good at doing. Something that sums this up more than anything is that you can&#039;t even give me (at the very least) an apology back. I mean one would think that someone in your position would have the word,&quot;sorry,&quot; stuck in his damn head. Take care of yourself. Maybe you will treat people differently if you can manage to order some from a vendor here without them finding out it&#039;s you. Like I had said, we&#039;re done talking about this. Your messages will simply be deleted if sent. If you can&#039;t tell by now, I can take the asshole thing above and beyond if that&#039;s what you want. Which it probably was seeing the effort you put into it ;-D<br /><br />P.s. Fuck off.<br /><br />

				Ok guys, been a little too quiet around this here corner of the forums, I know ive been very absent in this thread, and for this I offer my apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;How about some light reading??<br /><br />&quot;LSD from the Black Market<br />Nonmedicinal LSD consumption can bring dangers of an entirely different type than<br />hitherto discussed: for most of the LSD offered in the drug scene is of unknown origin.<br />LSD preparations from the black market are unreliable when it comes to both quality and<br />dosage. They rarely contain the declared quantity, but mostly have less LSD, often none<br />at all, and sometimes even too much. In many cases other drugs or even poisonous<br />substances are sold as LSD. These observations were made in our laboratory upon<br />analysis of a great number of LSD samples from the black market. They coincide with<br />the experiences of national drug control departments.<br />The unreliability in the strength of LSD preparations on the illicit drug market can lead<br />to dangerous overdosage. Overdoses have often proved to be the cause of failed LSD<br />experiments that led to severe psychic and physical breakdowns. Reports of alleged fatal<br />LSD poisoning, however, have yet to be confirmed. Close scrutiny of such cases<br />invariably established other causative factors.<br />The following case, which took place in 1970, is cited as an example of the possible<br />dangers of black market LSD. We received for investigation from the police a drug<br />powder distributed as LSD. It came from a young man who was admitted to the hospital<br />in critical condition and whose friend had also ingested this preparation and died as a<br />result. Analysis showed that the powder contained no LSD, but rather the very poisonous<br />alkaloid strychnine.<br />If most black market LSD preparations contained less than the stated quantity and<br />often no LSD at all, the reason is either deliberate falsification or the great instability of<br />this substance. LSD is very sensitive to air and light. It is oxidatively destroyed by the<br />oxygen in the air and is transformed into an inactive substance under the influence of<br />light. This must be taken into account during the synthesis and especially during the<br />production of stable, storable forms of LSD. Claims that LSD may easily be prepared, or<br />that every chemistry student in a half-decent laboratory is capable of producing it, are<br />untrue. Procedures for synthesis of LSD have indeed been published and are accessible to<br />everyone. With these detailed procedures in hand, chemists would be able to carry out the<br />synthesis, provided they had pure lysergic acid at their disposal; its possession today,<br />however, is subject to the same strict regulations as LSD. In order to isolate LSD in pure<br />crystalline form from the reaction solution and in order to produce stable preparations,<br />however, special equipment and not easily acquired specific experience are required,<br />owing (as stated previously) to the great instability of this substance.<br />Only in completely oxygen-free ampoules protected from light is LSD absolutely<br />stable. Such ampoules, containi ng 100 μg (= 0.1 mg) LSD-tartrate (tartaric acid salt of<br />LSD) in 1 cc of aqueous solution, were produced for biological research and medicinal<br />use by the Sandoz firm. LSD in tablets prepared with additives that inhibit oxidation,<br />while not absolutely stable, at least keeps for a longer time. But LSD preparations often<br />found on the black market-LSD that has been applied in solution onto sugar cubes or<br />blotting paper-decompose in the course of weeks or a few months.<br />With such a highly potent substance as LSD, the correct dosage is of paramount<br />importance. Here the tenet of Paracelsus holds good: the dose determines whether a<br />substance acts as a remedy or as a poison. A controlled dosage, however, is not possible<br />with preparations from the black market, whose active strength is in no way guaranteed.<br />One of the greatest dangers of non-medicinal LSD experiments lies, therefore, in the use<br />of such preparations of unknown provenience.&quot;

				From LSD: Cleanliness Is Next To Godliness by Bruce Eisner in 1977<br />Originally Published in High Times<br /><br />In the late 1940s, psychologists began experimenting with LSD as a &quot;psychotomimetic&quot; drug - one that causes the taker temporarily to mime the condition of psychosis. Some experimental subjects, however, and eventually some modern mystics like Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, and Alan Watts discovered in LSD a shortcut to the ecstasy and egolessness of nirvana. LSD was recognized as the switch that turned on the clear light of the void.<br /><br />Today&#039;s acid trip, however, is far more likely to resemble a live TV broadcast in runny color from the from seat of a roller coaster or a scene from The Exorcist. The decline in psychedelic quality over the years, which resembles the degeneration of Christianity and Russian Communism, has been a consequence of greed and opportunism on the part of manufactures and distributors. They offer to substitute immediate sensory gratifications for the original spiritual ideals. But the history of underground chemistry is also one of ingenuity and courage though influenced by haste and amateurishness. Its is the story of how LSD-25, the most powerful and spiritual molecule known to humanity became a &quot;street drug.&quot; <br /><br />Originally all LSD was made by Sandoz Pharmaceutical company, which had developed the chemical and hoped to market it commercially. It came in glass ampules filled with blue liquid, or small tablets in bottles with pharmaceutical labels specifying strength.<br /><br />With underground LSD use came underground manufacture. The first recorded underground laboratory was set up by Bernard Roseman in 1962. Roseman, who now lives in seclusion in Oregon, was later arrested for allegedly attempting to smuggle 62,000 doses of LSD. In his LSD and the Age of the Mind, he has this account of the first manufacture of LSD of less than pharmaceutical quality:<br /><br />&quot;I have already invested a year - on and off - and all the money I could save on this project, and I was at the point of admitting defeat. At this time, I was naturally reading everything I could lay my hands upon about ergot alkaloids. I stumbled upon a few articles that at first seemed quite unrelated to LSD, but they were logical and worth a try; because by comparison the process was exceedingly simple, compared to Hofmann&#039;s monumental preparation.<br /><br />I obtained new starting material and worked it up to the point I was sure was correct, where I had d-lysergic acid monohydrate, quite useless by itself but the prerequisite for making LSD-25 by any system. The rest of my ordered materials arrived and I was ready to proceed. After so many repeated failures, I couldn&#039;t accept the possibility that this few-day procedure would work. <br /><br />I went ahead nevertheless, though pessimistically, so that my seemingly apparent failure would not bother me too much. I worked with extreme care, protecting anything from heat and light. At the last step, when I was recrystallizing the few grams I had obtained, I was filtering the crystals off by vacuum and using ether. When all the ether evaporated , the substance started to absorb moisture from the atmosphere and was turning black before my eyes. All my work was gone: I stood there shocked unable to move for a moment. My hands instinctively grabbed an alcohol bottle and I pored it over the black decomposed material hoping to salvage something. I separated it with water and disheartedly took the black mess home. All night I tossed and turned and dreamt horrible, unrelated dreams. <br /><br />At the first crack of dawn, I jumped out of bed, grabbed the flask from the refrigerator, poured a teaspoonful and drank it down. I went back to bed and turned on Wagner&#039;s Parsifal. Minutes passed by and nothing seemed to happen. I had psychologically prepared myself for failure, so I just closed my eyes and lay back an listened to the wonderful sounds of Wagner. In my concentration, I failed to notice that the music was getting slowly louder and instead of just my ears hearing, all my senses seemed to encompass the sound., and instead of hearing the music - I was the music!<br /><br />Beautiful, soft colors emerged and exploded as climates of tone were achieved. An immediate understanding of the composer&#039;s intentions was revealed to me; I was being taken on a heavenly excursion into the world of pure sound and emotion. All at once, I sprang up with joy. I was in the state of LSD - my own LSD which I had made. I was deliriously happy and proud of my success.&quot;<br /><br />LSD is a translucent crystal; this was a black mess. Thus, the first underground LSD was also the first impure batch, and its distribution may, somewhere, have incurred the first unfavorable consumer reaction.<br /><br />By 1965, use had increased sharply. Most acid at this time came in sugar cubes dropped with liquid Sandoz or some type of underground LSD. What percentage of the material was Sandoz is left to future determination. Augustus Stanley Owsley III, unable to obtain any pharmaceutical LSD, began to manufacture his own - first in Los Angeles in &#039;65, then in nearby Point Richmond in &#039;66. <br /><br />Owsley&#039;s fellow alchemist, Tim Scully, admitted to me that the 1965 batch was impure, but claims that Owsley and he perfected a purification process in 1966. Many who used both Sandoz and Owsley - the latter came in tablets of purple (Purple Haze) and white (White Lightning) of 270 micrograms - say that Owsley acid was less mystical and had more stimulant side reactions than the Sandoz product.<br /><br />Timothy Leary, who realized that impurities were a threat to the spreading psychedelic revolution, uttered prophetic words of warning at a Senate committee hearing in 1966, in exchange with Teddy Kennedy:<br /><br />Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts: &quot;What is it in the quality that you are frightened about?&quot;<br /><br />Dr. Leary: &quot;We do not want amateur or black-market sale or distribution of LSD.&quot;<br /><br />Senator Kennedy: &quot;Why not?&quot;<br /><br />Dr. Leary: &quot;Or the barbiturates or liquor. When you buy a bottle of liquor-&quot;<br /><br />Senator Kennedy: &quot;This is not responsive. As to LSD, why do you not want it?&quot;<br /><br />Dr. Leary: &quot;On possession?&quot;<br /><br />Senator Kennedy: &quot;Why do you not want the indiscriminate manufacture and distribution? Is it because it is dangerous?&quot;<br /><br />Dr. Leary: &quot;Because you do not know what you are getting...&quot;<br /><br />Despite Leary&#039;s warning, LSD was made illegal on October 16, 1966.<br /><br />Owsley acid was the first large-scale commercialization of LSD. There were other smaller LSD laboratories before Owsley, and there were scores of laboratories that put out LSD at the same time that Owsley did. Some were making LSD of a purer form; the majority made it much worse.<br /><br />After Owsley was arrested in 1967 at his tabbing facility at Orinda, California, his protege Scully set up a laboratory with Nicholas Sand, another alchemist long involved in the psychedelic scene. They manufactured a quantity of ALD-52 - a cousin to LSD, which they called Sunshine - in large crumbly orange tablets of 270 micrograms or so. [Erowid Note: Though it was claimed at the time that they were producing ALD-52, we now believe that they were, in fact, producing LSD.]<br /><br />In the spring of 1969, Ron Stark, then a chemist with a European LSD factory and now a fugitive, allegedly began supplying underground acid to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. Since the Brotherhood was also, by this time, distributing ALD-52, and since both drugs were tabbed into identical pills (except for a few early blue tablets of ALD-52), many people didn&#039;t realize that there was more than one kind of Sunshine. Many counterfeit versions soon appeared on the market, most of which were impure, according to Scully.<br /><br />Sand and Scully ceased manufacturing, but Stark went on to produce over 10 kilograms (over 35 million doses in crystal form) of what became the famous Orange Sunshine - the last of which actually appeared in large red and green tablets called &quot;Christmas Acid.&quot;<br /><br />With the Sunshine boom came increased reports of side effects. In addition to stimulant reactions and symptoms akin to those of strychnine poisoning being reported, there seemed to be something missing in the spiritual dimensions of this new underground acid. Michael Hollinshead, who gave Leary his first taste of acid in 1960, later wrote in The Man Who Turned on the World:<br /><br />There was now (1968) little good acid around, and what there was - the so-called &quot;street acid&quot; - came mainly from California. There was something wrong with the synthesis; it was not pure. And you were never sure what it was exactly that you were taking, so I only dropped it on those rare occasions when someone gave me &quot;Sandoz&quot; or &quot;crystal&quot; acid...<br /><br />My evaluation had nothing to do with the notion that a wholly synthetic drug produced a wholly synthetic experience - the intellectual response - but was based on direct, first-hand experience (about 30 trips with street acid in all). And in each session I felt that there was something it lacked - it was too &quot;electric,&quot; too &quot;speedy&quot; and too &quot;mind-shattering.&quot; The earlier clarity of &quot;insight&quot; which I had obtained via the Sandoz acid was replaced by confusion, brokenness, words and worlds thrown into absolute dismemberment, or even absolute chaos, though, I must add, often coupled with a feeling that I can only describe as &quot;sublime inflation,&quot; a super abundance of emotive energy, but it could not signify more a passionate flame and less the life-giving sun.<br /><br />At Woodstock, Hugh Romney (a/k/a &quot;Wavy Gravy&quot;) of the Hog Farm announced to the crowd, &quot;There&#039;s no such thing as bad acid, just acid that&#039;s made wrong.&quot; In 1969, LSD began to appear in microdots, and in 1971, on gelatin sheets of various shapes - dubbed &quot;windowpane.&quot; The strength of individual doses swiftly decreased, and so did the purity of the average street dose.<br /><br />In a correspondence with City magazine in July 1975, Timothy Leary wrote: &quot;After 1966, my lectures and writings were mainly concerned with a general theory of psychological and political relativity and made little mention of lysergic acid, which in truth, had been driven completely off the scene by Owsley speed, orange amphetamine, and the more commercially and socially acceptable cocaine-heroin trade.&quot;<br /><br />In Timothy Leary at Folsom Prison, a filmed dialog made for television but never broadcast, he amplifies: &quot;I don&#039;t particularly recommend you take LSD. First of all, 99 percent of what they say about it isn&#039;t true.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken Kesey also had occasion to reflect back on the acid scene in his recent book Garage Sale: &quot;I can&#039;t really recommend acid, because acid has become an almost meaningless chemical. I mean, the first acid I took was Sandoz, given me by the federal government in a series of experiments (what now, Uncle? Don&#039;t give me that anti-American drug field bullshit: you turned me on ...!) and it was beautiful.<br /><br />&quot;With perhaps the exception of Owsley&#039;s work, every bootleg batch I&#039;ve tried from then on down has been interesting, enlightening, agonizing, bizarre, etc., but never anything as pure.&quot;<br /><br />Many other early trippers, including Alan Harrington (author of Psychopaths), Dr. Stanley Krippner (former head of Brooklyn&#039;s Maimonides Hospital Dream Lab) and Adam Smith (author of Powers of Mind in addition to his Wall Street best sellers), have also noted the decline in psychedelic use and linked it with the purity crisis.<br /><br />An LSD experience is a complex interaction of five influential factors: set, setting, guide (fellow tripper), purity, and dosage level.<br /><br />Set refers to the psychological makeup of the LSD tripper, both long term (genetic inheritance and childhood conditioning) and short term (expectations about the LSD experience and how the person feels that morning).<br /><br />Setting refers to the environment of the trip - indoors or outdoors, &quot;informal suburban house,&quot; &quot;formal hospital room,&quot; or &quot;windy beach at sunrise.&quot;<br /><br />Set, setting and guide form the fabric of the trip. But before these influences can come into play, alteration in consciousness must occur. Thus, the nature of the biochemical used, its purity and its dosage level are most central in determining the course the session will take.

				In its pure form, LSD (d-lysergic acid diethyl amide) is an odorless, colorless, and either tart-tasting (if in the tartrate form) or tasteless crystal substance. The major pharmaceutical company manufacturing pure LSD, for research purposes, is the Spofa United Pharmaceutical Works in Prague, Czechoslovakia, although it has been manufactured by many others. Besides Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company in Switzerland, there was the Eli Lilly &amp; Company with the patent for the Garbrecht process (the most efficient process for the manufacture of LSD), and Farmitillia of Milan, Italy, which perfected the deep-vat cultivation of ergot, a mold that grows on rye, among other places, and serves as a source for lysergic acid monohydrate, the main precursor of LSD. In addition, a number of U.S. pharmaceutical firms make small amount of LSD for testing purposes.<br /><br />Today, underground acid comes in many forms; in tablets of varying sizes and colors, in capsules (most popular from 1966 to 1968), as gelatin windowpane (a lamentable hardship to vegetarians, who do not eat cow hooves from which the gelatin is derived), plastic film, blotter paper, liquid vials, and many other forms - just about anything on which a liquid can be dripped has been used. Since LSD is a crystal and the average dose is so small as to be just barely visible, it is usually dissolved in a solvent such as ethyl alcohol and then dropped on some medium buffered with some inert substance. Only if a buffering substance is inert will it not affect the course of action of the biochemical mind-changer.<br /><br />The most common explanation regarding impurities seems to be adulteration with some other biochemical mind-changer such as speed (amphetamine) or strychnine additives. Yet, as most testing programs and drug information organizations are fond of repeating, there is rarely speed or strychnine in street acid. The most common additive is PCP (phencyclidine, or Serylan, an animal tranquilizer that causes hallucinogenic delirium reactions), which is also present when street acid is mislabeled &quot;mescaline&quot; or &quot;psilocybin.&quot; Synthetic mescaline and psilocybin (usually psilocyn) disappeared from the streets a bit after pure LSD did (around 1969), and the only genuine forms of these drugs on the streets now are the organic staples of mushrooms or buttons of peyote. (Note: The acid-PCP combination is sometimes used on store-bought mushrooms, so caution is advised.)<br /><br />Because of the imprecise nature of the street-drug market, a number of street drug-testing programs were established in the 1970s. These drug organizations have repeatedly labeled most street samples of underground acid as &quot;LSD.&quot; For example, the Straight Dope Newsletter, a compilation of information from U. S. testing organizations, reported on a total of 209 samples turned in to the various organizations during the period from March 1973 thru July 1973, of which 183 samples were &quot;LSD.&quot;<br /><br />PharmChem of Palo Alto, California, the most noted of the various street drug testing groups, reported in 1973: &quot;Of 405 samples said to be LSD, 91.6 percent were as alleged, 3.4 percent had no drug at all, 3 percent were actually DOM, PCP and others, and 2 percent had DOM, PCP and methamphetamine in addition to LSD.&quot;<br /><br />Contrast these two reports to a survey abstracted in LSD - A Total Study (edited by D. V. Siva Sankar): &quot;Marshman and Gibbons tested 519 samples of street drugs for which the vendor&#039;s claimed composition was available. Of the samples alleged to be LSD, 44 percent contained LSD with two or more contaminants or even were mixtures of intermediate chemicals resulting from the failed attempts to synthesize LSD.&quot;<br /><br />There is something wrong, something impure about today&#039;s &quot;street acid.&quot; One possible theory for the degeneration of LSD manufacture is given by Hollingshead in The Man Who Turned on the World:<br /><br />I think the problem for the underground chemists manufacturing clandestine acid was a shortage of ergot, without which the synthesis of d-LSD-25 is impossible. Until 1965, supplies of ergot could be bought with little difficulty from three or four European chemical companies; but pressure from Washington put a stop to this, doubtlessly hopeful that this would lead to an end of clandestine LSD. In one sense, the Federal authorities were right. The underground ceased turning out d-LSD-25; instead, they discovered a wholly synthetic substance akin to d-LSD-25....Sure the new stuff &quot;worked&quot; in the sense that any new mind-altering chemical &quot;works&quot; to produce subjective effects within the body, but it didn&#039;t seem to produce in those who used it any particular noticeable elevation in either head or heart; at least it was - and probably is - an unpopular view amongst the &quot;congnoscenti&quot; who claim that some of the street acid is capable of producing positive subjective effects of a &quot;long-lasting nature,&quot; though they readily admit a lot of the stuff sold as &quot;pure acid&quot; is actually methamphetamine (a potent form of amphetamine first developed by the U.S. Army) or a stripped-down ergotamine compound by modern molecular chemistry.<br /><br />A more likely reason for the different effects of street acid and LSD is that by-product impurities contaminate the product at various points in manufacture. LSD can be made from lysergic acid derived from either morning-glory seeds or ergot, or from compounds made from ergot - including ergotamine tartrate, a pharmaceutical drug used in treating migraine headaches. LSD can also be synthesized totally from organic chemicals. No matter what process is used, if it is carried forth correctly, the resultant molecule is LSD.<br /><br />Before LSD was made illegal, the materials for its manufacture could be purchased from a number of chemical companies in the United States and Europe. Most Owsley acid was manufactured from lysergic acid monohydrate obtained from Sandoz before lysergic acid was proscribed. But after 1966, properly prepared precursors were not easily obtainable.<br /><br />The manufacturing of he necessary precursors is a long process, and a great many new occasions for impurities can arise. During the preparation of the main precursor - lysergic acid monohydrate - various ergot alkaloids and cycloalkamides of lysergic acid will contaminate the final product if not later removed by proper chromatographic procedures. Which contaminants do appear depends on whether the starting material was ergot, ergotamine tartate or morning-glory seeds. And once these proper precursors have been synthesized into LSD, various isomers and lumi-LSD (LSD saturated with water) may contaminate the final product if not removed by proper chromatographic procedures.<br /><br />Thus, chromatography, the highly refined procedure that the organic chemist uses to isolate specific chemicals, is the key process by which impurities may or may not be removed from he eventual LSD crystal.<br /><br />A passage from Psychedelic Chemistry, by Michael Valentine Smith:<br /><br />There is a great deal of superstition regarding purification of psychedelics. Actually, any impurities which may be present as a result of synthetic procedures will almost certainly be without any effect on the trip.<br /><br />If there are 200 micrograms of impurities present... and few compounds will produce a significant effect until a hundred to a thousand times this amount has been ingested. Even mescaline, which has a rather specific psychedelic effect, requires about a thousand times this amount.<br /><br />Most of the books on the market that give details on the LSD process - for example, Psychedelic Guide to the Preparation of the Eucharist, by Robert Brown, Basic Drug Manufacturing and The Book of Acid, by Adam Gottlieb, as well as Michael Valentine Smith&#039;s book - fail to describe the efficient chromatographic procedures, like zone-melting chromatography, necessary for the manufacture of pure LSD. Timothy Scully told me that both he and Owsley believed the tolerable limits of impurities to be one tenth of a percentage point (requiring 99.9% purity) - far from the 50 percent figure of Michael Valentine Smith! Until careful studies are done, the true figures for tolerable impurities will remain unknown. <br /><br />How do these impurities change the optimum course of action of LSD and the experience it creates? One of the theories is that, because d-LSD-25 is like a key (its outer electron shell has a specific shape), it fits into a number of tiny locks called &quot;receptor sites.&quot; These are located somewhere in the brain - nobody is sure where, but one theory suggests that they might be in the brain stem. It is known, however, that these receptor sites interact only with extremely specific molecular configurations.<br /><br />The various ergot compounds, cycloalkamides of LSD and lumi-LSD plug into the same receptor sites as LSD does. But these compounds evidently don&#039;t turn the lock in the smooth, clean manner of LSD. Many of these compounds have effects similar to symptoms of ergot poisoning - the St. Anthony&#039;s Fire of the Middle Ages. These symptoms include inflamed joints, headaches, nausea, and hot and cold flashes.<br /><br />Isomers of LSD are another possible contaminant and indeed are reported present by the drug analysis groups. There are four possible isomers of LSD, but only the d-lysergic acid diethyl amide form is active. The other rotation forms - l-lysergic acid diethyl amide, d and l iso-lysergic acid diethyl amide (contrary to recent reports!) - are inactive. they have no pharmacological role, except possibly as a catalyst for some latent effect of LSD, or to block the action of LSD at the receptor site. <br /><br />If a contaminated batch of diethyl amine is used in the manufacturing process, or if the chemist purposely decides to make them, LSD homologues might be present in the final crystal. Molecules similar to LSD in structure but with some addition, subtraction or rearrangement of action, homologues plug into the same keyhole that LSD does.<br /><br />Some of these homologues have profound effects that vary in course of action and potency. For example, the strongest of he homologues, ALD-52, has 91 percent the potency of LSD and is said to have a slightly different effect upon the mind (there is some dispute about this).<br /><br />However, as Albert Hofmann puts it in &quot;Drugs Affecting the Central Nervous System&quot;: LSD has the highest and most specific effect and may therefore be considered as the genuine prototype of psychotomimetic compounds.&quot;<br /><br />Thus, all impurities found in LSD are like imperfect keys. Such substances as ergot alkaloids, cycloalkamides and other lysergic acid derivatives, and LSD homologues and lumi-LSD are drugs that might open the door part way. But only pure LSD opens the doors of perception all the way.<br /><br />In addition to manufactured impurities, impurities can also arise from decomposition of LSD. Dr. Albert Hofmann points out in his paper &quot;The Chemistry of LSD&quot;: &quot;The free base as well as the tartrate of d-lysergic acid diethyl amide, like all lysergic acid derivatives, is very sensitive to light and oxidizing agents. All preparations must be stored carefully, protected from light and from oxygen of the air, to prevent them from being destroyed within a short time.&quot;<br /><br />Even if, by some chance, an underground batch were made pure, it would turn to bunk in time, especially if put in conventional underground packaging (blotter or windowpane) that does not protect it from light or air. Pharmaceutical LSD is stored in vacuum vials in nitrogen gas. A pure, viable form of black-market LSD should find its way to the consumer in a tablet coated with pure, inert buffering material or in a vacuum vial, but this expensive packaging is certainly not reconcilable with dealing for profit.<br /><br />Why is it that most of he underground LSD in the United States is made wrong? There are several other possible explanations. One chemist, for instance, told me that it was &quot;because all the pros are out of the field.&quot; That is to say, most underground chemists, whether motivated by altruism or greed, are incompetent to manufacture pharmaceutical-grade chemicals.<br /><br />Moreover, they often lack the money to buy the complicated equipment necessary to produce pharmaceutical-grade materials or to test their final product properly.<br /><br />Paranoia, too, can lead to faulty manufacture. A chemist often doesn&#039;t have the time to do a full scale procedure, or will take shortcuts to limit possible exposure to bursts.<br /><br />It would help if street-drug analysis groups perfected their methods of analysis. Many such groups do not have samples of the impurities that can exist in street acid, and are therefore unable to identify them.. In addition, their testing techniques are not up to the exacting task of determining the nature of their samples. Most rely on thin-layer chromatography, which can show only that LSD exists in a sample,, but not all of he other impurities lurking there.<br /><br />In a private correspondence, Dr Alexander T. Shulgin, a professor of toxicology at the University of California at Berkeley commented:<br /><br />In the usual analysis of LSD (such as done at PharmChem Foundation) one chromatographs an extract of the suspected drug, observes the resulting separation under UV light, and then sprays the plate with some color-generating agent such as paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde (PDAB). If there are impurities present that fluoresce (such as lysergic acid or iso-LSD) and that have mobility in the chromatographic separation, they will be seen. If impurities are present that have the intact indole-2-hydrogen atom, they will give blue to purple colors with PDAB. <br /><br />Both tests require, of course, that there are amounts present sufficient to be seen. But if the impurity does not fluoresce (as is known to occur with lumi-LSD or any of the photoaddition products) or will not react with PDAB (as would be found with 2-substituted impurities such as 2-oxo-ergots), then they (the impurities) would remain invisible. It is completely possible that an LSD sample could be grossly contaminated with impurities and, if they did not give any response to one of these two tests, it is highly likely that their presence would never even be suspected.<br /><br />Again, it would be helpful if street-drug analysis groups started looking for by-product impurities and established criteria for psychedelic chemical purity. They must stop labeling their impure samples &quot;LSD&quot;, a habit that suggests purity and thereby creates much confusing in the public mind and among drug writers. Instead they must clearly distinguish between street acid and pure, pharmaceutical LSD. And if they cannot afford the equipment to test LSD (mass spectrometers and electron microscopes), then they should let the public know about their true capacities. For that matter, none of the commercially sold drug-testing kits is capable of determining purity.<br /><br />Many early LSD users later gave up on acid and tried other methods of consciousness-expansion as available LSD became impure. They thought that LSD did not work any more, or blamed their heads, not realizing it was a change in the nature of the actual chemical. Thus, the increasing number of impurities led many people to repress the mystical experiences they had had, and retreat to a comfortable, &quot;cool&quot; conformity. Or they turned to Eastern gurus and Jesus movements.<br /><br />I suspect that impurities give people body trips (euphoria) rather than the pure mind trips of LSD (ecstasy). People turned to other euphoria-producing drugs (pot is on of these) because street acid fell into the realm of dishonest dealing games and lost the spiritual qualities of LSD. Just the fact that LSD did not work any more led people into attempts to escape from the all-too-static reality via coke, pot, tranquilizers, alcohol and smack.<br /><br />As experiences changed, the emphasis among the makers and distributors of LSD changed. In the beginning, the main motivation was spiritual - to turn people on. Much LSD was given for free, and dealing was just an amateur pastime. As LSD became another in a long list of body drugs, avarice polluted the spiritual stream.<br /><br />The real responsibility for all this lies not with the underground, or even the public, victims of brainwashing with beer and TV, but with the government. Today, a small elite of government-sanctioned scientists controls LSD in the United States. Despite the good their limited research does, their exclusive and narrow-sighted use of these drugs seems sad in the face of the much greater good that psychedelics could do if more widely used. Many suggestions for more rational use include making LSD a prescription drug, creating LSD centers or making LSD a patent medicine.<br /><br />The psychedelic movement, which has been in eclipse for ten years, will remain dormant until people can get LSD of known strength and purity. Until then, if you are an acidhead, chances are you&#039;ve never taken LSD.

				Hey guys, and girls alike 8) ... I came up with an awesome new way to ingest MDxx mixes, or any other substance that is in powder form, seeing as how they all taste wretched. I figured Id post it here for lack of a better thread to put it in. <br /><br />Now that i think about it, maybe a DIY thread, for anything DIY or crafty, but i digress. So for this you will need; starburst fruit flavored chewy candys, a means of cutting it, and your hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;First, cut a starburst in half, each half is good for a dose..then carfully unwrap it. Place the half a starburst between your thumb and pointer fingers, and begin to work it out flat, feeling out the thinka nd thin spots, trying to make it as thin an even as possible. It should flatten out to about 1&quot;x1&quot;. Pour your stuff in the center, then ever so gently, pick it up and pinch around the mound of stuff. Once a seal has been made around your stuff, you can begin to fold the ends over and compact it into a tight little candy filled candy cap. Slide that fucker on down the pipes, and with in no more than 10min, your flying like a eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;Hope some one can give it a try, its real fun for hippyflips, cause when your peaking on L it becomes an interesting activity, just be sure to have your amounts pre wieghed if this is the case. Hope you guys like it! Much love every one 8)

				Had a single dose of the December JC&#039;s Grey&#039;s over the weekend. NOM NOM.<br /><br />I have weird trips.

				Hey dude, its not just you. JCs older batch was laid with, what I suspect to be probably silver grade xtal, they have a heavy body load, but certainly not what I would call dirty.<br /><br />Ive yet to drop more than 3 at a time, from baseline, and they have a fuck of a come up. After the come up is done though , its beautifully dosed L. Also it would be 500ug@ 2 tabs, not 500mcg, common typo im sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;The shakes you where feeling was just the regular come up of a strong dose. Loads of electric energy, anxiety and muscle spasms are common. The stiffness you felt was most likely due to some vasoconstriction, also more common than not.

				Yes a thumb print, is dabbing your thumb, into crystal, which is equivalent to hundreds upon hundreds of doses. I think its more along the lines of seeing whether or not you truly love LSD. Whether or not there are any family members that are still distributing is any ones guess. I can vouch that there is still some of the worlds cleanest L coming out of NorCal.

				I&#039;ve done LSD twice now, 500ug both times. On both occasions I seemed to have a different sort of experience than most people describe. I don&#039;t really feel like I peak after a certain number of hours, but rather the comeup is the most intense part of the experience. I get absolutely mind-blowing visuals and a very intense body high, and after an hour or two it settles down into something more manageable and levels off for the next 10 hours. <br /><br />With this in mind, for my next trip tomorrow I was planning to take the same dose while at home so I could enjoy the craziest part of the ride stress-free, and then go out in public when things start to settle down. But I&#039;m a little concerned that maybe I won&#039;t have the same sort of results. I don&#039;t want to find myself going ego-dead while walking down the street. Is it safe to assume that if this is how LSD has affected me thus far it will continue to do so in this manner?<br /><br /><br />If it makes any difference, my past 2 trips have been from alllove and my next will be Tessellated&#039;s new WoW batch.

				I&#039;ve had LSD 3 times, the first 2 trips were maybe 120mcg total (envious&#039;s bitter shivas), but they tested as LSD.<br />The first was pretty mystic and nice, mild visuals but utter beauty.<br /><br />The second I mixed with some weed (which dosent always agree with me) I would up having a very confusing and paranoid time<br /><br />The third trip were on some of LucyDrops tabs, not sure what print they were though. My roommate/bestfriend/trip-buddy and I each ate 2 while walking home. About 60 minutes later we were at home chilling out on her bed and little was happening.

On both occasions I seemed to have a different sort of experience than most people describe. I don&#039;t really feel like I peak after a certain number of hours, but rather the comeup is the most intense part of the experience. I get absolutely mind-blowing visuals and a very intense body high, and after an hour or two it settles down into something more manageable and levels off for the next 10 hours. <br /><br />With this in mind, for my next trip tomorrow I was planning to take the same dose while at home so I could enjoy the craziest part of the ride stress-free, and then go out in public when things start to settle down. But I&#039;m a little concerned that maybe I won&#039;t have the same sort of results. I don&#039;t want to find myself going ego-dead while walking down the street. Is it safe to assume that if this is how LSD has affected me thus far it will continue to do so in this manner?<br /><br /><br />If it makes any difference, my past 2 trips have been from alllove and my next will be Tessellated&#039;s new WoW batch.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey dude, LSD is a very intricate molecule. In a sense that, it seems evident that one can not fully understand the effects and the true power of the L until one has dosed more than a hand full of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;LSD is very subjective, and each trip greatly depends on the individual. I would not suggest going out in public on such high doses of L, especially if your not seasoned. Mainly because if, and when for that matter, it comes time to interact with some one, who is not also on LSD, it is sure to be an epic fail, that is to say that the L is legit. At 500ug, i find it next to impossible to carry intelligent. or sane even, conversation with some one. Not with out waving a bright orange flag saying &quot;im on drugs&quot; any way. LOL.<br /><br />&nbsp;After some more trips, you will definitively be able to distinguish the peaks. At which time the kaleidoscopic patterns are undeniable. If your experiencing a heavy body load, more than just some tingles int he hands (slight vasoconstriction), then that is in direct correlation with the quality of LSD crystal. Very clean L has no body load what so ever, a bit of &#039;electric&#039; angst, but thats about it. Its not always a bad thing, not unless its ugly effects like a headache or nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;In conclusion, no, it is not so safe to assume that you have the effects of L on your mind and body down to a predictable science. Much love dude.

In order to get the true beauty of the L, the trips have to be at LEAST 2-3 weeks apart. If that was in fact the case, then only thing i can see is that maybe the other tabs where some how degrated, from heat or moisture. That seems to far more common than people tend to give credit to. <br /><br />&nbsp;Yes smoking weed on L can get very intense, in a head fuck kind of manor.

				The first 2 trips were both pretty magical and from the same tabs a few weeks apart. The latest one was months after the first 2 and was pretty recent. I&#039;m going to chalk it up to degradation because the 3rd trip also made me mildly nauseous and gave me a headache.<br /><br />I do doubt it was an RC though because I&#039;m pretty familiar with the 2c-x series and I would assume DOx would feel similar. Also, I&#039;ve had 25c NBOMe before and I swallow all my LSD tabs just to be sure that they are not NBOMes

				No need for apologize Onionman, In this thread, anything L, goes. I my self am feeling a bit wacky, hopped up on some Ketaler and a foot long ham sandwich 8) Lately I have been smoking copious amounts of hash, and it pairs beautifully with a head full of LSD.<br /><br />@Ian, I dont think that degradation will give you the nausea and headaches, but dirty LSD will. Not to bash any lesser known vendors, but my advice would be to stick to those that are tried and true. Once you&#039;ve pegged the Lovely Lucy, and learned her ways through and through, then from there, you will be able to indecisively determine who has what it is you search for. Do your learning with those that have flawless reps, such as 3jane, or del ellis.. I know Del&#039;s listings are few and far apart, but jane not so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;If possible, grab up a 1/4 or 1/2 sheet from Jane asap, dose as needed, no more than once every 20-30 days.. When you are done with that half or quarter block, you should by that time, know our intriguing little molecule like the back of your hand. Much love

Even if you where to obtain xtal, doing a thumbprint anywhere other than a designated area, with a sitter, would seem just plain silly. You have to imagine just how much acid is in a thumbprint, prob along the lines of a few hundred doses. I believe it was said that 1g of xtal is roughly equivalent to 10,000 tabs.

But in all honesty how could i even begin to grasp that concept unless i&#039;ve first handedly expierienced it. Found this post on another forum you guys might like&nbsp; it : -- :)<br /><br /><br /><br />It is hard to describe a thumbprint. Human language cannot describe an experiance that is encompasses all of life. Every cell of every creature or living thing that ever lived or will live is connected by the energy or light. When we die are body and our ego is gone. We become one with eternity or the light or God or whatever name you wish to call it. A thumbprint allows this to happen and rerturn to our physical body. My first print I layed down and quickly realized that this was my actual death. You watch the whole process unfold with complete awareness.<br />I didn&#039;t cling to my body I just realized my life had passed. As I was spiraling up or out I saw my life evolve through the years I lived. The happiness, the sadness,the people I loved and the people I didn&#039;t. The joy that I gave and the pain that I caused. I saw the true nature of reality and why things were the way they were. As I got higher I saw the nature of reality on the cosmic scale and saw that the reason for our evolution was to experiance love. To love is to have experianced the finest of life. Then came the moment were it was time to let go. As I did it came for me and I sobbed uncontrolabley for I realized that the light or energy we call god or creation was perfect. It was pure unconditional love.<br />What else could god have been I realized. That glint of innocent perfection in a baby&#039;s eye. The light was pure as the heart of Jesus Christ. I dissolved into it and died. Since there was no me only the all ,I cannot remember the rest because there was no me to remember. After forever I slowly decended into my body.<br />I spent days awake afterwards talking to myself. I vowed to god to spread LSD so others could see the light. I vowed to look at every person as the lord and treat them as such.<br />I was reborn and continue to live by the values I learned. I became as active as I could spreading LSD. Year after year in hotel rooms with a pyrex pan and watercolor paper. Hoping excitedly that some of these hit&#039;s will help guide my brothers and sisters back towards the light. LSD is a direct message from God. Period. I don&#039;t think we get another chance. We can love each other or we can kill each other ,but it is up to us. As I always say in my threads as a reminder, my work with LSD ended years ago.<br /><br />As for your question about eating and going to the bathroom. I don&#039;t think I ate for a week afterwards. As for going to the bathroom I hadn&#039;t eaten before hand at my guides advise so it wasn&#039;t a problem. I remember letting go as it got dark and coming back a lttle before sunrise. I was high for along time afterwards and as I said earlier you never fully return. I feel high all the time still and its been years.<br />Also I did many, many prints after that. I have eaten a lot of crystal but it was never like that first time.<br />I must stress that I was in the company of very evolved and older people that made sure my experiances were optimal. These were kind old spirits that had been were I was going many years before and many times. They held me as a baby every inch of the way. <br /><br />You have heard of near death experiances right. A thumbprint is a beyond death experiance.<br />I have a rich life now thats full of good fortune. A wonderful wife and 3 children who are completely wonderful. Every day is complete joy. I couldn&#039;t ask for more, but I know it will end one day for good. I&nbsp; await this day with no fear ,but the knowlege that that most rewarding and enlightening experiance of life is death.

				Hi guys, I&#039;ve got a question for you experienced acidheads. Last time I tripped on lsd was exactly 1 week after the previous lsd trip. I anticipated some tolerance, so upped the dose with 50% compared to the previous trip, 300 ug vs 200 ug the week before. The tabs I took were from the same supplier and batch. Setting was the same, and set was comparable to the week before I guess.<br /><br />The come-up felt promising, but there was something seriously lacking in the rest of the trip. Almost like the magic that was experienced the week before was totally absent. Also the quality of the visuals was much lower compared to the week before. Still had an interesting time tho, but really wasn&#039;t comparable to the experience the week before.<br /><br />Is it a safe assumption that 1 week between trips is not enough to trip to full potential? How long do you guys wait between trips to have an optimal experience again?<br /><br />I hope you guys can share your wisdom and experiences to make this lsd novice a bit wiser&nbsp; :)

For example, at a festival thats 4 days long, I&#039;m dosing all day everyday so its like one long trip. In the sense your talking about, I believe that your mind remembers the &quot;magic&quot; you feel to well because it happened too recently, therefore making it seem not as &quot;magical&quot;... In my opinion if you were to give it 3-7 weeks before another acid trip, you&#039;ll be happy :).<br /><br />Also, i find that bigger doses for me keep the magic in it if you were to have to dose a week after(for a show or something).

				I want you to try to shoot this idea down, if you can&#039;t then maybe you could just tell me what you think?<br /><br />LSD for treating Asperger syndrome.<br /><br />I have heard many people claim that Asperger is a genetic disorder, but this is not proved. The people I know with Asperger Syndrome all have been abused by at least one of their parents. To me it seems that emotional trauma might be at least one possible cause for the Syndrome.<br /><br />I was once told by a psychiatrist that I had mild Asperger, mild enough to not get a diagnosis, since I could basically function normally. I have always had problems with social interaction, but I have been blind to this a lot of the time. I have been very mean to people at times without realizing it. However, starting three years ago in the beginning of my psychedelic adventure things changed dramatically. I started to understand and *value* how other people felt. I lost interest in self-satisfaction and became a much better friend, a more fluent conversationalist and less introverted. <br /><br />How did this happen? The network of social interaction in groups of people appeared to me in hallucinations while tripping with others, these networks mapped the impact and consequences of different emotions giving me a larger perspective on the meaning and cause of emotions, and also how people expressed them in subtle ways.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I would call myself &quot;cured&quot;, but the use of LSD while interacting with other people has made a significant difference and at times I feel a deeper emotional understanding of people than I believe many other &quot;normal&quot; people do.<br /><br />I have seen no research on the subject, and I doubt it would work for everybody, but damn, it is something that I want to spread because Asperger is a terrible handicap, even when it is as mild as mine was. I destroyed so many friendships just by having no social common sense. I hope others with the same problem can get some of the help I got :D

Do you think the improvement lasts even through long periods of abstinence from any psychedelics?<br /><br />So many questions ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i think it has helped a lot, especially with being able to &quot;read&quot; people, their vibes and energy, something people with aspergers normally have a hard time doing. i do think that social conditions can have an impact on how aspergers affects a person, that is somewhat proven in the field, with occupational therapists helping with this. one of the problems though is that aspergers was recently taken off of the medical list of illness, which pissed off a lot of people int he aspergers community. i know a lot of people who would be able to do this kind of research, but i&#039;m going to try and get them to do a study on marijuana and helping aspergers first, as i think it helped me a lot growing up and would be a easier study to get started then LSD. if you want to do more with it, check out the apsergers self advocacy network, i&#039;m friendly with the person who started it/runs it, and i think he might be interested in what you have to say about research/ a study being done.

It surprises me however that Marijuana is being studied in this context; when I smoke I become very asocial and introverted, even though I come to a lot of useful insights.

				Really awesome thread!<br />I think there is definitely something to the treatment of mental illness with psychedelics, I mean, if they can completely change a sober person&#039;s view of the world and themselves, then why would it be any different for psychiatric patients? Obviously a great deal more care should be taken as to not diminish their mental condition, yet I&#039;m sure a proper dose of clean LSD could at least improve the condition of people who suffer from mild depression e.t.c. <br />As for marijuana, I suffer from an appetite disorder and insomnia - both of which are effectively cured when I have at least twice-daily access to a smoke. So in my mind there is no doubt as to it&#039;s medical value.<br />- JH

He is familiar with the idea of drugs.<br /><br />He has been home schooled by his hippy, pot smoking, mother (and has eaten weed brownies on a few occasions), so he&#039;s not a purely innocent child.

				IDK about horrible or wrong, im no one to judge. I do want to say though, there is a good chance he may very well lose his shit and harsh your mellow if you and your friends are trying to enjoy your selves.<br /><br />&nbsp;I gave a friend a tab last night, it was his first time doing L. He lost his tits. He had to be babysat all night and morning long. Thats not to say that he didnt at all enjoy him self, but for him..and I alike to be honest, it was a bit scary.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;The problem i would see with dosing some one so young, like in your case, is mainly that, that person, is yet to in fact be a person. That age is fundamental for developing his own individuality, which i feel LSD would not be very good for at such a young age. <br /><br />&nbsp;As with any case, do as you please, just my two cents here. Much love.

He will just think he has gone insane. I mean damn, I would feel that way if I had never tripped on anything before. But my friends have done that to one another on a few occasion. <br /><br />A few hours after breakfast w/laced beverage on his birthday.... &quot;damn guys I feel fucking great...... almost like a took a big hit of acid!&quot; ....... (changes tone) &quot;Where&#039;d you slip it in?&quot; I thought I had him going but he played me.

Personally I&#039;d play it safe, I mean he may act mature, but his brain is still developing. I think the earliest one should dose is like 16, maybe 15. I mean 11? Pot&#039;s got nothing on acid. I remember a guy who was like late teens tripping for the first time, trying to compare it to weed and concluded, &quot;Yep, this is about one million bajillion times [as strong as] weed.&quot; I kept telling him you can&#039;t really compare the two. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think curiosity for both you and him is enough to justify tripping at that age.

				Ugh, very bad vibes. I have another order from Tess that should be arriving soon, placed before this recent business about reduced potency. Do I take the same number of tabs as last time and risk being underwhelmed, or do I take a larger amount and risk being overwhelmed? Are these newer results testing at 120-150ug from a batch newer than what was being sold one month ago?

				I&#039;ve been thinking about writing this for many years… maybe now is the time..?<br />All that&#039;s written here happened when I was 17 years old… many years ago and many trips ago… <br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br />My very first LSD trip went as such: me and a friend (both new to the L-world) took some L somewhere in his students&#039; flat. After a few beers and a few joints we were thinking: &quot;hey, we don&#039;t feel anything from this&quot;… but 10 minutes later my friend starts to act strangely… He wants to &quot;find normality&quot;… He does all kind of stuff to find it… and somewhere along that road he suggests: &quot;He, let&#039;s throw you out of the window to see if you&#039;d fly&quot;… <br />Thank God I was able to calm him down before he actually threw me out of the window… <br /><br />A few weeks later, my friend and I would go to a party. I had some &#039;srooms with me and lots of other &quot;funny products&quot;. As usual I start dosing, a bit of everything together with some more of everything - but to him I say: &quot;best not to take anything since your last experience was quite weird&quot;…<br />but a&nbsp; bit later I&quot;m to wasted and I don&#039;t realize that he eats some of my &#039;shrooms. <br /><br />And 2 or 3 hours later we&#039;re out there, in that town, next to the train station a few hundreds meters from the party, and he&#039;s flipping out. <br />He tries to hit me. I dive. He tries to hit me again, I dive. <br />He think&#039;s I want to kill him… (but I don&#039;t!)<br />BASICLY: he&#039;s tripping out of his head and thinks I&#039;m gone kill him… ? my best friend? <br /><br />whatever….<br />damn, fuck this… I&#039;ll write later…<br /><br />next attempt:<br />he tries to hit me, I dive, he tries to hit me, I dive…. then he starts to talk to me. Im kneeling on the ground. The moment I try to get up he tries to kick me. So I get back on my knees. Now we can talk - he talks to me as he would talk to a frog… <br />- we talk -<br />then he asks me for a glass of orange juice… so I go and get one for him at the party, but when I come back to him he&#039;s laughing. &quot;I called my mam, I called my mam!&quot;. <br /><br />Godddamn… what to do? … I&#039;m tripping...<br /><br />I decide to stay, to help my friend. Stay with him - because he&#039;s lost it. <br />I don&#039;t care about myself, my safety, my future (I got the LSD a few weeks ago, I got the shrooms this week - if this get&#039;s out I can end up with LOTS of problems!) - I just don&#039;t care about myself, I stay there to help my friend…<br /><br />So we wait for his mom to come and get him (at 3AM). <br /><br />4 AM his mother get&#039;s there… he get&#039;s in the car and asks her to drive away saying that I want to kill him. His mother takes him in the car and drives 100m. They talk for 5 minutes. I wait. The car comes back. <br />I look at his mother and say: &quot;miss, your boy and I have taken LSD some weeks ago, tonight he took some shrooms from me and now he&#039;s stuck in a bad trip. I&#039;m sorry for that but I stayed because I wanted to help him. Now you need to help him, to make him feel safe, to bring him home and nurture him. Give him some orange juice or so and keep him warm, comfortable and safe… That way he&#039;ll be fine, Miss…&quot;. <br /><br />5AM his mother asks me if I want to get in the car. I say I can handle myself and I&#039;ll go somewhere safe. She asks me where that is. I tell her where it is. She says she&#039;ll bring me there. But my friend doesn&#039;t want me in the car - he still think&#039;s I&#039;m trying to kill him. She tell&#039;s him to be quiet. <br />She says: &quot;OK, but what about you? How will you do now? Get in the car and I&#039;ll bring you to your *safe place*&quot;. <br /><br />I was amazed by this woman at that moment… never a woman amazed me more than at that moment… she was trying to take care of me - even after what her boy had told her and even after what I had told her… <br /><br />So I got in the car and she drove me to my safe place… there I crawled into a bed next to a very good friend, felt safe and in the end I got some sleep as well… <br /><br />Next day I tried to call my friend, I got his mam on the phone: &quot;Yes, he&#039;s doing fine - but you will understand that we don&#039;t want you to have contact with him for a while.&quot;. <br />Off course I understood, my friends mind was still not back to normal… somewhere he got a &quot;bump&quot; on his road… it took him many years to get over that &quot;bump&quot;. During those years, each time I&#039;d call him I could hear his voice change when he recognized mine… his voice changed into the voice he used when he was trying to kick me in the face in front of the station… he voice changed into the voice he was using when speaking to the frog...<br />I loved my friend (and still do), a great guy, so I kept calling him and supporting him threw out the years and now we can laugh about it… <br /><br />But all this writing is just an introduction to my first real LSD experience… one that wasn&#039;t born without pain…nor complications as you could already read. <br />During the previous LSD-experience I had ingested some acid, but hadn&#039;t felt the effect of it. That would change… <br /><br />A few months after this endeavor I had met other people and had gotten deeper into the psychedelic scene in my country. I met another guy who wanted to go to a very special festival and we decided to go together… waow, that was a special place… really special - decoration, vibes, music, people, … quite select psychedelic scene, end of the 90&#039;s… <br /><br />At the beginning of the evening we drop some MDMA pills (if I remember right) and we go to the dance floor. Shortly after arriving there my new friend comes to me and says: &quot;I know someone who has good LSD. Wanna get some?&quot;. <br />I still wanted to understand what LSD was all about, so off course I said: &quot;yes!&quot;. <br />So we go to this dealer, and older guy with a white beard and no shirt. He looks at us in the backlight and gives us 2 blotters… <br /><br />We put that on our tongue and continue dancing, like if nothing major was gone happen… oh boy, oh boy… <br /><br />I&#039;d say about 30 minutes later we look at each other (my newly met friend and myself) and we&#039;re like: &quot;Hey, let&#039;s go to the tent and smoke a joint, relax a bit and drink some water maybe.&quot;, &quot;Yeah, sounds good. Let&#039;s go&quot;. <br /><br />So we leave the dance floor and go down to the tents. I can&#039;t remember anything from the walk threw the forest - it was all decorated with backlights and stuff all over the trees and what not… it must have been beautiful but I just can&#039;t remember anything from that walk. <br /><br />Then we get at our tent, we sit down, relax a bit and have a sip of water (instead of the beer we were having at the dance floor). We smoke a joint and lay down for a while. Our bodies feel quite heavy, but without any real LSD experience we don&#039;t really know what is happening - so we just decide to get in the tent and see what&#039;s coming… <br /><br />Once in the tent I start to try &#039;n roll a joint… but I just can&#039;t roll it anymore - the weed keeps on running away from the tobacco. Every time I put some more weed on the paper, it runs away… I try and I try and I try, but it&#039;s just impossible to roll a joint at this stage. So I put it aside and look at my friend. He&#039;s laughing at me, &quot;wow, this is intense&quot;… <br /><br />Damn, yes it is intense… it&#039;s getting harder and harder to move… soon we&#039;re almost not able to move our body anymore. <br /><br />I start to feel uncomfortable. I feel sick. I feel in danger. I feel I should run for help but i can&#039;t move. I can&#039;t move. My leg&#039;s don&#039;t move. I want to scream! <br />I want to scream but I can&#039;t scream! I can&#039;t scream! I can&#039;t run away! <br />Help! <br />I don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening. <br /><br /><br />Oh boy, oh boy - what&#039;s happening… <br />my throat starts to swell, I can hardly swallow. It&#039;s painful to swallow. I can&#039;t breath. <br />Can I breath? Am I breathing? I don&#039;t know… I hurts. <br />What hurts? I don&#039;t know - everything. <br />My body, my head, my fingers… <br /><br />I rub my fingers against each other. I feel blood between my fingers. I feel needles sticked in my fingers. I feel needles everywhere. I feel needles over my whole body. I feel needles piercing my skin over my whole body, every square cm there are 4 needles in my skin. I can&#039;t see them. I can&#039;t open my eyes. I can&#039;t open my eyes. <br />But I can feel them. They are piercing my skin. I&#039;m bleeding. I&#039;m bleeding everywhere. I can feel the warmth of my blood on my skin. I&#039;m bleeding. I&#039;m loosing my blood. I&#039;m in pain. It hurts. I&#039;m bleeding from all those needles. Everywhere where I have skin there are needles. <br />Even on my tongue there are needles. My tongue is bleeding. I swallow my blood. There is too much blood. I can&#039;t swallow it all. It&#039;s too much blood. It hurts. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening. I have needles all over my body, piercing my skin and I&#039;m suffocating in my own blood. Help! I need help, but I can&#039;t speak. I can&#039;t open my eyes. I&#039;m in pain… I&#039;m suffocating in my blood! I&#039;m suffocating!!!<br /><br />* and then * all of a sudden * comes one thought * like a star from heaven *<br />&quot;Wait, I&#039;m not sober. I&#039;m under influence. I took LSD. I&#039;m tripping.&quot;<br /><br />So I&#039;m still in pain, agonizing pain, but at least I remember now that I took some LSD. But I&#039;m still in so much pain. I&#039;m still not able to breath because I&#039;m suffocating in my own blood… I&#039;m scared and alone, I can&#039;t open my eyes and I can&#039;t speak or scream… <br /><br />*then * another * thought * comes * in * like * a * little * star * to * rescue * me: <br />&quot;I took LSD because I want to understand it, because I want to experience the miracle of it. I took LSD because I want to learn and to have fun. I choose to do this. &quot;<br /><br />and then, just at once - the pain goes away, the suffocating goes away, the needles go away… all the darkness goes away and I can see myself, or at least some form of myself… <br />and bit by bit that form of myself is torn apart. First in big pieces, then in smaller pieces. I can see it happen. It scares me and it hurts me, but I don&#039;t feel the pain nor the fear. But it&#039;s painful and scary. <br />And I&#039;m getting torn apart, bit by bit - smaller and smaller. <br />Limbs, leg&#039;s, organs, then tissues, then systems, them molecules, then atoms… then… <br />then…<br />then there is only 1 atom left. there is no more pain left. no more fear. no more scariness or whatsoever. nothing left. only this one atom… but even this atom is torn. it explodes in my face. the light blinds me… it hurts my eyes but I can&#039;t scream - there is no &quot;I&quot;, there is no body, no voice, no mind to pronounce pain - there is no. <br /><br />this atom explodes, <br />and explodes, <br />and explodes,<br />in my face - really IN MY FACE, not on it, but in it. <br />it explodes and then it implodes again, <br />then it explodes and implodes…<br />and again…<br />and again…<br />and I&#039;m in the middle of it;<br />but there is no &quot;I&quot; - just perception (note: kind of like the camera of a journalist, but without the journalist)<br />and I explode and I implode<br />and again <br />and again<br /><br />this goes on for long…<br />I don&#039;t know how long… <br />but LOOONG - maybe for hours<br /><br />then this stops and I start to float<br />float between the stars<br />or not<br />but float between bright points of light<br />floating<br />no body, no thinking mind, no heartbeat or breathing - just the universe<br />I&#039;m the universe<br />the universe is what I am…<br />floating<br /><br />no more pain, no more fear, no more needles - not even the memory of it, not even words,<br />no nothing, <br />only the universe<br />my mind without me<br />only &quot;a&quot; mind<br />the universe<br /><br />and I float and float and float and float… <br /><br />then bit by bit my body starts to reappear in this universe - but at first it&#039;s not my body, it&#039;s just a body that&#039;s being constructed from scratch, from the atoms, from the molecules, from the tissues, from the organs,… bit by bit this body is being rebuild again…<br />bit by bit consciousness is starting to come again… <br />words are coming back - words to think<br /><br />then I accept my body as it accepts me. I&#039;m still tripping very hard, but from within a body (a body within the trip). with this body I meet people, I see things, I experience all kind of non-describable thing&#039;s. <br /><br />and then, after many hours for the first time there is something as a &quot;feeling&quot;, a &quot;bodily feeling&quot;. But the senses have been &quot;twisted&quot;… I &quot;feel odours&quot;, I &quot;hear smell&quot;, I &quot;touch sound&quot;, I &quot;smell pressure&quot;… very strange sensations… I know it&#039;s not supposed to be sensed that way, but still it feels natural at this moment<br /><br />but then the realization comes: this is a trip and it&#039;s about to end… but I don&#039;t want it to end… so I try to run towards it, but the more I run towards it, the more my senses are awakened and the more I&#039;m un-tripping.<br /><br />after approximately 8 or 9 hours out of my body I come back to my &quot;self&quot;. <br />after maybe 10 hours I can open my eyes again. <br />I try to roll a joint, the weed still runs away but not as fast as before. Now I&#039;m able to roll the joint. <br />I open the tent. It&#039;s a bright day out there. <br />My friend opens his eyes. <br />&quot;Waow&quot; he sais. We can&#039;t say more at this point yet. <br />I just ask him: &quot;you ok?&quot; - he says: &quot;OK&quot;. <br />that&#039;s it for now. <br /><br />we look outside the tent. <br />There is a world out there. <br />wow, it&#039;s beautiful. <br />so many colours. <br />waow. <br />nothing ever looked as beautiful as it does now. <br /><br />the memories of the night are too intense to cope with right now.<br />we just smoke some weed and look at the world. <br />then we try to drink water - like if we never drank water before, like if it was the first time we drank, the first time ever…. how do you drink? <br /><br />the throat that was gasping for air a few hours ago, the throat that was filled with needles, the throat that was suffocating in its own blood - that throat now drinks water for the first time ever… this is unreal… <br />it feels like I just left reality to come back to &quot;this&quot;.<br /><br />after a few hours we get up and pack our stuff<br />we brake up the tent and go home, the party is finished and all need to leave <br />in the train we sit next to some old hippies<br />they speak with us<br />I have no idea what they said to us<br />I&#039;m still tripping a bit - colors, sounds, senses… <br />can&#039;t remember how I got home.<br /><br />it took me many months to assimilate and accept all that I had seen/experienced/been during this incredible experience. <br />without ANY doubt the single most painful moments of my life<br />but also without ANY doubt the single most beautiful and rewarding moments of my life. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m twice as old as I was then. <br />I tripped probably over 100 times since then on almost every possible substance<br />but I&#039;ve never had such a profound experience again - ever…<br /><br />I keep on looking for it, <br />but be sure that I&#039;m also scared of it…<br />I would give so much to be able to experience the second part of this trip again, but I would give even more to NOT experience the first part of this trip again…<br /><br />Without any doubt this was a deep and profound &quot;ego-death&quot;. <br />Since then, it feels like I don&#039;t need to have my ego die any more when tripping - I can trip out of my body without &quot;all of this fuzz&quot;. <br />Don&#039;t know why. Don&#039;t know what exactly happened. I know I was VERY close to going insane. To going crazy. I really walked the line. I was on the line where I could choose to go left and become crazy or go right and stay &quot;sane&quot;. I decided not to go crazy then, but I could just as well have decided to do… <br /><br />I know tenths of people who&#039;ve taken LSD and I&#039;ve spoken to hundreds of people about it, but there is only 1 person I know of who can really relate to the experience I tried to describe here… <br />I&#039;m not sure many people have the opportunity to experience this in such a profound way, in such a conscious way… but maybe I&#039;m mistaking. <br /><br />This was my first attempt at writing down what happened then - many, many years ago. While writing I was trembling and almost re-experiencing the whole thing again (I must admit that I took some ketamine to write this), I could almost feel the pain and the fear again - but the beauty, no. The beauty was so intense I can&#039;t even remember it right. I can&#039;t re-experience that, it was too much - there is no way of really re-experiencing this without going the whole way again, you can&#039;t just remember the beauty, it would only be a small image of a huge totality. Like a 1 square meter painting of a landscape that covers 1 thousands of square meters… <br /><br />Bottom line is: I&#039;m very happy it happened to me. This moment was defining for the rest of my life and it saved my life as well…. it was the most intense, beautiful, painful, joyful, scary and *total* experience I ever had.

				Hi guys, got a question. Does eating while tripping on acid lessens the intensity of the trip? If so, is this with eating in general, or only with certain kinds of foods? On most of my trips I get hungry at some point, and have something to eat, fruits mostly. It seems that after the meal, I feel a little less high than before. Could be that I&#039;m just coming down, as I mostly eat after the peak, but maybe you guys can tell me if eating gets you down faster?

				Hey guys I have a question and it&#039;s a bit embarrassing but I couldn&#039;t find any answer to this specific question so I thought I&#039;d ask it here. I tripped off acid about two days ago and I think the culprit that triggered my bad trip was the fact that I slightly held my piss a second too long and coincidentally it was around the 6 hour mark where things really got intense, visual loops and melting vision and all. So I make my way to the bathroom and find out I feel like I can barely piss, only thing I could think in my mind is &quot;vasoconstriction?&quot; then I felt like I damaged my self because a vein near my leg felt strained from holding the urine before I got to the bathroom. Any who it&#039;s better kinda pinching a bit but I&#039;m guessing it&#039;ll be gone in a few days. The real question though is do most of you get really hydrated before tripping and then restrict all intakes of fluid as it gets closer to the peak or do you drink throughout the whole thing. I mean maybe it was in my mind all but I really felt like I couldn&#039;t piss.

				LOL, thats funny, because I also have issues with pissing when on L.. most all the time, i dont keep track of how much ive drank, some times alot, some times not much at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;When im teetering on ego loss, all day or not while tripping i catch myself literally grabbing my dick cause i come very close to pissing myself, or at least it feels like it, then when i go pee, some times nothing, some times a struggle then some tinkles. Im not sure what goes on here with tthis, but your not the only one with urinary troubles when tripping.

				Haha that&#039;s good to know, well next time I&#039;ll just be sure to listen to my body. It was really my first time tripping like that and I had my bro with me so I kept goofing around saying in my mind &quot;okay i&#039;m going to go to the bathroom now&quot; but the fun just got the best of me lol. The same thing happened to me though it was a struggle and then mostly nothing. I just keep wishing I would have went, I don&#039;t regret it though that bad trip was really in a strange way great. Like being a kid scared to go into the haunted house but find that in the end everything is ok. It was honestly my biggest fear but now I feel even more confident in my ability to control my self. I just can&#039;t get over the fact that I literally watched everything in front of me melt. The people on the t.v. I grabbed my shirt and it just drooped down like silly puddy. Then it was a commercial that just kept looping until I realized that I was paying attention to the loop and there was a face that was had no expression then smiled. I kept looking and the smile just got progressively more evil and looking devilish it was crazy man I had no idea it could go so far.

				On pissing on LSD: I used to get the problem sometimes, sometimes not.&nbsp; I agree that I usually don&#039;t usually pay any attention to pissing while tripping, but on the other hand I&#039;m usually good to keep myself hydrated by drinking lots of water. Sometimes you just don&#039;t really feel the need to piss when it&#039;s there. I think that ultimately what it was was subconsciously clenching the dick or whatever part down there holds the piss in. I think the best solution is to try not to do that, but even more so, go to the bathroom right when you have to go, holding in piss/shit can make you hold it in longer than you wanted to.

				I always try to take a good piss either before I drop or 30 mins in.<br />I drink normally throughout the trip, maybe a little more than normal.<br />By the time I have to piss again, I&#039;m usually on the downslope of my peak - though it can be somewhat difficult.<br />I find if it is difficult, not to sweat it and sit down for a poop with some comic books or play some crazy games on my phone.

				I&#039;m reading this book &#039;The Psychedelic Experience&#039; at the moment, written by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert. <br />The book is a translation/interpretation of the Tibetan book of the dead, from a psychedelic point of view.

Many tips are given for all stages of the trip.<br /><br />Having &#039;accidentally&#039; experienced this state one time myself, I completely understand why one would make this the goal of a trip. To experience this &#039;one truth&#039; was truly beautiful, it did change my perspective on many things, might call it life changing. So I&#039;m kinda exited to try and use this book to guide me back to that state.<br /><br />Did any of you guys read this book, was it helpful for you? Parts seem a little vague to me, I have some doubts about the effectiveness of the given tips.

				Responding to question I redirected from the avengers thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.msg1029912#msg1029912">Quote from: dimmu on April 19, 2013, 12:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi all...<br /><br />This is the first time I&#039;ve had an opportunity to mix n match tabs thanks to the abundance of lucy on SR. Approx 17 days ago I dropped 1.5 of Tess WOW and had a great experience, euphoria and visuals. 6 days ago I dropped 1 Gandalf which I assume was originally sourced from JC and experienced amazing euphoria but only the slightest visuals (perhaps due to short turn around.)<br /><br />How often do you guys mix n match different tabs? I am feeling musically creative and will be dropping some lucy this weekend. The turnaround is 7 days. I was thinking:<br />1 tess and 1 gandalf or<br />2 gandalf or<br />1 tess and 2 gandalf.<br /><br />I desire to achieve visuals and the typical acid euphoria but need to be able to operate computer sequencing software. Any suggestions/advise would be welcome and I apologize if my post deviates from the OP intentions (it&#039;s all about acid at the end of the day.)<br /><br />Cheers lucy lovers<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally I think you would have to be very, very intuitive to be able to mix and match with any sort of consideration other than simply adding up the dosages, and if the effects of certains acids really stand out. In terms of being able to use that software, I think that dosage &amp; functionality on said dosage always depends on the tripper. I am usually ALWAYS good on anything less than 400ug for any task and most of the time I can function for most things (especially those creative in nature) up very high, but sometimes when I go to a very high dose (800-1200ug) my thoughts come TO me, rather than being FROM me.<br /><br />I think that tomorrow, since it being LSD&#039;s big day and all, I think I&#039;ll be taking a piece of all the LSD I own, which ends up being from 7 or 8 sources, wish me luck!

Now im not sure what your experience level with LSD is,&nbsp; but the euro shit, while being much more visualy intense, it lacks in euphoria a bit, as opposed to north american L, thats super dreamy.&nbsp; I have to make a note to evry one, that really clean L , like JORs, or 3Jane&#039;s, is just as, if not more visually intense, at proper doses, only thing is, its a bit different. If your looking around, and just observing, its very mild, but the minute you pick something to look at, open your eyes wide, and zone the fuck out.. theres nothing like it. Objects will grow from 2ft to 20ft before your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;All that being said, best of luck to you friend 8)

				Oh you lucky and fine people, how jealous am I of many of you :-)<br />I do hope that many of you celebrate this day by embracing this fine lady called Lucy.<br />Reading thru the her&nbsp; first encounter with humanity recounted to us by her &quot;father&quot; - Dr Albert Hoffman - is the only way I can allow myself to honour her today. <br /><br />Since my memories of his first trip report are very fresh I thought I shall share them with you here:<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Last Friday, April 16,1943, I was<br />forced to interrupt my work in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the laboratory in the middle of the<br />afternoon and proceed home,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; being affected by a remarkable<br />restlessness, combined with a slight<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; dizziness. At home I lay down and<br />sank into a not unpleasant<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; intoxicated-like condition,<br />characterized by an extremely stimulated<br />imagination. In a dreamlike state,<br />with eyes closed (I found the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; daylight to be unpleasantly glaring),<br />I perceived an uninterrupted<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; stream of fantastic pictures,<br />extraordinary shapes with intense,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; kaleidoscopic play of colors. After<br />some two hours this condition<br />faded away.&quot;<br /><br />(C) Albert Hofmann: &quot;LSD - My problem child&quot;<br /><br />I am sure that most of you know this passage by heart, but if you, like me have no chance for a proper trip you might enjoy re-reading what must have started this new prolific genre of writing called travel literature :-)<br /><br />Could this honourable gentleman be called &quot;her father&quot;?<br /><br />Happy bicycle day you all... I still wonder why we do not celebrate it on the 16th.

				Hey incog, also i notice the doses you mention, are quite minimal. Anything under 4-500ug, isnt very much at all.. The intense &#039;growing&#039; of objects, is only achieved for me, on at least 500ug. Then again, i never seem to be able to wait more than 14 days between trips. hehe.

But almost any surface looks cool. Last trip I was taking a piss in the bathroom and the&nbsp; blue wall ended up looking like it had scales like a reptile and waves like the ocean. Pissed again there yesterday and was surprised at how normal the wall looked -- I thought the paint must have dried in a scale like fashion, but there was nothing remotely there.

				My absolute favourites are trees, clouds, swell and sand on a beach.<br />Everything is breathing like nature intended when you are sober. When you are helped this breathing is so overwhelming and cosmic energy is so evident! If you come across a book by David Bohm - Wholeness and Implicate Order - genious book! Check out where David - a nuclear physicist with passion for particle physics - started his journey - on the beach in California where first time sensed this cosmic energy. I am sure he must have been helped by this kind lady Lucy :-)

				I had some pretty damn mind-bending experiences on acid and nitrous oxide this weekend. Going to write a report, but try to keep it simple and short between the points of interest :)<br /><br />Dose: 1 tab of Fartbombers Avatars (117µg), 1 tab of GammaGoblin&#039;s Hofmann tabs (110-120µg), 0.5-1 g of fresh cubensis.<br /><br />I was together with trusted friends and psychonauts at a small party (10-20 people). Dropped the acid early on and danced through the first hour and discussed various drug experiences. Got strong visuals early on, the same pattern reiterated on every imaginable surface. A friend had made a mushroom elixir from fresh cubensis, honey, mint and red wine that tasted amazing, like pure unabashed joy.&nbsp; DJ:ed the second hour, lots of Psy Dub (Globular, Ott, Hinkstep). Hard to keep track of one&#039;s setlist when you&#039;re tripping balls :) Somewhere in the third or fourth hour the nitrous oxide reared its pretty head.<br /><br />I had forgotten how bizarre and powerful the combination of LSD and Laughing Gas is. Sitting on the floor I inhaled and kept my breath for as long as I could. As I started exhaling I felt the world warp. I saw a friend looking at me and through me - in my head his voice rang &quot;When you go deep enough, you will find me there, staring back at you&quot;. The song playing on the stereo was &quot;All along the watchtower&quot; by the guitar god himself and I could hear the frequencies of his screeching guitar seperating into hundreds of layers, and each layer contained the entire story of my life, as it was, yet at a different pitch. As the song ended I felt that so must I end, and that I have been here a thousand times before and that I would return here another thousand times.<br /><br />A friend sat down beside me, I said one single sentence &quot;This is impossible.&quot; And the loop ended, I returned to a more normal understanding of reality, but very shaken by the experience. I don&#039;t remember many details here, I rolled around on the floor, throwing glow-in-the-dark snowflakes like shurikens through the air. Then I found a large cuddly toy tiger and pounced my friends with it.<br /><br />Later I had another similar experience with N2O (I had many small trips with it, but they where nowhere near as interesting). As I exhaled the gas, I felt as if I was transported through the various people in the party, with everyone repeating the same phrase over and over and over for... Eternity I suppose (I really wish I could remember this phrase). And at the same time I saw this happening from my own eyes, and the loop would continue unless I created an instance of resistance to the flow of impressions; an ego. This ego I created by asking a simple question (to the same person as earlier): &quot;Does it all start with a question?&quot; The conversation that followed was very weird, indeed :D<br /><br />Afterwards I got my sketchbook and though to sketch a bit on the comedown, but all these trippers went wild and stole it, looking at my pictures, then starting to draw in it themselves instead. So my friend asked me if I wanted to try some changa. Fuck yeah.<br /><br />We loaded the pipe and bejeezuz, that stuff does smell. My friend went first, then I tried it (it was my first time with DMT). Three continuous tokes of this plastic-smelling bark (1/3 DMT according to my friend). If normal vision was at a hundred FPS, then this was at 10 000 FPS. My fingers moved impossibly smooth through the air, patterns, and streaks of light moved through all objects, even though sound and music where there, it all felt so very silent and tranquil. Whilst I moved my fingers in front of my hands I could see the intricate workings of the bodily systems, and how particles of light flowed through them, protecting them? It passed rather quickly, and the owner of the apartment didn&#039;t want us to smoke anymore because of the smell.<br /><br />The rest of the night we discussed the possibilities of time travel, perhaps within the confines of one trip. If it was possible to have an experience backwards and such.<br /><br />One of the best nights ever, hope you enjoyed the report and would be very interested in hearing your thoughts :)

				Was watching TED videos last night, and came acros this video of Jill Bolte Taylor. She talks about her experience of having a stroke.<br /><br />I was stunned to find out her experience is almost identical as my experience on an lsd trip I had a while ago..!&nbsp; The silence in the mind, the loss of identification with the body, the expansive consiousness, the loss of the ego which resulted in a total freedom from emotional bagage, and the intence feeling of bliss. For me it was the most liborating thing I ever experienced, it radicaly changed the way I look at my being. Thank you lsd, to let me experience this without having a stroke ;)<br /><br />Recommended video! Clearnet link;<br />http://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html

Its a disgrace on so many levels. Unfortunately, there will always be people out there passing off that gabage as L. Makes me very sad.<br /><br />About this &#039;strawberry&#039; crystal.. whos the vendor, if you dont mind my asking. I know that Googleeyed was selling some xtal a while back, that was labeled &quot;rose xtal&quot;..presumably from the pink hue it had. I know a few members made that purchase, and did not have any complaints about it, though, i cant say i actually recall any real reviews attesting to its quality. Atop that, Ive heard whispers of&nbsp; &quot;rose xtal&quot; laid blotters, at various music festivals, for 500 USD per sheet. <br /><br />I havnt checked out that strange listing you mention, but im almost 100% that MarioBros, the vendor, is not legit. I cant back that entirely at the moment, but im sure ive heard nothing good, or even neutral, about them. <br /><br />Much love Raf 8)

JCow can likely supply your demand, and has bomb tabs all the time, for excellent prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;There is lots of other vendors that offer sheets, i dont know what would be considered &#039;bulk&#039; for you. If your talking a sheet or two, then theres Tess, Subtickle and Jannis also.

If you start thinking about what &quot;ordinary&quot; is, you won&#039;t be it. I am totally fine tripping around my parents and did it in my teens no problem, but I am very sure that I am an anomaly. I actually feel more like myself when I am tripping. <br /><br />Back to the question. If you are interested in tripping, rather than using the chemical as medication, I would totally recommend against &quot;microdosing.&quot;. I would take about 150ug. Anywhere in the 125-200ug. I recommend this to first timers. The first time you take LSD, it should be an astoundingly awe-inspiring experience that almost comes as a surprise that something that amazing could and does exist. You will not reach this with a microdose. <br /><br />If you go with it, nothing but great things will happen to you -- or better put, you will make great things happen. Because you are the pilot of the experience, and if you fly into stormy weather, it&#039;s because you navigated yourself there, not the plane. <br /><br />My advice: wait until you have the right setting as well as mindset. No parents. I would also recommend against a trip sitter. They are wholly unnecessary things that more times than not are a drag on the experience. For getting the most out of a trip, always go it alone. <br /><br />And if you didn&#039;t know already, nature is the best setting. Oh, and like incogmagnito said, definitely, definitely dedicate a full day to it. Dose at like 2 PM and you&#039;ll go to sleep at the end.

				/\ Interesting...<br /><br />Pretty much every time i dose, I pop .5-1.0mg of xanax just a few minutes after dropping the L. I find this makes my come up virtually non-existent. <br /><br />As for the speed, ive had some meth still running semi-strong in my blood when ive dosed L in the past. I found that it was not very pleasant for me, as it was basically just that very anxious, nervous, speedy come up feel, that lasted more than the usual 1-2hrs of the L come up. Ups isnt my bag, never has been. Unless i cap up a few mgs of meth for productivity purposes, usually for work. Much love guys.

If you start thinking about what &quot;ordinary&quot; is, you won&#039;t be it. I am totally fine tripping around my parents and did it in my teens no problem, but I am very sure that I am an anomaly. I actually feel more like myself when I am tripping. <br /><br />Back to the question. If you are interested in tripping, rather than using the chemical as medication, I would totally recommend against &quot;microdosing.&quot;. I would take about 150ug. Anywhere in the 125-200ug. I recommend this to first timers. The first time you take LSD, it should be an astoundingly awe-inspiring experience that almost comes as a surprise that something that amazing could and does exist. You will not reach this with a microdose. <br /><br />If you go with it, nothing but great things will happen to you -- or better put, you will make great things happen. Because you are the pilot of the experience, and if you fly into stormy weather, it&#039;s because you navigated yourself there, not the plane. <br /><br />My advice: wait until you have the right setting as well as mindset. No parents. I would also recommend against a trip sitter. They are wholly unnecessary things that more times than not are a drag on the experience. For getting the most out of a trip, always go it alone. <br /><br />And if you didn&#039;t know already, nature is the best setting. Oh, and like incogmagnito said, definitely, definitely dedicate a full day to it. Dose at like 2 PM and you&#039;ll go to sleep at the end. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />@DMTisinME, I second everything bar doing one&#039;s first trip on L without a sitter.<br />When one knows oneself well including doses tripping alone is great, but on the first go to have a wing man is a great idea ... And then return them a favour :-)<br />For a wing man it might be good to read T. Leary&#039;s &quot;Psychedelic Experience&quot; just to know their function - no need to memorise all of those texts they use, but to know that it is all about providing calming support if needed is all that matters.

				Yeah, I admit it it&#039;d be good to have company, but I would recommend for the first time having a friend or two with you who are also tripping. The first time I did it I was with a great friend, and my brother. The energy in the air was full of awe since it was all three of our first times. <br /><br />You&#039;ll want to discuss what you&#039;re feeling/experiencing, and you can&#039;t do that with a sober sitter. (It&#039;s all one way)<br /><br />I am not wholly against trip sitters, only uneducated ones. <br /><br />EDIT: Also, shortly after posting this, I got my first negative karma since November. Noooooooo!! ....... Ok, I&#039;m over it.

				yeah the first few times i did psychedelics i had that true ego loss.<br /><br />i say &quot;true&quot; because i didnt know of any methods to guide the experience, other than my close friend telling me to &quot;let it show me what it wants to show me&quot; and the voice of the mushrooms themselves telling me &quot;all you are is a thought in continuation of itself, you are dreaming. all you have to do to die is let go of all thought/action.<br /><br />but after then, i&#039;ve found that i get so much deeper into repressed memories and who I am when i trip by myself.<br /><br />and there is also the common problem of having people around and finally seeing peoples intentions behind there statements (this can be very rough territory on high doses)

				What would you say is the most significant change in yourself because of taking LSD?&nbsp; How has it incorporated into your daily life and your personality or your values?&nbsp; Was it difficult to incorporate it from the trip?<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear from anyone here.

In a technical manner of speaking, I was probably correct to be uncertain. Skepticism is, after all, a scientist’s best friend. After taking LSD, doubt was thrown out of the window. I was certain of what I wanted in my life, and blessed by the chemical with the renewed passion to get myself there. More than that, I realized I already was there, and always would be. Nothing could take my happiness away from me. Before taking LSD, happiness and I were together in a loose kind of way – if we were shaken up we separated. After taking LSD, we were bonded eternally. I had an epiphany hours into my first dose ever, “I’m the happiest person in [town] and nobody knows it!” I finally apprehended how happy, I should be, how happy I was, and have remained since.&quot;

Pissed again there yesterday and was surprised at how normal the wall looked -- I thought the paint must have dried in a scale like fashion, but there was nothing remotely there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=84848.msg1044314#msg1044314">Quote from: incogmagnito on April 23, 2013, 05:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My absolute favourites are trees, clouds, swell and sand on a beach.<br />Everything is breathing like nature intended when you are sober.

And then I died! And it restarted again ... still with me, but with a slightly different life. And then I died again ... and again ... and again ... and again ... And then I lost trace of where I came from and links of previous lives and gave up to ever finding my way back to some body lying somewhere ... all of this while continuing to die so frequently that even hord of lemmings would not be able to repeat this feat. I died so many times and got so bored with it that I realised that ego-death is not a stage or phase or even mile stone to spend an extra second on ... it is like a blurry tree in an eye of a kid staring out of a car at full speed. When I came back I realised that my question &quot;what is beyond death?&quot; was simply silly.<br /><br />So, hence my advice to be prepared to get bored with dying ... It does not make the horror of the first 50 or so any lower though

				I totally agree with the whole K inducing and ego loss trip.. 100%!<br /><br />Did it the other day, only 300ug or so of L, then like a mountain of the kitkit, like .6. Once that drip went down, it was total ego death, for a few min at a time, or what seemed like a few min anyway, then id come to, and die again, and so on..<br /><br />Moral is, snort K when on L!

I had not taken any psychedelics for the past 22 days. <br /><br />Time: 6:00 PM<br />Dose: 4 mayan calandars<br />Vendor: albionessentialols<br /><br />After taking them, I began to finish up some things I needed done and my friend, who ate 5 yellow gandalfs from jerseycow helped me out. This lasted until I began to feel them faintly, which was after about a half hour. We then began to walk around my backyard aimlessly, just talking, until tracers began forming and the LSD began seeping into my mind nicely. We then laid down in some outdoor lounge chairs, which I felt like I was melting nicely into. My muscles began to glow warm and euphorically – it felt too good to move. I took in the sights of the tree’s – which looked oddly pointy and blocky, like green confetti – and the sky, which was full of clouds that were flying by at an abnormal speed. They looked more like objects than normal, but nothing to speak about. At about T+1:15, I was keenly aware of very detailed fractals that filled my vision. <br /><br />A bit later, we went back inside, mostly because we wanted to hear some music, and settled on playing some ping pong, as the immobilizing aspect of the come-up had mostly worn off. The games were very close – they usually are on acid – and we were thoroughly enjoying ourselves at this point. It’s worth noting that inside was more a wash of colors vs. the splintered fractals of outside. The breathing of everything was much more noticeable. <br /><br />We then lounged inside and talked about our pasts and futures and perceptions, etc., while listening to good music. Putting thoughts to words was a challenge at times, but nothing out of the ordinary for a large dose. <br /><br />At about T+4:00, we began to have an impromptu exercise session, which felt very, very good. After the grogginess of the come-up wears off, I am always left extremely nimble and full of energy. Putting this energy to use was quite pleasurable. <br /><br />At T+4:45, we went outside, where there was a thunder and lightning storm happening without rain. It was quite the event for us. We laid on my back patio and stared straight up. The sky was kind of glowing from behind the clouds. I assume it would have been a very bright night if it wasn’t so cloudy. At first as I looked up I could see a rainbow colored chain link spread circularly across the sky. This is a staple of the visual aspect of a high dose LSD trip for me. It flowed around and changed shape and color before turning into a swirl of 60’s acid inspired type graffiti writing written in the sky. I could not read what it said, but it was fascinating. This then began to turn into a very, very vivid mayan (or other south American native) art display. It was fully detailed and constantly moving across my field of vision. This lasted for quite a bit of time, and I was blown away. <br /><br />Sometime later, we went for a walk 10 minute walk down the street and a surge would run through me after each time lightning would strike in the distance and the entire world would light up. It was invigorating. <br /><br />We then went back inside and watched some of Mr. Show, which I had previously watched the last time had taken acid. The humor of that show matches LSD quite well. It’s a great show, and terrific fun on LSD. <br /><br />At T+8:15, my friend decided to go to bed after giving two thumbs up for the yellow gandalfs. As I was going to my bed, I saw that the storm was full on now, and decided that I was not quite tired and sat out on my front porch. Here I reflected on the decisions I had made the last few weeks and whether they were the right ones. Heavy rain always soothes me and did so here and the thunder and lightning added some theatrics. Being somewhat outside myself, the objectivity came very easily, and the reflection will likely prove to be life-enhancing. <br /><br />These tabs are top notch and took me on a visually packed and mentally and emotionally fulfilling experience. <br /><br />Thanks albion. Thanks SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Slirp, by the way, your vasoconstriction theory I have dismissed off hand before could be totally sound. Apologies for that. Especially on high doses both LSD and other ergot derivatives can become rather noticeable. You must be very very very body aware - respect!

				I&#039;ve heard that smoking weed brings more visuals out in an LSD trip.&nbsp; I don&#039;t smoke weed but wondering if 5f-ur144 might do similar.

Ive some to learn that all the visuals from really clean L are always right in front of your eyes, even if you dont think you have any. Its kind of hard to describe. I had this convo with a friend last time we tripped. We had done shrooms the night before and on 4 drops of JORs TOC, he said he had ZERO visuals. I on the other hand, had loads of amazing OEV.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I figured out a way to force his eyes to focus on the visuals and not what his eyes where actually seeing in front of him. I told him to go stand right in front of a brick wall. like point blank, nose to the wall, eyes wide open but not to focus in on the brick, just stare at the wall as if it was a window and your looking out it into the distance. With in less than 30 seconds, &quot;Ohhh shitt! yoo crazy rainbow kaleidoscopes, everywhere!&quot;. LOL<br /><br />&nbsp;You just have to learn to tune your eyes in so to speak.

				GoodShitExplorer that is interesting you get better visuals from the 2C-B than LSD.&nbsp; I&#039;ve probably experienced the same.&nbsp; People say that the 25x-NBOMe visuals are more artificial than LSD but I haven&#039;t heard much about 2C-B artificial vs lifelike.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had them both ways with 2C-B (different trips).&nbsp; Maybe with LSD in my system still it&#039;ll be more life-like visuals.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to experiment.<br /><br />My 2C-B disappears faster than it should.&nbsp; Such a fine powder.&nbsp; I need for BlueViking to get more or for another US domestic vendor to start offering 1g for under $100 again.

				Do you guys think there will be any trouble with JoR&#039;s LOTUS of TOC vials suffering heat damage while being shipped to the states from the UK?

				Hey guys,<br /><br />as lsd sharpens all senses i wonder if there is a LSD ritual where people get to ticle their senses?<br /><br />I cant imagine hippys back in the days didnt figure something like this...&nbsp; This could lead into people using and enjoying their senses more, thus enjoying life more.<br /><br />&nbsp;I had such an experience the last time on LSD when i had 1g of 5 different very sick weed strains. I have NEVER in my life smelled anything that intense. And since then i think in a different way of smelling. If i smell something i explore it. Let my sense study the smell. When before i smelled something i didnt think about it. Yer, it just smelled like &#039;that&#039;. But i didnt explore anything furthermore.. I kinda learned to enjoy and explore smellings. When before i only smelled.<br /><br />Now i think i would like something like that for all my other senses too! In most cases this could lead into a better living overall. The only downside of which i could think of is when the senses for pain get sharpened too, which i think they will! <br /><br /><br />Anyway, if somebody heared of something like that please let me know! i am very interested.<br /><br />And if there is nothing like it yet, i think its the task of the lsd avengers to create it! :D<br /><br /><br />Sight: (like looking at special pics that can inspire you, or something that could lead u feeling like laying on a beach or something. I personally have a nice desktop picture from a city in the US with a skyline and lots of light. I once sat there 2 hours looking at it enjoying it more than any action movie i can think of. I was almost able to look in each window. It looked like everything was alive. The sky looked like it was moving. At no time the picture looked the same. Everywhere i looked it seemed there was something up. While exploring and enjoying this picture there came very cool thoughts, good ideas for the future and whatnot)<br /><br />Hearing: ( Music, obviously enjoyed differently by everyone. But the last time i took 2 drops TOC for a mild trip, i explored youtube a whole night. I found some very sick stuff probably created for Trippers. Look at this while tripping: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swj_1uhAeW4<br />Take ur time for it. Let ur soul fly and look at this black art like thing. Man! The music is changing the colors of this thing!!!!! I couldnt get over it.... And the whole thing is called &#039;Alle Farben&#039; in english &#039;All colors&#039;. <br />Then there was another sensation i had from music, im not sure but it could very well be that &#039;Alle Farben&#039; aswell. That was that the music was playing with my feelings! Really sick, i felt so bad at some point and i figured it was because of the music, so i wanted to change it, but then the music became even better than before to make my feelings go upward like i barely ever experienced. I think the music was made specially for that. If u feel good from the music and it is already getting boring because it is good all the way, the music makes u feel bad, just to gain even more joy when it becomes good again. Then it makes u feel bored and all kind of stuff like that. This is music playing with ur senses and feelings. Gorgeous if u ask me.<br /><br />Taste: That is something i have not much experience with. I have yet to eat fruit while tripping. I ate a banana once but cant remember anything special at it. I have to add im no great fruit eater too. What i did experience tho was when i ate jellybabys. Usually i just take a pack, put them in my mouth and swallow asap. On lsd i was able to explore every single taste of it to infinity. Even different states of taste. When i put them in my mouth i taste it, and the longer i hold it in and concentrate on it, the stronger the&nbsp; taste becomes<br /><br />Smell: i have explained at the start of this post<br /><br />Touch: pain that is for example. Testing different states of pain, not to enjoy but to explore. Also i have yet to have a sexual experience. I was thinking about tripping with a girl alone. Take a hotel room, some acid and then enjoy eachothers body for the full trip. Like getting naked and stay like that for the hole trip being and do whatever u want.<br />The only downside to the sex thing is that my gf dont do drugs at all. And i would never get her to take lsd. That was the first time of my life that i thought about cheating. I already got an ex gf of mine ready for that, she was willing to do it with me. But after thinking about it more deeply i came to the conclusion that i cant do this to my gf. She just doesnt deserve that. Im pretty sure i wouldnt be able to sleep well anymore from there on out. So i cut this out for me :( I will probably just trip myself and try to enjoy it that way. She made a good sitter when i took xtc after years of break. Was almost like she were rolling herself :D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So guys, if u have ever read something about such a ritual/procedure please let me know. Im very interested in stuff like that.<br /><br />Have a great life! :D

				I had quite some different locations already. Once i was in the wood at night. Once we took a walk through it at day time. More often we just chill together, hear music, talk about things. We figured the trip is way more mellow at day time. So we usually start in the evening.<br /><br />Well i gotta add i did not have the balls for such a big dose yet. The most i took was 4-5 drops of the TOC. Usually i aim at ~180ug.<br /><br />Anyway, yet we did it together only for fun and not to explore it more deeply. I figured there is way more possible with it if i explore it alone, meditate on it. Or if i do special things with it. Like the last time with those 5 different weed strains. It was hilarious! Way more special to me than anyone of u can imagine! It was like i have smelled something for REAL for the first time in my life! I explored these smelling senses the whole trip with 5 different, very sick, strains of weed. For me as a weed lover that was one of the nicest experiences i have had with L! Outstanding to say the least! :D<br /><br />I would really like to get a Ritual going to explore all other senses that way too! Nobody ever heared of anything like that?<br /><br />The Burning Man seems cool. Tho i cant afford to go anywhere near such places. Also i cant hear Rock Music. There would be a great chance of bad mood with that kind of music.<br /><br />maybe i will just make a thread for it and see what other guys found to be very cool experiences.

				Oh your trip report is super cool and i enjoyed reading it a lot! But it is not exactly what i was looking for.<br /><br />I was rather thinking of a &#039;real&#039; ritual, like lining up a bunch of fruits and sharp(chilli) things, sour things, sweet etc for the tasting sensation, lining up all kinds of weed (or for none - weed - smokers something else) for the smelling sensation, some special mind altering music that possibly lets u taste what u hear (maybe also sends u on some sick journeys), some special tasks u have to accomplish to get different kind of &#039;WOW&#039; effects and stuff like that.<br /><br />

				yes im thinking to do that obviously. But i would much rather take other experiences with that, maybe already &#039;perfected&#039; ones, and explore them, rather than to find a special one myself. That would save me time and brain cells :D But i am going to do it either way.

				I&#039;m going to try and stay on topic.&nbsp; I have eaten LSD 70-80x, mostly multiple doses, with holidays, and have taken psilocybes 40-50x, never done most tryptamines, nBOMe, or psychedelic PEAs, except MDMA.&nbsp; I have experienced extreme ego death to the point to the point that I&#039;ve questioned the existence of everything I hold sacred.<br />&nbsp; OK, CEVs and senses seem to be what is the topic of the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I almost consider CEVs to be background, for instance, if you look at the night sky when you are post-peak, you will see patterns of various kinds, now, if you change your thinking by a bit, you will find that these patterns roughly change with changes in your thinking process.&nbsp; This may not be apparent, if you are seriously intoxicated by the trip, it will seem like your jacked-up subconscious is just running away from you, like a train, but this is your 3rd eye, it gets tired, just like your regular vision centers, so it wallpapers blank canvasses to satisfy the brain&#039;s need for a coherent image.&nbsp; I often see flowers, peace signs, rotating cubes, circles, various mandalas and other repeating patterns.&nbsp; These are roughly what my CEVs look like, the main difference being that with closed eyes, you can focus a CEV into a &#039;movie&#039; playing in your head, because your eyes don&#039;t have to work, you are freed to see only through the 3rd eye.&nbsp; These images can be almost anything, you might even just think you are dreaming or thinking out loud, but you are actually seeing your thoughts.&nbsp; This is a difficult thing for people to get their head around, but we&#039;ve done experiments on this kind of thing, and has been reproduced.&nbsp; OEVs, aside from tracers/wiggles/lines/distortions, are not always seen by everyone.&nbsp; I always say that you haven&#039;t tripped until you&#039;ve seen an OEV.&nbsp; This is an oversimplification, but you need to get deep enough into the experience to get them, it will not happen unless you can let go completely.&nbsp; It might, but it might not.&nbsp; Some people are probably incapable of having OEVs, such people will manifest the visions back into thoughts, and find themselves completely lost, and will think they are going crazy.&nbsp; The cross-over to the controlled-visual stage from the peak, is a turning point of sorts.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have peaked hard enough, you will(or should) still get visions for another 6-8hr or longer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, as far as senses go, I recommend drinking tea, beer, orange juice, liquor, etc.&nbsp; I cannot put into words how good a sip of budweiser tasted on my last LSD trip, it was insanely good, the hops tasted like weed, i could taste the malted barley, like an entire field of wheat had entered my mouth.&nbsp; Pretty much anything you like normally, you will love.&nbsp; Usually, I just eat bread and juice on acid, I view it as a cleansing experience, and I don&#039;t want to contaminate it with meat or weird foods that could make me barf.&nbsp; This brings me to the next point, motion sickness.&nbsp; You can puke your guts out on LSD from a bumpy car ride, especially at night.&nbsp; It only happened once to me, but don&#039;t say I didn&#039;t warn you.

How your LSD experienced has effected that belief system?<br /><br />3. What do you mean by mysticism and what was your experience like of it?<br /><br /><br />Curiously,<br />GSE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;ll gladly answer those questions.<br /><br />1. I was not born into a religious household. I honestly did not know much about world religions until I started reading about them when I was 12, and because of this I based my knowledge in sciences and evidence. I did not believe there was a god, creator, supreme being etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />2&amp;3. The experience on the combination of LSD and P.Cubensis shrooms seriously short circuited me. I had no idea that the tabs I was taking were 2 or 3 times as strong as the tabs I had been taking from my source. I was usually dealing with 50-70 ug hits but later found out after taking one 6 months later that they were somewhere in the 140-170 range. (This was based on 40 or 50 trips I had under my belt at the time). As for the experience itself I felt the effects in 15 minutes. I literally felt an urge to go to the restroom and relieve all bodily functions because I felt as if I was going to die. As I returned to the bedroom i laid down listening to music and thats when I was sent into a dark space. This all happened 1.2 hours into the trip. I had just started feeling the mushrooms make its way into the blood stream and the ascent to the peak of the lsd trip was coming. I slipped into complete darkness and felt my self floating. I was no longer in my body and my mind was telling me to let go, I had died why was I clinging just enjoy the ride to the other side. The minute I let go I felt the warmest purest form of love I had ever felt. I wasn&#039;t present anywhere but felt that I was everywhere at the exact same time. I felt as if I was basking in the glory of something that provided unconditional love (The universe, God, Allah, Jesus, universal consciousness etc). On my way down from the trip (which lasted nearly 16 hours) I did not regain any real control of bodily movements until 7 hours into the trip and the shrooms had worn off. I did not know my name, did not understand where I was, who I was, or what I was. I sat on the floor of my bedroom and meditated for several hours. Surely after a few bowls of cannabis I started to remember my name, the people around me and the names of objects and the knowledge I had felt I lost.<br /><br />Since that day I have been spreading love and harmony. I understand that I have emotions and that I react to situations, but it felt as if the past had been wiped clean. I called everyone I ever felt I wronged and apologized and told them what I really felt about them: &quot;Everyone has the ability and capacity to do either whatever it is they choose and that is one&#039;s choice. I was just glad for the seconds that they were in my life and I hoped for success and happiness in each of their lives. I was sorry for anything that ever hurt them or offended them.&quot; Its been 3 years since that experience and to this day roughly once in 2 or 3 months I will send them messages telling them that they&#039;re still dear to me. <br /><br />It was the highest form of ego death. I couldn&#039;t even hold on really after the 1 hour mark it was useless to hold on. I understood that the trip was all created by my consciousness but it really made me wonder whether or not there was a supreme being out there. That trip really felt like it put me at its feet. I guess it made me believe there is a creator just not one assigned to a religion. The experience to this day still makes me smile with curiosity as to what part of this &#039;other&#039; reality is real.

Its honestly hard to describe the hallucinations that I was being shown. One of them felt as if I was staring at my body watching it die until my bones eroded.

Eventually the sun died out and everything went dark. <br /><br />I must say that psychedelics are an interesting drug. I&#039;ve had the pleasure of enjoying psychedelics quite a lot.

It doesn&#039;t take that long to get to be able to communicate that well, just a few months ago I was tripping with a friend I have known very well for about 5 years and we were both on rather high doses and I was trying to say something (can&#039;t remember what) and I couldn&#039;t articulate it at all. He just blurted out, &quot;shut up man, I know exactly what your trying to say.&quot; It was very true and made me laugh really hard. Just one example of countless. <br /><br />I do find that when tripping with my brother, we just don&#039;t even need to speak usually, but sometimes we&#039;ll reminisce on our childhood while tripping and it will all flood back to us. It is a truly beautiful thing when it happens.&nbsp;

				Interesting developments here, indeed. Enjoyable read.<br /><br />From my experience the most impactful and almost seminal trips are actually on high doses.<br /><br />I feel that Terence McKenna was right when he said that one needs to take high doses rarely rather than trip frequently.<br /><br />I have never been done mg+ of LSD, but got to 700ug + 500mg of ketamine insufflated, which ended up being my most &quot;mystical&quot; experience. I bet everyone here has such a crown jewel in their collection of life experiences.<br /><br />To say that I have gone thru ego death is not to say a thing - my time was suspended and I continued dying for an eternity until that-what-perceived-me then got bored with being a subject of experience and moved to play both roles - object and subject - creator and experiencer. That trip made me believe that there is no higher deity that is separate from us - we are it and it is us, there is no separation of anything from anything and all the existence is one continuous flow of energy. There is no death and birth in a sense of end and beginning, but simple perpetual energy transformation. Despite trying on a couple of occasions I was never able again to enter a state where a dichotomy of observer and observed was so broken and yet working so well, but I do continue seeking it.<br /><br />On a rational front my recent experiences and immense amount of research have led to an ineteresting series of thoughts:<br />- since psychedelics change our &quot;reality&quot; perception by binding themselves to serotonin and dopamine receptors one can conclude that we are all biorobots tripping non-stop on serotonin and dopamine<br />- when it comes to &quot;reality&quot; what we have is a consensus view of serotonin-dopamine induced trips<br />- the consensus view requires communication and we are seriously struggling to verbalise our experiences at the best of times and here we are constantly high!<br /><br />What could happen to our reality if, say a slight modification to atmosphere or water was to occur and serotonin was to be ever so slightly modified? would we be talking about objective realities and truths if we were to realise that someone has just switched a channel that we all are watching? ;-)

				Dear fellow trippers:<br /><br />I have the set and setting for my next trip (thanks in part to wise words from GSE in another thread) taken care of. I have started fasting last night and will be continuing through tomorrow until Jackie&#039;s wow comes in the mail. I&#039;m looking to dose high-medium to low-hard. The only thing I need to know is relative strength of these tabs compared to Jersey Cow&#039;s green/olive and yellow bordered Gandalfs. I took 5 and had a relatively great experience. I&#039;m thinking of possibly dropping anywhere from 5-7. I want to push the boundaries a bit before work and school come into play on Wednesday. Any feedback will be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />general rundown: <br />1. This will be a solo trip<br />2. I will be tripping at home as it has been 100 and a beautiful hike sounds perfect toward the tail end.<br />3. Allan Watts lectures, Sounds of nature, and a few Pink Floyd and Grateful Dead albums synced on computer and phone.<br /><br />Thank for the help!<br />Happy and safe tripping to all!<br />WiB<br />

				I&#039;ve never used shrooms but would like to get my feet wet but also don&#039;t want to waste my opportunity to do drugs with just a light dose of shrooms.&nbsp; Anyone see the harm in adding a small dose of shrooms to an LSD trip?&nbsp; The idea is to test my reaction to the shrooms (eg upset stomach) and maybe get more fucked up (which I like).

No they were not.&nbsp; 150ug I ingested 5 ~90-110ug hits. Not too sure of the dosage but with the set and setting I setup for myself it felt more like the 700-800ug range. If you are going to trip alone (harder dosage) just make sure you keep the fact that it is LSD and the effects will eventually wear off.

				Weeks ago I made two batches of tea from 11 grams of p. galindoi which I split with someone else.&nbsp; The first few hours was fine but after that I was nauseated and spent a lot of time on the toilet.&nbsp; The duration was way to short.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll stick with 2Cs and LSD from now on.&nbsp; If I&#039;m going to use a triptamine then I&#039;ll stick with a pure chemical... I&#039;ve got 5-meo-mipt right now.<br /><br />Maybe I wouldn&#039;t get nauseated if I didn&#039;t eat anything for many hours before the trip but I&#039;ve gotta eat.

				Has anyone ever meditated on LSD before?<br /><br />Yearrs ago I had taken a break from LSD for almost a year to experiment with mushrooms. One night, to break this tolerance I decided to eat some hits with my good friends when I had gotten off of my night shift. I acquired some Rolling Stones blotters locally that had built up quite a reputation, at this point (and still really) most of the good LSD was White on White fluff. <br /><br />At one point in the night after having eaten two hits, I needed to go off on my own for a minute, something I usually do whilst peaking on LSD. I went to his room and sat on the floor and tried to meditate, which really was one of the first times I&#039;d ever seriously tried meditating. I knew some simple breathing techniques just from some psychology books I&#039;ve read. <br /><br />The experience was one of the most intensely psychedelic things I&#039;ve gone through on LSD. It was quite similar to breaking through on DMT. <br />I closed my eyes and surrendered to the darkness and focused on my breathing, feeling my lungs expand and release. All of a sudden there was a strange ringing (again something that usually happens to me on DMT) and I could no longer here my friends watching t.v. in the other room, as I was in another realm, what felt like some strange purgatory. As I began to feel myself melting and dissolving I also felt what I can only describe as more arms grew out of my shoulder. It was almost as if I felt like my own Hindu god achieving nirvana.<br /><br />It was intense, felt very transcendental and spiritual. Shit I think I was only like 16-17 at the time.

				My entire life I&#039;ve never understood how people can enjoy sitting silently while staying awake and that they&#039;d rather do that than something else.&nbsp; But LSD has definitely made me reconsider.<br /><br />With sensory deprivation one can get psychedelic effects.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s what those silent monks are doing up in the cold mountains of China.

I was thinking of that today, how intense CEV/OEVs are impossible to ignore, like the scene in A Clockwork Orange, where they keep his eyelids open! ah, the memories...

				Good to see this thread revived and DB being back from his troubles. Hope it was nothing long-term damaging, DB!<br /><br />I am not sure where to post this and this thread does seem to have the best group to ask :)<br /><br />Say, if I wanted to have a psychedelic long weekend - 3 days of tripping ... In what order and what doses would I arrange my substances in to have maximum good time.<br /><br />I have ideas for the first two:<br />Day 1: Pharmahuasca - moclobemide (15omg) + DMT fumerate or DMT phosphate (100 to 150mg) with an opportunity to top-up with smoked DMT freebase to make a complete (albeit temporary) departure into the hyperspace. While smoking while on MAOI is for an adventurous type just pharmahuasca is an amazing and great experience while being fully mobile and almost functional ;-)<br /><br />Day 2: Since DMT does not really fry any receptors long-term and moclobemide is RIMA and gets out of the system very quickly one can do this regimen - LSD + 2CB + MDMA/MDA + GHB - doses vary depending on natural tolerances and weights, BUT this combo pretty much fries everything there is to fry ... <br /><br />so what could be an idea for Day 3? Or may be I should change Day 2?<br /><br />I came across this list of receptor affinities by substance to help me, but not being the sharpest tool in the box I do fail to draw some conclusions. May be you, ladies and gents, can help?<br /><br />What I know is that the higher the number the higher the affinity and stronger this receptor is &quot;fried&quot; by the substance. The list is long, but I think you should see it in full. For brainiacs out there could help to put together a minimum-interaction multi-day regimen:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">6-F-DMT: 4.00 5ht6, 3.93 5ht2b, 3.80 5ht7, 3.74 H1, 3.66 5ht1d, 3.25 SERT, 3.24 Alpha2C, 3.17 Alpha1A, 3.07 5ht1b, 2.99 Alpha2B, 2.81 5ht1a, 2.74 5ht1e, 2.67 D1, 2.62 D2, 2.58 5ht2c, 2.47 5ht2a, 2.47 D3, 2.45 Imidazoline1, 2.44 H2, 2.43 5ht5a, 2.25 D4, 1.61 D5, 1.57 Sigma1, 1.56 Sigma2;

Hope it was nothing long-term damaging, DB!<br /><br />I am not sure where to post this and this thread does seem to have the best group to ask :)<br /><br />Say, if I wanted to have a psychedelic long weekend - 3 days of tripping ... In what order and what doses would I arrange my substances in to have maximum good time.<br /><br />I have ideas for the first two:<br />Day 1: Pharmahuasca - moclobemide (15omg) + DMT fumerate or DMT phosphate (100 to 150mg) with an opportunity to top-up with smoked DMT freebase to make a complete (albeit temporary) departure into the hyperspace. While smoking while on MAOI is for an adventurous type just pharmahuasca is an amazing and great experience while being fully mobile and almost functional ;-)<br /><br />Day 2: Since DMT does not really fry any receptors long-term and moclobemide is RIMA and gets out of the system very quickly one can do this regimen - LSD + 2CB + MDMA/MDA + GHB - doses vary depending on natural tolerances and weights, BUT this combo pretty much fries everything there is to fry ... <br /><br />so what could be an idea for Day 3? Or may be I should change Day 2?<br /><br />I came across this list of receptor affinities by substance to help me, but not being the sharpest tool in the box I do fail to draw some conclusions. May be you, ladies and gents, can help?<br /><br />What I know is that the higher the number the higher the affinity and stronger this receptor is &quot;fried&quot; by the substance. The list is long, but I think you should see it in full.

				@ incogmagnito: I haven&#039;t gone threw your whole list up there... but I know I&#039;ve spend 3 days weekends tripping on combo&#039;s of LSD, mushrooms, amphetamine (keeps you awake, seems to also boost the LSD experience and after being awake for 3 days without food you don&#039;t need much more to hallucinate) and lots of marihuana. <br />A combo with mescaline, ketamine and possibly DMT might do wonders - but I didn&#039;t have access to those at that time so I haven&#039;t tried it myself.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a reminder, with regards to the Nichols &#039;psychedelic binding affinity&#039; chart.&nbsp; &nbsp;It omits some duplicate results, for instance, it doesn&#039;t mention SS-2c being active at HT1d(very much so, 2.4nM, still a wonderful drug though).&nbsp; There is a certain &#039;balance&#039; to every drug event which triggers the experience, biochemically speaking.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had it explained to me in the following way:&nbsp; There is a target, like a bulls-eye, and let&#039;s say you are an Archer, the tricky thing is, you are trying to hit at least 4 or 5 targets, including the &quot;master target&quot; while ever-so-slightly missing the bullseye on every target, with the more targets hit in this way, the better.&nbsp; Sure you could go for a full-on agonist at the 5HT2a receptor, the consumate &#039;psychedelic&#039; receptor, but you&#039;ll find most drugs that are popular tend to be full agonists at the adjacent channels like HT2b/c and HT1a/b.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There is also a feedback-loop where HT2 receptors potentate dopamine receptors, wherein you get the &#039;crazy&#039; &#039;euphoric&#039; and &#039;rushing&#039; aspects which shake up the experience, along with the adrenal receptors at the alpha and beta sites.&nbsp; The analogy to entering a several-digit long code to enter a door, is another one I like, the necessary charge required to open up a flood from the calcium and phosphine channels is essentially an entry code, and the drug is the key.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that LSD and similar drugs are so popular, is because there is a delicate balance between activation of <br /><br />LSD: 4.00 5ht1b, 3.77 5ht7, 3.75 5ht6, 3.73 5ht1a, 3.70 5ht1d, 3.64 5ht5a, 3.54 5ht2a, 3.16 D3, 3.11 5ht2b, 3.11 5ht2c, 2.93 Alpha2A, 2.62 5ht1e, 2.55 D2, 2.39 D4, 2.34 D1, 2.05 D5, 1.54 Alpha1A, 1.40 H1, 1.39 Beta1, 1.05 Beta2, 0.65 Alpha1B;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; at least 9 receptors as a strong agonist, and another 5 as partial agonist, 4/5 of those are dopamine receptors, with some weak activity at adrenal receptors as well.&nbsp; These often overlooked dopamine receptors come into play after the HT2 activation sensitizes them, so the chart can be difficult to read as-is.&nbsp; I still find it incredibly helpful, I just thought that we should stay on topic, which is LSD here.&nbsp; A major reason why ergoloid analogues have been so popular, I postulate, is because of decreased activity at the dopamine sites from the onset, which makes for less of the &#039;mindfuck&#039; later.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which brings about the subject of 13-OH-LSD being a dopamine agonist and the 4-hour &#039;twilight zone&#039; where the dark aspects tend to come out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always said I never entered a trip and exited without some kind of difficulty at this mark, more of a slight insanity which creeps up on you.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I was younger, I would provide myself with perspective exercises to sort out such things, although with high-dose I&#039;ve noticed that the crazy will stay around until the very end of the experience.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

Interesting hypothesis, indeed, and it seems that RR-2b and SS-2c totally support it. What is interesting is that sic-2a seems to outdo LSD on all but one dopamine receptors. I am a stranger to LSD isomers and have not even tried AL-LAD and LSZ yet, but this hypothesis of yours makes me want to compare.<br /><br />Coming back to overall set of affinities - am I right in assuming that the reason why DMT taken the day before LSD does not create tolerance for LSD is because DMT&#039;s &quot;main&quot; focus&quot; is 5ht7 while LSD&#039;s affinity to this receptor is approaching zero? It would also appear that while DMT barely touches on dopamine receptors, LSD is certainly active on most of them - could this aspect be responsible for practically no tolerance between the two? I guess I am keen to test the boundaries of usability of this data.<br /><br />Keep your thoughts coming, please!

				It takes indeed about 3X the original dose if you want to get back on the LSD-ship after you totally tripped out (= after sleep, a good meal and the necessary time to recover from your first experience), <br />but if you don&#039;t sleep nor eat but take amphetamine, you will not need that much. <br /><br />What will follow is a 100% hardcore mental regime, with mind-fuck and/or strong paranoia 100% guaranteed (I&#039;m speaking out of personal experience): you could start the first day with some LSD and take some HQ amphetamine on regular intervals during this first trip (I&#039;d say about 1 decent line every 2 hours) or take some methamphetamine but that will be quite more dangerous (especially for the come-down on the end of the 3 days), then without having slept or eaten (but drink enough water...or alcohol?) you could take some mushrooms bit by bit on the come down of the LSD (spread over 6h or so you&#039;d eat 2 or 3 full portions of them). By the time the mushrooms start to come down you should be in the &quot;experiment&quot; for over 36h (keep on taking amphetamine on regular intervals to keep you awake and not hungry). On the come-down of the mushrooms you could move on to some good MDA (or if not available MDMA) and possibly top that up with some 2C-B after an hour or 2. By the time this start to come-down you should have spent more than 48h tripping without sleep or food. At this point, the deprivation of your body and the mental load on your psyche should already be that hard that keeping taking amphetamine should keep you in a state of tripping - but if you really wanna go hardcore, take 3 more blotters of the original LSD&nbsp; and see where that brings you. <br /><br />Again, this is a HaRdCoRe combination. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone in any circumstance, but I now out of experience that it works (I didn&#039;t take the 2C-B though and mostly used MDMA when going that long/deep so that I&#039;d have kind of a period of &quot;rest&quot; in between). <br />The problems that you&#039;ll encounter the coming days, when trying to come down from hyperspace will be massive and will last about 10 days (unless you start taking &quot;something&quot; again... - beware of that danger if trying such a combo).

				For festivals I think ketamine is a great product (depending on how much you take you can alter the effects - see my specific post on &quot;how I use my ketamine&quot;). <br />LSD is great as well, but taking 3x the original dose brings you quite quickly in dosages of above 10 blotters and that is not only quite expensive, but the acidity of 2000 microgram LSD is much more than of 200 microgram and that might be someting to keep in mind (-&gt; GSE?). <br />Mushrooms are on option, just like mescaline - but I think those products are better used in nature/quite settings and not on a festival. <br />2C-B is certainly intersting, also GHB<br />Smoking some DMT is probably too intense on a festival and better enjoyed in quieter settings...<br /><br />So why not: <br />day 1: LSD, then (with or without sleep) day 2: MDMA, 2C-B and if wanted end with GHB, then (with or without sleep) day 3: ketamine<br /><br />You could add some (meth)amphetamine to the diet (to keep you awake/from eating - it also seems to boost some psychedelics such as LSD)... and off course, have plenty of weed/hash by hands at all times :-)

				My drugs of choice at festivals are LSD, MDMA/MDA, 2c-B, Hash an weed. <br /><br />The first day of music (or whichever night has my favorite band) I&#039;ll drop the LSD, maybe with a little MDMA to keep me social. <br /><br />Second night I usually eat some 2c-B for shits and giggles<br /><br />Third night I usually eat some MDA and MDMA if i have both, I&#039;ve been known to spontaneously eat more LSD the third night..<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t usually get real fucked up during the day. During the day I might just have a few beers or swigs of whiskey, and smoke oil and weed with my neighbors. To me, daytime at festivals is for recuperating. Eat some food, smoke a lot of herb, meet everyone around you and get comfortable so when night rolls around, SHIT GETS WEIRD!<br /><br /><br />When I went to Waka a&nbsp; buddy I went with made a bunch of DMT before and brought it all, he&#039;s got a thing for K too, so all weekend he&#039;s blasting people off. <br /><br />One morning we woke up to mimosas and K bumps.

So when I eat psychedelics I don&#039;t eat loads, tops 2-3 hits ( 200-300ug)<br />Lately I&#039;ve been loving ~150ug of LSD and then about an hour later (when I&#039;m just starting to feel the first waves) eat 125mg of MDMA<br /><br />They blend perfectly IMO. <br />When I&#039;m at a festival I try to take the next day easy. IF i eat drugs I&#039;ll go for just a little 2c-b or a little bit of mushrooms. For 2c-b I don&#039;t like anything under 20mg really. Everytime I&#039;ve eaten 10-15mg it feels wavy and not very profound at all. Then my buddy gave me a 25mg cap once, it was like eating a few grams of shrooms and 90mg of MDA. <br /><br />Sorry getting off track. I try to take a day of rest especially if I eat MDMA with LSD because MDMA floods your serotonin so i try to take at least one day to get my brain back on track. I&#039;ll take some supplements, eat some good food, fruit and protein. <br /><br />For Ketamine, I don&#039;t do it enough to give out dosages. I hear railing 100mg lines are good for a solid K hole, but I&#039;ve only K holed once, I normally do K when given to me by friends at shows, and I just do little key bumps. It feels like I&#039;m drunk but more groovy, if that makes sense. Doesnt last long that way either. <br /><br />Whatever festivals or events any of you are going to, Have fun and be safe! Remember, Hydrate or Die!&nbsp; :P

				I have a rather interesting question.<br />If cellulose is unable to be properly broken down by the human body, then why do we use a cellulose based &quot;paper&quot; for administration of LSD?<br />It seems that this practice would result in getting less LSD from the paper than was originally applied to it.<br />Can someone explain this to me?

				&nbsp; &nbsp;We have quite the interesting discussion going on here.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to give my take on a couple of<br />the issues presented.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ketamine - A pre-dose dose of about 50mg, or another at onset, greatly decreases body load and improves mood, increases spacial distortion-type visuals on most psychedelics and other drugs. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blotter - If done properly, does not make a huge drop in potency, although we can do better.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d like to see the plain-paper hits that we got in &#039;96, just plain art paper, don&#039;t know if it was&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bleached or what.&nbsp; &nbsp;dioxin could damge LSD AFAIK.&nbsp; Pure cotton paper is supposed to be the best, because&nbsp; its washed so there is no dioxin, acid or bleach in the paper.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stealth could be better with other methods than blotter, such as&nbsp; film or slides that are really doses!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What about if you were to get an envelope, and gelatin tabs were disguised as part of the packaging,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like under a laminated logo, on the letterhead? that would be stealthy as hell! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; candy is a hit-or-miss administration method, I&#039;ve heard L should be stored in neutral conditions,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with buffers, this is partially why excess tartaric acid isn&#039;t added during salting, they keep it at 2-3% <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;some candies in a 1 drop solution have a pH in the 2-3 range, not sure how well that goes over.&nbsp; I&#039;d take a&nbsp; &nbsp;gummy bear over a pez any day, although my friend swears pez are the shit.

				@Mr. Charlie, thank you - I am hearing time and time again how people lovingly blend MDMA and LSD ... Also, there would appear to be a word that MDA is even better in this combo. Have you tried it? Another +1 for your wisdom shared! <br /><br />And yes, ladies and gentlemen, &quot;hydrate or die&quot; is a very sound advice. Every time I seem to hear yet another terrible media story about MDMA death it all seems to boil down to overheating and dehydration.<br /><br />@anothergirl, interesting observation, but I am very skeptical that it could play a positive role. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it most likely to be damaging the molecule as even a tiny quantity of chlorine present in normal water are destroying it (this is why you dilute with solvents or totally distilled water) and here we have fluoride, which I suspect would do the same (I am no chemist). Please chip in if I am talking rubbish.<br /><br />If you got better effect then could it be that it was a different source and they have different dosing? Or your previous source was giving you rubbish product?<br /><br />@GGGreenbud, thank you and +1. I am interested in your Ketamine recommendation - small doses to start with other psychedelics is not anything I have ever heard before. Why do you think this is working like that? I like your far fetched stealth ideas, by the way. The only issue that these might require serious industrial-level tech ... or do you think this could easily be done?<br /><br />Be safe,<br />IM<br /><br />

I know the product back then was<br />extremely variable, perhaps the worst as far as consistency went.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I was heavily involved withthe street scene back then, so I had the luxury of having my doses pre-sorted, in that my street hustler friends wouldn&#039;t fuck me, and would actually tell me how clean the product was.<br />her uni. associates were from the same tribe as mine, so this will be very interesting. <br />&nbsp; I quit for a good long time, after i was consumed by hellfire for mixing it with DXM, creating<br />an insanely long peak, but it taught me a lesson, you CAN over-do it on two tabs sometimes.<br />&nbsp;Now that I am a Jedi/Shaman/Psychonaut for real, my faith and will are strong enough that<br />I am no longer afraid, there is a healthy amount of respect for LSD on my part, I mistreated <br />the compound, and that night with the DXM, she fought back.&nbsp; I have the scars to prove it,<br />but that will never happen again, ahead lies only slight vasoconstriction and a multitude of<br />visual distortions, followed by the crossing-over, the crux of the experience, when the third<br />eye opens fully, and the projections of the mind become reality, we transcend, and I am going<br />to attempt a true trance state, with the help of audio-visual stimulus as my mantra.<br />thump thump thump!<br />I&#039;d love to hear what everyone else is doing, as well! any craziness! (I hope so)

				@GGG, that ^ is a pure poetry that!!! +1<br /><br />May you find what you seek.<br /><br />No plans to trip this weekend ... unfortunately.<br /><br />Do you see AL-LAD and LSZ as a completely different set of substances that you intend to take along-side LSD in your life or are they just slight variations? I am very curious to try AL-LAD, since it allegedly has a shorter trip, but is it very different?<br /><br />Be safe,<br />IM

Ab-so-lutely :-D<br /><br />Of coarse your prices per tab, esp on 1/4 and 1/2 sheets (if youll be able to do that), will ultimately dictate just how much interest there is. Either way you can rest assure, people will buy them. You can take that shit to the bank. LOL<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that when shoppers see an LSD listing advertised at upwards of 400ug per tab, naturally they will be a bit skeptic as to just how accurate the dose is. A few sample tabs to reliable reviewers of your choosing, if you have the means and decide to do so, will quell any doubts that the skeptics may have and will render them highly unlikely to hesitate on placing the orders. <br /><br />OR just lay a handful of tabs and do a quick trial listing at a discounted price, to accurately gauge the interest for them. Much love man.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT; I just seen your page, you dont ship to US man?!??&nbsp; :o Shame :&#039;( That would increase your LSD clientele ten fold, at the least.

I am interested in your Ketamine recommendation - small doses to start with other psychedelics is not anything I have ever heard before. Why do you think this is working like that? I like your far fetched stealth ideas, by the way. The only issue that these might require serious industrial-level tech ... or do you think this could easily be done?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; The ketamine idea came about by accident, really.&nbsp; Three of us would have about $20 each, and would buy a 10-strip and have enough left for a couple $10 caps of ketamine, no more.&nbsp; So we would just snort it, pop the tabs and hold on!&nbsp; I think the idea is that the glutamate release lowers BP and cortisol, without affecting catecholamine levels, along the lines of the anti-depressant dose of ketamine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the ninja-stealth, gelatin is the obvious false-material, imagine a gel-cap filled with some kind of legal compound, and the gel cap IS the carrier!&nbsp; although we could take this deeper, and use some kind of celluloid photograph or postcard, or drop it onto those clear &quot;sheets&quot; that look like the breath strips, but have caffeine in them, which could be hidden under or in between layers of the envelope.&nbsp; I have a friend who has the most ingenious methods, one time he took a pack of cigarettes, and hid a strip in between the cardboard right next to the glue, so you had to tear apart the entire pack to even find the blotter!&nbsp; I don&#039;t think we would have to engineer some kind of polymer or anything like that. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One idea I was thinking of is with the microdots, if we could somehow get really high-tech and scaled down to the point of actually making them out of weighed grains of pure xtal, then coat them in sugar, they could be impregnated into raised lettering, or along perforations in form-letters.&nbsp; That way, the acid is IN the paper, but the paper isn&#039;t the carrier.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it will ever come to this, as current methods seem adequate, and seeing the TINY size of the current microdots, I&#039;m not really that concerned. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one thing I am slightly concerned about is a spectrometer being used to identify LSD&#039;s tell-tale fluorescence by bombarding it with long-wave UV, and measuring the precise nM-wavelength of the backscatter, they can already do that with x-rays.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t put it beyond some countries to do something like that, or attempts to weaken it with a short-UV, x-rays or with chlorine gas, which is my major concern with blotter at the moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;They might not be able to completely destroy it, but they could weaken the doses considerably at low cost, using fumigation with halogen gasses or ozone.&nbsp; I almost wonder if some of the &quot;lost potency&quot; reported by some vendors could be a result of tampering by officials.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They really have a hard-on for LSD after all of these years, they are afraid because it carries with it a philosophy which is non-aggressive, and unites the human race in a wonderful experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;No other precursors or watched chemicals will bring the DEA to your door faster than those for LSD, not crack, not heroin, and surely not meth.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You really have to question why they don&#039;t want people using it, given that they&#039;ve known since the 1950s that it does not spontaneously cause mental illness.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it is because other than freaking out, you can&#039;t really pin LSD as a dangerous drug.&nbsp; It is to be respected, and it will bring the strongest man to his knees, but not more than that.&nbsp; There is a deeply ingrained idea in the minds of politicians and other cults of personality that the Ego, and standing behind even the worst mistakes without any sign of weakness or sincere apology, is a virtue, and that loss of control is to be avoided at all costs(unless you have alcohol to blame it on!)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here&#039;s to the future! may it be painted day-glo with d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide!

				@GGG, ever tried public speaking?<br /><br />The only thing I miss from this picture is a barricade and a flag.<br /><br />+1 - worthy of DPR&#039;s manifestos.<br /><br />Be safe,<br />IM<br /><br />UPDATE: Now I wonder what flag would it be :)<br /><br />On a serious note, I think that if it was not for T. Leary&#039;s attempt to turn LSD into a political platform with such a massive appeal to youth we could be living in a lot more tolerant place. Aggression breeds aggression and despite all of his nods to buddhism his approach to compassion did scare some powers that be shitless and their knee jerked so bad that we still feel it 50 years later.<br /><br />Lets not repeat that mistake, I say. We find ourselves in the world where some medical research on psychedelics is possible again. The idea that LSD can significantly improve quality of life of terminally ill patients via inducing deep personal religious experiences is no longer laughed at, Strassman was able to get taxpayers money to do his DMT work. We need more patience and men of knowledge to bring this to the surface, not some religious mass movement to freak them out again.<br /><br />Rome wasn&#039;t built in a day.

				I finally caught up with the rest of this thread.&nbsp; Most of the copypastas (like the ChinaCat stories and the classic earlier texts on LSD indcluding the one on the first illicit synthesis that resulted in black goop) I had already read some time ago but it was nice to look through them again.&nbsp; There was still lots of new information and great discussion scattered throughout the thread.<br /><br />Just a page or two ago I was a bit excited by LightOfPi&#039;s suggestion of higher-dosed tabs, but that was shortlived when it was determined he doesn&#039;t ship to the US :(<br /><br />I did notice when I followed the links on tolerance several pages back, that there seemed to be some disagreement about 1 week mark.&nbsp; Most people seemed to agree that tolerance was mostly gone after 2 weeks (fairly close to 0%) but some people seemed to put tolerance at 120% after 1 week, while others put tolerance at 200% after 1 week.&nbsp; Personally, I think it is closer to 120% than 200%, but it might still be a bit higher than 120%.<br /><br />The receptor affinity charts looked pretty useful so I saved those for later reference.<br /><br />I think I will work on writing up a report for you all on my only (so far) really high dose LSD experience from a few years back (it was probably between 2-3mg, but it is hard to say because I could not verify the strength of the tabs and microdots used).&nbsp; I touched on this experience briefly in another thread in answer to someone else&#039;s question about high doses, but I think it deserves its full story told.

				This is my current situation and I thought you guys could help. I am posting this here and to the Avengers thread if that&#039;s okay.<br /><br />I personally have studied the therapeutic/self-growth uses of psychedelics/LSD for about 2 years now, and It is really my passion to be able to give people these transformative type experiences. Conducting one-on-one psychedelic therapy is what I study mostly and would be a dream for the future, but for now this is the next best option. <br /><br />Basically, I would like to start selling L at shows and festivals. not blotter , but using my vial to dose each person. Partly this will be to help me save up money to help pay living costs and save money to open an isolation tank center in the future. I would like to sell only maybe a vial or two a month MAX at shows . Going over that seems like is where trouble starts happening.<br /><br />&nbsp;I was thinking if I bought 2 vials for $7-800, that&#039;s somewhere around $1200 profit. That + working a 30 hour a week job would be ideal and could let me start saving up. Keep in mind I am moved out living on my own. College is not in my interest right now at least, due to the fact that my real passion is psychedelic therapy /flotation tanks and a degree isn&#039;t needed. <br /><br />Not the typical kid who likes to trip or just make money, I really do have similar beliefs for distributing the molecule as the &quot;Family&quot; had and similar intentions for doing this work besides just the money.<br /><br />It brings me joy to give someone the opportunity of having this experience, and plus It can help pay a bit for rent. Do you think this is a do-able/realistic plan? I do not want to go over a vial or two a month trying to keep it small here. Wouldn&#039;t it be pretty safe to sell only at shows with just one vial in possession in concert environments? Anyone I even dare to talk to about this clearly thinks I am an idiot for even considering this , and I would appreciate if you could give me any tips or things to keep in mind. Thanks.

Hope all is well with you :)<br /><br />Sadly guys, ive nothing to report about those dots. Me and my buddy did not really get anything out of them, some slight giggles, but tbh..they where weak. Maybe 100ug, which would seem isnt enough to get me to any place worth mentioning. <br /><br />The girls had a great time though, as they are new to L. I can further elab on this after work tn. Much love guys.

				Ok guys, well heres the run down on Chers microdots..<br /><br />It was me and my trip partner, and our women. It was his gf&#039;s first time and my ladies 2nd. We dropped the dots at 10pm. With in 20min i began to feel the first waves of the come up tingle down my spine. By 11pm the come up was in full effect. I am able to judge the L according to the come ups characteristics, but i hold all judgement untill +2hrs. <br /><br />So, by the come up, i determined that it was very clean LSD. There was zero body load what so ever. At the 2hr mark, i was able to definitively say that the dots are not nearly 130ug. Theres no chance of that. At all. I hardly ever drop less than 2-400ug, but when i do dose @ around 100ug..it always has me at a level that i am satisfied with. These dots by my estimation, my 10 pack any how, where no more than 80ug. <br /><br />It was good, it was clean and it was a decent night, but i had zero OEV, not even breathing. After 4 hrs i was able to get really stoned and find some CEV when focusing hard enough behind my eyelids. Aside from some slight giggles and a constant grin, that was about the extent of my experience with them. <br /><br />My girl had a blast, she couldnt stop laughing, at nothing for hours on end. She said she too had CEV, only she had no trouble seeing them when ever she closed her eyes. Her friend is not only a total idiot by my standards, but just isnt the type to appreciate or understand LSD in any way, shape or form. None of that by her own admittance, of coarse. heh. In spite of all that, she claimed to have felt it and said she had a good experience. <br /><br />My buddies take on the L, is not worth mentioning as his summery of the product was in fact less fruitful than my own. I have 6 dots left, which i plan on disposing of via ingestion with in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; Ill likely give the wife 2 and ill indulge in the remaining 4. There shouldnt be any reason why a dose of 4 of them will not land me in a magical place. Cause like i said, the L is very clean. Some of the cleanest that ive had in a long while. <br /><br />Well thats the post game report. Thanks for tuning in Lucy Lovers. 8)

I myself have not yet tried pimpit, but the avengers thread seemed to produce some good reports of his service and product quality. <br /><br />When your order comes through please stop in and leave a brief overview of his L, along with your over all experience with him. Much love brother.

As EA suggested, be sure to pre load on lots of vitamins, as well as the morning after. It is essential to keeping your brain chemistry as balanced and abundant as possible when dosing MDMA in succession as you plan to do. Happy candy-flippn&#039; 8)

				Well a few weeks ago I had my first 800-1000ug trip, and HOLY FUCKIN SHIT. Wildest shit I&#039;ve ever seen on acid. I am still working on the trip report, but man, the visuals were exactly what I was looking for. I think that will be my last high dose for a while. I was up at a friends fishing camp and I wasn&#039;t in public. But simple tasks were extremely hard. I tripped with three other people and I couldn&#039;t even converse. After three words were said I would be too confused. Walking was pretty hard during the peak, it was an event to walk somewhere else. My closed eyed visuals were extremely intense and multiple times I felt myself drift away with my eyes closed listening to pink floyd. Time was going slower than it had ever felt before. I shit you not to me ,during the peak, 10 minutes felt like an hour. <br /><br />In the end it was an awesome experience, but definitely needs to be done away from strangers and public, unless you can really handle your shit. I would like to dose high again in the future, but for now I will just stick to 2-4 tabs and some DMT to spice up the visuals. <br /><br />PsychedelicSphere
