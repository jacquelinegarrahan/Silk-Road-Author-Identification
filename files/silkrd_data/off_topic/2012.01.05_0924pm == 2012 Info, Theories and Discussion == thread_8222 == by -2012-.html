				Hi, I&#039;m just interested in the 2012 disaster theories. What does everyone think will happen (if anything)<br /><br />Is the Mayan calendar a sign?<br />Planet X?<br />Milky Way Aligning with the Earth &amp; Sun?<br /><br />Discuss :)

				I think astronomers would&#039;ve discovered any threats to Earth by now. Although I will be on edge in December. I think that&#039;s when it&#039;s supposed to happen.

				It&#039;s all shit, but so many ppl are into it now that there will be some small scale riots, esp. on New Years (most people don&#039;t know its the winter solstice) and hopefully some haley&#039;s comet like people (cult of people who all committed suicide cuz they thought alien ships were on Haley&#039;s comet).<br /><br />If a planet were hurdling towards the sun (with us in its path) we&#039;d have seen it in the night sky years ago, and by now it would be practically impossible to avoid.<br /><br />LHC hasn&#039;t destroyed us, it seems to have become far less remarkable to people once then lost concern that it was going to destroy them which sorta disgusts me cuz those people should now find it just as remarkable for how insanely complex and large this machine is ... this is by far the most technologically challenging device human&#039;s have ever made and barely anyone gives a fuck about that, makes me want to smack society.<br /><br />I was rolling with a lizard person at a rave a few weeks ago and all he wanted was for people to accept him, where rave/PLUR ideology was all that he could go to.&nbsp; We gotta stop with the lizard people hate guys, they&#039;re not among us to infiltrate us in 2012, they just wanna get fucked up like the rest of us.

				The probability of any peak event, mass extinction/destruction event, mass spiritual awakening, magical doo-ga-doo or divine intervention happening in 2012 is exactly the same as it was in 2011, 2010 and 2009. If you believe differently because of misinterpretations of Mayan calendars, &quot;prophecies&quot; or types like David Icke, then I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve eaten salads with a higher I.Q. than yours.
