Americans were throwing dinner parties with this stuff and eating raw onions, lemons, shit like that, it alters everything so that like lemons taste of strawberries and stuff. really charlie and the chocolate factory kinda stuff. I can´t remember what they´re called though. Google. magic berries that change the taste of food. <br />AC E

				psychs. had a skittle on truffles and the taste was so intense and overwhelming the rest of the pack sat untouched. i love the taste of sweet stuff when i&#039;m tripping, not so much the rest of the time. pretty much anything is good though. i wouldn&#039;t want to prep raw meat or fish and i wouldn&#039;t go near mussels or anything freaky like that. i had mussels stoned once and that was weird enough.

				as ron swanson, im a little sad that you dont eat meat while tripping, last time i did lsd, i had a medium rare steak and it was incredible. that being said, i have come to terms with my place in the food chain as a carnivore and eating/preparing meat doesnt really bother me

				oh i&#039;d eat it, i just wouldn&#039;t be cutting up beef and shit myself whilst tripping. i&#039;d look at it too closely and start mooing. i do that when i&#039;m sober and cook roast chicken make the raw thing dance around clucking. i&#039;m weird? &quot;give me all the bacon and eggs you have&quot; 8)

				Weed of course. Indicas tend to give me more of the munchies.<br /><br />Mushrooms. I don&#039;t get sick on shrooms and all the food taste divine.<br /><br />Xanax: These bad boys usually send me on an eating frenzy. Another good reason to not take them.

				I just remember two things from my first lsd trip all those years ago. <br />The pretzels I ate got stuck in my teeth and I spent what seemed like an hour and a half picking them out of my teeth.<br />I went to eat some roast beef and I truly felt bad for the cow.<br />Freaked me out good
