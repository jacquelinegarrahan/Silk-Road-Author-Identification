				I do them because they are enlightening, helpful, and some are just plain fun. With the proper research and self control drugs are relatively safe. I enjoy experiencing (nearly) EVERYTHING life has to offer, and that includes these certain molecules that over the years have been demonized and shunned. &quot;Drugs&quot; are neither bad nor good. They are tools.

				There&#039;s far too many reasons to list. Some people because they love them, some because they&#039;re addicted, some because they need to get away from problems and reality, some to enhance life, some for Spiritual purposes, some just to have fun, and some just for the fuck of it. I personally do Psychedelics for purely Spiritual purposes, and weed because I thoroughly enjoy it. I used to do it to get away from life&#039;s problems, but I&#039;m glad I&#039;m over that now.

				Sobriety is pretty boring. Drugs enhance reality. At least my favorite ones do, like LSD. Of course they also distort it to an extent. MDMA is a nice social drug. Smoking weed is kind of shallow as far as the high goes, but it is a nice way to not be bored. Amphetamine can come in handy for studying. The novelty of trying new research chemicals is pretty cool. I like having religious experiences and can&#039;t really have them without psychedelics. I like to hack my brain. Even drugs like coke and heroin are fun to experiment with. I actually think heroin would be excellent to try if I get depressed, although that could be dangerous. When I tried heroin I felt orgasmic though and any cares or concerns I had were gone. I can see how that could be addictive though. <br /><br />Largely I would compare some drug use to playing video games though. It is entertaining, it is fun, it kills time, it feels good. Others are like I imagine church must be for some people, or going to therapy or a museum or a reading a good book. Spiritually cleansing, emotionally healing, aesthetically pleasing and intellectually stimulating. It really just depends on the specific drug. If I summed it up in two words for all drugs in general, it would have to be &quot;reality enhancing&quot; though, although the interpretation of that changes with the substance ;).

				well i&#039;ve been dieing to try psychedelics in order to experience everything this world has to offer, it&#039;s just another activity no different then sky diving or climbing a mountain. It&#039;s another world that i feel must be visited. I am so fucking excited I ordered my shrooms and acid, they should be here in 1-3 days :D

				A long time ago, humans lived in the tropical forests of africa, eating fruits, tubers, and psychedelic plants. As all religious traditions concur, at some point we &#039;fell&#039; from this god-like state, and thousands of years of (relative) malnutrition has epigenetically impaired our consciousness. By taking psychedelic drugs we attempt to regain, if only for a moment, the &#039;pre-fall&#039; state. <br /><br />http://leftinthedark.org.uk/book

				Weed: because it calms me, takes away my depressive thoughts, improves my confidence and self-efficacy, and makes me an all-around funnier, more pleasant person.&nbsp; It also allows me to forget about trivialities from my past over which I used to obsess before I started smoking weed.&nbsp; It also relaxes me for sexy time!<br /><br />MDMA: because it makes me as happy as I was when I was a child, and I feel magical, and it changed my life, and I can bond with people like never before, and it&#039;s just nice to not have all those restrictive social barriers.&nbsp; <br /><br />MXE: because it takes me to another world for a bit, and it makes me very introspective, and it just feels damn good.<br /><br />Ketamine: because it&#039;s awesome and my friend is a K-head and gives it to me for free.<br /><br />Alcohol: because I like the taste of some of it, and getting drunk every once in awhile can be fun.<br /><br />Nicotine: because I&#039;m brainwashed and addicted.<br /><br />Stimulants: because sometimes you just need that little push.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Benzos: because Angry Birds is much more entertaining while high on Xanax.<br />

				Marijuana helps with my anxiety.&nbsp; And I like feeling high.&nbsp; It also makes music sound better.&nbsp; Psychedelics help me just feel like everything is ok.&nbsp; Ever since i started taking lsd on a regular basis, I started to study, and eat very healthy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Psychedelics allow me to have awarness in my life.&nbsp; Allows me to put things in my life into prespective and prioity.&nbsp; Maybe it be because they are good for depression, not that i am depressed much,&nbsp; but I do see it helping either way.<br /><br />They have also helped me reprogram my mind to defeat limiting beleifs, such as marjuana makes you lazy and kills your motivation.&nbsp; I look twords Terrence Mckenna for inspiration and proof that marijuana does not effect motivation. I make sure I hit the bong before studying.<br /><br />And damn do I love the orgasmic feeling and visuals they give me.<br /><br />I dont think opiates, meth, or coke or good for you in anyway, but moderation in everything is ok.

				Drugs are fun! I like to see the relationships between the chemical structures and the subjective experiences. They&#039;re my main source of entertainment. Things like Xanax, weed, and speed can help with everyday life, as well. Alcohol, empathogens, and some uppers make me social and talkative which is almost never a bad thing! I&#039;m hoping to go into a career focused around psychoactive drugs.

				Weed: because it shuts all the noise in my brain off; and sex is way better on it; and it goes great with opiates and buzz.<br />Opiates: because I like when my whole body feels like I&#039;m having a 6 hour long orgasm, duh!<br /><br />Weed+Opiates: because I like to not be able to fucking walk :D<br />Weed+Vodka+Opiates: look Weed+Opiates and because I like not being able to cum after pumping mad hot wife for hours&nbsp; :P<br /><br />ETA: One more thing about Opiates: I&#039;ve never worked harder than under influence of OXY or HYDRO, BECAUSE my body is in an orgasmic state, and mind is so euphoric, I can code C++ like Bjarne Stroustrup himself for hours without stopping for a second! When I do Opiates at home, I find the energy and motivation to do the most boring and time consuming tasks, and feel like a million bucks doing it!<br /><br />
