				Hey y&#039;all. I&#039;ll start of by introducing myself a little. Been on the forums a couple months now and have had some good success with ordering, but i&#039;ve also been scammed a few times. Oh well, you live and you learn.<br />I love SR for the superior quality product and the handfull of honest and legitimate vendors.<br /><br />Just wanted to say how much I appreciate all vendors for what they do. Theres much more risk involved for them than for buyers. Like cashing out all that btc must be a pain in the ass! And i&#039;m sure it&#039;s fairly expensive to vend here with the SR fees and shipping costs.<br /><br />You guys are risking your freedom to bring your customers quality product when you could make a higher profit by vending through another (safer) method. This is awesome and I cannot explain in words how much I appreciate you guys!<br /><br />Anyway. Vendors (not LEO or scammers) I fucking love you! Like I would give you a fucking hug if I knew you (unless that&#039;s creepy haha).

				Man I sure love drugs. Don&#039;t you just love drugs?<br /><br />Haha true though. I wonder how the SR guys cash out their bitcoins. Cause really when you think about it, unless there are people trading SERIOUS amounts of bitcoin, the SR team will be among the (relatively) few people selling absurd amounts.<br /><br />All LE needs is a list of the biggest bitcoin sellers, then a background check to see if there&#039;s a history of IT work or previous drug charges. And right there they&#039;ve got their suspect pool. <br /><br />DPR must have some kind of way of getting the BTC through. But ultimately at some point you do need to identify yourself to sell bitcoins. (unless you&#039;re selling outside of an exchange - but I can&#039;t see how they&#039;d shift such a large amount of weight doing that)

Benzos, prescription opiates, psychedelics, MDMA, weed, adderall, cocaine...<br />And then there&#039;s everything I haven&#039;t tried yet! Oh drugs, I still love them though :)
