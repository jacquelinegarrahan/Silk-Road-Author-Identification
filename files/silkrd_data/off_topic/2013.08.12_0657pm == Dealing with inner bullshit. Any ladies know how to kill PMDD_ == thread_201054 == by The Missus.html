				&quot;Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Like PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder follows a predictable, cyclic pattern. Symptoms begin in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) and end shortly after menstruation begins.[6]<br />Emotional symptoms are generally present, and in PMDD, mood symptoms are dominant.[6] Substantial disruption to personal relationships is typical for women with PMDD.[6] Anxiety, anger, and depression may also occur. The main symptoms, which can be disabling, include[7]<br />feelings of deep sadness or despair<br />feelings of intense tension or anxiety<br />increased intense sensitivity to rejection or criticism<br />panic attacks<br />rapid and severe mood swings, bouts of uncontrollable crying<br />lasting irritability or anger, increased interpersonal conflicts; typically sufferers are unaware of the impact they have on those close to them<br />apathy or disinterest in daily activities and relationships<br />difficulty concentrating<br />chronic fatigue<br />food cravings or binge eating<br />insomnia or hypersomnia; sleeping more than usual, or (in a smaller group of sufferers) being unable to sleep<br />feeling overwhelmed or feelings of being out of control<br />increase or decrease in sex drive<br />increased need for emotional closeness<br />Common physical symptoms include:<br />breast tenderness or swelling, heart palpitations, headaches, joint or muscle pain, swollen face and nose<br />an altered view of one&#039;s body - a sensation of &#039;bloating&#039;, feeling fat or actual weight gain.<br />severe headache&quot;<br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t stand it. It&#039;s every goddamn month. It feels like I wanna pop my spinal cord out of my neck for no goddamn reason. I&#039;m horribly moody. I don&#039;t know how to alleviate this depression/anxiety/anger. I&#039;ve tried talking to my doctor, but all they want to do is give me my adderall. I don&#039;t want to be in this state of mind....are there any ladies of SR that know how to deal with this? I&#039;m tired of dealing with it, I need a solution other than popping benadryl and sleeping through it.

				SR probably isn&#039;t the best place to seek medical advice but who knows, we may be surprised with some sound advice.<br /><br />All I can say as a guy is I feel for you and I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t have to deal with all that. Being a female is hard.

				Oh my, that is bad. I am nowhere near that extreme, do you have a regular exercise regiment? It&#039;s been a few years since I started working out 6 days a week and since then my &quot;bad&quot; symptoms have been very very minimal. Maybe that could help?<br /><br />-xoxo

				Has it gotten worse as you have gotten older? Just wondering, I know I have. <br /><br />My problem is the anxiety, and benzos would probably help but Drs dont have enough sympathy to even listen. Nor get it.<br /><br />Exercise does help, that is true..I dont have any great advice other then to say I feel your pain..or at least your anxiety, and probably 10 other peoples on some days..<br /><br />

				I should probably start exercising more, I used to practice ballet and my symptoms never got this bad when I did...<br /><br />Hell yeah it&#039;s gotten worse over the years. All my doctors tell me is to take ibuprofen. Every time I hear that I want to shove my fists down their throats...<br />It&#039;s just the feeling of not being able to shake off the depression and anxiety that makes me want to snap.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to throw some exercising into the mix. I&#039;ve been smoking weed a lot but that can only help so much.<br />Maybe meditation too, my bubba recommends it but I can&#039;t figure out how to rap my head around it. How do you sit still and think of nothing????<br /><br />Thanks for all the replies, I need to get my tush up and exercise.<br />

				Meditation is fantastic I really recommend the book Zendurance which would double benefit you in guiding you in meditating and for exercise. It&#039;s focus is on extending endurance through meditative techniques and I think it could useful in dealing with PMDD potentially.<br /><br />-xoxo

				&quot;lasting irritability or anger, increased interpersonal conflicts; typically sufferers are unaware of the impact they have on those close to them&quot;<br /><br />This rings true, my &#039;missus&#039; suffers from this terribly. I love her dearly but each&nbsp; month it seems to take me by surprise...She gets really nasty. The hardest part is afterwards, its like she doesn&#039;t realise. She will say things like &quot;you&#039;ve been really grumpy recently&quot; and I grit my teeth thinking &#039;you really don&#039;t remember what I was responding to?!&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel sorry for women in this regard. The only thing in my experience I can compare is drug withdrawal, (please don&#039;t be offended I know the two are very different.) When in WDs from H or benzos, as well as the physical side, you get this horrible feeling where everything just seems shit and pointless. You feel intense discomfort just being in your skin. You try and tell yourself its just a chemical imbalance in your body/brain but that&#039;s no comfort. At the time it feels real, and you start feeling like that&#039;s the reason you started taking drugs in the first place.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess the negative emotions that women experience are similarly hard to ignore. In fact reading that list of symptoms again, it does sound remarkably like heroin withdrawal. I wouldnt like to do that every month!

OMG I wish for such a thing!!! <br /><br />In the past 10 years it has gotten worse, and I know for me, I feel like a thread stretched as tight as can be, and its nothing to make me snap..but I grit my teeth and try not to take everyones heads off around me..especially since I notice it now, but that seemed to also bring on the end of the world depression that I normally dont have..I could cry at nothing. And I dont like that. gah. <br /><br />Hope you&#039;re feeling better with some exercise, and let me know if you figure out how to meditate..<br /><br />And yes it is unfortunately a lot like opiate withdrawal..I mean like wow like it is..only other horrible thing I have felt close to as bad as the hormonal crap has been paxil withdrawal..

				try some kratom. it&#039;s an opiate-containing plant in the coffee family that&#039;s much less addictive than your standard opiate. it has antidepressant and antianxiety effects. higher doses are excellent for pain relief. it also stimulates the immune system.

				small bumps of ketamine or methoxetamine as needed might be good. they are both excellent for alleviating pain, plus having antidepressant and antianxiety effects.
