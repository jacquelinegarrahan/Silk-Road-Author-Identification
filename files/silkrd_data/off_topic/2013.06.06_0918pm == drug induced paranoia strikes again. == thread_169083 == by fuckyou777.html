				so i set out to make a few bucks locally. sell a quarter gram mdpv to some one fore $25 bucks i bought it from qd somthing. well i made the $25. (17.10 after cost) but qd hooked it up he hooked it up fat a whole gram. well this led me to giving it out to friends and becoming quite reckoless 5 days later and not a minute of sleep i was in peak delerium mode. got paranoid some one had stole my phone. with orbot still running well this became an imediate password change....that i dont remember. thus my sr account is lost forever. my new s/n is fukyou777 so its not that confusing. and it is me.&nbsp; goood thing i didnt change my forum password luckily.&nbsp; &nbsp; i found my phone the next day at the foot of my bed. all previous vendors will be directed to this page for identity conformation. this sucks too as i had VERY good stats....damn maddie

				whoah i believe you have me confused with someone else. no i KNOW you have me confused with someone else. for one i have never done buissness with said vendor and 2 my biggest order i ever made was like $250 bucks. also if you truly have seen my s/n mentioned in a thread could you point me in that direction because i would like to clear the air. but im sure you didnt
