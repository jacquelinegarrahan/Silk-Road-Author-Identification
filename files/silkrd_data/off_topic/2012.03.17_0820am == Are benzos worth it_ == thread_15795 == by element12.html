				I&#039;ve been researching benzo&#039;s a lot lately and I have a hard time understanding the demand.<br /><br />I find so many train wreck stories for Xanax about combos with alcohol (I even know someone who died from combining with alcohol) or overdoses and it seems like despite its chill reputation it&#039;s one of the more dangerous drugs out there.&nbsp; Especially since it affects your memory and is very prone to redose.<br /><br />What exactly does a benzo do?&nbsp; Besides make you sleepy and relaxed?&nbsp; Effects of psychedelics and dissociatives are fairly clearly defined, and opiates are understandable because they make you feel good and coke/meth because they make you feel powerful.<br /><br />The only one I&#039;ve used before is valium, where I&#039;ll take a couple while tripping or coming down if I have to go to sleep.&nbsp; But it seems like there is way more demand for xanax, people paying like $5 a bar.<br /><br />What&#039;s the appeal?

				I agree there is definitely a very legit use for benzos when needing to sleep, psychedelic comedown, anxiety... but there is also definitely a recreational component for many users as well. Some people just react differently or have varied preferences and will find benzos more enjoyable than other people, or will find specific benzodiazepines more enjoyable than other benzos. Many people probably really enjoy the way that your stress just floats away and you have no more worries or distractions from ones day after using them. There are more powerful benzos that cause noticeable intoxication as well, resembling that of alcohol which is also a GABARa allosteric modulator. I prefer the buzz over that of alcohol certainly and find myself much more sociable, so that is also another use in ways. Valium is one of the less intoxicating and euphoric of benzos... people just seem to find alprazolam and clonazepam (or nitrazepam if you can get your hands on it). once you become more experienced or take a sufficient dose, the effects are certainly noticeable beyond sleepy relaxation. <br /><br />Its interesting you mention the dangers of benzos which is certainly true. The sad thing is benzos are actually fairly safe by themselves even if people repeat dose as you mentioned. Their are two main problems outside the low intrinsic toxicity though which increases their danger. One involves the idea that benzos are safe relatively, especially compared to that of say barbs (also GABAR) or opiates, which I think kinda lures people into a false sense of security. Because they are safe individually and a commonly used medication, people dont really consider the dangers of mixing them sadly. Also, the inherent decrease of ones inhibitions, and especially memory as you mention also, results in people either deciding they should take more, or not having the rational thought processes to stop themselves from taking something else in addition, say alcohol or opiates which is extremely dangerous and combining factors in many deaths. <br /><br />After a summer of liquid caps my group of friends made from powder alprazolam, I kinda have tried not to abuse them too much anymore. Mainly after psychedelics or to make opiate withdrawal more bearable. One of my favorite combinations is definitely a benzo and some good coke though! The edginess is mellowed out but really potentiates the feel good vibes from both. Im not really a upper kinda guy unless got some work to do...<br /><br />Hope I helped answer your question in addition to my ramblins <br />- miR

				Oh yes Benzos are definitely worth it if you are a Stim lover like me.Taking 1 or 2 mg Etiz,Lorazepam,Diatepam or whatever at the end of a binge will not only make it possible for you to get to sleep easily, also you won&#039;t have any comedown as long as the benzo lasts which is 12-24 hours.<br /><br />So bascically you can binge a whole day on a stim,end of the night you take a benzo,go to sleep,the day after you get up in the afternoon(if it&#039;s a WE) and you will feel perfectly fine :D

				Wow, I learned a lot, and I thought I knew enough.<br />I start using benzo&#039;s when I join here.<br />Work was killing me, my boss is a total micro managing asshole.<br />I can&#039;t tell you the 10 of thousands of $$$ he has cost me. Fuck the company.<br />Anyhow I figured valium was the cheapest, seem to be least risk.<br /><br />I start to feel good, devoted myself from my job stress.<br />However there&#039;s a slight brain slowdown, and short term memory doesn&#039;t sort/store info well.<br />I handle highly technical problems. (yes. while high)<br />I &#039;m also loosing weight very slowly, which was a good thing.<br /><br />My question is this;<br />I think I tried all the benzos from pharmville<br />Xanxax does nothing for me.<br />Kinopins or whatever<br />Enzolam felt slightly nice.<br /><br />But I love Valium the best, why is that?<br />These other benzo&#039;s are suppose to be stronger.<br />The job stress is bugging me, I slip a pill under my tongue.<br />Within a minute, I&#039;m cooling down.<br />Ahhhhhhh..... mmmmmmmm. you know what I mean?

				NO!<br /><br />In the short-term, a couple 5 or 10mg Valiums are a good remedy for trips that have went awry, or the occasional sleepless night.<br /><br />I was addicted to Klonopin for only four months (upwards of 4mg a day), and had two t-clonic seizures whilst withdrawing. <br /><br />They are nothing to mess with..

				Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; I guess I get the point of using them occasionally for stress relief or sleeping.&nbsp; <br /><br />What&#039;s the deal with huge doses though?&nbsp; Like I hear of people doing 10mg Xanax for fun

				Well,there are lots of people who say a benzo addiction is pretty bad but in my case benzos only make feel tried I don&#039;t get any happy feelings from it. For me benzos are the least addictive drugs I have ever come across! <br /><br />But it is different for everybody<br /><br />Higher doses will get you in a drunken like state but still no real euphoria to speak of just that feeling that everything bounces off you all that while still being able to think somewhat clearly.<br />
