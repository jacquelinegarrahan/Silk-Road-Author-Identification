				the proper blue pills are far too strong if you don&#039;t normally have a problem, you will stay *painfully* hard for fucking hours. try some of that kamagra jelly - that shits pretty good if you&#039;ve got coke-dick and with a bit of will power you can get rid of your hard on

				You know what is great about Viagra? It can save you from vaso-constriction related heart failure. If you get a pain in the left side of your chest when doing stims, pop a Vi and then it&#039;s all good. Another good one for it is Nitroglycerin spray. :)

				I find 25mg makes it pretty easy to overcome the effects of MDMA, and (it&#039;s probably just placebo/psychological) but it adds a nice erotic feeling to the roll as well. It makes it nice and easy to get an erection when I want it, but I don&#039;t get a painful, long lasting one that won&#039;t go away.<br /><br />In the interest of science, I took 50mg without taking anything else, just to see what would happen (I have no problem getting an erection when not on drugs) and sat down to watch some House. It was kind of novel/interesting to get a boner while not feeling aroused at all (perhaps I just have a repressed desire for Mr. Laurie?). Anyway, I got a very firm erection without even touching myself that lasted about two hours. Wasn&#039;t especially painful, but it was kind of annoying not to be able to get it to go away.

I do the L-Arginine thing because it&#039;s good for you if you do a lot of heavy stims anyway like Bing and Meph. You also definitely notice a change in your sexual appetite when after using it for a bit too because it jacks up your sperm count.
