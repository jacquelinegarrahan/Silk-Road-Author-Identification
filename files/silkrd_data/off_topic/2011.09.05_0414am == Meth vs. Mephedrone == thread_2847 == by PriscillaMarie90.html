				I was just wondering what the real difference is, if there is much of one? I&#039;ve heard that Mephedrone is just like Meth, but not as potent. Alternatively, I&#039;ve heard Mephedrone feels like your brain cells are dying and you&#039;re getting stupider by the second, which is how I feel when I smoke marijuana (which i don&#039;t particularly like to do.). I have no idea WHY anyone would feel that way, but I have never tried Mephedrone, so I really would not know. I am very familiar with Meth, so if it&#039;s similar, I get it. Anyone who has tried both, I&#039;d like to know your opinions! I&#039;d also like to know what other drugs anyone has tried that have the same or similar effects as Meth. I really enjoy smoking it, but if something else can get the desired effect and Meth is not available, I&#039;d probably try some. Anyways, go go go!

				I dunno, I love meth, but have never tried mephedrone, and don&#039;t intend to. My impression is that they&#039;re not really similar, this comes from reading a good number of trip reports as I was once curious about mephedrone. It is a stimulant in some way, but I doubt it compares to meth.&nbsp; :)

				Meth to me is more of a drug to get things done, like adderall/dexedrine.&nbsp; You can get pretty high off it but in my opinion, mephedrone is like 10x more euphoric and better of a party drug.&nbsp; Nothing i&#039;ve ever taken comes close to mephedrone.&nbsp; But its probably way worse for your body/brain than meth.. nobody knows really but it looks to be a lot harsher on your heart etc.
