				Im sorry to bring you down man....but you have 2 posts.....and your user name is named after a horrible board....<br />Noone in there right mind, no matter how giving they are would give you free BTC.<br /><br />Now, im sure if you got in close with a vendor after months and months of purchasing, i think someone would be more inclined to help you out....<br /><br />But seriously? Begging and asking for free btc doesnt work here. Why not google &quot; How to make bitcoins &quot; And come back in a month.

Other than illegal, immoral stuff like buying hacked paypal/ebay accounts, credit cards etc. I don&#039;t see many other proper ways of making money on the deepweb. Maybe lotteries, but that is not a legitimate way of how money should be made.
