				What are some good carding sites that are still online? I am registered at carding planet/ darkspot so if anyone has feedback about the admin there that would be cool too.

				both scams, dont fall into that, 2btc for an iphone 5 64gb? rofl, the admin edits all the threads/posts and delete user accounts. ive almost fell with that bs, but, thats why we always chase escrow bro, ive offered him pay TWICE the price and the escrow fee, and still mad at me, rofl.<br />&nbsp;(He will talk bullshit of alboraq and else to defend himself and be agressive as hell, also, the guy dont use pgp or nothing, just YAHOO.)

				For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m also looking. <br />I found a guy called mattlicks .&nbsp; He&#039;s on BMR, and hackBB.&nbsp; He&#039;s apparently verified on hackBB whatever the hell that is worth.&nbsp; He has feedback and responded to my inquiries.&nbsp; <br /><br />His prices are $50. For 5 cards with CVVs.&nbsp; Which means the secret pin code is with them and expiry and all that.&nbsp; He also said he&#039;d help use hem for my first time and direct me to some Canadian sites that work well. <br /><br />Anyhow, I searched all over the dark web for the same quest as you.&nbsp; This guy was the only one who seemed to have a reputation. Although there are many others who sell huge lists of cards.&nbsp; <br /><br />I forgot to mention he does escrow on both sites.&nbsp; He lets you try one out quickly before releasing funds.&nbsp; The rest are a gamble though with assurance of what the balance might be.&nbsp; But thats normal and fair though.
