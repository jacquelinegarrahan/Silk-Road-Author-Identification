				I am trying to break this down. My rolls have been so inconsistent it&#039;s almost frustrating. So here&#039;s my&nbsp; question.<br /><br />Does purity have anything to do with cleanliness? <br /><br />I have had MDMA which is amazingly &quot;clean&quot; where the come up is ever so smooth, and not a lot of body load (minor nystagmus and bruxism). The come down in almost non-existant and I am able to fall asleep like a baby. The next day I have a nice afterglow and I don&#039;t feel fatigued in any way at all.<br /><br />Then I have had MDMA where the come-up is pretty intense and the roll is really messy. I am unable to think clearly and there is a major body load. Then there is no gradual fall back to baseline, it justs feels like I pooped all my serotonin out and that is all. Then I have a hard time falling asleep and feel like shit the next day.<br /><br />I always test my stuff so don&#039;t tell me that it&#039;s cut with something else. What is really going on here?

				Two possibilities that I can see.<br /><br />1.) Body chemistry. Our bodies are always changing based upon our moods, the time of year, whether we&#039;ve been sick, even whether we&#039;ve been having sex. Plus a million other things. Stress (or lack thereof) has a huge impact on our physical health, as well as exercise, diet, etc, etc. Maybe you didn&#039;t eat breakfast once, maybe you had a beer the next time, maybe you were dropping with your crush and you were relaxed and happy even before the drugs kicked in. I think people notice this a lot more with psychedelics, but even with stimulants, we can feel vastly different due to things that we can&#039;t see.<br /><br />2.) The synth. Synthesizing MDMA is a complicated process requiring precision, a decent understanding of chemistry, a healthy disregard of the law, proper access to precursors. If the chemist isn&#039;t working with pure chemicals at the beginning, then the odds are he&#039;s not going to get pure chemicals at the end. &#039;Garbage in, garbage out.&#039;, as they say. You&#039;re product may be &#039;clean&#039; in that there aren&#039;t any adulterants or &#039;cuts&#039; added, but it could also be &#039;impure&#039;, meaning it contains stuff other than pure MDMA: unreacted precursors, contaminants, or leftover gunk from impure starting chemicals. Unless you were in the room when the synth was happening, there&#039;s no way to know what might have gone wrong. Impurities in the synth go through lots of chemical reaction with the future MDMA, which can alter their chemistry in interesting ways. Ostensibly, the synth process is simply:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Distillation: of Natural Oil to obtain pure Safrole<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rxn: Formaldehyde + Ammonium Chloride -&gt; MethylAmine.HCl (MeAm.HCl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rxn: Safrole -(Wacker Oxidation(PdCl2+Benzoquinone))-&gt; MDP2P<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Distillation: of Reaction contents to yield pure MDP2P<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rxn: MDP2P -(Al/Hg Amalgam (MeAm.HCl) -&gt; MDMA oil<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Crystallization: (MDMA oil + HCl in IPA/Xylene) (anhydrous conditions)<br /><br />But if anything from the Cook to the Chems to the cleanliness is amiss, there&#039;s a chance you&#039;re going to be getting something less than 100% pure MDMA HCl. No telling how you might be affected by the impurities.<br /><br />Finally, if you&#039;re taking pills as opposed to measured MDMA crystal, it becomes much harder to know just how much you&#039;ve taken on any given day. Was it 200mg like the dealer said, and you&#039;&#039;ve just got crazy tolerance, or was the pill actually 100mg and taking another half would put you right where you want to be? If you had MDMA crystal and weighed the doses yourself, did you calibrate the scale properly? Did you accidentally include the capsule weight when weighing the MDMA? It&#039;s hard to know exactly why your roll comes out the way it does.<br /><br />You could set up a trial wherein you take identical doses of MDMA spaced equidistant from your previous roll, while simultaneously keeping a food/exercise diary paired with a daily mood chart to see if you can establish some correlation between lifestyle and Quality of Roll, and then systematically eliminate variables until you can isolate the critical factor.<br /><br />Or you could do your best to eat right, get regular excercise and plenty of sleep, surround yourself with people that you love, try and learn new things,&nbsp; try out one of the pre/post-loading regimens or suppliment suggestions that are floating around the forums, read up on vendors and order the pills/powder that best suits you, and enjoy the fact that the universe has afforded you the luxury of recreational drug use. Your rolls will be occasionally amazing, frequently average, and sometimes terrible. We&#039;ll probably never know the exact reasons you rolled superhardhammervisionamazingamazingOMG!!! one month and only got an upset stomach and a headache the next. One thing we do know, however, is that our days here on Earth are numbered, and the best we can do is fumble forward, day-by-day, as best we knows how, trying our best to make a few friends, help where we&#039;re able, and find happiness wherever it lives.<br /><br />Praise the Lord and pass the Defqons. <br />In Shulgin&#039;s name, Amen.
