				Hey-o,<br /><br />So I was dicking around the web a couple days ago and came across the site drugbuyersforum. Can&#039;t remember what I was looking for but anyways I poked around and people on there are claiming to sell pills -- some of them at pretty reasonable prices. <br /><br />Anybody know something about these kinds of sites or at least this one in particular? It seems plausible -- emailing someone with a request, money through Moneypak, drugs in the mail: same set up as SR without the escrow and additional anonymity. <br /><br />Anyways, I figured I&#039;d pose the question about these kinds of sites and see if anyone ever messed with them and wanted to share their opinions/experiences.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				This site&#039;s just a major scam. Their vendors are all scammers. You can get better prices for pharms than on SR on legit online pharmacies though.<br /><br />Sources :<br />https://safeorscam.com/sites/f83adfbce30c073c2fa20cdd746883168d01b3d21aefc806ee6e09f3fd09d940a4e47a19<br />http://www.scam.com/showthread.php?t=134383<br />http://www.pharmacyreviewer.com/forum/scam-pharmacy-forums/15780-scam-alert-drugbuyersforum-org.html

				Too bad. I did get that vibe off the site so I didn&#039;t bother contacting anybody. It was one of those &quot;if it sounds too good it probably is&quot; moments but I&#039;m a dreamer so I figured I&#039;d ask if there are any sites like this that are legit or if maybe my vibe was off on this place. <br /><br />I&#039;m always poking around the net looking for some of these online pharmacies but a lot of them give off similar vibes and after check a couple I just get frustrated and quit. Maybe I should get in the habit of using this safeorscam site to help me feel out these sites. <br /><br />Anyways, thanks for checking into it, tree. +1 to ya. So many crooked places out there. Damn shame.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				A number of the online no prescription needed &quot;pharmacies&quot; are legit.. in a manner of speaking.. They just sell you the low quality, borderline fake, meds from India.

Some good SR vendors get their stuff from online pharmacies like that. Vendors that sell crappy bunk xanax get them from Pakistan for 10 cents a bar.<br /><br />To find a good pharmacy, remove the Indian and Pakistani ones, check it out on safeorscam and if you get a good vibe from it then you should be good. A lot of legit ones would be &quot;too good to be true&quot; based on SR prices but they&#039;re for real ;) You can&#039;t pay in bitcoins though and you basically FE every time so it&#039;s definitely not as safe as using SR.
