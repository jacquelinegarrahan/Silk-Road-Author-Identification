				So, the value of BTC fluctuate, much like the stock market.<br /><br />So, how do vendors react? Say one day i have $70 worth of btc and then the next day, $100. At the same time, a vendor has a listing that sells for $70 worth of btc. Will their prices also rise to $100 worth of coin?

				Your information is outdated.&nbsp; They&#039;re at $19.50 USD.<br /><br />If it&#039;s a hedged listing, then the price is in USD and Silk Road adjusts the bitcoin cost as the average price rises or falls.&nbsp; If the listing isn&#039;t hedged (vendor can choose which he wants), the price is in bitcoins and it doesn&#039;t change just because they cost more or less in dollars.&nbsp; That&#039;s the basic idea, anyway.

So if a vendor wants $100 for a gram of coke, it will always be $100USD even if the bitcoins go up and down... Say a bitcoin is worth $10... than ten bitcoins would buy it.... But if a bitcoin equaled $5, you would buy 20 but it still costs $100...<br /><br />Hedged vs unHedged
