				What are your favorite drugs for creativity?<br />Primarily interested in creativity in writing prosaic fiction. Most effective would be drugs that allow for the creation of effective pieces of stories that are later able to be rendered into something more tangible and enjoyable by all (including those not under the influence).<br /><br />I have been considering giving opiates another go for these purposes, anyone have thoughts on that?<br />I have also considered stimulants, but I must not be using them properly since they regularly seem to constrain my creativity as of late.<br />I&#039;ve used psychedelics in the past, but the great levels of introspection are too powerful to sit down and really get much valuable writing done. <br /><br />Anyways, looking forward to the input of SR!&nbsp; :)

				Weed&#039;s pretty good for thinking outside the box. If you&#039;re looking for psychedelics without the introspection I&#039;d say give the 2C-X family a try, or even mushrooms (mushrooms have nil introspective effect for me, but this is not the case for everyone).<br /><br />Stimulants wise, it depends what you use. Some are more suited to mechanical thinking (not what you want) than others, see what works for you.

				I consider myself a creative sort. <br /><br />Opiates are a classic for prose. I think you can recall such names as Edgar Allen Poe and similar writers who smoked opium and wrote. That being said, Edgar Allen Poe had some serious issues. <br /><br />I really like psychedelics for creativity. However, this comes down to personality. I find that the introspection gives rise to a creative outlet, so it is when you become comfortable with this introspective state that you can begin to create within it. I would also advise sticking with more natural substances such as Mushrooms. My experience is that although RC&#039;s and synthetics are amazing and great fun, true experience and difference in experience comes from more natural drugs as there resides a connection to nature in the ritual of taking the drug. The experience didn&#039;t come from the laboratory, it came from mother earth. This in itself is enough mental stimulus to create something.&nbsp; <br /><br />I find weed to be a downer.You can do things on weed however you begin to notice a drool of thought rather than a creative flair. <br /><br />However, all this being said, I am wary to be truly creative on any drug. I find that if you find creativity on drugs you should seek it once off the drugs as well, so you know what you experienced is tangible and reachable without the drug. For if you begin to link creativity and drugs, you will just take them to be creative and with that comes a delusion. <br /><br />So, experiment, have fun, but remember to understand and reflect upon what you did whilst on the drug. <br /><br />Keen to see what others say about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve always found that a good quality sativa is really good for creativity. Not sure if I could keep my thoughts straight enough on psychedelics, especially writing. I wouldn&#039;t know much about opiates because they make me feel sick, I throw up after taking one 500mg hydrocodone.

Back several years ago, I was a regular user (about once per month, sometimes more) of psychedelics in the name of mind expansion and creativity. Recently I have been sober for about two years with some minor drug use. I have stayed away from psychedelics because I feel like every time I use them they tell me that I do not need them anymore, that I have learned all that I can from them. This message from you is, in a way, a reminder to find the creativity within my sober self rather than to spend resources seeking the creativity that exists in a chemical. <br /><br />That being said, what are your thoughts on stimulants, such as what kinds lend themselves to what kinds of creativity?<br /><br />And with regards to opiates, say for one or two sessions of creative writing, what would you suggest I try in the name of experimentation?<br /><br />Thanks for the responses so far!

				Interesting you say that. I think I have just hit that myself with psychedelics. <br />The last time I took them I came to the realization that the experience was not going to change much from here on in. So I think I am off them for a bit too. <br /><br />My suggestion would be to get yourself some hands on some smoke-able opium. And start to experiment from there. Start with a ritual so you have an access point. <br /><br />As for stimulants. I have not actually tried to be &#039;creative&#039; on them. I find them more &#039;functional&#039; than allowing for calmed creative thought. But, you have put the thought in my head, so I might give it a go sometime soon :)<br /><br />I would love to try something sensual like drawing or painting on MDMA. I think that would really thrive in such a situation.

I think we should keep one another updated on our creative endeavors, owing that we seem to be on the same wavelength. Never experienced smoke-able opium, so I&#039;ll definitely have to give that one a go.<br /><br />If you are a writer or painter, check out **CLEARNET WARNING**<br />thehollerbox.com<br />It&#039;s a new literary magazine which is accepting submissions to be published.

				DMT is pretty great for passionate bursts of creativity. <br />I don&#039;t think I have explored it enough to have a say though. <br /><br />I don&#039;t consider myself a writer of painter, just simply dabble in both. <br /><br />I have invested the last 3 years of my life in the performing arts.

				Returned the favor Denoyer, always a pleasure to meet a fellow artist.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />And on the topic of DMT use for creativity, is this a low dose we&#039;re talking about here? I highly doubt one could produce any conceivably crafted writing while blasted off in DMT hyperspace haha.

				for prose i would have to say opiates, arthur rimbaud wrote a season in hell i believe in the midst of an opium binge.&nbsp; but as you can tell with him as well as edgar allen poe opiates seem to bring out a much darker and depraved kind of writing style.......as for artistic creativity i know alex grey swears by strong psychedelics like DMT

				Well, for the sake of this discussion, let&#039;s say I wanted to go more for a writing style like Chuck Palahniuk (author of Fight Club, Choke, Diary, Survivor, etc) or Don DeLillo (author of White Noise, among others)? Not saying that a substance will make me a great writer by any means, I&#039;m just asking about what drugs might bring out certain types of creativity that are already inside me but are having trouble manifesting.

				Definitely 2c-d by far, generally low doses of any psychedelic will stimulate your creativity. If you&#039;re already naturally creative a stimulant would help a lot (dexedrine, adderall, etc)

				For me, believe it or not- OPIATES. STRONG opiates :D.<br /><br />I am a purebreed opiophile, though. But, strong opiates slow me down and speed me up at the same time. They slow down my patience with menial tasks and speed up my efficiency.<br /><br />Not only can I build/fix/repair/create a mean anything while warm and fuzzy, but I am a beast at work, as well, easily topping the production charts at my meaningless wage slave job.<br /><br />This is why I think painkillers are becoming such a huge problem, aside from the fact that&#039;s why we are still in Afghanistan and the government/pharma is making a huge profit off of it... Opiates are the perfect &quot;work&quot; drug. They motivate one enough to go full-fledged at his job, as trivial as it maybe, for long hours- and still feel good about himself. In this time of economic downturn, it&#039;s a very seductive thing because ppl need to work more hours than normal just to make the ends meet- and opiates aid greatly in that.<br /><br />The only problem is- most people, myself included, don&#039;t know when to flip the switch and let it become a problem, and end up spending all the extra money theyre making on opiates (plus more), anyway, so it&#039;s a wash in the best cases and puts you in the red in most.<br /><br />With that said... Hopefully my fentanyl arrives here shortly :).

				I have written several books and countless magazine articles. I have written long hours high on everything from LSD to No-Doze. I have found i get my best results when I write while mildly tripping on acid/shrooms (and by mildly tripping, I mean high enough to be weird, but not so high I get distracted because i become convinced the blinking cursor is sending me a message in morse code). It is not so important what you take while writing a first draft, what is important is what you take while re-writing what you wrote while you were baked. You need stims - be they coffee or adderal or a tiny bump of meth to help you focus. Think of&nbsp; psychedelics/weed/booze as the sledgehammer to bust open your mind and create something unique, think of the stims as the 600 grit sandpaper you need to polish it into something smooth.

				Got to jump on the low-dose psychedelics boat. Higher doses may stimulate more &quot;raw&quot; creativity, but can make it impossible to channel this into practical applications, usually not for lack of concentration, but for excess of concentration on minutiae, and for creating difficulties of articulation. Lower doses, on the order of perhaps a quarter to a third of what is usually considered a strong &quot;hit,&quot; depending on the substance and whether gradations in weight yield linearly proportional gradations in effects. Recent experience with nbomes has put me onto the one-third figure. Happy arting

				depending on what im doing, it differs from medium to medium.<br /><br />if im writing, i need to be sober to get anything worthwhile out of myself.<br />i get too side- tracked with being high, all the racing thoughts n all,&nbsp; that i cant concentrate on what i need to be putting down on paper.<br /><br />however im more of a visual artist anyways, not so much into writing, or at least not as much into writing as i am painting or sculpting.<br /><br />if im sculpting i like to smoke weed.<br />it mellows me out and makes it easier to just stop worrying about the accuracy&nbsp; of the sculpture, and start letting myself just kindof sink into the little creativity bubble that is honestly way too hard to find sometimes.<br /><br />painting is a different matter too though. i find i make more in-depth work when im on LSD or DMT <br /><br />and&nbsp; more on the dark and creepy side if im on mushrooms.<br /><br /><br />when i smoke weed,&nbsp; i get lazy though, so if i ever do decide to work on something after smoking, i just never finish it and it sits in my pile of unfinished stuff for the rest of eternity. same goes for when i take too much of something, if i get too out of my mind, i just end up outside. no time for painting i need to look at the clouds. :O

I read the erowid reports on the different subjects that tried it, from a taxi driver to a scientist so I wasn&#039;t sure how to approach it so I just dove in and started writing a short story and ideas were just flowing through my head I could barely keep up. Normally I tend to get writers block easily because of my anxiety disorder and something like xanax only dulls my creativity so 2c-d was my solution. It also happened to improve my skills in gaming. <br /><br />To me 2c-d simply allows you to think in ways you normally wouldn&#039;t sober or even on most type of drugs. It&#039;s very underrated and I hope people start looking more into it, maybe then we&#039;ll get out of this whole ADD/ADHD fiasco..

				Wow Delta, this was really encouraging stuff. Sounds exactly what I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;m really not looking to alter my reality, just alter the mind processes like you described. Is there a vendor on SR you&#039;d recommend?

				I think if you are knowledgeable about the effects of whatever substance you decide to take, and then you DECIDE to take it for whatever reason you have, then I believe it speaks volumes about you because your making the CHOICE to FEEL some way. Why do you like to feel like this? Ask yourself these questions, perhaps(pretty common) some people actually choose to feel a way not really inline with themselves believing they can produce some work of art and because they do this they are more susceptible to getting lost. Not saying this pertains to you, but I&#039;ve been there. I have deliberately tried to use 2c-i, 2c-b, mdma, bk-mdma for the purpose of producing music because those are widely used at edm events and I figured it would help, well it was actually a ridiculously bad idea. The amount of time and work you need to put into making even 16 seconds of a song does not coincide with the effects that any of those chemicals will have on you. Playing video games is a completely different story, counter-strike... omg. <br /><br />&nbsp;Whatever speaks to you, for instance I like ridalin when I need to write because as you know it has the effect of making you alert, hyper, and energetic, those are all things I personally enjoy when I write because that is the type of clarity I want funneled into my writing, it is also the type of person I like to introduce myself to others as.<br /><br />I think for writing small amounts of things are useful, unless you are a world class writer whos published in bookstores then your probably not capable of indulging to the point the substance controls you, however if you take small amounts you can be creative with the feelings that come from the chemicals because your still in control experiencing the effects rather than the effects controlling you and by you I mean your Mind since your a writer. <br /><br />First times are perhaps different if that is the basis of the story, for instance if you decide to write a story about the first time your going to take any drug, then you go about actually writing while your on it in WHATEVER capacity you can then I think that would be interesting. and could even be used later for fiction. <br /><br />
