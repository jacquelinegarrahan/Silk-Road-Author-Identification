It&#039;s suppose to go with the paper facing you, not away!!! Grrrr... <br /><br />Also, when I clip my nails too close, and the skin under the nail splits (this one is my fault though).

				OMG, drobro11 is spot on with people being late!&nbsp; ??? One of my pet hates!!!&nbsp; ::) Really, how hard is it to be on time.&nbsp; ??? I always leave early just in case something happens. I don&#039;t understand some people who leave everything to the last minute or don&#039;t anticipate something going wrong and leave at a time where everything has to fall perfectly into place in order to arrive on time. Always leave early just in case. Sorry for the rant, but I can&#039;t stand lateness when it&#039;s simply just a matter of leaving a little early!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				The old Chip Double Dip. Someone dips a potato chip into a tub of dip, takes a bite, then proceeds to dip the chip in there again. When your at a party, there is always somebody who does this, usually a few. Thing is, when they do it on numerous occasions, they may as well just stick their mouth into the dip. :)
