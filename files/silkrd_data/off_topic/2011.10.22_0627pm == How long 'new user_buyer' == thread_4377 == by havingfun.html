				Hi!<br /><br />As we all know some vendors ask an early finalize with new buyers, but...<br />What do you think...<br />After how many purchases is someone no longer considered as a new user/buyer, when everything went fine (no auto-finalize, etc.)&nbsp; 1? 5? 10? <br />I&#039;m just curious what both sellers as buyers think. <br />:)

				For me , i think 10 order is good to be considered like a &quot;normal&quot; buyer.

				Most vendors that have this restriction require 3-5 orders from what I have seen. 10 seems kind of high to me. I don&#039;t have this restriction and I believe if you do things right it isn&#039;t necessary.

				Main thing is just to be careful.&nbsp; Make sure you check in forums, and be sure it is a reputable vendor.&nbsp; There still seem to be the periodic bad vendor, who preys on new buyers, and talks them into going out of escrow on larger orders.&nbsp; Start small, be cautious, let common sense prevail.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ll get a good rep, soon enough, and then vendors will trust you.&nbsp; They&#039;ve just been hit hard by a few buyers, giving out bad unwarranted feedback, and claiming packages weren&#039;t delivered to blackmail vendors into an xtra order.&nbsp;

				Oh no! ... <br /><br />So far I have placed two orders, and one never made it :(<br /><br />I understand perfectly that trust needs to be built between the seller and customer, and personally am trying as best as I can...<br />But, being from Australia, and our upwardly anal Customs, I guess the risk is inevitable.<br /><br />But so far, almost all the sellers I have spoken to have been great, and the one case where my product didn&#039;t arrive, was taken care of by DopeBoy.<br /><br /><br />Regardless, here&#039;s to hoping that this refund ratio isn&#039;t going to make it harder for me to make any future orders, since I just placed another order&nbsp; :-\

				Yeah ofcourse I understand a (new) buyer needs to built up trust, like a buyer tries to only buy from trustful sellers too. It works two ways. <br />As a new buyer its sometimes hard to know who is to trust and who isnt. I just try to feel whats right and read the forum, but sometimes it isnt a vendors nor buyers &#039;mistake&#039; like @hairyball said...some countries have pain in the ass customs. <br />And ..im sorry for this stupid question to come...but I assume that buying (lets say) about 5 items to built up trust when everything went fine..its not buying those 5 items from 1 seller, but can be 5 different sellers, right? (Yeah, like I said...its a stupid question...just to sure...) :)<br />

				I only ask people with zero transactions to release from escrow early. I&#039;ve sold to 1/0 buyers without any issue and haven&#039;t been burned yet. <br /><br />I might change my &quot;new buyer&quot; policy if/when I get scammed. But for now, I want to help out everyone. :)
