				Hi Everyone!<br />I&#039;m finally going to purchase something on SR this week but after reading through a shitload of posts, listings, Sellers&#039; profiles, etc... I am thinking that in order to have a smooth quick and easy transaction without consequence is to post this message in this forum...&nbsp; I am not wealthy, I make less than $200/week, but I hope to find an honest seller and good product so that (w/ the help of my good friend/investor), I can make a couple smooth transactions, to test the waters, and then in a week or two I will be buying large quantities.&nbsp; I have not used bitcoin, I don&#039;t know how to encrypt an email (but could figure it out), I have no transaction history (and don&#039;t want to buy electronics and the like to gain status as suggested in the welcome letter I got back when I first joined SR), etc... My question is:&nbsp; How can I do this easily and quickly?&nbsp; What steps do I take?&nbsp; Layman&#039;s terms please?&nbsp; And I live in Minnesota USA, have a very good friend who works in the UPS hub near my home, and a Visa debit card account to transfer funds to bitcoin if that is needed.&nbsp; If anyone can be as kind to help a fellow decent human being out with this stuff and hopefully offer some tips and even links to your favorite trusted SR pages or whatever, i will be very appreciative.&nbsp; Also, the product I hope acquire the is first and foremostly MDPV.&nbsp; However I am also looking for LSD, Mescaline, Mushrooms, 2-CE, and if MDPV is too hard to find i&#039;d accept High Quality Methamphetamine, however I am skeptical as to who to trust seeing that Meth has such a bad rap due to the fact that&nbsp; the majority of it&#039;s fans are the bad apples that ruined it for everyone in the first place, and therefore not likely to be easy to get in the mail.&nbsp; Anyways, thanks in advance for any help, suggestions, free samples (lol!) etc...

				Rightio, first of all ditch the idea of using your Visa debit card for anything, what I&#039;d reccomend doing is getting your stack of money together and buying a GreenDot Money Pak from your local store or you can use a website called Mt Gox to deposit money into their account and use that to buy bitcoins.<br /><br />for each of drugs you want, I reccomend checking:<br /><br />&quot;The good LSD vendor thread&quot; and for the other drugs use the search function at the top of the page to see what people are saying about other vendors. <br /><br />with regards to high quality meth there&#039;s also a separate thread on this but there seems to be a lot of high quality meth on silk road for some reason, off the top of my head I believe vortexmilkman is the best.<br /><br />any other queries just give us a shout or if any of my points didnt make sense<br /><br />take it easy mate

				Thanks for the replies so far!&nbsp; And YES!&nbsp; I do want MDPV!&nbsp; Trust me I am experienced and know what i am doing, MDPV is a drug that depending on your mental state,&nbsp; chemical make up in your brain, etc..., is only dangerous to some.&nbsp; Just like LSD.&nbsp; 2 people can cut a line or take a hit from same source of MDPV or LSD as another person, and one can go to&nbsp; a party and then to work, while other may go to the Psychiatric unit in the ER.&nbsp; One thing i&#039;ve discovered is that people that take any of those mental disorder medications (Paxil, Prozac, Abilify, Geodon, etc...) should not do any recreational drugs at all.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a way of begging for a trip to the looney bin!&nbsp; Plus if you&#039;re depressed or have an unhealthy mental state you can&#039;t really get high anyways, at least not enjoyably high.&nbsp; Thanks again you 2!<br /><br />

				lol, out of ALL the choices you have on SR you desperately want MDPV?&nbsp; why MDPV?&nbsp; why not meth or mdma or ANYTHING ELSE?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be a dick, but I have heard nothing but bad things about it.

				I have to take UA&#039;s sometimes so that&#039;s why...&nbsp; Plus I prefer it to meth.&nbsp; Basically I first tried it when I could get Rave On! bath salts at the store.&nbsp; They were cheap, reliable, and better than the best meth i&#039;ve done, then I got Locomotion brand bath salts, which seemed even more powerful than Rave On!&nbsp; and I still passed UA&#039;s!&nbsp; After alot of research i found that Rave On, Locomotion, Cloud 9 and all the other bath salt brands were just MDPV with packaging.&nbsp; After experimenting with the shit and finding I can handle it, here I am...&nbsp; Of course MDPV is only 1 thing I plan to acquire...&nbsp; SR is a dream come true!<br />

				I haven&#039;t tried MDPV, but it sounds interesting. Not all of us tweakers are crazy. :( I&#039;d hold off ordering meth from vortexmilkman for a few days to see whats going on. A few people haven&#039;t got there orders recently. Heisenburg has good crystal too if you decide to go that route.

				MDPV user for over 1year with daily IV usage. LOVED it. Very addictive and was hard to get under control but after a month or so it became my medicine. <br />Work, relationships, family, kids everything was in tact.<br />I am a professional EX Meth head and don&#039;t want to get into that again, with Drug tests at work I can&#039;t risk it.<br />After ban, I went online and quickly got scammed hundreds of dollars. (Western union is the clue).<br />&nbsp;I am struggling with ordering all the other RC&#039;s out there none are like MDPV&gt; <br />Then Silk Road appears. But no MDPV :( <br /><br />Any help?????

				MDPV is a new drug but, after having some experience with it when it was legal up to September 2011 in the US and UK, I can offer some advice for those willing to &#039;go there&#039;.<br /><br />The stuff is potent as hell.<br /><br />I mean it blows all other stims out of the water.<br /><br />The first time I tried it, I bought it in a head shop (while it was still legal, under the brand name &quot;White Rush&quot;, when it was being sold legally as a &quot;bath salt&quot;). The pack was 250mg, a quarter of a gram, and being more used to coke and speed, and knowing my stims in general, I took a regular line. (A long rail). I wish the guy behind the counter who sold me the stuff had warned me but the sleaze bag didn&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />Anyway, it was an instant mind fuck.<br /><br />But in a good way. The aphrodisiac effects of this drug are fucking insane. That&#039;s typical with stims but MDPV is out of control. Problem for me, after I&#039;d banged my girlfriend 3 times and taken the whole 250mg over the course of 6 hours (taking it like an idiot at a rate I was usually accustomed to with coke or speed), I then entered into a 3 day waking nightmare of mind fuckery.<br /><br />Seriously, if you&#039;ve never taken MDPV before, tiny doses are your friend.<br /><br />I spent 3 days awake, no sleep, paranoia, hallucinations, all kinds of terror. In fact, it bordered on psychedelics. After 3 days of no sleep, I found my mind dreaming while awake, such is the body&#039;s need for sleep, and it continued to the point where the waking world got transformed into a dream. Sure, this might sound like a nightmare but it was actually one of the most transformative drug escapades of my life. There was no physical fear for my body, (heart rate normal, blood pressure normal etc) the whole experience was entirely psychic. And despite the terror, I learned a lot of shit about the nature of the reality we perceive from the whole crazy binge.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that first exposure, I approached MDPV from then on with a healthy respect. 150mg for a first time user is enough to keep you stimmed for 24 hours. (It&#039;s too much).&nbsp; 75mg is easily enough for a good night out. The effects last and are persistent.<br /><br />Do not re dose after that amount no matter how &quot;moreish&quot; it might seem.<br /><br />Over time, I got used to the stuff and can say it&#039;s better than coke, meth, speed and all other stims. You just have to treat it with respect. One of the funny things about MDPV is the comedown. There is no crash per se. When you&#039;ve had enough, you know. And the lingering effects of the drug in the comedown phase lead to a new stage of the experience... total mental clarity. You see shit clearly. It&#039;s almost like acid. The comedown itself is &quot;energized wakefulness&quot; as to the nature of your particular reality.<br /><br />I never found the need to take it again for many weeks after. Once a month is a healthy treat. The experience, for me, was so total, that it&#039;s not something worth doing all the time.<br /><br />MDPV is potent shit but definitely a drug experience worth having at least once in your life if you like stimulants and are partial to a dopamine flood in your synapses.<br /><br />Approach with caution. It&#039;s not for everyone and I agree with the above poster when he said &quot;Just like LSD.&nbsp; 2 people can cut a line or take a hit from the same source of MDPV as another person, and one can go to a party and then to work, while the other may go to the Psychiatric unit in the ER.&quot;<br /><br />Stupid people overdoing it and winding up in the ER (as usual 5% of user idiots of any drug) got this drug a 1 year ban by the DEA pending &quot;investigation&quot; which means we&#039;ll never see it available legally again. I wish the assholes that ban shit knew the real statistics of the typical ER. 60% of admissions on a Friday and Saturday night are alcohol related and yet no media outlet creates a shit storm looking for that drug to be banned.<br /><br />Be careful out there. <br /><br />That&#039;s my mind dump.<br /><br />

				Hey CocaCola:<br />Just wanted to send some karma your way for a well thought out Errowid quality report on the +&#039;s and -&#039;s of your trips without any preconceived prejudices. Mega props.<br /><br />We&#039;re all adults here (I hope) who can make their own decisions, but the best decisions are informed ones. I had a friend who regularly abused Humulin for the toxicity high/and anabolic effects. No matter how many of us tried to talk him out of it, and it eventually took his life.&nbsp; We all mourned his loss, but we all moved on in life a little easier because we had all made the effort to inform him as best we could.

				Doctor PV here m.d. i kinda feel like a private tutor er whos stumbled into a classroom where his students are studying together. hi all. dont know how i got here anyway im trying to start&nbsp; a business selling mdpv because I believed there are many people like myself who&nbsp; use it daily or weekly without all the problems you read about and live a normal life. some of you confirm that belief and i think there area many more. I think we all realized what a good thing we had when we found it learned how to use it and kept quiet hoping it wouldn&#039;t go away or become illegal. Even though Ive been using it almost daily for over a year i don&#039;t find it addicting at all. i could leave it alone with&nbsp; no problem any time. With meth and coke id do it till it was gone and then want more. plus with pv i can function around other people&nbsp; which wasn&#039;t really so with meth or coke. and one&nbsp; more thing i could get just as high snorting it as i could shooting it in fact i prefer snorting it. which is a big plus for having no veins so i think good mdpv is a good thing and I&#039;m here with you all and for you all if you need me. I have a good connection and my next batch will be even better. Didn&#039;t mean to advertise here. it is what it is. BTW CocaCola Id like to use some of your lines as&nbsp; advertisement in my page for people who&#039;ve never tried it. what do you think?&nbsp; is that possible?
