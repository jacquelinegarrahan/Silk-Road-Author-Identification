				I get queasy and irritated when I hear cliches about &quot;patriotism&quot; and the like. And I hate suburban oldfags who dress up like 1970s NYC leather boys and ride motorcycles. So the Fourth of July is a lame day <br /><br />I don&#039;t like being expected to deal with adults who dress up in weird costumes. <br /><br />It&#039;s one of those tawdry but nonetheless disruptive and nasty little &quot;fuck yous&quot; that people are all about today. Some middle aged rich guy dresses up like Rob Halford to make other people deal with it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really fit in anywhere. I&#039;m lucky however in that I&#039;ve been able to find some people I can associate with who share common interests. People are pretty &#039;&#039;genuine&#039;&#039; here in comparative terms, everybody is just suspicious of everybody else. Middle class people too have become very bizarre, and their whole worldview/culture seems like an affectation.<br /><br />I find myself in odd circumstances because I get on fine with working-class people but I&#039;m not one of them psychologically and I find myself alienated from what would be my own demographic.&nbsp; What&#039;s your average white man with a professional degree? Some disengaged workaholic or a brain-dead liberal who is into buying stuff and sex etc.

				Patriotism is a cunt, presumably you&#039;re not just trying to incite a rise from patriots I definitely agree with you Joywind.

				Honestly, you&#039;re not alone in your feelings there. I don&#039;t enjoy the kind of patriotism that we commonly see touted on Independence Day in America. It&#039;s total bullshit.<br /><br />Like, we&#039;re a world community and America&#039;s still got this childish &quot;fuck you we&#039;ve got guns and beer and freedom&quot; thing going on, and that&#039;s what gets celebrated? For years I&#039;ve been one of those kinds of people who was mildly patriotic and found everything normal to be okay. Fireworks? Of course it&#039;s patriotic! Alcohol? You bet! Rudeness? That&#039;s a staple!<br /><br />But where does all that nonsense end? What does that have to do with a sovereign nation?<br /><br />I still love Independence Day. It&#039;s late now, but don&#039;t let those issues ruin your day/weekend. Know what you think of the United States of America and why, and you&#039;ll find a certain sense of pride of at least being alive and learned enough to hold that in your mind.

				Say goodbye to patriotism, it&#039;s an anachronistic thing anyway. Brings up nothing but negative emotions related to nationalism, jingoism and xenophobia.<br /><br />Like we needed any more of that!<br /><br />goblin
