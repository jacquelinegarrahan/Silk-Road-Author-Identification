				My dog lived to be 15 and she started going blind her last couple years. That lil bitch loved her some good marijuana smoke. She would eat the air when the smoke billowed around her. What a sight it was. I miss her so.

				I have 2 cats, one hates weed, she always leaves the room when I toke up. My other cat loves weed, she come running when she smells me smoking it and likes to be near me or on my lap when im smoking. Pretty sure she gets a buzz off it, sometimes I share the second hand with her. She gets all hyper and crazy for like 30 mins after I smoke it and then she just lays around for a couple hours :p

				My cat is always smelling my weed fumes, he mostly seems to enjoy it. He becomes all mellow, and there is something in his dilated look that makes me think he is tripping hard. He got anxious a few times though, but I managed to calm him down by petting him. Cats are awesome to pet on drugs. Also I&#039;ve been considering to feed him a tiny amount of shrooms, but I&#039;m not sure he would appreciate it since cats have no concept of self.
