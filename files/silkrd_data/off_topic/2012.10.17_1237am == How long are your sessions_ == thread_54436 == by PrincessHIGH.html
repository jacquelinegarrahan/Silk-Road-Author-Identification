				As the topic says, I&#039;ve heard about week long benders, was wondering how common this is? For me, my fun, which is generally consists of quality coke in good measures, copious amounts of alcohol, and a smattering of high grade indica, stops at day two, so my sessions are usually about 36 hours. How about you? :)

				I have this theory about getting high.<br /><br />In my personal experience, a few friends of mine like to get so off their tits, that they cant function propperly.<br /><br />For example, if i know that to enjoy myself, i need 250 mg of mdma, thats how much i will take, to get to a lovely state/roll<br /><br />My friends however, love to get &quot;Mashed-up&quot;, so much so that (in my opinion) , which isnt my style.<br /><br />Having said that, i once went&nbsp; four day mdma/weed/coke binge,&nbsp; starting the day with a joint, having a few lines of coke for lunch, and mdma once the coke wore off...<br /><br />

				I take drugs to have fun.&nbsp; Binging for multiple days with no sleep is the opposite of fun, imo.&nbsp; The longest I&#039;ve gone is 2 days... maybe I just can&#039;t handle it?&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m not so dumb to try?

				I have never even stayed up more than 24 hours in my life. That includes meth bomb rolls, Music festivals, MDMA usage and what not.<br /><br /><br />That 24 hours includes no drugs too. I value my sleep far too much.

				The key to any binge is not to neglect the simple things you would normally do.<br />Eat, shower,take rest periods and take supplements when possible, while staying hydrated.<br />If you get in a shower and in 2 minutes your fingers are already pruny, you are dehydrated take a cold shower for as last as you can stand it and grab the largest container for water that will fit into your fridge.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad

				Excluding cannabis, I&#039;ve never done more than 1 dose (dose varies of course and includes mixing chemicals) in a row. I was high nonstop for over a year but cannabis doesn&#039;t mean shit for a binge haha
