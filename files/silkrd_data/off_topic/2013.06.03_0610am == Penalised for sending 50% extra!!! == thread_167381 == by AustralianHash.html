				So when i can, i usually throw in some extra kiff weed with the already overweighted amount of top quality stuff i sell, and i clearly say that the kiff is a free extra in the product description. This weekend somebody ordered 1 gram, so i gave them 1.2 gram of the good stuff, and about 0.4 grams of kiff.<br /><br />He received it today, and only gave me 4 out of 5 because it was &quot;kiffy&quot;.<br /><br />WTF.<br /><br />Is there anyway of telling who that sale went to? I cant remember the order, so i cant msg him to ask him to maybe give me 5 instead, and silk road seems to delete order details as soon a i click posted. Alternatively i would also like to not sell to anybody who can&#039;t actually read the description or weigh his order himself, can i work out who is was so i can black list him?

				I thought vendors could see who leaves them feedback?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only left less then a 5 a couple times and each time I was messaged right away.&nbsp; So I assumed vendors could see exactly who leaves them feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seems like vendors would have some sort of feedback history like users and be able to see what who left them which feedback.&nbsp; I imagine they do since many people seem to get messaged right away when leaving anything less then 5.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any veterans out there know how this works?<br /><br />@AustralianHash --&nbsp; the user who left you a 4 of 5 complained about your product not being trimmed and being kiffy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how someone could tell what kind of trimming was done on a gram of pot, so that seems kind of weird to say.&nbsp; &nbsp; When they say kiffy, is that the same as kief or kiffy like shake?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t trim, fine, some people don&#039;t trim, but don&#039;t hide it, just let people know.&nbsp; I can tell you I am more likely to leave a bad review when a seller mis-represents their products.&nbsp; Anyway best of luck, if your honest and your product is okay you&#039;ll be fine.

				Yeah kiffy like shake.....i grow my own, and trim it very well, but you always end up with an ounce or so of shake, so i can either throw it away or give it away free....i assume he meant it was not trimmed because he assumed all the shake was leaves which fell off the order or something, but if he had bothered to weigh it, or alternatively just read the fucking description, he would have known it was free extra. Oh well, live and learn, no good deed goes unpunished as they say
