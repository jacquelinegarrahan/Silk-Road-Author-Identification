				I know its challenging to grow Peyote (and it takes forever) and the markets nothing like MDMA/Coke, but I&#039;m genuinely curious why it&#039;s impossible to find mescaline on SR.<br /><br />I found a two clearnet sites selling live Peyote plants within Canada*, but I did the math and it costs about $100 to get high once.<br /><br />It&#039;s making my plans to try every drug once more complicated.<br /><br />*regarding canada law, its legal to grow the cactus but illegal to extract the mescaline

				Its not profitable. Growing to a larger size takes about 5 years. You will spend more taking care of it then you will get from selling it. Its only worthwhile if you are located in a place where you can grow outside.

Growing from seed, 5 years will yield a plant about 4-5 cm in diameter. You might get some small offshoot buttons in that period of time, but certainly not enough to consume and get a decent trip. It&#039;s unfortunate, I wish there was a lot more availability of Peyote than there is. Heck, I wish I had known like 5 years ago that a place like silk road would exist, I would have been much more diligent about rooting a bunch of buttons so that I&#039;d be able to offer some type of quantity to the road! Even still, that would only appeal to people looking to start a small Peyote garden, whereas it seems like most people would just want the finished product.

				Better to just travel to South America, go up in the mountains of say Peru and find the cacti growing naturally. <br /><br />Cut, cook, trip. <br /><br />Also, maybe consider checking out the San Pedro cactus, it&#039;s legal and costs much less to obtain and trip off of it. Very easy to cook too<br /><br />

				I have a San Pedro growing. Bought it about 8 years ago. It was about 8 cm back then. Now it has reached over 1.2 meter. <br /><br />However I do not want to eat it, because it almost feels like it has become a part of me. <br />So I&#039;m planning to just let it grow. <br /><br />I also have 1.4 grams of synth mescaline laying around. Last summer I tried 450 mg and it was just amazing. <br />Such a wonderful experience, so peaceful and lovely. <br /><br />I can advise everyone to take at least one mescaline trip in their lives.
