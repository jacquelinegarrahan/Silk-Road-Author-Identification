				I want to vote for Jill Stein (Green Party) because I agree with the majority of her policy line issues and she refused to accept PAC and corporate funding. Also, Harvard graduate. But I will end up voting Gary Johnson and encourage everyone I can to do so. In the General Election if Libertarian party can pull 5% it will be a tremendous message to the current Two Party duopoly that they will need to adopt the principles of personal liberty and free markets in order to garner that additional 5% in the next election cycle. <br /><br />I was a county coordinator for Ron Paul within my State and was a delegate captain at our conventions. It has been very disenchanting process being &quot;inaugurated&quot; into the Republican Party even on a local level. I ran for our precinct committee captain position (lost) but I still attend the Central Committee meetings to curbstomp all those old fucks and continue to promote a lot of platform issues the Paul campaign ran on. <br /><br />In reality I don&#039;t see Obama or Romney as different policy makers; they have the same boss: Federal Reserve Bank. What the brilliant scheme of Republicrats does is split the population with emotional civil issues like Gays, Religion and Abortion - You&#039;ll see they never talk fiscal and monetary reform nor sustainability of American military intervention. It keeps the sheep bickering while the wolves cash their fucking checks. <br /><br />One of the best political quotes I&#039;ve heard was actually coined by Chris Rock: <br /><br />&quot;Republicans are fuckin&#039; idiots. Democrats are fuckin&#039; idiots. Conservatives are idiots. Liberals are idiots. Anyone that makes up they mind before they hear duh issue, is a fuckin&#039; fool. Okay. Everyone is always wanting to be down with the gang. I&#039;m a conservative. I&#039;m a liberal... Be a fuckin&#039; person. Listen. Let is swirl around your head. Then, form your opinion. No decent person is one thing or the other. I got some shit I&#039;m conservative about. I got some shit I&#039;m liberal about.&quot;

				There&#039;s not enough difference between the candidates for voting to be worth the effort.<br />Different wings of the same fascist-ass bird, et cetera.<br />I prefer using my time resisting the urge to go grammar-, spelling-, and fact-Nazi on hastily regurgitated NYT editorials...<br />though, for the record, no one can be entitled to someone else&#039;s property.

				Nobody really knows what Romney would do as president.&nbsp; His record when he was governor of MA compared to the positions that he&#039;s advocating now is a complete 180.&nbsp; As governor, he seemed to be a reasonable guy.&nbsp; As presidential candidate, he seems to be more of a wingnut.&nbsp; How much of what he says does he actually believe, and how much of what he says is just bullshit meant to &quot;energize the base&quot; and get him elected? <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m not a US citizen, I just live here, so I won&#039;t be voting for any of them.&nbsp; Hope you guys don&#039;t fuck it up!

				I always hear how THIS election is the most important we will face. That has been true of EVERY election in the past. They are all important, but what people fail to realize is that the presidential campaigning is covering up the issues, not addressing them. The fact is that it doesn&#039;t matter who is in that particular seat, they are both already bought and paid for due to the two party BS system we have here. The real issue is who are you going to put into congress to actually write the bills that the president simply signs. If congress isn&#039;t acting in your interest, the president isn&#039;t going to change that. The economy isn&#039;t the presidents fault any more than it is MY fault for not spending my dollars locally. And a Romney tax plan that lowers the rate of taxation without cutting taxes and closes loopholes for extra deductions that will cause a net ZERO change in revenue, sounds like he is on a political rocking chair.<br /><br />&quot;I am going to change everything so that things will remain the same&quot; <br /><br />Fuck off!<br /><br />tax rates don&#039;t create jobs, and any politician who says they can create private sector jobs with any law or policy or deregulation is just plain full of shit.<br /><br />people create jobs, not politicians! They do it by having money, and they get their money by selling things to people who work to make more money. I have NEVER heard a businessman say that he created a job because his taxes got lowered, but I have heard of businessmen hiring because they can&#039;t fill their current demand with their current staff. <br /><br />I&#039;m getting off track, my point is that it doesn&#039;t matter who the president is if congress if masturbating for their entire elected term, and that is what effects the American people, so I will make ridiculous remarks like &quot;write in wretched&quot; because thinking about any actual difference between the candidates is mind numbing at best, so we should at least be able to have some fun with our drug addled minds!

				I wouldn&#039;t call Ron Paul the ideal candidate. He does have some good ideas on the role of government, taxes, law enforcement, and drug policy, but man is he a racist fuck, and wants to move us back to the 50&#039;s in terms of non existent equality, and &quot;values&quot;. but he is the better of the evils on personal freedom, and a few other nuggets, but I really don&#039;t want and old fart like him in the whitehouse. Can you image the shuffleboard tournaments at diplomatic events....not to mention if war should erupt after 9 p.m. he would be fast asleep when he needs to react. and foreign policy that is similar to yelling at the neighborhood kids when they get on his lawn.<br /><br />I joke of course, I do think we would have been a valuable choice, but to lead the nation, He is just way off in a couple of key points.

There is plenty of blame to be laid at his feet, but not EVERYTHING is the presidents fault.<br /><br />remember all the criticism Obama got for moving his convention speech indoors &quot;due to weather&quot;? the republicans delayed their convention due to weather, but Obama can&#039;t keep his speech out of the rain without being called a liar. And what does moving a speech indoors tell you his ability to conduct himself on the world stage or make decisions about national security?<br /><br />republicans want Obama to &quot;run on his record&quot; but they want Romney to run on the imagined &quot;record&quot; of his future, but avoid his past record.<br /><br />Ryan blames Obama for not enacting policy that he voted against, and he asked for government money that he voted against offering.<br /><br />Romney bashes a healthcare bill that was modeled after one he created because Obama made it<br /><br />Romney bashes a welfare waiver that he endorsed because Obama did it<br /><br />I know this sounds pro Obama and Anti-Romney, but rest assured, I think they are both equally evil and corrupt.

				<br /><br />Us Brits love Obama. Such a cool bastard. <br /><br />He&#039;s been ineffectual because of the Republican conspiracy to scupper his first term. Vote him in with a huge majority and I think he&#039;ll kick ass.

All I pointed out is that the giant douche has gone to great lengths to hide the truth about his past. These idiots that regurgitate some bullshit they hear about how well educated Obama is or whatever there is no proof of that. He wasn&#039;t even a professor of constitutional law, he was a guest lecturer. Obama is a fraud, as you pointed out in all the lies he told to get the job he has now. Also who the fuck is Barry Sotero?
