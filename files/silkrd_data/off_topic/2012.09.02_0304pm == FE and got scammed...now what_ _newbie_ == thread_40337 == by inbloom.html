				I don&#039;t like being the bearer of bad news. However, once an order is finalized, there is nothing that can be done to get your money back.<br /><br />My advice would be to buy from vendors that don&#039;t require FE. Some vendors will take a chance on a newbie. Order small quantities that are inexpensive and that will help establish your reputation as a buyer, while at the same time minimizing your risk of losing money.<br /><br />Best of luck

				My first order was through the same vendor and he requested the same. I was one of his first customers and everything came out fine, both quantity and quality. He was also great in responding to messages.<br /><br />I&#039;ve since learned a new vendor is not supposed to require FEs on orders until they have a certain amount of successful transactionsâ€”35 I believe.<br /><br />I know my comments don&#039;t help your situation, but perhaps the vendor will resurface. He may have had a personal issue come up that has caused him to go inactive.<br /><br />Other than that, I&#039;d stick to the vendors with stellar ratings, and as already mentioned, keep your orders small for awhile.

You cannot do anything and SR Admin can&#039;t help you. If you follow the simple rule of NEVER FE for anyone or for any reason, you&#039;ll be fine. :) There are threads on here which talk about how to build up your purchase history because that is something vendor&#039;s really look at when you place an order (and rightly so). There are times on SR when a deal seems so good that a buyer&#039;s judgement is clouded and through a momentary loss of reality as they dream of receiving this awesome deal in the mail without a hitch, they FE, only to get scammed. Sorry, but it seems you&#039;ve learned an expensive lesson.

				Like everyone else has said, there&#039;s nothing you or anyone else can do. He most likely took your money and ran. You really should find vendors that don&#039;t FE(there&#039;s plenty, just look around :)). If they do require FE, don&#039;t buy large amounts and check the rumor mill section of the forum to make sure there are no viable complaints against him/her!

				i&#039;m gladdened to see the increased emphasis on keeping it in escrow recently<br /><br />it&#039;s how this place runs. i understand vendors have their reasons to require FE but ultimately the less FE the better for everyone

				my opinion is vendor requires FE, then he doesn&#039;t want my money. There are plenty of vendors to choose from, find one who cares about their customers

				I wont be giving up on SR &amp; happy to say that my second purchase experience was a great one (different vendor)!&nbsp; I guess at first I felt like a kid in a candy store and let my excitement get the best of me... should have explored a bit first.&nbsp; I&#039;ll chalk-it-up as an expensive lesson learned :&#039;(&nbsp; Thanks you all for the helpful (and gentle) feedback!

				There has only been one circumstance in which I have finalised early. There is this one vendor who happens to be the only domestic vendor on Silkroad selling the drug I want, and I am uncomfortable ordering internationally for this particular product. I have had successful transactions with him in the past, but now he insists on early finalisation. I don&#039;t want to run the risk of losing business with him. It&#039;s either finalise early, or potentially not getting the drug at all from anyone.

				If you have done good business with him in the past and he is now requiring FE, move on to another vendor. International shouldn&#039;t be an absolute deal breaker. Give the international guys a chance. Many people here can attest to having good luck internationally. 3 of my last 4 orders came from the Netherlands.

				...it mightn&#039;t be about having &#039;good luck shipping internationally&#039;, it may just be that because of the increased waiting times, and more avenues for a package to go down the further it travels, the easiest way for a buyer to minimalise this potential risk is by sticking domestically. <br /><br />I&#039;d LOVE to stick domestic for Cannabis, but I find the price v quality just cannot be established here in the UK (or, in order to do so, I&#039;d have to order quantities that I can&#039;t afford in one go). <br /><br />It&#039;s a very hard decision to make, psyche - see if you could work out a private deal seeing as you&#039;ve had transactions go by in the past with success (from both seller end delivering and buyer end finalising).

				Take the kick in the balls and learn from it.&nbsp; Check out the forums to research any vendor you haven&#039;t made a purchase from before, for reliability and quality of product - I&#039;ve been lucky enough to have never been scammed outright, but first purchase was some bunk acid that I bought cos - kid in a candy store style - price was too good to be true.&nbsp; Then I checked the forums...
