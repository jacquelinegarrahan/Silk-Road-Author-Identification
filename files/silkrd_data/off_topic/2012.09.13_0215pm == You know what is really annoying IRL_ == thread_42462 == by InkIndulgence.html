				When you have to take off work for a doctor&#039;s appointment at 8am that you have to leave at 7am for because the office is on the other side of town, and when you get there they tell you that the doctor called in sick and someone should have called you. <br /><br />Oh you are out of your medication and were expecting a refill? Well we&#039;ll see what other doctors are available and call you so you can take off work again drive back over here to pick up the script and take it to the pharmacy. No no we can&#039;t just CALL a refill into a pharmacy for your convenience why would we do that? Oh but you still have to see your main doctor so lets reschedule you for next week when you will have to take off of work yet again and drive another hour in 8am traffic to get here.<br /><br />System.out.println( myInsuranceSucks(true) );

				You get to bill them for the missed appointment right? I mean they bill you when you miss one, so they should get a bill for the same!

				Fuck most medical centers. Sooo many bad experiences. I may have finally found one that I don&#039;t hate but there&#039;s so many places where the doctors don&#039;t give a shit. The nurses don&#039;t give a shit. And the receptionists give like negative shits--as if the go out of their way to fuck with you.<br /><br />The SR pharmacy isn&#039;t half bad though ;)<br /><br />Hope you can get things worked out and your boss isn&#039;t a dick about it.

				Yea me too what snoop said. Every body else in my family has insurance and clinics and they are all prisoners of that. Sometimes i feel sorry for them and at other times I wish i was right back in that prison with them. None the less tho didn&#039;t mean to come off like a whiney baby shit I am truely free. They can&#039;t even smoke a joint and pot in my opinion is the only medicine that is worth taking but it has sky rocketed and I knew it would once it started being legal. I gota start a fund to get moved to a state where it&#039;s legal
