				Hello there naughty silk roaders.<br /><br />Well I have come by a set of bank details with access to lots of cash, want this evil person to suffer for their wrongs, so have their account number, sort code and bank, card number expiry date and security number, also full address and full name.<br /><br />Is anybody interested in this or could find a way to access money or make a purchase?<br />It would come at a price obviously as i would want there to be something in it for me.<br /><br />This is legitimate if anyone is doubting.<br />I would not normally do this,&nbsp; however this person has wronged me.<br /><br />Let me know!!! ;P

				Funny, I too, was wronged by someone, and my job made it possible to get their info, everything EXCEPT for the 3 digit code on the back of the card, but I have their zip code, which you can use and say the 3digit number is worn off. I have their Phone #, Address, zip code, and CC #. <br />I would also like to see this person suffer. <br />I had originally planned on using that card info to buy a shitload of bTC, but by the time I joined, there was no way to get them with a CC. <br />So, if there IS someone out there who doesn&#039;t like rich asshole fuckwads, i will give you the info for a VERY small price. Worth more to me to see it get maxxed out!

				You two appear to be in the wrong place. From the seller guide:<br /><br />&quot;Restricted items<br />Please do not list anything who&#039;s purpose is to harm or defraud, such as stolen items or info, stolen credit cards, counterfeit currency, personal info, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction (chemical/bio weaponry, nukes, and anything used to make them). &quot;

				You guys can PM me. I know exactly what to do as long as you have the information it will work out fine. We already have a website specifically for this purpose. We can make charges for merchandise but there is no merchandise we just get the cash. This has worked multiple times in the past even after the authorities find out they cant do anything. As long as we have enough time to move the money we can keep all the stuff we get.

				I am not a seller, so I didn&#039;t read the seller guide. I just read the buyers guide. And that was on SR, not on the forums. <br />But I hear ya, I will follow the laws of this lawless netherverse.

				You can just talk to me in PM and I will take care of it. But you need the 3 digit code. The area code is very helpful but what your describing means someone would need to make a physical copy of the card then take the duplicate into stores and use it. Because we cant use it online without the security code.

				Silk Road is like the government. He doesn&#039;t want anyone making money off something unless he is too. They dont allow the sale of information like that because it wouldn&#039;t really be profitable for Silk Road only the person that bought the information. Even the stuff Silk Road does to stop scams all have profits at heart. For instance the new pin number to stop phishing attacks. Basically phishers were draining all the money on SR by sending it off Silk Road. So in response Silk Road added the pin. So now phishers have to funnel the money through a vendor account to steal it and Silk Road still gets his 6.25% cut. Everything he does is about money. The reason Silk Road doesn&#039;t do more to stop scams is because its not in his best interest. I agree with his entire line of thinking.

				Yes SR do not condone activity which promotes the harm of others. You can read in the Terms of Service about the moral stance. You can sell whatever you want, but if SR finds out and ban you, please don&#039;t come here ranting and says you weren&#039;t aware mate.

SR does condone activity that promotes the harm of others. SR sells weapons and drugs lol. But just as others have said SR doesnt condone the sale of stuff that he doesnt make money on lol. The only reason SR doesnt allow carders is because he wouldnt be making much money. It has nothing to do with morals.
