				I keep seing commercials for the new movie The Hobbit. I dont really care for these kinds of movies but it looks like a bad ass movie. Is anyone else thinking of watching this movie? If not The Hobbit what movies look good that are in the box office right now?

				I love the LOTR films. Went to see The Hobbit on saturday, 3D IMAX... it&#039;s a good film, definitely worth watching, but I didn&#039;t like it as much as the LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />It had a much different feel to it compared to LOTR - more childish I think, but I guess that&#039;s how the Hobbit is anyway (the book I mean). I didn&#039;t like the higher amount of CGI characters either. I loved all the Orcs, Goblins and Uruk-Hai in LOTR - where they were normal actors with lots of silicon/make-up on... That looked 100% more &quot;realistic&quot; and believable to me than even the most advanced CGI.<br /><br />It&#039;ll probably grow on me though.

				Agree with above post, I didn&#039;t feel like I was watching a badass war movie, it&#039;s just like the book in a sense that it shows how LOTR came about and how everyone is connected with one another, reading the book would give you better insight just as reading The Hunger Games trilogies would let you know things that the movie missed.<br /><br />I still liked the movie. 7/10 for me!

Don&#039;t know which Star Wars films I&#039;ve seen, and the ones I have, only once or twice, or maybe only bits of them, being on the tv in the background when I was a kid or something. I think the one with Jah Jah Binks is the one I know the most, and I&#039;ve heard that&#039;s one most people hate.

				You people who ignore the classics are sad, just plain old fucking sad. Get the hell on The Pirate Bay and download these movies, I beg of you, none of you have any clue at all what you&#039;re missing!! It takes years for hundreds of people to get together and create these films, all of their ideas and effort get put into these works of art, please do not ignore them! :&#039;(<br /><br />http://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx/

The reason I haven&#039;t seen them yet is because I&#039;m &quot;saving&quot; them for &quot;the right moment&quot; (...or something). I&#039;m very OCD with films/music etc. - If I&#039;m going to watch a film I&#039;m really excited about, or one that has amazing reviews (i.e. these classics) - I&#039;ll make sure I only watch it when I&#039;m in a good mood and have good food/drinks to enjoy it with.<br /><br />I have started to realise though that doing this has caused me to delay watching them for way too long. I just need to whack them on.

In fact, I think I heard once that Tolkien wrote that one more for kids, compared to LOTR. And as for it being boring... I think it was always gonna suffer criticism of being more boring now that we&#039;ve gotten used to LOTR, as those films culminated in a HUGE FUCKING EPIC BATTLE, whereas the Hobbit is... a quest to reclaim a mountain and take some gold. Pretty measly in comparison.<br /><br />So I was always expecting it to be that way I think. What disappointed me though is just how different it feels to LOTR. I didn&#039;t like all the CGI-ness, mainly of the Pale Orc.<br /><br />Peter Jackson actually wanted to do more CGI in LOTR, but was restricted by budget. I&#039;m so glad he was. He wanted even to make the Nazgul CGI...&nbsp; &nbsp;why?! They look awesome just as they are. Simple, black cloaks with a bit of armour. If that fabric was CGI... ergh, would&#039;ve been so much worse IMO.<br /><br />The orcs/goblins/uruk-hai looked AWESOME to me in LOTR, all being silicon/make-up faces on real human actors. They were so much more believable/realistic to me that way.

I&#039;m gonna make another thread about this one.
