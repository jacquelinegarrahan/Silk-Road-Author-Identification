				Well the question you&#039;re asking is extremely general and subjective.&nbsp; I would assume though that there wouldn&#039;t be as many vendors as there are on SR if they weren&#039;t making money.<br /><br />Make your question more specific or provide more details about your specific situation or else you probably won&#039;t get any good answers.

				I dont understand how anyone can ship bud overseas at large quantities, isn&#039;t it too obvious&nbsp; to send by mail.

				Yeah everybody knows vendors don&#039;t make profit. They just barely break even and take a huge risk of international drug trafficking and 20+ years in prison for some petty online popularity with some people they will never even meet.

				Of course people make money here, or this place wouldn&#039;t be around.<br /><br /><br /><br />If vendors make no cash they leave, no vendors = no buyers. No buyers = no fees. No fees = no money for DPR and the team.

				Are you serious? Look at the fucking prices of drugs then compare that to what it sells for in your area...<br /><br />And no shit vendors make profit. Do you think people drug deal for fun?<br /><br /><br />Even though it is kind of fun....

				you all got me wrong here. Since the term making money is generic ill break it down. when i say do vendors make money i mean stack for 1-2yrs and get the fuck outta here money. combined with a street business does SR add a significant value to revenue? as a big man know what i mean.
