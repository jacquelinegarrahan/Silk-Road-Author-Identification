				My pops taught me how to shoot when I was seven. I couldn&#039;t even look because the loud sound used to scare me.<br /><br />Since I obviously turned out fine, can I sell a gun to my 15 y/o neighbor ? I&#039;m moving away and need to sell my gear. <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry it&#039;s no AK, just an old Glock. I would give it really cheap and even learn him about how to take care of it and stuff.<br /><br />I know he&#039;s not 18 but c&#039;mon, we all went shooting before we were of legal age, right ? Hell, I got my first one at 12 and look at me now, GPG and all that jazz.<br /><br />The way I see it, if he doesn&#039;t get it from me, he&#039;ll still want it and I&#039;m a better choice than those shady tweakers who will rob him or worse.<br /><br />Not to mention, who am I to judge if somebody is ready for a gun. It&#039;s a free world, right ?

Yeah but YOU are YOU and YOU control YOUR actions. Kudos for not shooting someone, well done, bonus point for you. However this kid ISN&#039;T YOU and you can&#039;t guarantee he wont try and act the big man with it or pull it out and accidentally shoot someone if some nextman gives them shit OR even worse pull a fucking Columbine if they are a complete nutball. Don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;m not anti gun here at all. I just think selling a gun that can be traced back to you to a 15 year old is bloody stupid.

				I had guns when I was that age too. But the difference is my dad bought them for me, and taught me how to properly use and respect them. If the kid&#039;s parents are fine with him having it, then sell it to them, and they can let him have it. If a 15 year old wants a gun that he has to own under the radar, I can almost certainly guarantee he&#039;s not going to do anything responsible with it. At best, he&#039;s going to use it for bragging points, and potentially hurt someone (or one of his stupid friends will). At worst, he&#039;s planning the next Columbine. A few bucks are never worth it.

Actually I misinterpreted it, he didn&#039;t shoot no one, the double negative from the didn&#039;t / no cancels out the n&#039;t and the no so we are left with he did shoot one. So depending on how you interpret his sentence he could have shot zero to an arbitrary number of people, seems strange that this could imply improper use of a firearm since it holds true for everybody.

Serial number in tact? I had both rifles and pistols throughout my childhood, and have no problems if his parents know/approve and it goes through a licensed dealer for a small fee.

Actually I misinterpreted it, he didn&#039;t shoot no one, the double negative from the didn&#039;t / no cancels out the n&#039;t and the no so we are left with he did shoot one. So depending on how you interpret his sentence he could have shot zero to an arbitrary number of people, seems strange that this could imply improper use of a firearm since it holds true for everybody.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This actually made me laugh.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Neither firearms nor (most) drugs hurt people, stupidity in how they are used do.<br /><br />The big difference is a minor getting drugs from SR is safer in several aspects than how they will get them elsewhere, and they will get them, or worst get an unknown substance they assumed was a different drug. SR vendors are also very helpful in providing recommended usage and dosage for their products.<br /><br />A pistol is still a pistol and isn&#039;t any safer regardless of where it came from.

				Yeah I mean don&#039;t get me wrong, I am all for the free market thing. If you want a gun, buy a gun but selling a gun to a 15 year old is just stupid. At the most you should sell it to his parents so they can supervise him with it and show him how to use it responsibly. Guns kill people a lot more than drugs do, in fact that is what guns are designed for. I&#039;m not saying your neighbor is stupid but why take the risk? And I know for a fact if I had a 15 year old kid and found out someone sold a gun to him I would take the gun and come looking for you with it. If you sold it to me so I could supervise my kid with it, whole different kettle of fish.
