				Hey guys,<br /><br />I got this coke the other day (big rocks and it was real shiney and had that nice shimer to it that good coke has.. But the quality was not there, when we cooked it it cam back to 30%.. It was obviously cut with benzocaine or something cause made you extremely numb straight away..<br /><br />I was wondering if anyone knew of how they could keep the gloss/shine on the rocks when it was obviously just re-pressed?? This wasn&#039;t a small sparkle, the gloss looked great! But was still very hard from it being reblocked..
