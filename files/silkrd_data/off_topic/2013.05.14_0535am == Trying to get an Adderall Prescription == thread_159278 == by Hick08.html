				I think I might legitimately have ADHD, and I have tried adderall before and it seemed to help A LOT. I was able to focus and everything was good. I am planning on going to a psychiatrist in a couple days to see if I can get an adderall prescription. I don&#039;t really want to deal with the doctor prescribing a bunch of other shit drugs to try first, I just want adderall.<br /><br />So do you think the best way to do this would be to tell him that I have tried adderall illegally before and that I think it helped?<br /><br />Or should I come up with some bullshit story and say that a few years ago I was prescribed adderall, but then the doctor that I was going to retired and I decided to go off of the adderall, and now that I&#039;m in college I am seeing the effects of ADHD again, and would like to try adderall again.<br /><br />Oppinions?<br /><br />I&#039;m in the USA by the way.

				Considering college age kids are going to be the at the top of the Dr&#039;s radar for &quot;what to watch out for&quot;, I&#039;d be careful with the stories you makeup. You may want to consider seeing your GP instead of a psychiatrist, a psychiatrist probably won&#039;t write you a Rx without first counseling, although that may be a good route depending on what issues you are having.<br /><br />Honestly I think being honest is your best bet, considering you are going to someone who is a professional &quot;listener&quot;. Just describe the difficulties you are having with focus, etc. When it comes to treating ADHD Adderall is infact a lot of times the first thing they try. Or they may suggest vivance which is very similar but longer acting.

So thats why I chose to go to a psychiatrist first... I&#039;ve also read that doctors like to try some antidepressants or other non-stimulant drugs before trying adderall. I just don&#039;t want to have to go through that whole process of trying 5 different prescriptions before adderall.

				Don&#039;t ask for Adderall. See the doctor / psychiatrist and tell them your story.<br />If you suggest to them that you&#039;ve tried Adderall before and you want more, they will think you&#039;re just a speed junkie or someone who likes using Amphetamine recreationally.<br />The chances of them giving you Adderall after you say you&#039;ve already tried it and now you are asking for more will seem like you enjoy Adderall and only want Adderall, not just to be able to concentrate better. Try whatever they suggest first. You can always get Adderall from Silk Road if you want it anyway.
