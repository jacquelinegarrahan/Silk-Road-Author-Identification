				So, here&#039;s a question.&nbsp; What do you prefer?&nbsp; Drugs that have been around for a long time (cocaine, marijuana, lsd, mdma, etc.), or research chemicals?&nbsp; If so, which ones have you tried and enjoyed?<br /><br />I&#039;ve only tried your basics.&nbsp; Weed, shrooms, lsd, mdma, cocaine, etc.&nbsp; I snorted 2C-I once and didn&#039;t get much out of it other than a burning sensation.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried Ketamine and MXE, and I definitely prefer Ketamine over MXE due to the sedative effect K gives.&nbsp; I tried DOC once, most horrible experience of my life.&nbsp; Looking to maybe experiment a little, and some feedback would be nice!

				I still haven&#039;t found anything I like more than weed or mdma. There are quite a few worthwhile RC&#039;s, but it seems best drugs are the famous ones, and RC&#039;s are for people who like to experiment more.

				Research Chemicals definitely offer something for the more adventurous drug users. They&#039;re a lot like the legendary drugs you know and love; rough around the edges sometimes, but with some slightly new features.

				MDMA and LSD were once &quot;research chemicals&quot;&nbsp; themselves and there are plenty of others out there that have a lot of potential. <br />The term &quot;research chemical&quot; is really only applied to drugs whose legal status is not yet determined or outlawed completely yet. There are a lot of psychoactive chemical that have been discovered but not popularised in the way MDMA and LSD have but they are out there.

So far the chemicals chosen as &#039;research chemicals&#039; for psychoactive purposes tend to be based on the structures of neurotransmitters and established safe known chemicals, only being slight variations, and having little chance of additional side effects. Most chemicals of each &#039;class&#039; that are widely used are fairly similar to one another within the same class.

				Well you can&#039;t say I like the &quot;original&quot; drugs or research chemicals more.<br />I like some illegal drugs and I like some research chemicals (which are btw not all legal, too :D)<br />Best RC I&#039;ve done was 2C-E - I had VERY strong optics, MUCH more intense than LSD, but LSD gives me a totally different feeling I just love... well, every drug is special, you can&#039;t say &quot;this one&#039;s better than this&quot;.

				The only research chemical I&#039;ve tried is MXE, which I fucking love.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a bunch of 2C-I for awhile, but haven&#039;t found the time to try it yet.<br />I think I&#039;d rather do shrooms, MDMA, K, and smoke real weed, though, over any RCs.<br />I am, however, interested in MDPV, Mephedrone, 4-FA, 4-ACO-DMT, 5-MEO-DIPT, and all of the 2C&#039;s.

				Well my top 3 drugs are cannabis, n2o and AMT.<br />Although n2o isn&#039;t a research chemical (at least to the best of my knowledge) they are both legal (in the UK) and easily in the top 3 with no contest.<br /><br />As far as RC go i have only done AMT and MXE. AMT is brilliant and better than MDMA imo, huge euphoria while still being in complete control and with no comedown, truly a shout for my true favorite drug im only surprised more people don&#039;t do it or haven&#039;t heard of it.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t like MXE but i can see why people do, my friend said it was very similar to his experiences of ket but he is no expert.<br /><br />So generally i think RC are often better than illegal drugs but that being said ive never found a legal replacement for cannabis, salvia was good but quite different and id still take cannabis over it.

				Most of the research chemicals haven&#039;t been good to me. Pyrovalenes and cathinones are extremely cardiotoxic (with one worthwhile exception being now scheduled mephedrone) at effective doses, I&#039;d say crack cocaine is probably safer than that. From phenethylamines, only mild 2C-D is something I&#039;d care to repeat, simply because speedier trips are too confusing as in fact all psychedelics are. Synthetic cannabinoids do a good job, but I havent tested them extensively, plus they have reputation for sending people to a hospital with panic attacks, and do raise my pulse up somewhat though it could have been for psychological rather than pharmacological reasons. Phenazepam OD almost cost me my job and scared the shit out of my family, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend that either.

But damn, am I the only one who always gets an erection like hell on that stuff? :D<br />Btw, did anybody try synthetic cannabiniods orally? I&#039;m really interested &#039;bout this, but I&#039;m just not sure what dosage I can take without a risk. I&#039;ve noticed my pulse raises up when I do JWH-122, too.

				I&#039;ve read on some forums about quite a few people using different JWH compounds orally.<br /><br />It&#039;s always stressed to be very careful and know the dosage of course though.<br /><br />I myself have never tried the oral route I just make my own spice with 210 or 018 broken down in everclear.

				Think I&#039;m gonna start like always, with a VERY low dosage which I&#039;ll slowly increase. Would be alot easier if I&#039;d got the pure JWH, or would at least know how much JWH comes on one mg of that incense...

				I know about the risks, I&#039;ve done pretty much psychedelics so I can handle horrortrips a little, but the healthy aspect... I thought about other poisonous ingredients in this incense, too... I know the psychoactive substance is JWH-122 for sure (lab test), but I don&#039;t know which parfumes and shit they&#039;ve token...<br />I wouldn&#039;t even have an incense if my buddy didn&#039;t give it away to me for free^^<br />But I&#039;m not THAT interested in synthetic cannabinoids that I&#039;d spend money on them. Think I&#039;m gonna smoke that incense and if I get the chance to test some pure stuff, I&#039;ll search for a good dosage to take it orally.

Even more if you do it orally. I had some experiences compareable to acid when doing some nice hash orally... But you can&#039;t denie synthetic cannabinoids are WAY more potent. Actually hundreds of times.<br />And it&#039;s definitely not &quot;people like me&quot; who got anything banned. Seriously, did you even read what I wrote? I said I won&#039;t do this premade-stuff orally because I don&#039;t know about poisonous parfumes or other shit they used. I said I&#039;d only do the pure stuff orally, and that I&#039;ll inform myself about the dosage first. I also said I&#039;ll start with a VERY low dosage (like always) and will slowly raise it. Hell, I even did a fucking lab test to know the exact psychoactive substance. And the increased pulse is just a normal side effect of this substance I worried about. I don&#039;t know how &quot;people like me&quot; cause a ban of a substance if they say they will be VERY cautious because they don&#039;t want to risk their health?

				My only experience of RCs was a mate buying some methadrone when it was legal. He projectile vomited during the night out out and described the experience as one of his drug taking valleys rather than a peak. He threw the rest of his gram away.<br /><br />Ultimately if society went the way of legalisation I think we would have to compromise on what drugs are avaliable. I think we would see an increased trade in natural drugs. For example nobody deals in khat here - I know it has to be sent out fresh before it breaks down but I bet few here have used khat.<br /><br />Other natural drugs include coca leaves. I&#039;d be happy to have a mild cocaine hit chewing these and drinking a tea which is strong enough to make everyone a little more chatty. <br /><br />As for research chemicals and hallucinagenics - why bother using some unknown when we have hundreds of substances out there - from frogs, to herbs and fungi and seeds. There is a world of &#039;good&#039; natural highs out there. Taking the more rare ones would be as cutting edge as testing the RCs out.<br /><br />If we said &#039;ok lets legalise all RCs&#039; - the Chinese would be all over the place creating every conceivable high. But if the chemicals were legal they would have to assume responsibility for those who use them - just like the big pharm boys.<br /><br />Drugs are meant to be enjoyed so ensuring safety has to the no 1 priority. I think we have enough drugs out there - but I agree that more will be found and ultimately people will have to take risks on any new product - including all the legal meds we have out there. <br /><br />The reason we have the trade in RCs is due to the difficulty of sourcing good drugs. Methadrone became popular as a substitute for MDMA - for some the drug was on that wavelength but for others it was very toxic. With MDMA the toxicity of the drug is well within an acceptable range. Give 100 people MDMA and most will like it if not all! However - MDMA is a very powerful drug - and you can abuse it for sure. <br /><br />My preference is tried and tested drugs. Above all cannabis is my all time fav and it can be used to do a myriad of good things - from getting you high to relaxing you when you have some illness. I have eaten a LOT of cannabis - and if you ingest enough of it then you will be on another planet almost. Fun thing is that you know you will not be dying in your sleep with cannabis - even if you &#039;overdose&#039; you will be ok the next day.<br /><br />Cannabis is the safest drug - but if you smoke it then smoking itself is not healthy. Its like anything in life - most people risk an early grave eating junk food and not exercising - I prefer a risk that at least has benefit to the individual.<br /><br />Speed - I can hold my hand up as I used it a lot. Ultimatly it ought to be &#039;special occasion&#039; drug. For anyone over the age of 30 speed tends to hit us harder than it used to. A &#039;good&#039; speed means I would be like a kitten for several days after. Cocaine, its maybe the best drug for people who work - use some Friday and Sat and the damage is way less than that of speed. MDMA hits me hard also. People who say there is no comedown, well, every drug that takes you high as E has to have a come down which is equal to the high. <br /><br />RCs are dangerous also. People buy a kilo of some RC and mix it with inert powders to create &#039;bath salts&#039;. I know MDPV was used in some - people were getting wasted by daily use of these things - especially younger people who are by nature more reckless with intake (don&#039;t listen to your mates - read up on ANY drug you may use)<br /><br />The synthetic cannabis mixes - my guess is they are carcinogenic due to the use of moldy old herbs - any old herb thrown in - (the dodgy spice mix made millions for the people who marketed it before it was made illegal)&nbsp; plus perfumes also. No way would this get a license to be sold ever. Synthetic cannabis even in the pure form is a poor poor substitute for real good honest weed or hash.<br /><br />Coca, hash, cannabis, hallucinogenic plants, animals and whatever - we have used these things for thousands of years and survived. I&#039;ll take what nature has to offer before I dabble in man - made chemicals. Give me khat or coca - not amphetamine!<br /><br />Mines a bud!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Thanks for reading.&nbsp; :)
