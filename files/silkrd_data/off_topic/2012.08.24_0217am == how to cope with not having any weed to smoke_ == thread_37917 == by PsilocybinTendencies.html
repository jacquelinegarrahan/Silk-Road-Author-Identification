				I know how you feel. I stopped smoking for a while and I wanted to punch shit just because I had so much energy. I suggest a 10 minute meditation session, work out, or whatever hobby you may have (video games, Netflix, etc). The main problem is that you&#039;re bored and you have a habit (I wouldn&#039;t call it an addiction). So replace it with another habit. If you really want to you could drink alcohol, or pop some diphenhydramine to get a little sleepy.<br /><br />Or I could smoke you out.&nbsp; 8)

I thinking smoking just helps me cope.<br /><br />But I do have a whole kindle to work my way through.<br /><br />In an attempt to take b0lix&#039;s advice to stay busy I just tinkered with playing a little bit of guitar. I&#039;m amazed at how shitty I got by not practicing for a few months. Was toying with an easy song -- sons and daughters by the decemberists (I&#039;ve been on a decemberists kick lately).<br /><br />Got to playing it to where it sounded pretty good, but I&#039;ve never been able to sing and play simultaneously &lt;_&lt; try as hard as I might.

				If you really wanna get high, I would go to a smoke shop and buy some nasty ass spice. That&#039;s how I got into drugs. I was bored after work one day and decided I should get high.<br /><br />I smoked way too much and had an out of body experience though... which led to psychedelics.

				I can usually hold off for awhile if for some reason I&#039;m out of weed but if I&#039;m out of weed I either buy more from a local dealer (I don&#039;t like doing this at all),just work over time and/or keep myself busy with my girl,or get high by other means.Ive been know to crack a few cans of nitrous to hold me over when I&#039;m out of weed haha even pop some DXM pills or chug some syrup just to relax and get high to make the wait suck a little less.I try not to over do it though.I only do it one day to keep me from going nuts and it usually helps and keeps me from being so pissy until I get weed.I&#039;m in the same situation I have a grow going but its not ready yet.I think I should have ordered when I was down to an 8th and used a little more self control because I ended up blowing all but 2 bowls of that 8th in one session&nbsp; :-\

				I was like OP back in my younger days. Just don&#039;t smoke so much weed, and take up a few hobbies. It will keep situations like this from arising, and when you do smoke it will be so much better.

				I would recommend Meditating, to cope with the feeling/shit you normally use weed to deal with. You can also meditate while smoking weed, which is nothing short of pure bliss.<br /><br />I was becoming an intolerable asshole every time I had to go without, to the point it bothered me.<br /><br />Also see it as a tolerance break (holy shit, you will GET HIGH after a break), and a chance to do some other shit/tasks you normally wouldn&#039;t touch.<br /><br />These breaks between mailings can be useful. Now I have like 10 variety&#039;s of weed, so it won&#039;t be my problem for a while.. <br /><br />SR=Heaven for me&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />My god, if I knew things would be this good I would have gone easy on all those shitty cheap ass street drugs I sucked up for years.

Marijuana helps keep my head straight and addresses back and joint pains. What i have discovered is that 5-htp helps me through times of no weed. Everyone&#039;s chemistry is different but 5-htp helps me with the cravings, agitation, and bitchiness that having no weed does to me. My back is hurting like hell, but oh well. i will have some dank nugs by the end of next week. So to the OP, do a little research on 5-htp and give it a try if so inclined. And you are correct that physical withdrawals from other drugs can be very nasty. The worst for me was benzo withdrawals, damn, lasted for literally 3 months, fuck xanax,valium,etc. imo opiate withdrawal was much easier than stopping the benzos. Now i just smoke pot, mdma every month or two, and the occasional DMT experience (very seldom, maybe 4 times a year) or shroom trip.

				Muzzacc and the news or whatever occupies my mind. I am not hooked on anything in particular. I just like to party and get high but it&#039;s not the only thing in life. I am in complete control of my mind. Even pain don&#039;t hurt me. I can smoke crack and shoot meth for two months straight and never even think about it for years later. The mind is amazing. The one true gift we have is the ability to control our thoughts which in turn controls how we feel. I get high off music or a good dramatic movie or comedy, action, sci-fi, a flurry of arts. Man I don&#039;t need drugs I just enjoy them when I can afford them after the bills and child support are paid.

I moved out when i was 17 and from that day forward till now i have smoked about a 3.5 daily, (with a few exceptions of course... some jail time being most of the exceptions) <br /><br />as for running out... forget it.. I too get totally cranky, irritable, and snappy.. its a real ugly site...<br /><br />I always make sure I have my medicine.... without a doubt 100%. there is no running out with me. i do what I gotta do to get &quot;high&quot;<br /><br />anyways.. if money is tight just try fronting like a 3.5 from ur local dealer.. lets say he charges you 35..<br /><br />&nbsp;make 5...... 0.7 sacs,,,,, sell 4 of them&nbsp; for 10 bucks each... make 5 bucks and even have a few pinners for yourself to smoke... <br /><br />hope this helps you out buddy.

				I&#039;ve managed to work something out to get replacement weed ordered until this current transaction gets resolved. Shouldn&#039;t be long now!<br /><br />Thanks for all the input on the matter guys!<br /><br />Someday maybe I&#039;ll move to Cali and have badass weed hookups irl like you guys do too!<br /><br />I have managed to smoke a couple times since this was posted.

				People probably wont agree with me but heres my 2 cents. I dont think that weed should be a necessity. I use it to even me out after a hard day at school on vyvanse. If its medical they should smoke all they want but I personally have felt like weed has been taking over my life, I smoke so much I get couch lock. The only half productive thing I do high isplay guitar.<br /><br />Dont bash on me though if smoking all the time works for your situation, enjoy it.

				Well as for me, I have taken long breaks from smoking before. Mostly just because. Usually a few months, half a year or more before I start again (but I always start again ;p ).<br /><br />It sucks a lot at first because you have a habit/routine that needs to be replaced. Fortunately, I tinker with a lot of things to keep me busy, so that helps fill the void / replace the routine quite a lot. But still, I get grouchy and irritable. The sleepless nights are the worst because they just add to the irritability and the need to fix that by getting stoned again.<br /><br />But once that initial couple of weeks have passed, I usually do okay. By the time a month has gone by, I don&#039;t miss it.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t taken more than three weeks off in the last year, and that wasn&#039;t by choice. I can&#039;t find shit in this town, or when I can, it is shit. I just found SR. I haven&#039;t had the ability to place any orders yet for bud, but I&#039;m okay on that for the moment.

				I&#039;m a little concerned by this as I gave him a small loan(only 1.5 btc).&nbsp; I&#039;m not rich though so every coin helps.&nbsp; I wonder if he is still on sr under his username pipedreamz?&nbsp; He didn&#039;t have to pay me back until the 17th of this month though so I&#039;ll post back here to update people I guess.&nbsp; Anyone know if he posted an explanation of any kind?<br /><br />In the end necessity makes dogs of us all I suppose, so although I don&#039;t condone his actions if he did leave, I definitely understand them.

				Movies, tv shows and videogames for me usually<br /><br />I&#039;m in the same situation, ran out yesterday &amp; my usual vendor appears to have gone quiet for a change (unusual for him, usually he has it packed up and sent within a few hours of putting the order through :(<br /><br />I have awful stomach pains which were caused by medication for something else, smoking weed makes it easier to handle.<br /><br />Plus i have a very stressful life right now, there is nothing I enjoy more then to come home and spark up &amp; relax<br /><br />None of my friends smoke unfortunately &amp; only local dealer i know only has shitty weed (i&#039;d rather wait and be moody/irritable for a day or two then waste money on crap)<br />
