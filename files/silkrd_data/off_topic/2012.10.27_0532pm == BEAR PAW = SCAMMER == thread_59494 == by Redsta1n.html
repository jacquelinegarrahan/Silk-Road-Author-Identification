				Please everyone beware that Bear Paw is a scammer! Just stole $155 from me claiming to sell bitcoins. Also this user has multiple accounts one including the name &quot;those coins&quot; that he uses to boost his reputation. If you would like proof please pm me and I will send you snap shots of our discussion. CLAIMS TO BE A DEA AGENT!

				Hey all so I am purchasing myself a vendor account (hopefully today) to sell my hacked paypal accounts with $1k-$2k pre-loaded on them. As a new vendor I will be selling samples extremely cheap until I prove myself then I will slowly start raising the price. You will be making more then $700 profit on each one. Not trying to sell them here but just wondering how many people would be interested in this sort of thing on SR. I have already been selling them for a little while offline until my discovery of SR and realizing this is the perfect place to offer this. <br /><br />redsta1ns first post.<br /><br />hes a nigger and deserved it, portion of the funds will go to dpr <br />and his mods.

I have a reputation to build here and I am not going to scam anyone after I just paid $150 (or rather some $400 after fees and money stolen) for a vendor account.

I have not scammed anyone nor do i plan to. I aim to treat them as family and if I do so I will be rewarded. If I scam the people here it isnt even worth it. It may be a quick dollar but I will lose in the long run. Some people do not like what I do but I dont like what 99% of the people do on here as well. I know many people who have died from these drugs that are sold in this market, when was the last time you heard of someone dying because their paypal was hacked? Im not going to try to stop these people or criticize them because they choose to live their lives that way but its just not what i would do because personally that is past my moral standards, whereas denting someones wallet temporarily is not. I take your scamming as a learning lesson for me but I am unphased by it. If my paypal were hacked I would treat it the same way. Just be more cautious in the future.<br /><br />P.S. Hacking is not scamming. I did not lead someone on to trust me and break that trust.

However, &quot;redsta1n&quot; apparently is involved in hacking paypal accounts, and attempting to sell them, which of course is prohibited here. Otherwise, I&#039;m just watching and enjoying the comedy.

				If your motivations are pure and you are doing a &#039;robin hood&#039; routine and giving the money to some bullshit church, what was your motivation for robbing me of 1 coin?&nbsp; It&#039;s like I told you in our messages, I knew I was losing the coin before I even transferred it, but what do I care about 1 coin?&nbsp; It was worth 1 coin to me to see how you would react to me knowing the truth ... whether or not you would take the extra coin or stick to your lie. <br /><br />Basically what happened was bp messaged me saying something about 75mcg Fentanyl patches for 2btc each and he had 4 of them.&nbsp; Well, I knew this was too good to be true.&nbsp; I even told the guy I only wanted 1 patch not all 4 at such a good price, he could make more money yadda yadda.&nbsp; Anyway, I can go back and pull the messages.&nbsp; I asked bear if he knew PGP and he said he did so I could send him my address before I sent the coin.&nbsp; I sent him a pgp message that said &#039;you are lying&#039; and that was all it said.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I transfer the coin and watch the lie unfold.&nbsp; The day before it is supposed to be here, I send him a message saying &#039;I tried to order some other items from other vendors, and I had compatibility issues with my PGP program, can you please verify part of my address so I make sure you got it right&quot; and he responds &quot;I don&#039;t remember any of it&quot; or something to that effect.&nbsp; So, I tell him, &quot;Look if something happened where you weren&#039;t able to send out my package, that is fine, just be honest with me and I&#039;ll even give you another coin for being truthful&quot;.&nbsp; To which he replies &quot;I sent it Ok? Im not lying to you&quot;.&nbsp; So I say something like &#039;Okay, sorry to sound skeptical&#039;.&nbsp; The next day he says &quot;Yor package was in my mailbox. I didnt put enough fucking stamps on it. Fuck. Im sorry PLEASE RESPONFD ASAP&quot;.&nbsp; So, at that time I tell him the punch line, which is I never sent my address.<br /><br />I mostly feel sorry for someone that has to do so much leg work and bullshit for 1 coin.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s pretty clear you are a thief that doesn&#039;t have the motivation/inclination to do an honest days work.&nbsp;

				Maybe im going out on a limb here but for the life of me I just dont understand how people can put so much trust into people that they dont even know. I wonder if people realize that were still in an anonymous world behind computer screens. Dont know much about these two, even though I think both are wrong in my OPINION, but alot of you are acting like whoever you pray to turned their back on you.
