				If you only have the card number expiry date ccv from the back of card and cardholder full name than there is not that much you can do<br />Here is a few<br />1 Porn<br />Everyone likes porn at some ponit in age. Why not get your own online porn store???, or rather 10 of them?To get it going you will have to invest about 50-100 buks for domain and actual site, around 5-80 buks to run traffic to it or do it yourself if you can 8)Then you can start putting thru registration your CCs.THe only shit thing about it that pornt content provider gets a cut up to75 percent so mehhhh<br />2 Online shopping<br />Pays Bit Better then stupid porn.Actually quite complicated strategy thats involved at least two groups of individuals where one is a drop, reciving goods from online stores and actions that were purtchest by a second individual you with CCs. After orders reach dropper he gets a dosh or cut a ships you goods)<br />3 Telemarketing and communication<br />Risky but sooo good<br />For this con job you need to be smart and cannot fuck up. Step one* Open a business under a fake person that provides mobile entertainment such as ringtones,wallpapers and crap like that or anything like a sicologist phone line or whatever makes your phone charge per minute or sms sergeant rate ;)<br />Step two** Our businessmen or paid number is running, we buy a whole box of dollar sims, shuv em in imei free or shit nokia phone(with mxkey) recharge sim and use ur line 8)Dont forget to advurtise it and keep at least 2 months gap between the steps to stay heat free)<br />Many other less popular way out there that i cant be bothered going thru, think of it what is card made for and than use it 8)<br /><br />Now if you got nombers thas inside the card Track2 or all 3tracks or even beatter Track 2 with pin, than there is nothing better than getting urself few partners and run em to shops for some digital equipment or atms for withrowals&nbsp; ;D Afcores wll you numbers gotta b burned on to plastic and dressed up like real card)<br /><br />Anyway limitless is on holiday or someshit, and SR is not a place for that kind of buisenes<br />&nbsp;
