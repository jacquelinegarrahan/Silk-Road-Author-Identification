				Well, without doing proper and thorough research into this, here is my answers based on my knowledge so far.<br />I&#039;ve had to give 2 or more countries to some of the answers because they are both good in different ways.<br /><br />Which country has the most relaxed drug laws? Netherlands due to it&#039;s harm reduction strategies. Portugal for decriminalising possession of drugs.<br /><br />Which country has greatest freedom of speech? Switzerland. The US has too much power &amp; control IMO<br /><br />Which country has the most liberal laws regarding internet monitoring / filtering? Most of Europe, Canada, Japan, many more countries. I&#039;d like to say USA but they have plans to filter the internet so I will leave the US out of my list. Internet freedom is very important and it is vital that the Governments across the world don&#039;t try and restrict it. Adults should have access to anything they wish on the internet - Not what the Government lets them. The Australian Government wants a filter on their internet which will block anything it thinks is unsuitable for general public. I think this is a disgrace.<br /><br />Which country has the greatest freedom of media control? Scaninavian countries &amp; Japan<br /><br />Which country has the least corruption? Scandinavian countries &amp; Canada<br /><br />Which country gives the most freedom in terms of a person doing what he pleases? I&#039;d have to say a lot of counties in Asia &amp; South America. They may have higher levels of corruption, but they are generally free to do that they want and their laws are quite relaxed compared to western countries.<br /><br />Which country has the most freedom in regards to minors? I really have no idea. I&#039;ve never thought of this and it&#039;s hard to decide.<br /><br />Which country has the most relaxed security? Parts of Asia &amp; South America

				Which country has the most relaxed drug laws?<br /><br />The conservative Dutch (national) government has been cracking down in some areas as of late. So I couldn&#039;t really say the Netherlands.<br /><br />If I am correct In Canada, in British Columbia, a legal posture has been assumed that almost all drugs are legal to possess but not to sell (using heroin in public is not technically illegal but can be considered disorderly)<br /><br />Which country has greatest freedom of speech?<br /><br />I would also say Switzerland.<br /><br /><br />Which country has the most liberal laws regarding internet monitoring / filtering?<br /><br />I would say the Netherlands. As far as I know they really are the most &quot;free&quot; place in this regard.<br /><br />Which country has the greatest freedom of media control?<br /><br />According to several studies put out there seems to be the most freedom in Finland and Norway.<br /><br />Which country has the least corruption?<br /><br />Denmark, Finland, and New Zealand, all tie for the least corruption according to the organization transparency international<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2012/12/Screen-shot-2012-12-05-at-12.17.00-PM.png<br /><br />Which country gives the most freedom in terms of a person doing what he pleases?<br /><br />The most war torn country&#039;s really. Because of the chaos people are free to do what they please in the midst of things.<br /><br />Which country has the most freedom in regards to minors?<br /><br />I might be totally off base with this, but I believe Mexico. I don&#039;t know if you would call this &quot;freedom&quot; as a person of age 12 is basically equivalent to the age of 18 being called &quot;adult&quot; in the United States. <br /><br />Which country has the most relaxed security?<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know the answer to this one, but I remember many years back flying into Australia. I had somehow managed to take a rather large knife with me in my carry on without even noticing. It&#039;s amazing I didn&#039;t get stopped and arrested here in America. I got stopped by security in AUS and when the guy found the knife he said to me and I quote, &quot;man, make sure not to do this again, you might freak someone out,&quot; and gave it back to me.<br />I doubt it is still like that, but oh memory&#039;s.<br /><br />Chaos

If not then your nipples face in very different directions. <br />By making yourself out to be a horny woman you hope people will donate money to your bitcoin address. <br /><br />If you read through all of your posts none of them have done anything positive. Every one of your posts that have not been spam have either had nothing to do with the thread you were posting in, or had nothing to do with what had been said in the thread.

				What&#039;s with all the negativity in here? Can we all not argue and have an adult conversation. I agree that USA does have alot of religious freedom, but there are still alot of hate crimes here, aswell. It&#039;s not perfect. All of North America, all of South America(for the most part), almost all European countries have it so you can believe whatever religion you want to believe without persecution. The USA is a very good country don&#039;t get me wrong. But the way they are going it won&#039;t be long before there are Predator drones armed with hellfire missles and thermal imaging flying around above everyone&#039;s house.

Our Prime Minister is an absolute idiot. She made several important promises before the last election and the election was a tie between the two major parties here, so she gave a few independent politicians exactly what they wanted if&nbsp; they sided with her, so she could obtain power. To do this, she broke the biggest election promises. She created a carbon tax which just made everything even more expensive (If you&#039;ve visited Australia in t he last 3 years you would be outraged at how expensive it has become) and she has created several budged deficits when she promised to bring the budget back to surplus again. she is arrogant and out of touch with society. She is an atheist yet she is still against gay marriage (why do people have a problem with gay marriage? - It doesn&#039;t affect anybody in a negative way. It just gives gay people the right to marry, which I think is good. If it harms nobody and makes people happy, why not legalise it?). She also plans to filter the internet and force ISP&#039;s to keep all data stored for 2 years, but that proposal has been put on hold for now. She also spent billions of dollars on funding schools which was audited and could have been done for 1/3 of the price - Another example of reckless government spending.<br /><br />Banning tobacco is on the long term agenda. The tax of alcohol is set to increase massively to &quot;stop binge drinking.&quot; Warning labels cover 100% of tobacco packets already and alcohol will have to have health warnings soon too. Some politicians also favour banning alcohol completely. Apparently, &quot;It is a great cost to society and the country would benefit economically from it.&quot;<br /><br />You see - This makes no sense. Why should tobacco and alcohol become illegal? I don&#039;t consume tobacco but it should still be a personal choice whether to smoke or not. Same with alcohol. What is the point of banning something simply because it would help the economy? I do not live my life to help t he economy. I live my life to contribute to society and by doing things I enjoy. Alcohol is something I enjoy (not as much as drugs though&nbsp; :) )<br /><br />Also in Australia you get a $200 fine for consuming alcohol in a public place. Undercover police sometimes patrol beaches and parks and fine people who are having picnic lunches with a beer on a Sunday. Yes, I&#039;m serious - They do this. If you&#039;re in a nightclub district they often do sniff checks of any bottles you are carrying don&#039;t contain alcohol.<br />Sniffer dogs are at train stations, nightclubs and just roaming city streets daily, catching people with small amounts of drugs.<br /><br />Speed cameras in some states can get you an send a fine in the mail if you are going just 4km/h over the ridiculously slow speed limits. Other states it&#039;s 6km/h or even up to 10km/h lenience.<br /><br />Sorry about the rant and excessive use of examples but I just think the way Australia is going, it will be an extremely boring place to live.<br />I believe that if an adult wishes to do something at their own free will without harming anybody else, then they should be able to do it without worrying about getting caught. <br />We live life once, why the fuck should we be forced by the Governments rules to waste it being protected and safe? I should be able to live my life how I want.

Also earlier in the day mscat was arguing in another thread with someone about nothing. If you click her name and read her posts I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll see that as well.

Sooner or later the United States will have the predator drones searching not only the United States for readings of drugs, but the whole world. There is no where to hide from all of the worlds governments. Maybe I should just move to the rainforest build a house, live there in peace off the land. Before I go ill spend all of my money, as I won&#039;t need it anymore, on a supply of drugs to last my whole life.

It&#039;s just so sad to see how the world is heading. I don&#039;t even want to think about what it will be like in 20 years time. Surveillance drones will be flying around making sure no one is being naughty. The 90&#039;s were the best years. People were nicer and you could have fun without worrying about being caught or fined for something that doesn&#039;t even harm anyone. Police used to be nicer and were friendly and would often let people away with a warning. Nowadays there is no such thing as friendly police.<br /><br />I do intend on moving overseas in the future. I have commitments here now, but it&#039;s definitely on my plan. Not sure of here to go yet, but somewhere in Europe or Asia most likely. I&#039;ve never been to South America, so I think I have to check out a few countries there first too before I decide. I want to live somewhere with relaxed laws that let people take responsibility for themselves. Even t he third world countries I&#039;ve visited are nicer places to live than here. They may not have much money, but at least they are happy and don&#039;t have to worry about things people in the US or Australia have to worry about.<br /><br />Hmmm a lifetime of supply of drugs sounds good too!

				Cops in Australia are allowed to pull a vehicle over and strip it completely bare if the officer on scene deems it necessary. They call it, &quot;Officers discretion&quot; - this basically allows Aus Pigs to get away with whatever they want. The laws governing it were brought in after the trade tower thing.<br /><br />Look no further than Aussie Cops for corruption and malpractice.<br /><br />New South Wales and Tasmanian Police Farces in particular get a special nod from the underworld and overworld heavyweights ;) ;) Aint that right Damian Bugg??

I think in the past that Australia has been on the rise economically due to external factors, but once the down cycle appears proper (as China&#039;s growth slows probably), as it does with all capitalist economies, then I think Australia is going to turn into a truly miserable place to be, I&#039;m sure there will be riots on the streets, it&#039;ll be worse even in comparison to all the bullshit you&#039;re looking at now. It&#039;d be nice if there was a way for there to be a direct feedback between redundant government policies and the people who make them. It&#039;s like politicians are the only people in the world who are expected to be useless at their jobs. We need a more scientific approach to getting rid of them, and I&#039;m not talking about central planning or technocracy. Democracy has its advantages, but there has to be a way to get shot of these cadres of idiots without crude interventions every couple of years.<br /><br />P.S. Fun fact for our resident conspiracy theorists: Pine was renamed (from a strain of weed) after my favorite ECHELON installation in Australia.

She gave them whatever they wanted if they agreed to support the Labour Party. A huge majority of the population is very close-minded and dim and accept anything the Government tells them. <br />Since speed cameras were introduced in Australia roughly 20-25 years ago, the motto has been &quot;every K over is a killer.&quot; It is pretty much the only road rule that is actually enforced, along with drink-driving. Every other law is more difficult to enforce and doesn&#039;t create as much revenue as speed cameras. The majority of people these days actually believe they are safe drivers if they do not speed, yet they put make up on in the car, drive in whichever lane they want to, even when they aren&#039;t overtaking, etc. Just the whole attitude of people here is awful.<br /><br />Also reckless Government spending infuriates me. They create Government jobs which are funded by more debt, and then gloat about low unemployment levels. A while back, one public servant went to he media and said they had been paid $90,000 per year for several years and hadn&#039;t actually turned up to work in over a year.<br /><br />Also the minimum wage is now roughly $20 / hour which is too high. it makes everything here very expensive and has killed the international employment industry which is why unemployment has risen recently and tourism spots in Queensland such as the Gold Coast and tropical Queensland have high unemployment rates and occupancy for hotels and resorts is low.<br /><br />Th worst part is that it is getting worse constantly. SO many new laws are being introduced which diminish freedom. The Government wished to spy on everything people do and their attitude is &quot;if you&#039;re not doing anything illegal, you have nothing to worry about.&quot; For one, drugs should be legal or at least decriminalised and a lot of these laws are targeting drug use and distribution. But that isn&#039;t the point. People shouldn&#039;t have their privacy invaded by the Government. I think as time passes I will end up moving overseas. Not sure where yet, but there are much nicer and more relaxed places to live. The Australian Government is destroying Australia and this is made clear because there is a high number of Australian citizens moving to the UK or elsewhere.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />I know and I agree with all of that. I think in the past that Australia has been on the rise economically due to external factors, but once the down cycle appears proper (as China&#039;s growth slows probably), as it does with all capitalist economies, then I think Australia is going to turn into a truly miserable place to be, I&#039;m sure there will be riots on the streets, it&#039;ll be worse even in comparison to all the bullshit you&#039;re looking at now. It&#039;d be nice if there was a way for there to be a direct feedback between redundant government policies and the people who make them. It&#039;s like politicians are the only people in the world who are expected to be useless at their jobs. We need a more scientific approach to getting rid of them, and I&#039;m not talking about central planning or technocracy. Democracy has its advantages, but there has to be a way to get shot of these cadres of idiots without crude interventions every couple of years.<br /><br />P.S. Fun fact for our resident conspiracy theorists: Pine was renamed (from a strain of weed) after my favorite ECHELON installation in Australia.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Australia is very lucky that we have lots of natural resources and that is why the economy has grown well in the past, but this won&#039;t last forever and it is already slowing. Once it starts to slow a bit more and the Government debt gets even higher, the country will be fucked - it will be like Detroit. I agree that there will be riots, etc. However I think this will happen in a lot of countries. I&#039;m not saying it will be World War 3, but in my opinion there will be a lot of political disruption in a lot of countries around the world in 5 - 20 years time.<br />Also, +1.<br />I wish I could meet some of the people on here in real-life. Think how well we&#039;d get along! Pine, chaosforpeace and many, many more who I can&#039;t remember the usernames to right now.<br />It would be good if the majority of the population who are clueless and dim can stay where they are and continue being &quot;protected&quot; by the Government.<br />And those of us who do not wish to be protected can go and start our own country which will given us supreme freedom and rights. A country that has no leader. Instead every citizen would have equal leadership. That country would thrive and the people living there would be happy. Think about how many things there are to worry about these days. There are so many things that people spend their lives worrying and stressing about. How they will afford to pay off their mortgage because the average house price in Australia is nearly $500,000. Worrying if they were speeding past that speed camera on the way home from their 12 hour day at work. Worrying about getting caught walking home with 1/4 of weed or a gram of speed. Everything that we worry about diminishes our happiness and that is why so many people have anxiety and depression. And the way they fix these problems is with prescription pills which have side effects. so they get more prescription pills, etc. I know someone who has depression and anxiety and they were prescribed xanax. That made them lethargic, hungry and put on weight, which made them even more depressed. So they were given phentermine (a type of amphetamine used for weight-loss). That made them not able to sleep at night, so their xanax dose was made higher. After several months they had to stop the phentermine because they can only prescribe it for a certain amount of time. Then they put on more weight and got more depressed and were put on a second type of anti-depressant. It only got worse - Prescription pills are given out like candy. Pills do not fix problems. They temporarily relieve the problem, but they do not fix it.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant... My point is that people have too much to worry about these days. Governments only make more things for people to worry about and less things for people to enjoy. When will it stop? When will people stop and think to themselves about how dire their life is. The majority of people spend their weekends at home, inside watching TV. It is safe, but personally I would rather go and do something new and exciting. Not watch race cars go around a track for 10 hours. How does watching TV all weekend refresh your mind and make you feel good? I just don&#039;t get it...<br />Life in the 1800&#039;s would have been a lot tougher but at least people didn&#039;t have the worries and stress that they have now. <br />In a little while when I have a bit of time, I will make a post here and have a proper argument about the future of politics... If anyone is interested?

				Which country has the most relaxed drug laws? <br />Holland, Portugal.<br /><br />Which country has greatest freedom of speech?<br />Not one single US newspaper dared reprint the &quot;Muhammed cartoon drawings&quot; From a Danish newspaper, some years ago. A few newspapers in other EU countries reprinted them though, to show support for the freedom of speech. So I would say, most western European countries.<br /><br />Which country has the most liberal laws regarding internet monitoring / filtering?<br />I&#039;m not sure at all. But maybe Brazil?<br /><br />Which country has the greatest freedom of media control?<br />I would say western Europe again. Might very well be other countries out there with just as much freedom of media control. I just can&#039;t think of any ATM.<br /><br />Which country has the least corruption?<br />Scandinavia: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland<br /><br />Which country gives the most freedom in terms of a person doing what he pleases?<br />Depends on how you look at it. I&#039;m pretty sure I can do whatever I please, more or less. In various countries in Africa, as long as I payed a few $ to the local police. Which is being seen more like a tax by the locals, than a bribe. <br /><br />Which country has the most freedom in regards to minors? <br />Maybe Spain. <br /><br />Which country has the most relaxed security?<br />Jamaica :D

				Which country has the most relaxed drug laws? <br /><br />Definitely Czech Republic. Personal use of all drugs is completely legal. Canada still has laws against personal use of everything, even weed I think. Holland has essentially legalized marijuana and is relaxed on soft drugs in general, but hard drugs are still illegal. Portugal has decriminalized personal use of all drugs, but they still confiscate them and can sentence people to drug treatment if they consider them addicts. Czech Republic is the only country I am aware of where personal use amounts or any drugs cannot even be confiscated by the police. <br /><br />Which country has greatest freedom of speech?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />USA has significant freedom of speech laws. I don&#039;t know how far freedom of speech extends in the Czech Republic, but they have legalized possession of child pornography and that to me is a big sign that they respect freedom of speech, in this specific instance they have much more freedom of speech than the USA does. <br /><br />Which country has the most liberal laws regarding internet monitoring / filtering?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The USA is one of the only countries in the world that does not mandate ISPs to engage in any data retention. Germany is another country that has refused to engage in mandatory data retention for ISPs, and I believe they have even ordered ISPs to stop engaging in data retention practices in the past. However the USA signals intelligence agency engages in a massive amount of spying on internet traffic. Pretty much all developed countries will have signals intelligence agencies that engage in this sort of surveillance though. There is also very little to no filtering of the Internet mandated in the USA, at least not in the same way as China or Australia. However, the USA has engaged in censorship of specific websites, such as gambling websites, where they seize their domain names. I have heard that Iceland is one of the most free countries in regards to lack of Internet censorship, and I believe they have strict laws protecting internet freedom. Czech Republic doesn&#039;t prevent people from accessing CP sites so that is in their favor. <br /><br />Which country has the greatest freedom of media control?&nbsp; <br /><br />Theoretically, the USA has a lot of freedom for the media. Pretty much the only thing they are prevented from doing is publishing child pornography. <br /><br />Which country has the least corruption?&nbsp; <br /><br />No idea, Sweden definitely comes to mind though. <br /><br />Which country gives the most freedom in terms of a person doing what he pleases?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Definitely Czech Republic. Prostitution is legal, the age of consent is pretty low, possession of CP is legal, possession of personal use amounts of all drugs is essentially legal. <br /><br />Which country has the most freedom in regards to minors?&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure<br /><br />Which country has the most relaxed security?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />No idea <br />

I&#039;d have to agree with alot of the points you made. Generally when walking around during the day police don&#039;t really do much other than walk around. However if you go into the nightclub districts at night time it is a different story. People get randomly searched and they sniff your water bottle to make sure it doesn&#039;t have alcohol in it. if it does, they fine you. Such a pathetic law - fining for drinking in public.<br /><br />Also if you are driving a car and get pulled over you will be treated like shit usually. You are assumed to be drunk, on drugs or a hoon without any proper reason and they receive a lecture on safe driving, etc. Most of the money put towards police is put towards traffic cops these days, because it raises a fortune in revenue for the government.

It&#039;s a fantastic substance. Without it, the world would be a much less civilized place, especially in times of war. But there is huge potential for painkiller addiction in general.<br /><br />The central problem is that people don&#039;t want to take responsibility for their actions. Like learning encryption, many people want to outsource their problems to others. Now, normally this is a good idea. That&#039;s why I don&#039;t try and make a homemade car in the garage, other people can do it better than me. But. There are certain things that simply cannot be outsourced to others, you have to investigate the area yourself or you&#039;ll fuck it up or get fucked up by somebody else. Money, drugs and encryption are good examples of such things.<br /><br />I think a practical libertarian realizes this, and stays somewhere between Richardo&#039;s Law of Comparative Advantage and his or her instincts about the appropriate level of self sufficiency.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150967.msg1048479#msg1048479">Quote from: Dingo Ate My Drugs on April 24, 2013, 11:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry for the rant... My point is that people have too much to worry about these days. Governments only make more things for people to worry about and less things for people to enjoy. When will it stop? When will people stop and think to themselves about how dire their life is. The majority of people spend their weekends at home, inside watching TV. It is safe, but personally I would rather go and do something new and exciting. Not watch race cars go around a track for 10 hours. How does watching TV all weekend refresh your mind and make you feel good? I just don&#039;t get it...<br />Life in the 1800&#039;s would have been a lot tougher but at least people didn&#039;t have the worries and stress that they have now. <br />In a little while when I have a bit of time, I will make a post here and have a proper argument about the future of politics... If anyone is interested?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, that&#039;s the thing with governments vs corporations. If the people get enough product, they slow down on their consumption of that product. If people pay for governance from our modern governments, our governments invent more things to govern. It&#039;s a fundamentally perverse arrangement, many people other than libertarians think so too.<br /><br />And if you want to make an argument, well, that&#039;s why the Philosophy subforum exists :)

				Yes, impossible. But it would be great. Haha.<br /><br />The house prices here did drop for a couple of years, but not much of a drop like in the US or Europe. Prices went down about 10 - 25%, and have since risen again.<br /><br />I agree. Some people can never take responsibility, which is quite sad I think. it is always someone else&#039;s fault.<br />Nowadays, people are so stupid they blame the Government for things they did which was their own stupidity which caused them harm.<br />Example: &quot;There was nothing to stop me from walking on the train tracks, so I walked on them and got hit by a train and now I have no legs. The Government is responsible for allowing me access to the train tracks.&quot; This has happened. And the other big one I hate is when obese people whinge and blame McDonalds because they are so fat they can no longer move. And same with smokers blaming tobacco companies.

				I am posting this in a few threads that I see chaosforpeace posted in.<br /><br />I am a friend of Choasforpeace and am trying to raise money for him.<br />Please donate to help chaosforpeace pay for a lawyer. The police confiscated all of his cash as evidence, he cannot even pay bail. He is stuck in holding until his court date. Any amount helps. I will be checking his accounts regularly.<br />Every penny counts,<br />Thanks
