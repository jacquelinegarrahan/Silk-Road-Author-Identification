				Hi guys,<br /><br />My first post here at Silk Road! I&#039;ve been lurking on the site and forums for a while but I&#039;ve only just decided to register an account to join in!<br /><br />I wanted to ask about cocaine. I don&#039;t do a massive amount of drugs, I used to have some joints with friends every other weekend and every few months I took magic truffles. I also recently started taking MDMA, only a few times but it was a really good time! Also some m-kat, but I didn&#039;t really get a big kick out of that. Finally some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, which the less said about those the better...<br /><br />But cocaine! A few friends of mine do it, one is a fairly all-together guy but the other is off-his-balls insane. I&#039;ve been offered it a few times and never really had any interest in it, I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s really addictive and modern cocaine isn&#039;t always very good. I&#039;m not interested in taking it every other weekend, just if there&#039;s someone going around with it at a party or club. Is it worth it? I&#039;m a big fan of MDMA, M-kat&#039;s okay, is it better to stick to those and not risk addiction or to do a line or two of cocaine instead?<br /><br />Any thoughts you guys have would be amazing! :)

				Cocaine is a hell of a drug.&nbsp; It&#039;s ruined probably thousands of lives.&nbsp; Your definitely taking your chances.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been battling cocaine addiction for over a decade.&nbsp; It&#039;s all up to you man.&nbsp; Do you have an addictive personality?&nbsp; You may think you don&#039;t and you find out you actually do.&nbsp; You roll the dice.&nbsp; But hell, you could die tomorrow so....

				Thanks.... I think.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In case I was misunderstood I was not advocating the use of cocaine.&nbsp; Believe me, it has a very good chance at ruining your life.&nbsp; In the end, the decisions is up to the individual.

				If it&#039;s nice and pure then go for it, don&#039;t waste you&#039;re time snorting 10% pure shit that goes around the streets. As far as addiction goes, yes it&#039;s very addictive but i wouldn&#039;t worry if you just do it once or twice or if someone is offering you it. I&#039;ve done it plenty of times and don&#039;t really care much for it. All depends on who you are i guess.<br />Peace n rice&nbsp; :)

				When i first came here, I gotta say, I was definitely a little interested in getting a gram of some awesome coke on SR...<br />I&#039;ve tried coke a few times, mostly shitty stuff, one time it was peruvian flake. <br /><br />Once i start thinking about ordering a little bit of coke i see some afghan heroin for sale, and although iv never done it, everytime i see it i remind myself thats the LAST thing i need to order.<br /><br />I have quite an addictive personality, and I do enough drugs as it is. I mostly stick to weed, THC concentrates, MDMA, LSD, Mushrooms and DMT. <br />I&#039;m surprised that i was able to quit smoking cigarettes!<br /><br /><br /><br />Personally, i would say try some good coke one night with your friends, and try to refrain from there. <br />Just my 2 cents tho

				I say try a little just once.&nbsp; Cokes something thats fun, but brings out the extremes in people- so keep that in mind.&nbsp; I have dabbled before a line here a line there, I dont care for it, makes me jittery and i always wake up with a headache, but for the first little bit I feel like superman.&nbsp; Know yourself and take the advice of people.&nbsp; My mottos, if you&#039;re curious try everything once, but keep yourself in check because things can get out of hand quickly, but a few bumps at the club isn&#039;t going to ruin your life.

				I tried it once. I use methamphetamine heavily, and stimulants/uppers are definitely my drugs of choice, but honestly I was severely underwhelmed by cocaine. I would actually go as far as saying that I didn&#039;t like it. It just made my nose/throat numb and the rush was almost non-existant. <br /><br />Maybe what I had was shit, maybe my meth use ruined coke for me, I don&#039;t know. But my point is, it&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to try it and automatically become addicted. You might hate it! Personally I would like to try everything once, you only have one life you know.

				I&#039;ve never done coke but I imagine that a huge factor in getting addicted is how available it is. I am sure that I personally would not get addicted simply because I barely have enough money on a regular basis to buy even weed, and the only way I could get coke is through the circuitous process SR requires. I would order it once for a special occasion and then not have the chance to do it again for ages. Because you say your friends do it regularly, you would have the opportunity (probably) to do it as often as you please. <br /><br />I have also heard that it&#039;s not worth it because it doesn&#039;t last very long (ie: you have to keep doing lines). But if you&#039;re like me, you won&#039;t take anyone&#039;s word for it, and will just want to try it once anyway. Just be careful!
