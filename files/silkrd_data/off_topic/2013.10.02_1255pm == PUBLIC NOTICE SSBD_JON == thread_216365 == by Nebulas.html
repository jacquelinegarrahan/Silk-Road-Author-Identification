				SSBD, let me explain how I found this information out.<br /><br />I read into your profile and a few other profiles and ordered from a few different vendors you had talked positively of. I matched this with accounts I suspected to be your shills.<br /><br />I collected post marks, and discovered it was all central to one small part in Florida. All these vendors were very very very &quot;fe&quot; type vendors who seemed sketchy as hell to me. Most of them shipped to AUS<br /><br />I used this area and looked up the location on lbc. No surprise someone was selling a massive amount of BTC. This person had your same syntax. I texted this phone number.<br /><br />You confirmed 100% it was you because you sarcastically used the word &quot;mate&quot; over and over and even called me coachella twice.<br /><br />Using your lbc&nbsp; username, I found all of the above information via google.<br /><br />You have been compromised. I regret nothing. You are a scammer.<br /><br />You have 2 hours from this post to admit the truth, or I will continue.

				Samesame you drive a nice car......... Btw Nebulas I think if you were even remotely correct then your thread and all threads quoting that info would be long since deleted since he is an admin. On the other hand you just clearly stated you contacted this guy on his cell phone in this small FL town trying to buy btc. It would be very very easy for LE right now to look up this guys cell records and see who YOU are. As a vendor you should be safer than this.

				I think this is hilarious considering I know that JSN isn&#039;t anywhere near florida. Nothing this guys says can possibly be true. That ebay seller is even more funny because there isn&#039;t much money being funneled through that ebay account if you look at the listings.

Nothing this guys says can possibly be true. That ebay seller is even more funny because there isn&#039;t much money being funneled through that ebay account if you look at the listings. I am just wondering why someone would put so much effort into trying to reveal someones real identity and clearly be wrong about it. This person must have absolutely no life at all.....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I want to comment on this ebay thing.<br /><br />It does not matter the price he buys it at. To launder the money he needs a record of sales for anything. The amount he &quot;sells&quot; these items for are a completely different thing.

				So how about you take pictures of the text messages with a camera or another phone so we can see this &quot;proof.&quot; As of right now, it is all hearsay.<br /><br />And about the ebay thing, what I mean is there isn&#039;t a sufficient enough amount of money going through that account to mean anything. It wouldn&#039;t hide much money at all.<br /><br />You call me unintelligent, but your story has a lot of holes in it that make no sense. I don&#039;t even know who these people are (SSBD, daruthless1, etc) but I am getting sick of seeing all the posts and threads from new accounts about this. It is really getting old. <br /><br />If you have solid proof, post it ALL and stop being such a damn pussy dragging this shit out like the drama queen you are.
