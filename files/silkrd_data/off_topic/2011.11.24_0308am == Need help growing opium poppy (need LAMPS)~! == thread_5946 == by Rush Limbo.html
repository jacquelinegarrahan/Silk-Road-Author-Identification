				Hi gang!<br />So the lack of raw opium on the SL got me growing my own Papaver Somniferum (opium poppy). They are going great, I have around 25 plants going but I noticed they&#039;re growing rather slow. I also live in an area where they do not get enough sun light right now. I need to get a HID light to simulate sun light.<br /><br />I found this: http://www.hidhut.com/catalog/150-hps-sun-system-complete-kit-p-1427.html<br /><br />I understand that 200+/-50 Watts will be enough for a small growing area (2x2 feet). I need some one to recommend a good light fixture. Please don&#039;t recommend 1000W bulbs because I can&#039;t afford the attention from the power company when my power bill suddenly skyrockets. I want an all-in-one setup to keep things simple for now.<br /><br />If you have any experience growing weed indoors, please let me know which setup you use.<br /><br />Thanks guys!<br />

				They are really best in the areas that you can grow them outside. You should also get lights that dont emit so much heat. Florescent lights are the best for staying stealthy because they dont create heat and they dont use much energy.

Is that true? Also, I am growing some outside, about half of them in fact, but again, my climate is not ideal for poppies :-( it&#039;s way too hot here, so I&#039;m doing it indoors with A/C and I need extra light, this way they&#039;ll feel like they&#039;re in a middle of Afghan summer ;-)

				There are helicopters equipted with FLER wich is radar that detects heat. The police look for houses with heat pouring out because that indicates a grow house. Growing poppys is a small step up from weed. I have never grown them so I cant give you advice but if you use lamps that use alot of electricity or produce heat you need to be ready too do something too prevent the police from figuring out whats going on. <br /><br />The best thing too do is just plant them outside in your front yard. Cops dont know what they are lol. You can grown them hidden in plain site.

				Anyone else has light related advice?<br /><br />What do you think about this setup: http://www.hidhut.com/catalog/150-hps-sun-system-complete-kit-p-1427.html

				Rush, to be perfectly honest with you, you better have a giant basement if you are even thinking about realizing a profit from opium. <br />It takes approximately one acre to produce 1kg of opium gum.(I read that in NatGeo)<br />An acre is 43,560 sq&#039;<br />the average home size in the US (assuming you are in US) is approximately 2,700 sq&#039;.&nbsp; <br />Assuming you have a full basement to work with that gives you 2,700sq&#039; of growing space, which is approx 6% of an acre. <br />Six percent of 1k is 60. If you sell your opium at $10 a gram that will give you $600-$360 for four lights plus whatever the going rate for electricity is at your location, minus SR seller acct and shipping supplies you may end up breaking even.<br />So with that being said, I hope you do have a giant basement or house and are able to make this indoor poppy grow a reality as some good, strong opium would surely be a seller and I would be an occasional buyer.<br />Good Luck!

				I say hell yeah, go for it buddy.<br />I grow my own outdoors every year. Just enough to make a few cups of tea, but it&#039;s free!<br />Sorry to bust in on your thread with no light advice.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know which spectrum they prefer but what I do know is they flower opposite of mj. Meaning as the days reach their peak of sunlight is when pods usually start to form.<br />Good luck and enjoy that tasty gum :D

				Towelie - will you come grow some for me?&nbsp; I tried last year, and wound up with &quot;pods&quot; that were drier than old people&#039;s toenails.&nbsp; I thought our climate was pretty Afghanistan-like, but maybe not.&nbsp; Maybe Ill try again.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have a green thumb.&nbsp; *sigh*

				&nbsp; Lrp72, poppies are really really hardy suckers.&nbsp; <br />If you live in an area where it gets dead cold in the winter just find yourself a spot with decent soil: nothing too rich or dead, rough the soil up a little, wait until last frost and then cast your seeds around your chosen area.&nbsp; Water thoroughly to set the seeds in as there is no need to bury them. water occasionally but not too often as they are prone to root rot when they are babies.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once they start to pop up, thin to about 12&quot; between plants.&nbsp; Water occasionally and watch those beauties grow!<br />One thing to remember.&nbsp; If you live in an area where it gets very hot in the summertime you will want to plant in the fall so they have a chance to mature in the warm spring.<br />Happy growing.<br />P.S. Danish flag and the giganteums are really good producers.&nbsp; Stay away from any &quot;peony&quot; types and most that are a vivid purple as those seem to have very low alkaloid content.
