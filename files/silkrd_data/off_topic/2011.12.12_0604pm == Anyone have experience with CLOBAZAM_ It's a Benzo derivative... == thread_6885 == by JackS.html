				Hey everyone<br /><br />I went to my doctor today asking for something to keep me calm during an upcoming flight, as I have a phobia of air travel. He prescribed me Urbanol (Clobazam) 10mg x 10. I have never heard of it and it seems according to Wikipedia that It has only been approved for use of seizures in August this year I think in the states. I stay In South Africa...It has been around for a long time and is used in many countries for it&#039;s anti-anxiety and seizure control properties especially for epilepsy.<br /><br />It is a benzo derivative and the doc told me they prescribe it here for anxiety and depression? I doubt it would help with depression much though...<br />It has a long half life and is supposed to have effects for up to 12 hours!<br /><br />I took 2 10mg pills now whilst I&#039;m high on some Meth and it took the edge off, I feel a lot less anxious but It&#039;s not a strong feeling like any other benzo&#039;s. I can&#039;t feel anything actually physically effecting me like xanax, kpins or valium would yet I am on crystal and have been so for the last 6 hours. I have a small tolerance to crystal by the way. I would normally have anxiety on stimulants but this Clobazam must have worked as I feel completely fine and able to enjoy the meth worry free. It hasn&#039;t given me any hypnotic,muscle relaxant or sedative feelings but I don&#039;t think it has those properties.<br /><br />Does anyone have anymore info on it???

				Well it seems no one is interested or knows about it...<br /><br />I took 10mg sublingual, felt the effects half an hour later. I would compare it to 5 mg diazepam with no muscle relaxation,a bit of a cloudy head,some slight loss of motor control as in I felt a little of balance and focus was impaired too but much less significant than any other Benzo&#039;s. It did however work well as an anti-anxiety drug!<br /><br />Here is a thread-link created by a well-known Bluelighter if you wanna compare it to other Benzo&#039;s:<br /><br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/485261-All-the-basics-of-Benzodiazepines-and-then-some...?highlight=clobazam<br /><br />
