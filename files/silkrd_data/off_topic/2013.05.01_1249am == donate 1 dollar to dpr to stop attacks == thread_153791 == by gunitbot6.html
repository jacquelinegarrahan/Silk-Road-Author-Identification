				there is a 5000 dollar randsom, if we pay then attacks will stop, i know this will make us look weak and send the wrong message to hackers everywhere, but i wouldn&#039;t mind donating 1 dollar, and if 5000 people donate then my road sickness will stop and every ones elses to, theres no guaranty&nbsp; that they will stop but 1 dollar lost is nothing. So whos with me and how can we make this happen, im not a good leader so some one else take the lead. i know some one will say we sholdnt have to donate anything or go on a ego trip , but its just 1 dollar and would you pay a dollar if you could get back on the road right now?

				The money is not the problem.&nbsp; (I dont even see where a ransom has been demanded.)<br /><br />This is about figuring out how to secure the site from future attacks and all that jazz.

				If it was a true story im sure they would want alot more than 5000 this shit is causing mayhem and it would be worth alot more than 5000 and even thinking of giving in is stupid they would be straight back for more never give in.

				There is no evidence there has been an extortion attempted, but no real detail has been communicated to us anyway.<br /><br />The worst thing to do would be to pay an extortionist. Once they get the money, they will keep coming back for more.

				And here&#039;s the problem with this idea. We give in and it&#039;s open season for other hackers to try and do the same shit. Although this whole thing is a drag, one must be patient and have confidence that DPR and the rest of the crew get things back up and running. If anything, send the guys who work behind the scenes the cheddar...<br /><br />&quot;We DO NOT negotiate with terrorist.&quot;
