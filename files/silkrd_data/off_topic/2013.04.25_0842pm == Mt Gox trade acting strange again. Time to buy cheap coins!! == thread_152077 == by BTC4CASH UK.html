				Stop speculating on hypotheticals, people! And stop living for the exchange rates, geesh. Look at the long term and just chill out! It will keep rising, WITH ups and downs, but you&#039;re all fools if you think you can time the markets. Not even pros with years of experience can do that.<br /><br />Just buy for business purposes, and the rest, or part of your profits, hold for the future.<br /><br />goblin
