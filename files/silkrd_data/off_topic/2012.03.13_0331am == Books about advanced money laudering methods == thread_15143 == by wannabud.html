				Well, let&#039;s say a illegal active make you have much more money than you can explain.<br /><br />You can buy a Hummer and get a IRS auditor in you door next week, or you can launder the money first.<br /><br />Does anybody know some literature that treats only about his specific subject in a technical way? I&#039;m not looking for novel/fiction that addresses the issue very poor (like the Wolf of Wall Street), but some specific.<br /><br />No, I&#039;m not rich as consequence of illegal active. Actually, in Brazil, if you pay the taxes, the Lion does not give a shit to what you do. The richest man in my country know that very well (look at forbes list, the guy became rich in 5 minutes without any explanation). Here you just need to buy a empty mining, buy gold from other gold miners, sell to the state bank and your money is hot (and taxes for mining is very low). If you are so shameless, just build a church or NGO and say the money came from donations, but then you are poking the Lion with a short stick.

				Money Laundering: A Guide for Criminal Investigators, Third Edition <br /><br />The Laundrymen - Inside Money Laundering, The World&#039;s Third Largest Business<br /><br />I haven&#039;t read these, but the descriptions seem as though they deal with the technical aspects.&nbsp; Honestly, I don&#039;t know a thing about money laundering, but I wanted to say that I&#039;m now using this line: &quot;but then you are poking the Lion with a short stick.&quot; whenever someone presents to me a bad idea.<br /><br />E:grammar

				Poke the jaguar with a short stick is a very popular expression in Brazil. I said Lion, because it&#039;s the name of our IRS. Too ironic, since brazilian IRS is the most dangerous predator in this country, even counting Pantanal wetland and Amazon jungle (where we do not have lions).<br /><br />And thanx, I&#039;ll take a look at these books.

I think you can find the link to the library from the hidden wiki. Unfortunately I do not have those links at hand but people all over the forums should know.
