				Sorry boy&#039;s....I was busy IRL and have not logged in since Saturday... So I missed responding and starting up Basketball/sports talk (Lets leave out hockey though ;)<br /><br />I do love how this guy is upset because he read MY THREAD and it was in caps.I always want to know why people are like this? It fascinates me. Like someone hating Howard Stern.....That&#039;s great...don&#039;t listen. No offense to this guy as I have never seen him in here or had a conversation with him. Maybe it&#039;s because he is busy correcting spelng and gramer in another thread....oh well ...onto LeBrick<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169374.msg1218756#msg1218756">Quote from: jnemonic on June 10, 2013, 02:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So your pissed because you lost money to Lebron?<br />Its ok you dont have to shout this name, can see it from here dog. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I lost money on his sorry ass..But that is no big deal...I was more pissed at how over rated LBJ is.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is NO WAY MJ would have EVER lost that game. NEVER. <br /><br />Of curse he is very gifted and awesome basketball player...but he is no MJ. PERIOD.&nbsp; A for the for the record I happen to be a HEATFan.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Not a big enough fan I would name myself after them...But I do like them. More PRE Lebron and a huge fan of Wade.<br /><br />But Since MJ left the NBA....it is just not the same. Kobe is the closest. And I actually watch LeBrick play to watch all the mistakes he makes.<br /><br />And come on Big Bird get YOUR facts straight...I know that is something that is hard for the Mods latly...but.... ;)...I did not bet anything (I tried and was declined...thanks HEATfan;)) And though OF COURSE I was ,ad I lost $$ on game...I wanted to make this thread for a while as there is no sports talk and I know a lot of us are huge fans..and a lot are total nerds and Homo&#039;s( I kidd I Kidd)<br /><br />HF even you have to admit...Lebron shit the bed in game 1. As great as he is..he just does some shit that is normal. MJ/KOBE did nothing normal. I do not believe&nbsp; I ever saw MJ miss a lay up.Or just throw the ball right out of bounds... LBJ does both. <br /><br />They should beat the SPURS(basically one of the worst teams to watch along with Utah)... but even as good as the spurs are....The HEAT should have swept them. <br /><br />MJ would have. :D<br />

They do it for the ratings... no one wants to watch the Spurs (boring team like you said) get horrendously swept because there just won&#039;t be much interest in that. The current state of the HEAT is entertainment first, basketball second. I don&#039;t mind it, but its definitely different from the HEAT I grew up watching. <br /><br />I&#039;m a huge fan of Wade too, easily my favorite player. Its difficult watching him struggle out there. I still think he&#039;s got it, he just needs this off-season to recover. Mark my words though he is going to solidify himself as one of the all-time NBA greats in this Spurs series. I have a feeling its going to be Wade, not James who ends up carrying the team when it matters most. At least I hope so :p<br /><br />But yeah I disagree on everything you say about Lebron. He is definitely the best player to play basketball. Jordan is amazing, no doubt about it, but they play a different game. And if I had to have any one player on my team, it would be Lebron. He does so much more than anyone else in all aspects of the game and he is only getting better every year. With James you never know what is possible. If he truly wants to win I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything that can stop him. <br /><br />HEAT have this series in 6. Next game is probably going into overtime where the HEAT fuck up near the end and lose because of a turnover or something, calling it now. NBA is rigged (but the HEAT will still win).
