				Not really sure what you&#039;re asking. You can sign up for pecunix at pecunix.com. All you need is an email address. It is accessible through tor and from my understanding is completely anonymous. I have even heard that they can&#039;t freeze your account but I am not sure if that is 100% true or not since I have only used pecunix once. You can also get debit cards that can be funded via pecunix but the load prices are kind of high compared to other e currencies. Also, when I used it I had a hard time finding an exchanger that would take western union without high fees. Seriously I wanted to buy $60 and the fee was anywhere from $15-$30. I guess it wouldn&#039;t be so bad if I was moving a large amount of cash.

				He probably wants your account (email address) and account name (display name) from your pecunix account. Iirc that&#039;s all you need to send pecunix.

				Um perhaps he receives a lot of payments and he wants to make sure he knows which one is yours? That&#039;s all I can figure. Maybe check with him direct to make sure he gets what he needs?

				Oh I&#039;ve seen this before.&nbsp; I believe that what the seller is asking is for you to fund a Pecunix account and then briefly turn over that account to the seller. The seller then logs on to your account and makes the transfer himself.&nbsp; You log on later and change your password.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />Kinda weird, but I saw a seller on OVDB require this of buyers.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve never seen a seller briefly take control just to send a payment. create a new account for each deal, and ONLY fund it for that deal. then the seller logs in, changes password and email settings, transfers funds to their account, and leaves that account empty... BTW pecunix can and WILL disable an account suspected of illegal activity or tampering. this is why the account email settings are changed from inside the account, so that you can&#039;t report your own account as stolen, or taking part in illegal activity anymore (email address is account number). this protects the seller from you knowing what their real account number is.
