				<br />-China will be the world&#039;s second largest consumer market by 2015. Currently number three behind the US and Japan.<br /><br />-By 2020, China&#039;s consumer consumption nationwide will amount to 22 per cent of the total global consumption, behind only the US (35 per cent).<br /><br />-Between 2010 and 2020, the number of households in China with an annual disposable income above US$10,000 (in nominal terms) will almost quadruple from 57.1 million households in 2010 to 222 million by 2020.<br /><br />-China&#039;s per-capita G.D.P. is about $7,000, with consumption making up only 35% of the economy, due to the high levels of savings and corporate profits. So China&#039;s per capita consumption -the amount of money the average person spends- is only about $2,500 a year. In the US that figure is about $30,000.<br /><br />-China launched the &#039;world&#039;s largest housing investment program&#039;. As part of its new five-year plan (2011-2015), China will build 36 million affordable homes which, assuming three people to an apartment, is enough to house the combined populations of France, Australia and Canada.<br /><br />-Macau is the world&#039;s top gambling destination, overtaking Las Vegas in total gaming revenues in 2007. Gambling has been legal in Macau, known as the Monte Carlo of the Orient, since 1847 and generates over 40% of Macau&#039;s GDP.<br /><br />-From 2007 to 2009, retail sales in China grew by 25% annually.<br /><br />-Four of the world&#039;s top 10 largest shopping malls are in China, including the world&#039;s number one and two largest.<br /><br />-73% of Chinese surveyed regarded shopping as a leisure activity. 45% identified it as one of their favourite pursuits and just over half said it was among the best ways of spending time with the family. Chinese consumers often shop without any intention of buying. Sometimes they are window-shopping or comparing prices. At other times, they may be shopping as a sport, competing with friends to find the best deals.<br /><br />-The Chinese are extremely brand conscious. 45% of Chinese consumers surveyed believe that higher prices correspond to better quality, compared with just 16% in the US and 8% in Japan.<br /><br />-China possesses about 6% of the world&#039;s total land area on which it must sustain 20% of the world&#039;s population.<br /><br />-China is now the largest food producer in the world. China is the world&#039;s top producer of agricultural products by value, with total production of about 4,078 billion RMB (US$536 billion). Japan is China&#039;s largest food export market.<br /><br />-With almost half a billion pigs, China is the world&#039;s largest pork consumer and producer. China has more pigs than the next 43 largest pork producing countries combined (US is #2 with 65.9 million pigs).<br /><br />-China is the world&#039;s largest producer and consumer of rice.<br /><br />-China is the world&#039;s largest apple producer (followed by the US in second place) and the world&#039;s leading exporter of apple juice.<br /><br />-McDonald&#039;s expects to double the number of locations in China in the span of three years. In 2010, it had about 1,100 outlets but expects to grow to a total of 2,000 stores by 2013. McDonald&#039;s opened its first outlet in Shenzhen in 1990 and employs more than 60,000 people throughout the country.<br /><br />-KFC has over 3,200 outlets throughout China. In 1987, KFC was the first Western fast-food chain to gain entry to the Chinese market. Parent company Yum! also operates 520 Pizza Hut restaurants and 120 home delivery locations in China.<br /><br />-China surpassed Europe as the world&#039;s biggest beer market. According to Credit Suisse&#039;s World Map of Beer, in the space of a couple of decades the country has gone from barely touching a drop to become the world&#039;s biggest beer market, a considerable distance ahead of America. And beer consumption in China is growing by nearly 10% a year.<br /><br />-China, the world&#039;s sixth largest wine producer, will be the world&#039;s top producer by 2058.<br /><br />-An anonymous Chinese phone bidder paid US$232,000 each for three bottles of 1869 Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild at a Sotheby&#039;s auction in Hong Kong smashing the record of $156,450 paid in 1985.<br /><br />-In China, coffee sales in stores more than tripled from 2004 to 2009. In 2009, coffee sales hit 4.6 billion yuan (US$694 million).<br /><br />-Starbucks dominates the Chinese market with around 70% per cent market share.<br /><br />-China is the world&#039;s largest cotton producer and importer. Between 1949 and 2007, China&#039;s annual cotton production has leaped from 440,000 tons to 35.3 million bales, representing almost 30% of the world&#039;s total output.<br /><br />-China is the world&#039;s largest steel producer. In 2009, China&#039;s steel industry produced 567 million metric tons of crude steel, which represented 46.3% of the world&#039;s total output.<br /><br />-China produces 95% of the world&#039;s rare earth metals, which are critical in the manufacture of many high-tech products ranging from smartphones to smart bombs.<br /><br />-China is also the world&#039;s leading producer of aluminium, antimony, barite, coal, fluorspar, graphite, iron and steel, lead, tin, tungsten, and zinc.<br /><br />-China produced almost 50% of the world&#039;s flat glass and cement in 2006.<br /><br />-China is the world&#039;s largest producer of gold, after taking the top spot in 2008 from South Africa, which was the world&#039;s top producer since 1905. China produced 276 metric tons of gold in 2007, representing over 10% of the world&#039;s total.

				I still see no reason why this would make us speak Chinese. Spanish seems more likely as they are growing more rapidly than anything else in our country.

				China (with long range ICBMs and SCBMs) + Their close allies (N. Korea, who test nuclear weapons without concern) + Iran (producing weapons grade nuclear fuel, which is undoubtedly being smuggled into china and N. Korea) + Russia (they just hate us) + A,Q, Khan smuggling&nbsp; detailed blueprints for the construction of ZIPPE type centrifuges to Pakistan ... and then the rest of the world (they were found when Libya agreed to dismantle it&#039;s nuclear program) = LOSE<br /><br />Maraging Steel (only the US currently has the capacity to produce it) is the only thing holding China back from nuking whoever the fuck they want (it&#039;s required to separate the primary fissle plug from it&#039;s fusion target&#039;s deuterium/tritium fuel).<br /><br />Either way we lose, it&#039;s just a matter of when :/

				Here&#039;s where you&#039;re wrong regarding your statement saying steel is the only thing stopping China from nuking whomever they want whenever:<br /><br />1. Russia hates China as much as they hate us, perhaps even more so. Look at a foreign policy overview regarding the two.&nbsp; Russia also has the largest unprotected border in the world with China.<br /><br />2. You&#039;ve obviously never heard of the term MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) nor the concept of deterrence. Time for you to do some reading.<br /><br />2. An active and at all times deployed force of nuclear-armed submarines such as the US&#039;s fleet, which is unparallelled by any other navy around the world, acts as a capable deterrent to any nuclear armed country. The US Navy, with some of the most sophisticated sensory equipment in the whole world, can&#039;t even track one of it&#039;s own submarines when the ship is running at full stealth capacity.&nbsp; 150+ high yield Trident class missiles can turn pretty much any and all of China&#039;s major population centers into giant craters in a single volley.<br /><br />3. The US has an extremely sophisticated early warning and launch sensing network in place to track potential ICBM/SLBM launches. Any launch would easily be detected and responded to in kind (look up MAD to see the importance of this capability and how it meshes with the US military&#039;s SIOP.<br /><br />4. Look up the difference between strategic and non strategic weapons. China has absolutely no ability (due to their lack of strategic nuclear weapons) to eliminate the LAND BASED US nuclear second strike capability through a first strike attack, let alone the subs. Attacking the USA would ensure their own destruction.<br /><br />5. Sheer nuclear weapons numbers game: America has 20x the nukes china has in active service and ready for immediate deployment. They may have more people than us, but nuclear weapons somewhat solve that issue don&#039;t they ;).<br /><br />Conclusion: 180 ICBMs (which not all of their nukes are to begin with, China only has 2 silo compounds and in reality probably can only launch 15 or so within a 24 hour period, which frankly wouldn&#039;t even matter given the US would have turned the whole country into a giant fucking wasteland by that point) can&#039;t match up with 500+ ICBMs in service, each capable of carrying more than one warhead and therefore striking multiple targets. This doesn&#039;t even consider other ballistic missile delivery systems the US has in service nor conventional deployents, such as nuclear capable stealth bombers (which the chinese do not have), plane based cruise missiles, et cetera. In reality, a strike of 20 warheads on China&#039;s major population centers would utterly cripple the country, let alone only 20% of the warheads the USA has in active service (that would be roughly 1000). The US would easily service inactive warheads to replenish stocks, leaving us with a healthy 9000 count nuclear stockpile to dawdle with any other potential threats as well.<br /><br />The last thing China wants is a nuclear confrontation. America would win without a question.<br />

				It&#039;s all about the BRICs - just have a read of some of the material Jim O&#039;Neill who coined the term about China has written.&nbsp; China&#039;s growth is something like 1 x Greece GDP every 12 weeks.

				sending kids overseas in china for education (a large part for the language skills) is now no where nearly as highly thought of as 5-10 years ago.&nbsp; Chinese might not become the no.1 language for a whole host of reasons and the general dominance of the English language but the Chinese are going to be the big guns in the next 5+ years.
