				Hey all, I will be hosting a ketamine night some time soon... After making a thread about ketamine a week ago, a lot of people were interested in buying ketamine. I suggested that we have a night taking ketamine together here on the forums. I&#039;d like to know when is best for everyone and come up with a date when it&#039;s on&nbsp; ;D. I&#039;ll have some K by Friday but I&#039;m saving it for the SR K night. Let me know when is best for you and we&#039;ll make a date that suits everyone. Cheers&nbsp; 8)

				Hope it comes through in time for you mate&nbsp; :). I&#039;m pretty exited... I was thinking Monday but I would rather have it when there&#039;s a good number of people down for it 8). I&#039;m hoping 15+ people will join... the more the merrier!

				I love doing 30mg bumps, wait at least 30 min to an hour and do another 30mg bump and you&#039;ll feel fantastic. I personally don&#039;t like diving into k-holes so this method works best for me.

He posts it from the UK and takes about 2 days to arrive (Buy Monday to Receive Wednesday). I&#039;m going to do a full review of it when I take it properly in this thing later.

				I must say. The M-Hole is much more comfortable than the K-hole. With the K-Hole there is lot of mindfucking and you feel naked and adrift in a sea of madness. The M-Hole almost feels like Im in a safety bubble of observastion within a torrential chaos and although venturing out of the bubble (standing up and wandering around) leads to confusion and loss of coordination. I can somewhat interact with the things inside my bubble (My computer, ashtray, pipe etc....) <br /><br />I shall dub this feeling &quot;Selective Dissociation&quot;<br /><br />Much more friendly IMHO

You get S-Isomer, R-Isomer and the ratioed mix (my personal favourite). Basically one of them lasts less time and is more hallucinogenic and the other lasts longer and is less so (this is what I have always found anyway). <br /><br />&nbsp;

Most brands contain equal mixtures of the S(+) and R(-) isomers (racemic ketamine), but at least one brand has been found to contain only the S(+) isomer. According to Jansen, S(+) ketamine is more likely to suppress breathing, induces a faster loss of consciousness, and has a quicker recovery time (Jansen, 2000). Jansen also states that S(+) ketamine is a more potent psychedelic drug than R(+) ketamine, but he does not elaborate as to how.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />See last sentence :) Never had R-isomer keta so can&#039;t really compare. <br /><br />

You have to both get the amounts and ratio of Ket to MDMA right and also time it right. What Limetless said before is correct. It basically makes you roll higher (more intense), make you have more rolls, and make each roll last longer.<br /><br />I find it less effective if you&#039;re tired, you need to have energy, otherwise the Ket can just knock you out, so a sleep before hand is a good idea.

With what you get from the vendors on here you should probs do no more than 75mg)<br />K - 50-75mg (depending on how much of a wobble you want)<br />MDMA - 100mg<br />Meph - 50-75mg <br /><br />Mix the Meph and the Bing together FIRST and put that into 1 line, then put the K and the MD crizzles into 1 line, split the Meph and Bing line into 2, half on each side of the K and MD line, and then push each one into the left and right side of the Meph and Bing line so you get a nice even distribution (this will make it go up nice and less of a sting).<br /><br />You might be able to tell I&#039;ve done this before..... ;)&nbsp; 8)

				Hey guys Just got done catching up on the thread after getting back from the store (nothing stranger, than trying to buy a bunch of groceries at public place whilst being 24 hours into an MXE bender.<br />Too answer a couple of unanswered questions I saw pop up:<br /><br />M-hole is not moxy (although I have some in my bag that I haven&#039;t got around to taking yet). It is the MXE equivalent of a K-hole<br /><br />Yes...It is very hard to sleep on or after MXE. I&#039;ve tried several times in the past 12 hours. and the more I try to relax, the more I start tripping again and realize that I&#039;m wired as shit.<br /><br />That zombie/bathsalt thing has been all over the news in my neck of the woods lately. The funniest I have heard yet was a speech by some police chief, warning everyone of the dangers of this new &quot;Bath Salts-LSD&quot; But I think it is strange that none of the news agencies are questioning why the victim was naked too. <br />My speculation is that the whole thing is just a random ass incident that happened to get caught on tape in public and some kind of research chemical just happened to be involved. And now the cops are trying to use this as scare tactic example for the sheeple of america to raise a puplic fear of random, unknown Research chemical highs. And that will lead to another massive ban. Its like what happened to salvia when kids started making youtube videos of themselves on it.

				I would definitely agree that Googleyed&#039;s Mephedrone is of very good quality; much better than the stuff you would get on the streets now.<br /><br />The weight has always been generous (being slightly over each time) and he has even been kind enough to include a little something extra which is excellent, and makes him shine as a true credit to SR :)<br /><br />So overall I would definitely recommend Googleyed to anyone who is thinking of buying from him.<br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />worldinyourhands

				is K something that grows on you? its just im not sure i like it on its own, i done 35mg and it made me feel like i was tipsy and made doing anything a huge effort even typing, and it didnt last very long at all, less than half hour, i know your ment to keep bumping but it didnt make me feel like i wanted anymore cos i was kinda glad when it went away and now im starving, going to mix with mdma tomorrow night to see what thats like, but K alone? im not convinced its a nice buzz, i know i only did a little but i was being cautious as it was first time, maybe i need to do more? i just get the feeling it will feel the same just more intense, the reason i ask if it grows on you is because i didnt like weed the first few times but it grew on me and now i smoke like a chimney, i dont know maybe its just not my cuppa tea, i enjoy fast drugs like mdma, mda, coke etc. <br /><br />will mix with mdma tomorrow but should i mix it with mdma and bomb or bump K and bomb mdma?&nbsp;

You bomb the MDMA first (in a small bit of drink is good), then snort the Ket later (after an hour, maybe 1.5 hours).<br /><br />You&#039;ll feel high as kite. Best high ever.

				bomb the MDMA first, then, seeing as you&#039;re not used to it, only snort about 50mg of k when you&#039;re on a good roll. I did a pill last weekend and snorted 80mg about an hour into it - feels pretty fucking awesome mate &gt;:D

				Ahh, yeah K on its own isn&#039;t as good as good as it is with other drugs. MDMA + K is meant to be good, so looking forward to hearing how that goes.<br /><br />If you like &#039;Fast&#039; drugs, you&#039;ll love Mephedrone! It&#039;s the most euphoric stim I&#039;ve ever had!

				i finally found the time to explore the depth of ketamine...<br /><br />the first time i tried K i was worried about the hole thing as from an outside view it looks scary but oh my god was i wrong, when you get there its the best place ever, i dont have much memory of getting there or coming back but what i can remember is my own voice inside my head and the complex way it makes you think and question what it was all about, i did a line 60-70mg then another then another after the third things where getting hard to do and i must have gone in to a hole although i cant remember actually going there, and while i was there i was amazed at how odd everything was, the way i thought about things, its like being able to have a convocation with yourself and get answers back but answers that you have not thought had to think about, my eyes must have been shut or just not working cos i cant remember seeing anything, one thing i thought would be scary was not being able to move but you are not even aware your body exists so not being able to move does not even come in to it. <br /><br />i saved some, that i thought would be enough to get back in to a hole but unlucky for me i must have just been short cos instead of making me drowsy it gave me a huge boost of energy, i must have hit that sweet spot in between by complete chance, when you are in a k hole its so peaceful and tranquil&nbsp; and a complete escape form real life, no one could bug you even if they wanted to. <br /><br />im defo going to order more soon but im also now interested in the difference between K an MXE. <br />can some one try and explain please&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
