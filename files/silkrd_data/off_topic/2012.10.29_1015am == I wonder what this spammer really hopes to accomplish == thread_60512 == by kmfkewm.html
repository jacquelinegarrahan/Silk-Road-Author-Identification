				Ostensibly it is the promotion of the scam, but I don&#039;t necessarily buy it. Only a complete retard would fall for this. It makes it look even less legitimate than it already did at first for it to be ultra spammed on every single subforum. Scammers generally try to at least look legitimate, although some target idiots it can&#039;t possibly be effective for them to spam every single subforum versus trying to maintain a single post on every subforum.

				that is true, when theres only one or two posts i dont notice them nearly as easily<br /><br />i think you would be surprised how many members, especially those who are new, actually ended up falling for it and losing at least a small amount of money. i know of a few at least so i am sure there are more who are unwilling to admit it...<br /><br />pretty sure at this point he is just attempting to piss us off

				I&#039;m sure some people get caught up in it. Maybe some who aren&#039;t fluent in English and just see the page as new way to get btc.<br /><br />If it wasn&#039;t working, I don&#039;t think they would be spamming here still.
