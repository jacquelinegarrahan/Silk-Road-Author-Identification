				I have one for you - pretty topical also<br /><br />BACKGROUND: This is London, in a recession, the Public Sector is finally getting hit with the cuts the private sector has been enduring for three years and so it is having an effect on the Civil Service entrance tests<br /><br />CUT TO SCENE: Whitehall, a tall, smart-looking late 20s chap knocks on the door and walks into the office, a slight limp and rather short haircut the only things out of place with his grey suit fitting in with the rest of them... the Senior Civil Servant looks up - <br /><br />&quot;Ah, Braithwaite, come in...&quot;<br />&quot;Morning Sir&quot;<br />&quot;No need to sir, me, young man - you&#039;re not in the army now! I see you have been let go?&quot;<br />&quot;Spot of bother in Afghan - got too close to an IED after an all-night defuse job&quot;<br />&quot;Not to worry - all in one piece, by the look of it&quot;<br /><br />The ex Para hesitates, starts to reply and doesn&#039;t...<br /><br />The Civil Servant continues... <br /><br />&quot;Well look, I&#039;m not going to waste time with an interview - you look alright, have a decent education and the Army has surely taught you some discipline, we can use you for sure. Any thing you want to tell me before we sign the contract?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, Sir - I mean Mister Foulkes-Warner - I do have a couple of disabilities you should know about...&quot;<br />&quot;Disabilities?? Excellent!! That should help me hit my targets AND get you in on a higher grade. Tell me...&quot;<br />&quot;Well, I am allergic to caffeine - too many all-night bomb disposal jobs and drinking red bulls have shot me to shreds&quot;<br />&quot;Not a problem&quot;<br />&quot;Also, I&nbsp; - ahemmmm - have no - ahemmmm - goulies left..&quot;<br />&quot;What?&quot;<br />&quot;I had to have my scrotum chopped off when an IED peppered it with nails&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh DEAR - I am sorry, old chap! - Not painful now, I trust?&quot;<br />&quot;Bit of a limp still, but I&#039;ll survive and it does have some advantages&nbsp; - won&#039;t be chased by any wannabe mothers!&quot;<br /><br />The Civil Servant looks faintly amused and embarrassed, realises he needs to change his original decision about placing Braithwaite in the Foreign Office...<br /><br />&quot;I think I have the perfect place for you, Braithwaite - you can join the Education Department, liaising closely with the senior Head-Teachers.&quot;<br />&quot;Really, sir?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes, I think it&#039;s perfect for you - accelerated pension-scale and private health care&quot;<br />&quot;What hours do they work, Sir&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, fairly standard - ten til four - nothing too strenuous, BUT you won&#039;t need to go in until noon&quot;<br />&quot;Noon, Sir? I thought you said they started at Ten&quot;<br />&quot;They do - but you won&#039;t&quot;<br />&quot;Really?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes - ALL THEY DO IS SIT AROUND DRINKING COFFEE AND SCRATCHING THEIR BALLS FOR THE FIRST TWO HOURS, ANYWAY...!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;8) 8)

				A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse. &#039;&#039;But why?&#039;&#039; they asked, as they moved off. &#039;&#039;because,&#039;&#039; he said &#039;&#039;I can&#039;t stand chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.&#039;&#039;

				A sex psychologist is conducting phone polling about married couples sex lives. She calls up one house and starts to ask the woman about her sex life. One of the questions is &quot;How often do you have intimate relations?&quot;. The woman replies that she has sex 4-5 times a week. The psychologist asks several more questions and then asks to talk to the woman&#039;s husband. While interviewing the husband she asks him the same question about how often he has sex. He replies that he has sex once a week. The psychologist is puzzled and inquires, &quot;You&#039;re wife said she has she 4-5 times a week, but you said you only have sex once a week, is this correct?&quot;. The man gruffly responds, &quot;Yeah, and that&#039;s the way its gonna be til we dun gone payed off the second mortgage.&quot;

				A little boy hears his parents fighting, he hears the words &#039;stupid cunt&#039; and &#039;bitch&#039;. The next day he asks his dad what they mean, and he, being caught off guard, says &quot;Well son, a stupid cunt is a beautiful woman, and a bitch is a nice looking gentleman. The kid says &#039;okay&#039; and his dad thinks he&#039;s forgotten about it.<br /><br />The next day, he hears his dad say &quot;Shit!&quot; because he cut himself shaving. The little boy asks him what the word means, and his dad, once again being caught off, says &quot;it means shaving cream son, now go play.&quot;<br /><br />After a week, his parents are having a very important dinner with one of his dads business clients and his wife. As the little boy gets dressed, he sees his dad shaving. He goes downstairs, and his mom cuts herself as shes carving the turkey. She says &quot;Fuck, that hurt.&quot;. The little boy says, &quot;what?&quot; his mom says &quot;Oh, nothing son, it means &#039;cut&#039;, thats all.&quot;<br /><br />The doorbell rings, the client and his wife arrived earlier than expected, so his mom tells the boy to answer the door, he opens the door, and says &quot;Hello sir, you certainly do look like quite the bitch, and your wife, oh, what a stupid cunt she is. If you&#039;ll follow me, my dads upstairs cleaning the shit off of his face and my moms in the kitchen fucking the turkey.&quot;<br /><br />8)

				I&#039;m waiting on my changa too :)<br />Here&#039;s a joke:<br /><br />A kid asks his dad: &quot;What&#039;s politics?&quot;<br />The dad thinks how to explain such a complex thing to his son, and says: &quot;Son, I&#039;ll explain it with an example. I work and I bring money home, so I&#039;m the capitalist, mum manages the money, so she&#039;s the government, the housekeeper is the working class. You are growing up and you have some voice in, so you&#039;re the people. Your sister, who is just born, is the future.&quot;<br /><br />The kid goes to sleep, but in the middle of the night his sister starts crying, so he looks for someone around the house. He doesn&#039;t find his dad, his mum dismisses him because she wants to sleep and he finds the housekeeper in bed with his dad.<br />He goes back to his sister and says to her: &quot;I&#039;ve understood what politics is: the capitalists fuck the working class, the government sleeps, nobody listens to the people and the future is in deep shit!&quot;

				There&#039;s this man who drinks beer at a local bar every night. One night, he came in and had nothing to drink. The bartender was curious and asked him why he wasn&#039;t drinking anything.<br /><br />The man replied, &quot;I don&#039;t drink anymore... Last night, I blew chunks.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh that&#039;s nothing&quot;, the bartender replies. &quot;Everyone gets a little sick after drinking at times!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, No&quot;, the man replies. &quot;You don&#039;t understand.
