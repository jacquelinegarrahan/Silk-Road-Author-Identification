				Hello,<br />I&#039;d need a referral code for SoS as well. As it turns out, rating would become more and more useful to me and people that know me can tell I wouldn&#039;t pull any shit with it. So, anyone has a referral code over for me? If you want anything for it, well - let me know what you deem fair!<br />Much love<br />M

				dont ask for it in publicity would be the first step to get one.<br /><br />Make some &quot;friends&quot; build trust and then you will get one. <br /><br />The thing is, if someone refers a person and this person makes some bad moves, this person can get banned for just referring someone, too.<br /><br />For this reason I wouldnt invite someone I dont know.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Yeah, thanks for the advice. Basically, I have &quot;friends&quot;, but I don&#039;t want to spam them up with my begging ;) Thus I just figured if one stumbles upon here and has a space code they&#039;ll hook me up. I am trustable, people like nomad and others know that. Now, I had a code on OVDB but I didn&#039;t register while OVDB was up and now the code is in my message folder over there. Thus it&#039;s basically lost :(<br /><br />Much love,<br />M

(They won&#039;t really sell it because that would put them in danger.)

				I&#039;d understand if anyone doesn&#039;t want to send me a code right now cos i&#039;m still pretty much a noob. But down the line put down as someone who&#039;s definitely interested in a referral code.
