				Im not an American but to me it seems like a ridiculous holiday and certainly nothing to celebrate, the genocide of over 500 Nations of indigenous people isnt something positive or to be proud of at all, its primitive to celebrate such atrocities.

Of course not, because not only were they brutally murdered but today, their slaughters are declared a holiday and celebrated. Might as well make a holiday for Hitler and the Holocaust too..

Native Americans aren&#039;t people, you see. I guess it just took people 500 years to realize he was mistaken.<br /><br />In seriousness, though, I don&#039;t think anybody celebrates the slaughter of the native peoples. They just don&#039;t teach that it happened, and so kids get indoctrinated into a fairytale version of America wherein everyone from Columbus to the current President are all heroes and saints (with the possible exception of the last President from the party not currently in power), and by the time they are adults they actively resist any fact that challenges the fairytale. Simply put, many people just don&#039;t believe that Columbus killed anyone at all. Especially the sort of &quot;conservative&quot; who always seems to want to &quot;return&quot; to a past where things were better than they are now. Everything falls apart for that person if he finds out that the mythic figures who peopled his mythic past were really a bunch of bastards.

				American holidays are fucked right up.... Christmas, how the hell did that turn into a fat, bearded guy, delivering presents on a sleigh pulled by flying reindeer? ... Easter... A bunny that hides eggs in your house? ... Thanksgiving.... eat turkey and watch football....<br /><br />Its unfortunate that every single holiday that is celebrated....especially here in the USA....is celebrated for reasons totally unrelated to the original purpose of the holiday.&nbsp; More people think of presents than Jesus when it comes to Christmas....and I&#039;m not a religious person at all, but seriously its fucked up...<br /><br />Also, what does a &quot;proper celebration&quot; of Columbus Day consist of? haha..... where is the mythological being that sneaks into your house to give you shit? ...well there is none...so this holiday is overlooked by 99% of the American population.... Just another day that mail wont come... therefore another day my drugs wont come...Fuck you Christopher Columbus!!<br /><br />I know its not just us Americans who celebrate Christmas and what not, but our lack of a real culture, and our interest in &quot;stuff&quot; , makes us look like morons when we &quot;celebrate&quot; our &quot;holidays&quot; ... haha ......... word to your moms!<br /><br />Assignment: ask 10 American kids what the meaning of Christmas is........ see how many answers about Santa and presents you get ... haha ;)
