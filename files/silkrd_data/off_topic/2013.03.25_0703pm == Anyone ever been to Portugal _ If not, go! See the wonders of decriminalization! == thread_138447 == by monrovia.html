				I had an awesome experience when I went there. In case you don&#039;t know, ALL drugs in personal use quantities are decriminalized there, and the policy is actually working quite well. In the capitol city I visited for a few days(I was in the Azores, not the mainland) there were tons of kids who would smoke hash/weed(mostly hash, being so close to morocco and all) in the open at nighttime, and no one would bother them if they weren&#039;t causing a scene. I also had the chance to get my hands on some fine Moroccan hash from a friendly, dark skinned, Portuguese speaking(obviously) kid who was nice enough to provide me with a gram of hash for 15 euros as long as I smoked a tiny bit of it with him. It was just really cool to hang out with some locals for a few minutes and try to communicate through the minor language barrier we had(I speak very little Portuguese, and he spoke a little English.) The attitude of police over there are very different than in the US as well. No cops on every corner trying to bust you for speeding. I think I could have counted the number of speed limit signs the whole 2 weeks I was there on one hand. The 2 times a saw a cop that I can remember was when we got into an accident the first day we were there, and when we were parked a block down from a police station at a coffee shop. We were parked illegally, and a cop walked right by us on his way to get a cup for himself. He obviously saw us, but didn&#039;t say a word. I hated my country(USA) just a little bit more than I already did when I got back. It has since become a goal of mine to move there permanently at some point of my life. It&#039;s where my ancestry is and it&#039;s just a naturally beautiful place.

Are you Portuguese at all by any chance or did you just happen to choose the country by chance(or other factors.) If you ever have the chance to go to the Azores, GO!!!!!! It&#039;s beautiful. My dad was born there, and when he went on his honeymoon after he moved to the states, he was pissed, saying &quot;what the hell, I grew up in a place that looked just like this!&quot; The culture is right up my alley too(at least as far as the islands are concerned,) very laid back and everyone is friendly and willing to help out complete strangers.<br /><br />EDIT: Also, were you able to sample any &quot;wares&#039; while you were there? The hash i smoked was VERY potent. I can&#039;t comment on the taste, because I smoked it in the form of spliffs, but it got me blitzed nonetheless. On a side note too, my family and I went to a (sort of) night club, and the people on that particular island have an infatuation with American 80&#039;s pop music. Really strange, haha. And another question, how would you compare the size/population density of Lisbon to that of a major American city such as LA, Chicago, Boston, NYC, etc?

				Nah unfortunately not but from what i know about it it looks amazing. I&#039;m not of portugese descent but i do have a few relatives in the pombal area. I sampled a lot of wares haha ; boom festival is predominately trance which brings insane amounts of drugs. I cant be sure if people had brought it along from their home country or what not but most of the drugs i had there were TOP notch :) I was mainly smoking hash while there as im not a big skunk fan in the first place and will buy good quality hash over skunk any day of the week,&nbsp; (though im forced to smoke skunk when back home), i think i got hash off someone different every day aswell which was a treat&nbsp; :D It was my first time on mescaline while there too. I tripped on lucy twice and shrooms once &amp; had various other things. Really was amazing, drugs wernt the factor that made it so good but when your there for 8 days and in that environment it just aids you very nicely :) Also im not from US and havnt been yet, i live in the UK but compared to the UK and the part i live in its alot more sparsely populated. Though the size of the city makes it seem more cramped, has alot more closed streets by small buildings and such.<br /><br />Heres a vid of the fest i was at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vHSUpmNsM<br />

I had read on erowid that it was OTC over there, but every pharmacy I checked out needed a prescription. Like I said though, I was in the Azores, and the laws might be slightly different over there...<br /><br />On another note, I think the world is ignoring the results of Portugal decriminalizing ALL drugs for personal use. if I remember correctly, addiction, crime, overdoses, etc, has gone down significantly, and citizen/police relations have gotten better, since the policy was implemented. it makes me even more proud of my heritage.
