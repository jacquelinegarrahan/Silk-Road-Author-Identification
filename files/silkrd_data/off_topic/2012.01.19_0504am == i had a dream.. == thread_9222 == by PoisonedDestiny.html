				It doesn&#039;t matter who is elected president, it&#039;s not like the president has any power. That&#039;s why we get to vote for him!<br />But the end of the world is near anyway, we should just have fun while we have time..

				BAAAHAHAHAHAHAA!! Is it december 21st, 2012 *Australian* time, or *American* time, or *Greenwich Mean* time? BAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />I called my cousin in Aus, in 1999 to ask if the world ended! AHAHAHAHAHA<br />&quot;Each generation says their time has come, clutching at the threat of marytrdumb&quot; ~Oderus Urungus (Most High Profit)<br />I like the commercials that say Nostradamus predicted the end of the world in 2012, I say, go read some Nostradamus.....what&#039;sgoing onin year 4000?? <br />Also, are we going by the Christian linear calendar, to base our times on Mayan Solar Calendar?? <br />Is it year 2012, or year 465 million? Or year 6 billion?<br />If you TRULY believe it&#039;s ending, would you sign all of your worldly possessions over to me? I will let you keep them and use them, but @ 00:01 on Dec 22nd, 2012, I take possession....you won&#039;t need it, right? Dealio? Cars, houses, everything. <br />And to &quot;survivors&quot;, I ask you...do you have a Dr. in the house?? BAAAHAHAHAHAHA<br />Sorry, y&#039;all. <br /><br />@ PoisonedDestiny: AWESOME DREAM!!<br /><br />@Aliahad: I bet a few people do.

				i have enough dreams about the end of the world!!!&nbsp; <br />usually solar event, killing electrical transmission and causing a collapse of civilization while civilization still stands kind of thing.<br /><br />are all our brains worried about something?<br /><br />also i see the signs for a tipping point now ending the drug war.&nbsp; but i dunno if everything will keep going as normal till then.&nbsp; i think we&#039;re going to get a reset..&nbsp; not wiped out, just taught again where we come from.&nbsp; i dunno.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(<br /><br />now what would be awesome is if we had an actual date and then could literally throw a SR party somewhere.&nbsp; like everyone bring everything (vendors, etc) and not like we&#039;ll get arrested.&nbsp; we&#039;ll all just go out in a blaze lol<br /><br />*destiny*

				That would be cool as fuck. My view on the end of the world is that while we are alive, we aren&#039;t meant to worry about an afterlife. That&#039;s not to say there is/isn&#039;t one, though.

And a bunch of people hyped up by NON scientific research. <br />Watch some Ancient Aliens. Better yet, go to Mexico, and ask the current Mayan&#039;s what is going to happen. <br />The Hopi&#039;s say something will happen this year...ever met a Hopi?? They have degraded their culture to one of booze and drugs. They lie in the street passed out, and shitting their pants. Literally. Go to a Native Reservation ANYWHERE in the desert Southwest, and ask yourself if you trust the prophecies they tell you? BAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. <br />The white man has a god complex. <br />A calamity
