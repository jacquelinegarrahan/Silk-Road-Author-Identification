				Don&#039;t bother with the Smack-Pills AJ, it&#039;s pointless. Like the guy above said Smacks BA is so low orally that you are just gunna dent yourself money. The rest sounds like a plan though mate. :)<br /><br />Fair play on the stamps though, those pics show true grit. Although the one on the left looks like the transformers logo?&nbsp; :-\ I never seen Pokeballs though so whatever, just making a comment. <br /><br />Good luck though AJ, looks promising so far! +1 Karma for having the stones to show face.<br />

				Lol thanks limitless they will be double sided deceptacon pokeballs. The transformer press has became complete shit but im bringing these back probably some of the only good transformers that were in U.S. Lol and about the smack pills i just want to make a very small batch and have it sent to edata for records showing theres been reported pills with heroin lately i think it would be kool to make a little history. <br />http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=14388<br /><br />And to everyone wondering about my karma its because i have made claims about 5-apb not being mdxx to another member so my karma got raped by him and the people that are on his dick so dont really trust my karma stats were not 12 years old anymore anyways so it should not matter.

				Im going to vegas for vaca this week when i return production will start.<br /><br />Mda/mdma mix pills are my first priority. Honestly these will probably come out before straight mdma pills do.<br /><br />The real og pokes that came out in like 2006 the blue ones were lsd based so it is possible maybe someone who has more insight on lsd can help me but then again where the fuck am i gonna get good liquid lsd? Sure as hell not from S.R. But if anyone remembers when the og pokes were dipped in hash oil? I plan on doing that as well.

				okay, first, i think some of these ideas are totally reckless and irresponsible.&nbsp; if you press a whole mess of pills in bulk and send them out, they&#039;re just going to be passed of as &quot;ecstasy&quot; and nothing else in clubs and at shows across the country.&nbsp; a LOT of people would like to never put heroin in their body at all even if it has a very mild effect on them.&nbsp; not only will you be wasting your money, but you&#039;re also pulling an asshole move that would anger a lot of people and turn them off to ecstasy all together.&nbsp; <br /><br />second, candyflip pills?&nbsp; god dammit, no, don&#039;t, please.&nbsp; some people don&#039;t want a surprise trip when they take a pill for a plethora of reasons, and again, if you sell these in bulk, the dealer 3 steps down from you could be a total idiot and not know or tell people there&#039;s acid in there when he&#039;s selling them....and no one should have to trip when they&#039;re not expecting/wanting to.&nbsp; also, the effects of ecstasy last for a much shorter duration than the effects of LSD.&nbsp; and dealing with an ecstasy comedown when you&#039;re tripping is no fun and possibly dangerous (psychologically).&nbsp; i understand and agree that using one of the 2C drugs can color the roll a nice way, but none of those drugs are even close to the mindfuck of LSD+MDMA<br /><br />third, mescaline?&nbsp; are you kidding?&nbsp; this sounds like something a 17 year old would talk about.&nbsp; to get an ACTIVE dose of mescaline, you&#039;d need to press giant horse sized pills.&nbsp; i could be mistaken, but i don&#039;t think there has ever been pills pressed with real mescaline, i&#039;m pretty sure thats just an urban legend.&nbsp; or a confusion by the idiots 3 steps down from the presser who used mescaline ANALOGUES like 2c-b in their pills.&nbsp; <br /><br />fourth, who ever said ketamine pills is not very thoughtful or well read either.&nbsp; you have to eat like a quarter gram of ketamine to feel an effect, so again, they would be giant horsepills.&nbsp; on top of that, why would you suggest to a presser that they put a hardcore animal tranquilizer in ecstasy pills.&nbsp; let me say, ketamine is probably my favorite drug, and MDMA+ketamine is probably my favorite combo, but putting them together in pills that will be sold one by one to casual users is a terrible idea.&nbsp; these people probably want to stay awake, talk, dance, laugh, etc...if your pills immobilize people and cut them off from the world around them, you&#039;ll have a lot of people talking about how shitty your pills are and how they would punch you in the nuts if they could.<br /><br />caffeine is a good idea, though.&nbsp; and mda/mdma mix is an awesome idea.&nbsp; just please, man, for the safety of the american public, please don&#039;t include any hard shit like coke, meth, heroin or any heavy psychedelics like LSD or ketamine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be a dick here, just concerned about people&#039;s well being.

				I know a movie is not the greatest reference but in Bad Boys 2 the press they used to make the XTC was a large round machine that spun in a circle, How many pills could something like that pump out? and what would be an average cost?

But there gonna be 100-125mg coming out very soon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just noticed this. 100 - 125 mg MDMA per pill? That&#039;s weak man. You should aim to make them 200mg. Triforce, Defqons &amp; White Speakers all have 180 - 200 mg MDMA in them. The Triforce are my favourites, they hit you hardest.<br /><br />Even though they look the part these will be weak in comparison.<br /><br />I&#039;m really interested in the MDA/MDMA 1/1 pills you&#039;ve said you&#039;ll make. But yeah, they need to be stronger&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>if it&#039;s pure M, 100-125 sounds about right. you don&#039;t want ppl that are used to popping two at once taking 400mg at once... could be very bad!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Triforce have 200mg of MDMA in them. They&#039;re super clean too; no come down. So yeah, I still think 100 - 125 isn&#039;t enough. Especially if they&#039;re the same price.<br /><br />I re-sell to friends and I always tell them to only take one because they&#039;re really strong. If people double up then it&#039;s their own fault really. I&#039;ve never took a pill with out reading up on it first.
