				I know this is really long, but I really hope you read the whole thing, if nothing else it&#039;s a pretty interesting trip report haha, although I doubt this was just caused by my trip. I was REALLY hazy for at least the first half of the story so I expect alot of details aren&#039;t exactly right, and I may drone on about some things too long, but I SWEAR this is how everything happened as best as I can remember, as crazy as it my sound. <br /><br />So me and about 5 of my friends were going camping at a spot we call the blue hole outside of our town last night(its a natural pond that&#039;s always got clear blue water). And I was supplying everyone with 25i to make it a little more interesting. They all took 1 and I took 2 (1mg from DudeRugs). I started tripping pretty hard almost immediatly and had a little trouble holding myself together. They kept telling me to stop moaning and I had almost no depth perception when we were climbing a rock formation down the road. A few hours later I was at the peak of my trip and most everyone else was out looking for firewood while I was sitting and staring at the fire and the water and the ground and just enjoying my trip. At this point things got pretty fuzy because of the trip, I felt like I was watching a movie about someone that got the shit beat out of them and is only able to open their eyes every once in a while before they pass out, but somehow I was at a different party at the same location. There were alot of the same people there so it took my tripping brain a long time to figure it out, but there were deffinitely people there that I knew wouldn&#039;t have been able to come. Eventually I noticed that there were different cars parked in the road and towards the end of the night I was able to notice that everyone was wearing different clothes. I was at some kind of &quot;dream&quot; party (I use quotations because I hadn&#039;t went to sleep and was fully awake. I couldn&#039;t have slept with that soon after the 25i if I wanted to). They were herding me around and I was &quot;waking up&quot; in different places around the blue hole. I felt like I wasn&#039;t in controll of my own body; not like I was doing dumb things or stumbling around, but It was like my brain was following what my body was doing after it happened. It felt like I was in some quest line in an RPG or something, just being herded around by people that would only repeat the same things and sometimes a cutscene would kick in and I was just watching myself walk up to the ledge on a spot we call high rock (for obvious reasons). I kept on repeating something about the meaning of life and how to never die, but it never quite made sense. It was like a riddle I was trying to solve by putting the words in the right place. Eventually I solved it (as I was losing control and stepping up to the ledge. It wasn&#039;t scary, I had no intention of jumping off, just standing there. I&#039;m really not even sure how I know that though) and I blacked out for a second or maybe just closed my eyes and I was back at the camp site with everyone and I somehow knew (or maybe wasn&#039;t in controll again) that I just needed to go into the tent and it would be over (or maybe that I would be able to stay forever) so I just kind of fell through the flap but I never hit the ground. There were a few other flashes of me slapping my friend in the face and another friend putting a bandage on my knee and then I was being helped down the road by two more friends to get back to the camp site. At this point I was in complete control again (and alot more clear and not tripping so hard), but I was still at this different party that couldn&#039;t have been the same. my friends started telling me that I was repeating things that I definitely didn&#039;t repeat at the real party and I soon figured out that they weren&#039;t actually my friends (this was when I was clear enough to notice the different clothes, cars, and some of them wouldn&#039;t have been able to come in real life, plus they were just acting weird, even for having been tripping) One of my &quot;friends&quot; started playing an hour long recording of me repeating <br />&quot;drugs are cool and all, but in the end... we all die. Fuck all you guys forever, because in the end we all die... so lets just live forever. But in the end, you just forget to die. Staying alive forever, is all it takes to die.&quot;<br />I can quote it exactly because another friend was typing it as i said it and txted it to everyone that was there as a joke. At this point I tried to call and text my real friends that were at the real party, but all my texts and calls just went to the people at this &quot;dream&quot; party, so I called a friend that I knew wasn&#039;t at either party and told him to tell my real life friend to call me. The &quot;dream&quot; friend&#039;s phone rang. At this point I started to doubt whether or not these really weren&#039;t my real freinds, but later on this morning I went to my friend&#039;s house that was at the party (the one that sent the text about my rambling) and asked him if any of this actually happened. He said that I dissapeared after about 9 PM and he had no idea what I was talking about. His phone didn&#039;t have any record of the txt being sent even though I still had the txt on mine, but I still had the scraped knee and the bandage was still there. <br />A few hours ago it started to occur to me that I&#039;ve had at least parts of this happen to me before. The part where I solved the riddle and was able to &quot;live forever&quot; with them I&#039;ve had at least once over the past 10 or so years. It seams like this time it was more drug centered, but I do remember that there was drugs involved every time. This was the only time that I was actually at the blue hole when it happened (and the first time that I recognized it as the blue hole). In the past it has happened to me while I was in my bed and I wrote it off as some kind of weird dream. (when it happened the first time and I was really young I remember thinking that it was just a dream that everyone has because I supposedly figured out the meaning of life [something about drugs and forgetting to die])<br />I hope you understand that I was freaking out for the majority of the time this was happening so I don&#039;t remember everything, but this is the best I could do to record what happened to me on the weirdest night of my life.<br /><br />I just want to reitterate that there is ABSOLUTELY no way this was any kind of regular dream. I never went to sleep untill the end of it and everything was REAL. I have regular lucid dreams every once in a while and this was completely different.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in what you have to say and will try to answer any questions you may have about the weirdest night of my life.
