				Hey guys.<br />Im off on holiday with my old man and his missus, although for the times im going to be in my hotel room i REALLY want to take my Xbox 360 with me.&nbsp; My only concerns are using it over an open, free network.<br />Do i need to worry when it comes to online gaming or should i be pretty safe?

				There&#039;s definitely a risk, especially if the network is unencrypted. I don&#039;t if communication between your Xbox and Microsoft&#039;s servers is encrypted. You should probably check on Google or an Xbox forum. If that&#039;s not the case, you should only connect if the hotel&#039;s network is encrypted.

So no matter what they say, don&#039;t blindly believe them.

				Thanks for that mate.&nbsp; I wont call them, someone told me yesterday that most hotels use unsecured internet wifi like you get on buses.&nbsp; Fuck that, they also reckon that hotel internet speeds can be really slow, as they seem to be hot-spots for others who want to piggy back on their connection without being detected.<br />Also its a 3 star hotel, apparently the number of stars gets you the quality that goes with it, who knew?&nbsp; :P
