I&#039;ve actually come to associate the smell/taste of it with throwing up, so bad are the memories<br /><br />Tbh I get what you mean bout beer. I get the worst hangovers on beer as well, still its good for a chill or a wind down, just annoying that you gotta drink like 3-4 pints just to get lit.<br /><br />Personally I just stick to the spirits. I hate the taste of wine more than i do the vod but they&#039;re both pretty shit. Vodkas got 20-25% on the old vino though so it gets you where you wanna go quicker. I&#039;ve bust out the wine before for the prelash and end up drinking a whole bottle even before going out and not been too gone. If i did that with the vodka I&#039;d be wavey as fuck.<br /><br />I bought a Sink the Bismarck a few weeks back. Its beer thats like 40%. Cost about 40 quid for the bottle though, but i wanted to try it. One of those will send you places <br /><br />You should try parisienne absinthe.. the real shit. Had it recently.. man, its beyond being drunk. Its got another level to it.

				LMAO kappacino your getting karma, you have made my afternoon bro!<br />Seriously though, i like the wine because i can take my time on it.&nbsp; Like you said, with beer you have to drink 3-4 to even feel anything.&nbsp; As for the abisynth shit im too much of a pussy to even go there.&nbsp; The last thing i need these days is 2 days of Dtoxing and having the shakes at work lol <br /><br />As for the dark rum, do you mean jamaican rum?&nbsp; I used to have a mate who was nearly 7 foot but was proper fat.&nbsp; He could drink a bottle of that shit and still be standing, not hammered but quite happily pissed!<br />I hate those guys who can just drink, and drink, and drink......

				I know a few of those brutes my man.. a fair few indeed.<br /><br />You should head to Eastern europe.. ever since the days of Stalin they&#039;ve been getting pissed like its a fucking day job (cause it may as well be).. They can hold their drink like no other. Yeah the Jamaican rum.. its just the fucking smell of it. I&#039;ve got the same thing with the taste of mdma. So many times I&#039;ve bombed a 250mg thinking it was semi pure shit and it turns out to be the bollocks and I&#039;ve ended up yacking.. that now even the taste is enough to send me back to those days<br /><br />As for the detox... the trick is to just have water in between all your drinks. Most of the hangover is just your body desperately needing to rehydrate anyway, thats why it feels so shit. Its the one hangover cure that actually works, but people dont do it cause who the fuck wants to be drinking water in between drinks? I drink a ridiculous amount of water anyway so its no hassle for me, down a half pint of h2o between every drink and it knocks off a good 80% of the hangover.<br /><br />the rest can be taken down with some greasy food, OJ, deep stretching, and a bj. If you still have a hangover after all that then there&#039;s something wrong with you ;D

				lol mate.<br />I WISH i had the bj option, but yeah the thing about greasy food is right.&nbsp; Recently when it was a bank holiday weekend for the queen celebration us brits got the monday and tuesday off work.&nbsp; I did three bottles of wine.&nbsp; The next day i had a nice fry-up.<br />Eggs, bacon, has-browns, sausage and finally some beans.&nbsp; The hangover was not as bad as i expected later.&nbsp; Although after all that food i couldnt be fucked to move for like 4 hours.&nbsp; Just ended up watching re-runs of Top Gear on dave.<br />Boring as fuck, but at least my hangover was cured.<br />I am just too scared to try other drinks these days bro, too set in my ways.<br />I also find water boring as fuck.&nbsp; I Am willing to drink a couple of pints here and there but once i get stuck into the wine, that is generally it bro.

				Lmao man, true that<br /><br />Dave is honestly my recovery channel.. You know how many times I&#039;ve watched reruns of Man Vs Food on a bitch of a comedown? Fuck I&#039;m in the triple digits it has to be <br /><br />People mock english cuisine.. but the full english just goes to show what I&#039;ve said all along. Brits go HARD. The only reason we don&#039;t have fucking snails or frogs legs, is because we need food that will ease the pain.. and our wives are too busy on their knees. Simple as<br /><br />Recently I&#039;ve been going hard to the point of not even having a discernable sleeping pattern. I basically measure time by what happens to be on TV at the time. If its a week of BBC breakfast and thinking about fucking that milf presenter, you know for a fact ive been on the charlie and I&#039;m hitting the deck at 5pm<br /><br />The funniest thing is is that to get out of the sleep cycle.. I have to go even harder on one of the days, so that I stay up for 36 and finally fall asleep in the evening like a normal person. Aka, &quot;Sunday&quot;<br /><br />I swear to God the jews KNEW<br /><br />
