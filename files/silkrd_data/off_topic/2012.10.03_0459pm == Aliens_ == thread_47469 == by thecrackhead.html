				Hello good people of the internet,<br /><br />This is the only place where I fell that no matter what we say or how fucked up our theories are there will always be someone to share the same thoughts with us.<br /><br />I am 100% sure aliens are out there so this is not the point of the topic. You have to be a bit stupid to believe that we are alone in the universe or believe what they said in Bible, Koran etc (I grew up in a christian family). I&#039;m not an atheist, I do believe in something which fortunately gives me hope and makes me think that there must be something after death. This &quot;something&quot; is God from my point of view (not one of the mainstream ones). No matter what your God means to you, technically speaking he is an alien as he does not live among us.<br /><br />The other day I was wondering why didn&#039;t aliens come in contact with us and I came to the conclusion that they must have overcome this stupidity we live in, urge for attention, money, etc.<br /><br />What if they just don&#039;t have any kind of currency, government, LE what if what we actually consider the top of intelligent life is at the bottom on the evolution line?<br /><br />I would like to hear your thoughts as well.<br /><br />

				Hello there and welcome to the forums.<br />In my opinion, i dont think we will see aliens or make &quot;contact&quot; in our generational life time.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The reasons for my thinking this are quite simply, aliens would simply not be interested in us as a life form or race, or technological power.<br />If an alien race is advanced enough to travel to us, right now there is simply nothing we would have to offer them.&nbsp; We wouldnt even be deemed suitable friendlies, i mean our economic and global status suggests we could be extinct within the next 50 years anyway.<br />Its not going to be like star trek, were we make contact with aliens and we all share technology happily with each other.<br />Our biggest let down as a race has been to expect too much of something.&nbsp; In the same way we expect aliens to have massive ships or whatever as movie culture suggests.<br />Nah, i think it will be disappointing if we ever encounter anything to be consider &quot;alien&quot;.<br />Anyway, on a lighter note you are right, there is the possibility that aliens exist of course.&nbsp; I think of it this way, imagine the billions of people living on this planet and the billions of possibilities and ideas that exist out.&nbsp; Take that and multiply the thought on a universal scale.<br />Taking this into account, what people think of as GOD, aliens and just about anything else as being a reasonable possibility.<br />As for how these probable aliens might live or exist i would dare not think about.

				The Human Race 6 billion years from now might be said to be aliens.<br /><br />Science knows VERY little about what is out there.<br /><br />It does not even know what we are, if we are an accident or some purpose.<br /><br />Aliens must exist, with billions of planets, maybe so many we cannot count them all, there must be other life out there.<br /><br />We Humans may seed other planets in the future.

				About such things I know.<br /><br />And I tell ye these truths....<br /><br />1. It is mathematically inconceivable that there isn&#039;t life elsewhere in the universe. If one believes in an infinite universe alien life exists by definition.<br /><br />2. Given vastness of said universe, we will certainly never encounter evidence of, let alone communicate with alien life.
