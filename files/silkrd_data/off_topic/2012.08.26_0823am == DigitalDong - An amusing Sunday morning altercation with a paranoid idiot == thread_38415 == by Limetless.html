				Yeah just a tad. It just made me laugh really, he wanted small-fry amounts which if you buy precursors direct from a manufacturer you can&#039;t do in little amounts. So if say you wanted Methylamine, that&#039;s not an issue for me to do but the minimum I would do is 25 liters because that&#039;s the minimum I can buy. Apparently that with the fact I am only interested in really doing larger sorts of transactions makes me LE, doesn&#039;t matter that I have about 400 transactions now (I think) and a lot of them are repeat customers. <br /><br />What a tool.&nbsp; :o

				Yeah normally this sort of thing would annoy me but it was just too funny to take seriously so I thought it would be fun to post it for a laugh. Needless to say he&#039;s gone on the suspicious buyers list in the vendor forum too.
