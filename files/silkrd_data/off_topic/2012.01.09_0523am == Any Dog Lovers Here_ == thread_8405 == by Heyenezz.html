				I get high with my dog (I think he&#039;s a cross between a lab and a rottweiler) and talk to him. Since he can&#039;t talk, I talk for him in a funny accent. We&#039;ve had some good conversations while I was baked :)

				My dogs always know when I&#039;m tripping on psychedelics. They get a lot friendlier towards me, and more playful too. Usually they just like playing fetch with me and wrestling each other, but when I&#039;m tripping they want to wrestle with me too. It&#039;s such great fun hanging out with my dogs when I trip. I love them more than I love most humans.

				I once had a golden retriever named Arthur (R.I.P). While I was at school my stepdad got my dog so drunk that he died. I&#039;m still looking for that asshole. If SR had a way to call hits I would totally do one.

				I get teary eyed just looking at my dog...and no, he does not need a bath.&nbsp; The wife rescued him from the dump at 4 weeks old.&nbsp; 2 days before we had decided to wait to get a dog (we were living on&nbsp; a small houseboat)...but ...he is the best thing (other than our child) that has happened to us.&nbsp; I am convinced that we both love the dog so much that we are willing to deal with &quot;our better halves&quot; through thick and thin.
