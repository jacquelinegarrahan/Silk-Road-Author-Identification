				Bitcoin has legit uses, so there&#039;s a good chance an exchange could fight this.

				Interesting article.&nbsp; Good points.&nbsp; But the author clearly is a US citizen who believes that the Americans hold more power than they truly do.&nbsp; Everything he suggest will happen seems to depend on USG being able to take down foreign websites.&nbsp; It is shortsighted in this sense and there are very few exchanged in the US today period.

				This article seems a little short-sighted to me. I highly doubt the value of a bitcoin will ever fall to zero, although it&#039;s possible it may fall extremely low. And as many mentioned in the comments, the US Government does not run/control everything. Sure, they could make it illegal for US corporations to use it and make it very difficult for both average Americans and international companies with some vested interest in the US to use bitcoin. But, that still leaves the rest of the world, AND people in the US who don&#039;t care if it&#039;s against the law to use bitcoins (call them &#039;criminals&#039; if you like).<br /><br />I thought that the best point made in the comments was by someone who said that the only way to truly eliminate bitcoin would be to find a way to stop the miners, as they are the ones who keep the system running.
