				I&#039;m a vendor and I use(d) Onion Image Uploader for my images. I have some of images (about 60 different images) for all my listings on Silkroad that I didn&#039;t even keep backup images for. And now a 404 error appears when visiting any of the 60 images, I&#039;m pretty sure onion image uploader is fucked. What happened to it? http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion<br /><br />My SR profile (see all the dead OIU links on every listing): http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/<br /><br />God damn it. It took me literally hours to take all those images, re size, compress and upload them now I have to do it all again!! And what place should I use for hosting images from now on? I think Imageshack is more reliable than hidden service sites - they suck. Waste hours of my life... :(

				Find someone with a Freedom Hosting invite code (pro tip: I got one by asking on the forum, but I haven&#039;t had an account long enough to earn any invite codes myself, and I don&#039;t know if that person has any more or is willing to part with them so I won&#039;t name names). Then you can upload pics to your own static web site, no PHP, no bullshit. FH is much less likely to get hacked as whole. Actually, Onion Image Uploader is hosted on FH, but the owner ran his own (obviously insecure) PHP code.
