				And here&#039;s why they got busted &quot;They hooked up with buyers in 34 countries and accepted various forms of payment, including cash, Western Union and PayPal transactions, the indictment claims.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not quite sure I believe that. Anyone that is intelligent enough to set up an online drugs market can&#039;t be so dumb as to start accepting fucking western union and paypal transactions? That&#039;s borderline retarded

				Oh, that&#039;s what I get for not reading the article closely. I was starting to get all panicky, but what they did was idiotic. With the anonymity of bitcoin, we should all be safe here. That was a really poor choice by the Farmer&#039;s Market. I&#039;m glad we have the Silk Road admins making good decisions that keep the customers and vendors safe. <br /><br />Although hopefully that line isn&#039;t thrown in by the law enforcement to make users like us feel safe... Remember people, always be totally secure with what you&#039;re doing. The police do know that sites like this exist, and this proves that they will crack down if they choose to. It took them two years to take down the Farmer&#039;s Market, and goodness knows they would love to take us down too.

				It is true they accepted cash and paypal, infact they didn&#039;t even accept bitcoins.<br /><br />Their paypal account was disguised as a web development company, and unfortunately I did use this method twice. Keep in mind this was a private community, registration wasn&#039;t open. (although in the past it was open to anyone)

				BTC is truly anonymous payment, for the moment.<br /><br />If any LEO takes notice of a particular vendor they could begin to track what comes from where and given enough time, have enough evidence to prove to a jury that the vendor received BTC and exchanged it for cash which was deposited XXXXX into XXXX. They DO NOT need to show actual hard facts as enough indicators, with a good law team, will allow them to paint a picture for the jury that is not easily dismissed.<br /><br />Instawallets.com help slow the process. Thinking of it like hacking or even the tor network itself, if you ping your signal around locations then the trace time becomes cumbersome and ultimately a fruitless, expensive endeavor. But as technology increases they will find better ways to track. Cisco recently released a new packet ultra-sophiscated packet sniffer and that tech with enough use and research can lead to further breakthroughs in internet watchdogging. Hopefully SR never stops evolving though.<br /><br />A good way of understanding how the tor network is from a game, Uplink: Hackers Elite by Introversion. Great game, the concept of pinging your signal and the trace can be applied to the tor network as well.

				Here is the government&#039;s press release:<br /><br /><br />Creators and Operators of On-line Narcotics Marketplace on the TOR Network Arrested on First of Its Kind Federal Indictment Charging Drug Trafficking in 34 Countries and 50 States<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br /><br />April 16, 2012<br /><br />LOS ANGELES - Federal, state, and international law enforcement authorities have arrested eight people who all face federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges stemming from their creation and operation of a “secret” on-line narcotics market place – known as the “The Farmer&#039;s Market” – which sold a variety of controlled substances to approximately 3,000 customers in 34 countries and 50 states.<br /><br />This morning, law enforcement authorities in Lelystad, Netherlands, arrested the lead defendant, Marc Willems, at his home. Yesterday, law enforcement officials in Bogota, Colombia, arrested the second defendant, Michael Evron, a United States citizen who lives in Argentina, as he was attempting to leave Colombia. The remaining defendants, Jonathan Colbeck, Brian Colbeck, Ryan Rawls, Jonathan Dugan, George Matzek, and Charles Bigras were arrested at their respective homes in Iowa, Michigan, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, and Florida. <br /><br />The 66-page indictment, which was unsealed today, was the result of “Operation Adam Bomb,” a two-year investigation led by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration&#039;s (DEA) Los Angeles Field Division, with significant assistance by the Netherlands Regional Police Force Flevoland, prosecutors from the International Legal Assistance Center North East Netherlands, United States Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs, the DEA’s country office in Hague, and the United States Postal Service. The arrests of the defendants took place due to the cooperation and assistance of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, the Colombian Central Directorate of the Judicial Police and Intelligence, Migracion Colombia, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Federal/State/Local authorities in New York, Iowa, Georgia, Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey. <br /><br />“Illegal narcotics trafficking now reaches every corner of our world, including our home computers,” said United States Attorney André Birotte Jr., whose office is handling the prosecution of the case. “But the reach of the law is just as long, and the Department of Justice will work with its partners, both nationally and internationally, to bring narcotics traffickers to justice, wherever they may hide. Working together, we want to make the Internet a safe and secure marketplace by rooting out and prosecuting those persons who seek to illegally pervert and exploit that market.” <br /><br />“The drug trafficking organization targeted in Operation Adam Bomb was distributing dangerous and addictive drugs to every corner of the world, and trying to hide their activities through the use of advanced anonymizing on-line technology,” said Briane M. Grey, DEA Acting Special Agent in Charge. “Today&#039;s action should send a clear message to organizations that are using technology to conduct criminal activity that the DEA and our law enforcement partners will track them down and bring them to justice.”<br /><br />The 12-count indictment charges that each of the defendants was a member of a conspiracy to distribute a variety of controlled substances world-wide through the use of on-line marketplaces that allowed independent sources of supply to anonymously advertise illegal drugs for sale to the public. According to the indictment, the operators of the on-line marketplaces provided a controlled substances storefront, order forms, on-line forums, customer service, and payment methods for the different sources of supply. For customers, the operators screened all sources of supply and guaranteed delivery of the illegal drugs. The on-line marketplaces handled all communications between the sources of supply and customers. For these services, the operators charged a commission based upon the value of the order. Customers of the on-line marketplaces have been identified in every one of the states of the United States and the District of Columbia and in approximately 34 other countries. There are thousands of registered users of the on-line marketplaces. The on-line marketplaces have multiple sources of supply offering various controlled substances, including LSD, MDMA (ecstasy), fentanyl, mescaline, ketamine, DMT, and high-end marijuana. Between January 2007 and October 2009 alone, defendants Willems and Evron processed approximately 5,256 on-line orders for controlled substances valued at approximately $1,041,244 via the on-line controlled substances marketplaces.<br /><br />As alleged in the indictment, the Farmers Market, previously known as Adamflowers, operated on the TOR network. According to the indictment, TOR is a circuit of encrypted connections through relays on the TOR network that can be downloaded on home computers. TOR allows websites and electronic mail communications to completely mask IP address information by spreading communications over a series of computers, or relays, located throughout the world. The on-line marketplaces have accepted Western Union, Pecunix, PayPal, I-Golder, and cash as payment for illegal drug sales. <br /><br />According to investigators, this drug trafficking organization (“DTO”) attempted to operate online in secrecy, utilizing the TOR network, IP anonymizers, and covert currency transactions; but investigators were able to infiltrate the DTO and its technology during the course of the investigation.<br /><br />Those arrested were:<br /><br />Marc Willems, 42, a Dutch citizen living in Lelystad, Netherlands<br /><br />Michael Evron, 42, a United States citizen living in Buenos Aires, Argentina<br /><br />Jonathan Colbeck, 51, of Urbana, Iowa<br /><br />Brian Colbeck, 47, of Coldwater, Michigan<br /><br />Ryan Rawls, 31, of Alpharetta, Georgia<br /><br />Jonathan Dugan, 27, of North Babylon, New York<br /><br />George Matzek, 20, of Secaucus, New Jersey<br /><br />Charles Bigras, 37, of Melbourne, Florida<br /><br />An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in court.<br /><br />Each of the defendants is charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life, and money laundering conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. Defendants Willems, Evron, Jonathan Colbeck, Brian Colbeck, and Rawls are also charged with the distribution of LSD, which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life. Finally, defendants Willems and Evron are charged with participating in a continuing criminal enterprise, which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence.<br /><br />In addition to those named in the indictment, authorities arrested 7 other people this morning (2 in Netherlands, 1 in Atlanta, 2 in New Hampshire, 1 in Pennsylvania, and 1 in New Jersey). During the course of the arrests made in this case, federal agents and local law enforcement officers also seized substances identified as hashish, LSD and MDMA, as well as an indoor psychotropic mushroom grow, and 3 indoor marijuana grows.<br /><br />Release No. 12-045<br /><br />

				From the indictment:<br /><br />&quot;The online marketplaces have accepted Western Union, Pecunix, PayPal, I-Golder, and cash as payment for illegal drug sales.&nbsp; Customers who paid in cash for their orders sent the cash to addresses controlled by a co-conspirator.&nbsp; The co-conspirator then collected the cash and forwarded the cash, minus a commission, to the operators via Western Union or other means.&nbsp; The organization referred to the addresses used to accept this cash payments or individuals who accepted these cash payments as &quot;cash drops.&quot;&quot;

				TFM being shut down comes as a surprise to absolutely nobody who knew about it and had any common sense, you can&#039;t have a near open registration major international drug market and take CIM and paypal. Even they knew that their entire security came from not having feds on the forum, as they made apparent in several posts that worried that their multi thousand member forum might one day be infiltrated (like it hadn&#039;t already been). They were extremely naive. Unfortunately many on SR are also extremely naive. Also bitcoin is no more anonymous than paypal if you use paypal to pay for it. Bitcoin is no more anonymous than the method used to obtain it, don&#039;t be fooled by adding an extra layer because it is by itself a worthless layer, the entire transaction history is public. Bitcoins should be obtained anonymously and cashed out anonymously, at the least you should use a mix but then you risk money laundering charges unless you cash in and out anonymously. I am quite afraid that Bitcoins falsely perceived anonymity is lulling people here into a false sense of security.

				Guys,<br /><br />Chill out! TFM was busted pretty much before they started. Hushmail handed over the emails, which contained personal information about the vendors, non-encrypted. They accepted forms of payment that have been KNOWN to be dangerous for the online drug community. Cash in the mail, paypal? <br /><br />They might be TRYING to bust the customers now, but the fact is that they would have busted the customers already if this was an &#039;ongoing operation&#039;.<br /><br />Silk Road was being created while every other board was making these mistakes. SR admin has already watched a couple boards fall, and I&#039;m willing to bet he has taken into account the mistakes that were made along the way. <br /><br />TFPM never gave a damn about encryption. PGP is encouraged on this website. For some vendors, it is damn manditory. All the government has done here was a few subpoenas. They haven&#039;t done anything special with technology, no breakthrough tor cracking, no super bitcoin exposing. NOTHING. <br /><br />If they could break tor, they would be able to bust a LOT more than just the TFPM customers. Think of all of the other boards with *MUCH* worse content on them. <br /><br />As long as the SR admin has kept his friends tightly knitted, everything else will stand ON ITS OWN. Just give it some thought. Everything is fine here on Silk Road.

				Even if SR isn&#039;t taken down, which I find the least likely of all these scenarios, vendors will be targeted.<br /><br />We will inevitably lose valued members of this community and every effort at further communication and techniques should be discussed discreetly. <br /><br />Openly relaying valued techniques that are in practice should be avoided, even if you are just guessing or talking out your ass, you never know what shipping method you have unwittingly exposed. Because of this I will be scrubbing my posts of shipping methods, only the gov&#039;ts actual shipping methods and methods of detection. <br /><br />The posts which contain the most of valuable vendor information NEED TO BE REMOVED from the PUBLIC eye. Say I post some procedures from place I worked and it is helpful but also gives tips to vendors. This post should be stickied into a vendor only forum.<br /><br />One VERY SECURE way to do this is to use two installs on separate servers for public and vendors. At least on invisionboard and PHPVB, you can link separate installs together in certain ways that allow the public forum mods to have access to what categories are in the vendors section, but not the vendor section itself (mods could be LEO as well, sorry). <br /><br />This way they can move appropriate pages to where it will help people, it will appear to be one installation and with proper editing, even the forum vendors can retain access in-between forums on the same login. (though that would open the possibility to be backdoored through the public forum so separate log-ins makes the most security sense)<br />

				Yeah the panicking is probably unnecessary. If LE had magically cracked Tor, they wouldn&#039;t be going after small time drug dealers; they&#039;d be going out after the hardcore child porn sites that exist on Tor and are causing real harm. I mean seriously, every part of the budget going towards arresting non-harmful drug vendors should be going towards taking down child porn users. Once again, the priorities in this country astound me. They went after TFM because it was an easy fish to catch, and they knew that it would scare users of similar sites. Don&#039;t buy into their fear. SR is as secure as it&#039;s always been. One badly run site being shut down doesn&#039;t change a thing.

				Vendors are already targeted, man. LEO has been scraping silk road for awhile, probably since the first major news article about it? <br /><br />Check it out though, they busted the vendors of TFM, but the site is still up. The store is still running. They couldn&#039;t shut the site down. All they did was find the vendors old email addresses (hushmail). Subpoena to hushmail. Hushmail handed the emails over. They found *UNENCRYPTED* personal information, and probably the addresses of more vendors. More subpoenas. Subpoenas can take months to clear. <br /><br />That&#039;s all they could do. They couldn&#039;t get access to the servers for the .onion addresses. The only way they had in, was through hushmail. and because they didn&#039;t use PGP or some other form of encryption, they had all the information they needed right there. <br /><br />The rest of the information was pretty much available right on the TFM forum. The cash drop address was in the public eye, under a certain company name. Subpoena to get the company owner&#039;s information.. done. Find the paypal address that is accepting the money for orders.. Subpoena paypal. Done. <br /><br />Now throw Silk Road in the mix. No centralized payment collection. Tor. PGP for addresses and 90% of private messages. Bitcoin. AKA .. LEO&#039;s worst nightmare right now. They are trying to scare us, but the fact is they are more afraid of us, because we are anonymous. We are winning.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have an identity in this world, you are law enforcement&#039;s fucking nightmare.

				It really isn&#039;t better training etc though, they have done money mule / paypal tracing operations many times in the past. TFM was operating with techniques that were known as weak to federal level attackers, and they kept using them because they thought they could screen the feds out of their 3k member once open registration forum.<br /><br />http://www.scrippsnews.com/content/project-flicker-investigation-exposes-vast-child-pornography-ring<br /><br />www.dodig.mil/fo/Foia/ERR/OperationFlicker/200800080D%20(black).pdf<br /><br />Somewhere there is a big report on how they detangled the paypal and money mule network to trace the people running those commercial membership CP sites (they were using fake work at home ads to recruit money mules), but I can not be bothered to dig around for it right now. But I am sure they used the exact same techniques against farmers market, since farmers market was using the same exact technique as the CP sellers in this operation.

TFM was operating with techniques that were known as weak to federal level attackers, and they kept using them because they thought they could screen the feds out of their 3k member once open registration forum.<br /><br />http://www.scrippsnews.com/content/project-flicker-investigation-exposes-vast-child-pornography-ring<br /><br />www.dodig.mil/fo/Foia/ERR/OperationFlicker/200800080D%20(black).pdf<br /><br />Somewhere there is a big report on how they detangled the paypal and money mule network to trace the people running those commercial membership CP sites (they were using fake work at home ads to recruit money mules), but I can not be bothered to dig around for it right now. But I am sure they used the exact same techniques against farmers market, since farmers market was using the same exact technique as the CP sellers in this operation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I remember reading a local article about a man in a nearby state who was arrested for receiving a package with a large amount of crack/cocaine in it and he pleaded that he only answered a post of craigslist for quick cash. He wasn&#039;t told what was in the box and was only told they needed an urgent package picked up while they were busy handling their business, discretion was obviously stated. I don&#039;t remember what he said but I think it was like the guy who hired him didn&#039;t want some &quot;sensitive&quot; paperwork to reach his family so he sent it somewhere else.<br /><br />SR is secure, yes. But the people need to take precautions, telling everyone not to worry may lead to an influx of new buyers reading the posts and seeing that everything is ok, no need to dilly dally with PGP and temp wallets. Not saying you meant that, but I always play devil&#039;s advocate.

				This is crazy, because I remember one night about 2 or 3 in the morning of April 1st (April Fools day) there were a lot of funny posts all over SR and people were acting like the site had LE&#039;s on it for sure, but the next day everything was back to normal and I just took all the subtle hints as I was high and reading into things way too much.<br /><br />Anyone remember that night and all those posts and a lot of people on the forum acting real different and dropping hints about the site being watched in their posts?<br /><br />I know I couldn&#039;t of made that up in my head especially after reading this!

				Well, I don&#039;t know where he got this information... but looking at the indictment,&nbsp; this information checks out.<br /><br />We know &quot;thecloser29&quot;&nbsp; was a dealer from the New York area (based on his claims both here on SR as a &quot;NYC&quot; dealer, as well as on Topix.com where there were multiple threads talking about him residing in the New York area), and the indictment details (on page 21/ 66) , that Dugan received 125 hits of LSD at an address on Garnet St in North Babylon, NY.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is just circumstantial, but it backs up what has been claimed.

				&nbsp;I would believe this claim....&nbsp; Also, based on the fact that Dugan was arrested over the farmer&#039;s market bust, then the chances are that he is NOT a confidential information, but rather just a dealer who was careless.<br /><br />Thus, the security risk is lower than if he is a C.I.&nbsp; , but this possibility that he is a C.I. or has &#039;turned&#039; cannot be excluded at this point.<br /><br />So in terms of security, the next step is for S.R. to completely terminate the account of thecloser29 and all associated data.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only time will tell the actual implications beyond what we know now.

				There was no secret informant. Adam used Hushmail, so every single email he ever sent was stored and readable by the Feds.<br />That&#039;s all they need to get all his paypal cashier and WU information. Then just make a buy for a bunch of LSD using all the &quot;private&quot; emails in Adams hushmail account where he told everybody the new store address and presto place is busted, but that&#039;s just icing on the cake they already had him for conspiracy with plenty of documentation and history. Not like Adam didn&#039;t still hand out a menu to everybody who contacted him from Onlinepot.org either.. any keystone cops could&#039;ve brought down TFM.<br /><br />He gift wrapped evidence to the DEA by not using his own PGP encryption. They have all his emails from 2007 - now.

They already had every single email Adam wrote from 2007-Now which gave them a detailed overview of his entire operation. They had his paypal cashiers which were sending wires to him they could follow. Don&#039;t really need secret informants when security is so terrible. He was the low hanging fruit on the hidden wiki list of drug sites, had public clearnet ads since 2003, only a matter of time I&#039;d say unfortunately.<br /><br />Here, they could use informants. Maybe they bust somebody who claims to know whoever runs this place and use him to milk information. Only way this place will ever get busted. Weren&#039;t they hiring database admins a few months ago here? How many agents applied for the job

				He&#039;s probably not LE, just an idiot drug dealer and occasional scammer.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a small chance he was an informant during the past few months -- but that risk is pretty low considering his behavior, and the fact that no one was arrested from his shipments.&nbsp; &nbsp;Likely he was under surveillance pending the bust for his involvement with TFM (assuming the claims are correct and he is the same guy).&nbsp; If this is true...&nbsp; &nbsp; Now the risk is that now he &#039;turns&#039; -- becomes an informant and cooperates with LE in order to try to bring down SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This would probably involve posing as a buyer or seller (or both) on SR, meaning they could target both buyers and sellers.<br /><br />I&#039;d be especially wary of new vendors at this point, as well as buyers that want to purchase any significant amount of &#039;quantity&#039; of schedule I substances.&nbsp; Anyone who had involvement with thecloser29 should &#039;clean house&#039; , both physically and electronically.

				yea i knew she was gay...well actually I assumed she was.. I love that marsha was sucking black cock for coke..TRUE story..awesome..<br /><br />And you sir MUST have read my post in MY threads.. but you didn&#039;t pay attention. That is an act. like ric flair to get attention. It worked and it rubbed some people(i guess your one of them... though I don&#039;t know why anyone would care) the wrong way.<br /><br />The &quot;KING&quot; that post in MY threads is a lot different then this one. See my reviews so far. But this is not about me. I just responded so you would be clear.<br /><br />And I 100% disagree that after a raid &quot;us&quot; meaning Sr or ANY drug dealer or buyer should be more cautious. When a plane crashes should you then worry about yours crashing? Some people actually do. And those are the same people that watch there package for a day before they pick it up.<br /><br />I thought these forums were to debate and comment. You gave yours and I gave mine. I never addressed a single person. I never called any 1 person out.&nbsp; I simply stated that this kind of shit needs to stop in here. Again my opinion. I know almost every senior member or higher believes there opinion matter&#039;s more then us newbs and you are entitled to believe that if you want . Clearly not all think that.<br /><br />So I apologize to you if you think I&nbsp; believe&quot; I run shit around here&quot; I know I don&#039;t. I only act like that in MY threads..

				Having spent the last 8 hours reading this thread, reading the 66 page indictment, all the topix posts by thecloser29 and a bunch of news articles on TFM, it doesn&#039;t make sense that TheCloser29 is Jonathan Dugan. Although they are both from NY and deal drugs online, there are some major differences I noticed. TheCloser seems like a petty junky/scammer dealing in H, roxis and opana and other downers without ever mentioning LSD or MDMA. Dugan only supplied a MDMA and LSD (I believe) through TFM. Not to mention Dugan pulled off his online dealing for years while TheCloser is obviously a compulsive liar/manipulator that couldn&#039;t keep his business straight for more than a couple months at best - being called a scammer all over the internet, not just here on the road.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whatever.

				that looney chris from onlinepot.org claims on his site the best lawyer for beating drug charges is waiting for him to arrive which is good seeing how chris charged adam something like $500 a year plus free drugs every month to advertise since 2006 on his crazy man page covered in so many links and ads you can&#039;t find any content.<br /><br />surprised nothing happened to chris surely there must be endless records of him receiving hash and weed in the mail once they cracked the hushmail account. guess it doesn&#039;t matter as he&#039;s a med patient.

				I don&#039;t think LE will be able to do anything SR for a long while and won&#039;t after this.<br />Since they &quot;busted&quot; the guys involved with the Farmers market it makes it look like they are actually doing something to stop online drug trading, calming down those who are so fired up about it and then just going to drop the SR thing for a while since they really can&#039;t do much to stop this site.

				Yeah........and that&#039;s reason to not be as ever vigilant about our security why? It&#039;s like the Rise and Fall of Rome, we must always be a few steps ahead of whatever the worst that could happen, or else we all fall. It&#039;s way too easy to buy from compromised vendors, it&#039;s way too easy to for a vendor to get busted and give up all shipping addresses as collateral, it&#039;s way too easy for them use a poker in mail to hopefully puncture an airtight and see if K9 detects anything. Absolutely never let your guard down, and keep innovating.
