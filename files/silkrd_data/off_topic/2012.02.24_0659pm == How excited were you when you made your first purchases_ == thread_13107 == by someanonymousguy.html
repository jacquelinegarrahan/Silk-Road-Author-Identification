				I&#039;ve been browsing SR for about a year. I had an old account, but I accidentally clicked a phishing link, so made a new one! Now that I&#039;m considering purchasing I&#039;m both excited and very nervous. How did you feel? I imagine receiving that first package is a bit of fun!

				Very exited at first. Then I took a hit of the acid, after 10 minutes decided it was either fake or really weak. So I took the rest at once (themunchies&#039;s 10 hit WoW acid). After about 45 minutes I was having the most intense acid trip ever. Pretty cool since it was my first time. I didn&#039;t freak out or anything, just smoked some spice and basked in the euphoria

				Getting the first package filled me more with disbelief than any thing else. It was the second package, the one that showed my original results were reproducible that made me giddy.

				I was ecstatic. The first thing I said was &quot;The system works!&quot; LSD from Streetpharm, I still have the envelope on my wall. <br /><br />Having SR to get Acid is amazing. I can live without every drug or find it IRL except for tabs. Something magical about LSD and having a steady source for it makes me happy every day&nbsp; :)

				Holy shit, you&#039;ve been on the Silk Road for a YEAR and haven&#039;t made a purchase yet? I&#039;ve been a member since about August 2011 I think, but I made my account and made my first purchase within 1 month! I was SSSSOOOOOOOO excited, I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect, but it went flawlessly and made a believer out of me! :D<br /><br />It was 1g of meth from VortexMilkMan, and it was probably the best meth I ever smoked. I mean it was good quality, but mostly it was just such a good feeling to have &quot;beaten The Man&quot;, lol!

				My first purchase was an 1/8 of Alaskan Thunderfuck from 420meds. Opening up that package and finding a triple vacuum sealed baggie of bud from halfway across the country felt like something out of the future.<br /><br />I love this place ;).

				I couldn&#039;t believe it when my package showed up. And it was so professional, it really paid off to do some research before ordering. My mind was consumed with the implications of SR for weeks. What&#039;s almost harder to believe is that the novelty of this place has worn off. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I totally dig it, but it just doesn&#039;t seem out of the ordinary anymore. Funny how you can grow accustomed to something that would have damn near anyone shitting their pants in disbelief if you showed it to them...

				My very first purchase was a gram of MDMA from Ivory. I did all the research possible and it sounded legit, but of course you&#039;re never really sure until it comes in. I checked my mailbox every day for a week, even when it was obvious that it couldn&#039;t have come yet, and I kept convincing myself that the whole site was a scam and I had just waste my money. Then one day, I opened my mailbox and saw a letter from Ivory&#039;s country of origin. I immediately knew what it was. If you had seen my face, you&#039;d have assumed that I had just won the lottery. I ran to my bedroom, opened the mail, and pulled out the most beautiful MDMA I had ever seen. I immediately went back on SR and made my second purchase, this one for a half ounce of shrooms from Rocker. That one came through in less than a week, and I knew that I had found paradise. But yeah, nothing can beat that first successful purchase euphoria. It&#039;s just such a stunning revelation that the system actually works.

				Ahhh, I remember my first time, the birds were singing, the sun was shining...<br /><br />Unfortunately, it really wasn&#039;t - but it was still amazing! I got 7g off MJMuse and I paid for express so knew roughly when to expect it - it was really scary and I knew I wouldn&#039;t be able to be there when it arrived. But when I got home and it was there it was amazing. I was so excited.<br /><br />And I agree about the disbelief, it does seem a little surreal some times. Like so often I&#039;d be dry and think &quot;god i really wish there was just a website that I can order from...&quot;<br /><br />I also agree about the acid - can&#039;t wait to try mine for the first time :) would never have found it IRL.

				My first order was an RC so I didn&#039;t really freak out over the legality, I wasnt even worried that it would get intercepted. My only real issue was wondering how long it would take to get here and I worried about purity.<br /><br />The only time I ever really got scared or nervous was the time I ordered MDMA from abroad. This was just a week or so back during the customs crackdown, I was SURE that it would get intercepted, I didn&#039;t think that I&#039;d get raided but I didn&#039;t want my address to be flagged (as I often order other expensive things that are legal to own but not legal to import&nbsp; ;) ).<br />However it all worked out.<br /><br />I&#039;m still in disbelief and a little worried that the road will eventually close down and then I&#039;ll just be SOL for RCs.
