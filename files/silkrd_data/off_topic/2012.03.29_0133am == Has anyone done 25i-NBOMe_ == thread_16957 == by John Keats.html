				sorry but that is a douchebag move man. <br /><br />it doesnt relate to lsd in the slightest except that you get visuals, so yeah unsuspecting college kids would be great &quot;targets&quot; but that is just asking for bad things to happen to you. (karma wise)<br /><br />my advice is dont buy 25i and sell it off as lsd, but you will do what you want.

Does 25i give you the brain drain the next day? Syneasthesia at high doses? Etc etc

				I can&#039;t speak for everyone, but one of the main reasons I come here is to escape from the assholes on the street who try to push bunk products on me and rip me off. I&#039;d like to think and certainly hope that nobody here will assist you in taking advantage of unsuspecting customers.

				Definitely a really stupid move. You&#039;re just contributing to the type of bullshit that ruins drugs and drug culture. Why be a dickless pussy when you can actually try to sell decent, honest product?

Switch from Keats to Mad Magazine, should be more up your alley! <br /><br />And dude... Why not buy the Boom... and don&#039;t let me get too drastic here... Sell it as Boom? <br />Try some yourself first, then you can accurately and assuredly inform your potential clientelle, it&#039;s drug dealing 101 and it&#039;s the first step in getting respect from your buyers.

				I think Jim is right.&nbsp; Why not just sell the stuff as what it is, if it&#039;s any good then your college kid customers will probably pay decent money for it anyway.

				Ahh don&#039;t sell 25i as LSD, like yea itd be easier to move, but thats fucked- 25i is a cool as drug all on its own, just doesnt have the name recognition- don&#039;t fuck around switchin it on people (also if you notice just about every 25i dealer on here has a note on their profile about not selling it as acid)<br /><br />I LOVE 25i, but like its not as heavy of a load as LSD.&nbsp; I took a tab and half of 25i, hit the club, had a fucking blast, held intelligent convos not like the spacey convos I normally have on acid- I just felt groovey the lights looked awesome, but it wasn&#039;t super trippy- Like I couldve taken more but like I was just super content with life-&nbsp; Just be smart man and dont dick people
