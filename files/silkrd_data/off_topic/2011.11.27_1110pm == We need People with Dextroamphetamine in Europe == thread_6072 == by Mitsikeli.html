				So adderall/dexedrine and vyvanse are really difficult to buy found on Europe. But Dextroamphetamine is being sold with prescription in some countries. I think United kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium. Possible more than those. Maybe with another name too. <br /><br />So just creating this in case anyone have a prescription here or would like to get one. I think there are many customers from EU that would like those pills...<br /><br />Just found that Netherlands has dextroamphetamine too. So come on guys. Some should find some!

				It is out there, although I&#039;ve not found a reputable seller with prices which tempt me. I am the person in that subject header as I have hundreds of legit UK dexamphetamine (manf : Auden McKenzie) but setting up a SR selling account is too complicated and I am too lazy. Also I have loads of 5mg zolpidem, again genuine UK script stuff, which is also a&nbsp; rarity over here.<br /><br />Also pharm speed is only going to get pricier the way things are going with the shortage problems in the US.&nbsp; :(

				To be honest I&#039;m still a little paranoid about the idea of selling on SR and heard seller accounts are expensive, but I will look into it. <br /><br />Would it be rulebreaking to post a photo just to prove I&#039;m not bullshitting?

				Decided it&#039;s just too impractical to get into selling proper on SR, though am considering other ways of getting them on SR ie may trade with willing UK seller with pharm opies. May take a while. Photo, just so you know I&#039;m not bullshitting -<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=66692da13b8d1e54c1f0d14caec92c47.jpg
