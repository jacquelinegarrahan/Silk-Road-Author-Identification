				Tho&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Learn more about&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Drug Tests&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; How does the testing?<br />How does the testing?<br />Pills<br />Pills For we have a recognition system . On the basis of the appearance of a pill (including diameter, thickness, color and logo) and an acid test to see whether the pill prevents the recognition list. This list includes pills in the past period several times in the laboratory were analyzed. The list is updated weekly. If your pill on this list, you get to hear the results. That is to say, which substance (s) is in it, and how much. If the pill is not recognized, you can use the pill to be sent to the laboratory.<br /><br />Powders, capsules and liquids<br />In order to determine exactly which substances are present in it and in what quantities, these drugs always forwarded to the laboratory. For powders and capsules there is an immediate acid test is done to get an indication to what means it goes. Of powders, we have a little less than 1/10 gram (80 mg) are required for analysis in the laboratory.<br /><br />The results<br />after a week you can call for the results. You get the full laboratory results. For some drugs (GHB and LSD) takes longer (2 to 4 weeks).<br /><br />Conditions for testing<br />at the test and recreational drugs information center will also give details about the various (entertainment) drugs. <br />You can get tested resources such as ecstasy, cocaine, speed, GHB, LSD. The following resources can not be tested: mushrooms, drugs, hashish and marijuana, steroids and raw materials for drugs.<br /><br />We test only for consumers. We did not test for dealers, parents or police.<br />You remain anonymous, we note only information about means, not about individuals.<br />You may up to three times per drug samples tested.<br />For powders, a maximum of 1 g and 10 ml for liquids. If you exceed the above quantities with you, we test not for you.<br />We test any ingredients that can be used for drug production.<br />The test result can not legally binding.<br />The tester, the participating organization and the laboratory can not be held liable for the consequences of the use of any drug.<br /><br />Self-testing<br />in smart shops and via the Internet, self-testing (eg EZ Test and Dope Test on sale). In these tests, it is a color test, based on the Marquis-test. It is not possible on the basis of this test a reliable judgment on the contents of a pill. The color reaction is merely an indication of the content and gives no information about the amount of a substance. <br />The great danger of a self-test is that the test has a false appearance of certainty can give.<br /><br />Pills that higher amounts of substances to give a self often confusing or misleading results. This danger exists especially with pills next to a XTC-like substance (MDMA, MDEA, MDA) another undesirable substance. Examples of such substances from the past, strychnine (rat poison) and PMA.<br /><br />The only way to the actual content of a pill to find out, it is tested at an official testing services on this site. These testing services also use the Marquis test, but only as an indication. In a testing service allows you to get complete results on the contents of a pill (or another drug).<br /><br />Test Service Drug<br />Drug use is not without risks. You can see on the outside can not see what a drug is and what strength. Addicts Northern Netherlands has a testing and information point. Users of recreational drugs, these resources (both pills, powders and liquids) tested. In the Netherlands there are several places a testing service or a drop-off point. At a collection point you never get directly the result because all resources are redirected to the laboratory.<br /><br /><br /><br />Test Service Groningen <br />Addicts Northern Netherlands (tho)<br />Leonard Springer Road 27 (opposite Martiniplaza) <br />9727 KB Groningen Hours : Every Thursday from 14.00 to 16.00.

Now that the &quot;&quot; Gebruikersruimtes &quot;&quot; have put the dealers out of business and the junky&#039;s don&#039;t have to steal anymore. There was a population of 80 percent drug related crime inhabitants in the jails. We have now 20% emptyness in our jails. It was stupid at first to give OR heroin OR methadone. Now it has changed in AND heroin AND methadone, everybody is happy. The police is, the junky&#039;s are and the community is. Because the junky&#039;s are out of site of the streets. The junky&#039;s don&#039;t have to spend time in their fix and they can go three times a day to the &quot;&quot; Gebruikersruimte &quot;&quot; ( copy that word and look in google picture search ) <br /><br />This is a place where we can smoke;<br />http://www.rug.nl/fwn/informatievoor/scholieren/betasteunpunt/gebruikersonderzoek<br />This is where they can shoot<br />http://www.omroepwest.nl/nieuws/haagse-gebruikersruimte-mag-ook-avond-en-weekend-open<br />(the small picture in the middle)<br /><br />Every big town has such a place.<br />If the users can get their supply for free, it is hard to find a dealer.<br />There is no market anymore.<br />But it&#039;s only for the heroin users, for now.<br />They were the most expensive and kept 80% of the jails full.<br />And it is a expensive road to come in prison for your government.<br />So it is not to please us as users of the substance but in the interest of the citizens.<br />No every party who wants to stop this project, will send those users right back on the streets where they start stealing again and give the inner city&#039;s a bad name, and people start to feel insecure and plain scared.<br />Now they are out of sight, smoking their dope.<br />We the Dutch have the lowest figure of heroin addiction in Europe.<br />Drug related crimes are plummeted, now the heroin supply is regulated.<br /><br />Free heroin from the government in addition to your methadone maintenance supply.<br /><br />Fucking utopia with a capital U, UTOPIA!

It is already mixed with caffeine to make it run better.<br />&nbsp;It&#039;s very good stuff, and if you want a higher dose, that is always possible.<br />&nbsp;You may take what your body is up against. You may not fall asleep. And if a shooter is not able to get the needle out and passes out before he can do that, then the dose is lowered for safety reasons. Those dealers and junky&#039;s that you saw in Adam are gone. Very hard to find. They are all of the streets. No market anymore and so new wannabee junky&#039;s have no opportunity anymore to get hooked. We were already the country with the lowest addiction rate, but now the junky who are there are going to die out and no new ones can fill their places. For a few years back we had our prisons full and often there were 2 persons in one cell. No the policy is changed and the heroin is given for free, the junky&#039;s don&#039;t have to commit crimes. And the dealers can&#039;t be put to jail also. Result is that our prisons are for over 20% empty right now.Everybody benefits.<br />&nbsp;Not only the public, because the whole scene is out of sight and gone. But junky&#039;s have mony to spend because they can not spend it on the dope anymore. They get a better health. The time that went to score is now used for a proper meal etc.<br />Damn what a explanation!
