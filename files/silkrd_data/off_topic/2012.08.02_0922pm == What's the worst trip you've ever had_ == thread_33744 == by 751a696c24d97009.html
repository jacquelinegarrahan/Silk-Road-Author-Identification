				Figured this could be an interesting thread. I&#039;ve always been able to get something out of my bad trips, regardless of how terrifying they may be at first. In fact, I&#039;ve gotten more out of my bad trips than I have my good ones. Still don&#039;t like them, but they do make for some interesting stories.<br /><br />So, let&#039;s hear the story of your worst trip. What did you take? How much? What, if anything, caused it? What happened during and after the trip?<br /><br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s mine:<br /><br />I was a young, and more importantly stupid, drug user who was interested in trying shrooms. I wanted to try a low dose for my first time, and I had looked up doses for wet shrooms and decided to take about 15 grams to have a nice, easy first trip. No visuals, hardly even a body high.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I took dry shrooms. Didn&#039;t know the difference because I had never done them before. I figured dry shrooms were crushed up powder. I also took them alone.<br /><br />For the first 45 minutes or so, I was a little uncomfortable, and I assumed I was peaking around this time because I was under the assumption that I had taken a very small dose. I decided to check out Erowid and see how long a trip usually lasted. At this point, typing was difficult and my computer was, as I recall, evil.<br /><br />So naturally, as I always do, I got distracted and started looking at pictures of shrooms to compare them to mine. I clicked on a picture of an eighth of dry shrooms and realized that they looked very similar to mine, just a much smaller amount. I searched and found a picture of wet shrooms and then realized my terrible error.<br /><br />I started panicking and decided to call a friend to have him come over and watch me, but when I tried to dial his number, the phone began to make these loud, echoing, ambient sounds that reminded me of a dragon. I was still able to realize that my phone wasn&#039;t a dragon and I was aware that I was just experiencing the effects of the shrooms, so I continued to try to dial his number. Finally, I dialed it in correctly and called him.<br /><br />The phone rang for several hours (not really, but I was convinced it did at the time) and went to voicemail. When I heard his voice, I felt myself being swallowed into darkness, with my room fading into nothingness. I felt as if I had fallen into a pool and was now sinking into Eternity and Oblivion. I remember falling for hours and screaming, but nothing came out of my mouth. This continued for what felt like hours and I remember feeling a sense of dread, doom, and coldness the entire time.<br /><br />I eventually started to come down, and I felt as if I was coming out of a dense fog into clean, crisp air. I was on the floor and my phone was on top of one of the blades of my ceiling fan. When I had sobered up, I took my phone and called my friend to ask him to come over because I was shaken by the event and needed someone to talk to. He answered, and he said that I had called him several times during the trip and called him a dragon. He said that I threatened to cut off his dragon head with my fan of phone-hero-justice. I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s why my phone was on my ceiling fan. I have no recollection of this, but my recent calls history shows that I did call him.<br /><br />This trip turned me off from shrooms for a while, but now I feel much more comfortable whenever I start to have a bad trip. I remind myself that I am in control and that it will end. I&#039;m actually glad I had this trip, although I would have preferred a smoother first trip.<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s hear yours!

				Ok I&#039;m bored so I&#039;ll share one of my worst(best) experiences with weed.<br /><br />Let&#039;s start: It was my friend&#039;s birthday and we were celebrating, with weed, of course. We had about 5G for 4 of us and we were in a very crazy mood so we started hitting it from the pipe, bong, gravity bong etc. Before I knew it, I was higher than the space. I considered it to be psychedelic &amp; very intense at the same time. I had eaten before so I didn&#039;t have the crave for food, but we had loads. So about 10 minutes after taking the last hit from gravity bong, I felt something like... indescribable feelings. Because I had eaten before, my mind started talking to me and said: &quot;You shouldn&#039;t have eaten before you baked!&quot;(in, what I considered, a god voice) and I went to my friend&#039;s balcony and just threw it all up. It was kind of funny because my friend lives in a flat and on the like 5th or so floor. Also it was winter time so all my &quot;throw up&quot; wouldn&#039;t blend in, it would just stare at me. After being out there, in the cold, for 10 minutes or so, I went back inside. Because my body was empty I started to feel them, the EXTREME munchies. I ate everything, salads, sausages, pork, drank some sodas, beers. About 30 seconds after finishing my plate I went back to the balcony, just to repeat myself. Then my friend joined me, with a pure joint... I was like, oh what the hay, I&#039;ll do it. He puffed it twice and left the rest to me... I knew this wasn&#039;t going to end well... So after finishing the joint and going back inside, I went to the living room and someone was rocking on a chair(I mean they were like sitting on it and then going back&amp;forth, so the back side would be up for some seconds) and I just came there and because being that high I didn&#039;t notice it so I put my leg there and when he swung it backwards, it practically crushed my big toe... So I cried in pain and went to lay down for some time(this all had happened in 2-3 minutes) after that time the joint had really started to hit me good and when I closed my eyes I could see how my mind and physical brain went into a meeting room and started debating on the topic: &quot;Who does ME need more&quot; Then they started testing that on my body, meaning: I stood up and mind told brain: Oh you see, you couldn&#039;t stand up without me, and with that being said, I collapsed. Then brain said to mind I can stand up and I stood up, but kind of this weird way, 1 leg bent other shaking because being to tense. I don&#039;t know if that really happened(the brain &amp; my mind testing on me), but I woke up next morning still being on the ground.<br />If to speak about this experience in whole, then I loved it. I loved how intense it was, the way I wasn&#039;t always in control, I even loved it because I didn&#039;t love it(if you know what I mean). I think that has been the most fun I&#039;ve had in 1 night, EVER. (Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;ve only tried shrooms&amp;weed)<br />I hope you enjoyed reading this as much I enjoyed living it.<br />Please share Your stories, because it&#039;s just that damn fun to read them!:)<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I was camping with some friends and we all took some acid. 2 hours later one of the girls starts having a psychotic episode and is screaming at the top of her lungs for 8 hours. She was also saying weird shit about knives and accusing some of the guys of molesting her (they weren&#039;t even standing NEAR her). All of her insecurities came out in full force. I was really afraid that she would hurt someone. The worst part is that that was the only warm place or else I would&#039;ve gone somewhere else. So I had to put up with it for 8 hours. <br /><br />Never saw that crazy bitch again. D:

Each taking 4 g&#039;s each. I knew it was going to get a bit messy from the beginning... Most of them were just having your average freakout. The ONE girl though who ironically was the most experienced... ended up taking off all of her clothes and screaming gibberish for hours, attacking the others, etc. I ended up having to shuttle people back and forth the couple of miles from the beach to the house which took time ( I had a bicycle). We couldn&#039;t get the girl to walk so I had some kids stay with her on the beach. I ended up feeding her water like a baby and giving her grapes, lighting incense right next to her... Brought her out of it in about 15 minutes :)&nbsp; That was a wild day.

				I took some shrooms in Amsterdam with a friend. Misjudged the dose and, for about 3 hours, was so divorced form reality that I didn&#039;t know what the fuck was going on. what made it a bad trip was my fucking mate, a newbie to shrooms, who kept going into full-on panic mode - he thought he was going to die &quot;I&#039;m overdosing man. We need to call an ambulance, I need to go to hospital right now!&quot;. I should have explained to the prick that you technically can&#039;t overdose on shrooms, but I couldn&#039;t formulate my sentences properly, so I just left him to get sucked into a hole. <br /><br />Morale of the story: Choose your fellow trippers very carefully.

				First time with acid was my worst. I was in some grotty area of London and decided to drop two hits of som potent acid at a mates party. There was about 5/40 of us tripping balls with everyone else pissed up and stoned. So the night goes on and I&#039;m just getting bad vibes. So it gets to the end of the night and all the acid heads are still remaining and they&#039;re all playing with garden shears, holding them to each others throats and shit. I couldn&#039;t determine if the neg vibes were real or not. The next morning I&#039;m walking to the train station with a white shirt which had turned brown with my anxious perspiration and Jehovah&#039;s kept trying to stop me to talk about how I needed god in my life. I bet I looked like I did.

				It felt like I had snorted a line of pure shame, wasn&#039;t that bad, but fuck.<br />That mushroom just kept repeating it self, close my eyes and BOOM, mushrooms there like &quot;heycunt, we&#039;re here and we&#039;re fucking you up, HA. Does this feel good?&quot;<br /><br />Constatly.<br />Nothing could distract me from it, and that was my big mistake.<br />Glad they don&#039;t last too long.
