				Now, I&#039;m a man who embraces all aspects of his sexuality. I&#039;m of the view that if it feels good and it&#039;s not hurting anyone, then it&#039;s fine. <br /><br />I have this theory that most men are a bit gay...they just don&#039;t want to admit - or act on it.<br /><br />I&#039;d noticed that my fantasies have increasingly included men. They&#039;ve always been there but more so just recently. Then one day last week I just decided to give homo sex a try. I joined an online gay hookup site and posted a picture of my big black dick.<br /><br />I got lots of offers and yesterday met a dude and we sucked each others dicks. <br /><br />It was fun. Will defo be trying again. <br /><br />Get out there and explore your bi side boys. It&#039;s a whole lotta fun....

				I consider myself straight and never watch gay porn (I have before, but felt weird/didn&#039;t enjoy it). However, the thought of sucking a cock has really tickled my fancy for years.&nbsp; I wish that, in a perfect world, I could separate the juicy cock from the rest of the unappealing male body, but alas I am forever a borderline faggot.

				I wouldn&#039;t say that I have any hints of gayness in me :/&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a friend try to &quot;make me&quot; gay multiple times and I just don&#039;t have any attraction.&nbsp; I mean there are of course guys that even guys think look good, but in any case that doesn&#039;t mean that they feel attraction to them.&nbsp; I know some pretty great gays,&nbsp; and it is great that you are discovering your own way, but the tag that everyone is a little gay just doesn&#039;t seem to be solid :)

However, the thought of sucking a cock has really tickled my fancy for years.&nbsp; I wish that, in a perfect world, I could separate the juicy cock from the rest of the unappealing male body, but alas I am forever a borderline faggot. Or just a faggot in most peoples eyes. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty secure with my sexuality, so saying I&#039;m straight isn&#039;t like some sad denial, it&#039;s just how I&#039;d personally categorize myself. If someday I discover I&#039;m hot for the 100% male, that will change. So I guess in a way I agree that many males are a little gay, but I wouldn&#039;t generalize and say all. Maybe I&#039;ll go find glory hole someday.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just suck yourself off problem solved. Plus it might seem fun copping a load in the face but it&#039;s really not lol.&nbsp; ::)<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195892.msg1417343#msg1417343">Quote from: DrMDA on August 06, 2013, 05:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You guys do too many drugs. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
