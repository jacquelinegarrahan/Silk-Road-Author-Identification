				Was just curious but what is the difference between 2C-B, 2C-I etc. Are there different visual effects? Neurotoxcity? Or is one 2C product better than the rest?<br /><br />Looking to try a new party drug that doesn&#039;t have paranoia as a side affect. Sorry if this is in the wrong topic section.

				goto erowid.org&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or google phikal and thikal, they are available online actually threw erowid I believe.....&nbsp; but reallly no one should do any of these chemicals without first reading about them in the bibles I just mentioned.&nbsp; <br /><br />2c-i is alright&nbsp; for me not too visual or hardcore untill upper dosages.&nbsp; I have not done it in years though for me it has lots of body load, and I just did bunches of it and got old.&nbsp;

				I can&#039;t recommend 2c-b enough. It&#039;s got a very nice body high, some nice visuals, all around very pleasant. It&#039;s definitely one of my favorite party drugs. Somewhat like MDMA but without as much speediness (in my opinion). <br /><br />I don&#039;t have much experience with the other 2c&#039;s, but I&#039;ve heard good things about 2c-e.

No paranoia, and unlike many psychedelics its near impossible to have a bad trip because it also makes you happy. It just sort of pushes away bad feelings.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe there are any big studies on nurotoxicity, BUT, people have been using 2c-i and B for many years and have reported no long term side effects. I&#039;d say for starting go with 2c-i as it&#039;s a nice amalgamation of all the 2c-x chemicals, not too visual, not too much of a body load, not too long of a trip. Also, 2c-i has a nice level of mental acuity so you can think fairly logically if need be.<br /><br />It definitely makes a great party drug. Just be careful, your eyes will be HUGE so people can tell your a little fucked. I also find personally that while I&#039;m on it, I just don&#039;t care who knows that I&#039;m high (which can lead to problems).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Any information on neurotoxicity?

I find if I&#039;m INCREDIBLY active then it seems to end quite abruptly. Otherwise it&#039;s VERY smooth and gentle. The length depends on dose and what 2c-x your using, 2c-i is about 6 hours total (including the 2 hour come up). But, I find that if you take 10-15 and then bump it with a 5mg booster at the 2 hour mark (right as you start to trip) then you can extend it to around 7-8 hours total (it adds and hour or 2).<br /><br />I don&#039;t really notice any after effects. I get up the next day and feel fine.<br /><br /><br />Quick note, while on 2c-i greasy food will make you feel ill, also it&#039;s best to do it on an empty stomach. Lastly, DO NOT take 2c-i if you are on wellbutrin or you WILL have a seizure.
