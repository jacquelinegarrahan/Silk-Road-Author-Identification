				in your opinion how good is SR? i mean making money wise. cuz i noticed some prices are way to good to be true. how are you selleres making money? is the risk on selling SR and shipping worth it? or is it more helping, and getting people products that they couldn&#039;t before?

				haha maybe the prices are too good to be true because you have been ripped off so long you think that is the normal rate?&nbsp; ;)<br />Personally I am not in it for the cash but I reckon some vendors are doing very well

				I have not been selling long but I have done little more than brake even due to the bitcoin fluctuation. I am sure I will make more money in the long run now that it seems to be relatively stable. The value of bitcoins has hurt many vendors and even chased some away. I am here for the long haul though. I am hoping that the bitcoin will go back up so I can cash these in and make more profit.

				yea, I&#039;m counting on bitcoin eventually coming back up to mid-june prices, <br /><br />if it doesn&#039;t then I just spent the last 3 months of my life shipping drugs to people at cost.

				I&#039;ve been able to make some money, but I lost a lot of profit because of BTC fluctuation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Right now I immediately confirm shipment for all transactions so they&#039;re protected by hedge escrow.&nbsp; When I get the coins, I cash them out ASAP.&nbsp; Lesson learned after losing money.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I lost like 3 grands as of yet. But not because of SR but because of trusting the wrong people. lol...<br />I will just try to get it in again via selling what I have in stock.<br />But you are right, I am hardly making any money with my MDMA though I thought it was a good chance to make some money. Especially in MDMA&#039;s case I wonder how people make any money with it at all, its not as easy to cook as meth and though much cheaper. Cooks having a hard time with MDMA I think in comparison to other things.<br />Strange market is our drug market....<br />much love

				I&#039;m a seller in real life first, &amp; a seller on the Silk Road second. There are many reasons for that, actually, but a significant one is definitely the fact that I can actually make more money selling pills (&#039;cause that&#039;s primarily what I sell) in real life than on SR, because the prices that I can easily get away with charging in the city I live in (a dollar per mg for Roxis, for example) simply won&#039;t fly on the Silk Road, especially considering that both the cost of shipping &amp; SR&#039;s additional 6% fee get added into the total price. <br /><br />The reason I sell here isn&#039;t to make money... It&#039;s because I want the bitcoins. ALL the bitcoins I&#039;ve made so far from selling I&#039;ve simply transferred to my buyer&#039;s account &amp; ended up spending on other people&#039;s products.

				Different regions have access to different drugs at different prices, which is why some things on here may seem super cheap to you while other seem super expensive.

				I do not profit from my work here. In fact I am here solely to redistribute my BTC and buy other goods with them.<br /><br />This has worked out pretty well, but as a seller I can say it&#039;s not like the street - where you get rapid infusions of cash after unloading your gear.<br /><br />There is a due process for transactions; competition, and of course finalization. Sellers work very hard (or they should) for maximum bang for the BTC.<br /><br />I initially put in an investment of about $1,000 to get the ball rolling, and I don&#039;t even want to repeat what I&#039;ve made back so far... it&#039;s sad.<br /><br />Take the ubie for example...with postage and such I&#039;m breaking even, with about 2 extra dollars on the side...I only bought a 50 pack of them.<br /><br />With BTC fluctuation, regardless of hedging, this 2 dollars is unstable. Multiply that 2 dollars times a few transactions, and you really don&#039;t have much <br /><br />of an offset. But the feedback and happy customers are worth it. With other items I&#039;ve listed, I&#039;ve actually lost money in efforts to compete.<br /><br />So as you see there are many obstacles :)<br /><br />But that&#039;s not the point. :) I love everyone here and being here for people. <br /><br />So I&#039;m here to stay, unless commission deep dicks all of us.<br /><br />ï£¿L75
