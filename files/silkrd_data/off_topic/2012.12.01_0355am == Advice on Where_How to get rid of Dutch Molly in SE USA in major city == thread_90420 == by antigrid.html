				This is a kind of a stretch asking this kinda thing here but I really need to figure something out. I purchased a good amount of Dutch MDMA from Dutchaanbod here and am trying to sell it in real life rather than on SR. I do not know really anoyone except 2-3 people where I live now because I just haven&#039;t had much of an opportunity to meet people since I move here. I am in a major city in the SE USA and I know there are a ton of peoiple that roll in this city (def a popular rolling city). <br /><br />Obviously it&#039;s not like I can get on craigslist and advertise but there has got to be some creative way I can get rid of some of this stuff tonight, tomorrow, and the rest of the weekend. I figured I&#039;d ask for ideas on here. Maybe creative ideas some of you might have, I don&#039;t know. It really sucks to be flat broke with a bunch of FIRE molly lol. Obviously whatever it is there is definitely going to be a lot more risk involved, but that&#039;s ok with me, this isn&#039;t something I am going to do all the time. <br /><br />Any and all ideas would be awesome. You can PM me if you don&#039;t want to post publicly.

				Go to clubs while you&#039;re rolling. A lot of people looking to get some E will just look for somebody that they can clearly tell is rolling and just ask them if they have more or know someone who does.<br /><br />If you can, bring someone you trust so you don&#039;t get jumped. Otherwise, I&#039;d recommend bringing fairly small amounts with you so you don&#039;t lose too much if/when you get jumped.

				Molly should sell itself once you get one or two buyers. Go to a club and look for people that are a bit more fucked up than alcohol alone could get them. Look for people wearing kandy (those colored bracelets), go to a skatepark and sell to the local skaterats. Go to your local college and look for people smoking weed, or people who look like they smoke weed.<br />Honestly man this is pretty simple stuff, molly is pretty difficult to find for most people, so, like I said, once you sell to one or two people they will likely tell their homies and it should sell itself pretty quickly. If you actually go out and look for buyers, I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t have a hard time.

				I would agree with the suggestion to go to clubs/raves and either wait for people to ask you. or just walk around saying &quot;molly?!?&quot;<br /><br />If you think that&#039;s too sketchy, have a friend (who doesn&#039;t have anything on them) ask people if they are looking to buy molly, then have your friend signal for you to come over and do a quick transaction. <br /><br />Then, when summer/festivals come around, literally just &quot;open up shop&quot; and have a few friends sell the stuff and rake in the cash at those large scale events. Security tends to be pretty lax at large festivals. People sometimes don&#039;t have connections to good quality MDMA, if any at all. So there is a market.<br /><br />Also, start to get to know your customers, maybe try to become friends and assure them that the quality is superior to anything else (which it most likely is if you bought it on silk road). It would be a great way to make friends in your new location and also establish some solid connections. People know other people, and you could probably end up selling alot to one person, so they can re-distribute it to others themselves, and you not have to worry too much.

				pretty much how I do it. I use a 3 person operation in clubs but I would highly recommend concerts and festivals over clubs because at those the security is much lower. I have known tons of dealers getting busted or having to ditch their stash at in the trash at clubs because they got in noticed or were about to. Festivals is an all out free for all when it comes to dealing. Go to some electro shows at decently sized venues in your area and get it gone.<br />Like said before though if you have knowledgable friends that are in the club scene that shit should be gone instantly. In my are you say moonrock and people run to the atm <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90420.msg637720#msg637720">Quote from: XxWINxX94x23 on December 01, 2012, 07:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would agree with the suggestion to go to clubs/raves and either wait for people to ask you. or just walk around saying &quot;molly?!?&quot;<br /><br />If you think that&#039;s too sketchy, have a friend (who doesn&#039;t have anything on them) ask people if they are looking to buy molly, then have your friend signal for you to come over and do a quick transaction. <br /><br />Then, when summer/festivals come around, literally just &quot;open up shop&quot; and have a few friends sell the stuff and rake in the cash at those large scale events.

				Some good advice , thanks. I have never actually sold at a festival before, I have purchased, but I have sold lots before festivals but this was before I moved. Even at those festivals I feel like there are a lot of undercover cops. Obviously for every undercover there are 100 real prospects but since most people are only going to want a few capsules I would end up selling to a lot of people. What is a good strategy to do this (at festivals) without getting the attention of UCs (I will most likely know who they are so won&#039;t make the mistake of selling to them, but if they dont come up to me but see me selling...)? I had a guy come up to me once at Ultra Music Festival in Florida with a bandana and sunglasses on and said &quot;Hey Man! Got any X&#039;s???&quot; I just shook my head and said, &quot;I ain&#039;t that fucked up man&quot;. <br /><br />If I had a strategy that I was comfortable with I could make a nice profit selling at $20 per .1 capsules. And they are well worth the $20 compared to other shit that will cost $20 at the same festival. If you don&#039;t want to post a strategy here then shoot me a PM if you have time. <br /><br />I am far from inexperienced selling stuff. But I have always dealt with friends and friends of friends, never strangers and never at a public event. As far as rolling and selling, that is not something I like to do, I like to be on point when doing risky shit, but I know what you mean, every time I am rolling tons of people approach me.
