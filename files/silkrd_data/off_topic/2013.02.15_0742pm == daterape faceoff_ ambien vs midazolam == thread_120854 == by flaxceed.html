				In the past I have taken 1/2 a midazolam [Dormicum] tablet in order to get to sleep.&nbsp; it put me out like a light.&nbsp; Ambien is a tiny bit cheaper so I thought, what the heck- I will try anything once.&nbsp; So last night I took 1/2 of an Ambien (5mg).&nbsp; For sure it wasn&#039;t as effective as midazolam since it didn&#039;t knock me out.&nbsp; I went to sleep, but only after getting drowsy 2 hours into it.<br /><br />Fastforward to now.&nbsp; I just took 15mg Ambien (a tablet and a half) about ten minutes ago.&nbsp; No, no strike that.&nbsp; I took 5mg an hour ago- or maybe 90 minutes ago.&nbsp; Then I just took a full tablet ten minutes ago.&nbsp; But net I now have 15mg of Ambien in me.&nbsp; Anyone care to guess how this will go?&nbsp; If the lights go out you won&#039;t hear from me.

				I read somewhere that Ambien kicks in as quickly as 15 minutes which is why it is such a great daterape drug.&nbsp; But here I am wide awake a full 19 minutes into the deal- and at 15mg!&nbsp; Sometimes shit is all hype.&nbsp; But for me, midazolam is not hype but the shiznit.<br /><br />I should make it clear that I don&#039;t actually date women and sneak these pills (ground up into a powder) into their drinks so that they pass out and I can rape them.&nbsp; I do all that stuff with the pills, but then when they are passed out cold I take samples of any skin, hair, or fiber evidence that might be beneath their fingernails.&nbsp; I bottle it for later examination.&nbsp; No, I am joking.&nbsp; I really read them the bible while they are passed out.&nbsp; It&#039;s just I do the juicy parts and I masturbate onto their clothes or face or boots.

				I am 25 minutes in now with no drowsiness.&nbsp; Can someone tell me if this will kick in or something?&nbsp; Should I have snorted it?<br /><br />I just realized that I have put myself in danger of being the victim of the bible masturbation semen decoration debacle.&nbsp; I&#039;m not into male semen.&nbsp; If a young girl wanted to squirt or piss on me, that&#039;s fine.&nbsp; Ambien or no- she and I would be best pals!

				35 minutes into the 15mg of Ambien and I am a touch drowsy and a touch lightheaded but nothing really happening.&nbsp; Any professional date-rapers out there want to share?&nbsp; Or maybe you just use Ambien for innocent reasons?

				Ambien doesn&#039;t &quot;work&quot; for me anymore, at least not after that 100-150mg dose. I ended up falling into what I call an ambien hole, like the m hole or k hole. I was just gone. Now common to strong doses don&#039;t really do much of anything.<br /><br />No clue about midazolam.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been working with some liquid etizolam + everclear... definitely good for sleeping, chilling out, or... yes, a date rape.

Also oral midazolam has bioavailability of about 30% unlike most benzos&nbsp; but still IV midazolam has 100% bioavailability. So when I iv&#039;ed 5mg i was out in one minute .. By the way change thread name into zolpidem vs midazolam because it sounds strange one pills brand name other chemical name. By the way midazolam is used before surgery to induce amnesia so in my opinion it&#039;s perfect drug to incapitate someone.

Also zolpidem can cause mild hallucinations if done in higher doses. Also some people IV it for hallucinations.

				First, if you really want to get to know Ambien just shove it up your ass. I wake up with oral syringes in my butt all the time. Go to take a crap and the thing falls out... I&#039;m like damn, must have take some Ambien last night.<br /><br />Second, date rape is never funny. <br /><br />Third, clown rape is ALWAYS funny.<br /><br />If you can go to a bar, put drugs in a woman&#039;s drink and then talk her into coming home with you all while dressed up as a clown than whatever you do to her is not even legally considered rape. Plus, even if she wanted to be a bitch about it and go to the police how far into her story is she going to get before they can&#039;t stop laughing at the bitch covered in clown makeup and wearing giant red shoes? Laws vary from state to state and country to country but in general it is assumed that if you start drinking with a clown in a bar you want to get fucked.<br /><br />So don&#039;t ever date rape anyone. But if you do wear a clown costume.
