				Hey guys,<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been interested in trying mescaline for a long time now and when i found out about SR a couple months ago i got super excited to finally have access to such a wide range of psychedelics and other drugs... Then i looked at the mescaline prices and was a bit disappointed.<br />I&#039;d love to try it, but i also want it to be worthwhile (i.e. 350mg+) and also share the experience with others, but me being continuously I haven&#039;t been able to convince myself to take the leap and pay ~50 bucks for a single trip...<br /><br />Why is it that it&#039;s so expensive? Is it that hard to extract/synthesise?<br /><br />I guess i just wish I was rich and could order all the beautiful drugs I still want to try...<br /><br />Cheers,<br />SB

				- it takes 12-30yrs to grow to a decent size or when is worth consuming..<br />- then there&#039;s the preparation and extraction which all costs money...<br />- you can buy up raw / live cacti yourself but unless you know what you&#039;re doing, its a messy job and would it be any cheaper...dunno<br /><br />

				Honestly, if you want to just go to your local Walmart, Lowes, Home Depot, garden center, cactus nursery... <br />They all generally carry San Pedro Cactus... Its a really popular cacti since its a quick easy grower and looks plain and simple. <br />I bought 5 feet from walmart about a month ago for $15.<br />This will give you more than enough mescaline being youre willing to extract it or prepare it yourself.<br />Really all you need is a kife, water, stove, pot and blender and you can make yourself a nice powerful tea.

				you want cheap mescaline?<br /><br />Buy san pedro skin online, dry it out, grind it up, mix it with alcohol. separate&nbsp; the alcohol from the powder into a dif jar. then dry out the alcohol and scrape up the tar that is left over.&nbsp; Put into capsules and BAM.<br /><br />30 grams of dry skin is a good dose.<br /><br />do an extraction with rubbing alcohol(everclear is safer) <br /><br />If yo uneed more info, just search for alcohol extractions for mescaline on google.<br /><br />

				what you really want is the fleshy pulp of the cacti, thats between the waxy skin, and the firm white core.&nbsp; i&#039;ve seen dehydrated flesh material for sale on ebay.&nbsp; check out bouncingbearbotanicals.com iamshaman.com or maya-ethnobotanicals.com&nbsp; all 3 of these sites have different varieties of ethnobotanicals, but i&#039;m pretty sure you can get san pedro, or peruvian torch from any of them.&nbsp; peruvinan torch typically has higher mescaline content than san pedro.&nbsp; research the topic on erowid.org&nbsp; that place is a wealth of knowledge.

				Conservative estimates put Peruvian Torch at around 2-3% mescaline i think. Therefor 30g of dried should provide around 600-900mg, plenty to get a good trip. I read that boiling it in tea weakened it ? something to do with the heat breaking down the mescaline, but i was never very good at chemistry so im not sure if its correct. The alcohol extraction seems like the best bet to me. Seeing as you can probably buy 30g of dried cactus for around £25 (30ish euros) it is probably worth doing it yourself cost wise

				Do some research on trichocerous bridgesii.<br /><br />You can order the shit online very easily. Look up a bridgesii tea tek online. This shit tastes horrible, but will you will be FUBAR&#039;ed if you can manage to get it down.<br /><br />Also it was mentioned earlier, but an everclear extraction is another good option. Mescaline is found in many cacti that are legal and available to order online including (strongest to weakest IMO):<br /><br />-Peyote (if you are in EU i think its legal to order?)<br />-Bridgesii <br />-Peruvian Torch <br />-San Pedro <br /><br />Peyote and bridgesii have MAOI compunds in them that actually make the trip stronger than pure mescaline, but at the same time can have unpleasant side effects (i.e vomiting, etc), so be sure to do some research before consuming either.
