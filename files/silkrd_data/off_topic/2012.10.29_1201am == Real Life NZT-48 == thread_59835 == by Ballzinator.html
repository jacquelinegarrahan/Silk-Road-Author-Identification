				I definitely dont think its as simple as they seem to be saying, but there definitely is the potential to enhance cognition through the effects of drugs<br /><br />saying your brain only uses 10 percent of its capability i definitely disagree with - maybe at one time, but the majority of the brain is actually used, just for certain separate processes not usually needed at one moment. i think some autistic individuals demonstrate however their is greater potential for memory - those who can remember basically everything they have ever experienced... but they generally trade off for normal processing and social interaction - parts of their brains normally used for other processes, like facial cues, have been hijacked for memory essentially - therefore it would not be able to produce through drugs, its more of a physical alteration <br /><br />those first posts focus enormously on acetylcholine receptor agonism to enhance cognition - but a large part of that is also glutamatergic effects on memory they seem to be ignoring <br /><br />if you are asking if its reasonable to think you could take one drug and have it miraculously make you super intelligent, i dont really think this is feasible. i do however think there are chemicals which can enhance your natural capabilities however - just not to the extent you are probably thinking of because it has to do more with how one&#039;s brain is actually wired and set up from birth

His whole premise that we only use 10% of our brains is complete shit because for example the speech center can&#039;t be used for maths. Different parts of the brain have different purposes and using them all at once would be rather impractical :D<br />And of course it wouldn&#039;t work to the extent depicted in the movie.<br />What fascinated me about the post was the idea of using a small dose of a psychedelic as a nootropic. I&#039;ve never read about that but I&#039;ve actually discovered it myself. Sometimes I use about 2mg of 2C-P as a powerful and long-acting nootropic and it works! That stuff is way better than caffeine and MPH :D<br />It&#039;s a shame that galantamine is prescription only in my country. I&#039;d love to try it with 2C-P :(<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=59835.msg551538#msg551538">Quote from: Zulu on October 29, 2012, 02:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">haha i just take ritalin - they make me smart :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That stuff sucks compared to 2C-P :D
