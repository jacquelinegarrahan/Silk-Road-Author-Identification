				Better than Romney, but not all that great. He&#039;s had limited success in fulfilling his campaign promises, both in part due to fierce Republican opposition and a lack of cojones. We essentially had to choose between a turd sandwich and a giant douche, and I&#039;m afraid it will always be like this under the two-party political system. <br /><br />I hope his next four years are more productive, but unlike in 2008, I&#039;m not counting on it. This certainly isn&#039;t the beginning of the end though, and anyone with a passing knowledge of American history can tell you we&#039;ve had far worse presidents than Obama. <br /><br />jay92, why the hate on Wilson? Out of all our presidents, you pick the one who called for global peace while everyone else was out for German blood... You sir, need to open up a history textbook before you spout off nonsense again.

				the thing that pisses me off the most is that I think he got re-elected b/c the black and latino voters who voted for him solely on the fact that he is a black man(even though that motherfucker acts like a preppy ass white guy) some democracy huh? watch out Canada here I come : no this is not a racist statement just call it like I see it

				I thank you all for your vote. Know this, my fellow Americans, I, your president, Barrack, Obama,..... Yes i come forward to thank you all for your support. Know this, I will not rest, until,....my fellow Americans, we have come to the complete legalization of all drugs. I am cutting hundreds of millions of dollars of funding to the DEA and other drug enforcement organizations. That money will go forward to the opening of medical marijuana dispensaries in all 50 states.<br /><br />Thank you all again and god bless.

He hasn&#039;t shut down Guantanamo, he&#039;s been rather aloof about the NDAA expenditure policies, he advocates for the continuation of our failed drug laws, and most importantly of all, his economic policies aren&#039;t feasible in the long-term. We&#039;re spending more than we have in the bank, and I&#039;ve seen little from Obama with regards to fixing this issue. <br /><br />But again, Romney is a far worse candidate who has no realistic plans himself to change our economic policies. Obama truly is the lesser of two weevils: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvuTsKed-Po&nbsp; ;)

				OMG! Come on folks get wise. This was all set up from the get go. I knew who was gonna win the moment they started fucking Ron Paul around. Romney is just a republican puppet, a fall guy and always has been.<br /><br />Congress runs this shit, not the president. I&#039;m hearing Romney on C-Span right now and I want to shove a fucking grenade down his throat.&nbsp; BIG MONEY MAN!<br /><br />Hell yea I&#039;m glad Obama got it and I knew he would. Romney would have gone to great lengths to make sure marijuana was kept illegal. That stupid bastard wanted to rule the whole world.

Don&#039;t know what you&#039;re going on about.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />@lesser No, I definitely agree, and could add a few to that list, like very little action on climate change, not taking it to the banks when we had their balls in a death grip etc etc. If nothing else, our national elections wake me out of this progressive, somnambulistic state and remind me how conservative this country is, and that maybe it&#039;s enough to just get in a very moderate Democrat for eight years to start the process of swinging the country back towards a liberal/progressive direction. In 2016 could we elect a true progressive (fuck Ron Paul btw&nbsp; ;) )? Maybe in 2008 we just all got caught up in typical campaign rhetoric in expecting Obama to be this monumental progressive force. I think we just let the Bush tax cuts for the wealth expire (66% of the country agrees with me [election night CNN poll]), follow the schedule Prez Obama has set (another plus!) to completely wind down the Iraq and Afganistan wars, and that takes care of two of the three things Bush did to turn Clinton&#039;s surplus into the deficit that&#039;s got us in this mess in the first place. The third thing being Bush&#039;s unfunded prescription drug plan, oh which was fixed with Obamacare.<br /><br />So we&#039;ll see. My fear is that it&#039;ll just be four more years of hostage holding from the Republican-controlled House.&nbsp; &gt;:(
