				Yeah you can download it straight through Tor if you want to. Just launch it while Vidalia is connected.

				So the way Torchat works is that it sets up a hidden service for other people to connect to.&nbsp; Which is what Silk Road is.&nbsp; A Tor hidden service.&nbsp; That makes it easier to track you -- it does NOT make it EASY to track you, but it does make it easier to track you if someone wanted to.&nbsp; That&#039;s why all the IDs are weird funky random strings -- same deal as onion URLs.&nbsp; Your ID is your actual onion URL, and when you put someone else on your list, you&#039;ll show up on their list from then on too.<br /><br />Frankly I don&#039;t think anybody gives a fuck about you, and yes I think it&#039;s safe unless you&#039;re an extremely high profile target or something (and even then I&#039;m not sure anybody cares enough to go to the trouble a statistical correlation attack kind of thing would require)... but just be aware of it.

				Thanks for the info man :) do you know any other way of communicating on here that&#039;s faster than SR? it would be considered high profile in the next few weeks so need something safe.

				The link provided above is the correct one. Stay away from the c|net TorChat downloads and c|net dl.s in general. <br /><br />TorChat is always stuffing up for me, it has been like that for a while, so post back if it is up. As for is it safe? Yes. Find me a safer chat room or substitute and I&#039;ll go there. :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I don&#039;t know what &quot;stuffing up&quot; means.&nbsp; I also didn&#039;t bother looking at the link; yeah, that&#039;s the right one though.&nbsp; Just... download it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not exactly user friendly software, it&#039;s more Linux standard &quot;it works for me and it&#039;s cool and you might want to use it, but you&#039;re on your own if you do because I know how computers work and I didn&#039;t bother writing hand-holding for something free.&quot;&nbsp; As in... you&#039;re going to need to read to answer your questions if you really want answers.<br /><br />There&#039;s a Pidgin plugin that works if you wanna download that instead.
