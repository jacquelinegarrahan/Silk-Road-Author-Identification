				Well I figure I might shed on new information on what is happening.&nbsp; As you all know it was brought down.&nbsp; I had a few, accounts on each with alot of shady ass Private Key&#039;s going back and fourth.&nbsp; <br /><br />Selling all kinds of items etc.&nbsp; I used a private TorChat&#039;s for each major transaction via VPN using many Wifi&#039;s in or around a given area to add stealth.&nbsp; To give an idea about 50 or so....&nbsp; Alot right well I used Excel to keep track.&nbsp; Many Bitcoin wallets to wash etc...&nbsp; <br /><br />Well last night and for the past few days I have been a target of some LEO actions, the impossible happened.&nbsp; <br /><br />A drop address which was used once was raided, I mean raided.&nbsp; I had DVR surveillance hooked up that sends photos to FTP of it.&nbsp; All my transactions were private Key and the items purchased were almost 6 months ago.<br /><br />I bought drugs from here.&nbsp; Of course this forum name is different from my SR account as I like to stay stealthy.&nbsp; But one thing I back tracked was I used Tormail with the vendor and a Private Key.<br /><br />Now any logical person would say, your drop got burned?&nbsp; Well I ordered lets say an OZ of Meth/Blow it would have been a controlled delivery and it would have happened that day right?&nbsp; Not 6 month&#039;s later... <br /><br />Also two of my VPN&#039;s were hit by an IP that I tracked back to LEO ISP account.&nbsp; I have friends at all the major ISP&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Werid shits been happening lately with my Torchats,<br /><br />I randomly open them and I have gotten a few of the same people adding me on 6 of them.&nbsp; I tracked them back and well they were used for Buys from Atlantis and BMR and here...<br /><br />MY thoughts...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Tormail is the hands of LEO and they can crack Private Keys.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />All I used was private Keys and my computer I use I do not connect to the net for safety.<br />All my buys I kept detailed records on which PK and accounts I used<br />I have drops all over the USA<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Maybe my computer got hacked?<br /><br />All 16 of them half not on the net with Wifi disabled<br />All my VPN?S<br />All my phones?&nbsp; Most without cell phone service?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Im just high?<br /><br />Nope only do drugs when Im testing the quality...<br /><br />I mentioned Hackbb...<br /><br />I used the messaging side quite often and sent alot of the same PK&#039;s to members to buy information.&nbsp; Since both were on Freedom hosting I can only think, Ive been targeted as a high value crime...<br /><br />Out of the six Torchats where the same ID is adding me, I tested the waters and asked what I could do for them...<br /><br />Got this message..<br /><br />I was given you Torchat and wanting to get some @#@#!@#!@ I have MoneyPaks not stolen and wondering if you can use them.&nbsp; <br /><br />If any of you used Tormail for anything even with PK&#039;s keep a watchful Eye!!!!<br /><br />I still feel I am safe as this life online Ive hidden myself pretty deep using free Wifi&#039;s and throw aways.&nbsp; I have since took a hammer and send all my info to Davi Jones Locker... <br /><br />If I posted the photos of the raid they would know who I am on SR... <br /><br />I feel PK&#039;s are a joke now and they can be hacked with ease.&nbsp; I know for a fact my Keys were never on the net nor my computers were hacked.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Hmm, this sounds quite interesting, buy why did you post it in Off topic? <br />This would have probably been better posted in the Security forum.<br /><br />Locker.

				You emailed your private key?<br />Well... that was silly... Or am I misunderstanding something?<br /><br />Also, a vendor could have emailed an address to a colleague, unencrypted.<br />I&#039;m not sure what you are implying.

				I know I should have posted in the security section, but figure since this included a few other sites other then SR, it was off topic.<br /><br />Ive sent PK&#039;s via tormail and messaging on here and others, but my drop was only used from orders on here.&nbsp; I am very keen on not having alot of shit come to one drop.<br /><br />Just like everyone else on here and others we post out PK&#039;s to send data.&nbsp; If they did it, Sent plain text, that would explain one drop getting raided.&nbsp; Also the drop in question is a normal business of sorts, shared location rented offices etc.. So LEO survailed this location and gained access to the rented room.&nbsp; Luckly all business was offline and, but the words DEA were on vests and other monkies...&nbsp; <br /><br />Im a hacker by trade and gained access to the DVR and see everything..&nbsp; <br /><br />So what next? Are they closing in?&nbsp; My passwords compromised?&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not use the same password as others for these Tor sites.<br /><br />Given that all my logical facts lead back to my Tormail accounts &quot;Had a few&quot; that could be crossed with the same BTC or PK if it is data-mined could easily cross reference that each account belongs or was used by the same person or group. <br /><br />Also for that matter every address, btc was behind a PK.. Not the same program used ether.<br /><br />My post was to share a moment of HOLY SHIT!!!!!! with you guys...&nbsp; <br /><br />Given my drop was burned, numerous Torchats asking for old shit I dont dable in wanting to pay MP&#039;s or BTC is given me chills.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is the start or a crack down.&nbsp; My emails contained some shit..&nbsp; Not the average 1 gram of shit, but 300BTC payments... So let this be a wise mans tail..<br /><br />Vendors and buyers if you have had any ties to tormail and or fucked around on these now close sites well, consider your self on the list..<br /><br />Kind of pissed but hey its a game we play.&nbsp; Im X counter Intel type of guy...&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The feds didn&#039;t crack GPG unless you made a tiny key, your story sounds highly suspect to me but if it is really happened the first thing I would ask myself is &quot;Did I actually send a private key via tormail?&quot; and the second thing I would wonder if &quot;I wonder if they MITM a public key exchange over tormail?!&quot;
