				That&#039;s bullshit&nbsp; - I object. OP shouldn&#039;t just be able to have stuff removed at his discretion. He posted it I think it deserves to stay for everyone to see what OP is all about. You should be disgusted with yourself, OP.

				Alright well, first, he came in here and posted something along the lines of &quot;delete this&quot; and then also followed it up with &quot;please remove&quot; acting like the mods have all the time in the world to just do what he demands. The nerve of this guy. Coming in here... making demands... is this a precedent we want to allow? Exactly. Glad you guys were so interested in this cause, I was beginning to lose hope. But we are achieving big things here, establishing boundaries that new users have to know they cannot cross. We the people can make a difference, and in this thread today we did just that. Good job gentlemen.

				Yes okay but now what to do we do? Do we punish him or just give him a warning? Maybe we should make an example of him. Back to the newbie forum with ye! Or we could just make it clear from now on that actions of this sort are unacceptable.

				He did WHAT?!? you cannot be serious?<br />Right IÂ´m starting up a fund to pay some crackheads to gang rape him and all known family members, friends and pets then burn down all their residences and shit and piss on the ashes. <br />Wallet address will be up shortly. <br />ACE
