				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m a spoken word poetry writer/performer, and I use weed regularly. I was wondering if there might be another substance that could help spark one of those &quot;creative tips&quot;. <br /><br />Any other writers here on SR? Help me out!

				Certainly psychedelics (the 2C&#039;s and mushrooms especially). I feel as though we have so much more to say during a trip, as we become more creative and introspective. Some of the most heartfelt lyrics and essays I have written were under the influence of either a psychedelic. Some of my friends still in college swear by Adderall, but to each their own.

Also, small doses of 2c-i (5-10mg) are great for creative thinking as well. I have heard several good things about 2c-d and actually just received some in the mail so I&#039;ll let you guys know how it goes when writing&nbsp; ;)

I suggest you try it, kingsandman :)
