				I don&#039;t think ron paul=limetless...can&#039;t speak for the other, but it would take a bit of work for Lim to pull off being rp, since rp is supposedly ddw reincarnate from OVDB, and while we don&#039;t yet have that verified, and there may be a bit of doubt to that claim, I doubt it is Lim.

momentum for an object?<br />(static object = zero momentum?)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />All particles have an angular momentum.&nbsp; It&#039;s an intrinsic property to sub atomic particles and is partially ressponsible for the charge of that particle, the mediation of bosonic photon&#039;s being the majority of what dictates it&#039;s charge.<br /><br />All particles have an intrinsic angular momentum though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK let&#039;s do the math.<br />If p=momentum <br />and the momentum of a static object = 0<br />therefore p=0 (in the case of a static object)<br />E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^4<br />E^2 = m^2 c^4 + 0^2 c^4<br />E^2 = m^2 c^4<br />if you square root both sides then,<br />E=mc^2<br /><br /><br />EDIT: sorry for going OT.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I thought I explained what ANGULAR MOMENTUM was, but I guess I was not clear (???).&nbsp; I do not care, nor does it have anything to do with whether the object is static, <br /><br />p does not describe the movement of a particle in space.&nbsp; It describes an INTRINSIC property of a subatomic particle.&nbsp; &nbsp;p is NOT 0 and NEVER can be 0, if it were 0 that means a particle has annhiliated with it&#039;s anti-particle to generate pure energy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Higgs boson is the ONLY exception, and that&#039;s because it&#039;s not really a &#039;particle&#039;, it&#039;s a field which permeates all of spacetime in the entire universe.&nbsp; We only know of it&#039;s existence because one of its decay channel&#039;s (W+/W-) has provided us with enough statistical evidence to prove that there is &#039;some bosonic particle&#039; with about 125.6GeV.&nbsp; We still don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s a higg&#039;s boson actually, just that it&#039;s a boson, so unless it&#039;s a supersymmetric boson (unlikely), there is no other boson (force carrier particles) that it can be other then a graviton, which interact billions of times less then the other 3 forces and physics currently just ignores the graviton in experimental technique, so it&#039;s likely evidence of the higg&#039;s field and Peter Higg&#039;s will likely win the nobel prize before he dies (as he should).<br /><br />All particles are ALWAYS spinning, aka they have an angular momentum.&nbsp; They could be sitting in the middle of your lab held in a trap so that they cannot move (in space) but the particle itself is ALWAYS SPINNING, it&#039;s INTRINSIC to the particle&#039;s existence !<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_angular_momentum<br /><br /><br />PS:&nbsp; I fucking hate you lim and I hope your children come out all mutated like the (very poor and unfortunate :( ) thalidomide babies !!!<br />On a side note, if you can cool atom&#039;s enough they MOVE IN SPACE so slow that they actually generate a new form of matter that we call a Bose-Einstein condensate.&nbsp; Pretty cool form of matter because all the particles left &#039;coalesce&#039; and act as one giant super quanta.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Your original quote was &quot;E does not equal the product of the speed of light squared and mass&quot;. You bringing angular momentum into has nothing to do with it. But, you know what, after your little outburst, I&#039;m too tired to be bothered. Believe that Einsteins most famous equation is wrong, whatever. Oh, and that was sick what you just said about Lims future offspring. :)
