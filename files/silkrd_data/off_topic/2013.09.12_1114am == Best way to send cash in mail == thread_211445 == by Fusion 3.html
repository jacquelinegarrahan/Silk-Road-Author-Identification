				Just make sure the money is evenly distributed inside the envelope so it feels flat to the touch and check check and tripe check the address you are sending it to including a return address you have use of that checks out just in case there is an issue with delivery.<br /><br />If you want to send me a test shipment of cash to see if it all goes to plan I can give you an address ;)

				Put it in a small envelope, seal it, put that envelope in a padded jiffy bag between two sheets of medium cardboard.<br /><br />Also: recorded delivery would make sense if at all possible.

				I vacuum seal it... Just in case. Because some dogs are trained to smell cash.<br />And it make the notes evenly spread so it is perfectly flat.

				vac seal, keep it under 10k, 100 bills if you can. the less bulk the better. label printer is nice, makes the package looks more professional. put some kind of color barrier in there, like a magazine, and triple check the addresses. when you bring your pack to drop off, they give you a sticky pouch to put your label in and slap on the package. after that its good! oh and use overnight express.
