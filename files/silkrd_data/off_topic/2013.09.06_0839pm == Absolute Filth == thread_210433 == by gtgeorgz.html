				So I was speaking to a mate today who works for a large supermarket chain here over the UK, he told me that on average they have to throw away and destroy £6000 worth a WEEK of food products due to legal legislation&#039;s that the gov. have put into place. This is mostly due to food going out of date, but other reasons such as such as food arriving to store that has cosmetic issues or food that has been damaged on the shelf by customers. <br />The food store he works at is rather small and in a not very busy area. I dread to think what some of the larger stores are throwing away. They also used to give this food away for free to local charities, but then the gov. got involved and put some law in place to stop the retail of this kind of food &#039;waste&#039; all together. So now they have no option but to throw it all away. <br />I mean £6000 a WEEK, £6000 would before enough food to feed me for almost 4 years!<br />And YET the media and government are the first ones to blame to consumer for food waste. <br />What the FUCK.

				Yea that&#039;s why dumpster diving is a thing.<br /><br />I&#039;ll say I would probably rather eat the vast majority of what&#039;s being thrown out from that grocery store than f**king anything served up hot n&#039; fresh out of McDonalds etc.

				The food chains cant give that food away even if they wanted to simply because there are cunts lining up to make a quick buck by sueing a food chain because they &quot;got sick&quot; from out of date produce..<br />These are the ones you should direct your anger toward. Its a global problem. These arseholes are everywhere.<br />And people wonder why there is sooo much red tape involved with everything these days..
