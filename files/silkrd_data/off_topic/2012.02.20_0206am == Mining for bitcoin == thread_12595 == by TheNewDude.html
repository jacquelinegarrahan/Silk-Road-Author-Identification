(Multiple dedicated mining boxes with a lot of hashing power)<br /><br />It&#039;s easy enough to join a pool, run a program, and get free bitcoins.

The amount you get is based on your hashing power and your pool is much more likely to get the coins if they have a lot of hashing power.<br /><br />This is how bitcoins are made. <br />

				yep i mine too, its a nice way to supplement your buying on here, i currently have about 1.2GH/s on my setup and i pull in around 6-7 coins a week. ive said it before about the power thing though as long as you already have the hardware or dont mind shelling out on a new graphics card then even if youre just breaking even on the power bill then its basically the same as buying your coins slowly only without the hassle of the exchanges and if the value goes up youre laughing. oh and if you want to eliminate luck you can always go to a pay per share pool like elgius or btcguild etc<br /><br />@midas you are right difficulty increases roughly every 2 weeks or every 2000 blocks, but it can go up or down, if network power is low then difficulty will drop, if its high then itll go up, its all to do with the fact that there will only ever be a finite amount of bitcoins made, when we get to the point where about half the coins are already in circulation then payouts on each block will halve from 50btc per block to 25btc (so expect a jump in value on the coin when that happens, it should be autumn/winter this year if network power remains around the same)<br /><br />@fiveseven youre kind of right but also not, bitcoin mining is a supercomputing task, it doesnt NEED to be a gpu its just that they currently happen to be the best thing for it, current graphics cards have thousands of stream processors which kind of act as multiple processors, essentially your graphics card is a mini supercomputer, but all are not created equal, to highlight that lets take the example of 2 graphics cards, in the ATI corner we will use one im familiar with, my HD5850 a card now 2 generations old and which cost me Â£99 new, it pumps out 400MH/s. now in the nvidia corner we will put the top of the line GTX590 which weighs in at Â£600, result 193MH/s less than half that provided by the ATI card. so its not so much that you have to use a gpu for it more that currently atis gpus offer the most mining power for your electric. so technically the government could use their supercomputers to seriously damage the market should they write a reasonably efficient mining app and had no concerns about power usage (which i doubt they have) but soon gpu mining will die as fpga boards become cheaper and more widely available, currently fpgas based on the spartan6 chip can pump out around 200MH/s but will only use a very small amount of power. also there are plenty of people out there who have botnets setup for cpu mining, a single cpu may not produce much (my laptops i7 only makes 11MH/s) but if you can infect a few hundred or even few thousand systems then you could stand to pull in a lot of coins and again thats what a supercomputer essentially is, lots of processors working on the same task.<br /><br />oh and for those saying youll never get your investment back you may be forgetting that if you decide youre through mining you can sell your graphics card on (theyre still fine for games) and at the moment we are still above break even point on the power side of things, my cards have all more than paid for themselves already (sure i spent most of it here but id only have bought drugs with cash otherwise) so if i sell them on im still making a profit, that said now its pretty difficult to get hold of a decent 5xxx series card at reasonable prices so im not sure itd be as worthwhile to buy a full setup now (newer ati cards arent as good for mining)

				I&#039;ve been mining for a little under a year. I started when the price was about $3-$4/btc. Right before the big crash when the price was @ $30/btc I sold all my coins on virwox and bought a used motorcycle.<br /><br />I got really lucky, When i found out about bitcoins and silkroad I had just built a new gaming pc with 2x AMD Radeon HD 5870, so I didn&#039;t have to invest a dime. I started out making ~6 btc/day; now I&#039;m down to .5btc/day. Sigh... oh well, at least it limits how much drugs I buy.

				maybe so but if you want to expand youre mining setup you have other things to consider like power supplies and powering extenders for extra cards as otherwise itll kill your mainboard or just not start (some power is supplied on the pcie, so you have to cut 4 cables and wire them to a molex or something) with the fpga setups you can have as many as you have usb ports. i hadnt realised that theyd got it up to 300Mh or are you talking about the dual chip one? (would make sense as ones with a single spartan6 are usually 8-10w)

				I haven&#039;t seen my gpu go past 64c on Prime 95, so I think I&#039;ll be ok in that aspect. I&#039;ve heard that the 580gtx lightning isn&#039;t a good card for mining though. Any thoughts? I&#039;d be willing to join a pool, or preferably mine on my own if my GPU is suitable for mining.

				sadly any nvidia gpu isnt really suitable for mining, you can mine with them but itll cost you more in electric than just buying coins would im afraid, you can get a good idea of what your hardware will do on the comparison chart on the wiki, in your case its only about 140MH/s heres the link to see what everything else pulls in:<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison<br /><br />oh and unless you have a monster of a setup solo mining is pointless and by a monster of a setup were talking tens or hundreds of GH to your name, so unless you have a house full of video cards you need to join a pool. theres nothing to stop you going solo if you want and if you get lucky youll find a block and collect the full 50BTC but the chances are you wont and as such wont get a thing for your mining efforts
