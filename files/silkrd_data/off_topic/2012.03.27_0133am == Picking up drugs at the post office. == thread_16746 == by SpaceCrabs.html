				Are you in an apartment or something? Why would they not just leave the box at your door? How was it shipped?

				Whether it&#039;s in your name or not, going and showing an ID shows that you&#039;re expecting and accepting that package. If by some chance LE discovered the contents of the package, you could be giving LE reason to believe it&#039;s yours. I&#039;d tread with caution here.

				Showing ID doesn&#039;t prove you are expecting anything. Any normal citizen is going to go and try to pick up a package at the post office if a note is left. I wouldn&#039;t have anything in your house and make sure you either have your computer or your usb stick hidden in a secure location. It&#039;s most likely the post man trying to be thoughtful and not leave a package in the hallway. There&#039;s always the chance, but in case anything goes down everything should be clean and secured and you&#039;d just ask for a lawyer.

				Yeah, I get unexpected notes all the time, I go simply because I have a package... To me it would be more suspicious if you avoided the post office and never picked it up.&nbsp; Just play pretend in your head.&nbsp; &quot;Oh wow, I wonder who sent me this parcel, I wonder what it is&quot;&nbsp; Think it, then act it.&nbsp; Confidence friend.

				Had this scare two weeks ago, I live in an apartment with mail boxes the size of a milk quart :D<br />I went to the post office and luckily had a different package coming from the same state through an ebay vendor. This was just added &quot;security&quot;, walked up holding the slip and I was wisked to the front of the line by a woman who handled missed packages. Asked to see the slip, ran to the back, checked my I.D. and we smiled and parted ways. To my knowledge a signature is the only legally binding form of ownership, other than that good packaging and acting like you aren&#039;t engaging in anything illegal (to your knowledge :D) seem to be the best anti LE steps.<br /><br />Cheers

				I wrote my original response whilst really stoned and paranoid. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re fine. It actually does seem more suspicious not to pick up a package after a note is left for you. I know I&#039;d definitely be curious enough to checck out a package I was sent when I wasn&#039;t expecting one.
