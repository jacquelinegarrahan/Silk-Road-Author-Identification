				I just wanted to thank those of you who were acting like DPR crippled your grandmother, broke your daughter&#039;s hymen and euthanized every puppy in the world for the laughs you&#039;ve provided in this down time!&nbsp; <br /><br />Seriously, it was beyond entertaining to read some of what I&#039;ve read these past few days. <br /><br />I got to thinking ... if you want to post some of the most ridiculous things you&#039;ve heard over the past several days (in regards to SR being down and DPR romancing Hitler) that would be great and I&#039;d really appreciate it!&nbsp; I&#039;d love this thread to serve as a comic reminder of what has transpired here recently.&nbsp; Paraphrasing is fine but quotes are better!

				Haha I know! <br />Some of these people are crazy assholes. Still see some of them bitching at the moment. Think they have to realize THIS IS AN UNDERGROUND TRADING MARKET shunned by most of society and therefore the most unexpectable circumstances are bound to happen! Don&#039;t gamble more than you want to lose.<br /><br />I&#039;m just thankful for such a great team. I aint complaining! Glad to see things back up and running.
