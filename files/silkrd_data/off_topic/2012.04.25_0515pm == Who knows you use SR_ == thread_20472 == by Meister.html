				I&#039;m not overly paranoid, cautious and careful yes, but not overly paranoid. I&#039;m surprised at the number of posts I read here today of highly paranoid people, yet they are using a service such as SR so they can&#039;t be THAT paranoid can they?<br /><br />My biggest fear of using SR is not them being found in transit or being ripped off, but rather someone simply taking it from my doorstep. I&#039;m curious how many people on SR take the precautions of running their BTC through a series of tumblers etc, yet tell their friends about it who could easily turn around and knowing you work til 5 or whatever, roll by your house a few days a week at 3 and nab any packages sitting out there.

				I have a couple of friends for whom I occasionally order some MDMA or acid through here. They very rarely use, so it&#039;s more convenient to do it through my account than to have their own accounts, which would have horrible stats and be untrustworthy, etc. One of them does have an account, which he uses to windowshop and tell me exactly what listing to get. The other just knows I have some shady web hookup. Obviously, I get a small commission on their buys since I&#039;m taking the risk.<br /><br />However, neither of them knows where my drop points are. All they know is that I take their money and show up with Internet drugs about a month later.

And Google did the rest, of course. :)
