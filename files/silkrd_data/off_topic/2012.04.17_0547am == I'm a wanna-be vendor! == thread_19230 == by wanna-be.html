				I just want to say hi.&nbsp; I have a large supply.&nbsp; I&#039;m a really nice guy.&nbsp; And with me, you&#039;ll get high.&nbsp; But first I need to become a vendor and then I will become a sendor...shipping drugs all of the face of the globe.&nbsp; If only I can learn the Silk Road...<br /><br />I&#039;m willing to send 5 grams of my 40% pure cocaine to anyone who can help me get started.&nbsp; The bitcoins have me scrathing my head.&nbsp; Please PM me if you can do some 1-on-1 with me.&nbsp; Thank you!

				I don&#039;t understand why people ask for advice to be PM&#039;d to them.&nbsp; One of the main functions of this forum is for us to learn from and teach each other.&nbsp; So why not have conversations out here, where everyone can advise and learn?<br /><br />There are a lot of online guides to bitcoins, including many on this very forum.&nbsp; Ask specific questions, and people might be able to give specific answers.&nbsp; What has you confused?

				to be perfectly honest mate you sound pretty shady, there are alarm bells after reading your OP, something just doesn&#039;t sound right, but i&#039;ll give you the benefit of the doubt:<br /><br />it costs $150 for a vendors account. sellers guide - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/sellers_guide<br /><br />what do you need to know about bitcoins? you can buy them and sell them at mtgox, intersango and a load of other places, just put bitcoin exchange into a search engine on the clear web. obviously you need to buy $150&#039;s worth to get a sellers account to get you started<br /><br />i have no interest in your coke mate, and again, just being honest, unless you have something better to offer or are practically giving it away, for 40% coke you might as well not bother, as the market on here has far superior quality

				I gotta say, man, you&#039;re gonna run into a lot of issues if you can&#039;t even get BTC into a wallet yet.&nbsp; Maybe you should read some of the hundreds of guides out there (use the &quot;Search&quot; function, and Google) on how to go about BUYING drugs on SR, and practice all the BTC and anonymity shit by being a buyer.&nbsp; That would be the best way to research how the system works before becoming a vendor.&nbsp; This way, you&#039;ll be able to recognize what customers want, and you won&#039;t have risked your identity and well-being by being a vendor before you understand what you&#039;re getting into.
