				I&#039;m planning a trip to South America, one of the goals of which will be to enjoy some high quality cocaine. I would really appreciate any advice on where your average tourist is most likely to find the good stuff, without excessive risk. This isn&#039;t really covered in the guidebooks. I only have time to visit one country so suggestions please. Initial thoughts are Peru.<br /><br />cheers.

				I&#039;ve spent a couple months in Colombia. Great place and your money goes far there. If you are a white guy the women there will flock to you. There is a website called poorbuthappy that has a lot of good travel info. Oh and another random item, the strip clubs there are essentially brothels.

				I reckon Colombia mate, there is good cheap cocaine. I paid about $10 per gram in Medellin and about $15 in Bogota. I don&#039;t think cocaine is available in Peru as its in Colombia. Julio is right: the women love foreigners! Colombia is pretty safe in my opinion, just take care as you would anywhere in the world.

				I&#039;m a 6 foot and look white and I never got taken advantage of. But just like everywhere stay out of shifty areas. Medellin is great, lots of younger people. All the nightlife is in La Zona Rosa, bars and clubs every block. If you go in December through January its just one huge party. I&#039;ve been to the coastal areas such as Santa Marta, Barranquilla and Cartagena. These places are great if you stay in the tourist area. <br /><br />Like any county the best friend you can make is a younger cab driver.
