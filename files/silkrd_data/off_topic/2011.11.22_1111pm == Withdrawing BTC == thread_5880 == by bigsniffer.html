				I think this is a bug with SR. If I try send or withdraw bitcoins in anything but whole numbers, it says insufficient funds. Just try an even number.<br /><br />rusty

				I think I figured this out once. BTC are divisible to 8 decimal places, yet SR uses only 2 decimal places and your balance seems to be rounded up to the next 100th if you have an amount that is expressed in more than 2 decimal places that is 5 or greater. Example, I send 3.255 to my SR wallet and it shows as 2.26. I only really have 2.25 effectively because everything is priced with the smallest unit being 100th, or 2 decimal places, but my SR wallet knows I have 2.255 in it. Next I send 2.745 and now I have 5.0<br /><br />The wallet understands the unit .00000001 BTC, but SR only shows .01 as the smallest unit and seems to round up.<br /><br />I had the same insufficient funds issue where I would have to withdraw or transfer .01 less than my balance showed. I remembered that I had sent and odd amount to my SR wallet, looked back at the amount, transferred the amount that would bring the smallest unit in my balance to .01 and now I can withdraw or transfer the entire amount everytime.<br /><br />oxyhoot
