				Hello :), I know i&#039;m not terribly reputable on here but I have been using SR avidly for around 6 months and have never done anyone wrong. I need a 21 BTC loan as I am currently waiting on a 50 BTC MP and I need to order now because my adderall prescription will run out on friday and I&#039;ll be a week short of a refill with a huge tolerance, even if the MP somehow doesn&#039;t come through I get paid on friday as well so you should have nothing to worry about. I will pay back with 25% interest if thats fair or more if needed. My Sr username is Jamminjake22, these are my purchasing stats, they dont include a partially out-of-escrow purchase with googleyed which was $1500 in escrow $12,000 out:<br />Total transactions: 37<br />Total spent: $3628.2<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 3.2%<br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />Sorry for the long statement but there is a certainly a level of trust you need to have and I can&#039;t explain myself without a full &quot;Loan Application&quot; lol Also if you want to make this a full-time thing you should come up with a Default Loan Application for users to apply with :) Just let me know very quickly please
