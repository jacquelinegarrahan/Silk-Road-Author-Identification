				Been a member now for about a month or so.&nbsp; The worst part of the process was figuring everything out and learning - how to get btc&#039;s, how to get them to SR, learning PGP, after all that purchasing was easy.&nbsp; However, I would probably still be in the process of figuring everything out if it wasnt for the forums, these really are a godsend, everything Ive needed to know was either already available or was answered by someone.&nbsp; So a massive thank you to everyone involved - the crew behind SR, the vendors, the posters on the forums especially reviewers, the mods, EVERYONE....suppose I could have called this thread that - MASSIVE thank you!!<br /><br />Since being on I started 1 thread that has taken off, but been thinking about the thread - really it has no relation to anything, just a bit of harmless fun.&nbsp; Theres another couple I&#039;d like to throw up BUT dont want them to be an easy way for someone to quickly rack up 100 posts.&nbsp; Would it be possible to make posts in these threads not count?
