				Thackeray says he found evidence in 2001 of marijuana residue on pipe fragments found in Shakespeare&#039;s garden. Pot was grown in England at the time and was used to make textiles and rope, according to LiveScience. The Bard&#039;s Sonnet 76 refers to a &quot;noted weed,&quot; as well.<br /><br />http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/weird/Shakespeare-Was-a-Pothead-Says-Anthropologist-124704439.html

				they try to hide the history of weed..<br /><br />the history books would suggest they only used it for hemp, i think thats bullshit.&nbsp; George washington was collecting seeds to grow and get high -hemp cultivation was a major secondary interest.

				All the great philosophers, poets, writers, movers and shakers used drugs of some kind, often marijuana and psychedelics.<br />As did our founding fathers, and Jesus.<br />(See my secrets of the holy annointing oil of exodus thread for more information regarding drug use in biblical times)<br />There is no doubt shakespear did as well, Freud was a cokehead.

Some people can get into the psychedelic (i.e. mystical) state without the use of any drugs. <br /><br />But many great poets, at least in the victorian era, were inveterate opium eaters, and some experimented with cannabis as well. Byron, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, etc.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179234.msg1302313#msg1302313">Quote from: DMtryptamine285 on July 03, 2013, 11:14 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As did our founding fathers,</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There is no evidence that the founding fathers smoked marijuana. That appears to be an urban legend. I looked it up and could find no good evidence. Lots of pothead websites claim that George Washington or Ben Franklin smoked cannabis, but there is no evidence for this aside from the fact that they grew hemp for other purposes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and Jesus.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Very unlikely. If you&#039;re referring to the mushroom theory, there&#039;s no evidence for that either.<br /><br />However, it is probable that Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and other greek philosophers used psycedelic drugs as part of their initiation into the eleusinian&nbsp; mysteries.

				By the way, your &quot;evidence&quot; is like saying Obama smokes daily because they found a pipe with weed in it on the white house lawn by the gates and in a law he passed he refers to &quot;marajuana&quot;. Also pot is grown in america. Obama must be an avid weed smoker.
