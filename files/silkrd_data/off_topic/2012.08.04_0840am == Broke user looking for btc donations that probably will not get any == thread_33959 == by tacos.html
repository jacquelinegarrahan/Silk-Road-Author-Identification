				Eh whatever you could spare I am not picky... If I make even 3 bitcoins out of this I will call this a success. Anyways just a new user who joined the road as the coins started skyrocketing and incoming money has slowed to a trickle. Happy for what I have gotten, but still wish I could get so many more things off the road. Anyways as I said just throwing out this request for random donations for a new user who would appreciate any kindness.... Although who wouldn&#039;t right?<br /><br />Edit: If you do decide to donate I recommend sending me a PM so hundreds don&#039;t ask you for donations&nbsp; ;)

				Really?&nbsp; SR needs a new forum with a Big sign on the front that says &quot;Need Money For Drugs&quot; for posts like this!<br /><br />Dude, on your 2nd post here you are asking for money?&nbsp; I hear there are some &#039;open&#039; freeway off-ramps that aren&#039;t being used yet!&nbsp; :-\
