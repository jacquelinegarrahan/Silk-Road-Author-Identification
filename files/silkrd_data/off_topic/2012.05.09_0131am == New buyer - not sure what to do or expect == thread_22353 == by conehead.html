				Placed my first purchase from DudeRugs.<br /><br />I sent him a message 2 days ago on what to do and expect and haven&#039;t gotten a response. Yesterday I ordered and paid hoping that would spur him along. I&#039;m sure he is very busy.<br /><br />So what do I do? He requires new buyers to FE so he doesn&#039;t get scammed. He has a good rep as best I can tell, so I guess that is just a risk I have to take. However there is no way for me to FE. It has the text &quot;cancel&quot; but it&#039;s unclickable and there is no other button/text for me to click to finalize the payment.<br /><br />Am I in a holding pattern until he gets to me and accepts the order or something? He has been online but I guess hasn&#039;t gotten to me if that is the case (which is fine, I&#039;m in no big rush.)<br /><br />I just want to be sure that there isn&#039;t something else I&#039;m suppose to do.

				I have read the buyer&#039;s guide 4-5 times. I am unclear on the processes it glances over. I have already transferred bitcoins, placed the order, and it says &quot;processing&quot; which is my question.<br /><br />Is there anything else I need to do or do I just wait for him to get around to me?<br /><br />Thanks for the fast reply.

				There is nothing else you need to do. It&#039;s up to the vendor to mark it as shipped now.

				I sent a message to him, hell, lemme check, &quot;Unable to connect&quot; Oooffff fucking course. <br /><br />None of you will understand what a pain in the ass it was just to look at my messages. <br /><br />Anyways, sent him a message regarding a purchase 5 days ago, he still hasn&#039;t read it. Either he&#039;s busy, or dead. <br /><br />Either way, I got my shit from kwiktrip. :)

				Speaking from the sellers perspective here don&#039;t worry that he ain&#039;t got back to you. We do have quite busy lives to be fair and although I am online most of the time others aren&#039;t always. Different sellers work in different ways so you just have to roll with it. <br /><br />The guy is legit so I wouldn&#039;t worry, he&#039;s just got some shit to do. :) I personally can&#039;t ship at all this week because I&#039;m on a business trip at the moment but I&#039;m still online. Can be any number of reasons. <br /><br />CHILL WINSTON, IT&#039;S GONNA BE OK, THE GANGSTAS ARE GUNNA MAKE IT OUT THE GHETTO! :P

				Thanks again awesome!<br /><br />I was more worried that I had fucked something up than the time it is taking him to respond. I&#039;m sure he is a very busy person. Glad to know you think he is legit. He certainly seems to be. I am in no super hurry. The only reason I went with him over qwiktrip was the bonus for FE&#039;ing customers. I *had* to FE as a new user so it seemed silly. I can&#039;t even try them for weeks, and I know it is not something I&#039;m going to be able to do, or even want to do, very often. I haven&#039;t tripped in a decade. I just wanted to try it once or twice maybe and I&#039;ll probably end up giving them away to friends.<br /><br />Thanks for the input people!

				Thanks!<br /><br />It seems with all the LSD vendor bullshit going on, he is very busy putting out alternative product. He updated his vendor page saying he was pulling his products so he could catch up. Discrete shipping is difficult for high volume shippers I can imagine.<br /><br />I&#039;m still waiting, but I can only infer by his post that my package is en route and should arrive in the next few days, maybe even tomorrow.<br /><br />Here&#039;s hoping! Dude seems legit, but with all the insanity that has happened, and this being my first (and probably last) transaction, I&#039;m a little anxious! :)<br /><br />
