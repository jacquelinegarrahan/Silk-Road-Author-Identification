				I&#039;m wanting to buy a friend of mine a nice amount of weed for Christmas. The thing is, I know literally nothing about it. I&#039;ve only done it twice and never found much interest in it. Anyway, could someone please point me in the direction, or offer advice, about what the best quality is and what I should look for? I&#039;m looking for top-quality. Vendor names are fine too. :).&nbsp; US preferred. <br /><br />Thanks!

Two grams should run you about $5 for the really good shit. ;)

				have you thought about getting this friend some hash? as a stoner i can confidently say a nice chunk of hash would make for an awesome christmas present!<br /><br />i have not purchased any weed or hash off sr YET, so i can not really vouch for any vendors/ refer you to any, but find vendors with the highest feedback scores, and read reviews...they give you a really good idea of things like product quality, stealth quality, shipping time, etc.<br /><br />good luck, hope you find something good for your friend

				OP - it looks like today might be your lucky day!&nbsp; Christy Nugs would make an EXCELLENT Christmas gift. If you have PGP, you meet the criteria to buy from her. Jump on it, dude, you can&#039;t go wrong&nbsp; :D
