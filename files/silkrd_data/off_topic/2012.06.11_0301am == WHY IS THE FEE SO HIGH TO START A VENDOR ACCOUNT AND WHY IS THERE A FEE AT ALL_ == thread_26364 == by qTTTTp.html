Its so unresonable THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SELL YOUR ILLEGAL GOODS ONLINE WHERE YOU CANT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE!! <br /><br />WHY CANT THE ADMINS OF SR TAKE SUCH A BIG RISK OF RUNNING THIS WEBSITE OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART??? I mean we HAVE TO PAY!!! omg so unfairrrrrrrrrr <br /><br />WHY CANT ADMINS DO EVERYTHING FOR FREE AND SPEND ALL THEIR TIME RUNNING THE SITE BECAUSE THEIR SO KIND OMG.... <br /><br />IM SO FUCKING ANGRY!!!! INSTEAD OF JUST GOING ELSEWHERE AND NOT USING THE SITE IM GOING TO BITCH!!!<br /><br />I cant believe admins are so selfish god.... i mean who makes a service AND ACTUALLY CHARGES FOR IT??? no business is ran like that!!!!1 <br /><br />I JUST REALLY REALLY WANT VENDOR ACCOUNTS TO BE FREE SO THAT TONS AND TONS OF SCAMMERS CAN REGISTER AND MAKE SCAM LISTINGS OMG..... LIKE SO MANY VENDORS WOULD HAVE A VALUABLE SERVICE IF THEIR WASNT A FEE!!!! OMG SO MANY PEOPLE COULD SCAM!!! WHATS WRONG WITH THIS OMGGG IM CALLING THE POLICE AND SAYING THIS IS UNFAIR

				Yea, what Vendettent said without the sarcasm. The fee keeps out loudmouths like qTTTTp. I payed the $150 fee and I&#039;ve been a happy vendor ever since. You gotta pay to play bub. If you don&#039;t like it go somewhere else to sell your illegal goods and good luck finding another place as good as SR. I&#039;m sure our friendly Mod Lem will tell you to &#039;FUCK OFF CUNT&#039; when he gets back from vacation.<br />&nbsp;<br />And I +1 for&nbsp; Vendettent. -1 for qTTTTp.&nbsp; ;D<br />

				Less scam vendors. I believe it was originally a response to an anonymous threat from a faggot. Said faggot claimed he would make a vendors account, then send poisoned drugs to people. Ain&#039;t dat sum sheit.

				I think it&#039;s pretty fair considering that money makes legitimacy. If you&#039;re a broke ass vendor that can&#039;t shell out some dough, you shouldn&#039;t be messing around with other peoples stuff. Plus it makes it so you have to convert to bitcoins at some point.

No more than eBay, a newspaper charging for ads, or your local market. They charge a commission for allowing you online access to sell here anonymously. The fee also weeds off scammers and the reason for charging the fee was a demented guy claiming he would create vendor accounts and sell harmful items posing as unharmful ones.<br /><br />Do us a favor, take off caps lock, shut off your computer.<br />If you can&#039;t come up with $150 I highly doubt you can safely sell anything of quality here.

				Wow! It&#039;s&nbsp; only 150$ for a sellers account? Cool i thought it would cost more.. A vendor wouldn&#039;t need many sales to break even on that one . To op: POSTS WRITTEN IN CAPS ARE THE MOST ANNOYING THING I SEE ON TEH INTERNET!! even more so than trolls.. Why shouldn&#039;t the people that have made this place for OUR convenience and freedom earn a little buck of it? Do you think this is some kind of hippie project just to be nice to people? Go find a corner to sell your stuff on it&#039;s free..&nbsp; <br /><br />Edit: what are you supposed to sell if it&#039;s so difficult to earn back the 150?

Spend countless hours working on the code, the security, the fear in the back of your head of being caught. Do so and then offer vendor registration for free and you&#039;ll only end up with BMR.

				I believe that with out the fee the SR marketplace would crash. There would be so many scammers that people would stop coming to the site. It&#039;s incredibly low priced and worth it. Look at how much it cos to start up a franchise business or even a small brick and mortar business. We got tons of people online trying to make money by telling everyone else how to make money. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot more to consider then just the fee for the vendors account. Look at how the market works. A person needs to be prepared to stay in escrow. They need to have a good supply of product. They need to have a quality shipping method and they need to be ready to give out freebies to get the ball rolling.<br /><br />Honestly anybody who is complaining about the fee to get a vendors account is no where near ready to be a vendor

				Wow when I saw the title of this thread I was expecting to see that it costs thousands to set up a vendor account. $150 is chump change. At one point original poster asked if you can really make back $150. Duh! Some deals probably have that type of profit margin on a single order. If anything I would argue the bar is too low at $150 and little kiddie vendors could setup shop. I&#039;d rather have some confidence that I am dealing with professionals who understand that it costs money to make money.<br /><br />I guess beyond that I&#039;m not sure why we&#039;re all indulging this troll!

				Although I do not agree with the OP, I for one, would become a vendor right at this moment, providing many high quality pharmaceuticals if not for the vendor fee... but that is only because I do not have that money, at least not online. Although I do plan on purchasing a license as soon as I have the money.

				You can possibly turn over thousands a day, which imo, makes the vendor price absolutely miniscule. If your serious about selling here on Silk Road, you would invest in your business, just like anything else.<br /><br />If not, there&#039;s always TBMR, no vendor fee, but not up to standard tbh.<br />Locker.

				Threads like this make me really quite angry. It&#039;s basically the same as thinking that as an individual you have the RIGHT to trade here. <br /><br />Let&#039;s lay this out quite clear to those that don&#039;t get this. Nobody has the RIGHT to sell here, it&#039;s something you pay for (which shows face) and then you work hard to keep. The prices are minute in comparison to the benefits you get from selling on SR, it annoys me that I even have to make this point but I&#039;ll kick out a few of the perks to illustrate the point. <br /><br />1. Global market.<br />2. Secrecy.<br />3. Safety.<br />4. A regulated and controlled sales platform.<br />5. Protection from theft. <br />6. A shop front. <br />7. Access to more resources/knowledge than most street-dealers wank over at night after watching Scarface.<br /><br />The prices that you pay as a vendor on here are so minute in comparison to what you get in return it&#039;s silly. DPR isn&#039;t just inviting you to dinner, he&#039;s basically saying he&#039;ll give you a 5 course meal with a bottle of Cristal every night for life and all you have to do is bring a bottle of cheap Rioja and play by the rules and put a bit of effort in. <br /><br />If you are going to moan about that.....you aren&#039;t even serious about becoming a vendor or business in the first place. You have to invest in your business/future, life isn&#039;t about free handouts. <br /><br />FML...

				I think 150 is very reasonable. I will be starting a vendor account this week. I am surprised it isn&#039;t a little bit higher though. If you think about it you are gaining access to 100,000+ users? for only 150 bucks.....also anonymously. That is an amazing deal, especially if you have a really high quality product that most people IRL won&#039;t appreciate. I have had so many friends IRL that tell me I am crazy for asking what I do for the molly I buy on here. So since they won&#039;t pay what I pay so I just cut it with 5&#039;htp or something and sell it to them at the price they expected even though they could have bought the pure from me and it would of been half the weight but who cares if you are&nbsp; still getting just as high. Especially if you have chems that are not as famous like the 2cx&#039;s and dox&#039;s you can sell them here for what they are and make more then selling them IRL.

				Its necessary to have some sort of &quot;keep&quot; to stay legit and use this service, safety is paramount, but 150 is too much, i would sell my wares here otherwise, but im only small time and have things from time to time so its actually alot of money to some believe it or not, IMO vendors should have a choice to pay this 150 or agree to do a number of samples or large cod&#039;s to long term legit buyers to prove authenticity and show their for real in for the long haul with a professional service etc, just a thought?

It also helped me to get started changing small amounts of cash to Bitcoins for people as I pointed out that I would hardly rip them off for sake of a few of our British pounds if I&#039;d already paid 100 of them to become a vendor! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah it does make sense when you say it like that alright vlad, I appreciate the advice and respectful answer too mate,<br /><br />&nbsp;Is it a one off 150dollar/converted bitcoin fee you pay?&nbsp; Or a certain percentage taken from everything that you sell on here though? If its a one off of 150 and thats, thats fine, but there should be no third party involved after that, just buyer and seller.

				When it comes to illegal drug sellers (drug dealers, for want of a better word). I&#039;d be suspicious of a poor one! They either make no money selling drugs (and therefore either have bad product or bad business practices), or they&#039;ve just started out (and I&#039;d rather go with a proven dealer, for many reasons).<br />So, I think the vendor fee does at least offer a bit of quality control. <br /><br />I believe someone once claimed they&#039;d get a vendors account and maliciously send harmful things instead of the advertised product. And, when bad review started to come in and word got round, they&#039;d change to a different vendor account. So, one reason the vendors fee was brought in was to stop such attacks on our community. This is just something I&#039;ve heard.<br /><br />Silk Road do deserve to make money for the great thing they&#039;ve built. Long live the Road!
