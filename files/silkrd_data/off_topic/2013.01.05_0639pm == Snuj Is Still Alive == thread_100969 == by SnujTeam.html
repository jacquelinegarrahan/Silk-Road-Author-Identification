				Over 100 members.&nbsp; Vendors are from SR and we&#039;re looking for buyers for these vendors as they have discounted rates typically, lower than SR.<br /><br />http://snujl7n5dahb4zny.onion/market/index.php

				I wouldnt trust this site.&nbsp; If there are vendors from SR, make sure their GPG key is the same and send them an encrypted message to make sure its really them.&nbsp; How do we know the opperator of this page isnt going to run with our money in escrow (if escrow is even an option on this site)<br /><br />Id rather FE on silk road than use one of these untrusted sites.

				It&#039;s not down, you simply have to register to gain entrance.<br /><br />There is a escrow system.&nbsp; Please read the FAQ.&nbsp; The vendors are SR vendors, contact them if you wish.

				Seems like it would be the vendors who take the biggest risk. For buyers, the risk seems small if they use some reasonable precautions.

				http://snujl7n5dahb4zny.onion/market/index.php works just fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is little risk involved to the buyer.&nbsp; Of course, there is always a chance the seller could have problems, however we do not ask them to advertise Snuj on SR.<br /><br />Typically since we charge a lower commission rate, the prices on there are cheaper.

				I&#039;d actually like to see a moderator opinion on this, because I consider this spam/scam/shilling. You aren&#039;t a vendor here, and you&#039;re adverrtising another service. <br /><br />

God no, not yet at least.&nbsp; I&#039;m sending a final reminder to the vendors out there over the next few days to tell them they have 2 weeks before there are vendor fees are in place.&nbsp; This way it gave a total of 3 months to get them on board.&nbsp; The vendors we have are active and do deliver, but we&#039;re still trying to get the remaining and new ones aboard.<br /><br />I know this will take a while, and expect it all to take a bit to start moving forward, but in the mean time I still manage it and make sure the server is running properly.<br />
