				Hello, I made an error in my calculations for the amount of BTC I needed for an order. I try to get (Amount) +1 BTC&#039;s for price fluctuations and other variables, but my error stems from a change in shipping method for a larger quantity. While I was spot on for the price&nbsp; at (price + 2 BTC (shipping) + 1 BTC extra) I did not check to ensure that the shipping price was in fact the same. Of course--with my luck--It wasn&#039;t and has went from ~2BTC to ~4BTC and my 1BTC extra has fallen to ~1 BTC below cost.<br /><br />If anyone could help me out, I will gladly return the [Amount * 1.05] for a 5% loan fee. (The loan will be repaid within 7 Days of receiving (By Fri 6/1/2012), because I only deposit BTC once a week.)<br /><br />All you need to do is reply to this thread stating that you will give me a loan, I will confirm it, and once repaid I ask that you reply to this thread stating that the amount was paid in full. I feel this promotes pure transparency of the exchange and allows the community to monitor the thread, giving the loaner the power of the community behind him if a dispute were to come up.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out!

				I forgot to add that my SR name is the same as my forum name. If you send it directly, I will return it directly through the same channel. If you need a BTC address, please pm me and we can exchange BTC addresses.
