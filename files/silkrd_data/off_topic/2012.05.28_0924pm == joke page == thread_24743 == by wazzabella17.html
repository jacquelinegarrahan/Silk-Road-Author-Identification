				An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman were sitting in a bar, drinking and discussing how stupid their wives were. <br /><br />The Englishman says, &quot;I tell you, my wife is so stupid. Last week she went to the supermarket and bought $300 worth of meat because it was on sale, and we don&#039;t even have a freezer to keep it in.&quot; <br /><br />The Scotsman agrees that she sounds pretty thick, but says his wife is thicker. &quot;Just last week, she went out and spent $17,000 on a new car,&quot; he laments, &quot;and she doesn&#039;t even know how to drive!&quot; <br /><br />The Irishman nods sagely, and agrees that these two woman sound like they both fell out of the stupid tree and got hit by every branch. However, he still thinks his wife is dumber. &quot;Ah, it kills me every time oi think of it,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;My wife just left to go on a holiday in Greece. I watched her packing her bag, and she must have put about 100 condoms in there. And she doesn&#039;t even have a penis!&quot;<br /><br />

				One day, Little Johnny hears a noise and peeks into his parents&#039; room to check it out. He finds his mom bent over the dresser with his dad going at it behind her. His dad sees and winks as Johnny closes the door.&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, his dad goes to check on Johnny. He finds Grandma bent over the dresser and Johnny going at it behind her. Dad yells, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Johnny replies: &quot;It&#039;s not so funny when it&#039;s your mom, is it?&quot;<br /><br />

				These threads cheer me up. Here are some I just stole from a website.<br /><br />Heisenberg is out for a drive when he&#039;s stopped by a traffic cop. The cop says: &quot; Do you know how fast you were going? Heisenberg replies: &quot;No, but I know where I am&quot;.<br /><br />An infinite crowd of mathematicians enters a bar.<br />The first one orders a pint, the second one a half pint, the third one a quarter pint...<br />&quot;I understand&quot;, says the bartender - and pours two pints.<br />

				A woman sped over a bridge only to find a cop with a radar gun on the other side lying in wait. The cop pulled her over, walked up to the car with a patronizing smirk and asked: “What&#039;s your hurry?”<br />“I&#039;m late for work,” the woman replied.<br />“Oh yeah,” said the cop: “And what do you do?”<br />“I&#039;m a rectum stretcher,” she responded.<br />The cop stammered: “A what? A rectum stretcher? And just what does a rectum stretcher do?”<br />“Well,” she said: “I start by inserting one finger, then work my way up to two fingers, then three, then four, then I get my whole hand in. I work from side to side until I can get both hands in, and then I slowly but surely stretch it until it&#039;s about 6 feet wide.”<br />“And just what the heck do you do with a 6-foot asshole?” he asked.<br />“You give him a radar gun and park him behind a bridge.” <br /><br />
