				Anarcho Capitalist......there are a lot of flavors as there are in any &quot;designation&quot; but most are libertarians who came to understand that Rothbard&#039;s conclusions were right.<br />Govt is violence by its nature and if I as an a individual don&#039;t have a right to initiate violence (like threatening to jail you or shoot you should you resist to pay me what I think you owe me without your agreement or any contract to that effect), I don&#039;t gain that right by forming larger and larger groups.<br /><br />When you follow the logic all govts (or any groups) are illegitimate unless completely voluntary and the right to stop participating in the groups activities are always respected. Those groups need not be based on geographical regions either, as THIS particular group proves.<br /><br />Govt by their nature capture all people within their boundaries, some shove that fact in their faces but other try their best to mask the fact that they have indeed enslaved their people. <br /><br />If you accept that fact you realize waving flags is just falling for their tricks.

				I had to do some google-based research on Rothbard after seeing your post.&nbsp; Nah...&nbsp; that&#039;s not me.<br /><br />First and foremost, I&#039;m just an old stoner.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doin&#039; dope since before most of these young whipper-snappers were a gleam in their grandfather&#039;s eye.<br /><br />I have been fascinated by public-key encryption for a long time now.&nbsp; As a math/computer geek, I loved the notion of sharing something that nobody else could hear.<br /><br />At heart, I&#039;m a social-libertarian with serious lefty economic bents.&nbsp; My lefty economic bents are probably considered tame by the standards of most of the world.&nbsp; I&#039;m a capitalist, insofar as I think that managed socialist economies don&#039;t work either, and that the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; shit is truly fugged.<br /><br />I love the fact that SR has created an anonymous marketplace for drugs.&nbsp; If there is a reason for cryptography and anonymity in this world, given the current stance of all govt&#039;s, this is it.&nbsp; I hope like hell that the math is right, and that they&#039;re fugged, as as far as trying to bust this shit down.<br /><br />I love the fact that there are folk on these forums trying to make sure that people are careful and knowledgeable before putting things into their bodies that arrive in the mail.<br /><br />Given my salute on 7/4/11 to Freedom and the American flag, all I can say is that I&#039;m just one more of that silently majority who believes that self-governance is a grand idea, but that it has been sorely perverted by those that wield money over the entire process.<br /><br />You got a name for this notion?<br /><br />- Bit

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You got a name for this notion?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, corporatism.<br />The unholy alliance of big business interests and govt.<br /><br />Most lefty&#039;s think corporatism IS capitalism but if their were no installed system of coercion (violence or the threat thereof) making rules that benefit them and set the bar to high for competitors to clear, thus allowing them even more influence both monetarily and politically (one in the same whenever democracy exists), the ferocity of competition would keep things in check.<br /><br />True unhampered capitalism (as we try to practice here, but them again, the margins on the products sold here would not be so high without the prohibition on that institution of organized violence that us suckers lend a face of legitimacy to....ie The State) is but one component of corporatism.<br />A lot of people need to see that IMO.<br /><br />When a gangster forces your way you may obey but you will never see him as legitimate. Not so with the biggest gang ever...the US govt.<br /><br />I leave you with a quote from Lysander Spooner (the real one):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1. It is true that the _theory_ of our Constitution is, that all taxes are paid voluntarily; that our government is a mutual insurance company, voluntarily entered into by the people with each other; that each man makes a free and purely voluntary contract with all others who are parties to the Constitution, to pay so much money for so much protection, the same as he does with any other insurance company; and that he is just as free not to be protected, and not to pay tax, as he is to pay a tax, and be protected.<br /><br />But this theory of our government is wholly different from the practical fact. The fact is that the government, like a highwayman, says to a man: &quot;Your money, or your life.&quot; And many, if not most, taxes are paid under the compulsion of that threat.<br /><br />The government does not, indeed, waylay a man in a lonely place, spring upon him from the roadside, and, holding a pistol to his head, proceed to rifle his pockets. But the robbery is none the less a robbery on that account; and it is far more dastardly and shameful.<br /><br />The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit. He does not pretend to be anything but a robber. He has not acquired impudence enough to profess to be merely a &quot;protector,&quot; and that he takes men&#039;s money against their will, merely to enable him to &quot;protect&quot; those infatuated travellers, who feel perfectly able to protect themselves, or do not appreciate his peculiar system of protection. He is too sensible a man to make such professions as these. Furthermore, having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do. He does not persist in following you on the road, against your will; assuming to be your rightful &quot;sovereign,&quot; on account of the &quot;protection&quot; he affords you. He does not keep &quot;protecting&quot; you, by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do that; by robbing you of more money as often as he finds it for his interest or pleasure to do so; and by branding you as a rebel, a traitor, and an enemy to your country, and shooting you down without mercy, if you dispute his authority, or resist his demands. He is too much of a gentleman to be guilty of such impostures, and insults, and villainies as these. In short, he does not, in addition to robbing you, attempt to make you either his dupe or his slave.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
