				Almost any non commercial music but sometimes a good band hits the charts.<br /><br />I go to a lot of gigs of unknown bands just starting offf.<br /><br />I have no fav tune for drug use but I&#039;d say you cannot go wrong id 20 mates are back for a drinjk and smoke and you put on the Bob Marley album &#039;Uprising&#039;.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Anyone who objected, eject them for being impolite and disrespectful to our Bob.
