				I have experienced these things only twice as an adult, once on drugs and once without.<br /><br />The first was at a psytrance rave while on MDMA and LSD. I was watching myself and others dancing from about 5 metres above.<br /><br />The next time it happened was while sleeping in my own bedroom. I &quot;woke up&quot; and was floating above my bed and everything was kinda sparkling with a blue tinge. There was an entity sitting on the couch and I proceeded to conmunicate with it not through speaking but through thought. The being actually stayed in my room for a month and every night we would communicate. It was one if the most far out experiences of my life.<br /><br />I would like to know others views and experiences on this subject as its something I&#039;m keen to explore in more depth. Cheers!<br />

				It&#039;s happened to me 3 times, but never intentionally. Always while I was sleeping, and every time I found it difficult to get back into my body which was frustrating and terrifying.<br />I&#039;ve met other people who can do it and control it. I personally hope it never happens to me again. <br />I didn&#039;t see any beings during my experience. That&#039;s interesting. What kinds of things did you guys communicate about? <br />

				None of mine intentional either which makes me really wonder how or why it was happening.<br />The being I communicated with was very dark and it was during a dark time of my life which kinda makes sense. I have no idea what it&#039;s intentions were but basically I was asking it to leave and it didn&#039;t want to go. It eventually left after a month of me asking and getting more and more angry at it.<br /><br />Weird shit.

				The thing is, if u are experiencing this without practice and meditation, you guys are natural, that is really huge. They are a lot of ebooks on how to control and master Astral Projections, its a really powerfull technique, but be aware that could fuck up your mind, i mean that.<br />&nbsp;Ive tried a lot of times but never did it, its hard when u arent natural :(

				@MangoSeason<br />Can you explain something to me please? How do you live with a dark entity in your room for a month and not freak the fuck out. I would be out of there so fast you&#039;d see a smoke trail behind me like in the cartoons. <br /><br /><br />@donatto <br />I can totally see how that could fuck up your mind. I feel slightly traumatized by my experiences. <br />I imagine that an out of body experience is similar to how it must feel to be dead. Just a body-less soul wandering around. I don&#039;t see the fun in that. I prefer to be in my physical body in the physical world. <br />But if you really want to try it, I find that its more likely to happen if you are laying on your back. And if you have trouble meditating anti anxiety pills can help aid in that.

It wasn&#039;t until about the forth week that I got the confidence to stand up to it.

				I died a few months ago , they were able to bring me back and then I spent a week on life support. Anyway, for the 1st&nbsp; days on life support, my body wasn&#039;t responding at all, they didn&#039;t think id make it and told my family to prepare for the worst and If we believed in such things, to bring a priest in for last rights. Those 1st 3 days, I wasn&#039;t in my body. I distinctly remember being &quot;elsewhere&quot; I also remember returning and I know that the progress I started making on the 4eth day was because I returned to my body, which I remember doing. My last memory on the day I died was just feeling nauseous and going to lay down, I also remember, when I returned, being in a hospital room looking at myself hooked up to breathing machines and such. I didn&#039;t now I was in the hospital as I died at home so being in a hospital room looking at myself couldn&#039;t have been a dream or hallucination.&nbsp; It was a pretty fucked up experience.

				This has happened quite a few times ( enough that I can&#039;t tell you how many any more)<br /><br />&nbsp;Most recent was on LSD with my other half, GREAT fucking blotters, We both melted into each other and soared together.. It was most interesting when we described the exact same experience to a 3rd party with out speaking to each other about it first.

				@88fxstc I have a friend who experienced a similar thing. She od&#039;d and was looking down on herself watching the doctors working on her in the hospital. I&#039;ve heard a few stories like that over the years. <br />Do you remember making the decision to go back into your body, or did it just happen?<br />(Hope you&#039;re doing better now)<br />
