I&#039;ll submit it to the district attorney who then submits it to the grand jury, who will decide if they will indict him.&quot;<br /><br />A preliminary autopsy found the man, who has not yet been identified, &quot;died from blunt-force head and neck injuries.&quot;

				It&#039;s just a shame this guy will go down for murder for a few years... no doubt fucking up his, his wife&#039;s and his daughter&#039;s lives.<br /><br />Tbh if you catch someone molesting your daughter, I think it&#039;s fair fucking game that you kill them.<br /><br />But oh well, they be the laws

				He should have got an award. It&#039;s a perverse legal system that would even consider trying to prosecute someone for protecting their daughter. <br /><br />And they call us degenerates. Cunts.

				Note to self: If I ever catch anyone molesting my kids.. beat the shit out of them, call the fuzz. Wait til they&#039;re released from prison, then kill them.<br /><br />Justice is served, and no need to serve a prison sentence.

				I agree, I hope someone with a lot of excess money hires this man a stellar defense team to get him off. Would be a shame to convict the guy for giving a child molester what he deserved.

				There&#039;s no way a jury in Texas of all places is going to convict a man for standing up for his family. No way on earth. The district attorney will be under such huge political pressure he will drop the case.

				A few months back I saw this story about a guy in South America I think, someone raped his daughter, who was just a toddler. <br /><br />The dad hunted the guy down, cut his entire package off and shoved it in his mouth before killing him. The story came complete with a picture.

				I know in prison guys like this get &quot;syruped&quot;.<br /><br />Basically one dude boils some water in the kettle in his cell, and another pours in a few kilo bags of sugar (which you can buy from the prison canteen sheet). When you&#039;ve got the boiling syrup mixture, you wait until the dudes in the shower, then run in and throw it on his face. It literally sticks to his skin boiling it off and can&#039;t be washed off easily.<br /><br />It&#039;s great because it leaves no evidence behind, but leaves a permanent painful reminder on the guy for life, in a place where he can&#039;t hide it.

				Pedo&#039;s should be kept away for society.<br /><br />However, this story is a news report. It&#039;s bound to be twisted. And the Father could for example have used pedo as an excuse to bash his brains in.Maybe the &#039;pedo&#039; was being perfectly innocent? e.g. tickling the kids tummy..... this is like US death row cases... yeah hang them, but if you find them innocent afterwards, good luck to your society..<br /><br />Mr liberal

				Yup just read a few more reports.&nbsp; Apparently he was helping the rancher tend to horses and the dad walked in on him forcing himself on his daughter in the barn.&nbsp; He fought to get him off of her and bashed him on the head a few times.&nbsp; Then called the cops.<br /><br />He was pronounced dead and the girl was taken to the hospital and treated for her injuries.&nbsp; The dad isn&#039;t even in custody and no charges were filed.&nbsp; <br /><br />They technically could still press charges like they did in the Zimmerman case when they let him go but I doubt they will, due to the nature of this case.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s still hope left in humanity after all.

There is such a thing as being innocent accused as well as an innocent victim.<br /><br />In this case a man used force to prevent a crime in progress and in so doing accidentally ended a mans life. In a common law jurisdiction like the UK for instance his Mensus Rheus (latin for &quot;guilty mind&quot;) would not be the same as for someone who deliberately intended to murder and so it would be unlikely the Prosecution would seek a conviction on these lines.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know where the law stands in the US but certainly in several European countries including Britain the father would have had a duty of care towards his daughter so in fact it could be argued *failing&quot; to act as he did would in itself be illegal - it&#039;s called a crime of omission where I hail from.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a case of vigilante justice so much as a man using excessive force to prevent a crime in progress - I agree that we can&#039;t have people going around shooting and hanging alleged ne&#039;er do-wells right left and centre but in this case I don&#039;t think this man&#039;s got much to worry about legally. <br /><br />V.<br /><br />*Yes I know we&#039;re criminals but of a much better class!

No way on earth. The district attorney will be under such huge political pressure he will drop the case.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would have to agree. There was a case a number of years ago, involving a &quot;home defense&quot; type case, only this one was really fucked-up.&nbsp; <br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Hattori<br /><br />Yoshi Hattori&#039;s early life<br /><br />Born in Nagoya, Japan to Masaichi and Mieko Hattori, Yoshihiro was 16 years old when he went to Baton Rouge as part of the AFS student exchange program; he had also received a scholarship from the Morita Foundation for his trip. He was the middle child between a brother and a sister, and was described as a gregarious teen who played on his high school rugby team and loved fishing.<br /><br />Fatal incident<br /><br />Two months into his stay in the United States, he received an invitation, along with Webb Haymaker, his homestay brother, to a Halloween party organized for Japanese exchange students on October 17, 1992. Hattori went dressed in a tuxedo in imitation of John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever. Upon their arrival in the quiet working class neighborhood where the party was held, the boys mistook the Peairses&#039; residence for their intended destination due to the similarity of the address and the Halloween decorations on the outside of the house, and proceeded to step out of their car and walk to the front door. (Fujio 2004; Harper n.d.)<br /><br />Hattori and Haymaker rang the front doorbell but, seemingly receiving no response, began to walk back to their car. Meanwhile, inside the house, their arrival had not gone unnoticed. Bonnie Peairs had peered out the side door and saw them. Mrs. Peairs, startled, retreated inside, locked the door, and said to her husband, &quot;Rodney, get your gun.&quot; Hattori and Haymaker were walking to their car when the carport door was opened again, this time by Mr. Peairs. He was armed with a loaded and cocked .44 magnum revolver. He pointed it at Hattori, and yelled &quot;Freeze.&quot; Simultaneously, Hattori, likely thinking he said &quot;please,&quot; stepped back towards the house, saying &quot;We&#039;re here for the party.&quot; Haymaker, seeing the weapon, shouted after Hattori, but Peairs fired his weapon at point blank range at Hattori, hitting him in the chest, and then ran back inside. (Kernodle 2002; Fujio 2004; Harper n.d.) Haymaker rushed to Hattori, badly wounded and lying where he fell, on his back. Haymaker ran to the home next door to the Peairses&#039; house for help. Neither Mr. Peairs nor his wife came out of their house until the police arrived, about 40 minutes after the shooting. Mrs. Peairs shouted to a neighbor to &quot;go away&quot; when the neighbor called for help. One of the Peairses&#039; children later told police that her mother asked, &quot;Why did you shoot him?&quot;<br /><br />The shot had pierced the upper and lower lobes of Hattori&#039;s left lung, and exited through the area of the seventh rib; he died in the ambulance minutes later, from loss of blood.[1]<br />The criminal trial of Peairs<br /><br />Initially, the local police quickly questioned and released Peairs, and declined to charge him with any crime. They felt that &quot;Peairs had been within his rights in shooting the trespasser.&quot; [2] Only after the governor of Louisiana and the New Orleans Japan consul general protested, did Peairs get charged with manslaughter. Peairs&#039;s defense counsel&#039;s strategy consisted of a claim that Hattori had an &quot;extremely unusual manner of moving&quot;, one which any reasonable person would find &quot;scary&quot;, and emphasis on Peairs as an &quot;average Joe,&quot; a man just like the jury members&#039; neighbors, a man who &quot;liked sugar in his grits&quot;.[3]<br /><br />At the trial, Peairs testified about the moment just prior to the shooting: &quot;It was a person, coming from behind the car, moving real fast. At that point, I pointed the gun and hollered, &#039;Freeze!&#039; The person kept coming toward me, moving very erratically. At that time, I hollered for him to stop. He didn&#039;t; he kept moving forward. I remember him laughing. I was scared to death. This person was not gonna stop, he was gonna do harm to me.&quot; Peairs testified that he shot Yoshi once in the chest when the youth was about five feet away. &quot;I had no choice,&quot; he said. &quot;I want Yoshi&#039;s parents to understand that I&#039;m sorry for everything.&quot;<br /><br />District Attorney Doug Moreau concentrated on establishing that it had not been reasonable for Peairs, a 6-foot-2, well-armed man, to be so fearful of a polite, friendly, unarmed, 130-pound boy, who rang the doorbell, even if he walked toward him unexpectedly in the driveway, and that Peairs was not justified in using deadly force. Moreau stated, &quot;It started with the ringing of the doorbell. No masks, no disguises. People ringing doorbells are not attempting to make unlawful entry. They didn&#039;t walk to the back yard, they didn&#039;t start peeking in the windows.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You were safe and secure, weren&#039;t you?&quot; Moreau asked Peairs during his appearance before the grand jury. &quot;But you didn&#039;t call the police, did you?&quot;<br />&quot;No sir.&quot; Peairs said.<br />&quot;Did you hear anyone trying to break in the front door?&quot;<br />&quot;No sir.&quot;<br />&quot;Did you hear anyone trying to break in the carport door?&quot;<br />&quot;No sir.&quot;<br />&quot;And you were standing right there at the door, weren&#039;t you - with a big gun?&quot;<br />Peairs nodded.<br />&quot;I know you&#039;re sorry you killed him. You are sorry, aren&#039;t you?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br />&quot;But you did kill him, didn&#039;t you?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes sir.&quot;<br /><br />Peairs testified in a flat, toneless drawl, breaking into tears several times. A police detective testified that Peairs had said to him, &quot;Boy, I messed up; I made a mistake.&quot;<br /><br />The defense argued that Peairs was in large part reacting reasonably to his wife&#039;s panic. Peairs&#039;s wife testified for an hour describing the incident, during which she also broke into tears several times. &quot;He was coming real fast, and it just clicked in my mind that he was going to hurt us. I slammed the door and locked it. I took two steps into the living room, where Rod could see me and I could see him. I told him to get the gun.&quot; Peairs did not hesitate or question her, but instead went to retrieve a handgun with a laser sight that was stored in a suitcase in the bedroom, which he said &quot;was the easiest, most accessible gun to me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There was no thinking involved. I wish I could have thought. If I could have just thought,&quot; Mrs. Peairs said.[4]<br /><br />The trial lasted seven days. After the jurors deliberated for three and a quarter hours, Peairs was acquitted.<br />The civil trial<br /><br />In a later civil action (95 0144 (La.App. 1 Cir. 10/6/95), 662 So.2d 509), however, the court found Peairs liable to Hattori&#039;s parents for $650,000 in damages,[5] which they used to establish two charitable funds in their son&#039;s name; one to fund U.S. high school students wishing to visit Japan, and one to fund organizations that lobby for gun control.[6] The lawyers for Hattori&#039;s parents argued that the Peairses had behaved unreasonably: Bonnie Peairs had overreacted to the presence of the two teens outside her house; the Peairses had behaved unreasonably by not communicating with each other to convey what exactly the threat was; they had not taken the best path to safety—remaining inside the house and calling police; they had erred in taking offensive action rather than defensive action; and Rodney Peairs had used his firearm too quickly, without assessing the situation, using a warning shot, or shooting to wound. Furthermore, the much larger Peairs could likely very easily have subdued the short, slightly built teen. Contrary to Peairs&#039;s claim that Hattori was moving strangely and quickly towards him, forensic evidence demonstrates that Hattori was moving slowly, or not at all, and his arms were away from his body, indicating he was no threat. <br />Overall, a far greater show of force was used than was appropriate.[7] Out of the total compensation, only $100,000 has been paid by an insurance company.[8]<br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One of the many reasons I&#039;m pleased to live in a country where Firearms are illegal..! :-D<br /><br />V.

You cannot cure say homosexality because homosexuality isn&#039;t an illness, it&#039;s a personal preference which you have chosen for whatever reasons you have. There is no hope of correcting a pedophile because you cannot make them want to have sex with a man or a woman when they will always want to have sex with a girl or a boy. How can you solve a problem like this other than death or complete isolation? You cannot.

It&#039;s bound to be twisted. And the Father could for example have used pedo as an excuse to bash his brains in.Maybe the &#039;pedo&#039; was being perfectly innocent? e.g. tickling the kids tummy..</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow, that&#039;s exactly what I came here to post.<br /><br />Pedo or not, it&#039;s still a human life. While the atrocity of his (alleged) actions can&#039;t be understated, I think killing him crosses a line. In the father&#039;s shoes, it&#039;s likely that I would have done the same thing in the moment: accidentally shot him in the face (a couple dozen times), but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s the just (or legal) thing to do in the moment.<br /><br />I do believe the father will get off with the help of public support with a minimal sentence, if any at all. As a judge, that&#039;s what I would do. A precedent needs to be set that states: although pedophilia is not OK, murder is not OK in this circumstance either. It&#039;s a hot topic because different people disagree when murder is OK, and the biggest deciding factor of this case is its location.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No offense but it&#039;s statements like &quot;I think killing him crosses the line&quot; that give me the firm belief that people like myself were put on this earth to do the shit that people like you can&#039;t.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Props to you Lim - provided they&#039;ve had a fair trial and their guilt has been proven to the satisfaction of a jury, I would see it as a mercy killing compared to living life as a monster. <br /><br />Part of the problem is that not everyone&#039;s clear on what constitutes a paedophile. I would say it&#039;s someone who&#039;s attracted to prepubescent children i.e &lt;= 12 - the age of consent in the UK where you and I live is 16 so technically I would have broken the law if I&#039;d gone on holiday to the US with my last girlfriend and done anything with her - naturally we need a bit of common sense.<br /><br />Although it&#039;s not a legitimate sexual orientation paedophilia is one nonetheless. We&#039;ve spent decades trying to offer therapy, chemical castration, imprisonment in clinics, aggressive courses of medication to reduce their sex drive but we keep coming back to the same issue which is that it&#039;s a fundamental part of their sexuality - the only humane solution in my humble opinion is to keep them out of temptations way by making sure they never get into contact with children again.<br /><br />This may sound overly harsh but it&#039;s the only realistic solution to the problem as far as I can see. All comments are welcome of course!<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think the problem with pedophilia is that people deal with it as an illness rather than a sexual preference. You cannot cure say homosexality because homosexuality isn&#039;t an illness, it&#039;s a personal preference which you have chosen for whatever reasons you have. There is no hope of correcting a pedophile because you cannot make them want to have sex with a man or a woman when they will always want to have sex with a girl or a boy. How can you solve a problem like this other than death or complete isolation? You cannot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well said Lim +1,<br /><br />We cannot continue to believe this is an illness ; even if we don&#039;t understand it fully it&#039;s in these people&#039;s nature to harm children and nothing we&#039;ve done has had much of a measurable effect on it short of constant monitoring and/or imprisonment which is extremely costly or of course making it a capital offence to harm a child in that way.<br /><br />Of course paedophiles live in hopes that one day they&#039;ll be accepted and not be ostracised in the same way as homosexuals - all I can say is I wouldn&#039;t hold your breath!<br /><br />V.

When I first went to the Hidden Wiki I saw a guide on how to meet and have sex with children, suggesting five years old as a starting point ; it talked about ways to try and meet children. Fortunately they&#039;re easily preventable with a little judicious parenting and educating children not to speak to strangers but it left me to reflect on the kind of mind that would write such a guide as well as the kind of people who would put its teachings into practice.<br /><br />There&#039;s a huge difference between mob justice of the kind I&#039;ve read about on Housing Estates in the UK where people firebomb the homes of alleged sex offenders (and in one case a Pediatrician! - a few dyslexic people amongst the lynch mob it seems...) and executing someone as the result of due process in law after a fair trial.<br /><br />Naturally we need some common sense when it comes to teenagers having relationships with adults and I wouldn&#039;t execute a 23 year old man for having sex with a willing 15 year old girl for instance but when it comes to pre-adolescent children, it&#039;s just a matter of preventing further harm to say we should leave open the option of the death penalty in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Many thanks to everyone for a thought provoking discussion!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

This is the reason I am so anti-vigilante.&nbsp; It&#039;s just too damn easy to make a mistake and kill the wrong person. <br /><br />Even as far as the legal system goes, we&#039;ve had a fair number of wrongful convictions in this country: Truscott, Marshall, Milgaard, Morin, to name just a few. Truscott was convicted in the late 1950s of the rape and murder of Lynn Harper, a 12 year old classmate, on very dubious circumstantial evidence . He was originally sentenced to hang. About two years ago, he was fully exonerated. Marshall, Milgaard and Morin all spent decades in prison for murders they did not commit. In particular, Guy Paul Morin was targeted by police for the murder of&nbsp; his next-door neighbour&#039;s child, Christine Jessop, because he played the flute, and was considered &#039;weird&#039;. The police investigators developed tunnel vision, concentrating only on evidence which would prove Morin&#039;s guilt, and completely ignoring any and all exculpatory evidence (of which there was no shortage.) It was DNA evidence which eventually exonerated him. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah of course I agree with you there. Just to make it totally clear I would never go and do it unless I knew for certain and as I say I wouldn&#039;t go on some mad vigilante hunt or anything ridiculous like that. I mean that if a well known multiple offender moved onto my street or in the vicinity of my home PARTICULARLY IF I HAD CHILDREN I just would not allow it. There is no chance I would. Also for those that may raise the point &quot;Lim, how is it your right to dictate where x person lives&quot;. Actually IT IS EVERYONE&#039;S RIGHT to defend where they live against a threat even if the law says otherwise. You as a person don&#039;t have to tolerate anything that may cause you genuine harm, even if you have to attack it first. It just takes a pair of balls to be willing to put that into practice. I&#039;m not just talking about sex offenders either, I&#039;m talking about anyone who tries to harm you, steal from you or make you suffer in any way. And why the fuck should you? If you aren&#039;t infringing on another persons liberty then nobody has the right to take yours and you should do whatever it takes to defend your liberty and yourself by any means necessary. I get so tired of seeing societies attitude thinking that it&#039;s ok to be trod on or you are expected to take crap off someone. <br /><br />That shit is for the weak and the weak of mind.<br /><br />Oh and Guru nah man, don&#039;t be daft, was talking about someone else in a completely different thread. :)

				I wonder sometimes if there is something wrong with me, but the morality of murder means really little to me. It&#039;s not like I have the mindset of a serial killer, I just feel like the only thing preventing me from murder is the consequences from those actions. If someone does something to myself or my family that I feel justifies them being killed, then the consequences of the actions they chose is the likelihood that I will take the risk in carrying out their punishment. I would plan it to the best of my abilities to avoid the consequences of my actions, so I might wait months or a year just to ensure it doesn&#039;t come back to me, but I&#039;d have my revenge nonetheless.<br /><br />I&#039;m a rather emotionless person, as I&#039;ve been told many times before, and even fighting I&#039;ve never had an all encompassing rage, someone is aggressive towards me and I&#039;m rather quick to hit them before they hit me, it&#039;s not that I&#039;m a hothead ever looking for a fight, but I also don&#039;t back down from those types either. I feel I could easily kill someone I felt deserved it, and depending on the severity of what they did it would range from quick and clean to downright morbid like gutting a man alive - I don&#039;t feel I&#039;d have any hesitation or remorse, so I often wonder what&#039;s wrong with myself that I don&#039;t feel the same way as those around me.<br /><br />I always have a pistol in my car and another in my nightstand. I&#039;ve thankfully never had the need to use them for anything other than at the shooting range, but I feel comfortable enough with my moral compass to know when and when I shouldn&#039;t use them, but my moral compass also has plenty of gray areas that I wouldn&#039;t hesitate with and the majority of others would probably find ludicrous to kill someone over.<br /><br />For example, if someone tried to jack my car, there is a possibility they would leave me alone and only take my car which my insurance would take care of - I understand that side of the argument. But at the same time I know I couldn&#039;t do that and I will always protect what&#039;s mine, and the little regard I have towards human life means I wouldn&#039;t lose much sleep over putting a round in a car jackers skull.

				Whilst I wouldn&#039;t call it a happy ending exactly (I mean, we have a dead man and a child who&#039;s been molested), I can&#039;t say I have any strong feelings against the man&#039;s death... other than a slight niggling feeling at the back of my mind that a dead man can&#039;t tell his side of the story.

				To be sexually attracted to anything other than another sexually mature, intelligent human being close in age is morally wrong in my eyes. How anyone can think otherwise is just confusing. I may be being too sensitive in this matter, but hey...that&#039;s just me. :-\ Even an 80 year old man dating a 30-something year old woman is disgusting to me so whatever.

				Not sure if its a happy ending as the victim now has murder on his consciense. Even bad people who murder do have a metal struggle with it. Its sad that the legal system let the man down. <br /><br />We have to be careful though because false accusations ARE made and we have to be 100% certain.<br /><br />Thankfully most kids these days are more aware of sexual abuse. They know what is wrong and its easy for parents to explain that nobody can touch them in certain ways. <br /><br />Also - its not strangers doing most abuse its people you know.<br /><br />Keep an ever watchful eye on your children but bear in mind most guys would NEVER think of hurting a kid and our sexual leaning are to adults! <br /><br />As for rehabilitating a pedophile - could you rehabilitate someone who is heterosexual?<br /><br />You are what you are sexually. It will not change. If someone has children as part of a sexual preference then we can only rehabilitate by decimating them. Then the danger is gone. The dead do not abuse children. <br /><br />

				Yeah to be honest I find that hard to get my head around but yano, if you are a consenting adult and want to bang Grandma&#039;s minge then by all means carry on lol. What consenting adults do in their own private time is completely up to them, people have all sorts of weird kinks and you should absolutely be free to express those. The difference is that these kinks, save in the case of the rapist, are not predatory because people choose to engage in them. That&#039;s another thing I find so abhorrent when pedophiles claim they love children because it&#039;s a complete contradiction to pray on someone you love. <br /><br />And lol fuck having that nonce&#039;s death on your conscience! They should feel proud for doing the right thing.
