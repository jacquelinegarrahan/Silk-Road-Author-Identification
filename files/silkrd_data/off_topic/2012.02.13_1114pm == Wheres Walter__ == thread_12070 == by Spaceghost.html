				The two DMT vendors who I&#039;ve worked with (Elvis and MoonUnit) are both gone. I hate it because MoonUnit especially had some awesome deals. He was selling grams for 60 and now everyone&#039;s trying to sell 500mg for that. He did tell me he should be back but it hasn&#039;t happened yet. :( Moon did however say he&#039;d do 10g for $400. I don&#039;t have the need for that much DMT as only me and about 5 other people in this town will do it. Would anyone be up for a group buy? We could get a great price and not have to buy all that for ourselves.

				I&#039;ve messaged moon unit to see if he would be willing to do a group buy. If he responds positively then I&#039;ll set the thread up in the rumor mill or off topic. I&#039;ll make sure to come back to this thread and link it.

				Also looking for walter.&nbsp; My 1g of DMT from months and months ago is running low.&nbsp; If I&#039;d known I would&#039;ve bought much more.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually hesitant to even TRY DMT from another source.
