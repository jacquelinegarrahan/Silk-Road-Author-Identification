				that could get you enough weed for an evening or two, depending on who you buy from. I&#039;m mostly a ganja guy myself, so I can&#039;t speak for other substances, but 0.5btc can get you some quality stuff from some canadian vendors on sr.

				I always buy cannabis but when I have extra BTC I like to venture out to buy things that I wouldn&#039;t normally spend my money on.&nbsp; I recently went from 60-90$ because BTC went up a good bit last week, so i bought some strong tabs from jesusofrave to try them out.&nbsp; I also like to buy edibles mainly because they are great for to theme parks and getting high as hell without having to sneak things in... I guess it is just a matter of preference.
