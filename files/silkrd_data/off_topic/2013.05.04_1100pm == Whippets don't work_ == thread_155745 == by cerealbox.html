				I got all nostalgic about having nitrous as a kid so I bought a bunch of whippets, punch balloons and a nitrous cracker. Waited excitedly by the mail box, filled up a balloon, inhaled and... very minor buzz. Tried again and nothing. What gives? I can find very little info about it on the web. I looked up videos and I saw people inhaling and exhaling into the balloon. Tried that, it didn&#039;t do anything. What am I doing wrong?

				It used to effect me greatly, but now-a-days I don&#039;t get fits of giggles, just a minor cerebral buzz. Even after not using it for a while.

				Yeah the balloon method is definitely the way to go. I&#039;ve only done it once a long time ago and from what I remember that stuff got me pretty retarded for about 2 minutes. It was fun but not worth it. That stuff demolishes brain cells.

I think the trick is to have more than one balloon ready and to inhale a lot in a short period of time (with oxygen of course).

				Just went through four whippets. Kind of lame. What&#039;re the chances I can have someone on the silk road mail me a dental one? My own dentist can&#039;t seem to get one.

				I know there is a vendor here that sells filtering units to make auto grade nitrous safe. Btw how long are you holding it in? Have you tried doing double or triple balloons? The way i do it is fill a balloon up with two canisters, take as big a hit as possible, blow it back into the balloon, take a breath of fresh air, blow that out, hit the balloon again and repeat until the gas stops tasting sweet. Just to be clear nitrous oxide is perfectly safe if used responsible, its not going to &quot;degrade&quot; your brains cells lack of oxygen might but if you make sure you get plenty oxygen it doesn&#039;t matter.

				can&#039;t you just buy them from a cooking shop ? <br /><br />Even here in Aus they are available in quite a few places. Its quite funny actually.. A box of 12 is like $8 or so... then the guy in a small IGA supermarket figured out why the kids were buying them.. bastard jacked up the price for $25 for a box.
