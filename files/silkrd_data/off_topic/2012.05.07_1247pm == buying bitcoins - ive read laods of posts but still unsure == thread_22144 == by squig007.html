				ok, i use mtgox they arent really the fastest but works good for me. Create a account on there website but please note you have todo this from a clearnet connection (not by tor) if you do access your mtgox account by tor they get all pissy and might get you to provide ID to get your account unblocked.<br /><br />On mtgox under funding options you select the option for UK cash deposit. From this you will see the banking information needed. either copy and paste and print it off, save it on your phone or write it down. <br /><br />Be aware the last line aka the message is VERY important it allows them to put the money into your account.<br /><br />Next walk into a barclays branch hand the teller the banking details and say you would like to deposit XX amount into that account.<br /><br />(Ensure they enter the message aka your account number as the reference and note that it is case sensitive) <br /><br />From here it normally takes around 1-2 days for the money to show up in your account (mtgox is based in japan so the whole timezone thing is annoying)<br /><br />When you have your GBP on your account you then buy your BTC. From the interface its pretty self explanatory but you can change the price you want to purchase at depending if you want to wait longer for a better deal.<br /><br />Once you have your Coins on your account its time to mix them up so they cannot be traced back to your clearnet account.<br /><br />go to instawallet.org and save the url that is generated. This url is your wallet information if you lose it you cannot get back into that specific wallet and any coins in them are lost. copy the bitcoin address and head back onto mtgox and withdraw your coins to this address.<br /><br />Now open up your tor browser and head to (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) this is a service called bitcoin fog it bascily mixes up your coins so they cannot be traced back to one specific person. The amount of time this takes varies on your settings. transfer the coins from the instawallet to the wallet in bitcoin fog and enter the exit address as your SR coin address found under the account settings section.<br /><br />When the mixing process is done the coins transfer the coins to Silkroad and you should be set.<br /><br />Be advised transferring coins from one place to another will have a slight cost depending on the service so always deposit a bit more then you want to spend and that transfer times can take anywhere from a hour to&nbsp; 5-6.<br /><br />I suggest you get to grips with how the whole system works with a small amount say 5-10 pounds just to get some first hand experience before using larger amounts<br /><br />I was pretty stoned while righting this so apology&#039;s if there are any mistakes or if parts make little sense :)<br /><br /><br /><br />

This is good news for people like you who need BTC as I&#039;m only too happy to sell them to you for cash in the mail - the process is anonymous for both of us.<br /><br />The whole house of cards comes tumbling down if I don&#039;t deal fairly and honestly with people - when you&#039;re ready to buy some BTC please by all means message me in advance and I&#039;ll give you a quotation.<br /><br />V.
