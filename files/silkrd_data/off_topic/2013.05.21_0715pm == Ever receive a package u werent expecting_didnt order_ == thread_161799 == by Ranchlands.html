				so ive been waitin on a bit of h from a vendor for 2 weeks now and we werehoping that it would be here today. checked the mail when it came and got excited to see a packge from same area for me but when i opened it it was a gram of weed. now the only order for a g of weeed ive placed recently was from other side of country and i cancelled it due to no response. so im kinda confused as to where this package came from as it has my name on it but spelled wrong and none of the vendors ive ordered from recently carry weed I believe.

				Hmmm...<br /><br />This is indeed very strange. It is not a lost package that then miraculously got through because you never ordered it as you say, it is obviously not an error because it&#039;s impossible someone for an error took your real name (and misspelled as some users - IMO wrongly - do) and address precisely, seemingly not a gift because you say nobody knows about you and the SR.<br /><br />I can think of two cases, both of which not so good: the first (and more plausible) is that some vendor you&#039;ve ordered in the past has still your address and mistaken it for that of someone else in shipment; the second is that it is a trap somewhat.<br /><br />I would bet on the first case and I would not be so happy about it. You could try asking the vendors you made business with if they still have your address memorized somewhere but naturally it will be very difficult that someone of them in this case will admit &quot;yet, sure, we have it memorized&quot; openly, but at last maybe the fact you mentioned that you know it will be enough for him/her to cancel yourself from the list.<br /><br />Best of luck.
