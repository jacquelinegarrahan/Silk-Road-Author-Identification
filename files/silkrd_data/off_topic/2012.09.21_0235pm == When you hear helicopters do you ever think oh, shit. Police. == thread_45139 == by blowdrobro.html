				Hahahaha yes! I was just thinking bout this like two nights ago when I have been hearing helicopters way to much lately.&nbsp; Been hearing them like two nights in a row( but high in the sky).&nbsp; Still it is always at night so I figure it is either news or police copters scanning the ground.<br /><br />

				I dont know about you guys, but here in the uk some regions have &quot;drought warnings&quot; in &quot;severe&quot; warm weather conditions.&nbsp; This means hose-pipe bans.

				When I was 15 and used to sell hash to my mates and smoke it myself every day. I used to get so paranoid when I was walking alone, I used to think the police might be using Taxis as unmarked cars! ::) One day me and my mates were in a wood smoking joints when a helicopter began to circle overhead. Put it down to paranoia at first until we realized it WAS circling us! Followed us back to the main road where two police cars instantly intercepted us (we&#039;d thrown all our stuff). Turned out they were looking for someone else matching our description, so they let us go.<br /><br />Only other time as I grew older that I got so paranoid was smoking crack. That shit&#039;s the worst for paranoia, for some people. Doesn&#039;t effect all people like that though. I was a hardcore curtain twitcher on that shit! :o

No warning, just unload a full clip to the head. But they HAVE to have good intel on the target. The report on this incident showed that they&#039;d majorly fucked up with their intelligence gathering and identification of the suspected bomber, although 7/7 had recently happened I still don&#039;t think that excuses their sloppy work.<br /><br />I agree that UK police shouldn&#039;t be carrying guns (except the armed response ones). Not because they can&#039;t be trusted (although I wouldn&#039;t trust my life to one of them), more that I think it would just escalate the amount of violence and gun crime on the street. No one knows for sure it would, but most police officers think being armed would be a bad idea. I heard a statistic the other day that in the USA, for every police officer who is shot whilst on duty, one in ten of them is shot with their own gun!<br /><br />I&#039;m glad that over here we don&#039;t have a similar level of gun crime to the USA. The day the streets of London are like New York may be inevitable, I just hope there a long way off.

Helicopters are always a real fear. I guess now though the police are planning on stepping up their game and deploying drones with thermal imaging and cameras that record in 1080p. Lovely.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you are living in a european house, i dont think you have to worry so much about thermal imaging, it will just show the temperature of the wall, not the temperature of what is inside.<br />If you&#039;re living in an american &quot;house&quot; consisting of wooden planks, this is of course an entirely different issue.

If you are growing with any more than 1 x 600 HPS and you get a helicopter hovering over your house you have a fucking serious reason to get paranoid.
