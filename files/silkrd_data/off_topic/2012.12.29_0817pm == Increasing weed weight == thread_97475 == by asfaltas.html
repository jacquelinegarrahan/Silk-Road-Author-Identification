				Hello, my question is what do people do to increase the weight besides the magical spray which is being sold here. I know some people leave the weed in a bag with various fruit peels to give it some nice smell and extra weight from moisture which it absorbs.

				Put more weed in the bag to add more weight.&nbsp; No but seriously adding fruit peels will only work if the buds are insanely dry.

I&#039;ll admit I was talking about cutting SR coke with whatever to sell locally... but that&#039;s different to me. Very different. At least with cut coke you can find out easily if it&#039;s cut, but with bud that&#039;s sprayed most people don&#039;t know how to tell. A lot of people don&#039;t even know it exists.<br /><br />I nearly shit myself when I found out there was a spray like this... not surprised tho!

				hey its not like i have sprayed my weed before. i was mainly asking what kind of spray because i have heard from my old dealer (before i found out about silk road) of his dealer spraying plants with a little bit of pepsi and water so the buds appear to be a little more sticky ? i think this is stupid my self and if i ended up with a qp of shit like that i would definatly be pissed off. now spraying down 1 bud for someone because they keep bitching that all you have is shit weed when its good, is fine in my opinion.
