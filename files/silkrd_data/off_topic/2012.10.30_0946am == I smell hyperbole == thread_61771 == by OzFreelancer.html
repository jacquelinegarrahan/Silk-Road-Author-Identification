				If this guy honestly found what he said he found on here, he&#039;s a better investigative journalist than I&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />http://wordswithmeaning.org/special-you-know-nothing-of-the-internet-exploring-the-deep-web-confessions-from-an-investigator/#axzz2Aly9vRfk<br /><br />One part says:&nbsp; &quot;. As well as this there are literally gladiators who organise ways of fighting to death. I know how exaggerated this sounds – trust me, I’m the one trying to convince readers it is true – but there’s no joke to this claim.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve asked him for a link.&nbsp; ::)

				and...<br /><br />&quot;Some of this is quite scary, it almost gives the impression that authorities are not to blame when it comes to the evident existence of the child pornography that is stored within as the impression seems to be that those who snitch, are killed. Maybe this is all starting to sound like a Hollywood spy movie; but I am serious.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;:o<br />

				Very true.&nbsp; A big problem with both pro-bloggers and most media operations is that they&#039;re strictly for-profit operations.&nbsp; So any way they can get people to look at their stuff will drive up the advertising prices and hence their profits.&nbsp; It sets up a system that rewords being shocking and entertaining, as well as telling different market segments what they want to hear, regardless of the truth or overt news-worthiness of a story.&nbsp; Big headlines sell, while the overt lies get a 4 point font retraction that is ignored.&nbsp; <br /><br />You see this same type of hyperbole and exaggeration anytime there&#039;s something related to hacking in the news.

				&quot;Remember, whenever you have a dozen eggs, there is often a bad one and so I am not trying to state that ALL of the “Deep Web” is bad, but think of it this way: If these people need to stay anonymous in order to protect their livelihoods then there is a reason they must do so.&quot;<br /><br />The whole &quot;They must be criminals because they&#039;re using tor&quot;-mentality is sickening.

				And also openly admitting to intentionally seeking out child porn. Even if it is for journalistic reasons, that is still a crime in most places.
