				Naturally by my moniker it&#039;s obvious I am really into the darkwave or dreampop or ambient genre of pop music. Cocteau twins, Dead Can Dance, Bel Canto, My Bloody Valentine. Any other fans out there?<br /><br />I don&#039;t get Music from the Hearts of Space on the radio any longer where I live, and I miss it terribly. It&#039;s just too expensive for me to pay to listen on their website.<br /><br />Darkwave

				I&#039;m pretty open to most types of music (except country, just not something I can enjoy), like gtelop I don&#039;t know much about it but it seems alright. My personal genre of choice would be Hip-hop from the 80s-90s, can&#039;t stand whats going on today, the genre has completely changed (much like dubstep before it came to america :\)

				Okay I listened through the artists you mentioned. All very good. Will dig even deeper into this. I didn&#039;t realize first though that it was old, yeah &quot;old&quot;, music. Another artist I stumbled upon awhile ago is Grimes. It was labeled &quot;dreampop&quot;. Feels very dreamy indeed, but much different from this &quot;old&quot; stuff. Lot&#039;s more beat into it, modern computer stuff and the likes. Think you might appreciate it anyways.<br /><br />http://youtu.be/JtH68PJIQLE

				Haven&#039;t got to the eighties yet. Started out in early sixties and just worked my way to the seventies. Been to the ninties hip-hop for awhile. The eighties on other hand I haven&#039;t really yet experienced. Damn, there&#039;s too much music in this world. I&#039;ll have the rest of my life just exploooor-ooor.-oor-ing-ing-ing. *BLISS*

				If you&#039;re in the US Pandora is a great app, and depending on your morals, you can get a version on cydia (iPhone JB store) that allows you to skip the ads making it a virtually free personal sirius/xm radio. Only downside is that it sometimes plays music that has nothing to do with your taste besides a common name xD
