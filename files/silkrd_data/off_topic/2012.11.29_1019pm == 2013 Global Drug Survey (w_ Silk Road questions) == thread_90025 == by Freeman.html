				yes, but you can always answer saying you know of sr, but you never actually used it, someone you know did. there&#039;s many ways to go about answering their questions to help them out without actually incriminating yourself. i also don&#039;t really think answering questions on a anonymous survey would warrant enough evidence to allow a search warrant or something. you do however bring up a very good point gtgeorgz.

				I&#039;m not that paranoid.&nbsp; It&#039;s an anonymous survey over a secure site and you could do it from TOR if you were really worried.

				I wouldn&#039;t over-think this. It&#039;s nothing but a survey and if you wanna hide your IP then use a proxy or tor.<br /><br />These are the surveys that are used in all the statistics we read. Lots of news channels get the results.
