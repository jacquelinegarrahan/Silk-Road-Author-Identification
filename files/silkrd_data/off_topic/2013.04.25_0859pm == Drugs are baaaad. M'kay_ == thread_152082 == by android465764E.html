				I need more friends. Or at least more friends who like drugs. lol<br />Got myself 2.5g of something I don&#039;t want, and no-one I know will trade. The selfish bastards. lol<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ll swap you a couple of E&#039;s for a nugget of weed?&quot;, easy. Bosh. Done. <br /><br />But something more exotic? Blearghhh. If someone asks; &quot;what the fuck is that?&quot; then your probably talking to the wrong person. lol<br /><br />Urgh. Maybe someone should invent an anonymous swap shop. Noel Edmunds would do it..&nbsp; but only if Mr Blobby can be involved...

				I think a swap shop / meet is a cool idea.. Maybe DPR could make a section on SR for something along those lines..&nbsp; Not quite sure how to work that out but I&#039;m sure it could be done.&nbsp;

				Well with in the confines of the structure we have at hand.. (Being silk road.). <br /><br />I think the only way it could work ( with out coming up with a new system from scratch that is) would be to have a Vender work as the &quot;middle man&quot; or &quot;Match Maker&quot;<br /><br />How I could see this working and still being worth a venders time would be.. <br /><br />You submit what substance / items ect that you wish to trade and&nbsp; ... More or less based on the current market exchange price of the BTC <br /><br />A listing called &quot; The trading post&quot; could be set up on SR or maybe just a post here on the forum with all of the items / substances for trade... <br /><br />then when someone finds something on that list that they wish to trade for.. They can PM the vender with their offer and if its on the list that the person said that would be interested in go ahead and move forward or PM the person with the substance and see if they might be interested in what the other party has too offer. To stream line this for the vender it would be best if people could send in the most detailed list of what interests them ....( IE.. I have X amount of coke and I am ONLY interested in trading it for X amount of MDMA..)<br /><br />Once it is agreed that the trade would take place..&nbsp; A listing would be set up (plus SR fees, what ever they would be in this case) for each party to add to cart.. So the vender could charge a fee of like .05btc (more or less depending on the trading value at the time) for their part as the match maker. Once both parties check out, the vender would pgp the address of each party to each other.. and I would think that the vender would require FE to safe guard them self. <br /><br />a special feedback thread could then be set up for traders so you would know if people upheld their end of the deal or not.. <br /><br />I know its not prefect or with out risk but then nothing we do here on SR or in life is .. you can only mitigate the risk&nbsp; ;)<br />Just a thought it&#039;s all I have come up with so far..&nbsp;
