				So looking around this amazing place, I had a thought.<br /><br />Which of these drugs would result in the best sexytime with my significantly well-proportioned other?<br /><br />What drug have you had the best sexytime with?

However, if you only used a small dose and haven&#039;t been doing E too frequently, you can have a wonderful Orgasm +- 4-5 hours after you dropped the E.<br />The best Orgasms I&#039;ve had were on Diphenhydramine, don&#039;&#039;t use more than 100mg and start (masturbating/humping) 1 hour after you dropped it. VERY intense Orgasm, not really longer but much better :)

				The BEST drugs for sexytime?<br /><br />One that works on both men and women?<br /><br />2C-B, for sure. It&#039;s like MDMA but makes you both incredibly horny and last a long time, and have intensely powerful orgasms.<br /><br />After that Viagra, and after that MDMA.

				Has to be MDMA hands down combined with some Viagra and occasionally a few hits of speed just to prolong the session and bump up the intensity.<br /><br />Keen to throw in&nbsp; 2C-B (as i hear it can get you x-treme horny haha) but not keen on the whole hallucinogenic side of things but could be interesting and alright in a low dose i suppose&nbsp; ??? ;)

Colors seem brighter and patterns have a nice flowing motion but you don&#039;t see things that aren&#039;t there unless you take a huge dose. Personally I find it very gently visually and very enjoyable for sexytime.

				Sex and a mediumish (for me about 200ug) dose of LSD is just about my favorite thing in the world. Increases sensation, staying power and more or less eliminates my already very short refractory period. But the best part is the emotional intensity. Sex with the joy of a virgin and the desperation of a drowning man. OF course, you also have to not mind the weird flashes of insight, trippy thought loops, and general weirdness. I like higher doses with sex too, but I have a bad habit of getting weirded out or distracted and walking off, especially when I get into a weird thought loop about the nature of consent or some shit. Or I suddenly don&#039;t recognize my wife, which was kind of cool once I realized what was going on but freaked me the fuck out for a second. Still, when I can stay in the moment the orgasm is a lot like ego death. <br /><br />2c-b and sex are awesome, too. Just feels decadent and sort of languidly erotic. Anybody out there tried LSD and 2c-b together for sex? I&#039;m thinking of trying it out next time me and the strange lady have a free weekend together.<br /><br />

				Hmm quite a few but my latest favorite, low does of opium Tea - at the point it gives you a lot of energy and relaxes you, but not so much it dulls pleasure&nbsp; :-*

If she is on mdma/speed and you are on lsd it might get somewhat weird. It&#039;s an experience worth having for sure.<br /><br />Whats best really depends on what one is looking for, if you wanna experiment with your senses, go with lsd and other psychedelics. If you wanna get really horny and you are male, you need something that ups dopamine. Will give you boner. really hard. If you are female, I have no idea what to take. Dunno what makes you gals horny ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I heard that Methamphetamine works wonders regarding female orgasm. ;)
