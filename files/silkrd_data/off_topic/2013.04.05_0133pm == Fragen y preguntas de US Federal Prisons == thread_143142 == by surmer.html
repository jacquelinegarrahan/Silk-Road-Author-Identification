				Hello fellow Libertarians,<br /><br />Has anyone here experienced a federal prison sentence? What&#039;s the social atmosphere like? How brutal is it? I&#039;m training for triathlons now... how much will I have to fight? Honestly...<br /><br />I live by the fact that I might fuck up... as I am a fuck up. (Aren&#039;t we all?) Anyway, that old saying: <br /><br />If you can&#039;t do the time, don&#039;t live the life of liberty.

				you won&#039;t be able to do the time. jail sucks. especially in America. <br /><br />What they say is true. On your first day, either you kill someone, or you become someone&#039;s bitch. That&#039;s the only way to survive. <br /><br />If you&#039;ve never experienced life on the streets, then you will have no concept of the shit you will see in prison. Even if you have seen life on the streets, it&#039;s 10X worse than anything you&#039;ve ever seen. <br /><br />Stop training for the triathlon and start training for ultimate fighting...with shanks.

				I&#039;m great at making tools, so shanks will be no problem. I did MMA for a little while, but I kept hurting my knees in the judo style practices. OK... fight or die.<br /><br />Is solitary an option?

				It really really depends on what the crime is, and which one you get sent to.&nbsp; If you get sent to San Quentien.... yea, I would learn how to make a shank out of pages from a bible and dried feces.&nbsp; <br /><br />Had a friend that went to federal prison, and then got sent to that prisons version of &quot;the hole&quot;.&nbsp; They definitely said it wasn&#039;t fine living, but they had an opportunity to do yoga and (I kid you not) the food was great.&nbsp; Their opinion was the food was better than average so people wouldn&#039;t riot.&nbsp; Little interaction with other people.&nbsp; This wasn&#039;t everyones experience at that place.<br /><br />However, every story I have heard about russian prison puts the worst of US prisons to shame.&nbsp; I heard a story there are strains of tuberculosis within that evolve so fast, they stopped caring.

				OK I&#039;ll entertain you. I suggest you join a street gang in preparation to going to jail. Now of course joining a gang is not like joining an intramural basketball team. You will need to kill someone, or commit some other serious crime, to join a real gang. Once you join the gang, be a useful member of that gang. Teach them how to use SR. Then you must identify the leader, or an up and comer, and be that person&#039;s bitch. Always side with them, even if they are arguing that the moon is made of cheese. If you can accomplish these tasks before you go to jail, then when you get to jail, you will know how to join a gang and survive. Jail gangs are simply based on race. If you&#039;re white, you join the white gang on the first day. If you&#039;re black, you join the black gang. And again, when you join your jail gang, you will have to kill someone or commit some other serious offense like stuff a razor blade up your butt. Then, you can be a useful jail gang member. Again, teach them about SR. Then you find the leader and be his bitch. By this time you will be an old pro at being a gang member, and you might survive your prison sentence. If you are lucky enough to hook up with a street gang that also has a chapter in the jail gang, then you are living on easy street my incarcerated friend.

But as a practical matter, there will be a second in command of the gang ready to take over the top spot when you off the leader. Now he might do you a favor and let you be his bitch since you did him a favor and killed his rival, but you&#039;d still have to be someone&#039;s bitch. I think of all possibilities. That&#039;s what I do. That&#039;s why I&#039;m the consultant.
