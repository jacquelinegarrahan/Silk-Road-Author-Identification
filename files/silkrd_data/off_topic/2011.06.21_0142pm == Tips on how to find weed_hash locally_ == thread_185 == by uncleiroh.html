				Ok, so you move to a new country in a new continent.<br />You don&#039;t know anyone (except people from work who you can&#039;t ask about this stuff) and you barely speak their language.<br /><br />Then how do you find weed or hash?<br /><br />I really thought this was going to be easier =(<br /><br />SilkRoad&#039;s sellers are fine for now, but in the long term their prices are prohibitive since they are so much higher that the street prices.<br /><br />Do you guys from EU have any tips on how to find good stuff at a reasonable price?

				Yeah, I&#039;ve took a look at WeBeHigh<br /><br />In european cities the basic message on that site is &quot;try the african immigrants&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done that but no success&nbsp; :(

				If your in London just don&#039;t do the obvious thing and go to Camden to cold pick-up from a brother. It&#039;s always the pond weed from the canal wrapped up in cling-film. Everyone does it, and it seems so liberal and cool there.. You always get burned. Those guys make a killing from selling to un-suspecting kids and tourists.<br /><br />I suppose it&#039;s a coming of age thing.. Just don&#039;t do it. You&#039;ve been warned.

				Its hard if you don&#039;t know anyone local you just have to keep trying <br /><br />Local bars and clubs. Try and find people toking see if they know anyone selling. Around venues like Brixton academy or anywhere bands play. sure dodgy but you have to start some where. <br />There are a few people in bars here, north of London, that sell just keep an eye out you can tell quite easily though their sizes are always small.......<br /><br />Are you sure you cant ask anyone at work, that&#039;s where I have found most of my &quot;good friends&quot; I just cant imagine that no-one you work with smokes, or maybe that&#039;s just my experience.<br /><br />What about where you live, your neighbors. <br /><br />For a last resort walk round the streets until you smell weed find who&#039;s smoking it and ask where they got it from. <br /><br /><br /><br />good luck

				Get a part time job at a restaurant, shouldn&#039;t be to hard to find from there.&nbsp; Hang out at the park and look around for people smoking.&nbsp; Go to some concerts or festivals, easy to meet people there.&nbsp;

				Actually it couldn&#039;t be easier....I&#039;ve had to move with my job over the years and before SR I always had to find locally.&nbsp; Simply go to the local Craigslist and post an ad in the Rant section or something.&nbsp; Basically you need to tell the story you&#039;re looking for someone to help supply you with personal, small amounts of 420 for medical purposes.&nbsp; It helps with my back pain and it may do something for you like this also.&nbsp; Short and quick, but new to the area and looking for someone who might be able to help you to relieve some of the pain that 420 helps to heal.&nbsp; I hate to say it this way, but you have to play up the sympathy&nbsp; angle.<br /><br />Use a new email address and screen the responses pretty good - offer to smoke with them first, but I guarantee you will get numerous replies - some hate against drugs in general, a few that scream at you for being LE, but always a couple thrown in from genuine caring people looking to help someone in pain.&nbsp; I have done this countless times in countless cities and it always works.&nbsp; I usually try to pick out the most &quot;normal&quot; of the bunch and become a regular customer. <br /><br />Because you&#039;re initially looking for a smaller quantity and not hard drugs, and you&#039;ve made the story it&#039;s for medical reasons to help with pain , LE will leave something like that alone....
