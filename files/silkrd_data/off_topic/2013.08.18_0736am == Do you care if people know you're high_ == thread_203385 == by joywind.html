				Depends on what high. I&#039;m happier when I&#039;ve been smoking. That, they don&#039;t mind.<br /><br />When drinking I&#039;ve been known to commit felonies and be a general danger to society at large. That they do care about. ;)

				I used to care when I was getting high while still pretty young and being around certain people in my family because I didn&#039;t know how far they&#039;d take it if they found out I was getting high. It doesn&#039;t matter too much now though, I&#039;m even high as a kite around them sometimes and no one seems to mind. Other than that I never really cared about if people knew I was high or not, I&#039;ve pretty much gone anywhere that I&#039;ve ever been high at least once.

				Personally, I do not get high if I know i&#039;ll be interacting with anyone other than close friends, and then i&#039;d want them to be participating as well. I have no great desire to be high just for the hell of it everyday, so its generally a music conert or night out that I do and it does not matter then as everyone is high / drunk ;-)

				I care in the fact that im mentally paranoid that people think im high and in turn think badly of me, though this is usually after a being awake 35+ hours on stimulants so I do look a bit out of the norm<br /><br />however I don&#039;t do said drug anymore and the ones I do now aren&#039;t reallly noticeable<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t want to get high unless they&#039;re getting high too, feels weird, but that&#039;s just me. Other than that though... keep passing&nbsp; ;)

				If I&#039;m with friends I don&#039;t care because they kind of expect me to be doing weird shit at any given moment. If I&#039;m with completely strangers I don&#039;t care because They don&#039;t exist as far as my reality is concerned. I&#039;ll get sort of drunk around family, socially, but otherwise I&#039;d rather not be noticeably high around them. It&#039;s out of respect, I think. I hardly see them as it is, least I could do is be mentally present when I&#039;m around.<br /><br />All that said, I&#039;m a pro at pretending to be sober, so I can be high around anyone, I just have to adjust my behavior accordingly.

				I&#039;m not a weed smoker - it causes paranoia now.&nbsp; I gave up because the whole time I was thinking &quot;Can they tell I&#039;m high?&nbsp; Are they looking at me cuz I&#039;m high?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on what I&#039;m doing, I usually don&#039;t want it to be totally obvious that I&#039;m buzzing.&nbsp; It&#039;s like my own special secret.&nbsp; There&#039;s still such a public phobia/stigma over recreational drugs that professional people often form a negative opinion of someone who appears fucked up.&nbsp; Since I&#039;m a business man, I try to avoid drawing that attention.&nbsp; It&#039;s not because I PERSONALLY care what they think. It&#039;s that they&#039;re less likely to do business/invest with me if I appear fucked up.&nbsp;

				It can get uncomfortable for everyone if someone is a little out of control, including himself/herself. With the right setting and people i don&#039;t care much. Even if weirdness is happening. ^_^ As long as there are no idiots around. ;D
