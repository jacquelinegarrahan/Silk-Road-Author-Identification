				What was the best night (or day) of your life so far? I mean the best you have ever felt in a single moment!<br />And was it a drug related experience or not?<br />And lastly, is it sad if someones happiest moment of their life is a drug experience?<br /><br />I say this because when I was 15 I took my first E with some friends at our local bonfire night (UK). Hundreds of people in a local field with fairground rides, fireworks and a bonfire. Me and my mates got so fucked off one pill each (those were the days) we just went around finding people we knew from school, telling them how much we loved them and asking for hugs. Embaressing really, especially when we went back to school the next monday! The venue wasn&#039;t important, I&#039;ve never felt such sense of pure love and happyness with no sexual side to it. It was the best E I ever did, never got that same feeling again. At the time I remember thinking &quot;this feels better than winning the lottery, better than anything&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in love in the past, but I&#039;ve never had kids or got married, these things would probably trump my first E on a long term basis.<br />But, just thinking of that single night, that intense few hours, I&#039;m not sure I could feel much happier. There have been a few nights that come close, again they&#039;re all times I was on drugs. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I have lots of interests outside of taking drugs!<br /><br />Which leads me to my final point, because these are moments of induced artificial happyness, is that not a little sad? I&#039;m living my life for the experiences and I&#039;d hope that when I look back from my deathbed, the best moments of my life weren&#039;t just times I was on drugs. I&#039;d like to think that my first child being born or getting married would be the highlights. Moments involving other human beings, genuine accomplishments and things I can be proud of. Or does it not really matter? Thoughts anyone? And post your happiest moments, on drugs or not.&nbsp;

				The best moment in my life was the day I stood on the scales and realised I had lost 50 lbs in body weight.<br />I had set a target to lose weight. I tried and tried for years, but I used to go off track and forget about my diets.<br /><br />Eventually, I really put my mind to it and I lost the weight. I don&#039;t know where the motivation came from, but I was relentless in carrying out the diet I was on.<br />It was an amazing feeling to stand on the scales and realise I had accomplished the weight loss. I had battled the weight issue that had set my confidence back for so long, so it was the best feeling ever!<br /><br />

				when i learned to beat off as a youngster...jk... I have a lot of great drug experiences but I think the best moment of my life was reuniting with the love of my life after not seeing her for four years. We had such a wonderful bonding night and have not been apart ever since.

				Weirdly I don&#039;t remember my first E or my first line of coke (coke being my favorite drug), remember my first LSD tab tho (rolling stones) in a chaotic rock club... i found it amazing.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />One of the best moments of my sober life was quitting my depressing job that I&#039;d held for about 8 years. I did a lot of traveling around Europe over the preceding 2 years with no work, lived in Spain for a bit, went the gym a lot and got really fit.&nbsp; Was really happy until I ended up in another shit job.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Traveling is always an amazing experience for me, love being out of the UK and experiencing different cultures. Work, save, quit then travel... thats what makes me happy.

				Drugs are no more &quot;artificial&quot; happiness than anything else. Emotions are all based off of chemical reactions in the brain anyway. <br /><br />Take sex for example, your brain releases a shitload of oxytocin and that causes a sense of deep bonding. Taking ecstacy makes you brain release a shitload of seratonin, same thing really. What you felt was as real as any other experience you&#039;ve had, no need to cheapen it by calling it artificial.<br /><br />That said I don&#039;t really know what the single best moment of my life was. My first E is definitely up there too though, along with my first kiss, though the girl turned out to be a proper slutbag.
