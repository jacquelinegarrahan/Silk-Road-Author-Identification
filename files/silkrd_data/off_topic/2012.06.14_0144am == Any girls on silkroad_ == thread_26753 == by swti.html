				Haha, true. I just find it odd people assume that there isn&#039;t a decent population of girls here, and then knowing that why in the world someone would ask A) If there are girls here B) If someone is a girl C) The amount of girls. <br /><br />I mean, this is a anonymous community, so doesn&#039;t disclosing gender just help profile people more?

				Why does everyone always say it&#039;s so difficult to get onto Tor and use SR? All it took was 30 seconds of googling to find the right SR URL,&nbsp; and even less time to download and open the tor browser bundle.

You just download a file which is hardly breaking the bank in difficulty really. I mean really, from someone seeing an SR related article/news report it would probably take you 5 mins to get TOR downloaded, find SR and create an account. You could probably get your first buy under your belt in under 2 hours if ya wanted to. <br /><br />

Unlimited free hours + intense focus learning all this crap = a quick learning curve for me. Plus, I enjoy the thrill of learning about and participating in something as &quot;risky&quot; as this. I&#039;d venture a guess that not many other women are here simply because they don&#039;t care to learn how to do it themselves. (time, laziness, etc -- not because they can&#039;t figure it out) But if they did, it would still take less time than males because we are fabulous multitaskers, and we also don&#039;t need to take hour-long breaks for porn :)<br /><br />And hi Limetless, but I&#039;m afraid I have to tell you that I already have a fantastic bf ;)

				Everybody pretending to be a girl/woman here is a liar (or gay people who want to get laid off).<br />That&#039;s just plain evidence that it would be impossible for a woman to reach such a site.<br />Do you know that it would imply for them to use a computer? No way for their little monkeys&#039; brains...<br />But be careful, you were not so far from prentending that women could be clever or smart being, so next time, think twice before writing.<br />And everybody would have known if there were women here: they would be talking about fashion, shopping, babies and housework.<br />That would be obvious.

				I know of several girls on here personally, what&#039;s the big deal? It took me a few hours to figure out the bare requirements on how to make a successful purchase, so it&#039;s not like it&#039;ll be too difficult for anyone else to do so. Admittedly most girls are pretty dumb when it comes to using a computer for something other than facebook, but there are some smart chica&#039;s out there. ;)

				There&#039;s all kinds of listings for fake designer girly shit. Go look again. <br /><br />Christy, I have to be honest, I also assume there aren&#039;t many girls, here. Is it sexist? Maybe. Sorry. I even sometimes wonder if you&#039;re really a girl. And if you are, you&#039;re my type! Been searching for a woman who&#039;d let me do my thing for 20 some years.....if she not only let me, but HELPED me, you&#039;d lose me as a customer! lol. I quit growing when I moved to this tiny little shit hole, as it&#039;s too small to stay totally ninja. Someone eventually here&#039;s a fan, even muffled, and asks, &quot;What&#039;s that sound?&quot; My paranoia got to me, as well as lying. I hate lying. So, I had to quit. Good for you, bad for me...especially my pocketbook...as you&#039;ve seen how heavy my habit is! <br />I know there&#039;s female consumers here, but as for vendors, one has to always wonder. I personally think of most vendors as an entity, and not a sex. I imagine most vendors are a team, and not solo, although I know at least one solo. <br /><br />I also agree with the sadness in seeing such misogynistic posts. As a man in his mid-thirties, I have no issue admitting women are smarter than men. they think, while we just act. And if I made it here, and got coins, and made successful xactions, then ANYONE can. <br /><br />PriscillaMarie90 is definitely a girl, go check her pics on her review thread! A bit skinny for me...she like da meth...I liek the double bacon cheesebuger, but she&#039;s still sexy, surprised she hasn&#039;t chimed in on this. <br /><br />All that said....you ever need a fellow botanist in your life,let a honky know ;) I also grow shrooms, extract DMT, and can garden like a mad motherfucker. Gardening in my neck of the woods is a skill and a chore ;) Anywhere else is pure cake. <br />

				&nbsp;:P I also read a post where the average IQ here was something like 140, lmao. I&#039;m seeing more&nbsp; short bus, window licking, stereotyping, neanderthals here than I ever see on fb. I see people say things like, oh she couldn&#039;t be the person running the drugs, she&#039;s a mother and 45. How would she even set up an SR account, never mind find a contact. WTF?&nbsp; Girls who take drugs are less attractive than the average girl? How about the ones you meet might be, but after high school most girls who take drugs are not that obvious. I guess the Kate Moss type are, but come on what&#039;s your chance there. Lots of people can use a computer, people of all ages, male or female. What it takes to be able to get on a site like this is interest and curiousity. How many of your friends are afraid to go on here?&nbsp; I took my love of computers, my absolute fucking obsession with them, even though I didn&#039;t have one until my late 40&#039;s and ran with it. Anything I learned, I learned from searching relentlessly. I was hot when I was younger, but still manage to attract men, as much for my attitude as my looks. My interest in drugs is similar. I like to experiment. I even credit them with my non interest in alcohol. When I go out of this world, I would like it to be in my yard, part forest, part flowers, tripping away on a cloud of acid and an understanding family. I have been married to the same man for over 40 years, my children have been to university, I live this part of my life with their approval. I have an open mind which has kept me young and interested. I don&#039;t stereotype all people who take drugs. I know there are many reasons to take them. Once you realize that women are not a lesser copy of yourself you will attract women who compliment your life, not fight it. Be good to yourself first. The rest will follow.

				Of course girls take drugs too. Of course girls can figure out how to get the most out of the internet. It&#039;s not as common as it is for men but that does not mean it does not happen.<br /><br />Furthermore,<br /><br />This is a troll thread.<br /><br />End of discussion.

				Nice to see some intelligent women sticking up for themselves! Seriously, I was reading all the ridiculous sexist comments, which sound as if some prepubescent little fat-ass wrote them, just hoping for some women to get in here and take these idiots down a peg. The ladies just came out firing, kicking ass and taking names! Also, this argument about how only gross drugly nerd girls would be able to figure out silk road -- total bullshit. That rule holds just as true for men. It&#039;s not as if every male member here looks like George Clooney, I&#039;d bet some of them are hideous weirdos. Besides, I&#039;ve met a few really hot geeky girls, who at least used weed, sometimes even harder drugs too. Now I know for a fact they could all figure out Tor and SR the same way I did, by just reading some tutorials, YouTube, etc. I just wish this wasn&#039;t the anonymous marketplace so these smart beautiful women could post us some hot pictures! ;) Just kidding ladies!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />No but seriously, figure out a way to post some hot pics. &lt;3

				I bet there are lots of girls/Women/Ladies on SR.<br /><br />When I was dealing shrooms 90% of my clients were women between the age of 18 and 30. My experience is Women love shrooms!<br /><br />I have seen lots of posts on here asking about shrooms, where are they, where are the vendors for them, etc. Thus I conclude that there are plenty of girls/Women/Ladies on SR. <br /><br />Or a bunch of guys getting them for there GF&#039;s lol<br /><br />To be honest, dont care if the person is male, female, black, white, Hispanic, Chinese, TS, TV, TG, Dom, Sub, Slave, or gorean.<br /><br />Their bitcoin is all good!<br />

				I&#039;m a girl!&nbsp; :) and I believe this is the safest way for girls to get drugs - I hated chasing down a guy to find me weed because he would just be like, you smoke weed? Yes, I smoke weed.. And go to the gym, and shower, and go to uni, and go to work, and cook and fucking write for magazines. Meeting up with a seedy friend of a friend to get some MDMA for a weekend had just become to stressful, SR is one of the best things on the internet for safety and convenience.&nbsp; <br /><br />I unfortunately do not see any vendor giving up free samples for girls.. so i simply leave my tits inside my shirt. <br />Good day gentleman.

				Hey guys I found this really cool clearnet website that will satisfy all your cravings for pictures of tits and asses. IN FACT, it&#039;s even got MOTION PICTURES!&nbsp; :o<br />http://redtube.com/<br /><br />Thank me later. Seriously though, this thread was hilarious enough to read through all the way, although the misogynistic comments that weren&#039;t intended as sarcasm were lame.&nbsp; Ladies don&#039;t take offense from any of those fools; they don&#039;t deserve the pleasure of annoying you.

If you want good coke I&#039;d go for Pfandleiher, I hear his stuff is bomb.. bout £65 a G as well and its from germany so 2-4 days. There&#039;s other people coming straight out of UK but ime their stuff is street level<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Kap to be honest I stick to the kind of heels that would make me the same height as you - any higher and I walk around like I&#039;m drunk! I do enjoy my heels though - they make me feel sexy! :)<br /><br />Thanks for the rec I think I will go with Pfand - See lots of people like his stuff and it sounds great!<br /><br />Street stuff round here is about £40 to £50 for a g, and is really pony! You do it and then want to run for more, and climb the walls, when its gone you sleep all day the next day, and feel like crap! I used to pay £60 for some totally awesome, oily, clean, beautiful stuff until my contact went off the radar! I guess it&#039;s not what you know but who you know! The extra £15 is worth every penny! To be honest I felt like giving up on the ol&#039; blow until I found this place, now I have hope again!<br /><br />Thanks again! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Alright, well level is just about fine.. I guess :)<br /><br />Man.. you&#039;re lucky. Good Q street stuff round here is about £80.. And it&#039;s not a scratch on the stuff here. I guess it&#039;s not who you know, but who you blow ;) I definitely DIDN&#039;T just imply you&#039;re a crack whore. <br /><br />But I get the feeling I&#039;ll be seeing a lot of you around here anyway... But dang £50-60 street stuff? You must be from the North<br />

				yh yh i can get low grade for £35-40 a G(wouldn&#039;t entertain it), mid grade for £50 G, and high grade for £80 but you get 0.8g, so basically £100 G. I&#039;m in the west mids.<br /><br />I gotta say Pfandleiher is looking like the one to try at the mo!! good price £150 for 2.5g....was disappointed with the cloud surfer situation.<br /><br />welcome to all the girls here! I do see a few round n bout the forum but it is usually the guys who score aint it tho?? IRL also i&#039;d say but would be great to redress the balance!! :)

				+1 guy. Girls need to start scoring more. It aint right that we&#039;re expected to provide the drugs. Some know the score of course ;) But they&#039;re a rare breed<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26753.msg304131#msg304131">Quote from: TallTemptress on June 23, 2012, 12:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />It was £60 for a .7 sold as a g, that was up in the midlands - never complained about it was textbook blow, doing exactly what its meant to! Awesome, clean, bang tidy, quality! So about £85 for a full g, your right! :)<br /><br />No, I am down south, found someone recently who is doing a g (.8) for £40, average street crap though, blow it now suffer the consequences later! He always runs out, people like it because its the best they can get, for the best value. Brought a g for £50 the other day from another contact, I used to use regularly, but that was short and shit, he used to be okay until his &quot;friend&quot; got involved and messed it up for him and us... boo! Won&#039;t be using him again, given him too many chances, and wasted too much money. If I want to feel like crap the next day, I&#039;d rather hit myself on the head with a frying pan, I&#039;d feel the same the next day to being on his stuff, and save £50 too!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t these people understand we know what we&#039;re talking about?<br /><br />We are the privileged people who have experienced quality we don&#039;t want to compromise! And we know what we&#039;re talking about... so there!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Damn it! I can go into the Supermarket and buy a pint of milk, and its a pint of milk!

Wouldn&#039;t be as fun if there wasn&#039;t some ritual to it. But still... I don&#039;t mind going to some dodgy areas but I&#039;d prefer it if I got fucked in reward and didn&#039;t just end up with bleeding nostrils. Still street stuff you can still get fucked on and I guess if you couldn&#039;t at least do that these shit munchers wouldn&#039;t even be in business. As long as you feel a little buzz people will come back for more but as soon as you start baking cakes with your deals that&#039;s when people take a stand ;)<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t think they know. I think they&#039;re incredibly naive about how knowledgeable people actually are cause most people are just happy there&#039;s white powder in the bag. So they&#039;ll tell you its &quot;straight out of Colombia&quot; for example but after even a moment&#039;s glance you know its from Lidl&#039;s bakery aisle. <br /><br />But yeah it&#039;s all part of the fun and ultimately that&#039;s why there&#039;s silk road :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26753.msg304131#msg304131">Quote from: TallTemptress on June 23, 2012, 12:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">blow it now suffer the consequences later!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like my second wife ;)<br />

				These are just my personal opinions, no disrespect intended. To me, openly disclosing your gender doesn&#039;t really seem to have any benefits and it gives away a vital piece of information. <br />If the conversation you have to offer is only valuable because of your sex, than that&#039;s kind of sad.

I like to go to places, talk about stuff, share my thoughts on people, even engage in activities or show support while they compete in sports.&nbsp; Its not because of their sex, but what they have to offer. The conversations that take place are different. I like cooking, gardening, visiting shops and being just open and honest about everything. Though I understand your point of view I hope this doesn`t reflect on people who actually enjoy the company of women as friends. <br /><br />I didn`t say anything about vagina..I wouldn`t even care if someone was flat, its just the fun times I care about. I`ve been to karaoke countless times with my &#039;girlfriends&#039; (no pun intended), we sang RHCP songs all night and talked about our lives, the future. I really cherish those moments.

Going to get supplies is a macho thing?&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />It&#039;s would be nice to see both sexes represented here, just like everywhere else in the &quot;free&quot; world, and SR stands for freedom, so there should be the women here that comes with that! <br /><br />The male brain is wired differently from the female brain, that&#039;s a proven fact! I enjoy reading a balance of opinions to gain a fuller perspective of the world!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />SR should be the best place for women to score, it&#039;s very safe, anonymous, with none of the risks that come from the streets - Women should be loud and proud we are in the 21st century, it&#039;s time for equal equality everywhere!&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Elizabeth Stanton&nbsp; ;D

Its is because of the upbringing and environment that men tend to give &#039;special treatment&#039; to woman. Its all psychology and culture, I have some books somewhere on the topic, I might look or it later. Just like most girls are brought up to like/appreciate/recognize pink things. I have two sisters that were brought up like that, and they have a tendency to go for or like those things. Its not bad, but it strips the freedom to choose before you are even able to comprehend it. Some cultures including an African tribe work differently. The women only go out to hunt and protect the community, while the males cook and take care of the children.

				I&#039;m not interested in sleeping with a girl that I don&#039;t feel an intellectual and emotional connection to. Sex for the sake of sex feels like a hollow waste of time, a masturbatory act with a girl for a stroke toy.<br /><br />But then, I take acid for the same reason normal people take MDMA. For the reasons people take acid, I want to take a LOT of acid. I just need something deeper, more well rounded and balanced, or I feel like I could be spending my time better. (Though for simple therapy MDMA wins out over LSD, as LSD becomes over the top for the setting and sometimes works against it)<br /><br />Really, honestly, if a beautiful girl walked up to me and offered to either discuss my ideas regarding reality in depth with me all night cuddling with our clothes on or a night of physical passion, I&#039;d choose the spirituo-intellectual intimacy over the physical every damned time.<br /><br />As far as spending my time with a girl versus a guy, I find it much easier to be relaxed and open with my thoughts and feelings with girls than guys. I exhibit androgynous mannerisms myself, so it&#039;s only natural that I can open up more easily to the more emotionally open gender and not to the other. I realize that reasoning relies on stereotypes, but I grew up around stereotypes so it&#039;s valid for me.

My first ever drug was oxycodone, so this is quite a different experience. Yes, I feel like posting a lot! But the duration is quite short, isn&#039;t it? So sad&nbsp; :(
