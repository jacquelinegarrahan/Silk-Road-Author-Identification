				When I first joined this site, everyone was sort of family to each other and we were all trying to achieve one common goal together to be a part of a revolutionary team of expert drug users+ abusers + sellers + producers.<br /><br />Now, apparently, since my drug of choice is different than that of others, I&#039;m a no good dirty worthless addict.<br /><br />Really people?<br />Let&#039;s take a look at SCIENCE!<br /><br />Any chemical designed that serves to alter the mind/body is a drug.<br /><br />Caffeine or heroin, ALL OF IT IS A DRUG. So to think you are any better than ANYONE because maybe the drug you do isn&#039;t addicting or you haven&#039;t fallen to addiction to any drug (yet) does not make you special or better than anyone.<br /><br />I honestly do not get the amount of hatred and general lack of humanity that this site has nowadays. If you guys really want to improve this site, maybe you should have an attitude improvement and stop self loathing.<br /><br />Because seriously, if you have to bring someone down on the internet to make up for your lack of security with yourself, that&#039;s really really really sad and you look just as moronic as maybe I do with my addict tendencies. At least I openly admit that I have an issue while you shadow your insecurity with useless remarks on a hidden internet drug haven.<br /><br />/rant

				Hi. As you&#039;ll see in my reply to you on the other thread, I wasn&#039;t calling you worthless because you&#039;re an addict.<br /><br />No, it think it&#039;s more accurate to say that I was calling you an addict because you&#039;re worthless. Cheers! :)<br /><br />Oh, also? If we use the way you define &quot;drugs&quot; then caffeine, DMT, cocaine perhaps, psilocybin, THC of course, and many other things actually aren&#039;t drugs. It&#039;s because you said &quot;any chemical designed&quot;, see? Most drugs aren&#039;t designed, unless you believe the earth was created 6K years ago. Heroin is still a drug in your definition, though.

As you&#039;ll see in my reply to you on the other thread, I wasn&#039;t calling you worthless because you&#039;re an addict.<br /><br />No, it think it&#039;s more accurate to say that I was calling you an addict because you&#039;re worthless. Cheers! :)<br /><br />Oh, also? If we use the way you define &quot;drugs&quot; then caffeine, DMT, cocaine perhaps, psilocybin, THC of course, and many other things actually aren&#039;t drugs. It&#039;s because you said &quot;any chemical designed&quot;, see? Most drugs aren&#039;t designed, unless you believe the earth was created 6K years ago. Heroin is still a drug in your definition, though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />What the fuck are you talking about? Most PHARMACEUTICALS are designed in a laboratory regardless of their origin... (Yes, diacetyl morphine is derived from the natural opiate morphine but heroin was still DESIGNED as a more potent narcotic)<br /><br />The way I define drugs is the way drugs are defined you cum wad.<br /><br />All of the substances you listed were mind altering substances, you really do not know what you&#039;re talking about I think you just keep talking out of your ass in order to spite me and it really isn&#039;t working<br /><br />Now please, refrain from posting on my threads. It&#039;s cute how you&#039;re so utterly obsessed with me but I peacefully decline.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Pharmaceuticals are designed. Caffeine is not designed. Caffeine is a naturally occurring chemical. Like DMT, THC, psilocybin, and MANY others.

				That guy is a pretentious douchebag. No one chooses to be an addict. And if they did CHOOSE to be a drug addict, that is very very sad.

It&#039;s just that your addiction changes who you are, as well.<br /><br />The myth of the &quot;worthless addict&quot; persists because people, when they know they&#039;re addicted... take all steps necessary to escape their addiction and get back to regular operating function? No, wait. That&#039;s not a worthless addict, that&#039;s a regular human being who found himself unfortunately addicted.<br /><br />But you want free drugs to feed your addiction. That&#039;s what makes you worthless. :)<br /><br />See, addiction... you&#039;re right, it is a disease. And as with all diseases, CLEARLY the most intelligent way to go about handling your disease is to continue to feed it. Right? No wait, I&#039;m getting mixed up again.<br /><br />You aren&#039;t allowed to call addiction a disease, fucknugget. A disease is something you avoid or cure.

				Silk Road is the only place meth addicts, heroin addicts, pot heads, steroid users and cocaine addicts can sit and shoot the shit and be as open as they are about their drugs of choice.<br /><br /><br />to bat an eye at anyone for their drug of choice on a drug forum is laughable.

				<br />Yeah, fuck that, in terms of drugs, I straddle all camps. You&#039;re as likely to find me browsing for opiates as weed. I&#039;m highly inclusive when it comes to drugs. Ahoyhoyland is a libertarian secular state. I&#039;m the Martin Luther King of drugs, the Rosa Parks of Silk Road. I love all drugs of all shapes, sizes and colours (....except Ket which is fuckin shit).

				There is the odd bit of &#039;drug snobbery&#039; around, but there are also respected community members who use opiates.<br />It&#039;s not our choice of drugs that unites us, it&#039;s the belief in our right to choose whether we use drugs.<br />
