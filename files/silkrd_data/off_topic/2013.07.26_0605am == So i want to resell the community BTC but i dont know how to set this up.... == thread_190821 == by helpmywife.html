				I want this to be set up right. Now i understand nobody has a reason to trust me. Assuming you did this is my idea to help my situation and the communities.<br />I get coins daily from my source, I sell coins for 6%-12% above MtGox +Bitcoin Fog Fee.(depending on how you paying, and how many coins your buying) This way you get your coin anonymous it will leave anonymous :-). now the real Problem is that i cannot open a vendor account or i would have and would be giving away Narcan kits too#just sayin. Well if anyone has an idea lmk, thanks guys/gals.<br /><br />***THEIR WILL BE A DAILY LIMIT***<br /><br />reason i cant afford an account is i get the coins i dont have them, but i get them lower than anyone would believe.<br />this is 100% real so please real answers than can help.

And I know you are not saying you are ready...but the fact is that just because you have a desire to be one and you believe you have the coins to be one...even just selling coins takes a lot of knowledge and time and means...and you do not seem to have 2 of them. I think it is nice of you to want to help people get btc...but you would be in for a big surprise. <br /><br />I hope you understand what I am saying.<br /><br />And what is gumtree can you explain?
