				Personally, I usually take them at different times when combining the two.&nbsp; I like a 125mg dose of MDMA to start off with, and a 60-80mg dose of MDA an hour or two into the roll.&nbsp; This way, as I&#039;m peaking on the MDMA, I begin to feel the new effects of the MDA throughout the peak.&nbsp; I usually top myself off with another 50-60mg of MDMA later on in the night.&nbsp; This is definitely one of my favorite combos, despite the fact that MDA has been pretty hard to come by in comparison to MDMA.

				I usually do 80 mg mda and 80 mg mdma all in one gelcap or a parachute.....usually I just dip out of molly the rest of the night but that 50/50 bomb works great for a whole normal show.

				Its speedy....can&#039;t sleep on the stuff.&nbsp; You also get alot more visuals with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite as much of the loved up feeling as with mdma.

				I prefer taking MDMA then 2C-B later in the night. MDA doesn&#039;t do it for me.

I have only done MDA once on it&#039;&#039;s own and it is way more speedy but for me pure mdma is way to relaxing and if you mix it 50/50 with the mda you will get all the great loved up feeling and wanting to talk like you do from mdma but you will also get more sweaty and a push to dance, similar to amphetamines but without the jaw clenching and for me I have never had an issue sleeping on MDA as long as it was mixed with mdma.......the 2cx&#039;s are a different story when it comes to sleeping time for me. The stuff I got was also much whiter than the mdma I have come across. to me when you mix they two it seems almost like a 6 hour methylone dose but also has that magic that methylone is missing.

				thanks for all input,i think i will try the 50/50 or 60/40 combo. 70mg mda + 70mg mdma as first try...you said mda give lesser jaw chlenching? that would be awesome because from mdma alone my jaw has his own control :D
