				Funny story I wanted to share... So a friend of mine used to go around to gay clubs/bars and act as though he were interested in the guys their. He would find guys which were drug users and flirt with them, subsequently leading to them going back to their place to do drugs and fuck. However he never fucked them, but only do their drugs and leave. This caught up with him one night as he thought he was doing a giant line of cocaine, however he went deep into a K-hole as his A-hole got punished!! Needless to say, he stopped that hustle! Karma sure can creep up on people...

				Funny story.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />I could never handle the awkwardness of being in their place even to obtain drugs.<br /><br />One night a &quot;friend&quot; of mine convinced me to leave a bar I was at meet him up at some &quot;chicks&quot; place with a hot friend.&nbsp; I got there and immediately this &quot;chick&quot; brought me into one of the bedrooms and grabbed my dick.&nbsp; I was pretty drunk at the time so it took me a minute to figure out what was going on.&nbsp; Once I did I freaked the fuck out and ran as fast as I could.<br /><br />I have felt dirty ever since that night even though I didnt do anything.&nbsp; The &quot;chick&quot; grabbig my dick was enough. The friend swore he had no idea but I never spoke to him after the next day.&nbsp; Fucking sick lying scumbag.

				hahaha i&#039;m sorry, i feel bad for laughing, but that is pure k-karma for SURE!<br /><br />it&#039;s also funny because i remember when i was younger with my buddies (i think we just turned 18 or 19) and we&#039;d go to all these gay clubs and it was awesome!<br /><br />yes, because not only do they have a better music selection, but SO MANY GIRLS...my goood graciousness, i was pretty much doing my own thang and chicks would come left and right.&nbsp; And, the gay guys were chill too.. countless quick bump sessions and free drinks.<br /><br />I&#039;m not gay, and there&#039;s nothing wrong with it, but its just not my cup of tea.&nbsp; Guys were cool tho...but i kinda felt bad afterawhile. i mean these guys wanted to get some dick, would get me drinks ( i wasn&#039;t of age at the time) but to be fair, i&#039;d line them up and smoke them out with the dankest oil dabs they could have never thought of before.&nbsp; i was just trying to have a good night and get some poontang..lol<br /><br /><br />Yea wouldn&#039;t have guessed one of good places to get women than a gay bar.<br /><br /><br />i have yet to have some chick blow off my knobb....haha<br />i just see it gettin everywhere, but i dunno<br />
