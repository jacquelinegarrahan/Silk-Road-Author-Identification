				I&#039;ve been considering setting up my own botnet, purchasing a bitcoin miner virus that runs in the background, then spreading it/paying someone to spread it to 100-1000+ computers. <br /><br />Theoretically, I would get a lot of computers to mine stuff for me, and then they would send me bitcoins directly through a pool. <br /><br /><br />Has anyone on the SR ever done something like this? Any advise?<br /><br />Hit me up in a PM if you have or have any ideas/input<br /><br />Thanks

				have you ever mined for bitcoins on your PC? if you released a virus that did that it would be caught in seconds - mining for btc makes the PC heat up to the point where it would give you a sun tan and the CPU is at 100% constantly. it&#039;s just not undetectable at all. thats why people build rigs to do it<br />

				This sort of thing would get detected almost immediately. I mean, I don&#039;t do much mining anymore, but when I do, I still need to monitor temps and regulate fan speed. Even with a single gpu, you can HEAR that it mining based on the fan noise, not to mention you can easily tell when your gpu or CPU are under that sort of load.&nbsp; There are a few cases of people being caught after installing mining software on corporate computer systems, and the punishments were pretty intense iirc.&nbsp; Not saying that the botnets could be linked to you at all, but it would likely be a wasted amount of effort for the small amount of payout.

				It is very feasible to set a mining botnet up. But think of it ethically and morally. <br /><br />1. If you were to have 10-20-30k or more you could mining enough to deteriorate the BTC market. <br />2. Think of the computer you have the miner setup on... You&#039;re running up a single mothers electric bill which she can hardly afford anyway.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a cunt. If you&#039;re going to mine, make the investment and get a decent rig.<br /><br />Dank

				Don&#039;t even think to infect the networks i manage, i will catch you. But you are free to try if you want&nbsp; ;)

				I mine from my work computer when I&#039;m gone for the weekend. It generates about .25 btc per weekend, which obviously isn&#039;t a lot, but it&#039;s a nice store of spare change to loan people or use when I&#039;m just short on an order
