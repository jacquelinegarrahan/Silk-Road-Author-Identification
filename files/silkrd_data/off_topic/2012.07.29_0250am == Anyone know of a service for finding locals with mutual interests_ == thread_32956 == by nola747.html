				Back in the day I thought it&#039;d be funny to have something like &quot;drugbook&quot;...&nbsp; Now SR is kinda like that...&nbsp; The amazon of great cool underground things.<br /><br />But, basically, I recently relocated for my career, and I lost my H connection.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m building up good rep (good handful of successful orders, no refunds, no auto-finalizes, etc) on the site, but I&#039;m having trouble getting a solid H connection that ships on time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it acceptable on this forum, if you find someone who&#039;s in your same city, to communicate about making a connection?&nbsp; That&#039;s one of the hardest things... When you move somewhere new (for work/school/whatever) and have zero friends or at least zero that won&#039;t ostracize you if you mention hard drugs.&nbsp; Risky, for sure, but I think usually one can feel out whether another person&#039;s &quot;history&quot; of use is real or fabricated.<br /><br />There should be something like match.com for responsible, non-sketchy, professional drug users.
