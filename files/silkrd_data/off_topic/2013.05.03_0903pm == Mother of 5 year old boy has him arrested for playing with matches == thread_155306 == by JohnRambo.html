				Words fail me. All I will say is this. The science of physics has proven that there is an equal and opposite reaction to every action.<br /><br />Do you women even realize the social backlash against your misandry that is coming?<br /><br />http://www.circleofmoms.com/parenting-debates-hot-topics/mother-has-5-year-old-son-arrested-552114<br /><br />The sickest part of all? OTHER WOMEN agree with this. Look at the comments section. Many women agree with the mother for doing this. In other words, other women are JUST AS BAD as the mother herself and fully condone such horrible actions towards young boys.<br /><br />Do you women even realize the social backlash that is coming when the generations of young boys that you hated on and abused grow up? How do you think they are going to treat women, since you women have been treating them like shit their whole lives?<br /><br />I think the world in the movie A Clockwork Orange is going to be very very tame by comparison to what is coming.<br />

				Like I said in the other thread, it seems that American women WANT to turn their sons into alpha males so that they can then henpeck them and have an unlimited supply of sex. I think a LOT of these single mothers have incest fantasies about their own sons. Maybe that&#039;s one reason why they get rid of the father, so that the mother can keep the son as a sex slave.
