				Okay, here’s the story on how I’m making some pretty good profit thanks to Silk Road.<br /><br />I live in the UK (I won’t disclose what part, even what end of the country) and I am 17 years old, currently still attending school.<br /><br />In my area, of the people my friends and I know, the prices for weed are terrible. All the bud is hydro but generally you’ll get about a gram of weed for £20.<br /><br />I recently purchased 2Ozs of weed from Silk Road which cost me a total of about £170. This weighed in at 60g when it arrived and I have split that up into 60 1g bags.<br /><br />In school I have spread the word among a few different groups notorious to be smoking a lot of weed. I only deal during school so I don’t waste my time going to meet people, but many people approach me asking to buy some stuff.<br /><br />In three days I’ve sold 30/60 bags for a total of £600 and I still have the other half to sell. This way when I finish selling this stuff I’ll have made a turnover of £1200 and a NET profit of £1030 – not bad money for clicking an order button online, spending a few minutes dividing some stuff into bags, and handing a couple bags to people when they approach me in school.<br /><br />I am currently considering buying 6Ozs, selling that and then buying a pound of proper amazing hydro or something. If I did buy a pound and sell it on I’d make a NET profit of £15,160.<br /><br />So thank you, Silk Road. You’re enabling me to earn a lot of money.

				Way to go kid, some reporter or journalist has probably got a erection reading this post.<br /><br />Did you really have to mention you were dealing in school?, having said that a gram for £20 is fucking dire, you must live in some hick town , even in the worst places in london it&#039;s £20 @ 1.4.<br /><br />also you shouldn&#039;t be dealing ON school property as when someone snitches (which they inevitably will) your fucked, keep all trades OUT of school property...

That&#039;s how it was in my town, because generally white people were rich. I&#039;m white, and I acknowledge that. If you disagree you grew up in a much different place then I. Anyone who started out poor and is now upper middle class, or even rich, knows that the quality of people at the poor level is higher. Its like a family. Rich people are only out for themselves. Rich people tend to be white, poor people tend to be black. That isn&#039;t racism. Those are facts. Sorry If I hurt any rich white peoples feelings, what I said doesn&#039;t necessarily apply to you. As a drug dealer you HAVE to profile every potential buyer.

				yeah, everyone i went to school with knew better than bring drugs to school. they&#039;d always have those drug dogs come into our classrooms and sniff our bookbags for drugs. They even send the dogs out to the parking lots to sniff vehicles. One kid got in trouble because there was an old roach in his trunk or something.

				Try not to deal in school, just take orders in school and meet in the park after school. There is a hefty price to pay dealing in school zones here in America....So be careful kid...

				..... Dear, OP <br /><br />The first Rule of Silk Road is you NEVER talk about SILK ROAD!<br /><br />For you to start a thread like this, it is obvious you will not be able to stop yourself from mouthing off to people about &quot;this really cool website where you can buy drugs and they mail them right to your house!&quot;.<br /><br />And, then with our luck, you will tell people how to find SR.<br /><br />KYS.

I am from an area that people would honestly consider one of the worst cities in America in many ways, I won&#039;t go into details because it would be easy to figure out, but my experiences have been almost the complete opposite of yours. <br /><br />My experience is that the rich, typically white kids were always the professional bunch, willing to pay more not only because they had more money but because it was harder for them to find product. This tended to lead to a more respectable/reliable clientele who acted that way in order to maintain good relations with a dealer. <br /><br />On the other hand those in the hood/ghetto were much more shady and always looking for a way to get one over on you.&nbsp; Seeing as all you need to do is shout in these types of neighborhoods to find someone with weed it wasn&#039;t necessary to maintain good relationships since there was always someone else to go to. Another reason I am skeptical of your statements is from my experience virtually no one in the ghetto/hood smokes good weed, it was always dirty cheap weed or mids at best, I can&#039;t tell you how many times I matched someone in these neighborhoods a blunt only to find they rolled one up skinnier then a toothpick with something like .5 gram of actual dirty weed in the blunt...that is how cheap people are around my &#039;hood&#039;. <br /><br />Anyways just a quick socioeconomic analysis of weed dealing in my city, I could probably write a research paper on the subject.&nbsp; Of course there are always exceptions to these generalizations and as with any good business, dealing with a good clientele is crucial and unfortunately there will always bad apples that you need to weed out, you just gotta catch them before they get one over on you.<br /><br />

				interesting points from doublemint and nexus68...just thought I&#039;d give my 2 cents/pence...<br /><br />for re-upping/supplies ALWAYS get weed from the hood, in my experience the most run down, grimy areas have the STRONGEST, POWERFUL, THC packed chronic and way better prices..<br /><br />BUT I would never ever sell in the &quot;hood&quot; too much drama, stabbings, bollocks and robberies..I can&#039;t be arsed with all the street politics and drama..and there&#039;s always extra heat from cops/undercovers = just not worth it. <br /><br />always best to get your re-up then leave. have done big deals in the past, always carried pepper spray for protection 1 vs 1 is fine, but when supplying gangs or 2+ people no matter how hard you think you are you still don&#039;t want ANY risk of getting your shit took...<br /><br />also didn&#039;t want to be affiliated with gangs as they slow you down (don&#039;t want anyone leeching off my profits/supply and there&#039;s no such thing as honor or a &quot;street code&quot; it&#039;s all bullshit)<br /><br />back in the day...for me at least it was ALWAYS about selling to the fellow average white kids, most of the time their dealers are absolutely CRAP...used to find out what their current dealer was charging them (e.g 1.6g @ £20 of damp weed!).<br /><br />this was a while back but back then you could get 4.5oz @ £650 of chronic if you knew the right people, so I saved up just over half the money I needed...got the rest of the on tick...sold £10/g of high quality chronic strains like blueberry, amnesia haze, cheese, ak47 and that stuff sold QUICK...people were telling friends e.t.c on a &quot;average week&quot; made £600/every 2 weeks (About $950) profit ..<br /><br />if the average people were going to snitch it was going to be on all the shit dealers they had...they would never snitch on their best dealers as they knew they wouldn&#039;t find a better hookup so they&#039;d be shooting themselves in the foot..<br /><br />don&#039;t even get me started on uni...things went to a even bigger scale with campus accomodation..year one I was living in shitty halls like everyone else..1 year later dealing paid for my tuition fees, rent for a much nicer flat, internet, gas, water, electric, eating out, trips to amsterdam once a month...<br />

It&#039;s not a question of color, its a question of class. Lower class communitys are tighter than high ones. I was only robbed once, and it was for an 1/8th. <br />It was when I first started selling, so I wasn&#039;t being smart. He was with two others, I handed him the weed and he handed me like $5. I said what the fuck man you gonna do me like this? He said what you wanna fight about it? I said yeah, and I fought. I lost against the three of them but I got my respect. The next day I fought the one that I handed it to to &quot;Bury it,&quot; and won. After that everyone knew and respected me. <br /><br />If you&#039;re a bitch yeah you probably wont be able to sell in the hood because they&#039;ll rob you, and you wont do shit. But if you&#039;ve got balls, it&#039;ll keep you from getting snitched on from rich kids.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I honestly cannot tell if you are trying to act hard or telling the truth and just have a grudge against certain people. I am from an area that people would honestly consider one of the worst cities in America in many ways, I won&#039;t go into details because it would be easy to figure out, but my experiences have been almost the complete opposite of yours. <br /><br />My experience is that the rich, typically white kids were always the professional bunch, willing to pay more not only because they had more money but because it was harder for them to find product. This tended to lead to a more respectable/reliable clientele who acted that way in order to maintain good relations with a dealer. <br /><br />On the other hand those in the hood/ghetto were much more shady and always looking for a way to get one over on you.&nbsp; Seeing as all you need to do is shout in these types of neighborhoods to find someone with weed it wasn&#039;t necessary to maintain good relationships since there was always someone else to go to. Another reason I am skeptical of your statements is from my experience virtually no one in the ghetto/hood smokes good weed, it was always dirty cheap weed or mids at best, I can&#039;t tell you how many times I matched someone in these neighborhoods a blunt only to find they rolled one up skinnier then a toothpick with something like .5 gram of actual dirty weed in the blunt...that is how cheap people are around my &#039;hood&#039;. <br /><br />Anyways just a quick socioeconomic analysis of weed dealing in my city, I could probably write a research paper on the subject.&nbsp; Of course there are always exceptions to these generalizations and as with any good business, dealing with a good clientele is crucial and unfortunately there will always bad apples that you need to weed out, you just gotta catch them before they get one over on you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, you lived in the real ghetto. I grew up in the projects, but it wasn&#039;t a top 10 city or anything. , The rich kids couldn&#039;t get any good weed because nobody would sell to them. When I first started out, I was basically the leazon or however you spell that. Then some kids got busted and my name came out. They couldn&#039;t prove anything but from then on I was constantly harassed by the police. I outsmarted them, and layed low, etc etc. I even was searched with bud on me one time, had it in a cut out part of my shoe. Got away with it.<br />After it calmed down I began to sell to mostly black people (You know, people in the projects. A few whites too), and they appreciated me so much. Some of the people I would of never of associated with would offer to smoke me out on weed I sold them. Maybe that&#039;s not how all communities are, but damnit that was how mine was. All my dimes were fat. (Thats basically the only thing people smoke, .5&#039;s for $10) I would give .7&#039;s and .8&#039;s. While all of the other dealers would give skimp bags, .4s .5s. <br />&nbsp;<br />Only one person in town had regs, so that wasn&#039;t an option for most. All of our bud came in from a 2 hour drive to one of the murder capitals, and only the best was brought back. I personally never made the trip. We had no gangs either. Come to think of it, my town was probably an isolated case. <br /><br />Edit: Once again, when I say I wouldn&#039;t sell to white people I mean the rich ones. Basically, If you didn&#039;t live downtown (Where our hood was) you weren&#039;t buying shit from me unless someone I trust told me otherwise. <br />

				Jesus man, why the hell would you sell in school? Yeah it&#039;s convenient, but a school is not the right place to be selling drugs. Maybe to close friends it&#039;s okay, but to make it your business is a bad idea. And you said you&#039;re from the UK? I want you to know I fucking HATE chavs.
