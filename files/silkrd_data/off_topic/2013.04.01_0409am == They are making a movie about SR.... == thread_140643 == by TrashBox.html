				I was actually thinking of how good of a movie it would be. If i was personally directing it, it would be a fantastic film. :P<br /><br />But of course we would not want a movie about SR ever to come out..maybe it will when all drugs are legalized and we will look back and laugh at how much effort we all went to.. :)

				i&#039;ve never seen twilight or read it or you know gone anywhere near it but i saw her on a chat show (graham norton) and she was the second dullest guest he&#039;s ever had (first being usher) and she wouldn&#039;t crack a smile for shit. she was promoting that snow white movie and just had fuck all to say about anything she just seemed really pissed off at having to be there. just the least charismatic public persona i guess, came across cold as ice.

I know it&#039;s the fucking terrible writing, but ughhh. she should have turned down the role. I would rather see her as the lame chick in 50 shades. at least then I get to see her tied up and punished a bit (i have only seen the first twilight movie, so maybe i missed the hot sex scenes?).

				fuckingACE- ***EDIT***Ray Liotta<br />--- This was hard, almost chose a&nbsp; younger Al Pacino or Robert De Niro<br /><br />TrashBox- January Jones<br />BlueGiraffe- Aaron Paul<br />PrincessHIGH- Emma Watson<br /><br />KitKat82- Emma stone<br />RonSwanson- Benedict Cumberbatch<br /><br />Storyline:<br /><br />BlueGiraffe (Aaron Paul) is a up and coming American dealer in the streets of Madrid, the reason he was forced to move to Spain was due to the fact that his fiance PrincessHIGH(Emma Watson) innocently shot and killed an corrupt American police officer who was attempting to blackmail and extort her man, BlueGiraffe (Aaron Paul). PrincessHIGH is a very innocent girl who could not help but fall for the badboy ways of of her man. Eventually she ended up deeper in the game then she would ever imagine. The officer knew of his dealing in California and threatened their lives if they did not pay thousands to him each month. One day when the officer became to0 hostile with her man PrincessHIGH pulled the trigger and they fled the nation on what little they had left. <br /><br />Hot on their trail is a private investigator RonSwanson (Benedict Cumberbatch) who was hired by the murdered cops wife. He has traced them to Madrid and is closing in to detain them and extraditing them to the US for prosecution. He has is own troubles however struggling with a terrible case of glaucoma, which causes his character to smoke hella buds. (unrelated) However, he might just end up saving BlueGirrafe&#039;s life. <br /><br />Little does BlueGiraffe know he is impeding on someones territory who is much bigger than himself....<br /><br />fuckingACE (Ray Liotta), Has ran the drug game in the streets of Madrid successfully for over two decades. His family controls the police and drug trade throughout all of central Spain and he doesn&#039;t appreciate the new guy in town (BlueGirrafe) taking all of his clients. His stunning wife, TrashBox (January Jones) is just as corrupt as he is, her family has political ties in Spain that make the pair of them untouchable. Don&#039;t let her looks fool you, as she enjoys taking out the trash... (no pun intended) Together they are truly a modern day Bonnie and Clyde but with a classy touch...<br /><br />KitKat82 (Emma Stone) is a local rager. She likes to have a great time and enjoy drugs while doing so. She happens to cross paths with PrincessHIGH and BlueGiraffe &amp; just so happens to introduce them to the scene in Madrid. She plays a vital role in keeping the pair safe from the investigator as well as the evil drug kingpin duo!<br /><br />Stay tuned for more to come!<br /><br />&nbsp;Haha damn, not too shabby!<br /><br /><br />
