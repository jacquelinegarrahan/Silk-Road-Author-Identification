				Not to brag or anything. But, I took a chance on the bitcoin when&nbsp; it was sub 7 bucks a piece.(even though my wife didn&#039;t like the idea) Soi far, Ive made 30 plus percent on a good chunk of money. This is why when it dips like it did its a good reason to buy, buy buy!!! Im going to sell only the original investiment at the rate that it is now (above 10) and keep my profit in btc. I know it could go higher, but ill take my profit and risk that, lol..<br /><br />I still dont like how volatile it is, but when it gets that low from being in the teens.. you know its going to recover most of the way..(at least temporarily)

				The market is still too small for stability. <br /><br />You have done well with your market timing.<br /><br /><br />The general rule of thumb is that you can make a small fortune in any high risk venture (fish-farming, bitcoin speculation, real estate) *<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />* Provided that you start with a large fortune.<br /><br /><br /><br />SB

				Congrats CP, you certainly called it. I&#039;m glad I restocked on BTC when they were at $7 as well. Now I will essentially only be paying 70% the actual listing cost of drugs for a while - so hurry up and get those Opana before the BTC go back down to $6!

				I bought in at 7.71. 7 is much better, I thought about it. I quickly recouped my original investment and now am hording til 13.5 again. Hopefully real soon. Then I will hoard again...

				I did the same when it dropped. I took the risk with the remainder of my cash after the myshitcoin.com fiasco and spent the rest on BTC at the low. Now only 3 days later the BTC rate is back up &amp; 49% if the lost BTC have been returned. Things always work for the best when faith is kept strong &amp; energy is focused in a positive direction. Congratulations everyone that benefited from the seemingly horrible situation :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-
