				I&#039;m reading &quot;Acid Dreams&quot;, an excellent book that chronicles the entire history of LSD, from its synthesis in Switzerland, to its use by the CIA in mind control experiments, to the &#039;60s counterculture. Everyone interested in drugs or even altered states of mind in general should definitely check it out.

The Emperor&#039;s son who took over the control of the country after his father&#039;s worldwide exploration became xenophobic and destroyed most (but not all) evidence of the journey. <br /><br />Very interesting.

				Shantaram - Gregory David Roberts<br /><br />This story is incredible, it&#039;s about an Aussie junkie/bank robber that escapes a max security prison and lives in India for 8 years as a fugitive, joined the Indian mafia, lived in the slums and set up a free clinic for the slum-dwellers. It&#039;s over 900 pages but I finished it in about a week, couldn&#039;t put it down.

Amazing story! I know it&#039;s based on real life but I wonder how much of it is fiction. Either way it&#039;s a great read.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently reading the confession by John Grisham and divorce won&#039;t help by Dr. Edmund Bergler. I like to read a non-fiction and fiction at the same time and keep switching. Divorce won&#039;t help is an excellent book and doesn&#039;t have much to do about divorce. My shrink recommended it to me and it gives very deep insight to the human psyche. I&#039;ve been to a lot of shrinks and read a lot of books over the years but this is first shrink and first book which are actually pretty good.

				Man when I get the need to be creeped out or scared a bit, I always hit the H.P. Lovecraft. Clive barker and King owe their asses to him. ( but I&#039;m a big fan of those guys too) For fantasy RA Salvatore, and Michael Moorcock.

				I enjoyed Invisible Monsters.&nbsp; Choke had its moments.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ll put Survivor on the list for later this week, I should be able to pick it up (I am a weirdo, apparently, I like paper books) according to the &quot;available&quot; list I can check online (I like paper books, also like being able to check availability!)<br /><br />Late last night: Alexei Panshin, Rite of Passage. Oldie but very-goodie.<br /><br />Today: Klosterman - Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs (finishing) and will start, er, The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice (Christopher Hitchens.) It&#039;s a re-read, it&#039;s been since it came out. Haven&#039;t been able to find it and just came into a used copy.<br /><br />I tend to have two-three books going at once.<br /><br />Writing down recommendations on the list... (and I could use some fucking funny shit. So Retromancer&#039;s on there.)
