				in certain degree very much true, you can last longer with certain degree of isolation and maintaining external contacts, but as time goes by retardness will progress.

				I&#039;ve always loved the relative isolation of living in a small town, but there are definitely plenty of stupid things like that which sorta make it a zero-sum type deal...

				I gotta say. There&#039;s a lot of stupid mother fuckers. I think in small towns it&#039;s harder to dodge them--my experience in small zones. Moving to larger areas--I think the stupid fuckers get shafted to someme pit so you can at least see a few quasi-functionals vs the stupids that swarm around the small towns.

				I live in a small town, along the bible belt.&nbsp; Ignorance reigns supreme here.&nbsp; Everyone looks down on everyone else.&nbsp; They have nothing better to do with their meager existence than meddle in yours.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad really.&nbsp; But, soon enough i&#039;ll have what i need to leave.&nbsp; So i try to bite my tongue, and avoid any more attention from the police than working at the only head shop already draws.

				The grass is always greener.<br /><br />Move to a city and you will find that there is simply a larger number of retards.<br /><br />The fact is that people are retarded and do not use logic.<br /><br />I plan on getting the fuck out of my city asap.<br /><br />Id rather be in the hills dealing with a couple of retards a lot less often then dealing with retards constantly in a city.

				It&#039;s true there are more retards in the city. But you know how in a small town you&#039;re the only smart person in a group of 2000-5000?<br /><br />Well in a city with 5,000x people, there&#039;s going to be x number of smart people...<br /><br />So that still increases one&#039;s chance of finding their niche.
