				OK, so I&#039;m wondering what you all consider &quot;hard&quot; drugs? Please vote for every drug you think is &quot;hard&quot;.<br /><br />Here are mine and my rationals:<br /><br />HARD:<br /><br />Heroin: Physically addictive. Ruin lives. Many have died.<br />Meth: Physically addictive. Ruins lives.<br />Crack: Physically addictive. Ruins lives.<br /><br />SOFT:<br /><br />Coke: Mildly addictive. Pretty hard to OD.<br />LSD: Not physically addictive. Some have died but it&#039;s rare.<br />Shrooms: Not physically addictive.<br />RCs: Not physically addictive except for maybe a few RCs. Kind of a broad category but in general I would say soft.<br />Prescription Opioids: OK in moderation but can be addictive. This one is tricky.<br />Opium: OK in moderation but can be addictive. Another tricky one.<br />MDMA: Not physically addictive.

				out of the thing&#039;s i&#039;ve tried i would say heroin and washed cocaine are hard drugs - very easy to OD on washed cocaine, i took a little bit too much once and it felt like my heart was going to fail.<br /><br />heroin - if a matchhead size bump can pull my pants down and finger rape my bum, then this is also very easy to OD on<br /><br />not tried crack or meth so i can&#039;t say whether i believe they&#039;re &#039;hard drugs&#039; or not. <br /><br />E, MDMA, LSD, 2C-B, shrooms - while all these fuck me up i don&#039;t think they should be considered hard as i have taken copious amounts of all of them and never once thought i was going to die.<br /><br />just my opinions...

If someone gave them the washed stuff they&#039;d probably die. I think that happens with heroin a lot.<br /><br />That brings up another point. Some RCs are extremely potent and can kill you from taking just a few MGs too much. With that being said, I think in general the people buying them are more likely to know what they&#039;re doing so they&#039;re more likely to exercise caution.

				Hard drugs in my eyes are crack, brown, benzos (when not prescribed) and alcohol.<br />Crack being the worst then benzos, brown and alcohol. This is mainly in terms of addiction potential and withdrawals. We don&#039;t really get meth in England so I duno how bad that is.

				I always figured the distinction between hard and soft drugs was whether or not they were physically addicting. Of course nearly all drugs are safe with the appropriate moderation, but a regular opiate user (whether it&#039;s heroin, fentanyl, morphine, oxycontin, opium, etc.), coke/crack user (BTW it&#039;s absurd to consider the same chemical hard when it&#039;s a solid and soft when it&#039;s a powder), benzo, etc. all experience very real pain and discomfort apart from wanting to do the drug because it&#039;s fun.<br /><br />Marijuana, Mushrooms, Alcohol and Caffeine do have withdrawal to a certain extent, but it&#039;s nothing like opiates or coke.

				Can&#039;t afford to be addicted to coke lol and i find the addiction with coke to be more of a fiending rather than getting ill. More of a mental thing. Never smoked crack so I don&#039;t know If it&#039;s physically addictive.

				yeah i agree with you, except i would add oxy/opana is addictive and ruins life, same as heroin but still in a different category, at least around here its a common addiction and people act a fool just to get some pills. <br /><br />lately black tar heroin has taken over cause its so much cheaper. i dont really think thats a good thing lol <br /><br />nice poll im curious to see what the rest of SR thinks

				So the point of this poll and thread is for education sake? Just for cautionary discussion?

				I definitely place Alcohol and some more obscure and less researched RCs in the &quot;hard drug&quot; category. But for other drugs, I also factor in method of administration. Injecting any sort of drug instantly makes it tiptoe a very fine line over it being a &quot;hard drug&quot; in my book. Injection definitely amplifies many qualities I feel make a drug a &quot;hard drug&quot;. For example, smoking heroin and meth are both activities I&#039;ve, at some point, participated in with virtually no trouble with addiction, overdose potential, or self-harm. However, in my experience most, if not all, users who inject heroin or meth seriously risk both addiction and overdose.<br /><br />Another way to look at it: do you feel yourself wince when you tell other drug users the drugs you do?

Suddenly the world is void, empty, hopeless, depressing and gray beyond words; everyone annoys you, you hate yourself and everything, and after you&#039;ve smoked all your stash, you begin to ghostbust -- see pebbles, pieces of lint, that you think is crack. It never is.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent hours of my life holding crackpipes up to lamps to see if there is any residue left to smoke. I sold most of my movies for crack -- everytime I go to look for a good movie I see they&#039;re all gone, and I say &#039;What the hell!&#039; then I remember I sold them all that month I was into crack . . .<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent evenings alone with my crackpipe in supermarket parking lots; I&#039;ve smoked so much my face and hands and feet have gone numb and my body shaked uncontrollably and my heart was deafening in my ears.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s from erowid and there are plenty more just like it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is a difference in onset, duration, etc. But that&#039;s like saying injected heroin is a hard drug, but smoked heroin is a soft drug. Or pot&#039;s only a soft drug when you put it in brownies.

				I checkmarked heroin and crack. 2 years ago I would have said meth, too, but after using it everyday for as long as I have, it doesn&#039;t scare me anymore. I have a job, I am able to function, I make enough money to support my habit and still live very comfortably. <br /><br />What does &quot;hard&quot; really mean though?

				By that definition, meth isn&#039;t hard at all.. It&#039;s not physically addictive and not everyone that uses it has their life ruined.. Usually it&#039;s the user&#039;s stupidity that ruins their life, if anything..

				Just out of curiosity have you guys hear of the study funded by Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (UK) written Prof David J Nutt that found out of 20 drugs chosen that Alcohol is the most the most harmful.<br /><br />http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2961462-6/fulltext#article_upsell<br /><br />https://profdavidnutt.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/drug-harms-paper-a-summary/<br /><br />I do drink every so often, but I do consider it a hard drug. As far as &quot;hard&quot; drugs go, everything is ok in moderation.&nbsp; <br /><br />nice graph on page below<br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11660210<br />http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/49735000/gif/_49735645_drugs_comparisons_464gr.gif

				Alcohol can be a hard drug, if abused, but I don&#039;t generally tend to see it that way, if say, someone is having a few beers or glasses of wine.&nbsp; I know it can really fuck people up, though.&nbsp; The drugs that mainly concern me, and from which I stray, are meth, heroin, opiates in general, crack, and cocaine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will NEVER do meth, heroin, or opiates.<br />I really want to stay away from coke, but could see myself trying it sometime if it were offered to me.<br /><br />In general, I prefer to stick with cannabis, MXE, K, shrooms, MDMA, and the occasional alcoholic beverage.<br />Still looking into the 2C&#039;s, DMT, and LSD, however.

				The biggest drug dealer in Rocinha (the biggest Favela of Rio de Janeiro, problably biggest in south america) about crack and cocaine:<br /><br />Drogas “Não uso droga, só bebo com os amigos. Acho que em menos de 20 anos a maconha vai ser liberada no Brasil. Nos Estados Unidos, está quase. Já pensou quanto as empresas iam lucrar? Iam engolir o tráfico. Não negocio crack e proíbo trazer crack para a Rocinha. Porque isso destrói as pessoas, as famílias e a comunidade inteira. Conheço gente que usa cocaína há 30 anos e que funciona. Mas com o crack as pessoas assaltam e roubam tudo na frente.”<br /><br />http://revistaepoca.globo.com/tempo/noticia/2011/11/meu-encontro-com-nem.html (Epoca Magazine from Globo)<br /><br />Drugs: &quot;I don&#039;t use drugs, I just drink with friends. I think in less than 20 years, weed will be legalized in Brazil. In USA, it is almost there. Have you ever thought how many companies will get profits? They would beat the traffic.<br /><br />Now, the important part:<br /><br />I do not deal with crack and I forbidden to bring crack to Rocinha. Because this tears the people, the families all the community. I know people who used cocaine for 30 years and they work. But with crack, people stole and assault everything in sight.<br /><br />You can use google translator.<br /><br />I never used cocaine or crack, and I&#039;m not saying cocaine is a soft drug. Maybe in Europe you have less social problems as consequence of cocaine because just rich people can buy it. Besides that, crack is only a residue of cocaine traffic, and a lot of cocaine you see is just crackaine.
