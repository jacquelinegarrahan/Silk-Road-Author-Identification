				Hello Silkroad! I am TorUser1549 and I am looking for some advice for my trip. First of all I will tell you about my trip: I wont go on the details as it will be a really long post and I don&#039;t want anyone to be bored. Summing it up I will be two months going through Europe to two festivals one is the Sziget in Budapest and the other one is called Farr festival in some place of england. <br /><br />I will travelling mostly by train yet I will have to take at least 3 planes during the tirp. If I am here asking for advice it is pretty obvious I want to take drugs during my trip, so here is where you come in :)<br /><br />This is the list of the drugs I will surely want during this trip:<br /><br />MDMA<br />LSD<br />2C-B<br />25I (I have loads of this so I am taking it with me as passing it through customs is a piece of cake)<br />WEED (this is the though one)<br /><br />I am not sure how to get or handle the drugs during my trip. I don&#039;t want to deal with new dealers in each city I go, I would like to have everything organized through the road on some way. Do you think that is possible? <br /><br />I believe that by train I will surely be able to sniff some drugs with no problem yet the plane seems a though one to me. Any advice regarding this?<br /><br />I planned ordering all the drugs to my first stop and then take them always with me as delivery times are not exact on the road. What do you guys think? Would it be risky to order them to a hotel or something like that?<br /><br />Any kind of advice is good including some extra drugs to take! <br /><br />I hope you can help me out. Cheers and thanks to everyone who tries to help me :)<br />

				Hey I&#039;m having more or less the same situation/questions. <br /><br />I have made a thread earlier this week you should check out there are a couple of interesting answers. I&#039;m going to Amsterdam at the Awakenings techno festival myself and have then located a SR vendor from there, he will ship my stuff in a hotel and I will rent a room just to get my drop! <br /><br />I will be checking out this thread in case there are other techniques people would come out with...<br /><br />Happy Eurotrip mate :D<br /><br />Thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157285.msg1111222#msg1111222
