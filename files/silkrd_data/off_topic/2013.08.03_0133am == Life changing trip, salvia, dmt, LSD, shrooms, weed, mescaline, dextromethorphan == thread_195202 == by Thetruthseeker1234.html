				Can I get everyone&#039;s opinion on what I am about to do.<br />I want to go into the deepest places in my mind and experience the most extreme.<br /><br />The plan is like this:<br />3PM take 700mg mescaline and 750mg dextromethorphan hBr<br />4PM take 200ug of LSD and 5grams shrooms<br />5PM smoke a good amount of some 60x salvia extract<br />5:30PM I should be peaking on all drugs about now<br />5:30PM Smoke 150mg pure DMT sandwiched on some A++ weed<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be alone throughout this adventure, but as I am very experienced with these substances I don&#039;t see that as a problem. <br />If anyone can shed light on the drugs crossing and intensifying each other, that would be great. For example is the trip going to last until the early AM or even later. <br /><br />What do you think?<br />

				sounds bananas<br /><br />I would minus the dxm though. it could cause a reaction mixing it with psychedelics, not 100% sure though. just saying<br /><br />maybe the dmt will cancel everything out, you&#039;re going to space!

				Though it sounds amazing, definitely a waste of highs. That&#039;s enough drugs for getting high every day off of something different for a week, and it&#039;s all in one day.<br /><br />Definitely log a trip report, would love to hear how it goes.

Tolerance builds on each one, so by day 3 I would need to megadose. <br /><br />Iv done all of these separately and don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s wonderful, but not the life changing experience I need. If I just wanted to get fucked up I&#039;d do a few lines of blow.

				The thing is with the dxm hbr it&#039;s hard to find a legitimate sorce for the powder. There used to be some good dex vendors on here, but now they all disappeared. The vendor poppermachine offers hbr at 10 a gram, but I have heard some really bad reports about him so he doesn&#039;t seem trustworthy and could give me the wrong version of the dxm chemical.<br /><br />I need the dextromethorphan in this trip because it intensifies psychedelics. By numbing the whole body you feel less of a connection with it, allowing you to give into the power of the psychedelic drugs better.
