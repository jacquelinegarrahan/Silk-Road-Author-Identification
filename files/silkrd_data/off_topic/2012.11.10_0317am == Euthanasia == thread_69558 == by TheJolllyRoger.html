				First of all not that i plan on listing anything like this or am looking to take my own life but i am very much pro Euthanasia, from seeing an elder unnecessary suffering for years it made me think that Euthanasia really should be legal and regulated everywhere, its the bravest most compassionate thing you could do for a loved one whos suffering without any chance.<br /><br />Since its not legal most places is there a &quot;place&quot; for a Euthanasia pill made by some proper chemist vendor on the road? A place of freedom? or is it allowed to be spoken of on here at all?<br /><br />Obviously it could be used to murder people then too but dying with dignity is something people who want to &quot;go&quot; deserve.<br /><br />Opions?

				Jack Kevorkian comes to mind on this specific topic -- he built a thanatron (death machine) where people could administer a lethal injection to themselves.&nbsp; He was a suicide pioneer and I support the right to die.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fucking shame that people have to overdose on pills, jump off tall buildings, and shoot themselves just to end their lives.

				There was a BBC documentary called &quot;How to kill a human being&quot;. Go watch that. The basic conclusion is that hypoxia is probably the most humane way to die. You need a cylinder of Nitrious Oxide and a mask. And basically you&#039;ll die in absolute bliss with zero distress. And it&#039;ll be over in a minute or so.

				Humane, assisted suicide is a very, very controversial issue.<br /><br />It&#039;s not going to be legalized for a very long time, if ever.<br /><br />Humans have a right to life, but nowhere is it written they have a right to take it.<br /><br />While there are companies to sap cash from dying elders, there will be no such service as regulated humane suicide.<br /><br />Some would say that is a good thing, others would say it is a bad thing. Your opinion is, of course, your own.<br /><br />Personally, I haven&#039;t formulated one on this particular issue. I think that the only thing worse than loss of life however, is suffering and pain.<br /><br />- The Consultant

				Yeah there are many cons to it also i agree there, although having seen it first hand my opinion might be a bit emotive.<br /><br />But Euthanasia isnt &quot;taking someones life&quot; its being a brave human being and assisting them in doing so becaue tey cannot themselves othrwise they would, once their of sound mind etc.<br /><br />Euthanasia isnt something to rushed into or taken lightly, its not like some poor manic depressed guy committing suicide in a fit of darknesss, its a totally compassionate honorable last resort thing to do for people suffering i think, <br /><br />like Aqualung said below&quot; It&#039;s a fucking shame that people have to overdose on pills, jump off tall buildings, and shoot themselves just to end their lives.&quot; <br /><br />It really is.<br />

Wiki is your friend. :)<br /><br />&quot;Ballot Measure 16 in 1994 established the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which legalizes physician-assisted dying with certain restrictions, making Oregon the first U.S. state and one of the first jurisdictions in the world to officially do so.&quot;<br /><br />This law was actually upheld by the Supreme court in 2005. And,<br /><br />&quot;Initiative 1000 (I-1000) of 2008 established the U.S. state of Washington&#039;s Death with Dignity Act (RCW 70.245[1]), which legalizes physician-assisted dying with certain restrictions. Passage of this initiative made Washington the second U.S. state to permit some terminally ill patients to determine the time of their own death.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I believe this will snowball just like marijuana legalization (though probably not as quickly). While physician assisted suicide is certainly more controversial than legal weed, the same reason and experience that would lead you to support (I assume!) the later will do the same for the former. I think as people become less thestically driven (an observable process, 3 in ten 18-24 self-identify as Atheists, the O&#039;reilly&#039;s of the world call it the &quot;loss of traditional America&quot; after Romney&#039;s defeat), our policies start reflecting our use of reason and experience when reaching our conclusions. You see it first in the liberal states, but even Texas at least has a &quot;passive euthanasia&quot; law (though it&#039;s kind of a joke, not the same thing). You just can&#039;t experience a terminally ill person&#039;s choice, and follow though, to perform a physician assisted suicide first hand (which I&#039;ve been fortunate to never have in my family or friends) or via one of the many excellent documentaries on the subject and not come to the conclusion that making this service available under the proper conditions is the only humane, just, and ultimately sane thing to do. So as theism drifts out of our collective/political consciousness, we&#039;ll be left with only reason and experience to determine what is the proper stance to take on euthanasia.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend watching &quot;How to Die in Oregon,&quot; a great HBO documentary which covers the grass roots effort behind the Oregon law. Spoiler: it&#039;s totally made up of people who have had to help a terminally ill person die with dignity, and their friends and loved ones. It&#039;s intensely emotional, but we should all be as well informed about important issues like this as possible, so it&#039;s definitely worth a watch.

				I&#039;ve seen people slowly dying and it&#039;s terrible. Nobody should be forced to suffer. <br /><br />I don&#039;t care what the law says. If I ever get in that situation, I have some plans to prevent that from happening to me. You could call it an exit strategy.
