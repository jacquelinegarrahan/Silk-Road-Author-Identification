				I wanted to get their perspectives of life and using drugs after serving. I have a friend in this situation (PTSD) and wondering if I could find some others in that boat. I told him he should try smoking some herb, or something to pry open that third eye. Sometimes I think it would do me a bit of good to enlist, but I may be past the point of being able to take orders from someone though,&nbsp; I dunno, any thoughts on any of this?

				MDMA is great for veterans. I have hooked up more than one vet and it seems like everytime they had a good experience.

MDMA probably does wonders for them, but It seems like LSD wouldn&#039;t be a good idea for most of them though. The beginning of that movie Jacobs Ladder makes me think of how they might react.<br />

You`ll have to tread carefully, you can easily be in trouble for just being exposed using this site or stating your view on it. I`m sure you`ll get a lot of experience from going to camp, then forward. I have no idea about Veterans using drugs to be honest, I know some become bums/suffer and die from PTSD or lose their will to live. You`ll also have to give up any drug use if you`re ever gonna get in.<br />

				In my opinion, fuck enlisting. I&#039;d rather think for myself and live my own life, thank you. Unless I was able to trip balls on acid while serving like in Apocalypse Now, then I&#039;d never join them. &gt;:(

I like the idea of certain things they instill in people, Etc., but I could probably get alot of that with just joining a good karate class. I&#039;m just to independent mentally to take orders at this age. I do like the idea of the bond you would develop between your fellow men &amp; women.<br />

				Sure...<br />Weed makes the symptoms worse, MDMA + 2C-B are the best, especially by the PTSD (PTBS in Germany) Syndrom.<br /><br />

				LSD is actually thought to help with PTSD. I wouldn&#039;t recommend your friend trying alot of LSD at first but start small and build on that. He should definitely try some MDMA if he&#039;s up for it though.
