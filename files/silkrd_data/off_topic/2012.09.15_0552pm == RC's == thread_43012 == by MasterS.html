				Is there anyone familiar with RC&#039;s can give me recommendations? All I&#039;ve tried is Methylone and 25C-NBOME and I loved them both. Anyone with experience have a few that everyone should try? There are so many out there it&#039;s hard to decide which to try next. I understand drug safety so I&#039;m only looking for what you want the spread the love for and why.

				Have you tried any of Tyl3r Durden&#039;s NBOMe capsules or nasal spray? Since trying NBOMes by nasal route, along with the speed you come up on them (15-30mins) I prefer them to tabs. So far I&#039;ve tried 25i, 25c and some combo caps which are the fucking business. Check his listings and feedback thread, but as a repeat customer I guarantee you won&#039;t be disappointed. You can pick up 10 of the caps for less than 3btc including postage and 1 will have you tripping balls for a good 4hrs minimum

				Generally speaking, I try to avoid RCs as much as possible. It simply isn&#039;t worth the risk. I never try a RC that doesnt have any reviews etc. As far as RCs go, I have tried Butylone, Mephedrone, MXE, 25i-NBOMe and some synthetic cannabinoids. <br /><br />Butylone had me feeling great for a few hours, but the comedown was horrible and I didn&#039;t have any benzos avaliable so I had a terrible, sleepless night, followed by a day of pure depression. <br />Mephedrone was fine, but the urge to use more more more more is something to be aware of.<br />MXE is by far the one I enjoyed the most. It was quite different from ketamine, yet the base feeling was obviously very similar. A lot more fun though.<br />25i-NBOMe-I experienced a very anxious comeup and the effects were mild, but that is because a low dose was administered (300-600mcg)<br />Synthetic cannabinoids-Not much to say. Like cannabis with bad side effects and a dirty feeling. Not recommended.<br />I don&#039;t want to try any other phenetylamine-based RCs, but I am interested in trying some tryptamines, so maybe give them a go :) Stay safe.

				Personally I&#039;d advise you try Mephedrone. It&#039;s my favourite drug... Wonderful Euphoria, music appreciation, rush, talkativeness and HUGE self confidence boost.<br /><br />It was originally an MDMA replacement... IMO it feels a lot different to MDMA, but with some similarities. <br /><br />The similarities are:<br />Music Appreciation<br />Euphoria<br />Empathy - Now with Mephedrone the &#039;empathy&#039; aspect is slightly different to MDMA&#039;s... MDMA is a feeling of love and compassion or others, you love everyone, you feel peace with the world bla bla. But with Drone its more a feeling that everyone is fucking AMAZING. <br /><br />Mephedrone has similarities to Coke and Amphetamine as well, these being:<br />Feeling like SUPERMAN<br />Being very talkative (Personally it makes me more talkative than Amphetamine does)<br />Stimulation.<br />Improved self confidence.<br /><br />MDMA in its pure form isn&#039;t very stimulating... In fact, it makes me feel quite relaxed... which is why it is known as the &#039;relaxing Amphetamine&#039;. But Mephedrone is VERY stimulating... The rush is quite intense too, almost overwhelming euphoria. <br /><br />Now for the dose...<br /><br />The two ROA&#039;s I&#039;ve used are oral and nasal. <br /><br />Snorting 100-150mgs of Drone (As a first time user) should put you in a good place. It hurts a bit, but to be honest, you soon get used to it. I&#039;d then do 50mg top ups every 20-30 mins to keep the buzz going.<br /><br />Parachuting it works well too (I find that this ROA is much more MDMA like). I&#039;d do 250-300mgs... This should give quite an intense but not too intense an experience. <br /><br />What I like to do is parachute 200mgs wait 15 mins then do a 100mg line. This gives the extended duration of taking it orally, and the more intense experience of taking it nasally. <br /><br />Unlike MDMA, re-dosing brings back the peak effects! Though if you want to play it safe, don&#039;t go over a gram :). <br /><br />Oh and this stuff is even more amazing when combined with M1. <br /><br /><br />

				ty zapa, I did 25c-nbome nasally much better than sublinqually<br /><br />alanko I love the Aphex avatar. People said that urge to redose with Methylone but I didn&#039;t get that at all. Never tried Ketamine so would probably go that route before MXE ^_^<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m an MDMA person so euphoria is more by bag. My favorite Psychedelic is MDA. The 25C-NBOMe was fun but not something to do regularly. <br /><br />Oh I forgot I had Pentedrone, felt like a caffeine but instead of jitters the energy felt controllable. Slight headache though but caffeine does the same for me.<br /><br />tl;dr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Euphoria and/or Stimulants with fun functional visuals make me happy.

				sollemnis That sounds great! Since I have done Methylone is there a way to compare it with Mephedrone for me? People compared Methylone to MDMA for me but to me apples and oranges which is kinda like what you were saying with the Mephedrone, how about the comparison of those two? They sound similar to me.

Mephedrone is a lot more Euphoric than M1. Makes you talk more... Gives you more Stimulation, makes you feel more like superman. I loved M1, I even wrote a trip report for it. But it still has nothing on Mephedrone. <br /><br />They both give you music appreciation, but that&#039;s the only similarity IMO. And IMO music sounds better on Drone than it does on M1.<br /><br />M1 for me feels like a weaker version of MDMA, with slightly more stimulation, with its own little unique magic too. M1 combined with Mephedrone shits on ANYTHING I&#039;ve ever taken :)<br />

I hope I am making myself clear :D

				If you like ketamine at all, MXE is a fun one. Although not quite like K it is similar in effect. It&#039;s a little more hallucinogenic I&#039;d say in my own experience and a little &quot;dirtier&quot; feeling but still a good time.

				I&#039;ve tried:<br />Methylone<br />MXE<br />5-MeO-MiPT<br />And some sketchy ass pill I got from someone who told me it was methylone<br /><br />Methylone is b FAR my favorite drug. I tend to IV about 100mg at a time, and that fucking knocks me into another, ultra erotic world. I&#039;ll do two IV doses about about three hours, and take 250mg rectally because it lasts longer and the come down is a lot better. Once I feel my rectal peak is about over, I&#039;ll take about 2mg of phenazepam, and have a wonderful, restful night sleep.<br /><br />With the IV methylone, I&#039;ve found finishing with a rectal dose and benzos is very important, otherwise I&#039;ll have no self control. Last week I was in a pretty bad place mentally, and I IVd 3.5 grams of methylone in less than 24 hours, and it really fucked me up. I&#039;ve also found that if I take 100mg of viagra 30 minutes prior to methylone dosing, it really reduces a lot of the negative health effects I get from IVing methylone. Methylone is a pretty strong vasoconstrictor, so the viagra counteracts that, and prevents weird heart rates and rashes.<br /><br />I hated MXE, and 5-meo-mipt was cool, but not something I&#039;d want to take often. Little or no visuals, but everything feels amaaazing (sex, eating, taking a shower, etc...) it also gives you this sort of vague, hard to describe &quot;stoned&quot; feeling that&#039;s kind of like weed, but not at all at the same time.
