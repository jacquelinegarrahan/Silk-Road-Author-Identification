				Hello family,<br /><br />I had my baby pass away two days ago and want to get out the game!&nbsp; It&#039;s my life though and I want to be here.&nbsp; If anyone can help out with any costs of anything I will be going thru it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I am at a loss of words, I took all of my listings down because this is the hardest thing in my whole life that I have ever went through!&nbsp; Even prison for 3 years was easier than this!<br /><br />Im not begging, but with the sudden decline in BTC I&#039;ve lost a substantial amount of money on top of costs (I know you have too!!)&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen these before where people leave nasty responses about this being fraud, if for any reason these are your thoughts then first, if you were thinking of helping out and would like some sort of proof PM me.&nbsp; If you just want to talk shit cuz I can&#039;t reach out and touch you from here then you are a coward and don&#039;t even waste your time posting, go F with someone else.<br /><br />1AeR55wvRVtQ3mwGLrsd7zRpT3roaGY6W6 is where to send anything that can count.&nbsp; even a penny if that&#039;s what you can afford.&nbsp; I look at this place as my second family, If you don&#039;t know me or never dealt with me, I try to treat everyone that I do business with better treatment that they have ever received on the road! I&#039;m a strait shooter, I&#039;m not here to rip you off, and I would&nbsp; ever do this for personal gain.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even want to do it in the first place.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen others so I thought I would give it a try since I just found out the jewelry peices for the ashes were not 275 apiece they&#039;re 800 apiece for me and my wife.&nbsp; I just spent that much on the urn!!&nbsp; I just want to be able to get this for my wife, she broke down when I told her they gave us the wrong price and they were almost triple apiece!~<br /><br />please don&#039;t leave any disrespectful responses this is hard enough for me~~~~~I&#039;m burying my baby!

				I&#039;m really sorry for your loss. I know personally how hard it is. I can&#039;t even imagine what you are going through.<br /><br />While I cannot offer any btc-nothing in my account-I can lend an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on if you need it. Feel free to PM me.<br /><br />**hugs**
