				Its a brown goop now? I kept it in a dark cabinet in a vacuum sealed jar. Its been a little hot here but I always keep the AC on, it isn&#039;t THAT bad.<br /><br />I&#039;m worried about all my other drugs I keep them all in there as well, LSD too!!!<br /><br />Any experts know about the shelf life of this drug.

				Yea I did, its really strange. I&#039;m getting reports online that it just gets converted to psilocin and its still good to eat. This actually is not super rare?<br /><br />I pmed the vender and he said this &quot;the brown smudge is still good. it is not ruined. just looks crazy weird.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m very skeptical about all this, I&#039;m probably gonna reagent test it now or eat it this weekend. I&#039;ll report back.

				Cool, I&#039;m happy it worked for you.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested to hear if the nature of it&#039;s effects differ much after coverting to goo (psilocyn).<br />I tried 4-aco-dmt once and have no desire to do it again (bad trip, no resemblance to shrooms at all imo).&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve done the brown goop, and it gets you fucked up, but different from 4-ACO-DMT.<br /><br />Copied this from some board. Makes sense to me:<br /><br />Just a quick heads up, please make sure that it is a crystalline white powder if you do continue through with this. If the product you receive is of a brown, gooey consistency, this is 4-AcO-DMT that has been degraded into 4-HO-DMT which is a markedly different trip. Unfortunately this degradation from 4-AcO-DMT to 4-HO-DMT happens extremely quickly if not properly vacuum sealed, and because people buy bulk but can&#039;t sell it quickly, there are a lot of vendors peddling degraded 4-AcO-DMT in the brown, goeey form and stating there is no difference. This is entirely false.<br /><br />

				i was told by the seller to keep my 4-aco-dmt somewhere dry and cool/cold to keep it from degrading. i&#039;ve had it stored for maybe 3 years now, and it&#039;s still white powder. i hadn&#039;t heard of the brown goo phenomenon, that&#039;s pretty bizarre. let us know if you take it, how it goes, eh?
