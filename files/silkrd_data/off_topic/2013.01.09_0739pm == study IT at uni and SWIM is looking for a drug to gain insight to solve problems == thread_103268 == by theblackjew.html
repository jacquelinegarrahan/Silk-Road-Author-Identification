				SWIM had some mephedrone and claims he can solve any problem on it, he can think outside the box and logically at the same time and come up with things swim wouldnt think of sobre, just wondering what would be the best thing to have to think outside the box? so maybe i can think of a awesome program to design or something? thank yee ps. i may possibly be swim and my brother from another mother goes to uni :)<br /><br />ps. please dont be concerned about swim using it irresponsibility to solve all my uni problems or to study and becomming dependent on it or whatever :) cheers peoples

				No drug can guarantee you anything but I would go for LSD :). Even Steve Jobs said that LSD was one of the most important experiences in his life. It&#039;s magical.

				I can&#039;t say that it would qualify as the &quot;drugs&quot; OP probably has in mind, but I&#039;ve had remarkably positive experience with daily piracetam supplementation. If you don&#039;t already know what piracetam is, a quick search on google will enlighten you. As for dosage, though it&#039;s usually taken around 3.5 g mark, I normally intake around 7-8 g dissolved in cherry soda in the morning. The dosage I use has been reported to be beneficial for the elderly suffering from dementia. The cognitive enhancement it provides is rather subtle, but definitely noticeable and it has a wonderful synchronicity with most other drugs, particularly phenethylamines. <br /><br />For $90, you can order a whole kilo:<br />http://www.cerebralhealth.com/brainhealthsupplements.php (Ctrl + F &quot;bulk piracetam&quot;)<br /><br />

				Maybe experiment with microdosing with LSD. At small doses, like 10-20ug, you&#039;d have more of your &#039;normal&#039; state of mind available to problem solve, whereas at higher doses it&#039;s pretty easy to get distracted by the drug experience.

But only at first, once you get used to them they don&#039;t expand shit anymore. <br /><br />Overly euphoric drugs (like I believe meph is, not sure) only distract imho, you think you found the holy grail, but once sober it looks a bit different. <br /><br />LSD - I need to try that, but I believe it&#039;s the most promising regarding problem solving. There is a trip report from a programmer on here somewhere...
