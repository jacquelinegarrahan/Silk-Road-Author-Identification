				Hi,<br /><br />i was just wondering if anybody would be willing to verify or has had any particular experience of this site on tor &quot;whmx counterfeit&quot; who specialize in selling counterfeit currency both euro and dollar.<br /><br />has anybody heard if they are legit or would be willing to see if they are a verified genuine seller?, the price there products are listed as does seem that it might not hurt to take a risk anyway but i thought i would just ask on here just incase someone else with more experience has heard anything on here?.<br /><br />Regards...

				Okay their site is back online and it look really nice. They say they accept escrow (&quot;Acrimonious&quot;; wwth5ym23tqpyu7i.onion).<br />Only problem is that their MOQ is 25 bills. I&#039;m thinking about placing an order and reselling some of the bills at BMR :D

				hmmm I&#039;d try them out if the minimum order was lower.... it says minimum order of 25 bills, @ half a coin a pop that&#039;s roughly 150$ for the first order.... Anyone willing to take the leap of faith and test order?&nbsp; :)

				I tested WHMX.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was scammed. <br /><br />I paid to Acrimonious2 escrow. <br /><br />WHMX said that he used UPS, through Mail Box Etc., to ship.<br /><br />WHMX said that the package was seized by customs, and that I would be receiving a letter (at my shipping address) from customs informing me of the seizure.&nbsp; I never received any letter from customs or anyone else.<br /><br />WHMX sent me an invoice with MailBoxEtc., that allegedly showed the date of shipping and the date that customs seized it.&nbsp; The invoice was phony.<br /><br />I asked WHMX to provide me with the UPS tracking number.<br /><br />WHMX said that he did not have a tracking number.<br /><br />I told him that all UPS packages have tracking numbers. <br /><br />He ignored. <br /><br />I have requested a return of my money from Acrimoneous2.&nbsp; They have not yet responded. <br /><br />Bottom line:&nbsp; scam.<br /><br />Advice:&nbsp; There are many excellent vendors of drugs on Silk Road.&nbsp; They best ones have a long track record with hundreds of purchases.&nbsp; I have never had a problem with any of them, although I am usually careful about reading up on them before I buy.&nbsp; If someone was really selling&nbsp; Counterfeit Money, they would have an enormous positive following.&nbsp; That fact is that there is no Counterfeit Money available anywhere on Silk Road or Tor.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have not ignored and the tracking was not false. I&#039;ve always answered the same day.<br />I did not say that had no tracking,I said I did not have it at that time.. Now I have it, anyway I offered a partial refund.<br />And you&#039;ve ignored me.<br />We have good reviews on other forums, and I&#039;m not a scam but I can not do more.<br /><br />A Screenshot:&nbsp; http://i46.tinypic.com/2vmx7jp.jpg

				I have placed an order over a month ago, this time he used Acrimonous2. It seems he changes websites and escrow sites frequently. Needless to say I still didn&#039;t get any product.. He told me he had to cancel the transaction and &#039;hopes I get the refund&quot; I have still not received my refund, my transaction in escrow service was cancelled and Acrimonous2 is not responding to any of my messages. Definitely smells like a scam. I am trying to work with WHMX but if I don&#039;t get my money back soon I will be sure to make sure to get the word out.
