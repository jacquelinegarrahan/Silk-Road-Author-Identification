				(This is a repost/summary of http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126732 )<br /><br />Dr. Alexander &quot;Sasha&quot; Shulgin discovered countless psychedelic drugs and authored several books on the subject (the best-known being PiHKAL and TiHKAL). However, he has undergone a stroke and several operations, and requires constant medical care, even at home. He and his wife are swamped with medical bills and barely make ends meet, and have been forced to request donations.<br /><br />Dr. Shulgin&#039;s donation site (in clearnet, of course) is at http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/donate/ (clearnet!). The site currently accepts donations in PayPal and they list his address for sending cash. I&#039;m currently trying to contact the Shulgin&#039;s about accepting bitcoin donations; I&#039;ll update this thread when there&#039;s news in that field.<br /><br />&nbsp;It is the least that we, as a community, can do, to help the man who helped us discover ourselves. Please consider doing so.<br />

				Of course, as someone who spends no small amount of his time as a complete paranoid wreck, it occurred to me that there&#039;s something a bit paranoia-inducing about a call for SR members to all suddenly donate to a single cause...<br /><br />The donation letter (see original post) was published in clearnet, so there&#039;s no singling out of SR, plenty of people should be donating once the letter has circulated. Here&#039;s the (clearnet!) link to the open letter: http://teafaerie.org/2013/02/456/ (clearnet!)

				I just read this blog post you are referring to, and it was very moving. It is almost shameful how little thought is given to this great man in his time of need. I encourage everyone to watch the movie Dirty Pictures, and to donate what you can to this revolutionary scientist.

				I got a reply from the folks at Erowid.<br /><br />To donate amounts greater than $100 (That&#039;s about 2.7BTC in current rates), you can send the donation to Erowid, along with a message saying that you wish to have the money sent to the Shulgin family:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />You can contact them directly through shulginresearch.org or you can <br />coordinate BTC donations larger than $100 through erowid. Because of the <br />annoyance of managing small donations (many BTC donations we get are <br />less than one US dollar), I&#039;m not really willing to deal with tiny <br />amounts that have to be accounted for and then transferred.<br /><br />But, if it&#039;s $100 or more, we can take the donation and pass 100% of it <br />on to them.&nbsp; If it&#039;s more than a few thousand USD, then we would need to <br />account for it slightly differently, but we&#039;re still happy to work with <br />you and them to make it as easy as possible.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
