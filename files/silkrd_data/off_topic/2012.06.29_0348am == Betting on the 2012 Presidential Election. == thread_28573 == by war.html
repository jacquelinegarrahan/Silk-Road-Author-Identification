				I don&#039;t follow politics at all, I am actually scared to watch any mainstream news source as I feel so brainwashed... seriously after you hear an infomercial for one of the candidates think about how swayed you feel... its awful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, on Bodog and other major sports betting sites you can bet on who will become president... anyone think this would be a really profitable investment?&nbsp; <br /><br />Look forward to hearing all your opinions...<br /><br />Much Love &lt;3<br /><br />-War

Maybe if the entire financial system collapsed, and society descended into chaos, there&#039;d be a chance to change things.

				Until the voice of the actual citizens are herd, and I&#039;m not talking about state reps as they tend to suck balls, our government will continue to suck. The fact of the matter is to have any say in this nation you NEED to have money and power.<br /><br />ie. You cannot run for election if you cannot afford it (no job, constantly visiting new regions of the USA, food, hotels), its quite expensive so only the wealthy are ever able to run.<br /><br />IMO, were screwed no matter who wins

WALL STREET.<br />He had more money from Wall Street in 2008 than anybody in history.<br />This year is the same shit.<br />He is owned by Goldman &amp; Sachs.<br />He is owned by George Soros.<br />He is owned by Hollywood.<br />He don&#039;t give a fuck about poor people.<br />His wife Michelle is from the poorest neighborhood in Chicago.<br />There are more people being killed in the streets of Chicago over gang violence everyday than there are soldiers getting killed in Afghanistan. <br />I didn&#039;t pull that out of my ass either, that is a motherfucking fact. Look it up.<br />Obama cares about poor people.<br />On top of that, all those kids shooting each other in Michelle&#039;s neighborhood is because of the WAR ON DRUGS so bringing that shit on this forum is ironic at best.<br /><br />He cares about gay people? <br />Its true, he said he is for gay marriage. <br />But that isn&#039;t worth the paper it is written on. <br />He ain&#039;t Congress. He don&#039;t write the laws. He makes sure they are executed.<br />Big fucking difference.<br /><br />You know what he is going to say in October to get you really slobbing on his knob?<br />He is going to say he is for the legalization of Marijuana.<br />You are going to go all Obama Girl and Get your weed leaf shirt with a rainbow flag that says Obama &#039;12.<br />BUT remember, it don&#039;t matter what the fuck Obama says, he ain&#039;t the legislature.<br />Weed is not getting legalized and gays are still not going to be able to get married.<br /><br />As for killing Obama, that is why I am being so harsh.<br />You think he killed Obama?<br />He has been dead since 2002.<br />I hate to shatter your world but 9/11 was Inside Job and the War on Terror is as real as the Easter Bunny.<br />You think they are going to corner the alleged mastermind of the most horrific attack on U.S. soil and just shoot him?<br />The most elite Special Ops Recon Team in the world has OBL cornered in his bedroom while he is in his pajamas watching TV and they shoot him?<br />HAHAHAHA <br />Don&#039;t you want to extract intelligence from the leader of the most dangerous terrorist organization on the planet?<br />Especially with your exceptionally effective enhance interrogation skills?<br />Those same ones that were so horrific under Bush but now you bust a nut over it when Obama is the one water boarding.<br />Guantanamo is still open, the Patriot Act got renewed, Obama is ordering drones to assassinate leaders of foreign countries (Ghaddafi) and United State Citizens without even a trial.<br />Do you see the precedent this man is setting?<br />And you think he is different from Bush or Romney.<br />Its only getting worse. <br />Obama is Bush but only half white.<br /><br />Now back to Osama Bin Laden. I really want you to rap your head around this because you have been programmed.<br />Why did they not capture OBL?<br />Because he allegedley reached for an AK47? Okay. <br />Why not shoot him in the shoulder, leg, hell even the abdomen? <br />You are the most highly trained Spec Ops Team on the planet.<br />No? You just shoot him in the head right between the eyes?<br />Okay. But then you are going to bring the body back to America for all the victims of 9/11?<br />No? That is barbaric?<br />Okay. Well you are at least going to show us a picture of his dead body?<br />No? Why not? Because you are afraid that will inflame Muslim extremists to commit more terrorists attacks?<br />Okay. Well at least you will show us a picture of his washed body, dressed in traditional Arab garb right before you give him his &quot;Traditional Muslim Burial At Sea&quot;, right?&nbsp; <br />No? We are just going to have to take your word for it that you killed Osama and on the way back just throw his body in the ocean to never be seen again.<br /><br />HAHAHA<br /><br />Okay.

The government is horrible at keeping secrets, so I&#039;m supposed to believe an international conspiracy exists to convince the world Bin Laden was alive for ten years, making asses out of the Alphabet mafia, making American intelligence services look weak and timid? For what purpose exactly? Out of all the personnel involved in that operation and intelligence, you&#039;d think there would be a leak of information, same with the fucking moon landing. Just crazy fucking nonsense.&nbsp; ???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Shit isn&#039;t nearly as deep as some people perceive it to be, but everyone is entitled to think what they would like to :)

				Yes, because Oliver Stone is an expert on political assassination. Just because Kevin Costner is in a movie doesn&#039;t make it a factual event. Waterworld isn&#039;t exactly a true story, and it had a spectacular budget. Here&#039;s a conspiracy theory for you, where the fuck did those guys get all those factory-made cigarettes hundreds of years into the watery future? <br /><br />And the Postman sucked balls. <br /><br />You aren&#039;t even interesting. Rant about actual conspiracy theories like the USS Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, Nixon&#039;s entire presidency and how Ronald Regan caused 9/11 if you want my attention.

				Obama will win the election. It&#039;s quite obvious and there has been a trend in recent years. I don&#039;t want him to win, and he has done a horrible job. I would bet money on it. He has fucked up a lot recently but people are likely to choose something they are most comfortable with.

				@Vinny and Kryptoz,<br /><br />I know you guys are both 20 year old college students who are high on drugs but read the fucking post.<br /><br />It would be hard WHEN only 5% of the population voted.<br />Or maybe I should have said IF only 5% of the population voted.<br />Because then they would not be legitimate.<br />When little fucking kids like you go and vote because he said he doesn&#039;t care about gay marriage you ruin it for the smart people who know this is all a game of charades.<br />DON&#039;T VOTE or if you do get the fuck of this forum and delete your account from Silk Road. This is for anarcho-capitialists, not fucking retards.<br /><br />I am done talking to you little fucking kids who don&#039;t know shit.<br />And Vinny, lay off the speed.

				I&#039;d have to agree.. Not voting is a respectable decision.<br /><br />Won&#039;t change anything until 95% of the people agree though (which won&#039;t happen, because we&#039;re a dumb species)<br /><br />
