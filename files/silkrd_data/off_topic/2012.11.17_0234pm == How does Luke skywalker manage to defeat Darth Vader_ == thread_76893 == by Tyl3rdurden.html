				A major plot hole in my opinion, Darth Vader born of 2 Jedi parents and the highest midichlorian count, has been trained in the Jedi arts since the age of 10 yet Luke skywalker born of only one Jedi parent and only a few years Jedi training at best can defeat him?

				Luke did not kill Vader... Vader was killed by the Emperor. After chopping off Vader&#039;s hand in a lightsaber duel on the new Death Star, Luke realized he was going down the same path as his father. He throws he saber to the side saying that he would never turn to the Dark Side and how he was a Jedi like his father. The Emperor then tries killing Luke with Force Lightning. Seeing his son in pain, Vader hoists the Emperor up, taking the brunt of the Force Lightning, and throwing him into a long reactor shaft. On the verge of Death, Luke tries to save his father, finally getting to see his face behind the mask, before his Father dies in his arms on the Death Star just before it blows up.

				Meh, I&#039;d still say he pretty much defeated him, having your arm chopped off and beat to the ground isn&#039;t exactly a &quot;win&quot;
