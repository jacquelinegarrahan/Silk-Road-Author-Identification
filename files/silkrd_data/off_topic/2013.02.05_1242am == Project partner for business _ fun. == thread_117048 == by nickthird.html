				I have several ideas for sites that mostly stem from that fact that I think the web has a lot of untapped potential as a tool to connect people in meaningful ways.<br /><br />One idea I finished developing the design and algorithm for is basically a large anonymous 1:1 chat room with a filter.<br />The filter mainly enables the user to dissect the other users into foreign groups (you talk with someone from A someone from B would be different).<br /><br />It should also help find specific kinds of people but I don&#039;t know with what accuracy until I run it (then make changes to improve its precision).<br />At the very least it should help in describing partial similarity, but the idea is that users should learn by themselves what kinds of filters work for them.<br /><br />EDIT: to clarify: it doesn&#039;t rely on self assessment / tests / AI / my opinion on how people should be categorized.<br /><br />This can be used for dating, business, normal chat etc. <br /><br />I can program myself but I&#039;m limited to OS apps, no experience in site building/design nor the time for that right now.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for someone who likes the idea mentioned or my approach in general to work with me on a project (whatever you have to offer).<br />I would like to make money out of ads, but if you resent that kind of thing, I&#039;d do it just for fun.
