				I ran out of medication, which is one of the few things that keep me alive.<br /><br />Now the only thing keeping me tied to this world are the very few friends who I have, who have sworn their lives to me.<br /><br />I cannot abandon them, I&#039;m responsible for them, but that doesn&#039;t make it hurt any less.<br /><br />Would you suggest some music, especially happy hardcore, something that can take the edge off?<br /><br />Thank you.

				I don&#039;t know about music but whenever I get depressed I just try to contemplate the nihilistic side of life.<br /><br />When you are ready to die and have nothing to bind you to the mortal realm you are for the first time ever, completely free. Your actions can no longer have meaningful consequences because life has proven itself to have no meaning. I look at soul crushing depression as an opportunity. I can walk up to that hot chick and tell her I would love to be inside her. I can see what taking 20 hits of acid really feels like. I can run up the credit card by booking a trip to Rome. Nothing matters because I simply don&#039;t care. Normally during these reckless exploits I experience a shift in perspective that allows me to appreciate that by not caring about anything at all I am truly able to fall in love with life again by exploring sides of it that were always lost to me through reason and fear.<br /><br />Oh, and listening to Jewel when I&#039;m down never hurts either... love that chick for some reason.

				&#039;Learning to Fly&quot; works for me, but I like to find something that seems in a much worse state than me. Another, and I don&#039;t remember the name or artist, is the song on GTA4 about the &quot;Junkie walking through the twilight - Tryin&#039; to find my way home...&quot;. I don&#039;t think that qualifies as Happycore, but cold rainy days cheer me up. I should have been born a Brit...<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Happy hardcore is exactly the kind of music that would get me severely depressed and despaired about life&nbsp; :)<br /><br />That being said, I only listen to music that matches my mood, e.g, if I&#039;m depressed I&#039;m gonna listen to depressive music, go figure.

				I&#039;ve moved away from Happy Hardcore as it only lasts so long without decaying into empty words that aren&#039;t backed by my emotions. I now enjoy some bands that have amazing musicality to match their intense lyrics; they&#039;re on the deathcore/progressive metal side but their songs actually mean something. They speak about societal issues and about how corrupt this world has gotten. Especially if your live force is motivated by making a change in this world and standing against all of the oppression caused by the few people by whom we, as the human race, are controlled.<br /><br />Try some of these Bands-Their Album combos:<br />As Blood Runs Black-Allegiance. Their songs My Fears Have Become Phobias, In Dying Days, and Strife(Chug Chug) are probably my singles favorite of all time.<br />Molotov Solution-The Harbringer.<br />Veil of Maya-[Id]. Amazing riffs and lyrics that go along with a trip<br />Within the Ruins-Invade. My favorite album of all time; listen to the song Ataxia for an amazing instrumental song with a theme of Good vs. Evil that vehemently shows how they fight exist to this very day.

He came up with this therapeutic technique for helping people that had lost all hope that he called Logo Therapy. It was actually a fairly simple process that went something like this:<br /><br />Patient &quot;Man I wish I was dead.&quot;<br /><br />Doctor &quot;So why don&#039;t you go kill yourself than?&quot;<br /><br />The idea of the question is simply that everyone who has not killed themselves has a reason for staying alive and more often than not if they simply focus on that reason they can stop focusing on all the bad stuff. I don&#039;t off myself because it would crush my mom and deny me an opportunity to demonstrate that my life long arrogance was actually there because I do have some meaningful contribution to make to the world as a whole through the unique insight I have on the way we as a people behave. <br /><br />I&#039;m suicidal because of the tedium of daily life. It gets boring. Wake up, brush teeth, drink coffee, pay bills, go to the grocery store, cook food, kiss girlfriend, watch TV, go to sleep, repeat. I have a hard time finding hope in that cycle because it seems to happen over and over and over again. But, with the smallest bit of effort I can throw my laptop in my bag and go somewhere to write for a few hours. I can go meet a pretty girl somewhere and see if she&#039;ll flirt with me or not. I can change the cycle with nothing more than a thought and so I&#039;m not controlled by it or stuck in it, I&#039;m simply most comfortable there and so once I appreciate that I have opted to live my life it&#039;s easier to appreciate that it is the life I want to live.<br /><br />Sorry, in a writting mood today.... guess I should go back up the laptop and go hit on a barista for a while now!

Not that it really means anything or matters, but according to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale version Four, I scored 156 last time. I don&#039;t usually tell people that, but meh. Doesn&#039;t matter anyway.<br /><br />I forget what the percentile was, but it made me pretty depressed. I gave up trying to find a girlfriend would could possibly understand me that day.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone can at least understand how lonely it is knowing that it&#039;s entirely possible no one on the planet could possibly be an even match.<br /><br />It sucks.<br /><br />The biggest thing that depressed me these days is that even though I keep my easily-bored and hungry mind occupied with studying things like steganography, organic chemistry, experimental cryptosystems, and 7 other hobbies which I&#039;d prefer not to mention here, it still feels as though I&#039;m wasting away.<br /><br />I could become so much more, but I just lack any motivation to push myself.<br /><br />Why should I? People have such low expectations, I could be drunk as hell and still pass the bar. It&#039;s just.. why should I work hard to really do great things when all I&#039;ll get is punished for it?<br /><br />I&#039;ll still be alone in the end.<br /><br />EDIT: Actually, I just remembered something my psychiatrist recommended I join, called the Prometheus Society. Mensa is weaksauce compared to Prometheus Society, but my goal is even higher.<br /><br />I searched for more exclusive High IQ Society, and sure enough, one exists: Mega Society.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Guinness Book of World Records stated that the most elite ultra High IQ Society is the Mega Society with percentiles of 99.9999 or 1 in a million required for admission.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To qualify for membership in the Mega Society via the Mega Test, aspirants must earn a score corresponding to an IQ of 171 or more (SD = 15) on a test accepted for admission by the society.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now this sounds promising.

				So honestly, if having an advanced intellect is the burden that you find crushing you down there really is a predictably easy method of passing your time on this planet...<br /><br />Become a mad scientist.<br /><br />Were it not for a near insatiable desire to fondle new breasts I would without a doubt get a degree in bio-chem and plot the destruction of the world. I&#039;ve always been sort of an environmentalist at heart but the whole notion of recycling and sustainable agriculture seems to miss the low hanging fruit which is that there are simply too many people on the planet and the only holistic approach to saving the planet is to construct a pathogen that fixes that issue.<br /><br />It sounds like you are on your way with the chemistry set and all. Now you just need the driving motivation to follow through. I would start with the Flu virus since it&#039;s already a pretty common bug. Set up a dispersal mechanism that utilizes public water systems but ensure that the onset of symptoms don&#039;t manifest for at least 72 hours. Plan it at a time of year when you can ensure dispersal not just through tap water but by infecting mosquito larva that will nest in public water reserves. After that all you need to do is...<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ve never really given it much thought, like I said, I can&#039;t figure out how to destroy humanity but keep all the boobs...<br />&nbsp;

Plan it at a time of year when you can ensure dispersal not just through tap water but by infecting mosquito larva that will nest in public water reserves. After that all you need to do is...<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ve never really given it much thought, like I said, I can&#039;t figure out how to destroy humanity but keep all the boobs...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A swiss or swede(I forget which) scientist already created a virus that could take out at least half of the population. I guess you could shoot for 99%&nbsp; :D

				You know what would be really cool?<br /><br />Creating a super-flu capable of wiping out 99.99% of the human population, deliberately making it obvious that it was designed with performance in mind, without obfuscating the fact that it&#039;s unnatural.<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury, I could include a non-expressed portion of the genetic sequence that&#039;s actually an encoded text file that could be a manifesto.<br /><br />To encode it, I&#039;d use either one base pair, or the other, which makes it more unnatural-looking and obvious that it&#039;s a message intended for the virologists and their employers.<br /><br />I&#039;d express my scorn, hatred and rage in it, and I&#039;d laugh in their faces at their feeble attempts at halting the global epidemic.<br /><br />Anyway, all of this is hypothetical. The only motivation I could have that would cause me to design such a virus is if the last person I loved was killed for any reason.
