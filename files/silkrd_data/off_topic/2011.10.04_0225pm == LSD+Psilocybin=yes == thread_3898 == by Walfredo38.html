				So the old lady and I had some free time the other day and the above drugs.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have all day however but a decent chunk of time to spend.&nbsp; Now I have a stash of Mayan LSD and that day had a nice big shroom leftover from awhile back that measured 2.75 grams.&nbsp; Not enough shrooms for each of us, and I didn&#039;t want to take too much LSD and be flying when I had to be somewhere that night.&nbsp; So we each took a half tab of a 200 microgram Mayan.&nbsp; Enough to feel it only a little.&nbsp; We waited about 1.5 hours then split the large 2.75 gram mushroom between us.&nbsp; About an hour later I was in scientific terms &#039;tripping balls&#039;.&nbsp; The peak lasted almost 3 hours of which the visuals were as intense as if I were fully saturated with LSD.&nbsp; The spiraling snakes in my head were magnificent and just like that 3 hours later they were gone.&nbsp; I was still weird and had an afterglow with huge pupils, but not tripping anymore.&nbsp; I went on about my evening as planned with a sensational 3-4 hour trip with the old lady one lazy fall afternoon.&nbsp; The moral to this story is LSD+shrooms much like LSD+MDMA is amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Hey that sounds nice.<br />I have both on stock Maya/Shrooms. But the shrooms are dried, do you know how much I have to take for reasonable effects?<br />I usually take 1,3-1,5 g of them for a deep trip.

				Tough to tell as we are all different but for reference I&#039;m a fairly large dude over 6&#039; 200+ .&nbsp; I&#039;d compare the peak effects with the LSD+Shroom combo for each individually as equivalent roughly to 300-400 micrograms LSD or probably 2.5-3 grams of shrooms. <br />
