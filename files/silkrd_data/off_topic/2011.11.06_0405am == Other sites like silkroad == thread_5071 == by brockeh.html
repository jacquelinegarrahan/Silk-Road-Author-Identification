				first of all im sorry if this is inappropriate (could be seen as promoting rival sites on SRs forums..)<br /><br />but i only bring it up because i love silkroad so much that if anything ever happened to it i would be devastated, really. if silkroad was in someway shutdown or incapacitated i would love to have somewhere else to go, ive seen casual mentions of other sites/forums that provide the same service as silkroad.<br /><br />if you are or have been on any of them i would really appreciate any general info, even a name to start googling would be awesome but if you want to write a little review that would be awesomer haha<br /><br />how do other places compare in terms of size, security, community, range of products, price?<br /><br />thanks

				BlackMarket Reloaded is exactly like Silk Road, just on a smaller scale.&nbsp; When Silk Road goes down like it has in the past, many people fly over there temporarily.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s great for sellers that aren&#039;t looking to sell huge quantities or make massive profits.&nbsp; The place is pretty solid and deserves more attention than it&#039;s getting.

				I found other sites, during our bit &#039;downtime&#039; period, and I went to BlackMarket, and figured I&#039;d try a couple guys, and neither one came thru, but this was before escrow over there...I had contacted the owner--I didn&#039;t want my money back, just wanted to get a feel for what was up--and I thought he was a decent sort, just kind of learning the business so to speak.&nbsp; The other place I hung round was Online Vendors DataBase OVDB, and they were good, but have a totally different &#039;trust&#039; set up: I prefer escrow...<br /><br />You can google around, and get the onion addresses...I think &#039;the more the merrier&#039; for all kinds of reasons, but this place has the best forums, and the fact they are separate from &#039;main&#039; site is good....this is home, but they go down, then I travel...

				I agree with phubaiblues, SR is problably the most notorious and reliable site there is in the hidden wiki. I&#039;ve been to a lot of the other sites similar and this is as good as it gets, escrow, forums, feedback, resolving order issues. btw Sorry you got burnt Phubai.<br />Heres a few links if you want. Buy at your own risk do not blame me if you get scammed.<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/snapbbs/7ab2eedb/threadlist.php?PHPSESSID=93oti5n9mdogqdokh952me4h57<br /><br />http://okx5b2r76olbriil.onion/<br /><br />http://twkjsdiu4kpvy4ol.onion/<br /><br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/snapbbs/5f89d89a/<br />

				I&#039;ve sold on Black Market, and I might go back to it because I didn&#039;t have all the LE buyers scamming me over there. Maybe they just weren&#039;t paying attention to it yet.<br /><br />

				Personally I first went to Black market first before SR, the deal went bad. The seller just stopped communicating half way through the deal before it was even made. So I came to SR and haven&#039;t had a single problem for the time period that I have been here(2 months). Silk Road is the best that I have used. Plus having it&#039;s own forum with a much larger member base than any other drug forum sites on Tor out there makes it a lot less dodgy and you learn a hell of a lot more about how to go about doing your business here...
