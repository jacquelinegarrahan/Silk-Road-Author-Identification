And now she&#039;s asking me to get her pregnant and we can move in together and get married.<br /><br />What in the all serious fuck is wrong with people. I haven&#039;t responded to the text yet. I mean...the fuck?!

				Then it all comes down to whether or not the sex is worth it. If you wanna lead this girl on just for some easy pussy, which is pretty damn easy these days if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for, then it&#039;s on you. Just know that sex isn&#039;t everything, which is something modern society seems to forget.&nbsp; ;)

				Ha, I was gonna recommend you to get one of your friends in on her. Simple and effective way of ending the problem. Good thinking. She likes batman though? Sounds kinda young... Probably the reason for the clingyness, but not necessarily the craziness.

Translation: You ain&#039;t getting any.<br /><br />Do NOT have sex with her again,do NOT answer or return phone calls, make yourself inaccessible, and send her a very brief e-mail that you simply can no longer &quot;go on living a lie&quot; and that you have come to terms re: embracing your homosexual identity. Thank her for being a very &quot;good friend&quot; for helping you realize this.<br /><br />But make sure you get that fucking comic book first.<br /><br />P.S. My apologies to any of the fine sane,sexy, and single women on SR who 1)enjoy sex and 2)have a sincere interest in comics and collectables and 3)who appreciate good heroin.

				just tell her batman is a huge fag, that blows the joker every chance he gets. i&#039;m sure you can find a toon of that somewhere on the web.&nbsp; show it to her as proof. just keep talking shit, about how big of a pussy batman is, and how you hate him, that you&#039;d beat his bitch ass if given the chance, ect.&nbsp; <br /><br />eventually she&#039;ll start hating you.&nbsp; reverse psychology works every time.

However as an adult who just smoked some killer Sativa I find the notion to be as funny as fuck.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As a kid I grew up watching the Batman t.v. series in the 60&#039;s. It had the very same tongue in cheek 60&#039;s pop-art sensibilities as The Monkey&#039;s. I liked the &quot;Pow!&quot; &quot;Bam!&quot; &quot;Zonk!&quot; exclamation bubble&#039;s that accompanied one of the countless, ridiculous, and highly improbable fighting scenes. It was like a Roy Lichtenstein painting come to life.<br /><br />In retrospect however, I have no doubt&nbsp; that Bat Man and Boy Wonder did a lot more in the Bat Cave then polish their Batmobile. They probably sucked every dick in Gotham City dry... including those of the older queens: like&nbsp; Alfred the butler at Wayne Manor, Commissioner Gordon, and Chief of Police Inspector O&#039;Hara.<br /><br />Anyways, and for the record: Batman and Boy Robin were def a leotard wearing knob gobbling butt munching tag team duo. Not hating anyone here for their sexual orientation: just keeping it real.<br /><br />The only real heterosexual &#039;superhero&#039; (if you can even call him that) was the Incredible Hulk . Unfortunately, as a result of his woefully inadequate anger management skills he had a very difficult time meeting women and getting laid. Consequently he had to resort to the glory holes in&nbsp; the video booths at porn shops where he relied upon the kindness of strangers to satisfy his needs. Although the exact gender of those cocksuckers is still unknown to him it&#039;s pretty safe to say that (contrary to his naive assumption) they weren&#039;t women. But please DON&#039;T ever tell him that. :)<br /><br />**User&#039;s Don&#039;t Lose Drug&#039;s!!**

				Hi Ali,<br /><br />It&#039;s a difficult question - of course when it comes to the sphere of crime I&#039;m afraid to say my gender are rather over represented but we shouldn&#039;t assume the same is true for SR!<br /><br />Pine&#039;s knowledge of IT Security and Cryptography is very profound and they are topics which are traditionally masculine but of course there&#039;s no reason (s)he couldn&#039;t be a very gifted lady with an interest in the dark net. I fancy I&#039;m going to be called a chauvinist pig if I go on any longer so will shut up now. :-D<br /><br />The prospect of playing a woman online was something that never occurred to me until I saw some people did this on Facebook while pretending to be Superheroes - it&#039;s a strangely liberating thought to think that Supergirl might actually be some bearded scrote in a wifebeater vest wiping gravy off his keyboard...<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22237.msg234950#msg234950">Quote from: aligibbs on May 11, 2012, 09:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Quote from: TravellingWithoutMoving on May 10, 2012, 10:06 PM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...Silk Road dating agency<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ??!<br /><br />:-D What&#039;s the gender balance on here?!<br /><br />V.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, V! :)<br /><br />I&#039;d wondered the same thing - there&#039;s a tendency for men to want to &#039;play&#039; women online that there isn&#039;t for women so I&#039;ve often wondered if some of the people I think are women (Holly, etc.) could be guys (interestingly, women almost always choose women - unless they&#039;re lesbians and playing a game, in which case they play men so they can get the chick -- I read a study on it :-|)...and, we might as well break out the obvious one - I&#039;m on the fence about Pine - although I hope they&#039;re female, we need to represent :)<br /><br />lol @ dating agency....if only - it&#039;s surprisingly difficult to find guys who are into the same things as me and not socially retarded...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
