				Hi<br /><br />I got two letters send to a dummy name I use for silk road business (just my real name with spelling mistake). It says.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Greetings<br /><br />We take the opportunity with this letter to inform you that we have sent you some medicine in the past. We are drop-shippers for several sellers on torrent (I guess he means tor) and other online Pharmacies. If you are intrested to order directly from us at a cheaper price kindly email us at <br /><br />****@lavabit.com<br /><br />and we will send you our price list<br /><br />Truly yours,<br />****<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When i used to order from Larghetto (before he vanished with my cash) I used to receive his product from the Philippines... Has anyone else got a letter like this? What to make of this (besides the fact that my personal info is in a file somewhere in the Philippines...).<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve never received a letter like that myself.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve also never ordered anything from the Philippines.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty picky about ordering domestic only so crazy shit like this doesn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; I would maybe e-mail them and tell them to lose your address?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know but it&#039;s definitely disconcerting that your info is floating around somewhere out there being associated with god knows what.

				Look Dan, steroids aren&#039;t fucking cheap. I&#039;ve been holed up in the Phillippines for months trying to bring back this pill business from the dark side of the moon. <br /><br />Needless to say, I&#039;ve been distracted by the fine selection of hooers here and I&#039;ve been rather lazy about contacting clients. Turns out these fuckers had a whole room full of client contact information, so one day I tooted about 2.6 grams of this islander speed and went to town. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t realize it would effect people on SR, my bad my dude

				ppl come to SR and have no idea who they are dealing with. I get harassed 10 years later, to this day, by people i dont know, in countries/businesses I used to make lots of people money in. If a telemarketer in india will call random ass people all day long tying to sell a few bucks worth of crap, what makes you think organised criminals dont have headhunters, with access to ELABORATE databases, with probable leads to grow their income? Faking death isnt enough for some of these groups.

				What I think happened is the vendor you ordered product from in the past had said product drop shipped by another seller. The actual shipper is sending you a letter saying, hey, FYI, the product you ordered was drop shipped, we are the actual seller, so if you buy directly from us, we can give you a better price.

				I don&#039;t care my personal address ending up in a DB somewhere. I don&#039;t have huge amounts of shit lying around anyway and just because your address is in a DB it doesn&#039;t give LE anything because phishing happens all the time. I contacted the guys anonymously and told them to set up their shit right with tor, bitcoin, escrow and PGP. At the moment they only accept western union, so only crazies are going to order.<br /><br />I must say, he looks legit. I asked for details on the product and i&#039;m 100% sure HE/SHE was the one getting me the cheap adderall I got here on SR.<br /><br />His price for 70x20mg adderall&nbsp; is $200 (on the road you pay at least 3x as much).&nbsp;

				Well, as you know adderall is a combo of <br /><br />amphetamine aspartate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />amphetamine sulfate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />dextroamphetamine saccharate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />and dextroamphetamine sulfate<br /><br />The pills they are pressing just contain the most active of this component. As I used it, it felt like clean speed in low and correct dosage. In my opinion, the main reason why adderall is a combo of one potent stimulant and three less potent stimulant was to get it FDA approved and for marketing purposes (public opinion).<br /><br />In comparison to real adderall they feel the same (potency,&nbsp; side effects, tolerance buildup, etc). In the past I got one tested by estacydatabase.org and they passed and amphetamine without other adulterants.<br /><br />I think they are pressed for the black market but in a professional lab.
