				If you were gonna kill yourself, what drug / drug combo would you use? I hear heroin is nice. I overdid it on MXE once, because of a number of really stupid factors, but i basically started to get a little high and then just completely blacked out. Stimulants seem a terrible way to go. Old school way, of course, was barbiturates with booze. So let&#039;s say you have a terminal illness and you want to end it sooner rather than later. How&#039;re you gonna exit?

				On MDPV I could calmly think about the most horrible shit in detail from my childhood like being raped and shit. So I figure on MDPV I could calmly kill myself, I could take 500mg of MDPV and obsess about why I shouldn&#039;t be alive and just wipe myself out with a knife or razor. I don&#039;t even think the pain would bother me with the horrible shit I do to my overdryed penis on MDPV having five hour wank sessions on it.<br /><br />MDPV seems like the way.<br /><br />But I love life.

I was going to give you +1 for the good joke you made about onion.to over on another thread, then I was going to give you -1 for the Austrian Economics thread you&#039;re trying to start. Now I&#039;m just depressed and going to bed.

				I&#039;m having a hard time wrapping my brain around the way you used &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;way to go&quot; in the same sentence. <br />People dont kill themselves because its fun.<br />but people can die accidently while theyre having fun, like&nbsp; OD&#039;ing on heroin or drink driving.<br /><br />
