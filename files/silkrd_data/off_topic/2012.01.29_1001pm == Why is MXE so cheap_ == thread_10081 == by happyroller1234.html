				I&#039;ve read that it can be an awesome drug, so why is it so fucking cheap compared to Ketamine?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing because it&#039;s easier to get/synthesize?&nbsp; $16-$30 a gram seems too good to be true.<br /><br />

				Just remember it&#039;s not ketamine, it is a great drug though. Plus remember that while it&#039;s $15-30/g, you also need only about half the dose you would need for ketamine, and it lasts 2-3 times longer. I&#039;d assume it&#039;s easier/cheaper to make, and it&#039;s still legal which makes it quite a bit cheaper.

				Because it&#039;s legal in most places. The reason drugs cost as much as they do is because you&#039;re paying people to risk serious jailtime to get them to you.

				It&#039;s not technically legal. It&#039;s grey area at best. I could elaborate on why this is, but honestly I don&#039;t want to give LE any ideas. To say the least, the common argument that it&#039;s legal because it was derived from Ketamine (which is schedule III), and that schedule III substances aren&#039;t included in the Analogue Act, would NOT hold up to a sharp prosecutor.

The 2c&#039;s are mescaline analogs, and are &quot;more&quot; illegal if you will because they fall under the analog act. As far as I know, nobody really cares much about the analog act. But MXE is closer to the legal side of the grey area by being a ketamine analog, but it is also a PCP analog so it&#039;s hard to say for sure. Despite all of this, if you get a suspicious/unmarked letter containing nothing more than a gram of white powder, what do you think is going to happen?
