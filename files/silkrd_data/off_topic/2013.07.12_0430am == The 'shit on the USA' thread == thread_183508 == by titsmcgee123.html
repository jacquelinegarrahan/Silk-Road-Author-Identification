				I just want to create a thread on how shitty of a country the USA is. I am an american, but I can;t fucking stand it here. I really wish it was easy to move to the EU. This country is so fucking corrupt, if you have money or are born into a wealthy family you are set, but if you were born into a poor family you are doomed. That is the sad reality - we are in another gilded age (for those of you not familiar with the term, it was the late 1800s/early 1900s) where the rich have all the money and control the country. The only difference is that now a days the bribes/connections/extortion is better hidden than it was back then. Also, a majority of the population actually believes the bullshit propaganda the MSM spreads by way of the government. I truly wish the gov&#039;t would be overthrown, but it will never happen - they are too powerful.<br />All you foregin folk, and citizens that are fed up with this bullshit country feel free to add your criticisms/rants about this bullshit plutocracy that we live in.

				I am not going to shit on my country. I will most happily rain a shit storm down upon those apathetic cunt faced slackers who don&#039;t vote, don&#039;t educate themselves about their rights and responsibilities when it comes to being a functional tax paying member of our society. <br /><br />There is nothing wrong with the good ol USA that murdering about 20-30 million people wouldn&#039;t eliminate. Every single perpetrator convicted with DNA evidence of sex crimes against children, dead. Convicted of rape, or any violent sexual offense with DNA evidence, their air breathing days have come to an end. Then take out any of those convicted of profiting from or running ponzi schemes, like ENRON, like the STANFORD GROUP, they have forfeited their place among the living. <br /><br />Kill those convicted of murdering children with abuse and neglect. I am very much in favor of completely revamping and standardizing the criminal injustice system here. That is in my not so humble opinion the real travesty and waste of funds in the US. <br /><br />Prosecution of drug crimes needs to come to a complete halt. So much of our resources are tied up in this futile endeavor, that only serves to empower the rich and entitled elite ruling class. Fuck them, and fuck that. <br /><br />Make abortions and birth control government subsidized, for those that lack the financial capacity to afford it themselves. I think that our government should offer a bonus for any of our citizens that wish to be sterilized while they are still fertile, or their sperm is viable. <br /><br />The repatriation of of taxable income from offshore manufacturing, NOW!!<br /><br />That is my start list of how to improve the standard of living, safety, and security in the US.
