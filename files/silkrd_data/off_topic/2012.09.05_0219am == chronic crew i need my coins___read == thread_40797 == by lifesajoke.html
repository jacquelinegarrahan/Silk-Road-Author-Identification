You need to leave and never come back and if someone has scammed you, good on them ;D. It sucks when the shoe&#039;s on the other foot, doesn&#039;t it. :P

				EVERYONE knows the details you moron. You dont recall your mea culpa you posted yesterday or the day before ?<br /><br />Please just get over it. I mean in all seriousness besides the hate I have for you .. why do you think you can attempt to rip a dude off twice, admit to ripping off bunches of other people and then return to the site and ask for a on the level deal to be completed ? As the saying goes, &quot;You play in the mud, you wake up dirty&quot;.

				Wow, I really want to get addicted to Xanax after reading all your posts over the last few days.<br /><br />You seem like someone with a lot of respect for themselves who really has their shit together. Your parents must be so proud!&nbsp; :)

				CC if you read this, please DO NOT give him any of his coin. I&#039;m a pretty fair guy, i understood it presented you with a dilemma at first.<br />But this guy dude.... I dont think anyone who&#039;s on these forum wants you to give him any coin.<br />If you do he wont stop with his shit anyway, it will only give him more means.<br />I dont believe anything he writes, its all bs, i dont even think this guy uses (alot of) drugs. He&#039;s here todo what he&#039;s doing, scam, spam, trying to get a rise out of as many people he can. For some reason he hates this place and anyone on it and want to get at us any way he can, which he is doing.<br />Doing anything else but ignoring him is playing right into his game, so plz keep the coin and ignore the fucker.<br /><br />just my 2c

				I&#039;m gonna post this thread to Drug Safety as proof that long term use of benzos is bad.<br /><br />That is if this scammer isn&#039;t just some nigerian prince, which is also possible judging by his awkward use of American English.
