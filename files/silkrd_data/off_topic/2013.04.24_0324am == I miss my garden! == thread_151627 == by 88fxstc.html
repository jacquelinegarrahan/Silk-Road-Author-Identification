				I used to have a beautiful indoor garden for growing weed. This is going back beginning in&nbsp; the mid-late 90&#039;s and I grew for a good decade. Man do I miss that, even though I don&#039;t smoke weed as much as I once did, I miss having the absolute best, and the variety as far as smell, taste, effect, looks, that was just an awesome hobby. I had the best weed in my area, not one of the areas more known for growing so most of the folks around me at the time just didn&#039;t have access to the quality I had. Certain life issues forced me to stop. I had some beauty strains, original Brothers Grimm c-99, some nice original Vic High strains, Killer Queen being my favoirite of his,some really nice Reeferman stuff from his earlier days B4 his business nosedived, and many more plus some nice clone only&#039;s.&nbsp; Hell, I still have a 75+- packs of seeds in my fridge in case I can ever start back up.&nbsp; Some day.........some day.. ::)&nbsp; I can still dream!

				So , for any of you growers reading this, what were/are your favorite strains to grow? I&#039;m talkin seeds, not clone only elite&#039;ss / Seeds that were/are available from one of the well known breeders that were available to all, not a rare, hard to source strain that was only available to those who knew the right people.<br />Favorite strain?????? Favorite breeder?????<br /><br />My favorite strainstrains that I GREW was<br />- Joey Weeds AK99<br />- Brothers Grimm C99,Apollo 11<br />- Rezdog&#039;s Sour Queen<br />-Reefermans Viper, Mango and Blue Thunder<br />-DJ&#039;s&nbsp; Blueberry<br />-Bog&#039;s - BogBubble,&nbsp; Sour Bubble<br />- Shanti&#039;s - White Widow<br />-Metal Haze , can&#039;t remember the breeder

				Uh, growers here.&nbsp; <br /><br />We made our own strain from Blueberry and OG Kush seeds. It&#039;s been four generations from seed now. <br />So we called it kushberry when people ask.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some purple leaves and its large producer.&nbsp; The stink is just stupid. <br /><br />Before this we had white rhino and early girl.&nbsp; They were great, but tiny little dwarf plants with rock hard nuggets.<br />We did hose outdoors too, but had mold problems in the thick buds and it spread fast. <br /><br />We are excited to try out a few new strains for sale here on the road.&nbsp; That Barney&#039;s farm LSD strain is just killer.<br />I bought the red diesel from Mrouid Canada vendor, it was very unique. <br /><br />Our indoor setup is two large rooms , veg and flower. We got a work area for trimming and smoking, mixing up food. Our canister air filters work awesome. Not a smell in or outside.<br />We cut clones once a month and keep a cycle in three stages of growth. So there is always a crop to cut each month or so. <br /><br />Trimming is the part you must remember hating? <br />I dread it each month.&nbsp; It&#039;s not something you can hire people for really. <br />We get through it by taking breaks to clean the hash off the scissors and fingers to smoke it. It&#039;s always deadly when it&#039;s fresh resin like that. wet and gooey for hot knives. <br /><br />You should do a garden outside.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy and fun summer project.&nbsp; Very rewarding. <br /><br />

My part of the country is notorious for mold issues though and our season isn&#039;t that long. I just need the right strain for my location. I actually have some of Reef&#039;s Nigerian Nightmare beans that I know will finish nice where I live as thats the strain I grew that other time. The seeds are old but I bet I could get a few to pop.They&#039;ve been refrigerated this whole time.
