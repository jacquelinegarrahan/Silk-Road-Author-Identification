				As topic says just want to know what people think of them, or had any dealings with them?<br /><br />I am from Derry and its flooded with them up this way, i am Irish and personally i think there the scum of the earth i was recently watching a documentary when they went to Amsterdam to kill British soldiers and killed two innocent Aussies fucking terrible and when you hear and see the victims Family&#039;s story&#039;s it&#039;s terrible.<br /><br />Just curious of what anyone thinks of them, good or bad replies all welcome, just thought i would see what people think.<br /><br />If this topic upsets or annoys anyone i am sorry i never made it to upset anyone.

				I was in London when they bombed that shopping mall in the 90&#039;s fucking terrorfying and i dont believe thats the right way to get what they want, blowing up innocent people is just fucking cowardly they have a problem with the brithish government/monarchy take it out on them. And before anyone says yes i knoe they kill soldiers in ireland all the time but they have no power they cant say fine have your country back and shit theyve got like 75% of it so whats the big deal ooh im catholic yout protastant blah blah blah theyre both cristianity just slightly different its like orthodox/non-orthodox jew killing each other that would never happen they have the muslims to kill <br />So all in all i understand what they want, think they will never get it and the only wat to get it is a different aproach

				I don&#039;t agree with what they do but saying they have no power is seriously wrong, back in the day Gaddafi supplied the IRA with all kinds of weapons to use on the British, the IRA have serious links and are very dangerous people if you read about them you will see they have contacts all over the place, they were even training the Columbians back in the day.

				I think we should distinguish between the old Provisional IRA (now dis-armed) who have signed up for the peace process, and those republican groups (Continuity IRA, Real IRA) who continue with their, now very limited, campaign of violence. <br />Also, the loyalist paramilitaries (UDA, LVF) were equally brutal in their own way, even if they were on the side of the UK. And I think there was a lot of anti-Catholic discrimination in Northern Ireland to make the IRA believe what they were doing was right. And, of course, the British have hardly covered themselves in glory over the centuries in Ireland, another reason for the violence.<br />It&#039;s crazy to think that it was only 20 years ago that these things were happening, in a developed Western country. I do believe though that, if the majority of Northern Irish want to remain part of the UK, then so be it.

				There was once an IRA now its full of scum just money racking i thought they were against drugs? taking drug dealers is again drugs? there the scum of the earth and soon they will realise everyone is against them.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone read about it but if i can remember correctly an IRA man was shot dead in Dublin a couple of months back for extorting drug dealers a few years ago you would not hear of an IRA man being shot by a drug dealer.<br /><br />The sooner the better people realise the IRA in todays world is only a name tag because it scares people of the horror they caused years ago.<br /><br />Thanks for the replies so far just thought it would be an interesting thread

				Yeah, from what I know the old Provos have now just become an organized criminal syndicate, supposedly protecting communities from criminal activity which they themselves have a large stake in.<br />Mind you, again the UDA etc fulfill much the same role in Belfast these days, so they&#039;re both as bad as each other IMO.

				As Garricha said its the old real IRA that had some limited power but now these break off group anyone can say im IRA no organisation no real plan and by no power i ment they were never going to win there freedom by bombing some shops schools and the rest when i was over there it was the 90&#039;s at the peak my parents wouldnt let us go any further into the city then where we lived we could only go outwards for the fear they struck in people thats gone now English rome where they please no fear of IRA bombs (seems do have to worry about muslims with machetes )<br />&nbsp;The IRA would extort money from anyone to fund there cause drug dealers included the difference now is the drug dealers arnt scared of these people claiming they are &quot;IRA&quot; because no one will go after them for revenge <br /><br />This is also what shits me about Americans thinking they are the first western country to suffer from terrorism UK been at it for 30+yrs ban guns oops IRA still had guns. Have security check points that infringed on peoples rights oops IRA still got bombs and guns through them <br />You cant fight terrorism with rules and regulations
