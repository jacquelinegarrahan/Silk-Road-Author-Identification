				Just wondering if anyone has heard of a program called bitcoin flipper.&nbsp; supposedly it doubles your bitcoin amount, because BTC is a digital currency, computers can manipulate it&#039;s code and randomizes a new code and creates a bitcoin for you.&nbsp; IDK sounds too good to be true.&nbsp; They say it&#039;s just like mining.&nbsp; Anyone try it out?&nbsp; I&#039;m not too fond of &quot;new&quot; technology that just pops up outta nowhere.&nbsp; The download link is below, just afraid to pull the trigger. lol<br /><br />*please use caution and do not download this link! it is likely to be a virus or wallet stealer* - edited by miRNA<br />http://speedy.sh/4ZpU7/Bitcoin-Miner-Doubler.exe

				Looks to good to be true and therefore probably is.<br />It also looks fishy as fuck.. Just .exe and no program for Macs.<br />Anyways I won&#039;t be trying it but would be nice if it worked! :)

				As much as it pains me to say it - anyone who tries this deserves what it does, most likely empty your wallet.

				Bitcoins are mined by solving an algorithm. This program makes no sense if you have the BTC that means it was an answer to the block chain.<br /><br />This is as stupid as mtgix

				Pretty cheesy attempt at social engineering with the paragraph included.&nbsp; None the less this is obviously an attempt to steal some wallets and I&#039;m sure there are plenty of people that have already fell victim.<br /><br />Shit&#039;s malware, nuff said.
