Though it seems incredibly likely that you are actually &#039;cktwo&#039;, can you point out the reasoning behind calling me a &#039;dick&#039; and an &quot;internet tough guy&quot;?&nbsp; ??? I merely pointed out the logical fallacy in cktwo&#039;s post. That is not being an &quot;internet tough guy&quot;, it is employing logic and basic reasoning skills to point out why the suggestion in the original post is an incredibly stupid one.<br /><br />Either you two go to the same school - one in which they cannot spell the word &quot;you&quot; correctly, nor capitalise, nor teach basic grammar skills - or else you&#039;re one and the same. A realisation that makes your talking to yourself slightly worrying. Perhaps you should go get help of some sort?&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I understand where you are coming from, as the suggestions he made WERE totally bizarre (not to mention I couldn&#039;t even understand what he was trying to ask), but feel that it was summed up nicely by your little microwave anecdote and that the rest of your post was somewhat excessive.<br /><br />Back on-topic.. yeah, this is just food for flaming or trolling. To have a vendor give out their address and receive drugs from buyers, just, what? If we had drugs, why would we be buying!? Furthermore, the possibility of selective scamming is significantly higher with such a set-up; vendors could rack up buyers to send them their &#039;proving-we&#039;re-not-feds&#039; drugs and bolt. The site has had its share of selective, or total, scammers already and adding a feature such as this would just make it easier for fakes to rip off genuine customers. It&#039;s a horrible idea, and I&#039;m going to forget that it was ever mentioned.

				it often surprises me how &quot;v intelligent people&quot; completely miss the point unless its laid out in an xyz fashion. also how so many drug taking dudes can be so anal.... but beside that let me break this down for u so u can have an idea about what i wanted to spit ball about...<br /><br />before that let me apologise for my terrible grammar and for calling GG a sad cunt thats not my style normally.... u jus annoyed me w ur ridciularse prancing and had u just pointed out my stupid prose instead of trying to ur flex &quot;logic&quot; muscles i wouldve realised, cleaned it up and we couldve discussed it together like grown men w ur big boy logic...<br /><br />to all the internet pussies that think they&#039;re big bad boys and girls cos they&#039;ve ordered some drugs of the net and moved in to a shit boy new apartmen,t having just cut ur lil boy penis strings - well done now suck my dick. ive bought from here in over 100&#039;s and dealt many a drug irl and been very very successful but thats a diff story...<br /><br />now to break this down nice n easy<br /><br />say i am a vendor and someone wants to order some goods from me in bulk but i think that the other person is customs trying to find out my big man stealth or if i was going to deal w someone dealing big goods and worried that this other person is a fed. then what they could do is ask the buyer to send some drugs to a drop point, to a buddy, to a random who theyve agreed w over a forum, to a dude who lives nr a test center, i dunno go figure.... this would be similar to someone on the street being asked to take a snort to prove theyre not fed. cos as far as i know le cant provide drugs for whatever reason.<br /><br />now again this was jus to have a simple convo and hopefully share knowledge ( cos i love being a knowledge sharer) . i dont expect u to start living ur life w this mantra nor did i think so many stupid haters were gonna jump out the wood works n start some stupidity, but i guess thats my fault for going online and not expecting big boys surfing their hard man keyboards.... i bet even if u like the idea, see truth or point to it u wont +1 it because the world esp the internet is full of hater who love to criticize to try and make themselves feel big. y not try feel big by standing on ur own two feet?<br /><br />stay bliss my lovelies : )
