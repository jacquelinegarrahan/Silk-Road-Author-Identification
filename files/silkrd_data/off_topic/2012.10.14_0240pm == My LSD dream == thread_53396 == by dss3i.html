				I had almost forgotten about this when I woke up, but now I remember. Last night I had some lucid dreaming. Recently I purchased some LSD and apparently in my dream I was taking it. I was with mom and the two of us were attending a party with several rooms. My relatives were there as well as my friends. In the beginning the dream wasn&#039;t yet lucid. I saw patterns of everything and the colors were beautiful. The only thing was that I was slightly worried that my relatives at the party would notice that I was high on drugs, but I didn&#039;t care much. At one point I lost contact with the world and had to lie down in a bed with my sitter next to me. Right now I can only describe the bed experience as a black hole, but there were several levels of awareness and consciousness in it. When I returned into myself I went to a table and realized that mom was gone. I told everyone &quot;silence&quot; and then I asked my uncle and sitter where she was. They said that she is in a bed in another room, and that my other friend is sitting her. At this point I started thinking about how much LSD I had given mom, and I realized that I couldn&#039;t remember taking any LSD with her. I then remembered that the LSD I have bought wouldn&#039;t be enough for the two of us, hence, this must be a dream! There was a burn in my head and I experienced joy that I still have my blotters and that my first special time with LSD is yet to occur. Upon this I went into lucid dreaming state. I explored the house, the people and the patterns of blue stars for a little while, and that&#039;s all I can remember. :) :) :)

Sometimes more often and sometimes not at all. I can&#039;t control it or anything.
