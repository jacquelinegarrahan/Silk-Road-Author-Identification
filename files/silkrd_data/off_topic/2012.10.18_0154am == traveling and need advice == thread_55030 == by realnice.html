				&nbsp;Why don&#039;t you just mail them to yourself?<br /><br />If you&#039;re still interested in taking them on the plane, it would be helpful to know what kind of pills they are. My guess is MDMA. And my guess is they&#039;re probably in fun shapes that aren&#039;t conveniently similar to popular chewable vitamins. And they&#039;re probably purple, or blue, or something fun like that.<br /><br />After recently learning the (unbelievably) stiff penalties for posession of amphetamine in my jurisdiction, I&#039;ve taken greater measures to conceal my posession. I&#039;ve been taking herbal suppliment capsules, emptying them out, mixing my amphetamine with the herbs, and then re-capping them. It&#039;s usually a pretty small quantity of amph, so there&#039;s no noticible color change. I keep them in the original bottle. Maybe something like this could suit your fancy? <br /><br />But perhaps the x-rays at the airport will notice the different densities in the pills and alarms will be raised? I don&#039;t know. Are you going to be able to be cool while walking through the airport carrying drugs? Remember that these people are trained to look for nervousness and suspicious behavior. All it takes is one TSA agent smelling something fishy, and the game is up. Sounds like more trouble than it&#039;s worth.<br /><br />You should probably just put them up your butt. <br /><br />The body scanners are meant to look beneath your clothes, not your skin. Rectal insertion is a tried-and-true method of drug smuggling. People have been doing this shit (pardon the pun) for as long as there have been borders.

				Tuck it between your cheeks and not up the ass and deny the x-ray.&nbsp; They&#039;ll give you a lovely feel up but they don&#039;t stick their hands near your ass.&nbsp; They will brush up against your ballsack so don&#039;t stash it under the berries just in case.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a problem denying the xray and getting the free molestation haha.&nbsp; If you&#039;re checking a bag just toss it in there, no problem.&nbsp; Just be sure to seal it up real good in case they have the drug beagles running around that day.
