				&quot;Conspiracy to commit a crime&quot;. That&#039;s a catch-all charge if I&#039;ve ever seen one.<br /><br />Also, 27 kilos of MDMA, wow that&#039;s going to be some time.<br /><br /><br />

				They view MDMA (one of the safest drugs) on par with heroin too, you know pure evil in their eyes.<br /><br />You know what the one single loophole around conspiracy is (in the US)? It has to be two or more people. With two or more people you can get 20 years just for talking about maybe one day trying to sell illegal drugs. With only one person though they have to actually get evidence on you doing something in progress because by law the definition of conspiracy is two or more people. That is why I never ever ever partner, even if just someone stamping my packages, because the second it is more then one person they need NOTHING to put you behind bars. Conspiracy laws are the most fucked up and totalitarian laws on the book in the US. They basically are a free card to imprison anyone anytime the government wants with no evidence.

				I agree that it was a waste, and the drug war is fucking stupid but lets be honest guys. If someone has 27kg of MD there probably is a legit conspiracy to supply/sell charge. The laws fucked up but you can&#039;t really claim personal use on that amount.

				we all know that they weighed the pills and labeled it as all mdma. and considering that they have that many pills they are probably pressies. more like 1.5kg of mdma in the pressies. :P Hell, maybe the powder was some mdma and the rest binders. cops wont test all dem bags. still though... damn

If someone approaches you and ask if you can secure some drugs to sell then you are now convicted of a conspiracy and are looking at 20 years. I am not making this up. I know of (from a news article) a gas station attendant who got convicted of I think it was 20 years for conspiracy for merely answering yes to a DEA informant (who was fishing for busts since he knew no one legitimate) that he could get a kilo of cocaine. The attendant had no drug ties whatsoever and was proven that he was just trying to look like a tough guy but by answering yes to the informants request for drugs he entered into an agreement with another person to provide illegal narcotics and was hence guilty of a conspiracy. Here is a copy and paste from a lawyers website:<br /><br />&quot;What is a drug conspiracy?<br /><br />Most people have no idea how little evidence of involvement it takes for the government to obtain an indictment under the federal drug conspiracy statutes. Title 21 U.S.C. § 846, 841(b)(1)(A)(ii); and Title 18 U.S.C. § 2. By the same token, the extremely harsh penalties come as an unwelcome surprise to those who find themselves named as a defendant.<br /><br />Firstly, in order to be convicted of drug conspiracy the government need only prove: First, that the alleged conspiracy existed; and Second, that the defendant knowingly became a member of the conspiracy with intent to further the conspiracy. The government need not prove that you ever actually possessed any cocaine, marijuana, heroin, or whatever drug is charged. The government need not even prove that you ever actually did anything in furtherance of the conspiracy- only that you became a member with intent to further the conspiracy.<br /><br />Additionally, you need not be a member of the conspiracy for the entire time that it existed. Rather, if, at any point during the existence of the conspiracy, you become a member you are responsible for all of the drugs that were handled by the conspiracy that were reasonably foreseeable to you.&quot;

A good majority of people ended up getting strip searched and they found no drugs. How the fuck can this even be justified in an apparent democratic country?

				^^ frisk and search law is no longer applied in america they use to be able to do it in NY.<br /><br />They were caught because the dumb ass broke into another apartment and left a trail of blood. Im just wondering who leaves drugs out in plain view and opens the door to the police while doing so?? They deserve to be locked up if they are that dumb.
