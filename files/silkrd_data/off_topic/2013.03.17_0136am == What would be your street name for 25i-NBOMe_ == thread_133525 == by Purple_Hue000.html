				&nbsp;what do you call 25i-nbome? or any of the NBOMe&#039;s really. I&#039;ve been exploring this chemical lately and I still can&#039;t put a name to the beautiful substance 25i. <br />what do you think of the NBOMes?

				I generally refer to the whole category as N-bombs, but I always make sure to differentiate between specific chems. <br />I believe this topic was brought up in another thread, possibly the official discussion thread. A point was made that slang terms can differ between regions and cause confusion, in the case of N-bombs potentially fatal since it IS possible to OD on them and the different variations have different dosages.

I agree. But with the comparison aside I&#039;m thinking that the nbome&#039;s have some positive to them. People take the nbomes with an acid trip in mind and usually inexperienced people would never tell the difference between LSD and 25i. But people should take the NBOMe Experience as it is rather than take an nbome and compare it to LSD. If we&#039;re all intellectual enough to be a part of a community and marketplace like this, I&#039;m sure were&#039; also smart enough to know how to stay away from NBOMe.

				I&#039;m a NBOMe fan - Tyl3r&#039;s combo caps anyway. Just refer to them as (phonetically) gnomes. However a mate suggested (Noam) Chomskys - I like that

				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />First off, apologies for spamming. I hope we&#039;re not stepping on any toes. Just searched the top 30 25i threads to try and find some of our old customers..<br /><br />Our 25i-NBOMe 1000ug blotters are back. They moved from our old page Googleyed to our new page GoogleyedXL. Please come and check them out. Prices are great. We need your support to get a bit of positive feedback going! 10% extra included in each purchase through the month of March.<br /><br />Thanks. And much joy to all.<br /><br />Kind regards, GoogleyedXL

				oh yeah I can definitely vouch for GoogleyedXL!! I actually just recently received 10g of 25i-NBOMe from him and they&#039;re an excellent vendor! Also really clean product. I&#039;ve been laying my own 25i blotters and have been reselling the nbome as nbome cause there&#039;s actually a demand and a circle of users over here around nbome consumption.
