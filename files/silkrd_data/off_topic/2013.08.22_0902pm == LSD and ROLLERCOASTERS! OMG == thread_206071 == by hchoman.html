				A couple days ago I traveled to the most popular amusement park east of the mississippi. I love riding rollercoasters and have my whole life and have been to this particular place many times. One of my bucket list items was to combine a day of thrill rides and LSD. The morning of, I retrieved my stash of blotters from various vendors and knowing how important dosage and quality would be for such a wild day. Seeing as how I would be with a group of people (some family) I needed just enough for a good time, but still able to function without detection. After careful consideration, I decided to go with 1 approx 130ug White Lightning tab from TheDrugFederation, as I was very pleased with my previous experiences with this product.<br />So I dropped about 11am and entered the park around noon. The come up was a little uncomfortable as I am surrounded by many loud noises and lots of people. I was the only one in my group to not ride the first coaster, I just told them I needed more time for my lunch to settle but I just wanted the L to settle in first because I had one of those &quot;what did I do&quot; moments. As they rode I settled my breathing and did my best to relax. <br />Off to ride #2, still feeling a tad uneasy I decided to give it a go as this ride was not real intense. It was amazing! From there it was all pure bliss. We moved on to other rides and every single one I had the feeling I was flying. Words cannot describe what going up 200 feet, straight down, multiple inversions and pure coaster speed feels like on LSD! We rode lots of rides that day, even the new one and stayed til the park closed at 9pm. I was still feeling the effects when we left pretty good for 9 hours in. After a couple hour ride home I was still not back to baseline, but was exhausted. I took a 10mg Valium and a nice hot shower and went to bed, awoke the next day feeling like a million bucks.<br />This day will definitely be one to remember. This isn&#039;t for the weak or faint of heart, I would only suggest experienced trippers try this. Like I said earlier, know your body and how it reacts to different doses because I would figure too strong of a dose would be too much to handle. Sunglasses helped hide my dilated pupils and having my iPod helped for waiting in lines which was the worst part of the day.<br />Cannot wait to do this again!&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve always wanted to try this, but the thing that always makes me not try it, is thinking about how bad the lines will suck.&nbsp; 4 hours in a line for a 2 minute coaster... on LSD. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Could you imagine an LSD sky-dive?

				That&#039;s what the ipod is for, or you can always go to the amusement park on a weekday when it wouldn&#039;t be very busy.<br /><br />You just blew my mind by they way with the skydiving comment.

				It is fun to do stuff like that on LSD. The feeling of danger with the knowledge you are safe.

				We went on a Monday, most schools in the area had started and it was about 80 degrees so it was a perfect day. A couple good rides we waited for about 45 minutes but most were around 15-20 minutes but I can definitely see how waiting for hours in line could be a major buzzkill (especially if you get stuck in line by annoying kids). I would also pop in my earbuds as soon as the ride got going so each ride also had its own personal soundtrack. Really truly an amazing experience. One thing I did notice that was different was usually while going down a big hill you get that dropping butterfly feeling in your gut, well I did not experience that feeling at all. It&#039;s hard to put a finger on, but while the L seriously intensified the rides it also gave me an overwhelming sense euphoria.

				I have rode roller coasters rolling before and once while high on pot brownies. Roller coasters are fucking awesome when one is not of a level head. The time I was rolling on roller coasters me n my buddies also managed to get our g-pen in. I must try tripping next time. I agree however that doses cannot be high or you risk sticking out. Especially when tripping. Glad you had fun though.<br /><br />Protip: wooden roller coasters ALWAYS have the shortest lines

				I once road rollercoasters at an amusement park with my cousin while we both microdosed MDMA; 50mg each. It was absolutely fantastic! The biggest issue was that we talked obnoxiously loud about obnoxious topics, but hey- life&#039;s short!<br /><br />I&#039;d absolutely love to try LSD on a rollercoaster. The main reason I haven&#039;t is that I&#039;ve never done acid in public and would be concerned how I&#039;d behave and react.
