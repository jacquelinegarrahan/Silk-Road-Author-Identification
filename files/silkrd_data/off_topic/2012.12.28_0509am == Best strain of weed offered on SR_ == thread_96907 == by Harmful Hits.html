				What vendor had the best weed you got off Silk Road and what strain was it?<br /><br />During my travels down Silk Road I have had the pleasure of sampling at least a dozen strains from many good vendors. The best strain I have bough from SR was LA Confidential from Meganugs. The strain was grown amazingly well, something that you just cant replicate without spending top dollar on equipment and having skilled growers throughout the grow. Meganugs was only on SR for a short time before he left. <br /><br />I love to try great weed so please share your favorite strains and the vendor that sold them and whatever else!

				I believe i saw some LA x Bubba Kush this morning.<br />I&#039;d love to try that.<br />But trying to define the best strain is like defining what type of medicine is needed if you cant describe your symptoms.<br /><br />The point is what are you looking for in your cannabis, because it is the most variable organism on the planet.<br />You want to get high to relax, to use medically, to have a deep thinking session or any number of reason you might consume cannabis.<br />You will get a better answer if you define what you are looking for in your cannabis.<br />Trying to be helpful but i feel I might come off dickish.<br />Start with Indica or Sativa dom and go from there.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

There are some things I&#039;d like to try but don&#039;t have the cred to buy, christynugs for example. And then there are all of those stealth listings we&#039;ll never know about.&nbsp; I love coming here and seeing 900 cannabis listings ~ freaking amazing, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />
