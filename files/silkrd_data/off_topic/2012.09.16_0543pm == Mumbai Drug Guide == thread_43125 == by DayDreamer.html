				Hello everyone.<br />I have noticed that there are a few people on the forums who might be interested in visiting Bombay sometime in the near future.<br />I thought I&#039;d post a small guide to drugs in Bombay for such people. This is mostly based on personal experience, and may not be applicable in all cases.<br />Any suggestions / corrections are welcome.<br /><br />BOMBAY DRUG GUIDE<br /><br />WEED<br />Weed is easily available. Not good quality compared to what i hear of purple haze, skunk and the likes.<br />Street Price : 4-7 USD /ounce or so in the city.There are many places outside the city where you get it at 1/3rd the price. This is for personal quantities. Bulk is even cheaper.<br />Sources : MANY small dealers scatterred all over the city, mostly in obscure slums. <br />While scoring weed, keep in mind that the dealers pay the LEOs a monthly bribe in return for permission to operate. your chances of getting caught in the vicinity of source are nearly 0, although not ruled out completely. always keep an eye out and be aware. Ignore the people staring at you. They know why you are there, they know what goes on where you&#039;re headed. They will not bother you. You are a paying customer, and they are poor people. And they want you to come back again.<br /><br />Consumption:<br />You have to be careful where you smoke. Smoking while driving through the city in a car is OK 99% of the time. You have to watch out for roadblocks, where they mostly check for DUI. They do so by sticking their head in the car to smell your breath, so if you have been smoking, they will smell the weed instead. Take appropriate safety measures / precautions, and you will be absolutely fine.<br />Smoking outdoors is very dependant on where you are, what time of day it is.. etc, but in general, LEOs are not specifically on the lookout for people smoking joints during the day.<br /><br />Outside the city and on national highways, no one gives a fuck. The only times you will have to be careful is while crossing the state borders, especially on the way to goa. <br /><br />What to do if busted :<br />In the city, you will have to wiggle your way out by paying a bribe. They will not put you in jail for smoking a joint, even if they threaten to, which they will at first. <br />In the end you will need to negotiate the amount to pay as bribe, but the subject needs to be brought up by YOU, not the cop, and not very directly. From experience, if caught with one joint, you will end up coughing up about 100&nbsp; USD equivalent in rupees in cash, if you are an Indian, and about thrice as much if you are a white foreigner. This is usually settled on the spot, however it is not uncommon to be asked to go to the police station to &quot;negotiate&quot;. Most police stations have no CCTVs. Lower level LEOs in bombay are underpaid. They WILL take bribes.<br /><br />HASHISH<br />Three varietes : bombay black,&nbsp; kashmiri , manali in order of their potency / desirability / price.Do not smoke bombay black. It&#039;s not worth it. Manali is available for betwenn 40 - 70 USD. the dealers operate by taking orders on their mobile phones. They will deliver to an area of your choice. Relatively safe. You can only get in touch with them through friends who already know them. Getting during consumption caught carries same risks as with weed and the same precautions apply.<br /><br /><br />COCAINE<br />Very easily available, considering the mumbai Police does not like the drug.<br />They assume that you have to be really rich to be doing charlie.<br /><br />Quality : highly variable, even from the same dealer and for the same price. The cheaper one is always cut.<br />Street Price : 50-130 USD/gram<br /><br />What to do if busted :<br />Option 1 - Do not get busted. Getting out of this will be difficult and very expensive. The best precaution is to keep your transaction with the dealer as short as possible, in a public place.<br />You will need to keep an eye out for police vehicles. Individual LEOs on foot will not be any trouble. <br /><br />Consume indoors only.<br />Scoring late at night ( when it is actually needed!) is very risky and i would not advise it. Pre planned purchases are safest.<br /><br />Option 2 - If you do get busted, follow the same procedure as with weed, but it will be much harder. Good luck.<br /><br /><br />MDMA<br />Quite easily available, good quality every single time i&#039;ve bought it.<br />The dealers of drugs such as MDMA, LSD, etc are usually well educated, well informed decent looking typical working class people.<br />The best way to deal with them is to meet up as buddies over a smoke, have a chat, assess the situation, then do the exchange, say thanks and be on your way.<br /><br />Do not carry MDMA into a club. Have it just before you go in. In fact make sure you have nothing illegal on you whenever you are inside a club.<br /><br />Street Price : 80-120 USD /gram<br /><br />LSD<br />Verly low availability in Mumbai. Very easily available in goa.<br /><br />Quality : Highly unpredictable. The strength is rarely known,even to the dealer, as the acid changes quite a few hands before it hits the street.<br />mostly available as blots.<br /><br />Street Price : 20-25 USD / blot. Very expensive imho.<br /><br />Remember - Keep the transactions with dealers as short as possible, in a public place,during usual hours, surrounded by people doing usual things. keep an eye out for brown coloured uniforms.<br />Consume in a safe place. within the city do not snort coke outdoors... very risky. go to a friend&#039;s place, or a hotel room.<br />MDMA is best consumed at a house party. LSD most effective outside the city, openair.<br /><br />Recently there has been a bust by a Police Commissioner named Vasnat Dhoble.&nbsp; I am unable to locate the original article about the raid itself, but you can read more about that pig here:<br />http://www.ndtv.com/article/people/who-is-vasant-dhoble-230923<br /><br />as of tonight, he has been transferred.<br />http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/moral-cop-dhoble-transferred/57196/<br /><br />This is good news for us people who like to do our drugs responsibly. He is off our backs for a while, till another Pig takes over...<br />

				I&#039;m not planning on visiting Bombay any time soon (although I am a sucker for some good curry/pakoras), but this is a very interesting post none the less.<br /><br />I would think opium and heroin would be fairly easy to score, given you know the right folks..&nbsp; And of decent quality as well.

				thanks a lot for this post, daydreamer ! Very informative. I&#039;m actually planning to go to india next year. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t bother buying LSD on the streets though, I&#039;d probably take it from my country, since it&#039;s so easily concealable. <br /><br />We should have more posts like this, something like a world guide to buying drugs on the streets !&nbsp; 8) <br />

				What about opium and heroin? :P As far as I know, opium is smoked in the same quantities as weed in India and there are a lot of poppy growers/refiners around :)

				Hello from india bro! Foreigners who come and smoke our weed will think its too spiked man, im from pune and i know all the weed you are talking about haha :D Also, if u get a chance try ordering some MD from on here. I have been to goa so many times, done coke(very little), acid( alot), md (little) and let me tell u the quality of everything is shit man. I have got good acid a few times yes, but those times have slowly become rarer and rarer. The MD we get is absolute crap man, the stuff you get here will really blow your mind. I havent tried the coke on here, too expensive. There are some really intense acid dealers on here, oh god i cannot tell you how much the first blots i got from here blew my mind man, but there stock goes quick, and if you want good rates you gotta buy bulk. Btw, have you got around buying bitcoins yet? There is an anonymous cash deposit method, but they charge 10% extra and i really wish there was some other ways to buy coins. Im coming down off some Nbome right now. So many drugs, so little time haha. Silk road is the shit
