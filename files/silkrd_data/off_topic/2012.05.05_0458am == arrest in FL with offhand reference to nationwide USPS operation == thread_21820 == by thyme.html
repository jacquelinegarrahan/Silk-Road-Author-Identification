				Did I miss mention on here or out in the clearnet world of a special &quot;nationwide operation?&quot; <br />I assume this is above and beyond the usual USPIS work. I can&#039;t find any other reference to such an operation. Also have not found reference to the other 13 arrests. Too many jurisdictions to easily tie things together. Nothing on regional press releases that was of interest.<br />Ocala Florida<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Local man charged during nationwide USPS operation<br /><br />One local man was arrested during a nationwide operation conducted April 16-25 by the U.S. Postal Service to intercept drugs, cash and guns going through the mail.<br />Local drug agents from the Multi-Agency Drug Enforcement Team, or MADET, assisted Orlando-area authorities during the operation. The officials seized 529 pounds of marijuana, 32 marijuana plants, 4.6 kilograms of cocaine, a kilogram of meth, .092 grams of heroin, 80 pills, $40,300 in cash and 13 firearms and made 14 arrests.<br />Sgt. Lee Whitston of the Ocala Police Department, a supervisor for MADET, said one of those arrested was Rolston Dowyne Anglin, 29, who was renting a residence in Silver Springs Shores.<br />Whitston said authorities recovered a pound of marijuana from a package that was sent to Anglin from California.<br />He said the U.S. Postal Service notified them about the parcel, which was believed to be suspicious in nature. Agents drafted a search warrant for the package, which was delivered to an address in the 8700 block of SE 88th Lane<br />...<br />.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				Moral of the story: DO NOT ship large amounts of a very smelly illegal drug.

				Notice the dates? Centered around 4/20. Maybe just a coincidence. Maybe he wasn&#039;t even related to SR. It sounds like they were just checking mail more than usual or something.

				Honestly if USPS had the manpower or care they could bust alot of drugs.<br /><br />355 days a year they dont so thats why everyone uses them ... numbers arent that surprising if you see how some people package shit.<br /><br />
