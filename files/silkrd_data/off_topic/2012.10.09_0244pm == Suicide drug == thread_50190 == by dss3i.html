				I would like to find out about a drug, which it is possible to commit a successful and pain free suicide with. The only drugs I am aware of to serve this purpose is barbiturates. For whatever drug you recommend, please also tell me the needed dosage, how overdosing the drug feels, and how it kills the body. <br /><br />(I am not planning a suicide. I am educating myself.)

The only drug I&#039;ve found with a good success rate is barbiturates. Alcohol isn&#039;t good because you might throw it up instead of dying, and at least in my opinion it makes you feel sick at such large doses.

				i actually agree, i think in many cases using a chemical would be a bad idea because theyres just too many variables unless youre actually having a barb administered during PAS... you run the risk of damaging organs but not dying because the body is surprisingly resilient <br /><br />but a bullet to the brain stem, now thats&nbsp; QUICK<br /><br />of course then you could be one of the (un)lucky ones who just blows half their head off but doesnt die somehow and is just permanently brain damaged

				I&#039;d go with the opiates. They seemed to work well for Dr Harrold Shipman (Britain&#039;s &#039;greatest&#039; serial killer, who murdered around 200(??) elderly patients). You would first enter that warm cosy state and then your breathing would rapidly become shallower and shallower, as you respiratory system shuts down. You wouldn&#039;t feel any panic or fear, you&#039;d just drift off into unconsciousness...<br /><br />A while back I did a little research into the US&#039;s use of lethal injection for capital punishment. I believe it to be unnecessarily cruel. If I were to get executed and had a choice, I&#039;d go for hanging or the guillotine.

Except for those brief periods when before your latest package from Silk Road runs empty. There are teachers who can help. Adyashanti has much to say but he is only one of many teachers.<br /><br />If the suffering person is dying from a painful disease, there is much information available about how to stop taking food, slowly at first, then when the person is tired and ready to pass, stop taking water. This is how the lucky animals do it. The ones not torn limb from limb by predators.<br /><br />My housemate&#039;s ancient cats and dogs crawl under under a cool porch and pass on while we are on vaction. Their food and water bowls are full but they lie down in the shade in a beautiful yard and pass.<br /><br />Not that being preyed upon is a total horror movie. I have heard of Zen masters whose sense of &quot;the sacredness and connectedness of all that is&quot; allowed them to offer their body to whatever predator or criminal might want it. It was of little consequence to them.<br /><br />***Important note. If you yourself are feeling suicidal do not try any psychedelics. Not LSD or MDMA or 2-CB or DMT or Baby Hawaiian Woodrose or anything. You won&#039;t die but you could visit one of the many hell regions that the Buddhists speak of. Been there. Done that. You might try it if you have a friend, counselor, or shaman to guide you. I&#039;ve heard they have Ibogaine clinics in Mexico and a woman in Romania who heals people with Ibogaine as her service to &quot;all that is&quot;, Great Spirit, God, what-have-you.<br /><br />&lt;/&gt;psychedelic Dr. Phil

I hope nobody will ever ask me to inject them with a shared needle. <br /><br />I&#039;m not recommending or helping anyone to commit suicide, even though I think it is everybody&#039;s right to do so and I know somebody who wants to, because this person who wants to is too young to make such a fatal choice in my opinion.

It&#039;s nice to digest even if you&#039;re not going to make use of it, just instead of belly fat it becomes brain stuffing. Besides, one day I might need my reserves. What if a asteroid hits the planet and I&#039;m the only surviving person? Then it would be too late to ask someone how to kill myself :)

				Hello people!<br /><br />Interesting how people react to this post. Appropriate answers and so on.<br /><br />I think i would either smoke heroin untill i pass, not sure if it works like that tho, (would i just fall asleep before smoking too much? never tried heroin, but prolly going to, soon (; ) or get high in speed and some opiates, then take my car, wouldn&#039;t wear my seatbelt and accelerate to top speed, or atleast 180 km/h (~115mph maybe) and then turn the car off the road to the woods and crashhhh big time. Most probably that crash would kill me. Crashing the car would be better to my friends, overdosing heroin or any other drugs and dying would be really hard to my friends and family, so the car crash would be better =P Still tho, with heroin it would be more pleasant to myself. If the smoking wouldn&#039;t work then i would try injecting.<br /><br />Suicide post made me join the forums and 1st post was about how to kill myself, should i be worried? ;P

No, the alcohol related deaths are all painfully slow, miserable deaths... not as bad as cancer, but not too far off in some cases. End stage liver disease were you&#039;re so full of fluid you legs literally weep fluid... liver function fails, blood passages returning to the liver overflow and create varicees (esophageal or bowel) so you vomit blood, shit blood, etc..... then you&#039;re so backed up with fluid (like CHF patients) the fluid kept in the legs, abdomen, etc begins to fill your lungs and literally drown in your own fluid..... or you turn yellow (jaundice) from liver failure which can even be seen in the whites (not yellow) of your eyes..... Oh and then there&#039;s the people who have been sober after being in very late stage liver failure (late stage is COMA... followed soon after by death) - - they get sober, fall off the wagon, go back into coma, we bring them back, they relapse, go into coma... eventually die. And of course there&#039;s always the one who starts drinking again while on oxycodone after their last drunk fall who spirals into liver failure but also has severe daily pancreatitus with causes 6-8/10 daily non stop pain, which in turn makes them want to drink more which causes even worse pain, vomiting, diarrhea...... Then there&#039;s the kidney failure in the late 30&#039;s early 40&#039;s on 3x a week dialysis (which means they&#039;ll be dead soon enough because no one who&#039;s a drunk gets a new kidney so they can destroy that one too)... and in the meantime they suffer all the shit that goes along with kidney failure. I can go on and on, I drink... but all in moderation... ya never know when all of a sudden you&#039;re doing it every day and your fucking stomach (yah, liver) hurts and you&#039;re too fucked up to stop.... alcohol&#039;s a real killer. I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s legal and weed isn&#039;t. The most problem I see with weed is when some asshole who doesn&#039;t smoke decides to eat a couple pot brownies and has a panic attack but swears he&#039;s dying, annoying as shit.<br /><br />I could go on for ages, sorry it&#039;s been a shit week at work watching people die over and over again.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and don&#039;t try to kill yourself, it&#039;ll probably not work and then you&#039;ll be in and out of the ER with liver failure wishing you hadn&#039;t tried it. And yeah, that benzo dosage seems like a party to some of the people I run across.<br /><br />The ones that survive the fall always wish they hadn&#039;t had jumped right after they step off. That being said, you&#039;d be surprised how far an INTACT brain can pop out of someone&#039;s head after a fall from a tall building. I thought it was a fluke after the first one I saw, then I realized that sucker doesn&#039;t splat at all - it cracks and pops!

				From what I&#039;ve been taught, most people who die from fire die because they inhale the super heated gasses from combustion, their airway seals and they die from asphyxiation. I assumed the monks held their breath and inhaled shortly before they die.<br /><br />They also tell us that 3rd degree burns do not hurt because the nerve endings have all been burned away. That sounds good in theory, but the people with full thickness burns seem like they&#039;re in agony... of course the 3rd degree burns I&#039;ve seen have been surrounded by 2nd degree burns so maybe that&#039;s why they hurt so bad (supposedly 2nd degree burns hurt the most... the burns with white raised blisters). If someone were to be completely involved in flame at once, it would make sense that all endings would be burned away fairly quickly and no pain felt. I dunno tho, I&#039;d say go to therapy.. or as much as people hate to hear it and it sucks balls... 5150 yourself at the local ER. That will suck some pretty hairy balls, but better than being dead.

If you&#039;re really ready, you&#039;ll push through the hunger and have some insights.

Of if you want, you can do that.<br /><br />None of this requires illegal drugs. Please don&#039;t put this forum at risk by requesting suicide drugs that are totally unnecessary. This is natures way.<br /><br />My guess is that is not your time to pass or you are law enforcement/entrapment trying to smear the life enhancing business that is going on here at Silk Road. If the former, my prayers go out to you. If the latter, see if you have some cousins, relatives someone, who can teach about plant medicine.

I always thought it was common knowledge that burning to death is one of, if not THE, most painful ways to die.<br /><br />To the OP:<br /><br />I saw a BBC documentary that seemed to imply that huffing N2 (Nitrogen) was the way to go out because not only is it quick and painless, but it&#039;s got the added benefit of total euphoria. Think of that nitrous oxide hit you&#039;ve taken, maybe at the dentist or rave, but without that binding oxygen compound you&#039;d fall unconscious even sooner and death would follow in minutes. Course you&#039;d want to ensure you&#039;re still breathing nitrogen after passing out, so an attached face mask or loosely secured garbage bag (loosely so the carbon dioxide you breathe out can escape) is a must. <br /><br />It&#039;d be easy to get a nitrogen tank too. Many times the welding shop or gas company will even deliver it if you find it&#039;s too heavy to transport yourself. In the unlikely event someone at the gas company asks say you need it for your air brush. <br /><br />I think if I&#039;m fortunate enough to live to a ripe old age where I get to choose by date and manner of death I&#039;d definitely go the N2 route. :)

				Take my 10 back of 15mg midazolam, you&#039;ll fall into a peaceful sleep, and never ever wake up. and honestly if your not afraid syringes. shooting up anything over 100mg of an opioid is risk for overdose which is a pretty peaceful death. but the easiest and most peaceful way is to swallow some midazolam (2nd strongest benzo) and some opana (2nd strongest opioid), and you will fall asleep and go into respiratory failure.<br /><br />

				An overdose is the riskiest method you could choose.&nbsp; Most overdose deaths show that the victim actually woke up in a frenzied delirious state vomiting and defecating all over them selves, struggling to crawl and get to a phone to call for help.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Ask for help.&nbsp; This sounds corny but it is true.&nbsp; Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

				There are some cases where I think suicide would be preferable. If I was looking at 25 years in prison then I would definitely want to kill myself or if I was suffering from unbearable physical pain that wouldn&#039;t go away.&nbsp; Just saying... a suicide pill might not be such a bad thing to keep handy in case shit really hits the fan.

				Dunno if already said, but I think taking a MAOi with an SSRI and MDMA, will take you very far away. You probably die from serotonin syndrome, which I think can be pretty painful. <br /><br />But the road to someones goal isn&#039;t always smooth.

Boring as fuck if you have no motivation to do anything but not that bad. You can go to the gym, learn things, educate yourself, read, meet some new interesting people. It really depends on how you act whilst your in, if your meek and walk in staring at the floor and stammering then you´re probably going to have a bad time. If you´re funny, confident, look people in the eye and hold your ground then you´ll be ok. It dosent matter if you lose a fight, what matters is that you had the bollocks to fight. You´ll get respect for that. Prison can serve as a good stop gap to bettering yourself, learning new things and positive change. you get a bed, food and unlimited learning for free. I can think of worse places/situations to be in on the out.

				For all those suggesting opiods,&nbsp; I saw a video of some guy convulsing from a heroin OD, he had gashed his head open from smacking it against the floor, his jaw was locked and foaming and I think he had bitten part of his tongue off and in his eyes he was aware of what was going on and shitting himself.... not pleasant. <br /><br /><br />Vets use phenobarbital for this purpose. [edit] sometimes I´d take a tiny bit to help sleep, this is peaceful and very quick however I think you would pass out before managing to get the whole thing in you´re arm so I think you would need to do an IV infusion with saline drip. <br /><br />One poster mentioned Nitrogen, in truth any inert gas will do, your body will be tricked into thinking it´s air so you wont have many of the unpleasant symptoms associated with asphyxiation, the result is brain death due to lack of oxygen in the brain, should take around 3 minutes if inhaling 100% of the chosen gas. sysmple setup, gas mask bottle of nitrogen or whatever and your good to go.. the poster that mentioned this before should bear in mind that this is not nitrous oxide, the stuff you use in ballons or dentists, it wont be giggly and fun. You´ll just feel yourself lose consciousness and never wake up. Currently the most favored method for the assisted suicide labs. Be careful though, if you are interrupted half way though you´ll be a vegetable with severe brain damage<br /><br />There are some cocktails you can make too, Anti Malaria tablets, I forget the name, are a very quick way to go but must be taken with an anti-emetic, the same with all cocktails really to prevent your body from throwing up. <br /><br />And then there&#039;s the phase that was going on in Japan where they mixed two chemicals together that produced a hydrogen sulphide gas which killed within 3 - 15 seconds of inhalation. Very easy to obtain. However it is painful, aborted attempts leave the person with blindness, also it is incredibly selfish, Rescue workers and neighbours are at risk, the gas is heavier than air and can killl people days after. <br /><br />I have spoken to a lot of people that have attempted it, and known a lot of people that were successful. The thing to remember is that it can´t rain forever. However shit your life seems now, one day you´ll look back and the dark times will just be a memory. And if you chose to kill youself you wont ever have a future great achievement, you wont hear another &quot;I love you&quot;, every smile you could have put on a persons face won´t have ever existed. times change and the world changes with it. What seems like a big deal now wont always be. Prison is not worse than death, I would chose it for the rest of my life rather than just give up. Because in there you are still living, still making people happy and being happy yourself, and you still have hope of being free. With death you have nothing and can´t go back. <br /><br />If this is just for research then cool, I believe in the free flow of information, If you are considering it all i would say is think carefully. some people with terminal illness chose to go out because all they have is a lot of pain before a certain death, I can understand this. I have difficulty understanding healthy people doing it. There is a future for all of us if we just chose to find it.
