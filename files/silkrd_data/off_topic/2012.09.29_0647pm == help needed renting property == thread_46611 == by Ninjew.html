				Hey Limit,<br />thanks for the reply<br /><br />i have no issues being specific , this cannot lead back to me from tor.<br /><br />its for cultivation.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been looking into this for a while. a guy i know did it a while back in a warehouse but in his own name .<br />went well but he told his landlord&nbsp; :-\ and ended up paying through the teeth to keep doing it there until it just wasn&#039;t doable anymore <br /><br />now im looking for some way in england to get discreet space for it.

You have to make sure the owner is afraid of what happens if he fucks with you, make it come across like he needs you rather than the reverse.

				HA<br /><br />i like the last idea simply on balls factor&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />@limit :<br />a lot of complications arise that way. although we have the ability to threaten / extort a landlord it&#039;s a logistical nightmare keeping someone intimidated , especially since we need repeated grows, plus it aint fair if the poor cunts innocent in the first place.<br /><br />i know this can be done without the landlord being brought in on it.<br /><br />

				I know a dude who has been growing in a rented warehouse since 1977.<br /><br />he rented it out with some stolen ID and still to this day has the spot, and puts out some sick M39 from there..<br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d try the fake ID route...You can even open a business with no ID (where I&#039;m from) So in essence Joe Blow can open a company just not the bank account and then you have company papers when you go see the landlord<br /><br />Good luck on your grow!<br /><br />

				You have to ask yourself whether you would want to cultivate in a property that someone is willing to rent out for cash in hand. The only types of property that people are going to rent out for cash in hand are going to be in areas that are utterly unsuitable for cultivation e.g. crime hot spots and sink estates. Shady cash in hand property rental is not really the sort of thing a mundane middle class suburban property owner would do.

Now, this is a massive undertaking of course and with the economic crisis, a considerable deposit may be required. Choosing who to have buy the house is difficult and the primary issue is trust, but generally you should also account for their age and financial standing (to get good mortgage deals) and their current relation web so their wife/girlfriend/mum/dad/son/daughter/whatever doesn&#039;t go snooping on their behalf either. Preferably they should also have a criminal record free past too.<br /><br />Once the house is bought, have the person rent it to you on say a 24 month contract and the agreement is made on a contract like any other house rental. Make sure to include itineraries, method of payment (Yes, using cash and then having the house owner return a receipt is perfectly acceptable and should be done at a location other than the house being rented so that if busted in future, the house owner can&#039;t be asked why he didn&#039;t know of the plants when receiving payment - a good excuse for them is to say the payment was made inside his own permanent address and not the rental house) etc. You may even want to draft in a lawyer to double check the contract for you as with any legal matter, this may also add credibility so the house owner can&#039;t have the house seized as the proceeds of crime if they&#039;re believe to have assisted in the grow operation.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A friend of mine uses a similar approach. However, in what I feel is a much less secure move, instead of using a friend/acquaintance, he himself purchases the house, setting up the bogus rental records.&nbsp; He also does the cultivation, half ass at that I may add. His only real requirement is an attached garage for incognito entry to the house, other than that, many location can work.

				I may know of a way of renting a property almost if not totally anonymously. Most areas near Universities in the U.K have properties ranging from studio flats to 7 bed houses which can be rented through deposits straight into landlord&#039;s bank account. As properties are generally rented per bedroom you might need to get a friend to be a &#039;fake tenant&#039; i.e sign a contract under a fake name and make up a phony guarantor. Ideally find one who lives far away who won&#039;t pop round to check the condition of the house, also one that doesn&#039;t have planned maintenance work done i.e boiler repairs. This way you won&#039;t need a large deposit on a house but you would need a months deposit per room, no fake id, company registration etc. Just don&#039;t go through estate agencies obviously, you can find a lot of properties on gumtree, property websites and university affiliated websites. Hope I helped.

				There are plenty of fuckers on craigslist who hardly even ask for ID (mine didn&#039;t). Pay your rent on time every month, be friendly, ...? This is the case midwest usa, I don&#039;t know bout you coast fellas though. I think this is most do-able in semi-shitty parts of town, as the landlords are just happy to not have some drunk ass people trashing the house and not paying on time.

				I am going to make a suggestion, and I am sure some one will explain why it wont work. I dont grow weed anymore and when I did, I had a great place to grow it.<br /><br />Set up a trust, and a management company that is owned by the trust to manage property. Then pick up a lot in a smaller town, many go for under 2k and put a trailer home on the property. At least around here you can get a used trailer home for under 10k and if you look you can get them for free.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
