				Well I only smoke weed and I don&#039;t really consider that drugs but it makes sex feel different for me in a nice way, also makes me a lot more horny ;) <br /><br />I rarely drink alcohol or get drunk but if I&#039;m drunk I can&#039;t have an orgasm so that&#039;s pretty bad.

				Wow.<br /><br />viagra - notoriously difficult to cum on<br />molly - even more difficult to cum on<br /><br />The two together, absolutely no fucking way.<br /><br />Somebody suggested GHB following an MDMA roll. Definitely the way to go. There&#039;s definitely an element of sexuality in an MDMA come down that makes you just want to fuck like nasty pigs, even though you just CANNOT FUCKING ORGASM to save your life, but GHB seems to add an entirely different element to it. Much more relaxed, sexual and naughty.<br /><br />I&#039;d say MDMAfollowed by GHB for the comedown.<br /><br />NOT METH. Good luck achieving an orgasm within 48 hours hahaha
