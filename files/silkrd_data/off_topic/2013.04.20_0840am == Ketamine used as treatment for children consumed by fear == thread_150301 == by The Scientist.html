				This doesn&#039;t surprise me; the few times I&#039;ve tried ketamine, I noticed that it completely eliminated by mortal sense of fear. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(...)<br /><br />Papolos thought it just might help the fearful children he was studying. He had a particular child in mind: a 7-year-old girl who had severe nightmares, night terrors, separation anxiety and psychotic symptoms. And, by chance, this little girl was scheduled for a dental procedure that can be done using an inhaled form of ketamine as the anesthetic.<br /><br />&quot;She got ketamine, and for two weeks she was completely asymptomatic,&quot; Papolos says. &quot;We had never seen anything like it before.&quot; That was five years ago. Today, the girl is still taking ketamine and is still free of symptoms, Papolos says.<br /><br />After a number of , Papolos discussed the drug with George and Cydney McCann. By this time, George was in high school and his moods were less extreme. But fear still dominated his life. He was terrified by subway rides. He was too frightened to drive a car.<br /><br />But in 2010, George did try Papolos&#039; ketamine treatment. He says he&#039;ll remember the day for the rest of his life. &quot;I think we did two puffs, and I remember I sat up and I just started laughing,&quot; he says. Then his mother picks up the story: &quot;You said you had an internal feeling of calm that you had never had before in your life. And when we came home that night, that was the first night that we ever all had dinner at the table without somebody leaving.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s a surprising and provocative result. But the research is still in its very early stages. The number of patients treated so far is small, and the approach is so new it hasn&#039;t been tested by other researchers yet. Papolos says he&#039;s hoping a will help persuade other researchers to try the drug on other children.<br /><br />In the meantime, George McCann continues to inhale a prescribed dose of ketamine every third day. The fear and anger that once dominated his life are gone, he says, adding that his mind is free now to work on that movie script about redemption.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/03/25/174928768/how-an-unlikely-drug-helps-some-children-consumed-by-fear

				wtf giving children illegal drugs !!!! We must put an end to this, better for them to live in fear for their entire lives than to try an illegal drug even once.

				From what I understand, Ketamine used to be a really common anesthetic and painkiller for kids back in the day. Just a big shot in the butt for all sorts of ailments.
