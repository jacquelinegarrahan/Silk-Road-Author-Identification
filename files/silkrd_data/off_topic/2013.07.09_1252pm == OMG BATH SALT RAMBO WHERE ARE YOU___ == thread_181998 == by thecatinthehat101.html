				Omg why didn&#039;t I know about this guy his threads are off the hook but I love it. I want to be recruited and trained by by the best is he still around??<br /><br />Bath Salts Rambo your def hard core but ya know what I love it. Train me! *Salutes Reporting for duty as ordered sir!<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Why do you keep deleting your account and starting over?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t delete your former posts ... just so you know ...&quot;<br /><br />Response:<br />&quot;Soldier we all need to change our garments at some point. We all need to change our robes and roles. I have my reasons. When Jesus was nailed to the cross for all our sins, they asked him the same thing, what will you do now you scoundrel from Nazareth. And you know what he did? He &quot;STARTED OVER&quot;.&quot;<br /><br />STARTED OVER. He came back. I have also started over. A resurrection of sorts.<br /><br /><br />Jack N Hoff I literally pissed myself when people were asking why he kept deleting his account and you threw in <br /><br />&quot;They&quot; asked Jesus why he keeps deleting his forum account and making a new one?&quot;<br /><br />Bravo Sir :)
