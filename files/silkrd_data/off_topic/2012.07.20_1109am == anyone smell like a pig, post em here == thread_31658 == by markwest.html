				I really don&#039;t think a witch hunt is a good idea. But I&#039;m probably just saying that because I&#039;m secretly a cop. <br /><br /><br /><br />That was probably reverse psychology to make you think I&#039;m not a cop.<br /><br /><br /><br />So was that.<br /><br /><br />And that.

				I read some of his posts, and there&#039;s no way of knowing for sure whether or not he is LEO.&nbsp; Of course, you could say the same of just about everyone here.&nbsp; So I&#039;d advise you treat &quot;bobyouruncle&quot; like everyone else here. Don&#039;t share personal information with him or post incriminating information that might link you to an ongoing investigation.&nbsp; (I.e. don&#039;t brag about that pharmacy heist you pulled off with your buddies).&nbsp; And whether or not bobyouruncle is a cop, you can rest assured that there are law enforcement professionals reading this site.&nbsp; Keep that in mind every time you post.
