				I&#039;m excited because I&#039;m probably going to try 25i-nbome tonight.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read most of what the internet has to offer about the substance, I think.<br /><br />I was plotting a mg sublingually with one of duderugs&#039; tabs, which just arrived today.<br /><br />Will probably check this thread before I do it. Anyone got any input for me before I try this new drug?<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you guys know how it goes.

				I had the felix&#039;s from dudes at 1mg each tab.<br /><br />I found that 1 was just the edge of really enjoying the 25i, so last time I consumed I had one in my mouth for about 45 minutes, then took it out and waited about 30 minutes then put another in.<br /><br />WOAH<br /><br />This is how it should be done, IMO. :P<br /><br />With 1 its like being on a very small dose of shrooms with a little euphoria, and you vision gets blurred a little.<br /><br />If you are experienced with psychedelics give two a shot.

				To begin with, 1mg is perfect for just having a great night. I prefer 2mg, and never really go any further than that anymore because anything higher gives me the worst muscle tension. But yeah, 6mg got me to an intense +++, I&#039;d even go so far as to say a moderate ++++ trip.<br /><br />If you want to have a blast take the tab and go on a bike ride in the park or on a trail! If you&#039;re into longboarding, that&#039;s even better! 25i-NBOMe really stands out in the outdoors at night with some friends or in a dark room alone pondering the universe. I&#039;ve even driven to the movies on 25i and my god was it fun or what?! ;D

				Now I&#039;m torn as to whether I wanna take one or two...<br /><br />I&#039;ve tripped enough time to consider myself experienced, and I usually prefer to take 2-3 hits of acid (when we&#039;re talking 100ug-ish), but on the other hand this is a brand new drug to me... hmm...<br /><br />Gary, I may just go for a walk tonight because you said that.<br /><br />

Because I always feel numb exactly where I left the tab usually 30 minutes after placing it. It&#039;s not until around the 90 minute mark that I notice that I&#039;m subtly tripping, so post an update in 30 minutes letting us know how you&#039;re doing. I&#039;m pretty sure 25i isn&#039;t orally active so you can spit the tab out or chew it up a bit and swallow it, either way it doesn&#039;t really matter. I&#039;ve been led to believe you need to hold your saliva the entirety it&#039;s in your mouth though, so wait until you&#039;re done with the tab to smoke or drink anything even though it might leave a bitter taste in your mouth.

				between my upper lip and gum, per duderugs&#039; instructions. off to the right side a little. not really feeling a &quot;numb&quot; feeling. one every ten minutes i&#039;ve been thinking maybe I feel something, but nothing has truly set in ball tripping style yet.<br /><br />[+hours:minutes]<br /><br />[+0:00]: dosed one hit 1mg between my upper lip and gum. have been consuming <br /><br />cannabis, in accordance with my day to day policy on that drug (which is to be <br /><br />high as often as possible).<br /><br />[+0:12]: I taste the chemical. Not very pleasant. Metallic, as others have <br /><br />described it. Wondering if I&#039;m allowed to take a drink something or not, have <br /><br />been trying not to spit. Hoping I didn&#039;t ruin it by smoking some weed (I forgot I <br /><br />had the tab in my gum). I think I&#039;m starting to feel something too but it could <br /><br />just be placebo.<br /><br />[+0:33] felt a distinct chill up my spine. but different from normal spine chills. it was more like a mini buzz wave. I really liked it. tasted a second wave of nasty chemical taste too. smoked a cig (tab still in mouth).<br /><br />[+1:00] Still not feeling a whole lot. thinking here in about another hour if nothing then I&#039;m going to maybe try rinsing my mouth out with listerine (a tip I read but spaced out on), then taking a tab and not smoking or drinking (I broke down and took a sip of dew) or anything.<br /><br />[+1:09] I think I feel the numb spot you were talking about. Just realized that alcohol is in listerine.... so... that would actually be a dumb idea...

				I love 25i so much, i am waiting on an order from Duderugs right now. I really hope it come to me fast.. 25i is now my second favorite drug, LSD come first but i have to do high doses to get a decent trip (like 300-450ug) and because of the price i prefer to do 25i more often. I keep LSD for special occasions now&nbsp; 8)

Taking a quick break to eat and smoke then ill give this a shot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s so sad, my first time was magical. :&#039;( But I didn&#039;t swallow my first time, did you? ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol. I didn&#039;t mean to but did. I sorta ended up eating a chicken sandwich. Anyway I think I feel something now. Definitely a distinct feeling from lsd, but if I had to compare it to an lsd dose id say maybe 60ug. <br />I think I&#039;m about to add another tab.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s weird how substances can work so differently for others. For instance, I hardly get visuals from shrooms and believe me I&#039;ve had them in all shapes and sizes. All they really do is make me feel like a kid again and gives me a nostalgic head-space.

Literally there were parts about that night that I had no clue how the fuck I got where I was. All I remember is laughing my fucking ass off and getting scared to death at the same time by this Krispy Kreme manager at the drive-thru....which is apparently where we decided on going while tripping balls. We had a sober driver that time, but everyone else in the car was completely blitzed out of their minds. From what I can recall, the manager asked if someone farted in the car or something because we were laughing hysterically and blasting techno louder than normal. Freaking git.

				Autopilot eh?<br /><br />Not sure I&#039;m experiencing any of that. I&#039;m not sure how to describe what I&#039;m feeling so far. Nothing like acid. No visuals yet. Some moments I feel higher than others. I feel it in my head and arms right now.

				When you&#039;re trying a new drug, ever look at the light bulb, then look away, and wonder if the resulting pattern is a hallucination, even though you know what it is, and at one time, could probably even give the scientific expllanation for it, before you burned yourself out?

				bro i had my first nbome experience with duderugs product, the white tabs?..had 1 then 2... didnt get visuals... ended up having 5-7 i dont really remember but i had a full blown psychedelic experience, walls breathing, faces melting &quot;enlightenment&quot; and umm...thai buddas reaching out to me and the most calm and relaxed i have ever been!.....4 hours later that was followed by 20 mins oh...shit my heart is going to stop and im about to die. That last bit may be due to later alcohol and benzos but the point is you have to do a few tabs and it pays off :)

				You should try 25c. I&#039;ve done experimentation at several doses on 25i and found c much more impressive. Looking forward to eating 1200 micrograms today.

				I&#039;d like to try insufflating 25c. I hear the come up is only minutes. It&#039;s already very quick when administered buccally. I&#039;ve never taken a psychedelic (besides DMT obviously) that rockets you directly into the trip.

				yea snorting it has a faster come up about 20 to 25 minutes but that come up is harsher then the blotters in my opinion. I have given out 25i and 25 c both caps and tabs. People like the 25c better in my area
