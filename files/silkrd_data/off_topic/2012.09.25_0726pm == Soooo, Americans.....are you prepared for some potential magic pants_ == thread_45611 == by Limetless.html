				So Americans, how do you guys feel about having Norman the Mormon running for president and do people in the U.S actually take this guy seriously? He was on the news today and I can&#039;t get my head around how probably a medium sized margin of America and in particular, the Republican Party, thought this guy was a good idea to have this guy as their front man. I mean the guy straps dogs to the top of cars! That&#039;s not a good precedent for running the most powerful country in the world. As America treats the U.K like it&#039;s dog does that mean you be strapping us atop an SUV? If so please stop, take a step back and don&#039;t do this! We don&#039;t want any extra breeze in our faces!<br /><br />On the level though what do people think of this guy? I&#039;m not particularly pro-Obama here either so this isn&#039;t coming from that perspective. I just find Norman the Mormon quite hard to get my head round and as you guys live with him I&#039;m interested to here what you think. <br /><br />I personally think you need Boris to run your country and I do believe we would be happy to rent him out to you so long as we can have him back once we get rid of Dave because we will need him then. <br /><br />Discuss.

				Romney will be the 3rd term of the George W Bush administration with Wall Street replacing the oil industry as the pimp whoring out the rest of the country (not that it isn&#039;t happening already).<br /><br />As bad as Obama if Romney wins I might move to a place with a much better human rights and democratic track record, like say Iran.

				Romney and Obama are the same person, as far as I&#039;m concerned. We won&#039;t make anymore progress until we put an Independent in the White House. That&#039;s why I&#039;m voting for Johnson. Even though he doesn&#039;t have a chance at winning, each vote gives him credibility for 2016.

				It seems as if idiocy is a prerequisite for Republican nomination. McCain seemed like a decent guy but George W and Romney ? SURELY they don&#039;t represent the cream of the conservative crop. Fuck me....<br /><br />Having said that, I used to enjoy watching all those documentaries about what a tit George W was. It&#039;s been a bit boring since you&#039;ve had Obama in power as he&#039;s a very capable politician, speaker and statesman, but get Romney back in and we&#039;re back in business......

He was on the news today and I can&#039;t get my head around how probably a medium sized margin of America and in particular, the Republican Party, thought this guy was a good idea to have this guy as their front man. I mean the guy straps dogs to the top of cars! That&#039;s not a good precedent for running the most powerful country in the world. As America treats the U.K like it&#039;s dog does that mean you be strapping us atop an SUV? If so please stop, take a step back and don&#039;t do this! We don&#039;t want any extra breeze in our faces!<br /><br />On the level though what do people think of this guy? I&#039;m not particularly pro-Obama here either so this isn&#039;t coming from that perspective. I just find Norman the Mormon quite hard to get my head round and as you guys live with him I&#039;m interested to here what you think. <br /><br />I personally think you need Boris to run your country and I do believe we would be happy to rent him out to you so long as we can have him back once we get rid of Dave because we will need him then. <br /><br />Discuss.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why do others feel the need to denigrate others for their religious beliefs?<br />I can only laugh when i read shit like this. I am glad i don&#039;t own a TV and now i am once <br />again justified in not having one. People have lost their ability to think for themselves and<br />i am not necessarily speaking of limmy just because i quoted him. U guys just don&#039;t get it!<br />it doesn&#039;t matter what suit is in office - they r both the same!! well sort of. Obama is a full fledged communist<br />and Romney is just a dupe for the republican elitists to see if a Mormon can finally win the presidency.<br />It really won&#039;t matter which one wins the outcome will be the same just like it is now and has been in the <br />past!!! The banks and corporations will run the country! Us the citizens will merely remain the same slaves <br />that we have always been since 1913 when the federal reserve was enacted illegally. We - the American<br />citizens pay interest to a private bank called the federal reserve and the major corporations<br />bribe our senators and congressmen to carry their water.&nbsp; The federal reserve is as federal as federal express!! Not - look it up...<br />So u see limmy - as long as the sheep here vote for one of the two parties it really won&#039;t matter what one wins!!<br /><br />I think Romney is a nice guy - he gave 30% of his income to charities last year and the years before that - Mormon and all!<br />Do u really believe that no blacks were helped by that money?<br />The unfortunate thing is that no matter how good or evil a man is when he reaches the presidency he will bend to the will of the <br />bankers and corporations unless he has the intestinal fortitude to seize their assets and property and execute all of them first. <br /><br />That being said i will never vote for Romney or Obama because they are both corporate and banker tools.<br />If u guys like Obama so much - r we out of Afghanistan? Iraq is gitmo closed? is weed legal? NO! Obama has <br />shut down more clubs in Cali than any other president - even Bush!!!<br />I am a political atheist and i believe they r all the same. we should be in control of ourselves!<br />

They oppose racism, sexism, and sexual-preference bigotry, whether perpetrated by private individuals or (especially) by government. They reject racial discrimination, whether in its ugly traditional forms or in its newer guises as Affirmative Action quotas and &quot;diversity&quot; rules.<br /><br />Libertarians recognize that there will always be bigotry and hatred in the world, just as there will always be fear and stupidity; but one cannot use laws to force understanding any more than one can use laws to force courage or intelligence.&nbsp; I think you would find that oppression and persecution of minority groups would go down.<br />

				The problem is that you can&#039;t reduce the size and scope of government without reducing the size and scope of the multi-national corps.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying this from the perspective that the state needs to dictate business details but rather because so many of the corporations are states unto themselves.&nbsp; If the ability to tax without recourse and stand an army is the mark of a state then Goldman Sachs (and JP Morgan, BOA, etc) are states.&nbsp; Their tax power comes via the Federal Reserve in their ability to confiscate wealth through the debasement of our currency.&nbsp; Blackwater and similar security firms provide them with as large of an army as they can afford.
