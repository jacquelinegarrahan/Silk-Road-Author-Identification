				I got pulled over leaving my dealers house and the police found an 8th of weed on me and were going to arrest me but I was like LOL I DIDN&#039;T SIGN FOR THAT so they let me go. Last week I was going through customs and they found an 8th of weed on me but were all like lol personal use so they just shook their finger at me and let me on my way. <br /><br />Discuss.

				There have probably been a 1000 posts on SR dedicated to the fantasy that buyers can ward off prosecution by just refusing to sign when their purchase arrives in the mail.&nbsp; &quot;Just refuse to sign, dude, and the pigs can&#039;t do nothin&#039; to ya!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m glad to see that we&#039;re finally getting over this kind of magical thinking.&nbsp;

				but an unopened letter with no link to a purchase history or payment is going to be very hard to prove possesion?<br /><br />wouldn&#039;t it?<br /><br />

				unless you happen to have that letter in your car/pocket when you get pulled over. sure you might not have opened it, but you are still in possession of it.

				and if the letter has a fake name on it, they might also be able to add mail fraud to your charges.
