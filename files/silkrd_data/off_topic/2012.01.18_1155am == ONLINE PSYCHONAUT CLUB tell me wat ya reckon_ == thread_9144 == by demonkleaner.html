				Pretty good idea, wouldn&#039;t be that hard to code, but then again stuff like torchat already exists<br />and if you want audio or video thats a security risk, and there is clearnet stuff for that anyway.<br />Or are you thinking of something like erowid with a chatroom?<br /><br />If you want to pursue it further i would be willing to code if I was compensated.<br />
