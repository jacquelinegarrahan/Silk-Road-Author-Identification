				in terms of ease of use, really consider TAILS 0.14. <br /><br />SR down since Friday? *puts on conspiracy hat*<br /><br />NO site...and I mean NO SITE would ever have such a lengthy period of downtime voluntarily. SR has indubitably been compromised. I wouldn&#039;t worry about your personal security as much as your BTC / orders going astray, but I dont buy that it is planned maintenance at all. Give me a fucking break. <br /><br />If it IS, these guys are scary little amateurs and that should be enough of a warning signal imo<br /><br />SR is a simple (undoubtedly) SQL transaction layer system, let&#039;s face it. Maybe MongoDB/NoSQL if they are hot coders (anything is possible). It just runs on TOR to make it seem more secure to people. I got all my PGPs secure. fuck it, if SR goes down we can get the source code and host it ourselves.

				@gonzo - i wasnt talking about database corruption.&nbsp; I was talking about a poorly created database from the begininng..&nbsp; lots of redudencies. storing blobs, ect ect. I dont think its the case here, it was just an example, but if&nbsp; you create a site, with a poor designed DB that can be the bottleneck.. it&#039;ll work fine, until you start getting a couple hundred thousand transactions then it&#039;ll just fall over.

(iI like to browse...)<br /><br />*censored...jsut realised forum post! der* However, due to the sports I do, the typical PEDs are garbage . long story short, if you want to keep it simple; 8 weeks of sus 250 shots (1ml per week) . If you need more than that, you aren&#039;t training hard enough. All depends on your goals though. Muscle mass to me is a waste of weight/time. totally counterproductive. strength to me is heart stroke weight as much as my total 1RM% .No point getting massive, uncoordinated limbs. <br /><br />The essence of strength training is diet and consistency. Anabolics just enable consistent hard training. Do 8 weeks of powerlifting on roids. If you dont gain 10 kg of mass (largely fluid). I dunno, start ballet (kidding, if you fail at powerlifting, you will definitely fail at ballet . :) <br /><br />*censored* fuck SR message limits. If you are having difficulty gaining mass or meeting training goals, i&#039;ll take the pepsi challenge on any ashhole currently consulting you lot (essentially, without giving much away, this is my career)

				lol. just saw older post now GUS. hahahaha. Nah man, I am married(I know... &#039;but how &#039; they ask?!?!) . I just like to make wild allegations/statements.

GO harness your body weight in weights and go hang off a fat grip bar or some climbing pieces for max time.&nbsp; It is just your grip, but watch your totals rise !<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So true, my hands and forearms always give out first, at least when trying to maintain good form.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />for sure. Like any filthy Kraut, I grew up sport climbing . It was all I had to explain why my lift totals were more than other similarly built mates as a teen. Then when I started studying I realised how important that signal from your grip to your brain is&nbsp; to produce maximum muscle tensions. prone hangs, one hand hangs, fist hangs , toe hangs (all with additional weight to reduce hang time required for solid time-under-tension).<br /><br />If I were to hit a cycle up, I would spend 12 weeks on my grip and lower back and neck. get mass to those cunt of all body parts and reap the benefits for the rest of your life probably.

				To Gonzo &amp; Any1 who wnats to join IRC for our chat. (I thought i posed this yesterday but obviously it dindt work)<br /><br />First of all you need an IRC Client. Pidgen is a good one. Download it (you can get it in Windows or linux)<br />in pidgen u need to goto :<br />Accounts -Manage Accounts - ADD<br />Protocol - IRC<br />Username - Your nick<br />Server: silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion<br /><br />Then goto - Proxy and setup:<br />Proxy Type - Socks 5 <br />Host - 127.0.0.1<br />PORT : 9050<br /><br />Then your done! Save it should connect<br />if it doesnt connect then you may have the wrong port, you just need to goto the TOR Mesage Log and look for this line:<br /><br />Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^^^^ this is your port number, it should be 9050<br />
