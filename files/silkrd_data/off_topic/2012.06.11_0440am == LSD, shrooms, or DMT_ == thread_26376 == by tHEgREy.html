				Ok, this may be silly, but I want to know your opinions on what I should order this time around. I have tried all three; shrooms once, dmt breakthrough once, and lsd a bunch of times. If I order dmt it would be pharmayahuasca as I haven&#039;t tried that yet. If I order shrooms, it&#039;s because of USAShrooms delicious chocolate bars and the spiritual (ego ending) experience I had. If I choose Lucy, it&#039;s because I&#039;m familiar and I want to push my limits i.e. take more than 300mics.<br /><br />I wish I could buy all three but that&#039;s the predicament. I want to keep suspicious mail to a minimum due to moving in with the &#039;rents. <br /><br />P.S. I&#039;m not the stereotypical 30y/o living in his mothers basement in case you were wondering.

				eenie meenie miney moe...<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest either the pharmayahuasca or the chocolate shrooms, seeing as I have both of these on my list of things to buy.<br /><br />Personally, I am extremely excited for my future ayahuasca journey.<br /><br />sdesu

				The chocolate shrooms are amazing! I dunno how he/she does it but they taste wonderful, and the come up, although unexpected, wasn&#039;t terrifying and I didn&#039;t have that &quot;bad&quot; part of the trip that I read about.<br /><br />I&#039;m saving my bitcoin for a rather large pharma purchase because I want friends to experience it too. I keep telling my drug buddies &quot;DMT is SO FUCKING AWESOME!! It&#039;ll blow your mind, piece it together, and blow it again. If you want to meet Jesus or an alien then look no further.&quot; Lol I&#039;m such a bad influence.

				Shrooms are my personal favorite and I highly recommend them but they are certainty not as strong as some good old Lucy so if you are familiar with Lucy then I would say DMT is the way to go if your ready to have your reality blown. And the fact that you have had one breakthrough DMT experience means your still have plenty of potential for a good spiritual (or just entertaining if your not spiritually inclined) experience. But in the end its up too you, since you have done all three you know the different levels of intensity that all three wonderful substances have. Be safe and enjoy :)
