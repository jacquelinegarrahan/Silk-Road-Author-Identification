				I was once hooked on hydrocodone and was also curious about H but never tried it. I have a lot of respect for the power of opiates and its accompanying addictiveness and worse, its withdrawals. So, I&#039;m just giving H a try and then cutting it loose. I did the same thing recently with crystal meth. Gave it a try and then put it away.

				I&#039;ve thought the same as you, I think it depends on how mature you are and are able try it once and that&#039;s it. Also when you try, make sure you&#039;re with somebody.<br /><br />Maybe some of the h users could give their point of view

				First off, as a daily user for years now... if you are not already using opiates it is really best just consider them outside the realm of SAFE recreational use. They are the most intensely addictive substances and I have tried basically all classes of addictive chemicals. If you are going to use opiates, DO NOT IV them. <br /><br />That being said, unless you IV the heroin, it is remarkably similar to the prescription opiates except it has a shorter half-life so it doesnt last as long. I know from experience honestly. I actually never had access to H until SR... so I obviously acquired some and was incredibly excited just to try it. Well, talk about disappointing! Each bag had waaayyy less in it than I expected, and the powder was NO where near as strong as I expected it to be, and this was from the most reputable vendor on SR. It was incredibly overpriced and this is from someone who pays 1 dollar per mg of oxy... The problem with H is that there is no quality control and you can never be sure of what you are going to receive even if you do get your order, or how much of it you will need to achieve desired effects without taking that long dirt nap. <br /><br />In my opinion, and the opinion of the H vendor who recommend this to me, is that you should stick to the pharms if you are interested in opiates. The benefit is you know exactly what you are paying for, and that the dose is regulated so you know how much you need to get where you want to be... The reason some people would chose H over pharms is because it is generally much cheaper, but not here on SR with the current reliable vendors.<br /><br />Basically, there will be minor subjective differences but it is not worth the risk for H. Morphine can provide the same relaxed type of high that H provides (as H is metabolized into morphine) but you will not achieve the same intensity of the rush because it cannot cross the blood brain barrier as quickly as H. Oxy is slightly more stimulating than morphine, but both provide a decent amount of euphoria. IF you are really wanting to know what H is like, then oxymorphone (snorted, as oral bioavailability is only 10%) will give you a really good idea. Oxymorphone is one of the most potent opiates I have ever tried, and in my opinion is completely superior to street H (the only thing I would choose over it is pharma grade diamorphine, aka H, since it is so rare). Just be incredibly careful with oxymorphone as it is VERY easy to overdose on; an opiate intolerant person probably could feel 1-2 mg and should not attempt to take more than 5 mg to be safe. Also, absolutely NO ALCOHOL, which can cause overdose, and avoid re-dosing quickly because it can take around 30+ minutes to kick in completely.<br /><br />Just so you are aware, MDMA is in no way comparable to heroin, except for feeling content even if you really shouldnt be. <br />Always remember to motto with opiates. You can always take more, but you can never go back and take less. Have fun but Stay safe!

				I&#039;ve smoked H a handful of times, and my friend (I have no idea where he is now, btw) convinced me to IV it. That was it for me. The intensity of the rush was like being shot out of a cannon into the strats and then floating back down to earth on a cloud of titties.<br /><br />I really questioned what the fuck I was doing after that and haven&#039;t used any opiates since. Well, I take that back, I had a script for 15 10/500 perc&#039;s when I had oral surgery a couple years ago .. but I ended up throwing some of them away once I didn&#039;t need them.<br /><br />I know some people aren&#039;t so able to walk away from addictive substances - if you&#039;re one of those people I would highly suggest you NOT try H.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You should do some research, opiates are one of if not the most addictive substances your body can get. Read some research papers, understand the physiology of it and I dont think you will ever want to do it.&nbsp; I was in a drug dependency research lab during my undergrad and we studied cocaine and opiates in rats and in a lot of the animal studies you will have dependance after one administration. The scariest part of this drug is that you do not become addicted but you become dependent. Your brain stops producing chemicals like endorphins and natural opiates when you use. It is not something like cocaine where you can just stop. You have to have the drug. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dont believe its one of those drugs that you can say you will only do once until you do it. The rush and the way it makes you feel is something you can not prepare for.&nbsp; I cant imagine the cravings, as I have never done it. I dabbled in cocaine for a short period and that was enough for me on the addictive substances list. But with all drugs if you do decide to do it, be safe and understand the drug and the potential issues that revolve around it. I for one am terrified of this drug not because it is bad but because it is so good.

One of my friends is in jail for a few years and another threatened to kill me for 100 bucks, but we&#039;re cool now. On the other hand, I personally feel a far stronger compulsion for weed and other substances than I do for heroin. If I were to never do it again, I wouldn&#039;t consider it a big loss.<br /><br />I would recommend holding off for now, and deciding later. Maybe try taking a percocet first and decide after that?

				I decided a few years back to experiment a little.<br />I grew my own poppies and harvested raw opium, which I would smoke in joints with some MJ.<br />VERY floaty, and relaxing.&nbsp; I literally poured myself into a chair and didn&#039;t move for a long while after my first time.<br />I figured, I didn&#039;t know any dealers, and the homegrown was of VERY limited supply.&nbsp; This forced my to only use for a few short weeks a year.<br />It was fun, but I decided one night to make laudanum by dropping all my pods into some vodka.<br />It was a frightening and dangerous experience.<br />The look on my wife&#039;s face said it all, and I haven&#039;t touched it since.<br /><br />My opinion is if you try it, only use a little, smoke it, and then stop.&nbsp; Then get some LSD or another hallucinogen with an introspective element and dose that a few days after the H to put it all into perspective.

				I would agree that opium can be used with relative safety for experimentation. I would actually recommend it as one of the natural entheogenic products from the earth that people should try. If you can find real, and high quality opium, it produces a wonderful, very relaxing and euphoric dream like state for the opiate intolerant... but like any opiate too much can be dangerous, because it is literally smoking morphine, codeine and a number of other psychoactive alkaloids. <br /><br />Biscuit, everyone&#039;s brain chemistry is remarkably unique. There are a number of tiny mutations in different receptors and second messenger pathways within neurons that can impact the susceptibility of an individual to a particular substance. Some people are resistant to the addictive properties of some drugs but could find others extremely addictive. Other people, with more direct susceptibilities to areas of the brain including the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, which are the main dopamine circuits involved in pleasure and reward, can be inherently more likely to become addicted to any substance. <br /><br />Plus your soul is stronger. Because even resistant individuals would surely become addicted if they let themselves do it too much...

				There is no smoke more delicious than opium... opiyummm<br /><br />mito, if you are patient they appear. Last week there were two decent listings (one expensive one also for the IR that are easier to bang, not for me). I saw a listing today but its for nearly 2.5 dollars per mg for the ER which is taking advantage of people even for SR! Thats ridiculous and I will pay $1/mg for oxycodone. When PV had them they were about $1.5/mg and fairly common actually is to see about 2 per. You should be warned that it is absolutely just as addictive as H, and that it will make your tolerance SKYROCKET unbelievably fast. Opana is so rare and amazing I saved a couple to ensure I can enjoy it later, because a new non-crush formula is being developed like the OPs.

				Have tried from eating real poppies, smoking Heroin to Opium. All gave similar feelings of emptiness and a numb mind. Except the Opium which added a different kind of euphoria. <br /><br />Was never addicted to it though.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s your life so if you want to fuck it up by becoming a heroin addict then go ahead. Not that you necessarily will become an addict but you might. I&#039;ve made tea from poppy pods a few times and never developed an addiction and have no desire to do them again. Maybe it&#039;s because it&#039;s time consuming to make and tastes like shit but it never really did it for me so I had no trouble stopping. YMMV. <br />I see no difference between the various opiates, they are all addictive to some degree whether your drinking tea or shooting heroin so don&#039;t get the idea that some are safe.

				If you want to experience a good opiate pick up a couple Opana 10 IR from MrDdroMcGillacutty. Snort half of one and see how you feel. A whole pill should have you nodding and maybe puking if you have no tolerance. Don&#039;t take them orally because they are only %10 absorbed that way(it&#039;s %40 snorted and %100 IV). It&#039;s my favorite prescription opiate with Diluadid a close second. And they&#039;re both just about as good as H. Try them first then decide if H is worth the risk.<br /><br />Nucleos&#039;s stuff is insanely strong and will kill you if you aren&#039;t careful. An experienced user here only needs 25 mg per shot which gives you an idea of the potency.

				I have done heroin. I am one of the lucky people that doesn&#039;t like it that much. But I warn you that many people enjoy heroin to the point that it ruins their life.

				10mg snorted is a good dose for a first time user with no tolerance?

				I would suggest against trying it - in particular trying very strong H for your first time.<br /><br />Many people die from H.... wish I&#039;d never tried it.<br /><br />

				10 mg should be safe even with the best H. Make sure to space out your use so you don&#039;t suffer withdrawal. Once you start getting sick without the drug, you&#039;re in trouble and will likely turn into a full blown addict doing whatever it takes to get your next fix.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sorry I tried H. I&#039;m sorry I shared needles and got hep C. :(
