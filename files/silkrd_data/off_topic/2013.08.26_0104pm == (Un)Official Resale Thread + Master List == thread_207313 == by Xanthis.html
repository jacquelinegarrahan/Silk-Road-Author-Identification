				I couldn&#039;t really find a thread like this with the same idea, or if it there was one, it was largely disorganized and not worth going through for the amount of information you got back. So, anywho.<br /><br />I was thinking we should create as comprehensive a list as possible of the current prices of whatever&#039;s popular and/or reliable on the road at the time, breaking it down to unit of currency over unit of measurement, and comparing it to our local street prices. I&#039;ve been planning on doing this myself, but I figured, might as well share the wealth and get input from the experts. And if anyone&#039;s feeling lazy, I&#039;ll simply create a master list in the original post and update it as needed, with currencies and units converted as requested. &#039;Sides, I enjoy making lists and breaking down statistics, and these&#039;re some of the more interesting, and profitable ones.<br /><br />So, if you&#039;ve got anything, I&#039;ll add it here, possibly with a flip multiplication factor, or profit margin, based on the price bought, with shipping options included, versus the price you sell it back at and calculate the difference.

				The vendor MushBud has been selling 10g packs of shroom powder VERY cheap the last few months. I bought them when they were $20 + $5 shipping. Resale on the packs is great, you can easily sell at $70+ locally and make a ton of profit very quickly. Just a thought 8)

				Very nice.<br /><br />The majority of NBOMes range from 9¢—30¢ for the powder, and from 32¢—$1 per hit with the blotters. Reliable powder vendors seem to be Someguy9191, and Chelonii. For tabs, there&#039;s Righteous, Family, UndergroundSyndicate, and Silo.<br /><br />They can be marketed as LSD, or as general acid substitute, and can be sold for about $5 a hit locally, or up to $10-$15 per hit if at an EDM event.<br /><br />Essentially, no matter what you do with them, they&#039;re profit, so long as you sell them for more than a dollar a hit.

NBOMe&#039;s can be shipped domestically for cheaper though.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t agree with misrepresenting what you&#039;re selling. It&#039;s the customers responsibility to know about the drug and it&#039;s the dealer&#039;s responsibility to tell them what it actually is. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been able to sell sheets for $300-450, except for Tyler&#039;s because his said 25-i on the back and I had to sell it for 150. I told everyone it was 25i anyways, but they wanted to resell as acid and that&#039;s not my problem.
