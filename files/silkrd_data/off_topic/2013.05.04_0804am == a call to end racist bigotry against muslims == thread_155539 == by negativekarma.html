				religion is just another control mechanism. Not to say God does not exist, just that God and Religion have nothing what-so-fucking-ever to do with one another. Islam may be shit, but the others are not much better. Have you seen what Catholics are doing in Africa? Denying people with AIDS access to condoms and telling them to practice &quot;Abstinence&quot;. What the fuck, you think that shit is any less evil than blowing people up with bombs? You think Jesus would be on the side of the religious right? The money changers? Why do you think Latin was the language of the Church for so long? To make it impossible for the peons to question their Priest, easier to maintain control then. Same reason they hated the printing press......god forbid the great unwashed should be able to educate themselves or make up their own minds.<br /><br />Hanging shit on Muslims and Islam is a good thing, but ONLY if you recognise all other religions deserve the same treatment. Otherwise you are just perpetuating the &quot;them against us&quot; mentality that the powers that be rely on to maintain their control. FUCK all control mechanisms, from religion to the petro-dollar.

I am an American and choose to be a Christian, although I do not believe in everything the Bible or Christianity has to teach us, I do identify with this faith. However, I hate when people say one faith is the &quot;one true faith&quot;, there is none, just various ways to learn and connect with the creator. <br /><br />I take issue with Muslims being lumped into one group that we point at as terrorist, slavers, and woman haters. This is not true. Islam is a religion of peace and those who commit terror are hurting their own people and do not represent the majority of Islam. The Arabs of Mauritania are have maintained chattel slavery over the black population in their country, not all Muslims, just the Arab Mauritanians. In the Arab world we see womens rights be tramples on daily, but this is through the Western perception. Women in Qatar for example are extremely liberated and have more advanced degrees than their husbands. <br /><br />We become fools when we seek to lump everyone together. All of Islam is not the same, imagine if all Christians and Jews had to take the blame for the actions of a minority. <br /><br />BTW America is so gun ho about protecting Israel because we share a Judeo Christian heritage....BULLSHIT. Christians have more in common with Muslims than Jews. Muslims belive in the Virgin birth of Christ, they also believe he will return to pass final judgement. Jews believe Jesus was just some carpenter who got to full of himself. <br /><br />The crimes that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people needs to be unveiled to the world. Israel is treating Palestinians worst than Jim Crow and Apartheid combined. Israel, through actions, are creating terrorist.

				I dont know...all religions have different interpretations and misrepresentations. I feel like we in the Western world regard freedom of religion as a supreme value, except if your a Muslim. Their are militant factions of all religions, except for maybe Buddhist. <br /><br />I think it is so wrong for the Western world to give Muslims the third degree about geopolitics without first acknowledging our part in the situation. For example, the problems in Iran today are of our making with past policies in regard to Iranian oil. The UK and the US has done a lot of shit in the Middle East and over the past decade it has really begun to stink. I know that the arab world too has fault, I think the lack of pragmatism in this discussion gives Radical Fundamentalist a great scapegoat <br /><br />Its a very dicey issue with a lot of various factors, but from what I&#039;ve seen our moral superiority in the west is eroding because of how we treat Arabs/Muslims&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Again I am a Christian and a very proud American and I am black...just calling a spade a spade

				BTW that soldier being hacked was a terrible crime, those bastards should burn. However, your government did not handle it correctly shooting one of them down in the streets, they should have captured him, tried him and publicly executed him. The UK has it pretty bad and it is because of US, we have given violent fanatics in the Muslim World a scapegoat to blame for their terrible acts.

				Islam is a crude plaigarism of the other Abrahamic religions conveyed by an illiterate eplieptic known as Mohammed. I have no time for any religions, but islam is one of the most despicable.

				There is definetly a diffrence between the various religiouns and what the practice.<br />Simple examply. Christian believe Jesus is god son of God. <br />Muslims believe Jesus is a prophet of God.<br />Hindus believe everything is god. Muslim believe everything is God&#039;s <br /><br />PS For a non muslim living in a Islamic state ruled by sharia would be much beter than for a muslim living in a western would. <br />Why? because if you as a non muslim (dimmi) living in a Islamic state you would be living under muslim protection.<br />You would be able to keep all you customs and believe and in time of war would not be could upon to fight and defend to state.<br />A muslim living in an western world would be called upon in time of war to fight. Even his own country.<br /><br />So for all those that made remarkes on this subject eat something bitter.
