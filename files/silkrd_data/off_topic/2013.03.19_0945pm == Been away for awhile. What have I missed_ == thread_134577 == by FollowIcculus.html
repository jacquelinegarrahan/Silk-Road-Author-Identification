				Hey everybody I broke my computer so I was off the road for awhile, about 6 monthes.&nbsp; What did I miss? New rules or security measures? Sellers gone bad?&nbsp; New guys with great stuff?&nbsp; Let me hear it!<br />Now I know some of you will want to say &quot;Dude don&#039;t be lazy, do a little browsing on the forums and find out for yourself.&quot; and to them I say of course, but I know that there are some of you who are bored, or high, and just like to chat so fill me in!

				Didn&#039;t miss much. . .&nbsp; Everyone anxiously waited for their packages and then got high.&nbsp; We laughed when John fell over the table and broke the glass.&nbsp; &nbsp;Marnie said you should get your cut like Steve&#039;s hair.<br /><br />Bit coin are waaaaay up in price.&nbsp; The cost of drugs remains the same though, and relative to the coin and US dollar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lots of new vendors ,&nbsp; great new guys looking to prove themselves.&nbsp; Really good new vendors .&nbsp; <br /><br />So, a glitch with accounts happened a few weeks back .&nbsp; Some accounts were showing tens of thousands of coins !! Just a calculation glitch though.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; <br /><br />A few busts happened around the world due to personal stupidity .&nbsp; The routine remains the same and working well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Aussies have it bad.&nbsp; Customs are scanning almost all packages regardless .&nbsp; Rough. <br /><br />A few news articles , but the same old story.&nbsp; <br />That&#039;s about it.

				Oh and Tony76&#039;s mother refused to let him have any icecream as a child so he took it out on all of his customers. I was not one of them, I just feel bad about anyone not being allowed access to icecream. It&#039;s not right.
