				Hello fellow SR&#039;ers-<br /><br />I very much enjoy tripping on LSD. I really enjoy the spiritual/visual aspects of it. That being said, I know very little about the RC out there. I&#039;ve also tried shrooms a couple of times which I enjoyed as well.<br /><br />Would anyone have suggestions for a cheaper psychedelic or is LSD on the cheaper end as far as psychedelics are concerned?

				Some of the 2C-x compounds might be up your alley...<br /><br />2C-P is similar to LSD in duration (perhaps a bit longer actually), and can be had on the cheap. It&#039;s very psychedelic, but it won&#039;t be the same &quot;feeling&quot; as LSD, just as shrooms are significantly different feeling from LSD. <br /><br />The DOx compounds are supposed to be somewhat similar, but they&#039;re all ridiculously long lasting. DOC is the shortest of them all, and it can last 18-24 hours (i believe).<br /><br />There just isn&#039;t anything in the world that&#039;s going to give the same vibe as LSD. It&#039;s such a unique molecule that only its direct analogs are going to give the same experience.<br /><br />And they&#039;re entirely unattainable.&nbsp; <br /><br />But DOx and 2C-x compounds are still very much psychedelics, and very cheap. Might be worth giving them a shot.<br /><br />euphoricknowledge.com has some great vendors which will blow the SR prices out of the water. You can pick up 2C-x, DOx, and DMT anologue compounds for 10 times cheaper than SR. If you&#039;re comfortable going that route, of course :)<br /><br />Edit - when I say cheap I mean buying the equivalent to 50 doses worth for 30-40 bucks... literally less than a dollar a trip.

				2C compounds are definitely your best bet... I have only experimented with 2-CE so far but it reminds me of a mix between LSD and mushrooms (more towards the LSD side)<br />but they are incredibly cost effective!

				purifiedwater- have you ever bought anything off euphoricknowledge? is it legal since the RC aren&#039;t technically scheduled substances yet? a psychedelic dollar menu sounds good to me!<br /><br />i think i&#039;ll definitely look forward to trying some of these things out. i just wanted to hear what you guys thought would be similar but you are certainly sparking my interest! hopefully i will branch out shortly&nbsp; ;)

				I made a series of purchases off the site back over the summer, 6 transactions with 4 vendors without a hitch. Top notch packaging. Lurk a bit and get to know the reputable sellers and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />It&#039;s clear net, so you&#039;ll need to be more careful, but buyer to vendor communication is using typical secure means. Tormail acct, and good vendors use PGP encryption so its pretty safe.<br /><br />Plus the compounds they&#039;re selling aren&#039;t illegal (technically), but they&#039;re definitely grey market. Vendors moving large quantities are at risk of getting pinched, but buyers of small quantities are in the clear.<br /><br />However, there are a dozen or so reputable vendors which you&#039;ll find meet the shipping/professionalism found on SR. There are others who are just there for a quick buck, and usually they&#039;re pretty good too. However, scammers are picked off quickly due to the tight-knight nature of the community. And they&#039;re somewhat more rare than on SR (for whatever reason).<br /><br />Just surf the &quot;swap meet&quot; section, it&#039;s a gold mine of RC&#039;s. <br /><br />I know there are other sites out there, but this is the one I use... its a pretty legit community.<br /><br />Maybe someone else can chime in with some other options.

				Out of all the RC psychedelics the cheapest and closest to acid I&#039;ve found are NBOMe&#039;s. Personally, I&#039;d pay any extra amount for actual LSD though. DOC and DOI are cheap but they&#039;re pretty intense in effects and duration and I would not recommend them unless you know you want a VERY intense and (physically) stimulating experience. It is really a crying shame how many people have been sold DOx as LSD because about all they have in common is they will wake you up and make you hallucinate but they are totally different drugs.<br /><br />If you like shrooms but want more bang for your buck, 4-AcO-DMT is quite inexpensive per dose and as close to psilocybin as you can get and unlike psilocybin it is legal most places. You can buy a quarter gram for 100 dollars or less at RC sites which is approximately 20 doses.&nbsp; But you will need a milligram scale if you&#039;re buying in that amount. Pm me if you&#039;re interested I can probably dig up a source

I didn&#039;t realize at the time LSD only lasts for up to 12 hours until posting in the forums and people corrected me. Anyway I&#039;m not mad about it as I still had a great time. It does seem to differ from LSD - however I don&#039;t trip enough (yet) to really grasp all the nuances of different trips. In due time.<br /><br />I will look into both sites. Thank you purifiedwater and selim for suggesting them.<br /><br />Additionally I will look into the various drugs everyone has been suggesting. Thanks everybody!<br /><br />
