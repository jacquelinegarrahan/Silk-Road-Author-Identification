				Hey guys, I have been having this problem in my sleep for about 5-6 years now and up until now I have just let it go as I am kind of used to it now.<br /><br />This is a long post so if anyone has any experience please read...<br /><br />Basically, its sleep paralysis. What happens is when I am lying in bed going to sleep sometimes (maybe once or twice a week on average) my body falls asleep before my mind. I know it sounds crazy but its a surreal and scary feeling. Anyone that has had this will understand. My body feels totally paralyzed but I can think at the same time. So imagine lying in bed, cant move your body but you can think at the same time...My breathing goes really shallow and I start to panic because it feels like I am going to stop breathing. I try to moan to get my partners attention. Sometimes it works and she wakes me out of it but others she says I wasn&#039;t making any noise. Sometimes I can move my toes slightly but I really have to strain to do it. Its really fuckin scary but I have sort of gotten used to it over the years but I always get that initial panic. Once I snap out of it and sit up, occasionally when I rest my head again it will happen straight away and I can feel my body becoming paralyzed again. How I stop this is I have to get up out of bed and go do something for a couple of minutes like have a cigarette or something to eat. Anyone else have any experience with this?<br /><br />Also, I get another thing that feels like electric shocks running through my brain. Its only 1 really quick one and my head will twitch right off the pillow. Then maybe 30 seconds later another one. It happens over and over and its not painful but it is in a way o_O If that makes sense...Its just like a shock to my brain...I even went to my GP and they could not explain this one...I might have to go see a specialist. If anyone has any similar experiences please let me know because im trying to find a solution to these...<br /><br />My GP put me on Endep which is &#039;Amitriptyline Hydrochloride&#039;. I didn&#039;t have any sleeping troubles for the first week but into the second week, wouldn&#039;t ya know it...My issue comes straight back so this Endep is not the answer. Someone help :(

				The body paralysis sounds similar to what I experience sometimes with my narcolepsy,my bodywill just slump over unexpectedly, but I fall into a deep sleep&nbsp; when it happens, sometimes illl wake slumped on the floor,bumps or bruises from falling, or a cold cup of coffee in my lap.&nbsp; Cataplexy I believe it&#039;s called. <br />You might want to see a sleep diorder specialist , sooner the better. My advise anyways.<br />

				Had pretty simalar shit happen to me when i was younger docs tryed heaps of things i found that endep fucked me up nervous system pain killer i think i remember, seroquel didnt help me sleep but does knock alot of other people out turned out i needed it as was a pscytso anyway so am still on 400mg of that a day but i digress it kept happening till I got on the hammer which i am not advocating at all but when i had a few years off later about 5 or so no more problem so i assume when i got older my body got used to sleeping normally <br />There are heaps of things to make your mind sleep stillnox, the benzo group maybe seroquel just keep trying different meds till you find one that works and doesnt give you side effects

It is only when I am going to sleep. Im sure he mentioned something about Cataplexy and then put me on those Endeps. I think a visit to the specialist is the right move..

At the time I was taking alot of party drugs too. Of course the recreational use did not last and it quickly turned into a habit. You know when you sometimes score some h and it makes it hard to sleep. You lay there, borderline asleep. Now I only use maybe once every couple of weeks and I am on 10mg of suboxone. Even when I stopped my habit the problem persists but I have always thought it may be linked to the gear because it started around the same time...
