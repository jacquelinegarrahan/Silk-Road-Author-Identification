				So, in 9 months or so of being here, ive noticed this trend..<br /><br />Why do so many people have the same fucking avatars? <br /><br />Example, Freddy Prince Jr. or Emilio Estevez.. Some others too i cant think of off the top, but does any one else notice how many members are using the same avatars as dozens of other members? Is there a reason that im just clueless to? Or am i totally bugging the frack out??

Jack And Hoff (admit it, you&#039;re a 2 user acc./ ? and one of you is a narc?), who are Jacking Off. That&#039;s why you chose Bill Clinton as your avatar right? b/c he had a blowjob in the oval office? &quot;Jacking Off&quot;? ::) ) I&#039;ll be. I haven&#039;t seen that movie but Brad Pitt and I have similar torsos so I feel I can relate somehow.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No and you lost me at the narc part. :o&nbsp; I have other forum accounts.&nbsp; I switch between forum accounts from time to time and I retire some and move to another.&nbsp; My writing style is different with each one but my opinions and statements remain true with each of them.&nbsp; I was bored one day and decided to make this troll account.&nbsp; Yes the name is jacking off.&nbsp; When I originally created this account, my avatar was a cock with a hand around it, it was apart of the jacking off name (SSBD remembers this, it got me reported a lot he&#039;s told me).&nbsp; I trolled in every thread with capitol letters saying something like &quot;JUST JACK OFF!&quot; or &quot;MASTURBATE IT OUT!!&quot; or talking about masturbating one way or another.&nbsp; Immature yes, but I was bored and high.&nbsp; I had about 50 posts with this account and I was logged in with this account and someone started a topic about government that I just couldn&#039;t refrain from voicing my opinion in so I made my first legitimate post with this account.&nbsp; Ever since then, I have helped and provided information with this account.&nbsp; I never really voiced my opinion very much or before this account.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have since went back and deleted all of my trolling posts.&nbsp; I made my avatar Clinton because he was my favorite US president. ;)<br /><br />You may notice that I never do reviews from this account or link my vendor profiles.&nbsp; That is because I had implicated myself way too many times with this account by talking about numerous seizures, selling drugs and shipping experiences.&nbsp; I feel it is in my best interest to use several forum accounts and not associate them with one another.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will probably kill this account off one day too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have plans for when, but the time will come to go back to another account or start a new one. ;)<br /><br />Oh Jack, he&#039;s a mystery. ;)

				Ha ha, yeah i took a guess. I figured someone with the variety of info you know doesn&#039;t fit the usual mould here, everyone sticks to just to just one specialty. Narc seemed a convenient choice. You&#039;ve been on this acc./ for too long at a time for a drug fuelled bender so I figured 2 people on 1 acc./. possibly at a police precinct lol. 28 posts per day is simply too much for 1 person -- that&#039;s a shit load.<br /><br />Awesome, I was right -- Jacking Off! Kinda half clever. ::) Ew, ferk, good choice with avatar. You&#039;re not a troll but sometimes you make out of character comments, can never figure out who is who. Can&#039;t remember trolling though. So.... wrong about Clinton avatar. Yeah you are helpful usually -- not always, usually -- which made me wonder a bit about being LE. <br /><br />Ah. So now we have the truth. Shit, I feel like I&#039;m in a movie. All this time people have been screaming &quot;shill army&quot; at me, and I find all this stuff lol. So maybe there IS a shill army! samesame was right! :o Someone has 417 shills carefully hidden and &quot;groomed&quot; like one paranoid member posted. Be afraid. But I wouldn&#039;t kill the acc./ off with a high post count b/c that trivializes any hard work accumulated. Each username has a story.<br /><br />Hmm................................<br /><br />That was different actually.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
