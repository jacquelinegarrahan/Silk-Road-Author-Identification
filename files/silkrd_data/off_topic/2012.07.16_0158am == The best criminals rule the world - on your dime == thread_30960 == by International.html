				A few years ago I learned of one of the largest gold scam in the worlds history, and it goes all the way up to the federal reserves highest members and men of authority within the IMF. In 2009 the United States transferred some gold bars to China. These gold bars were directly from the highly secured United States gold vaults. Its very typical for countries to exchange gold to one another for debts and trade purposes. However, the kicker is that these gold bars, directly from the US gold reserve were gold plated bars of tungsten. Over 1,00,000 400OZ gold bars were actually found to be gold plated tungsten. Each 400OZ gold bar has an approx market value of $640,000 each. This scandal allowed criminals in upper positions within the US government to walk away with billions. In a day and age where kids are forever barred from federal funds for simple possession of weed this is a travesty. This scandal has also been tucked away, with almost every major news network simply not acknowledging it ever happened. This scandal is well documented and it is 100% fact. Its one of the greatest thefts that you never heard about read more about it here<br /><br />&quot;One of the world&#039;s super powers decided to do a more in-depth &quot;special&quot; inspection over their gold in storage, received as a normal exchange for other governments to pay off debts and loans. During this check they performed a test where they drilled four small hole in the gold bars to check the purity and weight of the bars, and much to their surprise they found out the the bars were in fact gold-plated tungsten bars. The country was very upset and decided to back trace the serial number to see who the culprit was, and to an ever more astonishing surprise, they found that the bars traced back to the largest government world power to date!<br /><br />Sound like a fictional movie plot? Yeah, didn&#039;t think so, it lacked spunk. In any case, welcome to reality.<br /><br />This is in fact a story that happened back in October of 2009. China supposedly received 5,600 to 5,700 gold bars from the USA in exchange to pay off their debts (well, some of it anyway) and China decided to do a special test on them before storing them in the vaults of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA, for short). Upon inspection they found that the core of the gold bars was tungsten. The serial number traced back to the United States Bullion Depository in Fort Knox.<br /><br />Apparently these bars were manufactured roughly 15 years ago, during the Clinton Administration by a &quot;highly sophisticated refiner in the USA&quot;. The original shipment of tungsten blanks included about 1.3 to 1.5 million 400 oz bars, 640,000 of which were shipped to Fort Knox. According to the Chinese investigation, the 1.3 to 1.5 million accentually &quot;salted bars&quot; were allegedly sold into the international market shortly after being manufactured.<br /><br />But the rabbit hole goes deeper.<br /><br />former International Monetary Fund&#039;s Chief who went under some heat for having alleged sex scandals with a luxury hotel maid.<br /><br />Major news sources, like New York Times, covered the reason for his resignation was &quot;to focus on proving his innocence&quot;. As focused as Mr. Strauss-Kahn would like to be on clearing his allegations, I don&#039;t buy it. Instead, I have focused my attention on the smaller sources that have linked Mr. Strauss-Kahn to this odd web of deception.<br /><br />It shouldn&#039;t come to you as a shock to see governments, the USA in particular, using &quot;sex scandals&quot; as a form of degradation and replacement (I&#039;ll explain later). After all, when the notorious WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, was being flushed out, they simply slapped some sex scandals on his image, notified the proper authorities, and allowed the media to amplify the story. Within hours, we had heard that they were trying to take Assange and try him under the Swiss laws. Like I said, a form of replacement.<br /><br />Anyways, back to Strauss-Kahn. So, it&#039;s been stated, by the Federal Security Service (FSB) secret report (?) that he had become &quot;increasingly concerned&quot; after the USA had began stalling on their pledged delivery to IMF of 191.3 tons of gold agreed to under the Second Amendment of the Articles of Agreement signed by the Executive Board in April 1978 that were to be sold to fund what are called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as an alternative to what are called reserve currencies.<br /><br />Around this same time, Strauss-Kahn was said to have been contacted by rogue elements within the CIA to provide him with firm evidence that the US was clean-dry out of gold. After hearing this revelation, he made immediate arrangements to leave the US and return to Paris, but when contacted by agents working for France’s General Directorate for External Security (DGSE) that American authorities were seeking his capture he fled to New York City’s JFK airport following these agents orders not to take his cell-phone because US police could track his exact location (reminds me of a scene in The Golden City).<br /><br />Unfortunately Strauss-Kahn made the mistake of attempting to contact his hotel to get them to forward his cell phone to his French residence. That&#039;s all that it took to track him to his Air France flight and apprehend him on alleged sex crimes.<br /><br />So now we&#039;re left at a cross-road.<br /><br />On one hand you can either believe the so-called facts laid out before you, or, you can shrug it off as all just another conspiracy theory concocted by those who have no basis for any of their stories. Whatever the case, I for one believe the truth is never quite so simple and won&#039;t always be plastered all over CNN&#039;s front page news. I believe that you must not only do some physical searching, but also one must search within themselves for that tug that is always pulling towards the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Stay Free<br /><br />-ParadoX<br /><br /><br />

				&quot;Government, Even in it&#039;s best state, is but a necessary evil&quot; Thomas paine. <br />They put up their laws and then break them, Most of them that do it never get caught. There is probably a lot more corruption then we may see. When we designed this Government it was about the people, Now it&#039;s about the money. So this gold bar thing really doesn&#039;t surprise me all that much.
