				LSD is for me... i get totally immersed in the movie....like i&#039;m there. when something happy happens in the movie, my eyes fill with tears of joy... when something scary happens, i fear for my life. I love being that immersed in a movie. but..... problem is, I can&#039;t use LSD every day....and I want to watch movies every day.....weed is good, but only for the right kind of movies. <br /><br />amophetamines are nice too.....<br /><br />....................

				Agreed...<br />LSD+The Tree of Life/Enter the Void= complete destruction of my religion and me thinking that i am falling into the void during the DMT trip in Enter the Void :) Both are pretty mindblowing either way but i recommend it!

				Weed, alcohol or LSD.<br />I can not sit still on amphetamine. Even small amounts make me wanna get stuff done. TV just seems like a waste of time. Unless I have amphetamine + weed or alcohol to drown it out.

				Shrooms aren&#039;t good for movies, I once watched a horror movie which scared the shit out of me and once I watched Blow and then I was super sad in the end and cried when the scene with his daughter appeared.<br />Weed isn&#039;t good neither because I fall asleep then.

				LSD is good but for me it depends. If I watch movies with stories structured like Hollywood productions I can&#039;t watch them much. All seems far more fake than usually and if I decompose the story it seems so easy structured that I actually feel getting more fooled. But again it depends. One time I watched some horrible movie I even can&#039;t recall the name of it but I was more aware of the details and I started to see some aspects of one actors finely crafted work and it actually seemed so good that rest of the trip I was all in that poetical and theatrical mood and all my thoughts were how beautiful it is if you see the rare character who can make poetry fully alive.

				I remeber when Lord of the Rings came out in the theaters I went with some friends to watch it and we had shrooms. One dude it was his first time and we freaked the fuck out. I think it was the second Lord of the Rings the one with the talking trees. That totally fucked him up. He was mentally scared after needing therapy and what not lol...never the same dude again.

				I usually will just smoke pot, but even then I prefer to do other things while baked, like a play a video game or go outside and kick a ball around.&nbsp; Had a bad experience watching one of the earlier sad-ish episodes of the Simpsons while on shrooms and also a bad experience doing a tad too much ketamine during a really intense/sad part of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

				Opiates and weed are the best. Benzos you forget what&#039;s going on. Stimulants better for gaming (not a stim person anyways though). Ketamine/MXE is also a good choice but usually I forget what&#039;s going on (better for gaming).

Benzos you forget what&#039;s going on. Stimulants better for gaming (not a stim person anyways though). Ketamine/MXE is also a good choice but usually I forget what&#039;s going on (better for gaming).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Stimulants are good for gaming in a way... But if you get stuck on a level and can&#039;t get past it, you just sit there for hours staring at the screen and if you can&#039;t get past it makes you angry and frustrated. Well this might not happen for everyone, but it happens to me. I could sit there for 6 hours on speed and barely even take a break from staring at the screen.<br /><br />Makes you better at the game though

				I would not waste any psychedelic on watching TV/movies when the best movie is the one produced in my head.<br />Beer &amp; cigarettes &amp; reeefers are OK. ;)
