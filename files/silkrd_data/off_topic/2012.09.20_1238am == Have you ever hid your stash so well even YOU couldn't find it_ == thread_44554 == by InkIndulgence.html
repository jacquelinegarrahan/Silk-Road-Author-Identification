				With xanax I DEFINITELY believe that.<br /><br />The rare occasions that I&#039;m in super fiend mode I&#039;m always so sure that I must have dropped, forgot about, or otherwise hid that LAST bit from a long time ago that I can never find. And on the even more rare times that you DO find drugs that you forgot about or didn&#039;t know were there it is like the GREATEST feeling ever like they shine gold light when you find them and angels sing.

				haha yeah. The plus about having a serious drug collection for a while is stumbling upon random goodies down the road. <br /><br />One time I had some xanax and ambien in my car&#039;s cupholder, and they somehow slid under the center console. That weekend I got in there with a toolbox and flashlight and salvaged probably half of them. It was a hell of an effort.

				When ever there is xanax involved I always think I have more xanax left after coming back from the daze.&nbsp; Always ends up that I finished the rest...<br /><br />Only other times I forget is when I smoke insane amounts of bud and hide it.&nbsp; Wake up then it hits me that I have totally no idea where I put my stash.&nbsp; Worse feeling.

				I&#039;ve never purposely hid anything and lost it, but I&#039;ve sure as fuck accidentally lost track of my stash a number of times.&nbsp; Just the other day I found my favorite kief scoop and an amber vial with a few hundred milligrams of DMT in it.. SCORE!!! I fucking lost these two months ago and had no clue what happened to them until now.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even mind that I lost them though because whenever I misplace something, I know I must have been pretty fucking baked which can&#039;t help but make me grin at the thought. ;D<br /><br />On a slightly different note, anyone ever lose something that in order to find you&#039;ve had to toke up to fully retrace your steps? :P

				Yup, hunted high and low, and lost all hope. Two years on, found my stash inside a book, nice surprise too as it was still okay, it was a good vintage! :P I don&#039;t use books anymore to hide stuff, because I have far too many. Lesson learnt!

				i actually had an OC 40 i though i knew where it was, but couldnt find it in a drawer full of junk. then after i couldnt get the OCs and only had roxy... it was my birthday and i was in the drawer again, happened to stumble upon the pill which was the best freaking b-day present i got. like a little treat saved for myself<br /><br />sometimes i actually try to hide things from myself just so if i am in dire need of something i can search through all my spots and hopefully something will be stashed somewhere<br /><br />i used to get so frustrated with these liquid caps of xanax we made one summer, cause i could never freaking remember where i stashed them each time they got moved. now my benzos stay in one place

One time I hid it my back pocket which I was sure that it couldn&#039;t get lost, because I never put stuff there, but then I got high and well I woke up next morning and totally forgot about it. I thought I had smoked it all or something checked all my pockets(but not the back one, because I NEVER PUT STUFF THERE) and then muttered in lowered voice the rest of the day... &lt;.&lt; When I found it a week later it had gone through a wash :( <br /><br />Second time I hid my stash was when I put it in a picture frame which hanged in my bathroom and well I forgot it there for about 2 months, but when I finally found it... It was like a miracle had happened I was so overwhelmed by the fact that I just found 1-2Gs of weed, lol.<br /><br />3rd time which was well rather lately,(which wasn&#039;t caused by me, but is still funny) I was starting to bake with 2 lady friends when one of them said that we should get some food from the inside before we start. So we did and when we came back outside the bag o&#039;weed was nowhere to be found... We started tearing the bags of the ladies apart, then while I searched the ground with my phone, those 2 were searching inside. They cleaned out both of their bags, they searched all the places where it could&#039;ve possibly been and finally we found it! While cleaning out their bags, they had automatically thrown the bag to the trashcan &lt;.&lt;........<br /><br />And the last thing is the 0,5-1G weed I put somewhere for a good night and I just can&#039;t remember where I put it ffs... I guess I&#039;ll find it some day. :/<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Years ago I worked at a restaurant and had one of those coca-cola stash cans, I kept around a 1/2 oz of herb in there for lunch breaks and whatever I needed to get through the day.&nbsp; It was a pizza joint so they had a solid supply of coke on hand and I would usually just stash the can on the next pallet down as a daily practice. Was a good system for a few months until I went on a vacation for a couple of days and forgot that I left my stash at the restaurant. Came back searching for it to no avail, never heard anything from my manager or anything, so I assume someone had some fun with it. Still cracks me up when I think about that.

				Ha, when i was selling a lot of pot and hash i used to this all the time. Most of the time though, I&#039;d stash an extra ounce or two away somewhere, and then totally forget about it. A few weeks later my girlfriend would clean the apartment and find a fat block of hash, or a jar full of pot. Always a good time.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been on the level i used to though, so it&#039;s been awhile since I could stash an ounce or two and not even notice..

				true story! I once lost my stash - 3/4&#039;s of an ounce of old school prop-dope! I had been going for 3 weeks with zero sleep, cutting glass for this huge stained glass dragon with a scorpion&#039;s tail and huge open purple wings! Any way it was taking forever! And my sis was showing up in one month. I&#039;d add the Onion Image Uploader link to it but IT (OIU) seems to have been misplaced - where the hell did it go anyway!<br /><br />So after 3 weeks of not eating, not sleeping, bent over this Redwood table I use to cut glass on - day in/night out - and started seeing things that weren&#039;t there! So when the baggie disappeared I just went and re-upped and forgot about it. 1 year later I got evicted because the Landlord sold my house and pretty much had everything moved to my new place. The last pallet in the basement I lifted up - PLOP! - the baggie fell through to the concrete floor! <br /><br />No shit! AND, it just so happened I&#039;d been out for about 2 weeks. - No &#039;cake&#039; to buy more! AND it was fantastic. Nothing special - just a sandwich baggie in a very cold dark basement! I didn&#039;t know Meth would stay good that long! But it was really good!

				One time I must have been so high that a bunch of pills slipped out into my girlfriend&#039;s panty drawer. <br /><br />Weeks later, when I was putting away the laundry so I could get some ;), I found a bunch of pills at the bottom of her panty drawer. <br /><br />Funniest feeling to have a hard on for the imagery the panties conjure up in your mind while putting them away for he and for the erection turbo boost you get for finding pills that shouldn&#039;t even be there in the first place, but there they were nevertheless. <br /><br />It&#039;s like getting an award for being a helpful horny bastard while God winks at you.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I was packing up my books for a move last July and I pulled A Most Wanted Man off my shelf only to find a bag of shrooms that had been sandwiched between it and another book. Then I made the mistake of taking the shrooms then and there only to remember I had a date with this girl at a Sushi bar we&#039;d been going to a lot around that time. Most disgusting food to eat while tripping, as far as I&#039;ve experienced anyway. <br />Had a similar experience with weed, only I&#039;d accused an acquaintance of stealing from me. God did I feel like a shit head after that.<br />Currently I&#039;m searching for an empty vial that probably has trace amounts of DMT. Not a smokeable quantity by any means, but more than enough for a arrest, if it ever came to that.

				We hid some weed (a tiny amount really)&nbsp; in the muti-storey carpark, of an hotel, in Bangkok, Thailand. And came back after a month, and never ever found it, and we spent HOURS going over where we thought it was while trying not to look suspicious to any passing security patrols and car park users...

				Literally found my personal stash of green in a ziplock bag inside of a protein tub, inside of my pantry about 3 months after I realized that it was lost.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never cleaned my place so many times in 3 months.&nbsp; I even scrubbed the floor under the oven after looking there...&nbsp; stupid me :)
