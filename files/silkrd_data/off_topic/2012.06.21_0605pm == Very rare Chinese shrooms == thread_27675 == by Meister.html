It&#039;s got a nose and an eye, but we have no idea what it is,&quot; one said.<br /><br />The perplexed villagers decided to call up their local TV station for help and intrepid reporter Ye Yunfeng was quickly dispatched to the scene.<br /><br />She put together an in-depth piece about the unidentified &#039;meaty&#039; mushroom, including numerous close-ups of her grasping the strange object.<br /><br />She said: &quot;We can see there is something like a mouth; and on the other side there is a hole that connects all the way through to the other end. It is very smooth. It feels very much like meat.&quot;<br /><br />Ye claimed that it was a rare medicinal Taisui mushroom, which needed very specific conditions in which to grow.<br /><br />However,a number of viewers called up the TV station to say that the mystery &#039;mushroom&#039; was actually a sex toy for men.<br /><br />One commented online: &quot;How do you not know the difference between silicone and an organic fungus??&quot;<br /><br />The news station posted an apology on Sina Weibo, a Chinese blogging website, the following day.<br /><br />&quot;Our reporter is very young and sheltered,&quot; it said, expressing regret for an &#039;uncomfortable and misleading&#039; report.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hilarious, reporter picking it up and commenting on the texture and a supposed expert comes on explaining how rare of a mushroom it is, then it turns out to be a fake vagina on one side and asshole on the other, Oh I&#039;m sorry a &#039;nose&#039; and an &#039;eye&#039; haha, I&#039;m assuming the clit was the nose?
