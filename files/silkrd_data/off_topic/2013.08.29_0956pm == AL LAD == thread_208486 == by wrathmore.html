				So Ive been speaking to some friends at the laboratory and been told they have a load of AL LAD for me. I havnt tried this stuff yet and will be sampling it while away for the next few weeks. Im looking at ordering us loads of it to sell on here and wondered if i could some feedback on users who have experienced it...like it, want it, hate it etc. Wont be selling it until a months time but wanna know if its worth the investment before we go for it!<br /><br />AL-LAD, also known as 6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a hallucinogenic drug and an analogue of LSD. So far it seems as good as the real stuff according to a few ive spoken to.<br /><br />Cheers, thanks for the help (if there is any to come)<br /><br />

				cheers for that, +1 :) <br /><br />Im not sure if they are a new lab but i know they have a lot of it. We can also get grams of acid (crystal) but its most certainly NOT cheap! Im away next week for a month on business so will be posting in the forums but me and my partner will be unable to sell until we return hopefully with lots of this AL LAD!

				If it&#039;s truly &#039;like LSD&#039; and doesn&#039;t cost nearly as much (Acid is fuckin&#039; expensive!), I&#039;d certainly be interested in purchasing some secure-to-ship and easy-to-dose AL=LAD blotters.<br /><br />Count me in!

Slightly different but every bit as good, and a great price. He is one of the best around as vendors go.
