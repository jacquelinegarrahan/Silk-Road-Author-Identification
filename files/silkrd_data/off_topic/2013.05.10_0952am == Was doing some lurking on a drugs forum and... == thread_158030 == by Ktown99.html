				These guys are bitching about the sad state of Mdma in the country. All they do is post first person reports about the latest pill. 100% every pill is shit and has ZERO MDMA and leaves them strung out and hating life or gives them nothing at all. <br /><br />The merest mention of SR is banned on the forum and they call people who use it fools and if they get caught they deserve it and their use of SR is an indication of how stupid they are. <br /><br />Reading all that shit makes me realise how lucky I am to:<br /><br />1. Have my hands on amazing drugs<br />2. Supply my close friends with amazing drugs<br /><br />There&#039;s an ignorant belief that buying drugs via SR and having them mailed successfully makes you the luckiest person in the world and that its only a matter of time before you are caught. <br /><br />I feel so sad for these guys. Desperate to feel the amazing rush of real MDMA, yet they fuck around on a forum telling each other how shit the &#039;drugs&#039; are in their city. What a sad fucking life that is.

				The stupid ones are the people that meet dodgy dealers for dodgy drugs in dodgy places in full site of prying eyes!! I would say the risk is a lot greater for people buying of the street than of the road! I don&#039;t have the chance of the police turning up mid deal when i use the road. Plus even if the drugs get found in the mail it can be very hard for them to be linked to anyone.<br /><br />SR all the way!!!!

				I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of such a pathetic bunch of users before. By the sounds of things they would have a shit time taking any drugs. <br /><br />What the fuck is the point of taking AND complaining about shit drugs when the worlds best are at your god damn finger tips?!<br /><br />Come on guy! If you&#039;re sick and tired of something and continue to do exactly as before then you deserve to have a shit time insulfating pink chalk!<br /><br />Sorry OP either school these fuckers or to save yourself the pain of watching total losers, leave and never go back unless of course they serve as a reminder of what lost opportunities. <br /><br />

				Well in situations like these you know what they say &quot;more for me&quot;&nbsp; ;D. Speaking of which I&#039;ve actually been looking at some MDMA. I&#039;ve never been interested in the stuff but lately I&#039;ve been wanting to mingle a bit more but I completely suck socially do any of you guys think it will work for me? <br /><br />Alcohol works, the strong stuff always helps me to open up a bit more real fast but lately I&#039;ve been wanting to see how MDMA works for me with the socializing, not to mention I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s safer than alcohol and for me probably would be better since when I drink a lot my stomach always gets upset or I end up throwing it all up by the end of the night.

It will make you care a lot less about what you say to others and more open with emotions. If i have a bit to drink and then take molly i can literally talk for hours and this isn&#039;t usually like me! I will talk about anything and will be a lot more open so when trying to be social these are usually good things. You can get next day regrets though about some of the things you have said!!!

				Alright thank you for the suggestion I will surely look into the two a bit more. I&#039;m still contemplating on rather I actually want to try it or not but I know trying it can&#039;t hurt after all these years and I still suffer badly at holding a full conversation with people that I don&#039;t know and even with some of the one&#039;s that I do know it&#039;s still difficult to do, very frustrating.

Well MDMA will have your eyes rolling all over the shit. <br /><br />For mephedrone try Limetless or Goldust.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I both agree and disagree with this - in small doses mephedrone is wonderful if you&#039;re wanting to get socially active and you are normally not a chatty Kathy. That being said, it is *for me* very fiendly and does not have as long a half-life as MDMA so it leaves you wanting more quickly.<br /><br />I mean, I love love LOVE mephedrone. It&#039;s just addictive as all hell. Especially if you blow it or even more especially if you use it rectally. I&#039;ve rolled harder from rectal administration of meph than I have from ANYTHING.<br /><br />I&#039;m always the person to recommend this to people because it is still my favorite drug out of all the empathogens, but if you want social activeness with a nice euphoria that isn&#039;t *too* pushy you should try methylone. M1 has me wanting to socialize with everyone, and it has a nice body feeling to it as well. You can also do a little bit more of it and not feel like shit a couple days after.<br /><br />That being said, it is also pushy and it WILL make you feel like death if you&#039;re taking it every day. I remember at one point I had 50 grams to sell and I stood to make a few thousand dollars but I turned into a fiend and wound up ingesting 350+ mgs in the morning, before lunch, and mid-day. I felt nothing from it, too. Just tweaked out hatred for everything.<br /><br />But that&#039;s just the worst case scenario, don&#039;t let that discourage you from trying meph or methylone or MDMA. It&#039;s all about self control. After an incident that left me almost hospitalized I learned that lesson and now if I&#039;m gonna do stimulants I keep the usage down to at the very most a couple times a week for meph or methylone or every month or so for MDMA. Your serotonin receptors will thank you for that. :P<br />

				buying on the street without contacts is unbearable in almost any larger city, there are tons of dealers but they almost all sell shit, here in Vienna its quite bad,&nbsp; majority of pills sold as MDMA contain either: very low mdma dosage;&nbsp; &nbsp;nothing (like pure caffeine),&nbsp; &nbsp;or similar, cheaper and often way more dangerous chemicals, H and Coke are cut to shit, even the fucking weed (that is not very potent to begin with)is cut with plant material, sand, sugar, brix&nbsp; or other stupid shit, in Graz someone sold weed cut with fucking lead, people getting heavy metal poisoning for buying fucking weed.&nbsp; Most of those dealers are a real disgrace to humanity.... A few month ago the police arrested a dealer who wanted to sell shit (real feces) as hash!<br /><br />Long live the road, never buy of the street again, at least it proves that at this time in this world we live in, some freedom is still possible!
