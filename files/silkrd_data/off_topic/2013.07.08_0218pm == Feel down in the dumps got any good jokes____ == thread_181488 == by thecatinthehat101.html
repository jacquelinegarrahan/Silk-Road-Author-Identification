				One afternoon a lawyer was riding in his limousine when he saw two men along the road-side eating grass.<br /><br />Disturbed, he ordered his driver to stop and got out to investigate.<br /><br />He asked one man, &quot;Why are you eating grass?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We don&#039;t have any money for food,&quot; the poor man replied. &quot;We have to eat grass.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, then, you can come with me to my house and I&#039;ll feed you,&quot; the lawyer said. &quot;But sir, I have a wife and two children with me. They are over there, under that tree.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bring them along,&quot; the lawyer replied.<br /><br />Turning to the other poor man he stated, &quot;You may come with us, also.&quot;<br /><br />The second man, in a pitiful voice, then said, &quot;But sir, I also have a wife and six children with me!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Bring them all as well,&quot; the lawyer answered.<br /><br />They all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limousine.<br /><br />Once under way, one of the poor fellows turned to the lawyer and said, &quot;Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you.&quot;<br /><br />The lawyer replied, &quot;Glad to do it. You&#039;ll really love my place. The grass is almost a foot high.&quot;

				A man walks into a petrol station and says, &quot;Can I please have a KitKat Chunky.&quot; The lady behind the till gets him a KitKat Chunky and brings it back to him.<br /><br />&quot;No,&quot; says the man, &quot;I wanted a normal KitKat, you fat bitch.&quot;<br /><br />--<br /><br />&quot;Did you know that making a girl laugh is the second best way to get a girl into bed?&quot; I asked my date.<br />&quot;Really?&quot; she asked. &quot;What&#039;s the first?&quot;<br />&quot;A big fuck off knife!&quot; I replied.<br />&quot;Ha-ha, you&#039;re funny,&quot; she said.<br />&quot;Well done, you&#039;ve made a sensible choice.&quot; <br /><br />--<br /><br />My PC takes such a long time to shut down I&#039;ve decided to call it Nelson Mandela.

				A man walked in to a bar after a long day at work. As he began to drink his beer, he heard a voice say seductively &quot;You&#039;ve got great hair!&quot; The man looked around but couldn&#039;t see where the voice was coming from, so he went back to his beer.<br /><br />A minute later, he heard the same soft voice say &quot;You&#039;re a handsome man!&quot; The man looked around, but still couldn&#039;t see where the voice was coming from.<br /><br />When he went back to his beer, the voice said again &quot;What a stud you are!&quot; The man was so baffled by this that he asked the bartender what was going on.<br /><br />The bartender said &quot;Oh, it&#039;s the nuts--they&#039;re complimentary.&quot;
