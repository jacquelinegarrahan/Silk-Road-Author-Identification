				&quot;My First Trip&quot; -- liquid LSD<br /><br />Let me just say this is the most powerful mind **** drug I&#039;ve ever done still to this day. I&#039;ve done paper tabs and cubes multiple times after first doing the liquid, and taking even 6-7 tabs did not even come close to 1 drop of the liquid. I had never tripped before on anything, and the only drugs I&#039;d done prior were weed and some pharmys. <br /><br />About 5-6pm a normal saturday in November i believe, me and a group of about 10 friends are downtown having a jolly ol time when we come across our buddy &#039;TJ&#039; who lives right in that area. He is probably the scummiest kid in our grade but he is cool. He pulls out a Visine bottle and tells us it&#039;s acid. Next thing I know everyone is taking a drop. We&#039;ve got like 4 girls (think lacrosse team captain type girls) with us and even they do it. I&#039;m like whatever so I take a drop, and he tells us that they are goign to be camping out in the woods later and we should come along. We are freshman in highschool btw. <br /><br />We depart, im in my friends old bronco II (balla) and we dont feel anything for a long time. It&#039;s like over an hour so I&#039;m just like whatever this sh*t is garbage. We start to head out to the &#039;campground&#039; to meet up with the other kids, like 20 in all, we are meeting the pot-head-druggie group of kids that we know but arent tight with. They are infamous in our school for all kinds of sex parties and tripping at school etc. Actually one of them, my boy, was murdered in 2003 but that is another story<br /><br />we park the bronco on some side road and we are so far out into the countryside that I have no idea where we are. We drove over an hour to get to this spot , and there are just farms and woods, nothing else. <br /><br />While we are walking to the camp ground, theres like 20 ppl and they are all like &#039;damn i am tripping my ass off!!&#039; . I am feeling nothing... but after about 10 more minutes, <br /><br />BAM<br /><br />The **** hit me like a 100mph brick wall. I went from 100% sober to 100% ****ing tripping my ass off insanity. And this is was NOT an easy hike to our campground at all. We had to jump rocks across a large creek, we had to pass through multiple barbed wire fences and electric fences that were for cattle, and then there was this CLIFF, that we had to walk up, like a 45 degree grade where if you fell off you&#039;d fall 15 feet into the creek. So we finally get to the campsite , which is on a farmer&#039;s land that we do not know at all, but TJ says it&#039;s cool and they&#039;ve camped there before. <br /><br />At this point, I am completely out of my mind. I am seeing indian spirits in the fire (it is dark now) , and we are sitting in a circle around the fire, drinking beer and smoking pot. There ar elike 5 guys there that I&#039;ve never met before, redneck dudes that trailblazed our path there that knew TJ or something. <br /><br />I thought they were all cops. Like 100% thought they were police. I remember just staring into the fire looking at all the indian spirit&#039;s faces and thinking about how this is their land, how we are white infidels on their stolen land, and how they suffered. I also thought that in the darkness around us, all of our parents were there. I could see tons of faces in the darkness , hundreds of faces, men and women, and I thought that they were all our parents, and that my parents were out there also. It was really freaky feeling like my parents were watching me here with these kids. I knew that this was some kind of &#039;test&#039;. They were testing us right now, to see who of us would go to heaven, and who of us would go to hell. <br /><br />during all of this, everyone is talking about this hurricane that is supposed to be coming, and that we are going to be hit by a hurricane. it started to rain lightly.<br /><br />We were sitting in two main circles, with two fires. I&#039;ll try to keep this simple, but basically I knew in my mind, that I had to move around the circles (think figure 8 style) and exit the circles in order to go to heaven and not be trapped with them in hell. So I stood up and slowly moved one place at a time until I eventually was towards the &#039;exit&#039; (the way we came). Somebody noticed that I was bugging out, and they were like &#039;hey what are you doing?&#039; and I said something to the extent of &#039;I am not going to hell with you guys. I&#039;m going to go to heaven!&#039; and I started to leave (walk back). <br /><br />They r like where are you going? and I said I&#039;m walking home, which was impossible because we were so far away. They all started freaking out saying that I was going to get them caught and they couldnt let me go. One of the redneck kids tried to physically keep me there (they decided it would be bes to knock me out) , and I wrestled this dude (i was probably 125 lbs at the time ) who was much much bigger then me until i escaped , probably a good 5 minute wrestling match which involved some punches exchanged. Eventually they said fine, let him go, and I left. <br /><br />Thus began my journey. <br /><br />I returned to them. I couldnt tell you why except for the same reason that a moth goes towards a light. I kept walking back to the fire, and every time they&#039;d be like &#039;hey he&#039;s back!&#039; and I&#039;d be like &#039;DAMMIT! I didnt mean to come back&#039; , and leave again. <br /><br />I was so determined that I&#039;d get home, it was like I was Jesus on a mission to save mankind. A lot of **** happened on the way back but I&#039;ll just keep to the biggest stuff-- <br /><br />1. I walked straight through the creek without a second thought about how to get over it. It was ****in cold but that didnt phase me at all. <br />2. I came to the electric fence... and when I was going to go through it (only top wire is active), i had this crazy feeling in my body. I couldnt figure otu what it was , it must have taken me 5 minutes to figure it out. I was holding the top wire. I finally let it go and was like wtf , and went through the fence.<br />3. I spooked a circle of horses, black horses, and they were running in a circle. This was the craziest ****in thing i&#039;ve ever seen or done probably, instead of walking around them, for whatever reason, I only understood to walk through them. I timed my walk so that I walked through the circle without being trampled. (my friends later claimed these were cows but to this day i swear they were horses) <br /><br />After about a mile or so through other treacherous terain, I finally got to the road. It was one of the most triumphant moments of my life. Looking back over the field, the horses, everything, was so beautiful. The rain was hitting the electic fences and little sparks were coming off. Everything was purplish from the moon.. i cant describe this scene but it was so amazing i stood there at least 15 minutes just looking. Then i walked down the road, wet up to my torso, starting my walk home. I had no idea where I was going. When I got to the first house, I decided I&#039;d take a rest. It is like 12PM now (this timeline is a bit ****ed up but it was bout midnight when i got to the house), I decide to sit down in the middle of this guys yard, in a shadow of a tree being cast from his porch light, so that i wouldnt be seen. <br /><br />the very SECOND that I sit down in the shadow, a car pulls into his driveway. The man gets out of his car and walks up to his front door, and I get up and walk up to the man and out of nowhere hatch an elaborate scheme. I say <br /><br />&quot;Excuse me sir, do you mind if I come in and use your phone? My friends told me that we were going camping, and then they ditched me in the woods.&quot; -- I also was speaking in a NY accent (no idea why) , and I had absolutely no intention of actually using his phone. Total scam. <br /><br />So so so amazingly, he says <br /><br />&quot;Sure of course &quot; etc, &quot;THAT HAPPEND TO ME WHEN I WAS A KID TOO&quot; lol lol i couldnt believe he said this. So he lets me in, completely dirty and muddy , tripping balls, and I get on his phone, which I PRETEND to dial, and sit there and am like &#039;oh well my mom isn&#039;t answering, I&#039;ll just walk home&#039; and he says &#039;where do you live?&#039; and I say ________ and he hasn&#039;t even heard of it bc we&#039;re far away (gave him a major road name). He says dont worry I&#039;ll drive you home. I didn&#039;t speak 1 word to him on the ride home, just stared out the window tripping my ass off. Then when we got to my neighborhood, like a hour + drive, i knew he&#039;d try to talk to my parents so I told him the wrong house to drop me off at, which was actually behind my house on a different street. I got out of the car and as he is like &#039;dont you think i should talk to your parents blah blah &#039; i just walk behind the house, jump the fence, jump my fence, and come into my backyard an into my house. I tripped until 8 am watching Bevis and Butthead and drawing in a sketchbook. It was awesome after i got home. <br /><br />My friends however, apparently looked for me all night, driving around in the bronco, tripping balls, until they gave up and just parked somewhere and listened to music. They all thought I couldve been dead or whatever. They said it sucked. <br /><br /><br />ok that took me about a half hour to write lol but im drunk an zanied so it was fun... hope u liked it..

				I&#039;m debating on whether or not this is a good experience. I met a woman off Craigslist last year. I posted an ad for cuddling, and she was pretty attractive. We cuddled, and she went on her way. We hung out the next day and I happened to have some Xanax and Klonopin, and very little experience with both. I&#039;d say we had a massive benzo overdose. All I could recall are blurs and a tattoo she had on her stomach.<br /><br />I awoke the next morning, naked, dick stuck to the carpet, as if I were crawling toward something, with the headache feeling that can only accompany a blackout, or being hit with a bag full of hammers. I was alone, frightened and confused. My wallet was missing, and an episode of Weeds was looping on the television. Was I raped? Did a woman drug me, and have some lumberjack fuck me in the ass and rob me or something? <br /><br />I scrambled to my feet, got dressed and grabbed my gun. Around this time I had noticed I was missing two Viagra and half a bottle of Xanax. I was searching the house for invisible ninjas and inspecting the integrity of my butthole, when I decided to check outside for signs of a struggle, or a clue of some sort. There I happened upon the woman, asleep in her car with her pants on backwards in the July heat. I knocked on her car window and re-introduced myself. <br /><br />We went inside and started piecing together the nights events, like a scene from the Hangover. She said she felt as if she was repeatedly punched in the vagina, so I came forward and stated we likely had Xanax and Viagra sex all night and she left me to my own devices, naked and sticky, with the door open for anyone to stumble across me. I then said, &quot;since we definitely had sex, and don&#039;t remember it, we should have sex now so we DO remember it.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how that worked, but we were inseparable for a few months after that. In those following months I realized that she was indeed a whore, and a piece of shit. I found her on a few dating sites and she had an estranged husband at the time. She up and left one day and I haven&#039;t heard from her since. I&#039;m a bit cynical about it, but I take solace in knowing she is just a run of the mill Craigslist whore and a wreck of a woman, and she isn&#039;t worth my time or emotional attachment. After six months and not committing to a relationship I didn&#039;t attempt to get her back. I&#039;ve been single ever since. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get a girlfriend off Craigslist.

				my first saliva trip!!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i was a freshman in college, and had just started smoking marijuana for the first few times. Couple weeks later, my roommate starts talking about this drug called saliva. I ignored him at first, but grew interested over time. About a month goes by before he can actually convince me to try it. I would ask him what does it do to you, he&#039;s like, man it makes you feel good man it makes you feel good, and it hits you really fast, but it doesn&#039;t last long. So as I said I finally decided to take a hit of this &quot;stuff&quot; he calls saliva.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hit it one really hard time, and looked back up and said i thought this stuff worked fast. Took another huge hit. Before I could remove the bowl from my lips our dorm room instantly turn into zebra print wall paper! Im still telling him that Idon&#039;t feel it, but at the same time looking for a place to sit down in my own room. As soon as i sit down I hop back up and get EXTREMELY angry with my roommate. I truthfully don&#039;t know why, but i started yelling crazy shit at him, and ended up chasing him down the hall of our dorm. We lived o the second floor so once we made it to the balcony I instantly burst into laughter!!! Another friend had joined use while we were on the balcony, and my roommate was telling him that i was tripping. I instantly go back to being angry, and started asking them why they were talking about me behind my back! While they&#039;re both trying to calm me down they literally look like little tornadoes in front of me! While all three of us we on the balcony, I look down and see the campus police car, and i automatically thought he was about to come up and get me! I sprint back to my dorm kick my shoes off, and at that time we had community bathrooms, and go down the hall jump in the shower with every bit of my clothes on! this is probably fifteen minutes into my trip so I almost automatically snap out of it, and begin to look at myself like an idiot because I am in the shower with all my clothes on.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I make it back to my dorm room embarrassed, and prepared for what my roommate had to say, but he was honestly scared from when I grew angry at him in the first few minutes of my trip. I could not control myself when the saliva finally kicked in, which i did not like at all, but I did have a pretty wold time when I tried it. Months later, after becoming a more experience smoker, I found that putting saliva in a hooka is the correct way to smoke it, so my trip may not have been so bad if I had done it the proper way. But over all the rage was kind of a scare for me too, haha, so I decided that was my first and last time.

I&#039;ve done paper tabs and cubes multiple times after first doing the liquid, and taking even 6-7 tabs did not even come close to 1 drop of the liquid. I had never tripped before on anything, and the only drugs I&#039;d done prior were weed and some pharmys. <br /><br />About 5-6pm a normal saturday in November i believe, me and a group of about 10 friends are downtown having a jolly ol time when we come across our buddy &#039;TJ&#039; who lives right in that area. He is probably the scummiest kid in our grade but he is cool. He pulls out a Visine bottle and tells us it&#039;s acid. Next thing I know everyone is taking a drop. We&#039;ve got like 4 girls (think lacrosse team captain type girls) with us and even they do it. I&#039;m like whatever so I take a drop, and he tells us that they are goign to be camping out in the woods later and we should come along. We are freshman in highschool btw. <br /><br />We depart, im in my friends old bronco II (balla) and we dont feel anything for a long time. It&#039;s like over an hour so I&#039;m just like whatever this sh*t is garbage. We start to head out to the &#039;campground&#039; to meet up with the other kids, like 20 in all, we are meeting the pot-head-druggie group of kids that we know but arent tight with. They are infamous in our school for all kinds of sex parties and tripping at school etc. Actually one of them, my boy, was murdered in 2003 but that is another story<br /><br />we park the bronco on some side road and we are so far out into the countryside that I have no idea where we are. We drove over an hour to get to this spot , and there are just farms and woods, nothing else. <br /><br />While we are walking to the camp ground, theres like 20 ppl and they are all like &#039;damn i am tripping my ass off!!&#039; . I am feeling nothing... but after about 10 more minutes, <br /><br />BAM<br /><br />The **** hit me like a 100mph brick wall. I went from 100% sober to 100% ****ing tripping my ass off insanity. And this is was NOT an easy hike to our campground at all. We had to jump rocks across a large creek, we had to pass through multiple barbed wire fences and electric fences that were for cattle, and then there was this CLIFF, that we had to walk up, like a 45 degree grade where if you fell off you&#039;d fall 15 feet into the creek. So we finally get to the campsite , which is on a farmer&#039;s land that we do not know at all, but TJ says it&#039;s cool and they&#039;ve camped there before. <br /><br />At this point, I am completely out of my mind. I am seeing indian spirits in the fire (it is dark now) , and we are sitting in a circle around the fire, drinking beer and smoking pot. There ar elike 5 guys there that I&#039;ve never met before, redneck dudes that trailblazed our path there that knew TJ or something. <br /><br />I thought they were all cops. Like 100% thought they were police. I remember just staring into the fire looking at all the indian spirit&#039;s faces and thinking about how this is their land, how we are white infidels on their stolen land, and how they suffered. I also thought that in the darkness around us, all of our parents were there. I could see tons of faces in the darkness , hundreds of faces, men and women, and I thought that they were all our parents, and that my parents were out there also. It was really freaky feeling like my parents were watching me here with these kids. I knew that this was some kind of &#039;test&#039;. They were testing us right now, to see who of us would go to heaven, and who of us would go to hell. <br /><br />during all of this, everyone is talking about this hurricane that is supposed to be coming, and that we are going to be hit by a hurricane. it started to rain lightly.<br /><br />We were sitting in two main circles, with two fires. I&#039;ll try to keep this simple, but basically I knew in my mind, that I had to move around the circles (think figure 8 style) and exit the circles in order to go to heaven and not be trapped with them in hell. So I stood up and slowly moved one place at a time until I eventually was towards the &#039;exit&#039; (the way we came). Somebody noticed that I was bugging out, and they were like &#039;hey what are you doing?&#039; and I said something to the extent of &#039;I am not going to hell with you guys. I&#039;m going to go to heaven!&#039; and I started to leave (walk back). <br /><br />They r like where are you going? and I said I&#039;m walking home, which was impossible because we were so far away. They all started freaking out saying that I was going to get them caught and they couldnt let me go. One of the redneck kids tried to physically keep me there (they decided it would be bes to knock me out) , and I wrestled this dude (i was probably 125 lbs at the time ) who was much much bigger then me until i escaped , probably a good 5 minute wrestling match which involved some punches exchanged. Eventually they said fine, let him go, and I left. <br /><br />Thus began my journey. <br /><br />I returned to them. I couldnt tell you why except for the same reason that a moth goes towards a light. I kept walking back to the fire, and every time they&#039;d be like &#039;hey he&#039;s back!&#039; and I&#039;d be like &#039;DAMMIT! I didnt mean to come back&#039; , and leave again. <br /><br />I was so determined that I&#039;d get home, it was like I was Jesus on a mission to save mankind. A lot of **** happened on the way back but I&#039;ll just keep to the biggest stuff-- <br /><br />1. I walked straight through the creek without a second thought about how to get over it. It was ****in cold but that didnt phase me at all. <br />2. I came to the electric fence... and when I was going to go through it (only top wire is active), i had this crazy feeling in my body. I couldnt figure otu what it was , it must have taken me 5 minutes to figure it out. I was holding the top wire. I finally let it go and was like wtf , and went through the fence.<br />3. I spooked a circle of horses, black horses, and they were running in a circle. This was the craziest ****in thing i&#039;ve ever seen or done probably, instead of walking around them, for whatever reason, I only understood to walk through them. I timed my walk so that I walked through the circle without being trampled. (my friends later claimed these were cows but to this day i swear they were horses) <br /><br />After about a mile or so through other treacherous terain, I finally got to the road. It was one of the most triumphant moments of my life. Looking back over the field, the horses, everything, was so beautiful. The rain was hitting the electic fences and little sparks were coming off. Everything was purplish from the moon.. i cant describe this scene but it was so amazing i stood there at least 15 minutes just looking. Then i walked down the road, wet up to my torso, starting my walk home. I had no idea where I was going. When I got to the first house, I decided I&#039;d take a rest. It is like 12PM now (this timeline is a bit ****ed up but it was bout midnight when i got to the house), I decide to sit down in the middle of this guys yard, in a shadow of a tree being cast from his porch light, so that i wouldnt be seen. <br /><br />the very SECOND that I sit down in the shadow, a car pulls into his driveway. The man gets out of his car and walks up to his front door, and I get up and walk up to the man and out of nowhere hatch an elaborate scheme. I say <br /><br />&quot;Excuse me sir, do you mind if I come in and use your phone? My friends told me that we were going camping, and then they ditched me in the woods.&quot; -- I also was speaking in a NY accent (no idea why) , and I had absolutely no intention of actually using his phone. Total scam. <br /><br />So so so amazingly, he says <br /><br />&quot;Sure of course &quot; etc, &quot;THAT HAPPEND TO ME WHEN I WAS A KID TOO&quot; lol lol i couldnt believe he said this. So he lets me in, completely dirty and muddy , tripping balls, and I get on his phone, which I PRETEND to dial, and sit there and am like &#039;oh well my mom isn&#039;t answering, I&#039;ll just walk home&#039; and he says &#039;where do you live?&#039; and I say ________ and he hasn&#039;t even heard of it bc we&#039;re far away (gave him a major road name). He says dont worry I&#039;ll drive you home. I didn&#039;t speak 1 word to him on the ride home, just stared out the window tripping my ass off. Then when we got to my neighborhood, like a hour + drive, i knew he&#039;d try to talk to my parents so I told him the wrong house to drop me off at, which was actually behind my house on a different street. I got out of the car and as he is like &#039;dont you think i should talk to your parents blah blah &#039; i just walk behind the house, jump the fence, jump my fence, and come into my backyard an into my house. I tripped until 8 am watching Bevis and Butthead and drawing in a sketchbook. It was awesome after i got home. <br /><br />My friends however, apparently looked for me all night, driving around in the bronco, tripping balls, until they gave up and just parked somewhere and listened to music. They all thought I couldve been dead or whatever. They said it sucked. <br /><br /><br />ok that took me about a half hour to write lol but im drunk an zanied so it was fun... hope u liked it..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is honestly a short novel.

				here is my story. no plot, no characters, no fuckin around :)<br />Deep Meditation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this place between insanity and the colors I once saw, there is no forgiveness. There is not even a past to forgive. There is only a now to survive, and if you stumble and fall, it is an upside-down world that you now see. This is the story of what happened to me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me by surprise, but I was as ready for it as I could ever be. I was ready for the last moment of my life. In that precise moment before my former life ended, colors as vibrant as the plumes upon a peacocks tail and as elusive as the tenth color hidden below and above a rainbow in the rain transgressed through the ground and the walls. The colors touched my sight beautifully. As a mother tending to her child before he takes a step off the edge towards insanity, the colors took me up by my soul and told me that they were not here to stay. It was their time to say goodbye, in the way that colors can say goodbye. I stood peering at the torrential hurricane through my blinded light of reason, and then the stone walls that surrounded me lifted off into the violent temperament of the storm.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say those who dare it without being prepared are separated to pieces by a powerful thrashing energy, left behind (or perhaps under, or over, no one can say) where all resistance is hopelessly lost. I moved with the moment, chancing for another step after the last, knowing that the path ahead of me lay not flat and steady, but shaken and distorted. A thrashing energy threatening to destroy me strikes out at each step, challenging me and taunting me. My mind struggles to place the wavering path in front of itself, hoping not to lose balance at each footfall.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm air surrounded me in a moment, that moment lasting an eternity long. It split itself into three. My legs felt the air first, loosening themselves from the ground and kicking up. I find myself looking up at my ankles. They were never so fine before, with the colors behind them showering and pouring love that drips from my toes and descends to my chest. This is the second impossibility in the moment. I touch the drops on my chest with my hands, and they too feel the love that comes with the rain. The love that shines forth from beyond the colors, and the love that overbears the spirit with a fantastic question. The question is the third part of this impossible moment. I find that my hands have floated away, that they are in my head grasping at this question.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see my hands tearing at it, shredding away strands of colors to find more. More love lay hidden, my hands are sure of it. What is it that I love? It is a love so fine it stands unopposed in a hurricane of emotions so strong yet so incomparable to anything outside my mind. My existential hands change colors, and my real hands have been lost along the path I tripped upside-down on. And then I close my eyes and my mind is blank. Suddenly I see a gem of perfect quality, and with it, a thousand more. They gloss the inside of my eyelids like a wonderful blanket reflecting the light coming from the inside of my head. My hands change colors once again, and are seen backwards through the mirror created by these gems. The colors torn away by these hands bounce in many directions, combining and tearing apart into countless combinations of graceful horrors and terrible beauty.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suddenly realize a path appearing within the fantastic visions I see. The path lay flat and steady ahead of me, guiding me to it like a light in the night. The night surrounded me in colors and sights that I must face with equal force to peer at. I walk along the path my mind leads me up, feeling a gradual increase. I feel more comfortable with my vision, and I turn left and right to see that the vivid monstrosities of beauty and terror are almost behind me now and almost below me too. I see the tops of them and I note that there are waterfalls coming from their steep edges. The water flows over me, and into the path I am walking. It rushes me forward, taking time and ticking it forward quickly. The day comes quickly too, and the sun, knowing not of time, shines forth through my eyelids and illuminates the present only, leaving what I saw in the past behind and blinding perfectly my vision of a future to be. I see that I am hopelessly in a present moment, with times before and after lost to the sun. I feel the path in my mind unfolding, and expanding. My mind comes to focus, because it is here, in this present moment that it is needed.<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&quot;It was their time to say goodbye, in the way that colors can say goodbye&quot; .... I think I&#039;m going to take this compilation of anecdotes in a different direction....<br />I was in my mid- twenties and in a fairly drunken space between heroin addictions. I had just attempted to make a fresh start and moved into a bedsit( single room apartment) on the top floor of an old house. The landlord and landlady were a nice old couple who had bought the property and converted most of it into flats to support them in their retirement.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was my first night there. I decided to head out. I went to few pubs and then a nightclub and became incredibly drunk. As far as I am aware no drugs were consumed; I&nbsp; have little recollection of the night.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Presumably after a fruitless search for a willing woman the pizza bell went off in my head ( this bell rings at a certain stage of drunkenness and causes you to go on autopilot to the pizza/kebab shop and so to bed)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I stumbled home and staggered up the stairs into my new home. I pulled off my clothes and fell into bed naked, forgetting about pizza for now. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some time later I awoke with a full bladder. I got up to go to the toilet which was outside my flat down a flight of stairs. I think I was partially sleepwalking at this point. I didn&#039;t put on any clothes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I didn&#039;t realise was that my apartment door was spring loaded and locked shut behind me. When I returned&nbsp; was stuck on the wrong side, naked and pizza less.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My memory stutters at this point. I remember deciding to kick the door open.....................<br /><br />.............I woke up the next morning feeling very unwell, curled up in the doorway on the landing. Still naked, but someone had thrown a really thick warm fur lined army jacket over me. A great sense of foreboding rose within me. I&nbsp; crept downstairs and got the landlord to let me in to my flat. He did so cursing and shaking his head in disgust. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I ate some of the pizza and huddled under the bedclothes shaking. <br /><br />A short time later the landlord returned to fix my door( I had damaged it kicking it). He was furious . &quot; Do you have some kind of mental problem? Are you on medication ?&quot; . He glared at me through his thick round glasses. He was short bald angry and confused.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It turned out that after being unable to burst open my door, I had got confused and turned round. I had begun kicking my neighbours door ( a retired doctor) with more success. In the middle of the night I had kicked his door in and stormed in naked, standing befuddled in front of him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Presumably his medical training helped him to guide me back out onto the landing. It was his heavy coat that covered me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I never really felt comfortable in the flat afterwards. I managed to never see the ex doctor again, by listening out for his door and avoiding him in the corridor. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I kept the coat.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In another drunken interlude between H addiction, I had got a job at a bar/ restaurant/ pool hall. I had been working&nbsp; there a week when I persuaded the boss to give me an advance on my wages.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t remember much about the night except juggling with limes behind bar, and later, and old man having me in a headlock.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day I went into work feeling shame. The boss met me with an envelope containing the remainder of my wages. He shook his head sadly. &quot; disgraceful behaviour&quot; was all he would say.<br /><br />I still don&#039;t know what happened that night.

I met a woman off Craigslist last year. I posted an ad for cuddling, and she was pretty attractive. We cuddled, and she went on her way. We hung out the next day and I happened to have some Xanax and Klonopin, and very little experience with both. I&#039;d say we had a massive benzo overdose. All I could recall are blurs and a tattoo she had on her stomach.<br /><br />I awoke the next morning, naked, dick stuck to the carpet, as if I were crawling toward something, with the headache feeling that can only accompany a blackout, or being hit with a bag full of hammers. I was alone, frightened and confused. My wallet was missing, and an episode of Weeds was looping on the television. Was I raped? Did a woman drug me, and have some lumberjack fuck me in the ass and rob me or something? <br /><br />I scrambled to my feet, got dressed and grabbed my gun. Around this time I had noticed I was missing two Viagra and half a bottle of Xanax. I was searching the house for invisible ninjas and inspecting the integrity of my butthole, when I decided to check outside for signs of a struggle, or a clue of some sort. There I happened upon the woman, asleep in her car with her pants on backwards in the July heat. I knocked on her car window and re-introduced myself. <br /><br />We went inside and started piecing together the nights events, like a scene from the Hangover. She said she felt as if she was repeatedly punched in the vagina, so I came forward and stated we likely had Xanax and Viagra sex all night and she left me to my own devices, naked and sticky, with the door open for anyone to stumble across me. I then said, &quot;since we definitely had sex, and don&#039;t remember it, we should have sex now so we DO remember it.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how that worked, but we were inseparable for a few months after that. In those following months I realized that she was indeed a whore, and a piece of shit. I found her on a few dating sites and she had an estranged husband at the time. She up and left one day and I haven&#039;t heard from her since. I&#039;m a bit cynical about it, but I take solace in knowing she is just a run of the mill Craigslist whore and a wreck of a woman, and she isn&#039;t worth my time or emotional attachment. After six months and not committing to a relationship I didn&#039;t attempt to get her back. I&#039;ve been single ever since. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get a girlfriend off Craigslist.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />wtf? Now that&#039;s the most fucked up story I have ever heard in a long time.

				Yeah it was a bit bleak. I&#039;ve got a hand full of similar stories; blacked out, fucked the girl I liked&#039;s best friend, ruined that opportunity. Fucked four Craigslist women in one week, once while in a jacuzzi while wearing a cowboy hat. If you&#039;re a decent writer you&#039;ll get some Craigslist replies. I used to get fan mail and everything.

				I saw that too. How the fuck did he write such a rambling pile of nonsense in eight minutes immediately after the original post? That must have been copied from somewhere or homie saw the original post and can type faster than a secretary. He said it took a half hour to write and it was a span of 8-12 minutes between post and edit. <br /><br />I declare shenanigans. <br />Boo this thread. <br /><br />Half of monkeywrench&#039;s posts are him asking for money in all caps. <br /><br />Boo this thread, monkeywrench and the OP.

				Dude looking through monkeywrench&#039;s posts is ridiculous. I&#039;ve got a marijuana donation fund because I got ripped off but monkeywrench spammed up the boards and probably scammed a few bitcoins. <br /><br />Don&#039;t give that fucker a bitcoin. Don&#039;t even give me a bitcoin because I&#039;m an asshole. Give it to someone who has a grasp for grammar and can write a decent story as the thread asked for such attributes.

				So one day I got fucked up on xanax, roxies, weed, and then I went for a drive. I ended up at the gas station and while I was there I bought several quarts of beer. I left with plans 2 visit a girl I knew. While driving I got more fucked up each minute. Eventually I was completely hammered and I went on some back roads. I started thinking about grand theft auto and before I knew it I started driving like I was in grand theft auto. I started running stop signs, stop lights, speeding, and just driving as crazy as I could. <br /><br />Then I ran another stop sign and as I ran it I turned left, I turned left really hard because I was going fairly fast. At this point a police officer observed me and he turned on his lights and started following me in hopes that I would pull over. I didnt want to pull over right away because I had been drinking the beer I bought from the gas station. By the time the cop got behind me I had drank all the beer but the empty bottles were on my passenger seat. So I figured I would throw them out the window and then pull over and deny that I was ever drinking. <br /><br />So, I opened my sun roof and began throwing the empty glass beer bottles out of my sunroof. I was so fucked up that I didnt realize I was throwing the beer bottles directly in the path of the police car. The cop said he had to swerve to avoid his car being directly hit several times. <br /><br />Finally,&nbsp; I had thrown all the beer bottles out of my truck so I decieded I would pull over. I went to pull over in someones yard. I didnt notice but they had a brick wall that was about 3 feet tall. I ran directly into the wall, I knocked alot of it down but after I hit the wall I forgot that a cop was behind me so I thought to myself &quot;i better get the fuck outta here before I get caught for running over this wall.&quot;<br /><br />I didnt realize but the cop that had been following me was directly behind me after I hit the wall. I didnt even look and I put it in reverse and started backing up, luckily the cop saw me and he backed up right away so I didnt hit him. Then I started driving on the back road I was next to as if nothing had happened. It was at this point I noticed a cop behind me with his lights on. So I pulled over, I dont remember exactly what he said but in the police report it said that he confronted me about driving drunk, hitting the wall, and throwing the beer bottles directly into the path of his car while he was following me. In the report he writes that he asked me about these things and I responded back saying &quot;How do you know it was me? There is no truck in my bottles.&quot;<br /><br />The cop ended up arresting me for a few things including DUI and he gave me 6 tickets.<br /><br />Now to wrap up this funny story with the funniest part, I was hammered drunk and I deserved most of the charges but the police officer lied about how long he was driving behind me and when my lawyer obtained his GPS records it was easy to establish that the police officer was lying about multiple things including my speed, his speed, and the distance he had been following me. So all the charges got dropped and all I ended up getting were the tickets for driving infractions.

				That guy made around 20 posts about soliciting bitcoins for loans and hasn&#039;t been seen since. He himself stated it took over a half hour to write his post and it was completed in eight minutes after the original post, which is insanity considering I don&#039;t even read posts that fast after they&#039;re first written. It just doesn&#039;t seem logical that he wrote that, I for one took about 15 minutes on my story. <br /><br />Just on principle monkeywrench seems to be a scammer and I don&#039;t think he deserves a thing. Read his posts.

I find it interesting and convenient that you were in the middle of your post in another thread, decided to check the forum in the middle of your rant, found a thread that your story could be posted in while remaining in the context of gaining money from the forum, saw it immediately after it was created, and happened to finish it within seconds of seeing the thread.<br /><br />Call me cynical but I smell bullshit.

				<br />Not my story, but THE funniest drugs story I ever read.....<br /><br /><br />This one time in college, a few friends and I were in the courtyard of a bar on Decatur St. in New Orleans. We had these rolls to do. During this period in New Orleans there were these rolls that people called chocolate-chip cookies because they were white with little brown specks. They came on really strong at first and it felt like it was heavy dope or something but then it would ease up and you’d be able to move and talk and maybe dance and have the time of your life whenever, wherever you wanted. I remember people saying that the brown specks in the rolls were “heroin spots” and that sounded pretty cool at the time because none of us knew how awesome (horrible) heroin actually is (can turn out to be). We all ate the rolls, and about twenty minutes later my friend Dan (who had also just eaten a gigantic platter of ribs and fries and coleslaw and potato salad that looked disgusting and I don’t even know why he ate a bunch of food when he was getting ready to do ecstasy because that doesn’t really mix very well), he said his stomach didn’t feel good. Then he grew a little white. But Dan was already really white so he turned more of a grayish-green color like pale people (gross) always do. His hue was quickly waning. Dan had long black stringy hair and a gigantic mouth that was always smiling and laughing but it also took up most of his face because it was so big. You know those people whose faces are all mouth. Dan’s color and sickened demeanor made it obvious what was coming. He leaned forward in his chair with his head under the table and treated us to the sound of retching and little smacklets of undigested rib bites hitting the floor of the courtyard. Obviously we wanted to leave immediately, but we stayed so as to not attract attention to the mess he was making. He was our friend and he was temporarily down. He had his head under the table for a minute. When the sound of the vomiting stopped, it was replaced by a sound even more awful. A moaning sound, but not a moaning.&nbsp; Or a muffled voice but not really muffled. It sounded like Dan was talking with his hand over his mouth, but he wasn’t.<br /><br />“Dan, you okay?”<br /><br />“aaanhaaaanhaanha”<br /><br />“Dan, you alright?”<br /><br />“aahnaaahnaaa”<br /><br />“Dan, sit back up. People are watching.”<br /><br />Dan sat up. When he sat up he looked around at all of us with his mouth wide open like you do at the dentist’s. It was wider than just open. It was like double-open. I thought he was maybe laughing.<br /><br />“Dan, what are you doing? Shut your mouth.”<br /><br />“aaaaahnaa” Dan pointed to his jaw.<br /><br />“Oh shit.”<br /><br />There was a tremendous boom of laughter.<br /><br />While Dan was under the table, the vomiting became so violent that it forced his mouth open and it got stuck. His jaw was locked into the wide-as-fuck-open position and there was no budging it. It looked more open than you think mouths are ever supposed to get, and it looked incredibly painful. He didn’t say it was painful. Dan could no longer speak, only moan. You need to be able to close your mouth or get it somewhere near closed in order to form words with your lips. You need to be able to touch your tongue to the back of your teeth or the roof of your mouth because that’s where language is. Besides it being pretty funny, the sound Dan made when trying to speak was unpleasant, disquieting, and terrible and I’m pretty sure everyone wanted to get away from it because it had the potential of giving us all a bad night. I’m not sure where you are right now while you’re reading this or if you are in the position to do this without embarrassing yourself, but when you get a chance, open your mouth as wide as you can and the try to say in a normal volume speaking voice, “O how life is strange and changeful.” Try it. Sounds fucked up, right? It sounds like something is seriously wrong with you, right?<br /><br />By this point, we are all starting to feel our cookies. Dan was feeling it as well. He was sitting up in his chair now and his eyes were rolling back in his head and he kept trying to talk. But it wasn’t talk. It sounded awful, like that sound you just made when you tried to say, “O how life is strange and changeful,” with your mouth all jacked open like a palsy. It was not a conducive soundtrack for a night meant for pleasure and nice things.<br /><br />“You have to go to the hospital.”<br /><br />Dan shook his head.<br /><br />“We should call an ambulance.”<br /><br />Dan shook his head and his eyes rolled around and even though his mouth was open wide enough for me to put my fucking head in there, I could still recognize a smile on his face. The giant circle would widen when he smiled. It looked like his face was going to tear open at the corners of his mouth.<br /><br />“Okay then. Fuck it. He doesn’t want to go. Let’s just go to another bar,” somebody (not me) said.<br /><br />We left the courtyard bar walking in a small pack down Decatur and Dan kept trying to say things. He was rubbing his hands all over his body and hanging his head back as he walked and he kept making those terrible sounds. It started to look and sound vaguely sexual (in a totally scary, creepy way) and it was becoming increasingly annoying. We walked into the next bar: four normal looking college students with their insane-looking friend whose mouth was jacked open all the way like he was really amazed at the bar we had just walked into. Everyone was staring at Dan. Dan was nodding his head to the music like nothing was wrong. He put quarters in the pool table and went around the bar asking people if they wanted to shoot a game. But he couldn’t ask them anything. He just walked up to them and made that horrible sound with his mouth wide open and it probably looked like to them that he was trying to bite them. No one wanted to shoot. Dan refused to leave or go to the hospital. At one point he borrowed a pen and grabbed a napkin from the bar and wrote: I feel great. I don’t care about my face. As proud as I was of him for that winning fuck-all attitude, the sound was just too much for me and I didn’t understand why he kept trying to talk when no one could understand him. My buzz was pretty much killed so I went home.<br /><br />The next morning Dan showed up at my place. He said he stayed out last night for another hour or so. At one point he wanted to smoke some pot to help kick in the roll a bit but he couldn’t hit a bowl or a joint because he couldn’t get his lips around it. Instead, they stopped by someone’s house who had a bong and he had to stick the entire top of the bong inside his mouth and behind his teeth to get a hit. I asked him why he didn’t just have someone blow smoke into his mouth. He hadn’t thought of that. He said when he woke up that morning his jaw was still locked open. (Did I mention that Dan rode a scooter?) He said he rode his scooter to the hospital with his mouth still like that. He said he freaked out a lot of drivers and he also ate lots of things from the air like bugs. At the hospital, the doctors gave him a shot in the jaw and closed it for him. As soon as he got home from the hospital, it popped open again. He had to ride his scooter back to the hospital with his mouth still jacked wide open and have them redo it. The doctors wrapped a bandage around his head so it wouldn’t happen again.
