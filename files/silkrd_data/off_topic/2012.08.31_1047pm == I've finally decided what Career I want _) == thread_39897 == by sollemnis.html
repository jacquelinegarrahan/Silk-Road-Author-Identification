				I&#039;m still going to give it a try - I&#039;ve got nothing to lose. Going to give it a bash whilst I&#039;m still young. Not too sure how I&#039;m going to pay for College though - Should have attended when I was young enough to get free education.

				You can always pray to me if you need help.&nbsp; Just say &quot;Dear real god that is on the silk road forums, please help me&quot; and then I may or may not help depending on whether you&#039;re stupid enough to think I helped or not.&nbsp; And no jesus was not my son he was just a dumb fuck with a personality disorder.&nbsp; Believe it or not he had waaay too much time on his hands and wrote an entire book about himself.

Sounds like you&#039;re doing exactly what you love! Yes, we need more people who support the idea of taking drugs. I mean for fuck sake, I watch people drink Coffee, Alcohol and smoke fags, yet judge drug users. Erhmm...??? Whats Caffeine and Nicotine then? <br /><br />A LOT of people drink Alcohol and judge people who take drugs... Alcohol is still something people consume to get an effect. Just like someone snorting a line of Coke, there&#039;s no difference. Not that I&#039;m against Alcohol (Had a few myself tonight). <br /><br />Exercise gives people a buzz, as it causes the brain to release Endorphins, that can be an addiction. Food can be a drug, good food stimulates our pleasure system, just like being in love with someone. So yes, relationships, sex, exercise and food etc can all be addictive. <br /><br />Life is addictive, rant over&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />

				I have a strong interest in pharmacology because of my drug curiosity since I was younger. I would be interested in the pharmacology field, but I chose it more of a hobby to study. I say go for it! I personally don&#039;t trust myself working everyday with opiates and dexedrine haha, that would seriously be a hindrance to my choice of studying pharmacology or any professional medical career.<br /><br />Best of luck!

				I know someone who did Pharmacy Schooling and he said it is a bitch.&nbsp; 4 years of undergrad, then a 4 years of pharmacy school.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t something you just go and decide to do.&nbsp; but it is a job that should continue to grow in demand as people live longer and require peels.

				weed and other erbs you can use without having to throw in a bunch of man made shit and synthesis are the only medicine that the creator intended for us. Don&#039;t get me wrong tho I like the shit out of them pills but to hell with that alcohol and benzos.&nbsp; If I have a benzo then I have a dolar or two you know?<br /><br />It&#039;s still a good time for more schooling. If you got kids then you can get the most financial aid but you can still get aid without kids. I got one and I was getting like 1800 every three months. No that dont pay all the home bills but it helped plus I got certified for something else

				Just keep your record clean, I was charged with a felony that i plead no contest to when i was 18, and have a masters in biotechnology,&nbsp; i wanted to go to med school since i was 15, even with a 35 on my mcats and already having a masters i cant find a damn school to accept me into there med school over a felony charge, not even a conviction. I was offered a half ride scholarship to university of Australia&#039;s school of medicine last year but haven&#039;t accepted it because its on the opposite side of the world, and I couldn&#039;t just drop everything. <br /><br />
