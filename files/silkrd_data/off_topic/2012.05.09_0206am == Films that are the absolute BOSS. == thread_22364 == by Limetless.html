				Rise of the Footsoldier IS good yeah, but it doesn&#039;t inspire me career-wise. Layer Cake is where you want to end up.<br /><br />Plus on top of that Michael Gambon&#039;s speech in it is fucking epic. <br /><br />&quot;You&#039;re born, you take shit. You get out in the world, you take more shit. Climb a little higher, take less shit. Until you&#039;re in that rarefied atmosphere where you have forgotten what shit even looks like....welcome to the Layer Cake son.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s the best &quot;film speech&quot; in history IMO. The book it&#039;s based on is really good as well.

				Hi there,i have something to add,but many good films are already listed.<br /><br />Mad Men is a really good series too.<br /><br />The most authentic drug movie i have ever seen is the Pusher Triology,it takes part in Kopenhagen and is direct by Nicolas Winding Refn ( you maybe know Drive from him).<br />You may also know one actor,Mads Mikkelsen he played in Casino Royale.<br /><br />Overall this is my hottest tip on drug related movies,watch it yourself and build your opinion

				Donnie Darko<br />Crazy dark movie, I&#039;ve always loved it.<br /><br />A Scanner Darkly <br />Not a great movie per say, but everyone should watch it. It looks like they filmed the movie with some big stars (keanu reaves, robert downey jr, woody harrelson, winona ryder) then converted it to vector graphics. It&#039;s about the future when most of the world is addicted to drugs and cops undercover have to wear chameleon like suits to hide their identity from even their superiors.<br /><br />The Big Lebowski<br />Classic.<br /><br />Shawshank Redemption<br />Classic.<br /><br />This thread is full of crime movies, I think my favorite crime movie is Casino, can&#039;t think of many that truly standout, maybe Alpha Dog, that one was pretty good. Godfather and Scarface are obviously the most popular.

You get out in the world, you take more shit. Climb a little higher, take less shit. Until you&#039;re in that rarefied atmosphere where you have forgotten what shit even looks like....welcome to the Layer Cake son.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s the best &quot;film speech&quot; in history IMO. The book it&#039;s based on is really good as well.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Layer Cake was pimp. You forgot to include Daniel Craig&#039;s money line in the film:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine.&quot;<br /><br />In fact, it was Craig&#039;s badass performance in Layer Cake that landed him the Bond role.<br /><br />Craig gets to play out the fantasy of every ambitious baller on the planet who dreams of the day they can graduate from the game after washing and smartly investing a large enough chunk of change to maintain legitimacy. Probably 95% don&#039;t have what it takes to quit and stay away, but Daniel Craig&#039;s character, despite the constant temptation to break his golden rules that probably everyone here is implicitly familiarity with, proves himself to be anything but just an ordinary playa. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah that is a boss line. <br /><br />And yeah you are dead right. Fuck it, it&#039;s my ambition and it&#039;s not even cheesy to admit it because really that&#039;s what everyone wants. <br /><br />Another one of the best lines in it is - &quot;My name? If you knew that, you&#039;d be as smart as I am.&quot;

				My favorite high/stoned movie was the Planet Earth series. One of the few box sets I&#039;ve ever purchased, and well worth it. I was incredibly high when I saw the jungle one about the spores that would grow out of insects bodies and brains.

The Kill Bills are also a given. And a third installment has been confirmed as well! :D I would have to say his most underrated is Jackie Brown, I think since it came right after Pulp Fiction and was focused more on character development than violence. Definitely a must-see. Oh and True Romance, which Tarantino wrote. Great movie!

Kill Bill I still don&#039;t understand how anyone even liked those movies, let alone the cult following it generated. And Super Ex-Girlfriend is on my worst movies ever list.

				Without a doubt &#039;From Dusk till Dawn&#039; is the most fucked up film Ive watched stoned.&nbsp; Knew nothing about it before I&#039;d watched it so when the change comes halfway through was completely unexpected (not gonna say just in case I spoil for anyone who hasnt saw it), was convinced someone had switched tapes.<br /><br />Everyone is putting up Layer Cake, but surprised Sexy Beast getting no mentions - Ben Kingsley amazing in it, some change for the man who played Ghandhi.<br /><br />I dont really have a fav genre with films - they are a bit like music, either good or bad, no inbetween.&nbsp; So heres a few of my favs:-<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street 1, 3 (Dream warriors) &amp; 4 (Dream Master)<br />Boogie Nights<br />Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox story<br />Halloween (original)<br />Theres something About mary<br />As Good As it Gets<br />The Shawshank Redemption<br />The Thing (original)<br />Dodgeball<br />Goodfellas<br />Heat<br />Carlitos Way<br />Forgetting Sarah marshall<br />Gladiator<br />LA Confidential<br />Trainspotting<br />Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil<br />The Dark Knight<br />Iron Man 1<br />Thor<br />Bad taste<br />Black Sheep<br /><br /><br />

				Platoon is ranked pretty high on my war movie list. The number of big names stars in that movie or that came from that movie is ridiculous (Charlie Sheen of course but a young Johnny Depp as well). For Entourage fans, an extremely young Drama is a crazy ass teenager in it, but still has the same voice haha.<br /><br />(also on the topic for Entourage fans, watch HARVARD MAN!!!! God that was a great movie, Adrian Grenier is in it and he trips a shit ton of LSD and goes berserk. And Sarah Michelle Gellar isn&#039;t annoying in it.)<br /><br />But uhm back to Platoon. The thing I liked about Platoon is it divided them into 2 groups, the stoner group and the hard nose group, and the stoner group are the good guys.
