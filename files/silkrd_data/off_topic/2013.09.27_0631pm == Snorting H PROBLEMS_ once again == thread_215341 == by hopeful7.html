				Hey SR Friends!<br /><br />I posted a while back about how snorting H really messes with my nose. Some of you posted it might be the cut or something I am allergic to.&nbsp; But I have now ordered from three separate vendors (my top 3 forever), and the same thing happens over and over again.&nbsp; It is really messing with those good feelings, if you KWIM.<br /><br />I usually order every month or every other month just to help my script stretch a bit.&nbsp; The first day I do it, I am fine.&nbsp; The next day I wake up with a majorly stuffed up nose and sometimes sneezes. After that, even snorting it will send me into fits of those horrible HARD sneezes (HATE those!).&nbsp; I have tried saline, other nasal spray, cleaning out with toothpicks, and I can&#039;t get over this problem.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why this happens to me so quickly.&nbsp; I also wonder if it is the cut, is it all cut with the same thing?&nbsp; I have Googled this problem and trying all over the above, but by evening you can hear in my voice that my sinuses are completely stuffed up.&nbsp; I clear my nose and clean it before bed, and I wake up miserable. As soon as I take my first snort I am sent into FITS of sneezing.&nbsp; Almost like I am snorting chili powder up my nose!&nbsp; This is really messing with how enjoyable the experience is on day one.<br /><br />Does this happen to anyone else out there have this issue or have you heard of it?&nbsp; &nbsp; I get so I am actually relieved when I get my script refill so I can give my nose a rest (and I also ingest VERY little compared to most, from what I have read).<br /><br />I know I posted about this before, but I am so puzzled, and I just cannot believe I am the only one this happens to.<br />Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks!

				Why dont you just make the most of it without shooting? Get an oral syringe or a regular needled one...the ends come off on some...add your water and dope to spoon...then plug it up your butt...damn near the same rush as shooting it up - zero waste - no sinus shit. Make sure you take a good shit about 30 minutes prior and lube that hole and syringe. =P Sounds crazy but it doesnt hurt...

				Yes, I have heard of, researched, and thought of plugging. However, my concern is what if the stuff irritates THAT AREA the same as it does my nose/sinuses?&nbsp; lol!&nbsp; How do I explain THAT one to a doctor?&nbsp; Now I have a light, red, blotchy rash on my stomach.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand what the deal is with me and the H.&nbsp; Maybe I need to find a new drug.&nbsp; I do want to try SunWu&#039;s fent, but I never plan ahead far enough, as the orders take five to ten days, and by the time I get money, I usually have to do overnight. <br /><br />I will give you post some thought.

				No it doesn&#039;t bother it at all man. Promise. Its going to suck quitting either way...if you go 5 days without it then you can easily stop though. Seriously. Shits too expensive to do all the time. I like it as a treat...these days. I used to be addicted and I know how it is. You CAN do it. First try tapering your dose. Then after a week of that try and have some benzos on hand. You&#039;ll still feel rough but its not unbearable.

				I am on a pain script, and I use this to make it last a bit longer, when I get to the end of the month.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do it every month, but it cheaper than trying to buy more pills.&nbsp; The thing is, I don&#039;t really like it except for that first day, lol.&nbsp; I definitely mean it when I say &quot;I want a new drug.&quot;
