				I WILL BUY THIS ACCOUNT. PLEASE MESSAGE ME.<br /><br />it just so happens i have 10,000 each of oxy 10, 20, 40, and 80s - they will be $0.05 / mg. i have 50k hits of lsd in any form you can imagine. i have two hundred pounds of pure cocaine and even more pure meth, dmt, salvia, MMJ, ludes, syrup. All my prices will be 60% cheaper than other vendors. <br /><br />Hope you don&#039;t mind FE, you&#039;ll need to FE so I can offer these crazy low prices. About the time things really start moving I&#039;m going to post at the top of my vendor page about being behind on messages, but that I&#039;ll get to you. Will also mention free shipping with FE and 20% additional product for the next 72 hours (while I get caught up on messages).<br /><br />thanks to this vendor account will be able to purchase a home early 2014. <br /><br />message me.

				well, so much for a honest vendor who try to sell his account<br />I was interested and he mailed me, I asked him what his price was.<br />He had already excepted an offer .... and still try to sell to me for more....<br /><br />He said:<br />&nbsp;<br />quote<br />like I said...a have an offer of $350...which I already accepted but now I am having second thoughts because lots of smaller vendors are interested in shipments of 1,000 pills or more...<br /><br />you can buy a new account for $350...? try $500...plus by the time you pay for bitcoin fees and if you re smart put your coin through bitcoin fog...you abou $550 at least...good luck..<br />anyway I may decide to keep my account and sell wholesale...to smaller sellers<br /><br />So, for what it is worth (not much with nothing in it )<br />Not for me,,, anyone...?

				To my question why he just sold to another guy when he already had an agreement with me.<br />Pharmaking:<br />the transaction process never started...all we had was a verbal agreement...which any party can back out at any time...<br /><br />In his eyes there is no process started when you talk about buying something, when you say you want it and pay so and so&nbsp; much.<br />He does not understand that &#039;&#039;a verbal&#039;&#039; agreement is an agreement, period.<br />And that it is not only &#039;&#039;verbal&#039;&#039; it is also in writing.<br /><br />Then he said:<br />.the buyer made an offer of $350 and I said okay...but he needed a couple of days to come up with the money...in the meantime I decided to hang onto the account...at least until I see how selling pills of 1,000 or more works out...<br /><br />So, he &#039;&#039;sold&#039;&#039; it to me.<br />Then he &#039;&#039;sold&#039;&#039; it to this other guy (maybe weeal?) who was trying to get the money (and end up with no account!)<br />And now he decided not to sell and keep it to see how selling of his pills will work out.<br /><br />Well, it is a great way to start a vendor account.<br />With how many - can you start an account.<br /><br />PHARMAKING, PLEASE TELL ME THAT I CAN TRUST YOU WHEN I BUY FROM YOU...... LOL!!!<br /><br />Maybe a moderator can stop this because somebody will be fucked.<br />He is just openly scamming people<br /><br />We did not only had a verbal agreement, by telling that we had he even put that in writing.<br />

				The sale of any goods or services via the forums needs to be transacted through the SR escrow system, I&#039;m passing this up to the admins now.<br /><br />
