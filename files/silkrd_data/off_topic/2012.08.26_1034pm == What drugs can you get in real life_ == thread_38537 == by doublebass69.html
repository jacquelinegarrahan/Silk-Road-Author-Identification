				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously on SR you can get pretty much any drug, any quality, and any quanity.&nbsp; <br />But i am curious to see what other members can get in real life. <br />For me I can get:<br /><br />Weed-All qualities but medical and no more then a QP<br />Coke-Lowest quality coke imagined, and no more than a eight ball<br />Mushrooms- Once or twice a year, often shitty<br />LSD- Fake research chemicals probably not lsd except for maybe once a year<br />MDMA, Rolls- Fake or low quailty mdma(never reagent tested) and medium quality at raves, often bath salts<br />Misc- Clonapen, Adderal at cheap prices,occasional opiates, and of course other drugs you can get at raves<br /><br />All other drugs are not obtainable, what drugs can you get IRL?

				Weed - from bushweed to beautifully homegrown depending on time of year (have only one househgrower.)<br />Coke - shit to good<br />Brown - dont use but easy to get<br />Lsd - real and reasonably strong 150-200<br />Boomers- depends on season- usually lib caps<br />Base - surprisingly strong for uk speed-comes and goes<br />Mdma- banging pills and banging powder<br />Ket- place is flooded with good stuff, been a bit of a drought though recently<br /><br />No rc&#039;s on road except maybe 2cb but have to travel a long way

				Weed ranging from Mexican brick to very very high quality medical bud. I don&#039;t smoke weed anymore, though.<br />Methamphetamine is rampant here, I can&#039;t comment on the quality as I am not a regular user, but it always has been nice looking shards.<br />&quot;Ecstasy&quot;.....very low quality speedy pills sold for as cheap as $5 each. You get what you pay for.<br />Shrooms which have always been good quality, $25-30 an 8th. <br />&quot;LSD&quot; which is pretty much invariably always some shitty RC psychedelic instead.<br />Methadone $3 per 10mg. <br /><br />So yeah I pretty much don&#039;t even bother with that nonsense anymore. SR is amazing.

				Weed&#039;s everywhere, and shrooms are also everywhere during Winter (Psilocybe Subaeruginosa, stronger than cubensis). <br /><br />I can also get &#039;acid&#039; for AU$20-$40 a tab, but it is rarely ever real LSD. There&#039;s plenty of meth around for about $70+ a point, but I&#039;m not into that. <br /><br />Know of a few people who have taken &#039;ecstasy&#039;, which they paid $25-$30 a pill for, but it turned out to be speed or a RC.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love the Silk Road&nbsp; ;D<br />

				I&#039;m usually just looking for good bud and psychedelics, but I&#039;ll list the stuff I&#039;ve come across.<br /><br />This stuff I can usually get on a regular basis if I wanted to:<br /><br />Weed - everything from brick to medical, but usually somewhere in between<br />Mushrooms - Usually taste like cow shit unless me or my buddies grow em ourselves (lots of farms in the area)<br />Heroin - Never touched it myself though<br />Ketamine - This seems to be popular around my area, been coming across a lot of it lately<br /><br />This stuff comes and goes:<br /><br />Acid -&nbsp; haven&#039;t come across legit acid outside of SR in about 3 years now<br />MDMA - few pills I&#039;ve ever gotten around here are definitely cut with shit and not strong<br />Meth - came across this 2x in the last 5 years but never tried it myself<br />I also randomly come across xanax, oxys, percs, and other various pills.
