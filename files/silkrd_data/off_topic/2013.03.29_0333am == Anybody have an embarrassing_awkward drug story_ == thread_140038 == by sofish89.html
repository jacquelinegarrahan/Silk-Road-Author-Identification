				Well heres mine:<br />I was once in line at the drycleaners and while I was handing the lady my jacket, I told her to wait for a second because I had forgotten some paperwork in one of the jacket pockets. I pulled out the papers, and I went to check other pockets. I felt something weirdly shaped in the inner pocket so I pulled it out and then realized that I had just pulled out a 2 gram bag of K while the lady was holding out her hand waiting for my jacket. She saw the bag, looked at me, and gave a small smile and said &quot;Ok sir so your clothing will be ready on the 29th..&quot;. I was so embarrassed I just mumbled a thank you and got out of the store as fast as I could

				Subbing. This should be an interesting thread. There were a couple threads about stupidest things done on drugs and most regrettable sexual acts performed on drugs...I unfortunately (fortunately?) do not have any stories to add to this thread, but I know there are quite a few people out there with VERY interesting stories...

				My most recent awkward moment was I brought a nosey-bitch girl back to mine after only meeting with her a few times before, she&#039;s a very, very anti-drug person (never even touched an illegal substance and will give you a lecture for hours on end about &#039;how drugs are bad&#039;.) the situation was a bit awkward anyway because we didn&#039;t really know each other that well at the time. So to make conversation she decides to start looking through my stuff and inevitability she finds my stash which consisted of about 5or6grams worth of MDMA and MDA, About 15 xtc pills and capsules, a few caps of Moxy, a gram or so of speed, a small amount of meth, 2ish grams of K, half gram of coke, a 1/4 gram and a few caps of 2cb etc etc.. and this was all separated into labeled individual baggies inside a carrier bag. <br />It was one of those &#039;get the fuck out of my house&#039; moments. Extremely awkward.. I thought she was gunna call the police and I&#039;ve never seen any one look so frightened looking at a bag of drugs, she even muttered a few words to herself in what I presume was just disbelief before I took them off her. She now thinks I&#039;m the biggest druggy going. I try to tell her about harm reduction and sensible/infrequent use but shes too brainwashed to understand. Not that it matters though. <br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of embarrassing moments that have happened on MDMA which I&#039;m sure a lot of you can relate too, not whilst I&#039;m on it though, just as it wears off and reality brutally smashes you in face like a rubber flip flop and you just think to yourself, why the fuck am I doing this? As I&#039;m butt naked cuddling with friends.

				My most awkward/awesome drug story would have to be my first use of bud at the age of 13. I was on one of those family vacations that include a family reunion so my family and a few cousins were staying at my grandmas. Myself and 2 of my cousins had said we were going to play some sort of game out in the vast fields on my grandma&#039;s property. We in fact decided to light up and halfway through our second joint, my dad had found us. After a long awkward moment of silence, he asked to get down on the sesh instead of punishing me. To this day we share the occasional session when possible.

				My most awkward story is probably the time I freaked out getting a blow job on dmt. <br /><br />I was on shrooms that night and decided to go for a walk around town by myself at like 2 am. After about an hour of walking I decided I wanted to drive around a bit (I don&#039;t drive while tripping anymore) so I called this girl I had a thing with to give me a ride to my van. Now this girl was by no means anti drug but she was pretty fucking sheltered, she had no idea what most drugs did or how to identify them or anything. Because of this she was a bit concerned about me driving around on shrooms so she told me she would come with and if I fucked up even a little bit she would take over.<br />Well I did end up fucking up a little bit driving around (I&#039;d have been fine if my contacts were in!) so I pulled into some random person&#039;s driveway and went to the back of my van to smoke some dmt. This girl followed me to the back and I guess probably assumed we were going to have sex because why the fuck else is this dumb ass climbing into the back of his van while parked in some random fuckers driveway? Well I had a preloaded iolite vape ready with my deems and I blasted off, pretty much ignoring the girl completely. <br />She had no idea what dmt does and must have been bored or felt left out or something because she started taking my pants off and trying to give me a blow job (without much success, my willy was in hyperspace too) while I was flying through hyperspace. <br /><br />The experience was very unpleasant, i was pretty sure some sort of extraterrestrial&nbsp; had materialized from another dimension to eat me alive starting with my penis. So I tried to escape, as any sane person would do when confronted with a genital devouring alien. My escape was less than graceful, it pretty much consisted of me doing a flip into the second row of seats then wedging myself on the floor in front of those seats and behind the drivers seat where I cowered for the duration of my trip to hyperspace.<br />The girl was confused as fuck, I had some explaining to do once I came down from the dmt.

				I hooked up with a woman and took a bunch of mixed benzos and woke up with my bed and dick completely covered in shit and with the woman nowhere to be found. Apparently we had both blacked out and we tried anal and she must have shit everywhere and left to clean up or flee or something and never came back.&nbsp; <br /><br />I threw away my sheets and never brought it up again. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ok, so one time I was at a party on a beach. This particular party was one of those ones that tries to be a &quot;rave&quot; but just makes a poor attempt at it. Basically I got bored and so I started smoking joint after joint with my buddies. I had some ketamine on me, and I bumped a couple of small (~40mg) lines, just to get that slight dissociation and kind of drunkenness going.<br /><br />After abut an hour or so the girl I was seeing at the time (who was a solid 9...not to brag or anything) turned up, and she was bored as fuck too. We decided to go and get some privacy further down the beach and have a little sexual fun. We found a secluded place in amongst some big rocks and began going at it. Bear in mind, this chick frowns upon all drug use (despite only ever having smoked weed once) and so she was a little pissed at me when she tasted it on my breath. Despite this, she dropped her clothes so fast that I literally didn&#039;t notice her doing so. However, she had no idea about the ket I had taken. <br /><br />I realized that that throughout this time my cock was completely flaccid, and as I&#039;m a young guy this wasn&#039;t a problem I&#039;ve ever had before. I hoped that it would gain some strength with a little more time, so I began eating her out. She was going crazy, like writhing all over the place and groaning really loudly. Then she said to me, &quot;I want you inside me right now&quot; and I knew I had a problem. Before I could say anything she ripped my jeans down and started sucking my still limp cock. After about a minute she goes, &quot;Why isn&#039;t it getting hard?&quot;, and I come up with, &quot;Because the sea breeze is really fucking cold!&quot; This might have worked except for the fact that the previous day we fucked in her swimming pool which was about 10 degrees celcius at the time, so she knew something was up. She stuffed her hands in my pockets (which were by my ankles so I couldn&#039;t exactly stop her) and pulled out my bag of ket. As soon as she saw it she flipped her shit, saying stuff like, &quot;I can&#039;t believe you let me get completely naked, then lick my pussy whilst knowing that you can&#039;t fuck me too, especially in a public place!&quot; I tried explaining to her that I had no idea she wanted to fuck, but I didn&#039;t succeed as she knows that I know her too well. The night ended with her going home early, and very embarrassed, and me continuing to smoke more weed and bump a couple more lines of ket. <br /><br />The next time I saw this girl she said I had to choose between her and hard drugs (she considers anything except weed a hard drug), and so I tried to reason with her but she was not exactly the most intelligent person and thus couldn&#039;t understand that there is a difference between shooting H three times a day and doing ket, MDMA, LSD or shrooms every now-and-again. I told her I didn&#039;t want to be with someone that doesn&#039;t want me for who I am. <br /><br />So that&#039;s it; my most embarrassing drug experience was getting a limp dick, leading a chick on, and then having it all come crashing down on me. Lucky I wasn&#039;t that into her.<br />- JH
