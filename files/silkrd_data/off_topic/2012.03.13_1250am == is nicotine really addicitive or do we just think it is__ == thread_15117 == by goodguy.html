				several things made me think this mainly the fact i seem to be able to start and stop smoking whenever i choose, but a friend of mine told me how his grandma always used to say how new coke was never as good as the original (obviously because the original had small dose&#039;s of coke in it) but nobody had the heart to tell her, so i thought to myself if she wasn&#039;t addicted to an obviously addictive substance because she didnt know what she was taking then addiction must be something we can control.<br /><br />i would like to hear anyone&#039;s thoughts on this :)

				nicotine addiction is one of the hardest to break, since its pharmalogical and behavioral characteristics of addiction are similar to those of crack addiction or heroin addiction. see http://www1.umn.edu/perio/tobacco/nicaddct.html

				all addiction is a choice, everytime you smoke or take a drug IT IS A CHOICE THAT YOU ARE MAKING.<br /><br />choose to do drugs/smoke, or choose not to.. its fucking simple.. addicts are weak people that need a reality check.<br /><br />THAT BEING SAID: i feel for people suffering from detox when they choose to quit, sounds like hell..<br /><br />(from opiates i mean.. fuck smokers there a bunch of pussys.. just quit..)<br /><br />ok im done ranting haha

That hasn&#039;t been around for a LONG fucking time. &quot;New Coke&quot; was a new formulation of coca cola that they came out with about 20 years ago. <br /><br />And yes nicotine is addicting. How can someone say they feel for someone going through detox for opiates (also terrible and addicting) and not feel for someone going through withdrawls from another substance? It&#039;s all terrible. Yes, smoking tobacco is stupid but that doesn&#039;t make a smoker less human..

				Themessenger is about the principle active. Coca-cola stopped with it in the XIX century. The new coke happened about the 80&#039;s, but they came back with the classic coke after the sales plummeted. Some years, pepsi sold more than coke.<br /><br />You can find more information here (surface web links)<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUQtrhtiSYU<br />Sorry, just find it in portuguese.<br /><br />It&#039;s a series of documentaries of History Channel:<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985711/<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Eats<br /><br />And nicotine is truly additive. Very chemical/physical/ addictive, but not only that. There is something social about addiction too. That&#039;s why bodybuilders prefer steroids and workaholics prefer stimulants. <br /><br />Cigarette is the most easy-to-get drug in the world and it is very social acceptable. You can find cigarettes anywhere, nobody will judge (actually, they will, but it&#039;s not the same like other drugs), the cups will not arrest you and it does not prevent you to work (like alcohol).

				Nicotine is definitely very addictive. Before I tried it, I used to scoff at claims that it is close in addictiveness to coke &amp; H. It&#039;s still a bit hard to believe (it&#039;s hard to shake that drug war propaganda), but I&#039;ve been clean over a month and I still get mad cravings. My roommate left a half smoked cig that I&#039;ve been resisting for the past half hour.

				I&#039;m not sure I can empathize (sympathize, maybe) with others regarding nicotine addiction. I smoke cigarettes, probably a pack or two a week. Around a year ago, it was 3-4 packs a week. There have been periods where I smoke almost a pack a day, and there have been periods where I stop smoking altogether for weeks on end, with little to no urge to smoke again.<br /><br />I have an e-cig and haven&#039;t really used it since purchasing it. I feel that I smoke more for the feeling of smoke entering my lungs, joining others in a circle, performing a ritual, etc. than for nicotine.<br /><br />Interestingly, a couple times that I stopped smoking altogether may have been the result of amphetamine use. When I took Adderall for a week or so, I stopped smoking and didn&#039;t resume until a couple weeks later. Then again, the next time I took Adderall (months later), I went through half a pack in an hour.

				Nicotine by itself isn&#039;t all that addictive, at least not in my opinion. I found it to be about as habit forming as caffeine.<br /><br />When you take in pure nicotine from something like e-cigarettes, you aren&#039;t getting the other substances in tobacco that support the addiction i.e. various MAIO-acting compounds. I never actively smoked cigarettes so I wouldn&#039;t know if they were addictive or not, but I can say that I&#039;ve smoked every day for a week or two and felt nothing when I stopped. I doubt I&#039;d be able to say the same thing if I was taking opiates for 2 weeks, but that&#039;s probably because smoking is fucking gross unless you&#039;re stressed or constipated, and opiates don&#039;t make me feel like I just inhaled radioactive nerve gas (not far from the truth lol).
