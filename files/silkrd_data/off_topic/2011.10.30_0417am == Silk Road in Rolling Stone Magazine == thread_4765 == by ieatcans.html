				In the newest issue of Rolling Stone magazine, which I got in the mail today, there&#039;s an article on page 74 about Silk Road.<br /><br />That&#039;s how I found out about this site and why I&#039;m here now.<br /><br />I suspect I won&#039;t be the only one.<br /><br />I apologize in advance for the inevitable noob flood, and nice to meet all of you.

				Welcome To the Road.<br />If I may offer a bit of friendly advice. It would be please use the search function before asking a question as most questions that have to do with anything and everything have already been asked&nbsp; and the answers are right there at your fingertips.<br /><br />So, welcome and happy travels :)

If you can work out how to safely download and use TOR, open up and fund an exchange account with bitcoin, tumble your coins into SR and use PGP to maintain anonymity then you&#039;re already ahead.

				I just happened to have had the issue on my desk, unopened! <br /><br />when i saw the post I was surprised. it is a small article and not as detailed as the article i read online which led me here, but someone with a little knowledge could figure it out.<br /><br />Its not easy... i&#039;m still trying to figure out the bitcoin thing.<br /><br />but i do feel semi safe here. l hope i am. I&#039;m too old to be buying on the street anymore.

				SR is flooding the streets with drugs! Ahhhhhhh, hide the children and pets. Get out the sandbags to stave off the inevitable flood!&nbsp; <br />What a bunch of jackasses.&nbsp; I like how were all referred to as &quot;bad guys&quot;.&nbsp; I like to think of myself as a decent human being.<br />Anyway, I hope the people of NY realize just what an asshat Chuck Schumer is, using this as another avenue to exercise authority and take away rights under the fear banner.<br />Get up stand up people!<br />&nbsp;;D<br />

				The article if remarkably similar to that which was published by Gawker abt 5 months ago. And the Reefer Madness movies from a few years ago.<br />Many of these so call &quot;articles&quot; do not acknowledge that there were many other online sources before SR and there still are. <br />Remember folks, loose lips sink ships.
