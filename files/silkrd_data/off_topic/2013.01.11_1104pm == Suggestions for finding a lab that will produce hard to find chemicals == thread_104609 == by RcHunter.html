				I think the thread title sums up what I wanting. Not looking for scheduled but analog maybe how do I find lab that will make what I want and ship to the USA?

				Honestly, for a lab to do a custom synth just for you, you&#039;d have to be kicking down some big bucks, unless you want kilos of this chemical, it&#039;s probably more cost effective to find it already synthed.

				^ This is spot on. There was a thread I read about some guy asking a lab to synth him some wild and wonderful nootropics and the cost was in the $1000&#039;s. Fair enough if you&#039;ve got it kicking about you could ask some RC companies who they source from or if they are willing to put the feelers out for you to find a lab that can help you. Failing that you could take the $1000&#039;s you were going to spend on synthing and get an education in organic chemistry and buy some lab equipment. Teach a man to fish and all that.

				I can offer advice but not sources.&nbsp; This is real easy to get done but depending on what it is you will have very high minimums, hard to get anything less than 1kg unless its a very complex compound.&nbsp; Oh yeah and CHINA CHINA CHINA<br /><br />I am thinking of writing a guide about how to do this kind of thing, sourcing chemicals, logistics of making illicit chemistry money.&nbsp; Anyone interested?&nbsp; Similar price point and length as my other guides.

				I&#039;m interested, but not for the price of your other guides. :/ I don&#039;t have that kind of cash flow at the moment.
