				* - I was hammering away on my papers when I got inspired to write this little poem for all you Road roamers. - *<br />* - If anybody else has a poem for the Road, or feels inspired to write one, Lets hear it! -*<br /><br />So I noticed that at this moment, as I was smoking my sidecar,<br />That there was something amiss among the silkiness.<br />I know a noob shall not expect to be respected, <br />But I want you to see, a perspective that grows inside me, and it on the rise in society.<br />The generation that are the teens of today, are those that have the most to say.<br />There are more than ever, but the opinions they have are like a feather. <br />They are easily convinced of social trends and base their life around their friends.<br /><br />The web and its social networking is dangerously increasing the level of consumerism that we ingest. <br />At the same time, more people are using the web to do research before they invest.<br />Have I lost you off the far end yet?<br />Humans know from research that the web changes our brain but we aren&#039;t sure exactly.<br />Most studies seem to show it makes people think abstractly.<br />The Government as we see it today is a pretty linear system. <br />But it looks to me like the educated adolescents of today may resist them.<br />As they begin to take office positions, the new views will cause suspicions.<br />As those with abstract minds, grow to join the ballot lines,<br />The change will begin to be defined. <br /><br />The web is teaching people to critically think.<br />More people are learning to question their views and come to the brink.<br />They have a view that if you believe it, say it. <br />The great majority use the web to relay it.<br />Every person strives to be unique.<br />Yet our teenagers motivation is especially weak.<br />So they continue to use their screens instead of their feet.<br />They will come together in a way that no generation could before.<br />Corporations will reach for support, but fall through the floor.<br />And its starting with something we all abhor,<br />The drug war.<br />Thank you Tor.<br /><br />This is not a business that is influenced by advertising or how much someone spends on capturing an individual&#039;s focus.<br />There are no pop-up or side-banner ads that flash with &quot;smoke this!&quot;<br />This free market is bigger than any of us<br />Its a representation of what the new generation is made of.<br />We know that we want the government to protect our homes,<br />But we donâ€™t expect to be scrutinized for what paths we choose to roam<br />Let us each walk along this road <br />We are going somewhere fast, but where? <br />No one knows.<br /><br />

				If I could give you my own karma, I would give you at least 10 of them, from my own numbers. I would gladly drop AT LEAST 10 +1&#039;s to give them to you. That poem was amazing, truly amazing. Bravo. You get my stamp of approval, and hey, modify your post and put that stamp in the thread-title if you&#039;d like. :)

				very nice!<br /><br />I always thought that the song &quot;Dirt Road&quot; by Jason Aldean could be tweaked a bit to the &quot;Silk Road.&quot;<br /><br />The chorus goes: &quot;Yeah I&#039;m chillin&#039; on a dirt road, laid back swervin&#039; like I&#039;m George Jones. Smoke rollin out the window, an ice cold beer sittin&#039; in the console.&quot;<br /><br />I imagined something like &quot;Yeah I&#039;m chillin&#039; on the Silk Road, ______________________&quot;<br /><br />Haha just a thought, I&#039;m not musically inclined to rhyme or make anything. Wouldn&#039;t want it it to get too public either......&nbsp; ;)

				How Ironic, I read your poem and i came here to post then i read your message stating &quot;I&#039;m writing like H.D. Thoreau&quot; i was going to say something similar in my post in that i caught the civil disobediant tones in the poem so great minds do think alike....which is an incredibly stupid saying because a great mind must think differently to be of note, but i digress, excellent work and since i have some of Hammertime coming towards me at the moment i hope to bask in a similar glow!

				I wonder how much longer Thoreau&#039;s writing would be if he had some good crystal to puff on! The glow certainly warms the body, mind and soul alike. If you feel like Rhyme Ranting, venture back here and enlighten us!

				We&#039;ve woven a path from the finest of threads<br />that fellow travelers have left in their wake,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />spun from oriental routes of oral renown.<br />Now a virtual road has become well-trodden, <br />and we follow in the footsteps of others - <br />until we can learn to walk together.<br /><br />We exist in a space that the State cannot close,<br />where access is a privilege to be (l)earned.<br />They touch the Silk with dirty, calloused hands - <br />They know not how to caress it with love,<br />or what it means to wrap yourself in it&#039;s warmth.<br />Tender taffeta transportation to...(insert destination here)?<br /><br />Globalization at it&#039;s most fundamental - <br />Where people cannot cross borders, goods can.<br />So learn Tor, Bitcoin and cryptography - <br />and when you feel confident come and join us.<br />Contribute to community consensus<br />Or dissent - your opinion is noted.<br />&nbsp;<br />It&#039;s about fucking time we took back control<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
