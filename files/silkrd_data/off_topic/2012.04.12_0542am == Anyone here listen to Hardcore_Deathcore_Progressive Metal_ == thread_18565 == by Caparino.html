				Yeah I&#039;ve heard of them, I don&#039;t listen to them often though.<br />I more so listened to them in my late teens, after my post-hardcore stage.<br /><br />I listen to raggacore (like breakcore mixed with ragga vox)<br />And chipbreak (8bit mixed with breakcore)<br /><br />I remember when I used to think everything made on a computer was crap.. how times have changed when I&#039;ve become more open to things.

				Not really weird... everything else just falls into useless shit. Metal and GOOD rap actually have deep meanings and articulate profound ideas.

				Interesting, an ideas listener.<br />I listen to music simply to analyze and breakdown the data, it&#039;s in my personality.<br />That&#039;s probably why I listen to complex weird shit.

				Tool is really good shit; their music inspires different perceptions and their lyrics are matched almost by none. I&#039;d say they fall under &quot;Technical Metal&quot;, sorry for being a genrefag haha.

				I turn into a genre fag when I listen to the fuck out of a genre, and everything that I think runs through my social-coolness filter.<br />It&#039;s not a nice place to be, back in juniour high state of mind.<br /><br />I&#039;m an intense genre nut in chiptune/chipbreak and breakcore/(ragga)jungle.<br />Then I realize, nobody even knows what these are.<br />And I say, fuck it. And forget them all, listen to wahtever I want without thinking of that social aspect. <br /><br />But when I listened to more popular music, the genres that people would talk/know about a lot I&#039;d get pretty snobby :P<br />Not sure if I still would, as I&#039;m not in high school anymore.
