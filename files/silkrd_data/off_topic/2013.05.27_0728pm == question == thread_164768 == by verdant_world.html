				most logical explanation would be that Gus got suspicious after Jesse told him that Brock was poisoned, he also is aware of Walt&#039;s capabilities and that he desperately wants to kill him and knew that this would be an easy opportunity for him, he didn&#039;t know that the car was rigged with a bomb, but he went with &quot;better safe than sorry - or dead in this case&quot;.

				I really fucking loved that scene, and I have always liked to think that he just sensed it there somehow. Makes me all goosebumpy just thinking about it. Can&#039;t wait for it to be back!!

				I think what happened is during Jesse and Gus encounter if you remember Jesse was speaking to Gus kinda of in a blaming tone and all up in his face. However Gus was there for 2 reasons:<br /><br />1) To get Jesse back into the lab as quickly as possible to prevent anymore financial loss<br />2) As weird as it sounds to offer emotional support and anything to do to help as he put his whole operation on Jess and has a lot invested in him<br /><br />Now if we look at Gus&#039; personality and do a quick profile of him we learn a couple of other things. Gus tried to be unusually accommodating to Jess during this scene. With Walt he had more of a heavy handed approach as Walts intelligence and stubbornness got in the way of Walt being totally subserviant to Gus. <br /><br />My theory is a little different than everyone else&#039;s. At first I thought the same thing but know what I believed happend is that by the time Gus got to the car he had played over the whole encounter in his head and something was off about. Jess was usually very subserviant and did as he was told. But in that scene I think he sensed the level of malice in Jesses words and his tone and he quickly formulated a plan B. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think he had the thought that Walt had put a bomb in his car. For all his concerns regarding Walt I feel like he thought that issue was done with once he threatened his family. My theory is based on things I observed about Gus&#039; personality. He was very analytical. He calculated all risks. He knew how to hold a grudge but not show any emotion or reveal his true feelings. He could be your best friend if you made him money but if you started to cost him money he would be your worst nightmare. This is not something he would hide from people though. He didn&#039;t go around saying it explicilty but I think everyone involved got the picture and Jess was brighter than your average meth cook so Gus must of known that Jess would know this fact but yet Jess in that scene basically blamed him for the poisioning without blaming him? I don&#039;t think this is something Gus picked up at that time but by the time he walked to his car he figured that out. Ok so then he thinks if Jesse is blaming me for the posioning and I didn&#039;t do it then who did? Who would do something like that? Everything we know about Gus would lead us to believe that his first guess would be Walt.. and from the there it quickly escalates... ya I know I have too much time on my hands ..<br /><br />He was truly a remarkable character and was utterly sad to see him go. Probably my favourite character in the whole show. The actor that plays him used to be in a lot of movies back in the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s. Anyways that&#039;s my theory.. take it with a grain of salt. I have a tendency to make everything more complicated than it is but it just seems more interesting that you.<br /><br />

				Yep, that&#039;s what I loved about him. His deadly professionalism and lack of emotion and just ruthlessness was impressive. Ok another question about Gus. Why do you guys think he killed his lackey with the box cutter?<br /><br />I have two theories regarding that:<br /><br />A) He say the police sketch at the station and his lackey become a liability<br /><br />B)This theory is a bit more interesting. Ok remember how the cook got delayed because they didn&#039;t know if they were going to kill Walt and Jess until Gus arrives and Walt kept pressuring them to let him cook. The lackey(forget his name) was all like I can cook. But who authorized him to be the fing cook?! I think Gus killed him in front of Walt and Jesse to show them you do what I tell you and that&#039;s it..don&#039;t fuck with me.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear some other theories cause that&#039;s something I never settled on.

				Hmmmmm very interesting. Ya I never did take his meticulous nature into consideration regarding that event. So he hated Walt because he was a huge pain in the ass but held him in high regard because of his extraordinary skillset and talents. I think I like that theory. Seems more plausible than my two. <br /><br />I really hope the second half of the season is going to be good though. IDK how I feel about having Walt as the bad guy. I mean it was kinda cool when he was the underdog and out of his element and now he&#039;s just turned into a monster. He&#039;s actually worse than Gus ever was. Gus never let emotion get in the way of business which to me it seems Walt is the total opposite. There&#039;s an interesting dynamic with him and Jess though. It&#039;s almost a father/son relationship. If I had to make one guess for the second half of the season I&#039;d say that somehow Walt is going to need saving and Jesse saves his ass.

				Breaking Bad is one of, if not the best show on television.&nbsp; Not because of the whole drug scene but because it has excellent writing, acting, plot, and pace.&nbsp; It is so rare for a non sci fi show to grab me like this one has. <br /><br />I also have no idea how Gus avoided the bomb in the car, it threw me a bit and I thought maybe I missed something.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t think he did know for sure, he just knew he need to get out of there.&nbsp; His previous conversation with Jesse probably tipped him off to danger in general but I doubt he knew how close he came to getting blown up before he was actually blown up.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing his spidey sense just went off and he bolted.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Stuff like this is what makes the show great, leaving stuff up to us to kind of scratch our heads.&nbsp; Gus was one of the best characters on the show, now the actor is on once up a time, bah!&nbsp; It&#039;s been almost 2 years come back already!

				Loving the psych-crafting in this thread. +1 to as many as possible.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164768.msg1169865#msg1169865">Quote from: Miah on May 28, 2013, 04:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ok another question about Gus. Why do you guys think he killed his lackey with the box cutter?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>In one of the episodes in series 3, Gus has Mike do a background check on his employee to be. When Mike suggests violence as a means of influence, Frings response is very telling:<br /><br />&quot;... fear is not an effective motivator of men&quot;.<br /><br />Here you have an empathic chameleon-like social operator who is a pillar of the business community, but to be able to make a statement about fear like that with such conviction, one must know what it is to use fear to motivate and also what it is like to be motivated by fear.<br /><br />Whilst all of the above reasons for Victors (the wannabe meth-cook-cum-overseer) death I would agree with, I would also suggest that on some level Fring had his own fear. Victors face was seen at the crime location by multiple witnesses and given his closeness to Fring, this was not an acceptable risk.<br /><br />Everything else was just supporting evidence and the cold theatrics of the necessity that, this time, fear was the only motivating emotion in the room. The person both most in control of the room and in touch with his emotions was Gus. <br /><br />Hence a very cold-appearing but cost counted 187 with a box cutter.<br /><br />All IMHO.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for the conclusion in Aug...&nbsp; &nbsp; :)

				I also really wondered about this and wasn&#039;t sure why it happened, wish Vince Gilligan would have explained it.&nbsp; Seems so out of character.<br /><br />I think the final season will see Walt ultimately destroy his family. The who show has started with him being a family man, doing everything for his family and someone the audience can relate to, to becoming a horrible monster of a person who will kill anyone who is in his way.&nbsp; No one else would have murdered all those people in 2 minutes, not Mike, Jesse, Sklyer or Gus. It&#039;s Mr Chips to Scarface, and i really think in the final episodes he will turn on someone in his family - maybe Hank, Jesse, Marie, or Skyler.&nbsp; Hopefully not his children though, that would be awful. That would bring him full circle - he started to protect his family, and in the end destroys his family.&nbsp; Could really see Hank confronting Walt about it and then Walt killing him. <br /><br />Really hope Jesse survives though, and gets some peace of mind.&nbsp; Poor guy has done some bad things but just wants to be a better person :( When todd shot that little kid it was heartbreaking.&nbsp; But like Walt said himself, &quot;everyone dies in this movie&quot;.

				I thought at the end he goes into witness protection and meets Lois?<br />Isn&#039;t breaking bad a prequel to Malcolm in the middle?

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, I very much liked Walt as the underdog. He didn&#039;t like it in some ways, but I think he should have realised he isn&#039;t cut out to be top dog, he doesn&#039;t have the professionalism or business abilities to control such an operation independently from his emotions and family life. One of my favourite scenes if how well Gus points out his awareness of Walt&#039;s situation when he says &quot;What does a man do Walter? A man provides for his family.&quot; Walt responds with &quot;This has cost me my family&quot; and Gus&#039;s brilliant reply was &quot;Whilst you have children you always have family, they will always be your priority your responsibility. And a man, a man provides. And he does it even when he&#039;s not appreciated, or respected, or even loved. He simply bears up and he does it. Because he&#039;s a man.&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I remeber that scene, it very profound. Another thing is Walt didn&#039;t need to go down the path he choose. He was offered to have his whole treatment paid for by that pencil neck at Grey Matter but he refused. He then offered him a job so he can get the full health benefits and again he refused. Walt has a serious ego issue that stems from his totally mundane and under achieving life. He had to prove too himself he is more and he did. He could of settled at any one point. He could of worked for Gus shut the fuck up and due what he&#039;s told. But again his ego got in the way. As I&#039;ve been watching the shows it just seems to be that despite all Walts achievements it became almost like an addiction to the be the &#039;top dog&#039;. <br /><br />Another thing that I found interesting was in Season 2 I believe when Sal first got introduced into the pciture. Sal and Walts relationship was more like Sal persuaded or told Walt what to do next. Then I think in Season 5 Sal wanted out and got fresh with Walt and he got all up in Sals grill. It was like a total 360 change in that relationship. <br /><br />Two favorite parts of Breaking:<br /><br />1) When Sal bugs Walts house and he finds out and confronts him at the office and Walts going off and he starts yelling and he&#039;s like &#039;I&#039;m down! No more cooking!&#039; and Sals like &#039;Oh boo-hooo I&#039;m such a cry baby! I don&#039;t wanna cook meth no more.&#039;<br /><br />2)Other one is when Walt gets canned for trying to sex up the principal and Jess was outside waiting. They get into a fight cause Jess cooked up the blue and Walt got pissed cause it was actually good and he felt threanted but yeah just the whole exhange during that is easily in my top 5 favs. Another important thing in that scene is that they just sit in the school parking lot. Before Walt was so paranoid&nbsp; with meetings with Jesse and no one could see or know. I think at that scene the shift started from Walter White to Heisenberg.
