				Lately a lot of Australian buyers have been complaining about the high price of drugs on SR.<br />All I wanna say is that if you can get them cheaper IRL, then go and get them. Don&#039;t say you can get them cheaper from a vendor O/S unless YOU ACTUALLY DO, you&#039;re obviously too gutless to ship international or lack the feduciary capacity in general to use drugs.<br />Not aimed directly at you Seigfried Stardust, though your comments contributed to my starting this post.<br />If you want to resell what you get on SR thats fine, but drugs aren&#039;t free and every degree of separation, from initial supplier to end user, gets a mark up. It&#039;s the way drugs are, have always been and always will be. <br /><br />Sorry that this doesn&#039;t suit generation WHYME, blame your parents, they&#039;ve let you take instant gratification for granted.

				I can get everything I can get here in real life. Also of similar or better quality, but it ain&#039;t cheap.<br /><br />I agree with Shiz, the domestic prices on here are generally on par, if not slightly more expensive than what I would pay in real life.<br /><br />But indeed if you&#039;re getting proper quality it&#039;s worth paying top dollar.<br /><br />No one on here has the right to complain about prices, if you don&#039;t like the price, don&#039;t buy it... how easy is that. Whiny teenagers complaining because there McDonalds wage wont cover the cost... shut the fuck up.... <br /><br />I mean c&#039;mon you have the ability to order a plethora of high quality drugs straight to your letter box, without leaving the comfort of your computer chair, I think that in itself is worth paying a premium for. <br /><br />It&#039;s the internationals that make this place worth every penny though, in my true opinion, although I&#039;ll splash on some domestic if I&#039;ve got coins left are care for something cheap and quick...<br /><br />But good god, the return you can make on imported quality powders is incredible. I mean fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

				I half agree Shiz, maybe 75% agreeance, the prices here for a lot of things are definitely in line with domestic street prices, but some stuff is substantially cheaper!<br />Try getting a g of uncut YaYo anywhere in Aus for less than $200!

				Additionally, some users might be looking at the wrong offers. The smaller more frequent buys are often slightly more expensive than street, but when purchasing in bulk here prices drop substantially. When purchasing the smaller orders, whenever I convert out to USD, it almost always comes out to exact street price or few dollars more, and not many dollars more at that. <br />Let me ask, can you find 82% pure MDMA in the your area for less than 50 a gram? I can, if I purchase directly from a local chemist. But do you have that luxury? Plus for the convenience factor of getting something dropped of to you without waiting for some tripped out chemist to answer his phone, I&#039;d pay the extra 5.<br />Basically you aren&#039;t just paying more, you are getting more, improved reliability, improved anonymity, and if you are willing, cheaper bulk listings.<br /><br />-Cheers

				People have every right to to complain. Some of these guys are delusion or just straight out ripping people off. Keep them honest.<br /><br />eg Selling 1 Ritalin 10mg for $55, thing isnt worth $5.<br /><br />Quite a few of these prescription drugs that you can get on the street cheap as chip, or import bulk at very cheap prices from quite a few safe countries, are way over priced here.&nbsp; LSD is another one, easy to import and better quality and potency from OS.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I have been in this game for over 20 years.<br /><br />It is clowns like you that let these rip off merchants stay in business. What I am stating is market value, what you are buying at is inflated market value because a) You are kid that dosnt any better b) You are a pussy who lets people rip them off to their face.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I strongly recommend Australian&#039;s dont buy LSD, NBOMe etc from Australian vendors, blotter paper will get through customs without a problem. . Not to mention you will have better chance of getting actual LSD and stronger potency from OS.<br /><br />All prescription tabs will get in easy too from certain countries.&nbsp; Another product where jew aussie vendors think they can make you pay $10 for every one of $1 of theirs.<br /><br />I think any from 50% - 100% markup is great profit in the drugs trade.Aussie vendors with their jew like 1000% mark up, I think anything from 50% to 100% is fair markup, but these jew cunts want to charge TEN TIMES the price<br /><br />Make the aussie vendors with ridiculous markups your absolute last resort, only when you&#039;re very desperate and only buy absolute minimum. When you want to buy something check the international prices, if it is more than double, dont be chump and make some jew cunt rich.<br /><br />I would like to see more aussies import and then even sharing their imports with other aussies rather than being held to ransom to few that are just greedy jews, we could have a real good community here if people stopped sucking cocks dealers who rob people blind to try and get the odd freebie etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				$500 is a rip off to you!!<br />Why because you can buy it for $2 a gram?<br />I bet those chinese folk selling it to you for 2 bucks a gram feel they are ripping you off!! &quot; if that round eye wants to pay $2 per g for us to ship it to him we aint gonna say no!!&quot;<br /><br />No $500per g sounds about right to the person who doesnt want to fuck around. Paypal some cunt in india or china... pfft&nbsp; $500 bucks sounds perfect for the convenience and not being so exposed. <br /><br />$250 for coke? you happy with that??? you can buy a 8BALL cheaper than you can buy a can of coke... in Columbia<br /><br />Why are we having these discussions STILL? Im not out to protect anybodies interest. I just cannot believe for the life of me how anyone can come on here and say a vendor is ripping people off. <br /><br />OMFG dont buy beer!!&nbsp; Holy shit the markup... enough to call ACA and complain I reckon<br />Im dribbling shit again shizzle?<br />

				damn straight.<br />There is no way I would buy a beer for $3 when I can make it for .20c<br />I dont give a fuck what you want to pay for it but you will never hear me cry &#039; you are getting RIPPED OFF!!&#039;<br />You wont see the average person starting a picket line down at the local crying RIPPED OFF do you??<br /><br />And yes an 8 ball is cheaper because you are at the source...that is the point.<br /><br />&quot;Average price expectancy&quot; of a commodity like drugs is mute.<br />Whos price expectancy? yours? mine? because my expectancy is for free drugs... but the reality is, if I want it, I have to pay the asking price or fuck off quietly.<br /><br />IMO voicing your opinions on the price of drugs is useless. Dont buy it and go elsewhere. Dont you have a cheaper alternative? Because it sounds like you are just upset because you dont have a choice.<br />If a vendor cant sell the product at a price, the vendor will have to drop the rate to sell it because it is obviously too dear. If the vendor sells it at the price, your expectancy of what the price should be...is off<br />All this bitchin will get you nowhere.<br />Please dont take me as being a prick about this. I am just saying how I see it. <br />I want more coke but the &quot;price expectancy&quot; is still too high for me to form a nice little habit. So I will just chew my coca leaf and shut the fuck up.

				Wow!! I am sooo thankful i live where i live. In the good ole U.S.of A. Where on the west coast the drug cartels are flooding the streets with H and Cocaine. Marijuana is legal in most states here for medical use, so there are legal growers everywhere producing what you guys call &#039;hydro&#039;. If you have a weed card you can go legally to the weed store and buy the finest nugz grown on earth for 10$ a gram. Illegally an oz of straight nugz is about 140$( i know its cheaper than purchasing legally). THere is no such thing as sticks and stems here. Cocaine is 50-80$ a gram ( and this is pearlescent fish scale).All the H is tar, and ranges around 80$ a gram. ( this really varies in quality though depending on the demand of your area, in mine its really good and we are experiencing a heroin epidemic with hundreds of od&#039;s every year). I figured you aussies would have killer china white from the region above you in asia and afganistan. E-Tabs(we call them rolls here) are from 5-10$ apiece and these are not dxm shit, they are real mda or mdma. I really feel for all you freethinking individuals in Australia who like to use mind altering substances to enhance (or escape) their reality. You guys have incredibly steep prices. I believe in better living through chemistry. <br />Regards,<br />Nash Rambler

				We pay more because of a lot of things.<br />IMO<br />We are an island after all and getting things here in bulk through our &quot;shitty customs&quot; is one factor.<br />Sure they may get 9/10 kgs of coke through... but they will make you pay for the losses. The more they catch the more expensive it becomes when it hits the streets.<br /><br />Aussies are use to paying more but as places like SR pop up and become popular, we will see more competition, especially on personal use amounts. Only for those that want to do the dirty work and import themselves.<br /><br />Demand is higher than supply. Take cannabis. In the case that you fail to live somewhere remotely close to&nbsp; the SA/ Northern NSW belt where every man and his dog is growing weed, you will pay more. Its hard to believe but supply is limited and the demand high in some areas. I have seen hydro fetch $500+ per oz come festive season in a drought. <br /><br />Other places also pay as much if not more for drugs. Japan being one of them.&nbsp; Also an island with strict borders. NZ as well<br /><br />There is lots of cash floating around the place in certain parts of Aus. Im doing my part to tell them all about SR;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Or are local dealer or shills for local dealers.
