				Sober too brah. Only drugs I&#039;ve done lately are LSD and nicotine. Trying to kick the cigs this last week with a good bit of success. Caved and bought a pack yesterday though. Ended up giving half of them to some niglet outside the gas station and said happy fucking easter.

Layne was such an amazing musician and his lyrics felt like they touched my soul. <br /><br />Check out Mad Season if you haven&#039;t already. It was different band with Layne singing that only came out with one album before the bassist OD&#039;ed and died and of course Layne was in and out of his hibernation before he totally went off the grid. I think they started in 95 or 96, and 96 is when Layne went recluse and stayed in his apartment and just got smashed until he died.

				I&#039;ve been re-examining DXM for the past 2 weeks. I&#039;m going tripping today (soon).<br />Just FYI, whoever thinks DXM sucks, well it doesn&#039;t. To me it feels solemn and &quot;mystical&quot; (120-200mg [going for 300mg~ today!]) which is exactly the feeling I&#039;ve been looking for all this time.<br />Maybe PCP, K and other dissociatives would be great too.... anyway enjoy your highs/trips everyone :)

				DXM has gotten me the most out of reality messed up feeling I have ever had and I have ate half ounce of mushrooms and smoked DMT.<br /><br />I would do about 800mg though, and that is what my first trip started at too. Talk about not being functional and losing total sense of reality. I went so many places and did so many thing in my head and had no idea I was just sitting motionless for hours. I created a pseudo reality and the scenes would shift all the time. Absolutely nuts.... <br /><br />Not a social drug or something that embodies fun, but an adventure and new look on reality and perspective.

				It felt like I was flying through space when I was totally dissociated. I was traveling through endless corridors, but never reached a destination. <br />Just make sure you only take DXM. I messed up one time and drank a bottle with pseudoephedrine. I had a seizure and was out of my mind for a day. Everything went to plaid before the seizure like in the Spaceballs movie. That is something I won&#039;t do again.

				Had a great time about a year back on pure DXM powder, but it&#039;s something I stay clear of now. Shit&#039;s a little too fun; and to me it&#039;s definitely a drug that takes a good toll on the brain.

				My DXM days are over with, because I think I over did it and it took me a month or so to feel like I was totally in tune with everyone else and reality. I felt weird and slightly disassociated for 3-4 weeks like I was not the same species as everyone else and didn&#039;t want to be around people, because social interaction was so weird more than it already previously was to me.

				Me too. I just didn&#039;t get the same effects after a few trips. I don&#039;t think my brain was ever the same. I have K and MXE now, but I&#039;m just chipping a bump here and there.<br /><br />Datura is a total mind fuck. I tried that a couple times, but never again. The hallucinations were so real I believed them. If anything did permanent damage it was DXM and datura. Both feel far worse for my body and mind than meth.

				Appreciate it JellyLegs. +1 Karma for you. Like I said, I&#039;m in a much calmer state right now because someone on SR offered to help me out big time, and they&#039;re completely saving my ass for no reason other than they&#039;re a good person, and I believe that karma rewards people like that. Karma has already kicked my ass a couple of times, it will certainly do the opposite for people doing the right thing.
