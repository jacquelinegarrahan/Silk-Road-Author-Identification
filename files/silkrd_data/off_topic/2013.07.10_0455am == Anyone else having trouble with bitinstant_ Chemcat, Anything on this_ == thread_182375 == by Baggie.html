				Everytime I click the link on their website to make a transaction it says this..............&quot;We apologize for the inconvenience, but we are unable to process your transaction at this time. Please contact support@bitinstant.com if you have questions.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;???I am sooooo fucking confused!!! The site won&#039;t even allow me the opportunity to make a payment slip! Any problems like this in any of yalls experience?

				Not sure, but making a fake account with 2k allowance per day was the best decision yet.&nbsp; Everything goes smoothly when you have a login, so you should look into it (you will probably have to more or less steal someone&#039;s identity).&nbsp; Random people on facebook with unsecure information who list their whole lives in detail down to the very GPS coordinates of where they live helps.&nbsp; To be fair though, you should tumble the coins so that they don&#039;t get fucked :)
