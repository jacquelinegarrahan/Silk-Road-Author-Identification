				I will soon be beginning a drug manufacturing operation which will net me a decent salary. I plan on laundering this money, but as I am not well versed in the subject of taxes and finances, I would like some advice from those who are. I expect my income to be anywhere from $30,000- $50,000 per year, but it could easily be more. What are the main techniques people laundering this amount use? I do not know anyone who owns a small business suitable for this action, so I would have to start my own. Although I did have (what I thought at least) was a pretty good idea a couple weeks ago; considering I am a musician, would laundering my money through falsified album/singles/merch sales on my website and fake gigs be a viable option? And of course I could always start an indy record label with my home recording studio and generate both clean and dirty money that way. But I digress, this is not my area of expertise, tell me, what are the possible routes I can take for a person in my situation?<br /><br />(Also, any information about taxes for small businesses and the like would also be appreciated, as I definitely don&#039;t want to get audited.)

				Businesses with large cash flow preferably selling services rather than goods. These should be cheap enough so you don&#039;t need records of customers, and this also ensures a probable reason for large cash flow rather than cards, or credit flow if you will.<br /><br />Clipping hair, tattoos, massage, etc. Are traditional ways of doing it.<br /><br />Another way, if you need it fast and easy- is to buy things with cash and sell it online for credit.

Since I&#039;ll be saving most of my earnings anyway, I figured the money that I DO spend would be best laundered that way since it wouldn&#039;t be such exorbitant amounts. And then I&#039;ll just spend the dirty money when the op is shut down and after a bit of time anyway.
