				seriously whats with all the bitcoin mtix buybtc whatever thefucking thing is called its irritatating, a simple script can do it, doesnt sr have programmers on call waiting to be paid in bitcoins and drugs,&nbsp; that was the job description I got =D<br /><br />also people dont post pone them, if anything when you see one go to a topic you have interest and make a post to push if off the newest topics when refreshed.<br /><br />anyway SR I believe you could easily take some effective measures against this, because gd!#@ its irritating

				cut off their flow of income and their spamming will become pointless.<br /><br />put a disclaimer on the bottom of the SR login saying not to buy off anyone spammign the forum or claiming to sell BTC at a cheap price via credit card or paypal. Paypal offer not protection for Digital transfers so you will lose your money.<br /><br />do this, and the problem will resolve itself.

				Workaround = add more mods<br /><br />Fix = have an admin use one of the many tools available to them<br /><br />The real issue is one of perception.&nbsp; If this is supposed to be a secure market that using a crypto-currency and snubs their nose at the law then an amateur spam attack that could be perpetrated by any registered user shouldn&#039;t affect the usability of the site this dramatically without a response by the administrators.&nbsp; The fix is not difficult.
