				If I went interrailing with my friends, stop at Netherlands / Germany and buy some LSD from there, could we still go on to other countries with the goods?<br />How strict are the border customs in the middle Europe? Does anyone have experiences about this ?&nbsp; And at the hostel, how could we order the drugs to our hostel safely?<br /><br />Thanks in advance ! :)

				When I was interrailing with my buddy this summer we went to the Netherlands, I bought a gram of coke and MDMA along with a gram of Maroc Hashish, and I vacuum packed them when we were heading into our next destination, the UK, we went there by ship from Hoek van Holland and what surprised me the most there was absolutely NO control, not when we boarded the ship, and not when we landed, I could have had a brick of coke in my backpack. Only time I have traveled outside of the Netherlands was this way, and at that time I got the goods through. I&#039;m not encouraging to smuggle, but for some weird reason we had no border control. They only asked for passports when we boarded the ship, they didn&#039;t scan our backpacks or anything.<br /><br />Edit: typos

				Interesting!<br />how did you buy the drugs? From the streets or did you order them to your hotel/hostel?<br /><br />I think they should have better border security for people coming from NL, but yeah, good for us :D

				The hash was a left-over from a coffee shop and the MDMA and coke were from the streets, I know it is not adviced to buy from the streets, but it was good shit. It was a funny situation actually, there was a black rastafari standing in a street corner from whom we asked, he got the stuff (not surprised lol) and BAM 1 minute later there were 2839749823 black men surrounding us all with red eyes eating McDonalds ice-cream with caramel sauce trying to sell more coke. So be careful if you attempt the same :P<br /><br />And indeed it was utterly weird that there was no border control, don&#039;t know if they ever have any by ship (which would be quite illogical from UK, it is the Netherlands after all) or if they just forgot it this time or something, no idea.<br /><br />Edit: even more typos -_-

				Most of the European countries are in Shengen zone, which means there are no inner-border controls. Some random checks are possible, but not very common. Although I would still be careful with the drugs.<br /><br />[clearnet] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shengen_zone<br /><br />The UK is not part of it though, I think they should at least check your passport/ID

				LSD is very safe to bring cross borders, especially if it is in the form of tabs. They are just paper, so just put them inside a book at the bottom of your bag, or something along those lines!<br /><br />I brought LSD to a festival in Croatia this Summer and I just put it in my wallet, among a load of receipts and business cards and stuff like that, that tend to accumulate in wallets!

				well that was pretty well done then!<br />I don&#039;t need to travel VIA airlines, luckily. So I think the border controls are not that strict :)<br /><br />Well this is just planning, not even 100% sure about the trip.

				On the track Germany/Netherlands german cops are going through trains (regional trains,ICE,IC and so on ) with dogs but they are mostly looking for hash,<br />speed and pills.They enter the train (depending on the train) on some random station but somewhere&nbsp; after the border.

Dogs definately smell it. If you still plan to do it, hope you get a train which wont be searched.

				On entering the UK by boat or train people of often surprised by the apparent lack of customs officers, but believe me they are there. They tend to uses their methods of profiling for who they chose to stop, and certain people would be flagged when they purchase their ticket in advance. There are of course random stops. If your traveling by foot and have no previous etc. you should be fine. Remember, if you can&#039;t do the time... ;)
