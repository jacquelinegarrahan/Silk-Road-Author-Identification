				Brad Pitt blasts US War on Drugs as &#039;charade&#039; <br />Published: 14 October, 2012, 13:33<br />Edited: 15 October, 2012, 13:23<br /><br />https://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/brad-pitt-war-drugs-387/<br /><br />Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt called on the US government to rethink its 40-year &#039;War on Drugs&#039; policies, saying it “makes no sense.” The 48-year-old movie star addressed the issue while promoting a documentary he produced, just released in the US.<br /><br />The &#039;Fight Club&#039; star was executive producer of Eugene Jarecki&#039;s &#039;The House I Live In,&#039; which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.<br /><br />Before a Los Angeles screening of the film, Pitt gave his take on the America&#039;s drug policy that, according to the documentary, has cost more than $1 trillion and resulted in over 45 million arrests since 1971. US drug policy affects mostly poor and minority communities, and has made America the world’s largest jailer.<br /><br />The documentary also examines how political and economic corruption have fueled these policies for decades, &quot;despite persistent evidence of its moral, economic, and practical failures.&quot;<br /><br />Filmed in more than 20 states, &#039;The House I Live In&#039; shows the perspectives of multiple victims and perpetrators of the War on Drugs, from the dealer to the grieving mother, the narcotics officer to the senator, the inmate to the federal judge.<br /><br />&quot;I know people are suffering because of it. I know I&#039;ve lived a very privileged life in comparison and I can&#039;t stand for it,&quot; Pitt told Reuters, calling US drug policy a &quot;charade.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s such bad strategy. It makes no sense. It perpetuates itself. You make a bust, you drive up profit, which makes more people want to get into it,&quot; he said. &quot;To me, there&#039;s no question; we have to rethink this policy and we have to rethink it now.&quot;<br /><br />

				I too was looking for the movie months ago when I heard it won Sundance. I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s a preview of the movie on Youtube, but I&#039;d have no issue with paying if the money goes to an anti-prohibition cause anyway. <br />&nbsp;Awesome work as well by Brad Pitt, using his spotlight to ask for a change in drug policy. The war on drugs is a failure and celebrities like Brad Pitt and Joe Rogan, Pat Robertson, etc help to expedite popular opinion to an overwhelming majority against the war on drugs, making it a &quot;safe&quot; political topic. As it stands, we&#039;re probably looking at a 50/50 split in opinion, a taboo topic for politicians,&nbsp; but with more endorsement and unfortunately, more people&#039;s family getting affected by drug laws, politicians will be able to curry favor by promising an end to the drug war.

				It&#039;s not that governments don&#039;t understand that their drug policy is self defeating, it&#039;s that no government can be seen to succumb to a more tolerant set of drug laws. The voting public as a whole respond to tough sounding rhetoric when it comes to drugs and liberalisation of drug laws will come across as defeatist and weak. So the better option is to continue to talk tough no matter how little impact one is having. They simply have no alternative until the voting public allow them to roll out a plan B....and we are a million miles away from having a consensus around the liberalisation of drug policy. The vast majority of people just want the security of knowing that the government id acting and talking tough in relation to drugs.

				I can&#039;t watch, read, or hear about anything relating to the war on drugs anymore. No matter which side it&#039;s on, they make me feel hopeless and upset. <br /><br />I love silk road for that reason. It is a blatant slap in the face to lawmakers. I hold vendors to a very high standard on silk road, and that is because I want the best for this silly underground drug market. That can&#039;t happen without the key ingredient: reliable vendors. Hopefully as the number of quality vendors and buyers grows, it will cause a larger impact upon society. Hopefully it causes violence to decrease in the inner city, since as a vendor it&#039;s hard to kill your competitors or rob others of product. Also, hopefully it causes a decrease in arrests, since buying drugs online is significantly less likely to land you in jail than scoring or dealing on the street. Not to mention safer. Also, due to the collaboration between users of the site, it allows people to help weed out poor, contaminated samples and to allow people to get a good idea of a products purity before using, increasing the safety of drugs all together.<br /><br />I saw a quote from someone not too long ago about silk road:<br />&quot;Came for the drugs, stayed for the revolution.&quot;<br /><br />Bit of an off topic rant, I know.

				Right ok, I will concede that the punishment etc is skewed that is fairly obvious to all but my underlying point is that really, it&#039;s never going to change because the way it is feeds too many people. I have just got to the point where I see this argument and debate go around in circles so many times I don&#039;t give a fuck about it anymore and it just annoys me. The status quo is as it is and I can make money from it (along with anyone else who sells drugs) so I just don&#039;t care anymore. The whole thing reminds me why I don&#039;t really care about people and why I donate to animal charities. <br /><br />I used to be idealistic about all this but I just realized being so really doesn&#039;t get you far and you always end up being disappointed.

Regardless of whether or not you want to be a part of it or agree with the message, you are a part of a revolution.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=54133.msg608126#msg608126">Quote from: Limetless on November 20, 2012, 05:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> Let&#039;s take a recent events into consideration SR going down. We can all be hippies and all for one and one for all while everything is ticking over nicely but as soon as shit gets weird people we&#039;re turning on each other like it was the last days of fucking Rome and this is just a forum. Translate that to real life, times it by 10 and that&#039;s just the nature of the business. It&#039;s dog-eat-dog where people flip for all sorts of reasons and you can&#039;t remove that from it no matter how hard you try.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So are you saying that even if drugs were legal, people would still be killing each other over them? Yeah, I doubt it.<br /><br />You have very negative views of other people. People aren&#039;t always the nicest, and they will do what it takes to watch out for themselves and the people they care about, however I don&#039;t think the world is quite as negative and dog-eat-dog as you seem to think it. People do what&#039;s necessary to survive and thrive, but it doesn&#039;t mean their heartless, and won&#039;t help others out.<br /><br />I think you use this &#039;dog-eat-dog&#039; mentality as a justification for stepping on other people to move yourself ahead. Almost like a preemptive strike. You are too afraid they will step on you to get ahead so you make sure to go ahead and do it first.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol....I think you&#039;re being extremely naive on our first comment.<br /><br />On your second, well I think that you think you know more than you do about someone you have never met haha. Also what exactly needs to be justified about how life works? The world is a competition, free enterprise is competition and really, human existence is competition. You can white wash that with whatever coat of rosy smelling shit you like but it doesn&#039;t change the fact. Your idea that you don&#039;t have to compete in life is just absurd lol, there is always a pecking order in all human social circles whatever they may be. You&#039;re damn right people have to get stepped over so you can get ahead, that&#039;s how progress works. If not we&#039;d all be happy just picking food out of trees and dying at 30. <br /><br />And of course people will still be knocking each other off for drugs, just not in the same way. It wouldn&#039;t take away the crime caused by addiction or the social problems at all, it just hands the production and control from one illegal cartel to a government sponsored one i.e Big Pharma. Well done there mate not only do you have to bow down to the government that I&#039;m sure you so fervently protest against but you have just made them your dealer and instead of having gangs they have bona fide police and soldiers that can act within the law to terrorise you if you get out of line and want more crack than they allow. So yeah, kudos for really making the situation better but I&#039;ll take a few 1000 losses over Brave New World any day of the week because that way I know I&#039;m not a complete drone.

				Couldn&#039;t agree more with Lim&#039;s last couple of posts on this issue. Most things in life have a pecking order in place, from the shit kicker at the bottom to the head honcho at the top. The choice of where you sit in that order is yours to make, influenced by the decisions you make and the effort you put in. As the old saying goes - &quot;If you always do what you&#039;ve always done, you&#039;ll always get what you&#039;ve always got&quot;. <br />

I&#039;m sure most SR users are aware of what Portugal did but you can quickly find many articles discussing the improvements they&#039;ve seen since. Interestingly the fact that Portugal did this is something that most mainstream media has never covered and doesn&#039;t mention at all so most people aren&#039;t aware of it.<br />I think there will be a big change within the next generation or two. Most older people have very ignorant and misinformed views of drugs that they aren&#039;t willing to re-think whereas younger people are more open to discussion about the issue.<br />I am now going to look up how the Portuguese government did it and how the people initially responded.

The voting public as a whole respond to tough sounding rhetoric when it comes to drugs and liberalisation of drug laws will come across as defeatist and weak. So the better option is to continue to talk tough no matter how little impact one is having. They simply have no alternative until the voting public allow them to roll out a plan B....and we are a million miles away from having a consensus around the liberalisation of drug policy. The vast majority of people just want the security of knowing that the government id acting and talking tough in relation to drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is no excuse for America&#039;s rampet abuse; other than people are spending huge amounts on lawyer fees(system) and not on hits(direct action);&nbsp; wen a policeman is dead,&nbsp; no longer can he search your pockets; that&#039;s what I call putting an End to the Drug War. Pussies; go fuck yourselves, stop framing abuse as valid; it&#039;s Mal-practice. KILL COPS, simple. then you get rid of them from your society because they are the source of Evil; America is easily the most pathetic society when it comes to being privileged slaves; they have been inoculated to their own demise &amp; don&#039;t mash brains in correspondence, then American&#039;s wouldn&#039;t hide behind their fake egotistical esotericism; as they&#039;d be respected round the globe.
