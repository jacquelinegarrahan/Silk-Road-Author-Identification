				no drugs should be illegal. they should all be regulated. then we get what we pay for and don&#039;t have to worry about snorting crushed glass or whatever, the government gets more taxes to deal with the addicts (much like alcoholics), the prisons would actually be able to cope with the amount of REAL criminals and basically EVERYONE&#039;s happy 8)

				I sadly have a friend in jail just now for taking someones life while driving under the influence of a controlled substance, he has served 2 out of his 7 years.<br /><br />So when an addict commits a crime harming another person, this would result in them being treated by criminal punishment instead of treatment?

				yeah i think that sounds logical enough. possessing/taking drugs should not be a crime, but if you perform a criminal act while on them (again using alcohol as an example - if you are pissed up and start a fight, you will invariably be arrested for affray/GBH/ABH/whatever) then you should of course be punished

				yeah i think it would be the same as alcohol (well it is just another drug isn&#039;t it) - you&#039;d have to have a licensed premises for punters to consume on the premises, like pubs and dutch coffee shops. not sure about supermarkets though. i suppose they&#039;d be behind the counter like cigarettes, but like alcohol they can only be sold during certain hours (stupid law if you ask me, but better than not at all!)<br /><br />not sure about production, obviously synthetic drugs wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but stuff from a natural base - coke, H, even pot, might be difficult due to our shitty weather. saying that we have hemp fields in the UK at the moment. opium wouldn&#039;t be a problem i don&#039;t think - i&#039;ve seen and heard of gardens full of opium poppies in the UK, but i think a special rig would be needed if we were to start growing coca in the UK, probably massive greenhouses or something, and probably under very tight security in very secret locations to stop people raiding them. would it be cheaper to ship bulk coca leaves over from SA and then process them here than actually grow it here?

				No drugs or substances should be illegal. Anybody that argues this is either too emotionally involved with a troubling personal incident, or is a complete buffoon that has terrible logical reasoning skills. Enough of this debate, legalize everything! If you disagree, state your case and I will consider it and rebuff your stance if appropriate.

				Pretty sure all the natural plants mentioned can be grown indoors in lab conditions no bother, if this is cost effective or not would depend on market values, My guess is yes it would be financially possible. Just look at the UK weed market for indoor, prices are only get higher and people will pay.<br /><br />So would home production for personal consumption be legal?<br /><br /><br />

				it probably would require a license, but i can&#039;t see how licensing/registering home meth labs or similar could be enforced - yes a lot of law-abiding citizens WOULD get it licensed/registered, but for every 1 that does there will be 5 that doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />even if all drugs were legal there would still be a criminal element that bypassed the laws and restrictions.<br /><br />even in this highly hypothetical discussion there appears to be grey areas...

				In my vision of a perfect world, you would be able to walk down to your nearest convenience store and buy a drug with your groceries. Every drug ought to be legal, and just like anything else you put in your body, have &quot;nutrition facts&quot; of sorts, telling you the proper dosage for your age/weight and potential risks involved in taking them.

It was a bitch for a while watching my friends smoke while I was cutting back to 5 a day... 4 a day... 3 a day... Then I had enough weed to smoke every day and I just quit cigs altogether.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had friends who have overcome, all on their own, addictions to pills and DXM. One in particular used to take cocktails of pills, figuring out which blends he liked and taking a fistful. He fought it off. Another was off and on with DXM for a while, but when he decided he was done he finally quit for good.<br /><br />Dealing with addiction is a bitch, no denying that. But it can be done, it can in fact be avoided altogether unless you&#039;re just not careful, and so any harm to the user that comes from a drug, including addiction, is not cause for it to be illegal. Not anymore than mountain climbing should be illegal because if you&#039;re not careful it will kill you, to use the classic drugs to climbing comparison.

				My opinion is based on how it affects other people. If you take a drug that is going to completely fuck with you,&nbsp; then i don&#039;t think it should be illegal, we should have a right to do to our bodies as we wish. This changes when, for example PCP, makes you go around eating peoples faces off. However, people NEED to be educated on this, to save some 11 year old&#039;s dieing because they don&#039;t know how much/what it is they are taking. Although, If some of the hardcore/addictive+dangerous drugs&nbsp; (Meth, heroine, that German shit that almost kills you, etc.) or something that will kill you should be so easily available, its a mass murder waiting to happen.Give a kid a pill saying it will make him feel better, when it kills him. (Unless, this was his intention)<br /><br />Man my English is terrible, fucked on quite a lot atm aha 8)<br />Locker.

				@greengiant<br /><br />The kid wouldnt areal the weed because he cant sell it because every one who smokes has a plot dedicated to it in. their yard.<br /><br />Synthetics would be mass produced and dirt cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />People would be less likely to do addictive drugs because of easily found cheap alternatives.<br /><br />People could experiment, poor drugs would lose market share because the free market decides what is made by what sells.<br /><br />The money saved from not filling jail cells with drug users/dealers and fielding in country armies and spies would pay for free treatment to those who desire it.&nbsp; You can&#039;t force an addict to get clean, you must wait until they choose to, then welcome them with open arms, not loaded guns.<br /><br />Cocaine can&#039;t be grown aty low altitudes. But south america could supply the world cheaply.&nbsp; Cocaine = dirty cheap.<br /><br />Basically I think all drugs would be on the dollar menu for a days supply or more.<br /><br />As for people dying, again the market decides this. Why would jonny 14 year old take something that kills him and is addictive if product x does the same thing without the risk or addiction and is right next to it in the shelf? The market would force the harmful product off the shelf by not selling.<br /><br />Also, kids have rights too, to deny them the basic rights because of a subjective number is more harmful than drugs.&nbsp; We are not property, ever.<br /><br />Current addicts might face issues, but the world must change with our without them.<br /><br />As for krokadile, it is very bad, but junkies only use it because they have no access to what they actually want. It would not exist on the market if other, better products were available.

				I personally believe that everybody should have the right to decide what they do and do not want in their body. If a person chooses to do drugs, they&#039;re going to do them regardless of the laws in-place. Regulated drugs would result in cleaner products and probably, in the future, healthier drugs with recreational benefits (seeing as companies would probably like to get in-on the huge profit opportunity that would arise if drugs were legal). Damage reduction research would be done.

				i dont think i can say much now that hasn&#039;t been said but basically i agree with everything Raoul Duke has said.......<br /><br />All drugs legal now! Treat addicts or people acting up on drugs in the same manner as un-ruley drunks or alcoholics as said. If we kept people in supply of good drugs, then shit like Krokodil would probably never exist.<br /><br />too many people that are still blind to the truth though, and they are still gonna need some convincing!!<br /><br />great thread of discussion though OP the GG....still gotta check out your budder/oils!!! ;)
