				Put it in a baggie and put that baggie into an airtight box with lots of desiccant. If the box is transparent, store it in a dark place.

				MDMA will keep for years and years, decades even.&nbsp; Just keep it in a cool, dry, preferably dark place.&nbsp; Dessicant is a good idea, as Ballz mentioned.&nbsp; No need to keep it cold.&nbsp; Even in a hot home or apartment it will be fine as long as you keep it dry.&nbsp; Amphetamine salts tend to be very stable.<br /><br />MAPS&#039;s supply was made in the 80s by David Nichols, and they are still using it for their research today.

				yeah if you have an unused vitamin container you can probably use that too put it in a ziplock baggie and then inside the container which usually comes with a desiccant and you can just store it somewhere (cupboard, draw) where it won&#039;t come in contact with heat and you&#039;re good to go.

				MDMA.is a phenethylamine.<br /><br />In general, the phenethylamines class are quite stable molecules. <br /><br />Shulgin once remarked that if MDMA had existed in the time of the pharaohs and buried in the pyramids, it would still be good today.<br /><br />However he is referring to unadulterated MDMA only. <br /><br />Storage: In a cool, dry and closed container.<br /><br />Avoid: Direct Sunlight, Heat and Water<br /><br /><br />

				Yeah you guys are way better at this than I am... the only way I could keep a bag of MDMA around for the summer would be to get hooked on Meth...

				Pure (80%+) MDMA is pretty difficult to compromise. The stuff in pills can lose potency and structural integrity if stored incorrectly (warm and damp). <br />

				Hey Ballz (and rest of thread) what is the storage protocol for storing ketamine and dmt?<br /><br />I just keep everything in my fridge but I was curious if there were any substances that don&#039;t like the cold?

DMT is pretty stable from what I&#039;ve read, especially in salt form. Freebase I&#039;d store in an air-tight container in a fridge.<br />I&#039;ve never heard of any drug that is damaged by low temperatures but if you do store them in a fridge, do so in an air-tight, waterproof container. The reason behind this is that when you take them out of the fridge, the cold drugs will attract lots of moisture from the air so leaving them in a waterproof container until they&#039;ve warmed up is a good idea.
