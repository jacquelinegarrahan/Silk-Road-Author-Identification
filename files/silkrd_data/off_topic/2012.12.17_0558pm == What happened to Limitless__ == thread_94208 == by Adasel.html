				No problem, TreeSpirit. It was somebody else that was asking after ML books. IMAHO, questions like that often raise a red flag anyway. This week has been the worst. I thought the back-and-forth too funny to waste, so I wanted to cut a couple of words from one of the posts, then Limetless removed the post in question. TY for that. (btw, Limilesses friend you spelt Limetless wrong..... ) Oh crap, so did I. (Jesus! It&#039;s also spelt wong on the lottery page as well.)<br /><br />brb (just ordered pizza) Where was I? <br /><br />The whole thread in question seems to have now been deleted, according to a thread by SilentMaverick whoever that is.&nbsp;
