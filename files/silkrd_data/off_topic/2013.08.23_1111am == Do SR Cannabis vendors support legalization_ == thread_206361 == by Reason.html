				Hi All!<br /><br />It certainly seems like Cannabis legalization advocates are starting to make real progress in the last few years.&nbsp; Washington State and Colorado, are now on the road for full legalization by January 2014.&nbsp; Uraguay is going to be the first Nation that will fully endorse legal weed.<br /><br />If this continues, who knows.<br /><br />This is thrilling to me (certainly a long time advocate), but it occurs to me that many of our wonderful SR Cannabis vendors might not be so enthusiastic.&nbsp; <br /><br />So my question to them is, do you support it?&nbsp; What would it mean for you?&nbsp; What would you do afterwards?&nbsp; Importantly, how could your long time loyal clients help if that does come to pass (we owe you that much!).<br /><br />R.

				I hope they support legalization. <br /><br />I know I would still use SR. A lot of people are looking at legalization as a potential source of revenue and tax the shit out of it. If that&#039;s what it takes to get it passed then fine, but that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m interested in paying a tax that I don&#039;t have to. If i was a tobacco smoker, I&#039;d get my cigs from those mail order eastern Europe suppliers too.

This goes for all drugs too. The effects aren&#039;t as specific as alcohol, everyone truly reacts differently - in such a manner that one person could be knocked on his ass while another could be completely great.<br /><br />I feel that in order for things to become truly legal, we might need some more studies done in order to truly identify the very specific effects, as well as identify methods for testing whether or not someone is driving under that influence. I don&#039;t like the fact that they use a drug test right now that basically turns out positive if you&#039;d done it in the last week, even though while driving you were sober as a nun.<br /><br />True freedom is a long ways away, and true freedom is something that isn&#039;t going to be the same for everyone. While we might want to be able to do any stupid thin we choose, there will have to be some compromise... particularly in the face of public safety.

				I feel that legalization of cannabis along with all other drugs is a long time coming. i mean its&nbsp; not going to happen in the uk for sure, it seems to get more and more strict there. however somewhere like portugal which has decriminalised all drugs meaning that all users arent persecuted rather dealers are tackled. I think its down to personal choice with all drugs, i mean it wouldnt stop SR due to a black market demand and it would likely deter kids and stop glamourising drugs as much.

				Thanks to you all for such thoughtful replies.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m taken aback that so many of you feel that Cannabis legalization is not coming sooner rather than later.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m an optimist.&nbsp; I even saw that a prominent politician in Canada (Treudeu) recently admitted to using weed &quot;after&quot; he got into office.&nbsp; That is a real indicator of how the wind is blowing if you as me.<br /><br />But back to the point, in my mind if it is legalized, even if it&#039;s taxed highly, I&#039;d not expect many people to continue to use SR for purchasing it.<br /><br />For one, there&#039;s the ever present fear of being busted, and that is a pretty strong deterent (when compared to walking down the street and purchasing it legally).&nbsp; Secondly, I&#039;d expect that an above-groud market would allow consumers greater opporunity to compare quality, price, etc.&nbsp; Here on the SR, it&#039;s much harder to window shop...it really is a buyer beware scenario.&nbsp; Finally the regulations would give consumers some confidence that the product has not been adulterated with&nbsp; pesticides or has mold, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />However...as long as there is something that big brother doesn&#039;t want you to have or know and you want to have or know it... there will surely be a Silk Road you can travel to get it.&nbsp; &nbsp;
