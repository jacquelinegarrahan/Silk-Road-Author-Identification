				This post will be reposted over and over again everyday once they delete it. Once they delete my account, I will post with other accounts. This won&#039;t go away guys.<br /><br />I have been attacked by a group of users on here for posting the conclusion that there is a group of LE on here buying packages from real vendors like me so they can A) pinpoint where we send from, B) snatch packages, C) trash our feedback and then D) sell the stolen drugs as vendors themselves. <br /><br />The shitstorm really came when I accused the top vendors of being cops themselves since they had not yet fallen victim to this tactic. Ironically, right after I accused the top vendors of being cops, my old bad feedback was removed, and Uniwiz claimed I hacked SR and removed it myself. Obviously, if I could hack SR, I wouldn&#039;t even be making this post, I&#039;d just delete their accounts. But anyone who has followed Uniwiz on here knows he&#039;s full of shit anyway.<br /><br />No regular customer would attack me for pointing out a suspicion of LE on here. Only cops would be upset that I exposed their game. Doesn&#039;t anyone wonder why some drugs are so expensive on here? Because cops don&#039;t know street prices.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that the original thread that started the feud has disappeared as well - the one where I proved that buyers williamgates and Diss0lve coordinated an LE purchase from me. It used to be here:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5418.0<br /><br />It&#039;s gone now though. Guess you can&#039;t have Mr Dank exposing your shill buyers. In fact, Limetless just deleted my post where I list them too. They really are trying to hide something, people.<br /><br />so here is a list of fake LE buyers, fake LE vendors, and douchebag mods covering for them:<br /><br />cerealbox<br />Diss0lve<br />Gary Oak<br />Holly<br />Kappucino<br />LIMETLESS<br />Qwerfdsa<br />Oppyate<br />PharmaKarma<br />phubaiblues<br />Rocker (good stuff, but its from the evidence room)<br />Shocky<br />Sobchak<br />TrustusJones<br />Uniwiz<br />williamgates<br /><br /><br />I pointed out Rocker&#039;s stats might be BS because the SMASHED WEED HE SELLS WOULD NEVER GET 5 OF 5 FROM EVERYONE - certainly not anyone in an MMJ state and certainly not with all the buyer trolls who he seems to magically avoid. They argued about it until they realized I was right, and that smashing weed makes it less potent and more like schwag. If you can find the thread, DigitalAlch gave the scientific breakdown of how smashing trichomes ruins weed.<br /><br />

I didn&#039;t attack you, did I? In fact, I was intrigued. I PMed you and asked you what evidence you had. You replied, not with any evidence, or a line of reason, or a basic logical induction of how you came to your conclusions, but instead simply by saying &quot;you obviously don&#039;t know LE do you?&quot;<br /><br />How strange. According to you, I know LE very very well. <br /><br />Sitting here, in my house, with my drug stash right next to me, after a night of taking blow.. I am struck with the fact that you are either some kind of man-child that gets his kicks from trolling, or you are a person with serious mental deficiencies (and in any case I think the latter is probably also true). How you managed to front up a vendors fee from the comfy seat of your wheelchair without your dialysis machine getting in the way is WELL beyond me. <br /><br />Your accusations are entirely unfounded, at least in anything like a feasible reality, and your delusions are out in the open.<br /><br />People have asked you for evidence again and again and again. And yes, LE are probably here, and yes, LE have sold drugs in the past, and yes.. LE does some shady fucking shit. But you know what? If we&#039;re going to identify members of law enforcement here, it&#039;s going to be by an intelligent process of data and behavioural analysis and steady, calm logic - and your fanatical pronouncements of apparent knowledge, coupled with your delusory dismissal of anyone that criticises you as LE, are NOTHING like intelligent, nothing like analytical, and nothing like steady. <br /><br />What you celebrate is the fetishization of conspiracy, and the mad avoidance of responsibility and reality, that if we are ever to identify LE, we MUST maintain. <br /><br />You are a fucking moron, and a shit stain on this community. <br /><br />Fuck off.<br /><br /><br />

				I heard that a group of cops will mix &amp; cut every drug with Zyanide to kill all drug users.If all drug users are dead, all problems with drugs and addiction are away.<br />I also heard that some vendors are Aliens, and if you order drugs they never arrive because they only want your delivery adress to visit you and kidnapp you.<br />Than the Aliens harvest the brains of the kidnapped guys, to extract drugs from the addicted brains to sell them here.

He must live a pathetic existence, if this is how he gets his kicks. Sitting there, laughing at his own imaginary brilliance.<br /><br />Dank, I&#039;m trying to help you here. Seriously, go out, and sign up for some hobbies. Learn an instrument or something. Try and mingle with people and socialise, and develop relationships. I appreciate that you were probably molested as a child and I&#039;m sorry for that but you need to move on. First, I think you should get over your speech impediment. I recommend singing classes or joining a local choir. <br /><br />This will also help you put yourself out there and start making friends. I would start jogging as well to lose some weight, and put yourself on a paleo diet - you will feel healthier and it may help you with your diabetes. <br /><br />I honestly feel sorry for you, that you are driven to these games and pathetic moments to revel, if only briefly, in your distorted self image. <br /><br />If you begin to socialise with people and build some meaningful relationships, then hopefully within a decade you may become something approaching a real person. You never know, you might even be able to work at Subway within a few years. I&#039;m sorry for your predicament Dank, I wish you the best, and I hope it turns out okay for you. <br /><br />I am going to start a charity fund for you Dank, to help you pay for your diabetes medication and a new wheelchair as well as a better functioning dialysis machine. You need a helping hand.

				So let me get this straight. You, who seem to piss off everyone in any thread you post in under one of your many accounts, assume a bunch of vendors, many of who are selling small amounts for personal use, are shipping these from evidence rooms to the same customers repeatedly without busting these buyers at all. Yea, that seems likely.<br /><br />You&#039;re a Super Troll, and quite good at it apparently since I rarely respond to troll posts. But let&#039;s assume for a fraction of an instant that you are correct then considering not all of those legit and quite good vendors you listed ship from the US then they must be in some sort of mega underground police force run by the UN or some other organization able to get away with shipping legit drugs to massive amounts of people from a large number of different countries?<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe, these vendors are like everyone else and are just simply tired of all your crackpot bullshit accusations that never have any proof of any kind to back them up.

You, who seem to piss off everyone in any thread you post in under one of your many accounts, assume a bunch of vendors, many of who are selling small amounts for personal use, are shipping these from evidence rooms to the same customers repeatedly without busting these buyers at all. Yea, that seems likely.<br /><br />You&#039;re a Super Troll, and quite good at it apparently since I rarely respond to troll posts. But let&#039;s assume for a fraction of an instant that you are correct then considering not all of those legit and quite good vendors you listed ship from the US then they must be in some sort of mega underground police force run by the UN or some other organization able to get away with shipping legit drugs to massive amounts of people from a large number of different countries?<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe, these vendors are like everyone else and are just simply tired of all your crackpot bullshit accusations that never have any proof of any kind to back them up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Umm...just google &quot;Cops caught stealing drugs&quot; and you&#039;ll see there are thousands of stories of cops stealing AND selling drugs all over the world. It&#039;s their nature to steal, and basic nature to want to sell for a profit.<br /><br />The main people pissed off are the people who feel this exposes them. No one else has a reason to be pissed off. Have a nice day! :)

				In response to this thread, I personally don&#039;t see how a cop could be a mod.... A Vendor? sure, thats possible. But I think LE would be more focused on taking the Site down, and tracking its owners and workers. Most of us are small fish, and just buy personal amounts of drugs. So i guess, im not seeing the benefit of busting small time crime like 1g of coke, or half an oz of chronic. <br /><br />But opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and most of them stink. lol

				Just my 2 cents there SHOULD be an active open ongoing discussion of suspected LE vendors/buyers/activity. Sure people falsely called out might be butt hurt at first,but hey if you&#039;re not LE than it&#039;s like water off a ducks back.Anyone ever make that 1st walk into a big time cartel connected dealers&#039; and immediately had gun at your head,pat down for wires,guns basically had the fear put in ya? On the streets its harder to gain &quot;cred&quot; and &quot;rep&quot; and much harder to fake or dispute. We are all anonymous and can say and do whatever behind that veil. I have NO DOUBT in my mind that LE has infiltrated SR as vendors buyers and forum accts and will continue to do so. Some,as part of legit ops,and some as rogue cops who wanna get high or make bank. Simple as that. I mean,if you were a sociopath LEO wouldn&#039;t you seize an opportunity such as SR to make a come up? And I will say this...at least 2 MAYBE 3 of the names on danks list are accurate. I won&#039;t name names because one of the best ways to deal with LE when you discover them in your organization is not necessarily to expose them right off,but slowly feed them disinfo and flip the script on em and see how deep the infestation goes and what they know so far. This aint comin from some 19yr olds theoretical &quot;oh im so smart just do this&quot; This is from real world key slangin border crossin high stakes fed indictment type shit from the past. Trust your intuition fellow silkroaders-I know I&#039;m not the only one who has sensed something in the air-top tier vendors going awol,(TV,Dro,PC)(with no forum chatter about it either-QUITE strange)new vendors popping up that just seem kinda &quot;off&quot;....Plus no word from DPR or Nomad in a quite a bit.....but I guess LIMETLESS will keep us informed if the shit hits the fan. Don&#039;t get too complacent dudes-it&#039;s like in consumer pc repair-peoples comps will be totally fucked zombied trojaned rooted the whole 9yards-but as long as they can still do the things they normally do with it they either think there is no problem or dont do anything to fix it until its too late.......

				Why remove it? The whole point Mr Derogatory (Mr Dank) is trying to make is that we&#039;ll delete it creating some confirmation of what he&#039;s saying. <br /><br />Dude. FUCK OFF. You notice, on a daily basis I don&#039;t post much, eh? It&#039;s because stupid fucking twits like you spreading fear and paranoia, baiting troll hunters, and in general lowering the discourse of the forum. You think that were all LE because you had shitty weed, and people said so. You threatened people about there feedback, you trolled into others threads. You are a literal example of what not to be on a forum, and in life. I hope you enjoy that. You be the big fucking idol of what people don&#039;t want to be. <br /><br />I&#039;m so tired of your inane rants, killing your alts, and just seeing your name in general. But, I won&#039;t fall into your trap. I&#039;m not deleting your post, let each one stand as a monument to what&nbsp; an angry, batshit, little prick you are.<br /><br />~Digi <br /><br />

				OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYY DAYYYYYYYYS! So I go away for 4 days for a bit of R+R and time with the fam and I come back and I look! It seems I was left a lovely present rapped up in a gold and diamond bow of loveliness&nbsp; <br /><br />Why is this a present you all may ask? <br /><br />It&#039;s a present because this is just a free pass to rip seven-shades-of-shit out of the most FUNDAMENTALLY FUCK-FACED FAGGOT THAT I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE TO COME ACROSS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM IN MY ENTIRE EVENTFUL LIFE. <br /><br />Let&#039;s pull this apart from the beginning shall we. <br /><br />Numero number fucking UNO - You have waited till I have GONE OFFLINE AND AWAY FOR A FEW DAYS and SAID SO PUBLICLY to create this thread. A thread which, I might add, isn&#039;t even as up to scratch as your usual fucking bullshit. You haven&#039;t even bothered to be creative this time you ass-bandit, you are loosing your touch (even though, let&#039;s face it as a child you were too touched to ever be in touch which you would have to have been to be to become out of touch and then lose your touch) fool. <br /><br />This point raises 2 questions to me, 1 How much of a pussy are you that you need to wait until I go away for the weekend until you do a thread against me? It&#039;s not like I know where you live and I can come round and kick-fuck into you for doing this. All I am saying is that if I scare you THAT much....I am jolly fucking impressed with myself and I&#039;m saying that&#039;s 1-0 to Limetless and +10 badass points. <br /><br />The second question is how immature are you Dank? Am I a cop that plays with my pubes or am I 18 and play with my Ma&#039;s pubes? Seriously? I mean fuck me make some effort, at least when I rip the piss out of you (which I do, and do very well as it happens) I actually bother to make the effort and I generally rip you apart on what you say rather than just finger myself in the arse and pull out brown flecks thinking they are good ideas. Playing with your own shit is what monkeys and 1 year olds do Dank....sort your life out.<br /><br />Numero number fucking DUO! - I think it&#039;s a bit of a testament to how many people here are basically calling you a bullshitting lying shit-stirring, crap-flinging, degenerate little slut you actually are. I mean lets look at the range of people we have here shall we? We have got clients that vouch for me, we got fellow sellers that I chat to on a regular basis, we have people who have nothing to do with me and that I have never spoke to me but just read my posts, we have people that I haven&#039;t done any business with but I just talk on here and finally, we got us a SITE ADMIN who is calling you out for just being a total and utter complete and epic fail of a human being that you actually are. Seriously, if that doesn&#039;t tell you that YOU yes YOU are the one with issues, you must be more blind that someone that was born without eyes. <br /><br />Numero 3....<br /><br />You talk so much bloody shit about your sales. What sales are these may I ask? If you want to make a case of this, let us do this and I&#039;ll compare myself to you. <br /><br />Your transactions come to just over 100 in 1 calender year and you sell what is said to be a high-end product that is highly popular AND you have the American market which is pretty vast because it&#039;s obvious that there are more U.S users on this forum, given that factor it&#039;s safe to hazard a guess that from that there will be more U.S buyer accounts and vendors too. <br /><br />In contrast I sell products that are a bit out of the ordinary (although no less high-end&nbsp; 8)) and tend to be quite niche, the one product that I do have that is more mainstream I&#039;m currently out of stock on and I have been for a couple of weeks. I&#039;m also based in the E.U which means my market is smaller and I don&#039;t get all of the U.S because not everyone wants to shop out of domestic. Even DESPITE all these points, I have still done more sales in 3 months than you have in one year. <br /><br />I&#039;d say that A) this is just a testament to how much you suck mine, and everybody else&#039;s balls. B) You need to stop talking shit about the sales you aren&#039;t actually making. C) You need to get your fucking game face on and start making some sales....you must be broke-as-a-joke. <br /><br />Also if you have an SR sellers account so far as I know you can&#039;t conduct sales outside of the system. So are you getting loads of sales and breaking the SR sellers rules or are you just chatting shit? Please, do tell....<br /><br />Number.....4 <br /><br />Shill accounts. You can&#039;t find people to fight your corner so you create account after account to back your degenerate self up. Fuck my life, you would think that you&#039;d realise that if NOBODY AGREES WITH YOU it&#039;s going to be FOR A REASON and that is because YOU TALK FUCKING SHIT AND YOU ARE SO FAR OUT WEST YOU ARE IN JAPAN! Just because you make people up to agree with you, does not mean people agree with you! And no Dank, I hate to break it to you but imaginary friends do NOT count as real friends....other people have to be able to talk to them without you telling them what they are saying for them to be classed as real. <br /><br />Finally, congrats to all those that made the Dank-hate-list. You are definitely doing something right! <br /><br />Edit - Oh and Ronaldo mate, judging me on what music I like is a little bit baseless. Especially if you are saying that I can&#039;t be that good at ML just because I like Maverick Sabre....really? If you want some lessons shoot me a PM and I&#039;ll show you a thing-or-two. ;)<br /><br />Edit - Oh and over 750 views and only 21 people votes on this bullshit thread (which, some of which were no doubt Dank&#039;s other persona-non-gratis)....must be doing something right.
