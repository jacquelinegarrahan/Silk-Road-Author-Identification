				Experienced smuggler ready on request will fly to destination to consult with the client, at which point i will take possession of the goods that need to be transported. (note:to use this service amounts must be over 1kg) Will travel all over the world smuggling techniques are to a world class standard can take on any amount needed as if need be have the use of a light turboprop aircraft which can be used if the amount is to large to transport on person. The way i work half the money upfront half when i arrive this way we both get what we want.(Note payment is in cash only and when i meet you.) If you are interested list your amount,price and where it needs to be picked up from and go. I will then private message you if im interested in taking up your offer.<br /><br />Many thanks The Preacher.....

				I didn&#039;t know what it was so for others...<br /><br />Jenkem&nbsp; &nbsp; [From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]<br /><br />Jenkem is a purportedly hallucinogenic inhalant created from fermented human waste.[1] In the mid-1990s, it was reported to be a popular street drug among Zambian street children.[2][3][4][5]<br /><br />In November 2007, anecdotal American media reports created the wrong impression that jenkem was a popular drug in American schools. Several sources reported that the increase in American media coverage was based on a hoax and &quot;on faulty Internet research.&quot;<br /><br />&lt;LOL&gt;<br /><br />Description<br /><br />The name derives from Genkem, a brand of glue which had become the generic name for all the glues used by glue-sniffing children in Africa before the manufacturer replaced n-hexane in its ingredients in 2000. ...The making of jenkem is described (as): &quot;fermented human sewage, scraped from pipes and stored in plastic bags for a week or so, until it gives off numbing, intoxicating fumes.&quot; The process is similarly described in a 1995 IPS report: &quot;Human excreta is scooped up from the edges of the sewer ponds in old cans and containers which are covered with a polyethylene bag and left to stew or ferment for a week.&quot; A 1999 BBC article refers to &quot;the dark brown sludge, gathering up fistfuls and stuffing it into small plastic bottles. They tap the bottles on the ground, taking care to leave enough room for methane to form at the top.&quot;<br /><br />&lt;yummy!&gt;<br /><br />:-)

				Aw I was hoping the OP would return here and agree to my proposition. I&#039;m having serious withdrawal symptoms, and the best jenkem comes straight out of the slums of Mumbai.&nbsp; :&#039;(
