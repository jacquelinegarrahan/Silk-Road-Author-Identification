				How does everyone here meet women to date not just to fuck? Especially if your shy and how to keep your work separate from personal life?

				I usually start by being myself, if they no likey...&nbsp; Then they can fuck off.<br /><br /><br />Make sure to let em know that too, it may seem weird but deep down they love that shit.&nbsp; Also, it helps if you have things like hash, and good, clean MDMA, as that will help you stand apart from the rest of the guys who settle for petty things like drinking bud light and chicks with flat asses.<br /><br /><br />Nothing worse then a chick with a flat ass.

				Thanks man, just worried about them knowing anything in case things don&#039;t work out, so a bit on edge about them knowing I can provide those type of goodies.

				Slam a shot of liquor, follow it with a few pints of ale..&nbsp; That should help clean up any shyness issues.&nbsp; And yeah, obviously don&#039;t break out the stash until you are pretty sure you are in decent company..<br /><br />It took me a long time, and many failed attempts at relationships on different levels before I met my girlfriend..&nbsp; And as long as I don&#039;t get too high on dope and make an ass of myself, we get along fucking great.

				I talk to the girls I fuck. Some are interesting people, and so the choice to remain around them isn&#039;t a painful one. <br /><br />Its a simple as texting her back after that hookup. Difficult, but not impossible. Why the distinction between girls who put out on the first date, and those that fail to? <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d say best bet for you would be to sign up to plenty of fish or one of those dating sites, it takes ten minutes to make a profile then just write up a template some thing like &quot;new to this site yours is the first profile I have seen that I have liked if you want to chat further let me know, sorry im new to this and really shy&quot; then send that template to every single profile you like. I tried it once (wasn&#039;t for dating wanted more casual) and out of about 100 messages sent got like 20-25 reply.<br /><br />It&#039;s really easy and if your shy best bet as the girls will click on your profile, if they don&#039;t like you delete it and that is the end of it they will never remember you if they saw you in the street etc.

				Like roundhead said, if you&#039;re shy, online is a good place to start (PlentyofFish and OKCupid are both free I think). Try coffee shops rather than bars. Find a place where you can be a regular and practice just talking to people there - no matter what they look like or their age. Your goal doesn&#039;t need to be meeting the girl, but meeting someone who knows the girl and who can introduce you. :)<br /><br />Sign up for a few weekend classes or workshops (especially those that seem female-friendly) and sames as the coffee shop, talk to everyone there, even those who you wouldn&#039;t want to date. Most people have at least one single friend who they&#039;d like to set up, and if you make it known that you&#039;re available you have a much better chance of someone playing matchmaker for you. Tell people you&#039;re shy, too - many people are secretly shy, and putting it out there will make you seem easier to talk to. <br /><br />If you have any friends who are already couples, take advantage.&nbsp; Tell them you wish you had a relationship like theirs. There&#039;s a good chance the girl will have at least a few single female friends who have been telling her the same thing. Don&#039;t forget to just ask them how they met. It might give you ideas. <br /><br />If coffee shops &amp; online dating &amp; the classes &amp; your friend&#039;s friends don&#039;t work, get a puppy.&nbsp; It&#039;s cliche, for sure, but there&#039;s a reason for that. Cute puppies make girls melt, and having a dog means you&#039;re forced to walk it and take it to parks and will get you outside where you&#039;ll meet someone. (You can even use the puppy as an excuse for the workshop thing - just sign up with it for an obedience class.) Or if you can&#039;t get a dog for some reason, just look online for places that need dogsitters or dog walkers.<br /><br />Finally, if you can, look for a girl who doesn&#039;t do or has never done drugs at all (ideally someone with a decent job or career that she cares about).&nbsp; It means that in the beginning she won&#039;t know what to look for and so it will be easier to hide or just avoid mention of your business.&nbsp; It also means you don&#039;t need to worry about her just being into you for the drugs (or stealing your stash, or bringing around any friends who use). <br /><br />Of course once you&#039;ve been seeing her for a while, you can persuade her to do some molly with you. She&#039;ll love you for it &amp; it&#039;ll mean she&#039;ll get over any reservations she might have had about drugs to begin with. If she&#039;s smart and open-minded she&#039;ll likely want to try others - but because of her work will be unlikely to go off the deep end with them. <br /><br />Good luck though, and be patient.&nbsp; Sometimes finding someone is just a matter of time.

				I&#039;m very awkward and shy with new people, and met my boyfriend on an online drug community (not this one). We started off as friends and then I realized I had more in common with him than anyone I&#039;d ever met, and we hooked up.
