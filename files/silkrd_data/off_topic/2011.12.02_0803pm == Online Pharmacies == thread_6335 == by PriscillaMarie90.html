				Can online pharmacies be trusted? I&#039;ve heard they say they&#039;re from canada but then the drugs really come from like pakistan or something and they&#039;re all expired and shit? Lmao! Does anyone know of any online pharmacies that are legit?<br /><br />Some I found were: valuepharmeceuticals.com, northwestpharmacy.com, planetdrugsdirect.com<br />Has anyone even heard of these? Lol.. Thanks for any information.

				There are legit Canadian online pharmacies, and it&#039;s not too hard to weed out the scammer&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />You need to verify the pharmacies license, the site may have it posted directly, or you might have to contact them, either way get the pharmacy&#039;s licensing info and any &#039;accredited&#039; organizations they may claim to be members of.<br /><br />Then go to the Canadian International Pharmacy Association&#039;s website:<br />http://www.cipa.com/<br /><br />Compare licenses, most scammer&#039;s are so stupid they don&#039;t even know the CIPA exists, and their license won&#039;t be in there.&nbsp; It&#039;s as far as I know the only third party organization in Canada that represents the legit association of licensed retail pharmacies.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t belong to CIPA steer clear.<br /><br />The downside to &#039;legit&#039; online pharmacies is that legit ones actually require a physical doctor&#039;s script, so unless you are just looking at online pharmacies for cheaper drugs there&#039;s really no point I see in using online pharmacies.

				Nah, I&#039;m not looking for prescription medicine. I&#039;m trying to find Depo-Provera, which you don&#039;t need a prescription for, but its almost as expensive as it would be to just go back to the doctor to get it, lol. :P<br /><br />Thanks for the information though, I didnt know there was such a website!

				Actually Depo-Provera comes pre-measured in a one-time-use syringe with safety needle. You do not have to be a medical professional to administer it. If you have never given your self an intramuscular injection before, you&#039;d need a nurse or doc to show you how it&#039;s done, but after that it&#039;s easy as pie. <br />Essentially, you grab a handful of butt cheek in one hand, squeeze, and quickly jab the needle into the muscle, squirt, and you&#039;re done.

				All I can Personally tell you is that On-Line Pharmas are Hit or Miss. Thank God for SR! I kid you not, but I have Lost over $800 dlls dealing with these scamming on-line Pharma Scammers and each time I felt I &quot;found the one&quot; they would fuck me once they gained mt Trust. SR has more and more of what anyone could possibly need. Steroids, Anti-Biotics, Good Weed, Benzos and Anti-Depressants. Granted, I have been scammed even here on SR, but it was My Own Fault for going out of Escrow. If your looking for a particular med, I&#039;m sure if you Post it on Forum or turn to Vendor that has similar type meds they will get if for you.
