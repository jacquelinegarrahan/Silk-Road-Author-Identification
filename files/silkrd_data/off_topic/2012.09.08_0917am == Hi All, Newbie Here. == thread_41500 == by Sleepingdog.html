				Hi Everyone (except for all the scammers), Sleepingdog here. Just taking the opportunity to introduce myself to the wider community here on the SR Forum. Joined just over a month ago and have spent that time reading the forums, learning to safely obtain BTC, etc. I have finally placed my first 2 orders so I&#039;ll see how that goes. I&#039;m really feeling a bit wary after having read the forums here for more than a month. But we&#039;ll see what happens. I&#039;m not impressed by the high level of scamming and I think it is so unfortunate to see this going on here on SR. On one of the orders I placed the vendor suddenly changed his tune and told me I would have to FE or he would not send. He did this after I had placed my order. Talk about changing the goalposts in the middle of the game.He even changed his profile to say that all buyers with less than 3 stats would have to FE. This was done after I had placed my order. On the other order the vendor was really cool and good communications. I placed an order and the money is in escrow so I have no worries on that one. All I can do now is wait and see how it works out. This is my first post here on the forums. I just wanted to introduce myself and say hi to everyone. Here&#039;s hoping for the best.<br /><br />SD

				I am still pretty new on the road. I have had no issues at all. I was nervous as hell waiting for my first order. And then once&nbsp; I got it, I was paranoid for about 10 seconds. Vendors have been polite with me, and I have been polite to them. I get weed delivered to my door, and there is such a variety. It is all fine and good to be able to buy quantity; it is another level of awesome when one has the opportunity to sample products from a different area.<br /><br />Just to reiterate, never FE ever. If you are new, message the vendor first and see if they are interested in doing business with you. Understanding that this isn&#039;t fucking Wal-Mart, and sometimes things take a few days to happen. Do not be afraid to contact active members on the forum for advice about vendors. Be prompt with feedback. I think if you give prompt and well thought out feedback, you will never have a problem with any vendors.<br /><br />If I had any general advice, let SR staff know about scammers/ fishy vendors. Work out any issues in private.Once a resolution is reached, then post any relevant info. Or just do whatever the fuck you want. It is entirely up to you.<br /><br />For more esoteric (although hilarious) bullshit, I will have to defer to Cicero.
