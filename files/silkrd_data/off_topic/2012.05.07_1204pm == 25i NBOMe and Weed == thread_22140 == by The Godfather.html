				Post by: <strong>The Godfather</strong> on <strong>May 07, 2012, 12:04 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Greetings all,<br /><br />Last night my fiancee and I tried two tabs of DudeRugs&#039;s 25i-NBOMe - the visuals on that alone were quite nice but nothing much really. When I felt the drug starting to wear off I decided to smoke a bit of weed. I usually have three to five hits from my mini bong to get a good effect from the weed but I decided to only have two hits shared with my fiancee who only had a few puffs. Minutes after smoking the weed I felt a lot more fucked than I normally feel on weed, obviously, but I thought the 25i was almost completely gone! We turned off the lights and tried to get to sleep, my fiancee told me that she was feeling very high from just those few puffs and me, well, I was on another level altogether! The visuals after smoking the weed were INSANE compared to just tripping on the 25i.<br /><br />When my eyes were open I could see the curtains swaying from side to side and if I looked straight up at the roof I could see what looked like a laser from a night-club shining on the ceiling in little hexagon shapes with other odd shapes here and there. When I closed my eyes it was like watching a movie in my head! Normally when I close my eyes the things that I see are not very clear but these visuals were as clear as day!<br /><br />Has anyone else tried this and what did you feel from doing it? Anything similar to this?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />The Godfather

				Yeah I mean the 25i was good but nothing compared to after smoking the weed! Weed does normally increase the feeling of any other drug but I noticed that when on E I smoked some weed on the come-down and that was a BIG MISTAKE! Worst come-down ever! So depressing! I wont be doing that again!!! Haha!

But then again, I did smoke a shit load of weed so maybe that&#039;s what the problem was... I&#039;ll try it again some time with a little bit less weed :)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />The Godfather

				25I and cannabis was like 1+1=11 for me. 2mg of 25i and a single spliff (about 0.3g) tripped me out to an impossible +++. I fell into my own mouth over and over. I saw my own face forever. There were teeth and eyes and mouths and faces screaming. Illuminati imagery and US currency flashed in front of my eyes. I saw impossible shapes. My senses all blended and I saw sounds and tasted fabrics. My thoughts looped, and I experienced thoughts instead of having them.<br /><br />Crazy shit! 25i isn&#039;t much of a headfuck until you smoke on it.

But I am not a regular user and this was my first time trying 25i so I wanted to start of small but I must say that you should try with 2 tabs to start with, I would expect the come-up to be a bit more intense because on taking the two tabs seperately the come-up was long and took a lot of time to get me where I actually wanted to be.<br /><br />The Godfather

				kwiktrips 25i had me talking to sticks that were snakes that were squids. Also seen &#039;Rainbow deer face&#039; patterns on the ground. And some of the trees near me were happy, but one of them was grouchy.<br /><br /><br />Interesting experience, without a doubt.

				That&#039;s odd because every time I trip on 25i I noticed that smoking bud has no different effect other than it allows me to smoke a massive amount compared to normal. Don&#039;t get me wrong though, I freaking love being able to smoke so much! ;D
