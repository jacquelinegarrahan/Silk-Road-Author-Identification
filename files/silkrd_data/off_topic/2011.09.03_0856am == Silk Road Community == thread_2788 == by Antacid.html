				What did you think about :<br /><br />Giving every user that implemented XY Bitcoins (let´z imagine 25 ) a free SR T-Shirt for our grand Community :-)<br /><br /><br />Post Scribtum : As a LE i would easily sell these t-shirts here and get yr address,cuz many of you may think it´z legal so only for that you could give your legal address :-)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and i ,as LE, would lough me blind !!!<br /><br />So ,perhaps SR could give us a lil bit back -security included !

				i had trouble understanding what you said but SR does give us something back he gave you a site where you can buy drugs. simple as that, not saying you but people who complain about SR taking a fee off every transaction should go back to the streets he deserves the cash honestly not to only line his pocket but for security precaution and reason to keep it going, everybody needs to eat and unless your a serious anarchist would want cash out of anything your doing especially illegal<br />and about tshirts i think that they are a bad idea people who want the world knowing about SR should reconsider the facts, your getting drugs mailed to you through a government funded mailing agency. and drugs period some even class A felony

				Yaap , of course - i donnot want something back -that´z not the point <br />and<br />i donnot wanna around with my SR T-shirt and tell everybody ....<br /><br />Perhaps i´m a been stuck hippie , just want this for my feeling of solidarity and i could wear it if i´m doing alone my newest drugs from SR ..<br /><br />This idea was born ,cuz i wanna have a t-shirt ,but never ever will order here one- so how to get ,but donnot want to make one for me alone -that´z different ,you know ?<br /><br />Just for the first 50BC´s everybody,who wants !!, could get one :-)<br /><br />What´s wrong about it ?<br /><br />I´m proud of being a part of it !!<br /><br />And normally i even hate this word -pride- and would never use !<br /><br />Sorry for my bad english ,but i´m writing down ,what i did remember ,without checking it with a transl. tool !!<br />The more i use ,better it will be :-)
