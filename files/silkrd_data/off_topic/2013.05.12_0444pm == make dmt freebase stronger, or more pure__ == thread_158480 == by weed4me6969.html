				ALRIGHT!!!!&nbsp; I did it this morning guys!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I used the gravity bong(more of this freebase than i have ever done) and sandwiched it between some cannabis...boy that shit was milky!!&nbsp; I than took 95% of it all in one hit...laid down, and was surprised to notice that i didnt have much anxiety or any drastic increase in heart rate.&nbsp; Continued to lay there and after about 25-30seconds, i was like wtf, why isnt this shit from moon unit hitting me like the crystal i got from addyqueenhashking??? I cant believe i was afraid to do this!&nbsp; i took more than i have ever taken in one hit!!&nbsp; Although i did get some halfway decent shroom like (breathing) hallucinations, but i didnt even get close to any decent hallucinations, and am rather dissappointed because i took a HUGE hit, it must&#039;ve been done right because that shit was smoking like a chimney, I never seen soo much smoke in a gravity bong...&nbsp; The taste was extremely strong!! I think that this freebase is not very strong at all, and maybe that is why we were able to get a G for only $75.&nbsp; I know now what i must do!!&nbsp; I need to convert this freebase into a salt, i think, i just want to make this more pure, more potent.&nbsp; What do i need to do guys, i want to experience the damn breakthrough!!&nbsp; can i please get some advice on how to do this purifying or recrystalization thing....i just want it to be like the crystals that i smoked from AQHK, where 1 big hit from a damn pipe had me gone into crysanthemum land, and two hits was WAWAWAWAWAHHH!!!&nbsp; Help me out guys...
