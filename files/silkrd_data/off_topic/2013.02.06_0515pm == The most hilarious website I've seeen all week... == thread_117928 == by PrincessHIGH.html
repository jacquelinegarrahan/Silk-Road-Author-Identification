				A friend shared this with me (clearwebalert) http://druglordsmarket.com their sister sites (clearwebalert) http://washyourmoney.com and (clearwebalert) http://findahitman.com kept the lulz rolling, there&#039;s more for slaves and sniper rifles too but by this time I was laughing so hard I wasn&#039;t going to risk falling off my chair! These sites have to be seen to be believed, seriously funny shit! If anybody has fallen for this they seriously need their head tested. Still, it gave me my laugh for the afternoon, some dopey druglords ;D
