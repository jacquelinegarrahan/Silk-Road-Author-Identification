				First of all, I do not mean the criminal act of stealing or attempting to steal a motor vehicle!<br /><br />I&#039;m aware that we&#039;ve got some game threads here on SR, but in my opinion the Grand Theft Auto series totally deserves it&#039;s own official thread here.<br /><br />Earlier this day / night I&#039;ve came across IGNs GTA V site, which contains tons of information and media coverage.<br /><br />Their latest news items regarding GTA V give the reader a good impression on how the series has evolved, Rockstar&#039;s love for detail and what we&#039;re going to expect.<br /><br />I also recommend checking out the Rewind Theater for an in-depth analysis of the latest trailers.<br /><br />CLEARNET; http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/<br /><br />I remember playing the first GTA for ages with my friends, one simple rule: Whoever&#039;s got busted or wasted had to hand over the controller.<br /><br />I had my by far best video game experiences with GTA, it&#039;s met always my expectations and has yet to disappoint me which I&#039;m certain of it&#039;ll never do.<br /><br />Please feel free to share your experiences with this outstanding series, your anticipations for the upcoming fifth part etc.<br /><br />PS: If you&#039;ve watched the latest character trailers, which do you favor the most? (I&#039;m personally sold on Trevor)<br /><br />PPS: Which has been the first GTA part you&#039;ve played?

				I&#039;ve been a huge fan ever since the first Grand Theft Auto in the 90&#039;s on PC, I still have the original CD. I purchased every single GTA brought out for PC after that and I still regularly mow down peds in GTAIV and EFLC. I don&#039;t really favor any of the characters I think they are all equally great, the GTA designers have really come a LONG way in terms of character design and their games now rival most Hollywood movies for atmosphere, screenplay, script writing, story etc... the interactivity of the games is just a freakin huge bonus as far as i&#039;m concerned ;)<br /><br />Bring on GTAV, I cannot fucking wait :) PC owners any inside info on what the PC version is going to be like?

				Have not played GTA in a long time (what, last year or something?). <br /><br />Hate the outdated graphics. <br /><br />Love the gameplay. <br /><br />Hate the that you can&#039;t aim too well in GTAIV (for some reason I just fall over ??? ). <br /><br />Love the plot and the way things have been really well thought out to the point it actually becomes addictive. <br /><br />Hate the fact that you cannot effectively kill the cops (every time I phone the police and then blow his head off when he comes to &#039;save me&#039;, a shitload of cops arrive and I cannot run fast enough to my car for a getaway, or my stupid Lamborghini falls over on its side and I am left stranded taking bullets &gt;:( &gt;:( ).&nbsp; <br /><br />Love the attention to detail all across the board you don&#039;t just don&#039;t get with Saints Row, they&#039;re the same developers, what gives.<br /><br />Hate the fact that you feel guilty actually playing it. It takes too much time as it is too addictive, I just quit it after I clocked it. Oh yeah, it quietens down a lot when you clock it. It feels so different. It&#039;s weird.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Raz if you&#039;re running the PC version of GTAIV, you can download addon Texture packs that upgrade the textures, you will need at least a 2GB video card, i5/i7 &amp; 8GB ram to run it at a decent framerate though ;) SSD&#039;s can halve the loading times too.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going down the Mods route, get the &#039;Simple Native Trainer&#039; mod as well, it has literally hundreds of game variables you can play with, god mode, unlimited ammo, no reload, change clothes, spawn all cars, teleporting, spawn all weapons plus shitloads more.<br /><br />GTAIV is definitely the game I play the most...

Not enough time to constantly upgrade, it&#039;s an time thing. I&#039;ve got the cheat code to GTAIV, except the weather resets to Storm permanently, meaning you have to use another cheat to switch it back. But I kept falling off buildings when I tried to just peep over with my sniper rifle. So annoying. They should really fix that problem. Also, the car dealers wouldn&#039;t let me buy the really good car I kept hearing about so I gave up and shot them, so I kept having to reload at that point. It has some annoying things that the game developers should work on with GTAV. If not, they&#039;ll be missing out on my $50! :D ....... ::)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				first experience when I was a kid gta firs on playstation, gta london , gta 2 - never completed but had fun. Gta 3 - revolution, everyone was crazy about this game when it came out. it revolutionized open world games. Later ones gta vice city , gta san andreas i waited with big anticipation. I didn;t have a chance to complete gta vice city stories but completed liberty city stories. Gta 4 - played it and completed it two times also it&#039;s two DLC&#039;s . Waiting for gta 5 now but not with that big of anticipations - there&#039;s games that interest me more nowadays like beyond two souls , last of us.

				Yeah, a lot of people like San Andreas. Never played it myself. Only GTA (the original one), GTA: Vice City, and GTAIV. I liked Vice City but only played at a friends house so didn&#039;t really play a lot.<br /><br />Hey. This may be off topic, but a GTAIII arcade was in The Simpsons Movie. There is an easter egg just after Homer stops playing but haven&#039;t figured it out. If someone knows, post here. :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and I Need More LINES!!! &gt;:D

				Nope, no coke lines, that&#039;s the thing... I&#039;m all out. :&#039;( Last lines were speed not coke, but it&#039;s more expensive than coke where I live. And it&#039;s always fucked on the cut so [edit]. :-\ I never played san andreas at all actually. Clocked IV. Ah... DLC... that would be the 2 expansion packs. Yeah I was going to buy them but they disappeared from the stores pretty quick. :-\ <br /><br />Piece, Love and Fuck Haters.

				My Gf pre-ordered it for me on my birthday, Cant fucking wait for it. <br /><br />My first GTA was the original on ps1 . With the birds eye view and everything. I still remember the theme tune, it was such a great game. <br />My favorite one since then was defo GTA san andreas, There was so much content for it&#039;s time. <br />The gameplay was even better than the graphics. <br />I cant wait too see how much content they whack into this one. <br /><br />The one thing that really gets to me now though is rockstar&#039;s release dates...... originally meant for spring 2013, Then they put it back to september, which just happens to be around 3 months before Xmas when the PS4 and Xbox 720 are scheduled, So they will break records with sales because everybody is anticipating it so badly, and then everybody will want to see what it&#039;s like on the new console so they&#039;l buy the game again. The whole release is designed around making them extra money not customers satisfaction, they have gotten so pupular that they dont need to keep us happy as the game will sell anyway. <br /><br />As far as DLC goes , i miss the days when you purchased a game and that was you bought it, Not that you had to keep purchasing extyra content if you want certain things or trophys etc. it&#039;s all a rip off now.
