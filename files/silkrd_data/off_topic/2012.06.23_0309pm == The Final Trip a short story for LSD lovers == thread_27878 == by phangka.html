				First, I will start by saying that I didn&#039;t write this story.&nbsp; I have no knowledge of the people or events that take place in the story.&nbsp; This is something that I found on a forum several years back.&nbsp; After reading it I decided to save a copy.&nbsp; While most likely this is a work of complete fiction it is still an amazing read.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;d really like to see some comments from the people who take time to read it.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><br /><br />Briareos&#039; thumbprinting the acid story:<br /><br />The “final trip” story<br /><br /><br />This story requires I tell a side story in order for<br />it to truly sink in, and make sense.<br /><br /><br />Part 1: The story of David.<br /><br /><br />David was my first friend in New Mexico, and probably<br />my best friend ever. He was also the guy to give me my<br />first acid. David started acid at the tender age of<br />10, due to the fact that his father was one of the<br />biggest acid middle men in the state. He was<br />experienced in acid, and knew every trick in the book…<br />he taught me everything I know about acid to date. He<br />was also VERY smart. He thought of acid as a gateway<br />into his mind, and would often take insane doses (40+<br />hits) in order to explore his consciousness. He was<br />the one who got me to start taking large doses. Since<br />1994, David had spoken of the “ultimate trip”, the one<br />that would end his search for himself. In case you<br />couldn’t tell, David was a very deep person, and was<br />under the impression that this massive dose would<br />ultimately unlock the potential of his mind… that dose<br />is often known as “thumb printing a crystal”. Acid in<br />its purest form is a solid crystal, and if you were to<br />touch it with slightly damp thumb, you would instantly<br />absorb the equivalent of well over 100 hits of acid.<br /><br />David had prepared his whole teenage years, as did we<br />all, for the ultimate trip. He studied its effects,<br />upped his dose often to test his limits, and spent a<br />year or two learning how to properly meditate to keep<br />him calm during the trip. On November 2nd 2001, David<br />thumb printed a black amber crystal known as Timothy<br />Leary II... he committed suicide by stabbing himself<br />in the throat with a broken mirror piece just hours<br />later.<br /><br /><br />The “final trip” story<br /><br />Part 2: My story<br /><br /><br />I attended David’s funeral on November 8th, and it was<br />the only time I had ever been to a social function<br />sober. The news of David had devastated me beyond. I<br />didn’t have the will to dose for that whole week. As I<br />sat there sobbing to myself and cursing David for ever<br />leaving me like that, then I realized that he hadn’t<br />killed himself because of the acid… he did it because<br />he HAD found himself, and he didn’t like what he had<br />seen. David was insecure and often berated himself for<br />his shortcomings. He always swore that once he had<br />tapped his mind, if he didn’t like what he saw then<br />there was no reason to go on. He once told me that he<br />had “sadistic thoughts”… thoughts that kept him up at<br />night shivering in his bed. He had unlocked his mind,<br />and what he found frightened him bad enough, that he<br />took his life.<br /><br />I followed in the steps of David like a loyal puppy.<br />What he did, I did. David was my teacher in what he<br />called the spiritual realm. We would take huge doses<br />of acid and put ourselves into a trance like state in<br />order to explore our minds deepest chasms… he taught<br />me meditation, and the principles of OBE. I loved<br />David like a brother, and his passing made me<br />seriously step back and take a look at my life. At<br />this point I had been taking acid for over 10 years,<br />and I hadn’t learned anything truly about myself or my<br />thoughts. I wanted to go further… as far as David had.<br /><br />That night, I went over to David’s house to speak with<br />his father. We talked about the good ol’ days when the<br />3 of us would eat a 10 strip and look at the stars.<br />Then I dropped the bomb on his dad, “Larry, I want to<br />see the amber crystal.” “NO”, he said. “I won’t let<br />you go too.” I begged him for the next three months,<br />but got turned down every time. Larry had thumb<br />printed a crystal when he was in his 20’s, and ended<br />up scaring himself so bad that he developed a slight<br />case of schizophrenia, and he didn’t want to see<br />another mind taken by it. I relented. I had to see<br />what David saw… I had to know why such a bright mind<br />with an obvious bright future would end his life the<br />way he did. I was prepared to do the same if it came<br />down to it.<br /><br /><br /><br />March 2nd 2002<br /><br /><br />It was about 9:00am when I got the call from Larry.<br />“Don, I’m coming over at 10:00pm”, he said, “I want<br />everything sharp placed in a box along with the<br />mirrors on your wall stacked by your door when I get<br />there.” He had submitted… he was bringing the black<br />amber crystal to my house that night, and I was going<br />to touch the beast.<br /><br />I did as he had requested… I took all the mirrors off<br />my wall and stacked them near my door along with a box<br />full of forks, knives, and a letter opener. When he<br />arrived, he started placing all of this in the back of<br />his truck, and told me he would return it the moment,<br />“I could form sentences”. He explained the dangers of<br />this kind of trip, and tried to prepare me for what<br />would become at least one full month of the hardest<br />trip I had ever encountered.<br /><br />“before we start”, he said,” I need to show you this.”<br />It was David’s suicide note… the note they found<br />clenched in a death grip in his left hand. It wasn’t<br />really a note, as much as it was 3 words on a yellow<br />sheet of paper… “let me out”. “You still wanna do<br />this?” I nodded and he began to explain the rules of<br />thumb printing.<br /><br />Rule 1: no mirrors… not just because they were<br />breakable and sharp, but because of the effect of<br />seeing yourself on a trip this hard may cause you to<br />freak out.<br /><br />Rule 2: no leaving the house for at least 1 week. I<br />was told to deadbolt my door the second he left, and<br />then get back to my seat as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Rule 3: whatever happens, remember to look at your<br />arms… “If you can see”. (Referencing the black marker<br />on the arm trick)<br /><br />Rule 4: “keep a phone with 911 on speed dial near. If<br />shit goes bad, they can administer thorizine to bring<br />you down… Kinda.<br /><br />He placed the crystal on my table using a thick pair<br />of rubber gloves, and brought out a sponge that had<br />been soaked in everclear. The alcohol was to put on my<br />thumb, to help speed the melting / absorption process.<br />You only have a second to touch the crystal… any more<br />and you could be putting yourself in a world of<br />misery. I took a deep breath, thanked Larry and hugged<br />him, then put my everclear soaked thumb on the<br />crystal.<br /><br />The second I touched the crystal my thumb burned like<br />I had just touched a hot range top, and upon taking it<br />off, I noticed I already had a large darkened blister<br />forming there. Then my hand went numb. I quickly<br />locked my door and put the deadbolt &amp; chain on. By the<br />time I had sat down my entire body had went numb. I<br />felt like I couldn’t breathe. All of the times before<br />when I had dropped 40+ hits could have never prepared<br />me for this trip. My walls heaved back and forth, the<br />floor felt like it had liquefied, and my heart felt as<br />though it was about to beat out of my chest. Then it<br />happened….<br /><br />Almost as soon as the peak had hit, it was over. I sat<br />on my couch just staring ahead, wondering what went<br />wrong. Had Larry tricked me, and let me touch a fake<br />crystal with a drop of acid on it? How could he do<br />this to me! I got up and stormed around my apartment<br />cursing Larry for fucking with my head… he had<br />prepared me for a trip he knew would never happen. I<br />called his house; only to receive an out of order<br />recording… it was working earlier. He had turned off<br />his phone! By this time, I was fuming pissed, and<br />screaming at the top of my lungs. I ran out the door<br />and drove to his house. Upon arrival, I noticed his<br />truck wasn’t there, and the house was dark. I tried<br />for the next 24 hours to get ahold of him… nothing.<br />The next day I went to work and came home just like<br />any other day, except I could feel that something was<br />wrong. All day I kept having funny occurrences that<br />just seemed out of place. Perhaps the acid did work,<br />but on a deeper more subtle level. At work a lady had<br />asked me if I “knew my father”. I replied “yes”… my<br />mother divorced my dad when I was only 2, but I still<br />saw him occasionally and received his money every<br />month… but the more I thought about it, I DIDN’T<br />really know my father. I knew nothing about him. I<br />finished ringing her up for her new E-machine and bid<br />her a good day, when she turned and added, “ Don’t let<br />an opportunity pass you by”. I nodded and forgot the<br />whole conversation. The rest of the day was<br />interesting to say the least. For a Sunday, the roads<br />were very empty, and there didn’t seem to be many<br />people out. Circuit city was dead that day, and I had<br />only made about $75, so I was ready to go home and let<br />this weekend from hell end in alcohol soaked bliss.<br /><br />I sat there on my couch, in the same place I had sat<br />the night before, thinking that I was going to start<br />tripping any second…. Nothing. I kept taking small<br />swigs off of a plastic bottle of vodka that I had put<br />away in my bong cabinet. I wanted to trip that night,<br />but couldn’t bring myself to call and find any. Larry<br />was the go to man, and he had skipped town… with all<br />my shit. A knock at my door made me jump right out of<br />my skin. I answered the door to what would ultimately<br />be the crowning moment of the weekend. There before me<br />stood my best friend in the whole world… David.<br /><br /><br /><br />Part: 3 – The end of an 11 year binge.<br /><br />I shivered uncontrollably at his sight. I was scared,<br />but at the same time calm like no other swept over me.<br />I felt… warm, like I was being hugged by invisible<br />arms. I stared at David for what seemed like an hour<br />without a word spoken. “Can I come in?”… He spoke. He<br />was really here… alive! David! We sat down on my<br />couch, and starred at each other… I couldn’t believe<br />he was here. Maybe the acid had worked, and this was a<br />solid hallucination. A quick poke confirmed that he<br />was a solid as you and I. “I was at your funeral”… “I<br />know” he said. “I called you an asshole”… “I know” he<br />said again. “I’m sorry, I just didn’t understand<br />why.”… “I know”. He held out a sheet of white paper<br />for me to take…. On it was written, “let me out”… this<br />time in my own hand writing. Then he was gone. I sat<br />there and cried because he had left me again. I didn’t<br />understand what just happened, all I knew was that the<br />acid had worked… perhaps too well.<br /><br />I opened my eyes to wipe the tears only to find that<br />it was actually 4 hours later, and I was wearing the<br />same clothes I had worn the night before…. In my left<br />hand was a white sheet of paper that I had written,<br /><br />“let me out”.<br /><br />It was all a mass hallucination. The entire weekend<br />never happened; I had never even left my couch for<br />those 2 days. The whole time I was a prisoner in my<br />own mind, unable to move or respond… only carry out a<br />second by second waking dream in my head. I had lived<br />the past day as if I had been there. I had to piss<br />like a race horse, and my mouth was so dry it hurt. I<br />was tripping harder than I had ever tripped before. I<br />found myself to be completely emotionless. I couldn’t<br />even muster a tear for the thought of David. I had<br />beaten the peak, the hardest part of the trip… I was<br />alive, but I felt no joy nor sorrow.<br /><br />April 13th 2002. I woke up to the most pleasant thing<br />I had felt in months… sobriety! It was over, and I had<br />won. I laid there on my bed, in the fetal position,<br />crying like a little bitch for the next 2 days. It<br />took almost 3 weeks to regain my equilibrium and begin<br />to feel normal again. It took almost a month before I<br />realized what it was that the trip had taught me. I<br />took for granted that my father had been sending me<br />acid money for the past 11 years, but I had never<br />stopped to thank him… much less call him. The lady in<br />circuit city was a creation of my mind that allowed me<br />to see this. I called my father that night, and we<br />talked for 5 hours… I learned more about him that<br />night, than I had in the past 23 years.<br /><br />I don’t do acid anymore, maybe because the acid does<br />me now. I am getting a return on my investment, as I<br />am now among those who call themselves perma-fried. I<br />had spent almost half of my life on the drug, but<br />until that experience, I had never truly grasped what<br />acid was capable of. I live in a constant trip now…<br />maybe psychological, maybe physical… like I said, I’m<br />no scientist, but I have never been the same since. I<br />no longer know sobriety. When I was kid, all I had to<br />do was stop dosing and the trip went away… now, I<br />don’t have that luxury. I have learned to live with<br />it, and truth be told… it’s not that bad. I am so used<br />to it now, I don’t even remember what true sobriety<br />felt like. Tripping is my new sobriety… it is who I am.
