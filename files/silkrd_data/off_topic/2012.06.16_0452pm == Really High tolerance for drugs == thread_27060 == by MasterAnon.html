				Ok so for some reason I naturally have a really high tolerance for drugs. Meaning I can&#039;t get high. Its insanely annoying. I can smoke blunts all day and not get stoned. I can snort speed and it does fuck all cept make my eyes shine haha. Got any suggestions on what I can do about this, I really need to loosen up a bit without doing any hard drugs like heroin.

For good measure mix some 5-MeO-DALT with it too, as I heard it makes a pleasant boost drug as well. ;)

				I&#039;ve always had quite high tolerance too, maybe it&#039;s cause im 80 kilos, so a bit of fat.<br /><br />But yeah, kinda annoying to see how my friends are in heaven with 1 blotter and 100mg of MDMA when I myself only get a decent roll with 2-3 blotters and 200mg<br /><br />Not very cheap when you need 500+ Âµg of lucy and like 1g of ketamine/0.5 of MDMA for a good evening. Oh well, atleast it helps me to not go overboard with using, twice a week is more than enough

				Get some Mephedrone! Anyone who knows me on these forums know my obsession with it&nbsp; ::). It&#039;s a seriously euphoric stimulant, the rush is very intense and hits you quite fast. If you have a high tolerance to drugs, rail a 150mg line of it, trust me you&#039;ll feel king of the world&nbsp; ;D

				Happened with my mate first time he smoked, turns out he just needed to get absolutely fucked before he could get stoned from small amounts.Have a bowl or two, he can get stoned from a few hits now.<br />If not then i doubt your smoking it properly . Its not tobacco, you don&#039;t breathe straight out, try holding it in as long as you can, you will probably end up coughing if your not used to it, but try holding it in for at least 3-4 seconds.<br />Last thing could be what your smoking, you sure its not complete bunk?<br /><br />Locker.

				Hehe I know how to smoke it guys, thanks. And I always buy off SR, some mates tried it and get fucked so it ain&#039;t fake shit, also it does kinda show in my eyes that I am technically high, but I feel nothing. I still worry about everything like I normally do, doesn&#039;t help with my pain from my condition one bit and I talk normally, nobody would notice I even smoked it. Never tried half the stuff mentioned though, not even Pakistan Kush or ISO hash, so gonna give that a go at some point before trying some of the other stuff mentioned.
