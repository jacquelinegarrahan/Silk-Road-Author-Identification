				Xbox generally has better games and the slim model is awesome.&nbsp; Kinect is better than move.&nbsp; The lack of bluray sucks though.&nbsp; Ps3 looks good with the new game &quot;the last of us&quot;; i wish that game was on the Xbox.

				PS3. better aesthetics, bluray, better controllers, more games because Sony will take on anything and MS insist game writers must play by their rules - how long did it take for GTA to come out on the eggbox originally? free network. Gran Turismo kicks shit out of Forza, and WipeOut is the best. the only thing the xbox has got on it is the kinect is better than the move. but who gives a shit - i don&#039;t want to exercise when i&#039;m shooting cunts

				Raoul.. you made some good points there... Currently I am running a 120gig ps3.. I never mod my systems, maybe because i dont see a reason to it plus it can get you banned from online play and all I really play is online game modes... I mostly stick to the COD games and any game that involves a car, driving or flying...<br /><br />I think ima stick with my ps3 for now, even tho it makes funny noises and scares me sometimes its still the nest bang for the buck....<br /><br />I wish panasonic came back with a new version of 3DO.. NOW THAT WOULD BE SIIIIIICK.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve got my PS3 jailbroken because I don&#039;t play it online - and I&#039;m cheap.&nbsp; My PS3 is for single player games and my unmodded Xbox 360 is for games that I want to play online.&nbsp; The Xbox 360 controller has grown on me, but I initially found Grand Theft Auto IV unplayable with it because I was so used to playing GTA: III and its spinoffs with a dualshock controller.

				360 was easier to mod, easier to code for and so the games looked and ran better and had/have better support (Skyrim and Rage are good examples), and was superior at the beginning if you could actually get one that didn&#039;t instantly break and wanted to not pay for your games.<br /><br />With PS3 hacking progressing, now it&#039;s more balanced if you&#039;re into some of the PS3&#039;s exclusives.<br /><br />Personally, I kept a Wii and PC as primaries, and eventually broke down and got a 360 for non-PC titles I didn&#039;t want to do without (Beatles Rock Band anyone? And most JPN titles don&#039;t get ported, like Bayonetta), and it will take a lot more than fucking Metal Gear Full-of-Himself-Kojima Non-Game Movie and a couple of generic shooters to get me to make my room any more of a mess than it is now.<br /><br />And really, if you do have a good PC the argument could be made that the Wii beats them both for great non-PC content. Almost all good 360 games are on the PC as well, but No More Heroes? Donkey Kong Country Returns? Galaxy 1 and 2? Muramasa? Silent Hill: Shattered Memories? Madworld? And it&#039;s cheap and shit easy for any layperson to hack and hook up to a giant USB HDD.

				I had both, got my first 360 with redring for 10$ off a friend, sent it to MS cuz it was under warranty and am on my 4th 360 now, POS if you ask me and just a money hole, but all my friends use it so i stick with it, had a PS3, friend traded it for drugs to another friend, and i bought it off them, then sold it back to the original owner LOL
