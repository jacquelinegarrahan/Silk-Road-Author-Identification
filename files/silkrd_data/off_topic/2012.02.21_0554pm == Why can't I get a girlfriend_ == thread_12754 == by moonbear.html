				I have not had a girlfriend in years. And she was a fat Cherokee who cheated on me. Today I decided to try me luck. I approached a girl, smiled, and said, &quot;hi!&quot;. She made a creeped out glance my way,&nbsp; and picked up her pace. She looked behind her a couple times, and when she saw me, she went even faster. She must have ducked in a room when she turned the corner because I didn&#039;t see her after that. Odd.<br /><br />What is wrong with me?!<br />

				You need to go buy at least 1 set of really nice, expensive-looking clothing and shoes. Wear them the next time you approach a girl, and this time don&#039;t say &quot;Hi&quot;, say &quot;Excuse me, you dropped something...... My jaw!&quot;.

				:) I can&#039;t really believe this topic has been posted but since it has I can&#039;t resist replying.<br /><br />I agree with PriscillaMarie90 that aciddeath&#039;s suggestion is probably the most sensible. I&#039;m also a girl and would appreciate the confidence. But try not to do it in a creepy way. The way you describe essentially chasing that girl down the street indicates that perhaps you give off a little creeper vibe. Be chilled out, and have interesting things to say.

Being a girl, I think it would be really cute for a guy to do that and the confidence definitely makes him more attractive. Other women might disagree, but I would also appreciate that he doesn&#039;t stick around and try to have a conversation with me, lol. Talking to strangers is awkward in person, plus it would make me want to know more about him.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Your a girl? Would you date me? We can just do drugs and talk on forums all day? Maybe we can even meet up in real life to fuck! Don&#039;t worry, if necessary I&#039;ll provide you with plenty of MDMA.<br />Do you think I&#039;d be more likely to get a girlfriend if I slipped some molly in her drink?<br />[/quote]<br /><br />damn you&#039;re one smooth motherfucker moonbear- dude just go to a strip club get a dance and pull out a bag of any drug- you&#039;ll get laid and they&#039;ll probably come back for more- not the loving relationship your looking for but its a start
