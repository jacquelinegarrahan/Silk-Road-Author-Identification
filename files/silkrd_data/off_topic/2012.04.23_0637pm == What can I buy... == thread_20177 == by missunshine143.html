				What can I buy with exactly $9.64 (at the current bitcoin exchange rate)? I already ordered everything I wanted over the sale weekend and am now stuck with leftover money, what can I buy with this amount? Any ideas?

				I was actually looking at that just 30 seconds ago! But I&#039;m not sure which one to go with, the lollipop by Angelina or Hash Cookies by Fabled. Any recommendations? I don&#039;t usually do cannabis but I&#039;m game for edibles!

Give it a shot man, it&#039;s awesome!<br /><br />But i&#039;ve never bought marijuana or marijuana related stuff off of SR, the price just doesn&#039;t seem to be too fair, at least for personal amounts. I have been thinkiing about hash candies tho! <br />I&#039;m not a big fan of edibles, but i loove me some good hash candies!

				I DO smoke weed but not enough to make it as a hobby/regular thing. I just don&#039;t smoke alone, just with friends if/when the opportunity comes up. I prefer edibles such as cookies/brownies because 1. they&#039;re delicious. 2. so much easier than smoking. I do have a Magic Flight Launch Box vape that I break out on special occasions such as partying it up with friends which usually happens around holidays. <br /><br />I&#039;m leaning towards Angelia&#039;s THC suckers just because I have never had a THC laced lollipop. <br /><br />@Simplyanon. I already ordered 20 xanaxes from a vendor, received it today. so, no more benzos needed. xD
