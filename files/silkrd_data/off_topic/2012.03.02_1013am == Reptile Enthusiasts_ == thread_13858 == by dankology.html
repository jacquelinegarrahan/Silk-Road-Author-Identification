				Im an avid fan of all reptiles and collect many, probably more than I should.&nbsp; I own a small collection of 6 different species, although one day I plan to devote at least one entire room to them.&nbsp; I can upload some pics later, but I currently own a Veiled Chameleon, Bearded Dragon, Golden Gecko, Crested Gecko, Cottonmouth, and California Kingsnake.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and get some high res pics of all of them + my whole setup done tomorrow.<br /><br />Anyone else have a collection or interest in reptiles?&nbsp;

				For all my life, I&#039;ve always loved and been fascinated with reptiles, especially snakes. Such beautiful creatures. <br /><br />It&#039;s crazy because I was born in the year of the snake, snake was the animal of the month I was born in, and also the hour at which I was born, which is pretty nuts. And yes, in the chinese zodiac calendar/birth year stuff, there&#039;s an animal for the year you&#039;re born in, the month, and the hour of the day. And it&#039;s the same group of animals for all 3. So, you could be born in the year of the dragon, and the ox could be the animal of the month, and snake could be the hour. So there&#039;s a pretty good variety of combinations that you can have, and I&#039;m snake/snake/snake. ;)<br />It&#039;s even crazier that the zodiac explanation of the personalities of the people born under snake fit me like exactly. Says that snakes can be wise, mystic types who often become loners. That&#039;s like exactly who I am...lol.

				well we already have somebody slanging pet medicine and puppy milk replacer so it&#039;s not really that out there of an idea ;)<br /><br />I like reptiles but I was always more of an arachnid dude though, some of them like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poecilotheria_metallica are absolutely beautiful

				I&#039;d fuckin love an exotic animal trade section.&nbsp; However most of the exotic animals acquired for sell are usually wild and not obtained in the most humane of ways, which I have a problem with.&nbsp; I may breed some species of reptiles in the future exclusively for Silk Road however if it becomes a demand.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not, but my mother is! We had and Iguana for most of my childhood, one we had for about 4 years until she died, then we got a new one which we ended up giving to a close friend after about a year, but now my mom has like 8 tortoises, lmfao! We have had quite a few of those red-eared slider turtles over the years, too.<br /><br />But seriously, my mom has at least 8 tortoises. Most of them are babies, but the largest of them weighs about 70lbs. She loves the shit out of them, she has probably an acre of land fenced off for them and she&#039;s always expanding. The largest 3 of them live outside of her house, but when it&#039;s cold they live in a large tool shed that&#039;s been (somehow) rigged with a heated floor &amp; heat lamps (fire hazard wtf). She has 2 really really small tortoises that are SOOOO fucking cute, and the others range from about the size of your palm to dinner-plate sized. <br /><br />They&#039;re interesting but I can&#039;t imagine wanting to take care of one, lmao!
