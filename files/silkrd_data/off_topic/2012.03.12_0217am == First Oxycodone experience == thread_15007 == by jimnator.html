				I bought 2x Oxycodone HCL 30 mg few days ago. I took 1/4 of 30 mg yesterday. <br /><br />After 30 minutes, my heart began to beat REALLY fast. I was really troubled and called the police to send me an ambulance. While talking to the woman, my heart began to become more stable, so I told her to cancel the ambulance and I will call back again if it happens again.<br /><br />Few minutes later, my body became warm and relaxed. It felt good... Then, a funny analgesic effect happened. I went to my room, I could barely walk and feel my body, I was totally wasted lol! A friend called me and I was so fucking high couldn&#039;t find words and I was talking very slowly, he laughed at me. There was a light euphoria effect which was pleasant. The analgesic effect was very strong. I went to the kitchen get water and I almost fell on the ground, was really high. At the end, I felt sleepy, but I heard it&#039;s not good to sleep on opiates incase you puke and you swallow.<br /><br />At the beginning it really sucked, but when the rush came in, it was pleasant feeling. I don&#039;t understand why people are addicted to it, I didn&#039;t find it addictive, it was just pleasant, but I wouldn&#039;t do it everyday.<br /><br />For the side effects, I had itchy skin and constipation, that&#039;s it. I&#039;d give that drug a 7/10.<br /><br />

				i don&#039;t think you get addicted to them the first time you take them.&nbsp; its only after a period of time where your body starts to crave the drug. then you NEED them just to get back to your baseline.&nbsp; pretty crazy experience for only taking only 7.5mg.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank your vendor for advising you to start off with only a small amount.

				be careful it seems you have an extremely low opiate tolerance so these drugs can be very dangerous. also don&#039;t do them too often once they get the hooks in they aren&#039;t as fun anymore.
