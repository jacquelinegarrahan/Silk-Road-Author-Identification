				Thats a life saved right there.&nbsp; &quot;Getting high is the best medicine&quot;, or is it &#039;The best medicine is getting high&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;no sorry I think its,&nbsp; &quot;Medicine that gets you high, is the best&quot;<br />Anyway the point I&#039;m trying to make is,&nbsp; If you take medicine that gets you high, there&#039;s a big chance you will not kill yourself today.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is giving me a headache I&#039;m gonna take some medicine now.

				&nbsp;:D Glad no one took me too seriously; making light of all the suicide posts I&#039;ve seen on here in the last few months.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know how anyone can seriously come on SILK ROAD forums and claim they&#039;re intending to kill themselves.&nbsp; If you&#039;re that committed to dying... might as well try all the ridiculous drugs on here.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />You never know; you might just find a reason to live.

				What&#039;s happening lately with all these people wanting to suicide themselves?<br /><br />And even more, why all the need to let the world know you are going to suicide? Suicide is a matter between you and and your Self; if you feel the need to let others know this tells that much probably you haven&#039;t a real motivation to do it, no matter if you can think so.<br /><br />P.S: I replied seriously to a sarcasm topic because also if this was a joke there have been in the last days many true topics about this point, one even from a person I enjoyed reading the posts of, so this saddened me very much.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s these suicidal fuckers that make getting hold of barbiturates so difficult.<br /><br />This weekend, I&#039;ll be squirting 100mg of pentobarbital into my rectum post-roll, not swallowing 9g to roll a seven.
