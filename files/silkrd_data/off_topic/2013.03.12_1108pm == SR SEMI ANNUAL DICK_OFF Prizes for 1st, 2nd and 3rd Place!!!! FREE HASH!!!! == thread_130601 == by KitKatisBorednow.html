				Not sure about others, but I&#039;m ready to post.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather do it errect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any other way isn&#039;t accurate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mine goes from an inch to about 8 .&nbsp; Also, using a &#039;vacum pump&#039; will almost double the size.&nbsp; Then you can keep it that way if you use a cock ring a the base, it will hold the blood in.&nbsp; :-). <br /><br />No photoshopping.hehe.&nbsp; &nbsp;To really need a ruler or something for scale in the pict. <br /><br />Anon image hosts are up and about.

				With the ass hair statement, it all depends on how creative you get in your picture, Angle can determine a winner. And you dont have to leave it only to the cock. If you have majestic balls, BY ALL MEANS keep them in the picture. <br /><br />As for outsourcing, we expect you to write one of our names either on your junk, or a piece of paper next to your junk.

				So how&#039;s this work? Do we have to have a sign with our names on it right above our cocks so you will know it&#039;s us? And not some random pic from the web? It&#039;s really kind of shady because anyone can get a well endowed guy to do this for them ya know? There&#039;s also some strap ons that look pretty dam real. So are you just wanting to see who will do this or what? How much would I get for a video of me masturbating while taking a shower? I am interested in stepping this thing up a bit if you are. 8)<br /><br />By the way saterday is the 16th right? Got a lot of scheduled work hours and would be better if I had a bit more time or maybe you can seperate me from this one and just send me something if you like it when you get the vid. What do ya say?&nbsp; I would not show my face but just my lower torso down tto my inner thighs while soaped up in the shower with a cum shot lol<br /><br />Edit: HAHAHAHA holy shit just red this entire thread so no need to re answer my questions that were already ask by MC lol and others. Look ladies I am a little above your average cocksmith and we all know that the bigger and fatter the dick is then it takes more of it being down your throat to keep it hard because it requires more blood rushing to the parts in question. I really don&#039;t have that problem. It&#039;s been about 5 years for me and I don&#039;t really look for sex. My dick gets hard from having good communication and seeing eye to eye with a lady.<br /><br />With that being said every time I eat shrooms my dick hangs low and gets in the way when I walk you know what I mean? <br /><br />But I can see why you all are doing this.&nbsp; When I get into deep conversations with women even without ever seeing them it turns me on and makes me wish I could see them. In a way it proves a theory of mine that sex is just as much a mental thing as a physical thing. But I did post some shit in the spare coins thread about showing a pic of my dick and that was before SR&nbsp; forums went down.<br /><br />I&#039;m serious about the video. Hell yea I&#039;d love to have some more of you all&#039;s great hash it was fucking awesome and lasted me a while. If I do make an authentic video of myself in the shower nice and clean with close ups of my purple headed yougurt slanger and the big balls would you consider sending me some grams?

				In order to claim any prize though, you&#039;d have to link your name + address to a dick pic. <br /><br />What with facebook, and employers.. There&#039;s too many ways this can go wrong.

Do what you want, but the end result will be that someone you don&#039;t know, and have never met, will have a picture of your dick, your name, and your address. This is silkroad. If I&#039;ve learnt anything here it&#039;s that you can&#039;t trust anyone with any certainty.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ordinarily I would agree with you but I have ordered from the scurvey crue already anyway lol so they done got my info once and I didn&#039;t get busted for it and their hash is delicious.&nbsp; love contest like these and others. After reading bout this one I was thinking of offering a cash prize for the best doggy style picture of a woman in doggy style position legs spread wide lol and of course I wouldn&#039;t want to see anybody that looked like they had buck wheat in a leg lock so a good trimmed would be in mind but a natural vagina with a small amount of hair un shaved is gorgeous to me<br /><br />edit: Thanks TB the nick name was a trial and no body had it! WTF? so yea I loved it right away and could not believe no body had it.&nbsp; Yea my real name is Micheal Hunt lol but fucking ace knows better then that because he sent me the hash lol.<br /><br />And really you liken your self to the lady from Weeds? I would actually consider meeting you in person. Do you ever watch Weed Nation?

				OMFG, I have seen so many dick pics this weekend... I think I might have set myself up for a lifetime of disappointment. Seriously. Unless someday we can all stop skirting around the security issue and fuck each-other already. JUST KIDDING.<br /><br />Now, first of all, you guys should know that it took us girls about 4 hours of deliberation last night. And the results were not unanimous ...<br />seems some of us like different aspects of the dick... I would share but it&#039;s kinda like a girl talk thing&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />First Place: ZipStyle<br /><br />Second Place: Tool<br /><br />Third Place: dothedamnthing<br /><br />Honorable Mention: Trappy&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />OKAY: here&#039;s the deal. SIZE DOES NOT MATTER (sorry ianflemming). We chose these particular dick picks because the MEN BEHIND THEM took the time to be unique and different. We are girls... we like to feel special. And even in a DICK/OFF these boys were able to mind fuck us as well as show off their member&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />So, here&#039;s my opinions, and I&#039;m sure the other girls will chime in , too :)<br /><br />I must say that I REALLY liked seeing TB alongside Tool&#039;s happy trail. sexy as fukkkkkkk<br /><br />Loved dothedamnthing because he wrote us a lovely poem to go along with his (impressive) member :)<br /><br />And Zip... can&#039;t give too much away here, but if you ever get a chance to see it, TAKE IT. omfg boyyyy&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />WINNERS: PGP your addy to The Scurvy Crew on SR. Put DICK/OFF in the subject line&nbsp; (you, too, Trappy&nbsp; ;) )<br />

				Very reminiscent of when a beautiful woman I&#039;d been seeing fed me an oxy as a &quot;reward,&quot; after some quality sex. I still feel slightly whorish, but in a good, kinky way.<br /><br />&lt;3

				Its the intellectual side of SR that draws me in<br /><br />And I took a photo of mine but some sparrow flew dew down and took it.<br /><br />Do I get a prize for just admitting I&#039;ve got an average dick size and cannot photo it as I&#039;m pretty shy and would never a photo of my dick online - old fashioned.<br /><br />&nbsp;:D<br /><br />But, its a laugh for sure and a little glimpse for the lady judges.<br /><br />And for hash, boy its tempting but the missus would cut it off,
