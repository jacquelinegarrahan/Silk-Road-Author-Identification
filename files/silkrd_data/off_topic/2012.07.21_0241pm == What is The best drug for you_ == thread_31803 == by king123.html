				It always varies for me. For a period of time I used to love DXM +weed combination (+600mg). Recently found aout about SR and took some acid and I love that even more. Weed is also really good for relaxing and I do that about 2 times a month for a week or so about 3-6 times a day. Opioids are good, but they just dont give me the thing that I&#039;m looking for, and I know how bad opioids can be if you get addicted to them.

				My favorite is weed.&nbsp; When I use it in moderation, it doesn&#039;t have any long or short term side effects.&nbsp; It is the most interesting plant in the world with all the different strains, looks, smells, and effects.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong I love stims, but when I don&#039;t have any or know I have to take a break from em, I love the fact I can get sativa strains that have similar effects(atleast it curbs my stim habit).&nbsp; I also love how you can get indica for when you want to just get stoned or help with any pain...I love Mary Jane.<br /><br />

				A couple months ago i would have said opiates, but now after battling a terrible dependance i would say they are the worst drug for me. (but they make me feel the best) Now after kicking my opiate habit i would say that weed is the best drug for me because it doesn&#039;t have many negative effects on my life and it makes me feel great not to mention i can use it every day.

				Man I just love psychedelics and nothing is really better than a good old acid trip, but it can be really draining and I don&#039;t do it more than one a week, at the very least.&nbsp; I love drinking, I can drink all damn day and smoke while I&#039;m doing it.&nbsp; I guess those are the ones I do the most, but shit I love some uppers as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck it I like all of them.

				For tripping, DMT. Nothing can compare to it; I can&#039;t even describe my trips with words.<br /><br />For general use of any kind, Salvia. Partially because I love the trip, and partially because I get an afterglow that lasts the rest of the day which feels identical to weed. I feel like I&#039;ve smoked a gram and it doesn&#039;t go away until I sleep; it&#039;s basically a free high.

				Best... best...<br /><br />Well I haven&#039;t broken through on DMT yet, though I look forward to it. It isn&#039;t, though, something I would do more than once a week to once a month.<br /><br />I think I have to go with LSD, since I would delight in a chance to spend a week or longer acid high (not tripping for that long, just acid high). It&#039;s as euphoric as MDMA for me but so much more fulfilling.

Personally, I find shrooms to be relatively chaotic and reality-distorting (in good and bad ways), while acid feels more like reality-enhancing. You also get the chance to be high on a powerful psychedelic at sub-tripping doses, a whole other experience than tripping and something I don&#039;t feel I get with shrooms since the reality bending starts relatively easily.

				Well I would say MDMA but my tolerance requires me to have 3 quarters of a gram and I don&#039;t get euphoric rush anymore. I&#039;m currently on a break from it (haven&#039;t done it for just over a month) and hope to return to it in the next couple of months.<br /><br />Weeds pretty good I suppose, but I think it&#039;s overrated and I hate kids that talk about it because they think it&#039;s &#039;cool&#039;. <br /><br />I like mushies &amp; LSD as well.

The price would be too high for it to make sense (with the exception of fent)<br /><br />Benzos: yes maybe - but the benzo effect usually isn&#039;t what the MDMA user is looking for. Plus the side effect of amnesia would make people forget how much of a good time they had, and thus, it would effect the feedback of the quality of the pill (in theory)<br /><br />Alcohol - As far as I know, the laws of chemistry would not allow this<br /><br />SSRIs/MAOIs/anti-depressants - Possible, but would not make sense. These drugs usually decrease the potency of an mdma trip and would cause other unwanted side effects. A pill presser who presses pills with these anti-d&#039;s would surely be run out of business due to horrible feedback of the buyers<br /><br />Kratom - No. Not chemically feasible as far as I understand<br /><br />That&#039;s all that comes to mind. There&#039;s many other things that press tabs can be cut with, but as far as physically addictive substances there&#039;s not a long list.<br /><br />PCP/Meth/MDPV/most other cuts are not physically addictive as far as I know. Most people addicted to E are addicted mentally i think

				I enjoy MDMA. That is above all my favorite. The only downside is the inability to take it every week. I&#039;ll take about 300mg every two months or so. I don&#039;t want to burn out any serotonin receptors or anything, or increase my tolerance.<br /><br />My second favorite is LSD. Two days between sessions due to tolerance is awesome. It&#039;s just so god damn expensive to ship here to the U.S from overseas. <br /><br />My least favorite, is DOB. Fuck DOB in the ass. I took 2.6mg the other weekend, and I had to turn off all the lights and put on calming jazz music to calm myself down. I wasn&#039;t freaking out, but if I looked at lights or trippy pictures I puked immediately, and I puked hard. It hurt. I&#039;ll never take DOB again. <br /><br />MDMA and LSD all the way. I&#039;m taking 2C-B for the first time this weekend and hope to have another favorite soon. I also enjoy DMT for the experience, but not the taste.

				People who post their favorite drug list should also mention which drugs they tried. To say &#039;something is best&#039; you have to compare.<br /><br />My list:<br />1. MDMA<br />2. LSD<br />3. Weed (one sort I&#039;ve tried in India, which was much better than indian hash)<br />....<br />Alcohol<br />Cocaine (maybe it was bad cocaine, but it wasn&#039;t fake one) <br /><br />That&#039;s all I ever tried so far.

				Following the same format as NeuroRelativizer, as this is an interesting thread:<br /><br />5. Cannabis (just a bowl, i have low tolerance for this)<br />7. DXM (not sure how much I took, this was back in the day when I didn&#039;t give a shit about what was put in my body)<br />1. Ecstasy (usually take about 150-200mg, with a redose somewhere during peak. lately i&#039;ve been plugging)<br />2. LSD (doses are usually 200mcg, one of my favorites)<br />3. DMT (1 or 2 puffs, measured out at 30mg)<br />6. Shrooms (these guys are creepers, I ended up taking 6 grams as the original 3 grams didn&#039;t kick in within 2 hours)<br />8. DOB (fuck this drug, 2.6mg, and it freaked me the fuck out)<br />4. 2C-B (relaxing, it&#039;s like a combination of LSD and MDMA. feels like a candyflip)<br />9. Heroin (took around the same time period as DXM, don&#039;t know how much. friend injected it for me, did not enjoy)<br />10. Cocaine (did a line of 100mg, i enjoyed the rush, but the come-down was rough for me, and i didn&#039;t like feeling hyped up)

				I guess it would be those, which if taken in moderation, could either have an innocuous or even beneficial effect on health and wellbeing. There would include:<br /><br />Alcohol - especially red wine (antioxidant)<br />Caffeine - especially tea / green tea, also for antioxidant properties<br />Cannabis - various medicinal properties (best if vapourized or smoked without mixing with tabacco). There is also strong anecdotal evidence that it can aid the creative process.<br />MDMA (for social and emotional benefits)<br />LSD (for expansion of conceptual thresholds and unlocking creativity)<br /><br /><br /><br />

Alcohol isn&#039;t an antioxidant, and in fact some degree of its toxic effect can be mitigated by getting extra antioxidants in your diet.<br /><br />I was surprised to google caffeine and find that it may have antioxidant properties. Either way, including caffeine for health benefits would have me saying just tea, esp green tea, maybe a coffee, no soda or energy drinks. Those one drinks for enjoyment more than health.
