				<br />Not that i would do it myself but are the effects that similar that no one would tell the difference?<br /><br />I think i was sold some &#039;LSD&#039; that was really Nbome......but how can one tell which is which, as the effects i felt were like LSD?!<br /><br />Please help people! :) I dont want to get duped again.

				NBOMe tastes funny (makes my mouth go numb too) and you have to leave it in your mouth for an hour while not swallowing saliva for it to work properly but LSD you don&#039;t and it has no taste either.<br /><br />As for the effects if you&#039;re well versed in both I believe it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to tell just from the effects as NBOME has a different &quot;coming up&quot; rush to it (only tried the 25i up to now) the visuals are slightly different and also acid is a much cleaner, introspective trip imo.<br /><br />Hope that helps a little.
