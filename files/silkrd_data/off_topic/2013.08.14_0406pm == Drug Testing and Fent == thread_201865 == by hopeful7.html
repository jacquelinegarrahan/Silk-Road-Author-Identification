				Not sure where to put this, and I am hoping someone can give me some answers.<br /><br />I went to the clinic to pick up my monthly meds, and they sprung a U.A. on me.&nbsp; This surprised me, because they typically do this during an appointment, not just when I am running in to pick up my scripts.<br />My script is for morphine, but I had run out before the end of the month, so I used a fent/duragesic patch to get me through the last few days. I did save a few pills to take that morning just in case I was to get a U.A., and I am very glad I did.<br /><br />My problem: everywhere I research online says something different: YES, fent will definitely show up in a U.A. and NO WAY, fint just does not show up in a U.A.&nbsp; It is driving me crazy, because both seem so sure of their answers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do remember MANY years ago when I was at a different pain clinic, all I had was fent when I went in, and they were upset with me, because they said NOTHING showed up in my system. But that was years ago and a different clinic.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am scared.&nbsp; I am a pain patient who lives in fear of being &quot;cut off.&quot;&nbsp; I hate that we have to worry about all this B.S. on top of being worried about health, but it is what it is.<br /><br />My only other problem could be that my morphine levels come out too low.&nbsp; Also, will they call me right away or just tell me I can&#039;t pick up my script when I go in to pick them up next month?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an actually appointment until the first part of October.<br /><br />Any help toward peace of mind will be greatly appreciated.

				I can only think if there was a problem you would have known and been denied today..it really depends what kind of testing they do..I find it hard to believe it is anything more then the instant crap they do in office, and since you had morphine in your system, I think thats what they were looking for..the more the test picks up the more expensive they are..but they are (sounds to me) covering their asses by trying to make sure their patients are not diverting their meds.<br /><br />I am sure you showed a positive for opiates, do you think they actually are spending the money to send away to see which opiates are in the urine? That is the question I think..<br /><br />btw..I have been thru a ton of tests, I mean a ton, as a suboxone patient, and usually that is just a good old pee in the cup test, one dr over the years did test for bupe itself, but the rest of the time its just making sure there are not any positives at all. <br /><br />

				hopeful, I feel your pain.&nbsp; I have been through similar &quot;fears of being cut off&quot; from done clinics and sub drs.&nbsp; In a truely free country, no person would ever hold that power over another human being.&nbsp; Would you let us know what happens?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious about how fent is tested for as well.&nbsp; In all the UA and swabs ive ever done has anyone ever mentioned fent specifically.&nbsp; Any idea how many panels the test is?

It is really frustrating to read such definitive answers on the web, each side strongly believing they are correct.<br /><br />I was allowed to take my med slips today, because they had not yet tested the sample. I picked up my slips, did the U.A., and they did not ask me to wait:&nbsp; I was out the door.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, I hate feeling anxious about all&nbsp; this .&nbsp; I have no idea what test they are using at this specific clinic.&nbsp; I have had U.A.s there in the past, but never anything to worry about in the past, because I was taking everything as prescribed and nothing extra.&nbsp; I am always ready when I go to my appointments, but this caught me by surprise, since I was just picking up my med slips that day.

This place does seem a lot better than one I went to in the past as far as being judgmental and more understanding, but one never knows. I have read instances (online, of course) where people&#039;s doctors wanted to keep them, but said due to the DEA pressures, they had to let them go when they found something they should not have found. But, again, not really sure how this place would handle anything like that.<br /><br />I did have ONE good doc at the other clinic, but she left. I remember once when Vicodin showed up and it was not supposed to. I had been to the dentist. She was so understanding, and she said, &quot;Oh, you are probably just under so much stress lately, that you forgot to tell us you went to the dentist.&quot;&nbsp; lol!&nbsp; She said that before I could even try to come up with an excuse (but I really had been to the dentist).<br /><br />I am going to try to keep thinking positive and hope for the best!

				I just hope it turns out ok for you..worrying about all that is really tough ..<br /><br />The best you can do is not worry, its done, and worrying wont change a damn thing now. At the very worst you have access here until you could find another dr..and with the sub Drs, I know they actually (some) allow 2 dirty tests before they kick you out of the clinic. So one mistake, if caught, hopefully not the end of your care with them..<br /><br />

I want to say I really appreciate that. I don&#039;t share with many friends and family that I am on a pain management program, due to the stigma, so I don&#039;t have a lot of people I can go talk to about my worries and concerns.&nbsp; So I first want to say thank you to ALL!<br /><br />And you are right. I can&#039;t worry about something that is already done. Waiting is tough, but there is nothing I can do but be prepared either way.&nbsp; I just really hate to ruin a good thing, because I like this clinic SO much more than I did the one I went to years ago, plus I participate in other methods of trying to find relief from pain at this clinic, such as biofeedback and acupuncture.&nbsp; The combination of everything has really helped me get back &quot;among the living.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as having here, I am an infrequent buyer, and scraping up money is difficult for me at this time, too, but if I have to, I will find a way!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I was hoping to obtain some more definitive answers, but I guess there are just too many yariables to be able to that, and I completely understand that, too.<br /><br />&nbsp; I&nbsp; promise to keep you all posted.

				As far as Fent showing up, maybe both answers you found were right, It&#039;s possible that fent shows up , but, only if it is one of the&nbsp; drugs that that particular test looks for. Maybe not all UA&#039;s test for fent .
