				You know what we should totally do?<br /><br />Start an art community here on SR. We should find and/or recruit a bunch of artists, and treat them well, commissioning them to draw trippy things, cute things, whatever would reflect the culture here.<br /><br />A people can be measured by their art and culture. I think this goes for us as well.<br /><br />I am definitely not representative of this community, however, I think it&#039;s past time to start enriching the Silk Road Experience.<br /><br />We could also use some story authors. However, I am not sure how I&#039;m going to go about finding freelance ghostwriters and editors anonymously.<br /><br />There isn&#039;t really a place I can go to hire them.

				I hope that the name you use here isn&#039;t the furry name you use in the fandom.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s tempting to want to become popular here by using a furry persona to stand out, but it&#039;s not a good idea to advertise personal details about your furry persona here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please understand me-- you seem like a nice guy.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying all of this to be condescending or to stifle you.&nbsp; This is the Off Topic sub-forum so you can obviously do whatever you like, unless the moderators decide otherwise.&nbsp; But please proceed with caution for your own sake.&nbsp; <br /><br />The anonymity of using a furry pseudonym to post art and write stories is just a way to do it without using your real name, so that co-workers, employers, family and others won&#039;t immediately connect it with you in RL.&nbsp; At most it is like an open secret.&nbsp; Even if someone connects your furry persona to your real name, it&#039;s not really a big deal, because being a furry isn&#039;t breaking any laws, and you won&#039;t get arrested for it. <br /><br />The Silk Road is NOT the same thing.&nbsp; The majority of people who post on these forums do not want their personal lives associated with this place in any way.&nbsp; And for very good reasons.&nbsp; We&#039;re not here to express ourselves artistically, or to make close bonds.&nbsp; People can make friends here, I&#039;m sure it happens, but that&#039;s not what this place is about (for the most part).&nbsp; <br /><br />Can you imagine trying to have a Silk Road convention? :-)&nbsp; Not gonna happen.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;re familiar with how furry artwork is distinctive to each artist.&nbsp; You recognize an artist right away by their style-- it&#039;s like a fingerprint.&nbsp; Given that, do you really think it&#039;s a good idea for people to have their artwork permanently listed on these forums? There are plenty of drug-related message boards and forums on clearnet, and probably plenty deep web sites, now that I think about it, where it would be more appropriate.&nbsp; Talk is talk, but this place is to help facilitate actively breaking the law [a labor of love for many of us :)].&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m an artist myself.&nbsp; I would have loved to post my psychedelic stuff here. It was very tempting, even to just post a link to my deviantart page.&nbsp; But as much as I wanted to, I&#039;ll never share it here, any more than I would share my Silk Road experiences with any of my RL friends.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m being paranoid, but I&#039;d rather err on the side of caution.&nbsp; <br /><br />Clearnet search engines now show search results from many onion sites, including these forums, without having to use Tor at all.&nbsp; That&#039;s because of the clearnet sites that provide access to to the deep web.&nbsp; To test it, I just now when I put &#039;Raynardine&#039; into Google in another browser, on the first page of results, the Silk Road forums shows up with your name.&nbsp; In the same results are links to other furry-related posts on clearnet- I don&#039;t know if they&#039;re you, but if so, then they&#039;re connected now, and if I can find it, anybody can do it.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t bother you, then great, don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; It&#039;d make me nervous.<br /><br />But I have to say this-- the furry fandom wouldn&#039;t thank you for associating it with the Silk Road.&nbsp; The fandom is often misunderstood, it gets more than enough bad press already.&nbsp; SR has received increased amounts of attention in the media over the past few years.&nbsp; When that happened to the furry fandom, the controversy was interesting, but it was safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;The people who oppose the Silk Road, however, want to, at the very least, shut us down permanently, and at worst, put us all in jail for a long time.&nbsp; They&#039;re playing for keeps.<br /><br />I really hope I don&#039;t sound like a total asshole. :(&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe I&#039;m wrong. it&#039;s certainly possible.&nbsp; And I have no right to tell you what to post or not to post.&nbsp; I&#039;m just recommending that you be careful with how much of your furry self you bring to these forums, and also probably to avoid posting details of other furries here, no matter how innocuous or insignificant they might seem.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take care, and good luck!<br />-o2

Even so, reading through my own writings has shown me that my writing is fingerprinted, it&#039;s distinctive. To publish under a nym, I can not publish anything whatsoever under any nym that could be compromised.<br /><br />So I understand.

If those who enforce the prohibition had any brains, they&#039;d ignore us. The more attention they draw to us, the more powerful we become.<br /><br />Thirdly, I think that the furry fantasy world has a strong undercurrent of esoteria that would gel really well with the entheogen crowd here on Silk Road. But that&#039;s just my personal opinion.<br /><br />I dislike the mental acrobatics and discipline it takes to hide my true identity when I pour so much of myself into this forum, but if the forces of prohibition weren&#039;t a bunch of neurotic people, I would not have to do this. As it is, I&#039;ll probably carry the secret of my identity to my grave.<br /><br />But yeah, to answer your initial question, no. This is not the persona I use elsewhere.

				The gentrification of SR is underway already! In any &#039;unloved&#039; corner of any vibrant city, the gentrification process is always the same: first the squatters (often addicts), then the artists, then the gays, then it gets all chic and trendy, then its upscale! -meanwhile the original &#039;unloved&#039; inhabitants have long since moved on. Just sayin&#039; :D<br /><br />So we&#039;re in two minds (but that&#039;s not unusual for us).<br /><br />We applaud raynardines imagination and sense of culture and community, we also find much value in the several counterpoints posed by ominuby2, chief being, is this the place for said artistic expression, notwithstanding the commonalities shared by the proposed participants?<br /><br />Having written thus, we offer our cautious support for this &#039;arts village&#039; community on SR.

				&nbsp;I agree with ominuby2, stop while your ahead. Theres plenty of story&#039;s on here to read for the love of god go somewhere that&#039;s for that and leave it there, I see enough mentioning of this place on clearnet so people need to fucking stop bringing this place up outside of it and hinting at shit aint cool.

				If I actually do make some pictures on request, don&#039;t expect outstanding reliability and timeliness, because, as silly as it sounds, Photoshopping has become kind of an emotional thing to me. The planet and sun picture is actually a scene from not just any lucid dream, but from the first shared dream I&#039;ve ever had and I shared that with my first (and only) girlfriend. After we broke up (which I never really got over), I spent weeks in Photoshop, manipulating and playing around with photos we&#039;ve made. I must have wasted hundreds of hours doing that.<br />The planet and sun picture was the last I made and the only one not based on an actual photo but made from scratch instead (and thus the only one I can post here :D).<br />So, long story short, my Photoshopping may suck and/or be unreliable.

				I think this is a cool idea. There has been some blotter art competitions in the past, and some of them produced some cool shit (I made a really cool one with images from Jazz Jackrabbit, but sadly the server I uploaded it to has deleted it, so it&#039;s gone forever). There have been few competitions since, but they didn&#039;t really get any attention. Somebody needs to collect it all tho. I should make an avatar collage...

				To try and blow a little life into this thread once again, I have made a Silk Road forums avatar mosaic, which, coincidentally, is also the perfect size for use as blotter-paper art! I&#039;ve handpicked 900 avatars (sorry if yours isn&#039;t there), resized them a little, sharpened them and tried to make them square (some more successfully than others).<br /><br />If you have any criticism (some significant avatar I&#039;ve missed) or find some duplicates, please let me know!<br /><br />But enough talk, here&#039;s the image (might take a while to load): http://43blp2l646p3w7su.onion/980295052mosaic.png

				I LOVE ART<br /><br />So I wanted to jump in here and say things, but it&#039;s all been said ... I &#039;ll reiterate..<br /><br />nomad sells art on SR :)<br /><br />I want to buy art from Silk Roaders<br /><br /><br />Also, Ballz, bittersweet story... cool (dream sharing, wtf? must be a psych drug thing), but sorry to hear that you&#039;re not over her/it will +1 cheer you up?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-* :-*<br /><br /><br />

One day in the future, when Silk Road is no more, I think it&#039;ll be a nice piece to stumble upon. I hope someone will try to print it on a blotter, I think the individual avatars will look better when they&#039;re only 0,25 inches at 300dpi, instead of blown up on a monitor. And with regards as to how long it took... Let&#039;s just say, I have too much free time on my hands&nbsp; ;)

There are plenty of drug-related message boards and forums on clearnet, and probably plenty deep web sites, now that I think about it, where it would be more appropriate.&nbsp; Talk is talk, but this place is to help facilitate actively breaking the law [a labor of love for many of us :)].<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You have a point there.

There&#039;s the dude who did &quot;I&#039;ll draw anything for $2&quot; (just sketches) and he couldn&#039;t keep up with orders.<br /><br />So I think you&#039;d get two kinds of artists taking this up: dedicated underground artists who don&#039;t mind making a name for themselves on the Road (and the Road itself is not illegal), and people who can put their considerable skills to use drawing/sketching things rather than producing full works. Or, I suppose, trying something new.<br />
