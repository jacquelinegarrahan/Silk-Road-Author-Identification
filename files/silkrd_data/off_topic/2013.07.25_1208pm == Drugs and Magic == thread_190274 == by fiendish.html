				I&#039;ve always reckoned there&#039;s a connection between the two. Certainly had some interesting experiences on different drugs that I would characterize as magical. Very interested to hear from fellow fiends as to your thoughts, magical experiences and general words of wisdom.

				Interesting I actually have done some research on this. Drugs alter your state which anything that isn&#039;t your normal frame of mind is considered trance. While your in this trance you use a different part of your mind as well as your ability to suspend disbelief. Even though you know your on something your brain certainly doesn&#039;t care that&#039;s why some drugs allow for more creativity.<br /><br />In ancient times its well known and documented that monks use use certin herbs and mind altering solutions to help them go deeper into a meditative state and help them use their mind differently.

				I can just speak from my personal supernatural experience. Using cocaine gives me a streak of devastating bad luck. <br /><br />Non-drug related, rubbing fresh mint leaves on my hands/palms and sniffing the crushed mint leaves brings me money from unexpected places, always works.<br /><br />Boiling fresh mint leaf tea in a pot and getting a steam facial from the vapors and then walking around the house with the pot while letting the vapors permeate the living spaces attracts money and success to not only me but also people in the household.

Ice chests, backpacks, towels--did mention it was COVERED??<br /><br />We spent the next month on another planet. We had so many, we tried them just about every way imaginable. <br />We made the usual kool-aid, but also baked them on pizza, made spaghetti sauce,&nbsp; sauteed them on steak chicken etc, boiled them and used the liquid to make ice cubes----we had a LOT of shrooms.<br /><br />So....one night we were trippin pretty hard, when this late evening summer storm comes up. <br />We sat on the dock for what seemed like forever watching HUGE bolts of lightning striking out on the lake. <br />We could see the rain coming across the lake, headed towards us and just before the rain hit, we got hit with this wall of cold wind that was strong enough that kinda freaked us out at first. Once it started raining, the wind calmed down, but the lightning was still going pretty constant, lighting the whole lake up every few seconds. <br /><br />We sat there in the pouring rain, in complete darkness other than the lightning, and in complete silence, other than the occasional thunder clap.<br />The power and beauty of mother nature had us mesmerized for what seemed like hours. <br />Truly, that experience was one of the best I&#039;ve ever had on psychedelics. <br />The feeling of the rain, the lightning, the thunder--all of it was amplified by the shrooms to the point of making it seem almost like a religious experience for me. <br />And somehow while this was happening, without us saying a word, the other three there were experiencing almost the same thing I was, and having the same feelings I was having. <br /><br />Is that magic? I dont know.<br />&nbsp;It sure felt magical, though.<br /><br />I have not really ever tried to explain that night to anyone before because i didnt figure they&#039;d get it.<br />And I&#039;m sure I am not doing the experience justice now. <br />But I have a feeling that if whoever reads this has done shrooms before, they probably understand exactly what I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;
