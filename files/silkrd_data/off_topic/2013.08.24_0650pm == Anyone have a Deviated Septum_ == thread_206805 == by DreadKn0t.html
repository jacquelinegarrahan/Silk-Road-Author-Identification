				Just kinda of bored and was thinking about this. Really random, hence why its off topic.<br /><br />Within the past couple months I was getting a check up done by an oral surgeon. through x rays he had shown me and explained I had a deviated septum in my nasal cavity. Ive heard of this term once before from someone way back when. Any who my dentist told me that it is a pretty normal thing, and in most cases people are born with it.<br /><br />Now what I did not tell my dentist is that I used to snort quite a bit of different substances back in time. Primarily Opiates that was my only real habit. I used to be real big into snorting oxys which progressed to opana then to heroin. I realized how much easier it was to snort through my right nostril because it seemed more open and never got clogged for some reason. After some period of time though I got into shooting it because I did start to feel trauma in my nose after a long period of time snorting so much stuff day after day. I never would have guessed that was potential cause of having a deviated septum up until hearing this news recently. When I was younger(way before any drug use) I used to experience plenty of migraines &amp; dry/bloody noses. now recently I noticed my right nostril always stuffs up in my sleep in the middle of the night causing me to snore(which is something that i never usually do or maybe just never noticed, idk), and occasionally waking up with dried blood in my nostril. <br /><br />For the better part of a year now I have been clean from opiates &amp; indulged occasionally now &amp; then in other miscellaneous non habit forming substances. It was just a real surprising to go to that check up &amp; find out I have a Deviated septum. after all these years. Its nothing Im too concerned about honestly(should I be?), I just felt like posting about it cause the forums here are pretty cool. Its odd that after all these years through &amp; all other dental x rays Ive had in my past, Im NOW just being informed of the condition that I have. Is it possible I was born with this, or is this be something that could have been caused by the excessive trauma I used to put my nose through? Idk, Im no doctor. Feel free to post whatever you feel here, anyone with any type of knowledge on this condition is most preferred. :)

				same here dude, ive had one since high school ( lots of fights and broken noses) so my left side is completely useless. i talked to my doc about having surgery to correct it, but i wouldnt be able to do any blow for weeks until its healed.

				I&#039;ve had it since birth. It makes my right nostril not terribly useful (to snort things). I don&#039;t know much about it other than its harmless and isn&#039;t a serious medical issue.

				I dunno if I was born with a deviated septum or not, not really relevant to the thread. However, my nose has been broken at least three different times, and I had sinus surgery in 1998 to repair the deviation, reconstruct my snooter, smooth out the bumpy uglies, and widen the passages.<br /><br />What prompted me to have the surgery was I couldn&#039;t do blow anymore unless I wanted to smoke it or bang it, neither one being palatable to me at the time, I chose surgery. <br /><br />Now, I can put whatever I want up my nose, most frequently its a finger when I am mining for nose gold.

				word its bizzar cause with me, might right nostril is like my go to nostril is i chose to snort anything up my nose. like its just really open, i can snort stuff without making a sound lol its really hard to describe, but was quite handy when i used to snort dope/or percs in the bathrooms of my old school to stay straight during the day. anyway, its my left nostril that seems to work OK but it can easily get clogged with bacteria and can make it hard to breathe through my left nostril when sleeping. its strange more recently i find myself sleeping but the past like 4 nights or so ive been waking up in the midst of the night and either just my left nostril is clogged or my entire nose and i start to have weird dreams im like, choking. but its me really just having a hard time breathing through my nose while sleeping. then I either wake up taking a gasp of air through my mouth awaking, or i just start breathing through my mouth in my sleep&amp; wake myself up from snoring. i think the cartilage if thats the right word is just really far left in my nose, making my right nostril really open and the left one more claustrophobic. idk but i think its nothing to serious along with the doc. I just find it really wacky, and useful if im snooting stuff. lol&nbsp;

				One of my good friends had a Deviated Septum because he had pretty much an 8-Ball a day habit for pretty much his entire adult life.<br />I&#039;ve never seen anyone be able to snort so much powder - the man was a machine his nose akin to a hoover vacuum cleaner.<br />It&#039;s a shame that his addiction took it&#039;s toll and cost him his life.<br />I miss you buddy! :(

				I &quot;had&quot; a deviated septum for close to 18 years. <br />Didn&#039;t naturally have it but after some middle school sports and some hits to the nose, it ended up that way. And from an early teen-age the seeming problems when lying on one side and not being able to breathe plus the snoring started. <br />Finally after many years of marriage, and wanting to actually breathe when lying on my side, I had an outpatient surgery to get it fixed. The gauze pack up my nose was absolutely unbearable for the first few days, and once they pulled it out, I had some nasty sinus drainage for a few more days after that. But ever since the recovery has been good.<br />Bad news is, it hasn&#039;t fixed the snoring, bu at least when I lie on my side cuddled up to my wife I can breathe. In that respect, it was worth it.
