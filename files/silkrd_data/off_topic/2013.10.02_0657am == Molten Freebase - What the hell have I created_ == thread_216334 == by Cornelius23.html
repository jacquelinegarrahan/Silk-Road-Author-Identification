				BACKGROUND:<br />Some aspects of my life seem to be controlled by obsessive rituals and precision so it might be in reaction to this that I otherwise tend to the opposite extreme of slapdash sloppiness. I&#039;ve previously attempted to make crack by heating coke, bicarb and water in a microwave with poor to mediocre results but last week I found clearer instructions here and decided to try them out.<br /><br />I&#039;d bought some ammonnia but it turned out the non-ionic surfactants in it were soapy. Luckily, having anticipated this setback, I&#039;d also purchased some fresh bicarb so I decided to use Kara&#039;s directions (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.msg1537679#msg1537679) as my guide.<br /><br />MIDGROUND:<br />I put a couple of grams of coke in a polycarbonite shotglass, add somewhere around 0.3g of bicarb and some water from the tap, stir it with a short section of coathanger and put the glass in the pan of heated water. I go back to the computer for a while then return and stir again. I can&#039;t see any clear water at the bottom. In fact, I can hardly see any water at all, so I add some more. Then I add another pinch of bicarb and watch another reaction. Back to the computer than later back to the kitchen and when I stir it the water still doesn&#039;t seem totally clear. I clear some of the gunk away (when I stir it doesn&#039;t clump but just floats in suspension) to sprinkle another bit of bicarb on a more watery area. Another reaction.<br /><br />I continue in this vein for quite a while until finally there are no more reactions. I pour the contents into a bit of bedsheet tucked into the top of a tumbler, along with a little under 0.9g of pre-freebased stuff that had arrived that morning, and let it drain. Then I become a little impatient...<br /><br />I have in the past accelerated the drying of such stuff by placing it on a plate in a preheated oven that I&#039;ve turned off. This time I leave the oven on at around 110°C, pop in the plate with the gunk, close the door and go back to the computer. <br /><br />Sometime later I remember that I have something exciting in the oven. I open the door, remove the plate and... everything&#039;s disappeared! Where did my coke go? There&#039;s nothing left on the plate but a thin transparent puddle. Which is slowly getting stickier. Hmmm...<br /><br />Yes, okay, perhaps I /should/ have known that the melting point is 98°C.<br /><br />FOREGROUND:<br />Sometime later I take the plate out of the fridge and chip from its surface the solid, brittle, glassy lump that now lies where the liquid had been, seeing it whiten as it separates from the surface. I put a bit in a pipe...<br /><br />:o<br /><br />What is this stuff? Is this proper, solid, unpowdered freebase? It&#039;s at least three or four times stronger by volume than anything used by the crackheads I&#039;ve known. Is it just not usually sold like this on the streets because a £10 rock would be too tiny to properly cut and weigh?
