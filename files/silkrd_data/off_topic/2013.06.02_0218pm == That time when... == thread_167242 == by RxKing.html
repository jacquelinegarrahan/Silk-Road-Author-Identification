				Yes LIM/Lebotbahn/thyme... that was it.<br /><br />My only point of bring that up is at that time...a lot of people in the forums believed US direct. And it was a huge deal. It went away. Us direct was a liar. Nomad did nothing wrong...and this forum totally forgot about it. I was bring it up with the drama that was going on last weekend. Meaning all of it means nothing. It will go away. And the truth always seems to come out in here.<br /><br />So you should just come out that your a woman and lie about it anymore :P
