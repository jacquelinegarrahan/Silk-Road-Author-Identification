				Anyone watch &quot;Person of Interest&quot;? Last night, episode 9, they are chasing down a laptop, and Finch says ...<br /><br />&quot;If Demon8 discovers what&#039;s on the laptop he may try to flip it, in which case he&#039;d probably go to the Dark Net, try to sell it on ..Silk Road or one of those black market forums. I&#039;ll try to track him down and negotiate a meeting&quot;<br /><br />Better keep it in Escrow, people be dyin&#039; over that laptop when they don&#039;t.

				Critical Mass, Nothing can stop a movement after it reaches critical mass. The money is made exchanging, not in the selling.

				Yep saw that too. I played it back a few times &#039;cause it was the shit hearing that. <br /><br />Kind of makes you feel proud to be one of the early users of SR. <br /><br />Person of Interest is one of my favorite shows.

				That&#039;s funny that they would mention it. I know right now SR is still pretty underground, but I&#039;m kind of afraid for it if it becomes way more popular.

Dreadful. Fucking dreadful is what that is.<br /><br />If SR becomes the &quot;cool&quot; &quot;underground&quot; pop culture reference du jour, it will motivate every looking-for-their-cause minor politician into a crusade to bring this place down. There&#039;s a reason why they made an example of Tommy Chong.<br />
