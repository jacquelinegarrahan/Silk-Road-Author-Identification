				I know this guy was respected by a lot of you, I think he spat the dummy out a little, but he must still be around. Where are you nomad, have you really turned your back on the community?<br /><br />Are you hear? in all of us. Under a psudenoum? speak to me nomad, it can&#039;t be that bad can it? :o

				He comes around sometimes.&nbsp; He was here since... well, since the beginning basically.&nbsp; He was definitely a mod for awhile, yeah.&nbsp; To make a very long dramatic story very short... he got stripped of his mod privileges, felt like he gave DPR and Silk Road 2 years of his life and sweat and blood and tears... and then got thrown under a bus.<br /><br />The way he was treated made him feel rather bitter and caused him to break ties with the Road.&nbsp; That&#039;s basically the whole story, minus the details.

				Oh, I see. what could possibly upset him so much as too make him capitulate completely? I hope it wasn&#039;t over a post or something silly. I&#039;m sure DPR isn&#039;t unreasonable, and he could of worked through it.<br />Nice to see you&#039;re still about to SS, hows life treating you? you&#039;ve been here a while too eh?

				Well I&#039;ve been using the Road for a year, but I&#039;ve only been hanging around the forums... well, a few months less than that.&nbsp; How is life treating me?&nbsp; Not so bad actually... in fact life itself is treating me awfully well.&nbsp; Some of the people in my life I can&#039;t say the same about, but what can ya do.&nbsp; Sometimes people just don&#039;t want the same things, ya know.&nbsp; Would be nice if -- eh, whatever, I don&#039;t even know where I&#039;m going with this :P<br /><br />I think basically it&#039;s just that Nomad felt like he was a little more than just some random mod.&nbsp; The way I heard it he was here since day 1, but I can&#039;t verify that for obvious reasons.&nbsp; Mods around here... well... that&#039;s a long story too I guess.&nbsp; I mean basically it&#039;s just that Nomad felt like he deserved more respect than he got after all the time he put in.&nbsp; I guess DPR either didn&#039;t agree or didn&#039;t pay enough attention to have an opinion on the matter.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to paint DPR poorly here, that&#039;s not my intention.&nbsp; But you asked what happened to Nomad, and that&#039;s what happened from his perspective.

				He has a few posts in the vendor forum about having dissenting beliefs in Silk Road and said something along the lines of leaving. I&#039;m not sure though. He posted a few in the past couple of days and has logged in recently. <br /><br />Abridged from vendor forum:<br /><br />Currently my IRL time is filled with much more important personal things and frankly my politics simply do not align with Silk Road&#039;s pseudo-agenda.&nbsp; Many know I&#039;ve been unhappy here for quite some time and for me, what&#039;s best is I take a much deserved and earned vacation from this type of activity..... <br /><br />So there&#039;s your answer.

				If anyone deserves a break, it&#039;s Nomad. <br /><br />I remember that episode where all the mods were stripped. Was sometime after some poster/vendor claimed their BTC was stolen from their account and some or all was &quot;donated&quot; to Nomad.

				Nomad was one cool motherfucker. I went through a phase here when I wanted to get advice from some of the older and more active users on certain things, Nomad was the only one who responded. And he didn&#039;t just give me a short response, he&#039;d type out extremely helpful and friendly novel sized answers for me. Of course I tipped him for it but I still feel like I owe him more. Everybody else I sought advice from either ignored me or accused me of being LE looking for info on them. Understandable I suppose.<br /><br />So if you read this, thanks Nomad.

				I liked how he put up ads for &quot;Common Sense&quot; and such. When I first came on-board I gained much knowledge from his posts.<br />He was the only mod I donated to regularly - because he deserved it.<br /><br />Guru is another one that had tons of great info and advice.

				I don&#039;t find anything particularly meaningful to post anything but a few paragraphs in on a good day so if I was a mod and put that much time into answering questions and build up the forum I&#039;d be pretty upset after getting shafted like that.&nbsp; :(

				&nbsp;Nomad helped me greatly on the road, not directly, but by reading his thorough posts and helping me understand the road when I was first starting out. He was funny, intelligent, and witty, and I respect everything he&#039;s done for this community.
