				Right, <br /><br />&nbsp;So if you´re like me you have loadsa drugs lying around that you neither sell or consume. <br /><br />Maybe at one time you really liked mephedrone but now you can´t stand the stuff. <br /><br />Maybe you once were totally incompetent in bed and needed viagra but have since realized that you actually prefer being a woman called Pricilla, and since that sex op you now have no need for the 100 viagra jellies and 60 cilais pills in your med kit.<br /><br />Or maybe you kept that hit of Mescaline for the perfect date with your missus, but she died crying and screaming in a burning car wreck and now you can´t take hallucinogenics. <br /><br />Perhaps you won some shit in a vendor giveaway that you don´t actually really like because your a free riding jizz stain and enter all the giveaways and beg for drugs anyway that you don´t even take. <br /><br />If your a vendor maybe you have old stock that you never sold and can´t be assed to list up. etc.. etc..<br /><br />this thread is meant for getting rid of the drugs that you have and don´t want and exchanging them for drugs that you do like and don´t have. <br /><br />Is this a good idea? if so post what you have and are willing to exchange. <br /><br />for example me: <br /><br />Loads of sex aid pills (we planned on stocking them but there wasn´t the demand at out prices). Mescaline. Hash and opium (My gf is not dead and I have not recently had a sex-op, whats more I hate the name Pricilla)<br />

				Bigbabbablue,Why do you care if its illegal or not?This thread isnt about legal or illegal stuff.Its for if you want to swap some drug you have for another drug someone else has or I suppose some drug for whatever the holder is happy to swap it with?.Gives people a chance to clear out their drawers or perhaps they ordered something and didn&#039;t like it and they still got a load left.<br /><br />Fuckingace,If I could buy mxe cheap nuff,I&#039;d buy it just to swop it for that!! ;)
