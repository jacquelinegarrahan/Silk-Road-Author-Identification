They are experienced and all the ones I met LOVED to FUCK! I am not talking about the lay there and take it like younger girls, they were involved and vocal. The first time I was with an older woman she was 57, after the first hour I was exhausted and collapsed on the bed. She decided it was not over because she did not want it to be over. So she got a washcloth with warm water and wiped me down, then gave me a massage and after 20 min she got me hard again and started all over. That was the first all-nighter I had ever had and is burned into my memory as one of the greatest experiences ever!<br /><br />My advice is, if you can find an older woman. GO FOR IT! You will not regret it.<br /><br />Once you hit 40, younger women start looking good and you get to teach them a thing or two that you learned from the older woman.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

				Hey pickles treat her like she is a young Tart and fuck the shit out of here she will be around for a long time and bend to please everyway possible.Problem is as marriage get older and the relationship slides a pert ( less sex every week ) woman want it to but they don&#039;t want to be considered a SLUT if they talk about it so If you can fill her sexual needs WHY not help out.<br /><br />A lot of people confuse LOVE with SEX love is a feeling of pleasure,happiness and comfort (sounds just like sex Huh Boys )<br />Sex is a craving Men crave sex because they are the Alpha of the species so they will always want sex.<br /><br />I myself have sex 3 times a week and always want more I have told my wife that if she can&#039;t fill the order then she would have to accept that I am going out for some all she said was I don&#039;t want to know about it
