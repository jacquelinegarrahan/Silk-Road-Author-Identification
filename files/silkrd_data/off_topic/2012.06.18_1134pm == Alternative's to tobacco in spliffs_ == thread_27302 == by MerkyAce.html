				Wa gwan Sr, first post here&nbsp; ;D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I want to smoke, but not too keen on filling a blunt full of weed. Just recently, I have given up smoking tobacco, find it pointless tbh, but i used to use tobacco to mix with my blunts.<br />I just want an alternative to mix with my weed, that doesn&#039;t need to have any effect but needs to burn. Even if i only put about .7g of pot in a blunt and mix it with some other herb that burns, i will still be buzzing by the end of it.<br /><br />Tl;dr: Need a long smoke that will get me lightly buzzing, not tobacco and something I&#039;ll have in the house.<br /><br />Merky.

				I have never smoked tobacco, i just put more weed in my spliff&#039;s, you can roll joint&#039;s with as little as .3 g of weed if you want. No need for tobacco at all!

				I&#039;d be careful about what I light up and inhale, some things can give off nasty (poisonous) fumes.<br /><br />You can get smoking mixes to replace tobacco. I&#039;ve seen them in headshops (not legal highs just flavoured mix) but tbh they are prob just as bad as tobacco. <br /><br />Look in the cupboard and tell us what you&#039;ve got.

				You can buy legal smoking mixes. Go to Holland and Barret, they have this honey flavour stuff there. It tastes fucking nice, burns slow, and it&#039;s&nbsp; not a rough smoke at all

				Hi!<br />If you want to quit tobacco search for something like this. I believe they sell pound boxes. <br /><br />http://www.everyonedoesit.com/online_headshop/Knaster_Hemp_Smoking_Blend__35g_Pouch.cfm<br /><br />Or just buy the Volcano!<br />

				I&#039;m not entirely sure about it, but wouldn&#039;t it help to roll with tobacco that comes out of ultra light (0.1 mg nicotine) cigarettes also work? On those cigs they do something odd with the filter as well, but i presume the nicotine content of the tobacco inside the sticks is also lower compared to ordinary cigs or rolling tobacco.

				I think it does not make such big difference. You can toast the tobacco too but that only take the flavor out not the nicotine content.

				You can look into:<br /><br />Kanna<br />Wild lettuce<br />Damiana<br />Blue Lotus<br />Lion&#039;s tail<br />Catnip<br /><br />Most of these are herbs that won&#039;t change your high too much, but some can make the high more euphoric, longer, ect..<br />I only tried out Damiana, Kanna an Catnip and Damiana was the smoothest to smoke (when I remember correctly)<br /><br />Your welcome 8)<br /><br />

				Have you tried toasting your tobacco? I do it with 90% of the spliff i roll, it removes most of the nicotine and carcinogens from the tobacco. It tastes a lot less strong to so you taste the weed better.<br /><br />heres how:<br />put the desired amount of tabacco flat in a foil tray (easily made) this sort of shape:&nbsp; &nbsp;\_/-<br />hold the handle that you have made out of the foil <br />now hold a lighter under the tray with the tobacco in it and heat for 20 seconds at a time, until it stops smoking and turns into a crispy brown colour. <br /><br />now roll your joint with it! ;)<br />

				I use Greengo. It smells nice, isn&#039;t addictive and adds a mellowness to spliffs :)

				I used to mix weed with some sort of cigarettes that I bought in a health shop, of all places. <br />There is no nicotine or tar in them. They are just some sort of herbs that are a replacement for people who like the act of smoking.<br /><br />It burns perfectly and doesn&#039;t taste too bad so i&#039;d look into them.<br /><br />Here is a link to give you an idea. You may not be able to get them where you are from.<br /><br />http://www.thenaturalway.ie/Herbal-Products-Herbal-Cigarettes/

				Frankly i don&#039;t believe the &#039;no tar&#039; part of that. Any smoldering vegetable matter will produce tar, tobacco does, lawn grass does, anything else you can cut from a plant that burns does. <br /><br />Herbal cigarettes may be free of tobacco and nicotine, but the mainly dangerous part of the smoke, tar, will always remain to some degree, no matter what other plant material you substitute for the tobacco. Obviously the pot itself will also produce tar, which is fairly evident when you roll a joint with pure cannabis and look at the tip after smoking it.
