				I am taking LSD and a male friend will sit me. He has a girlfriend and I have a boyfriend. I am wondering if there is a risk that I will try doing something inappropriate with him when I&#039;m on LSD? I&#039;m also wondering if there&#039;s a risk I might say very personal things to him? Things I might wish I had kept to myself afterwards. We have known each other since we first started high school. We are close. We&#039;ve been intimate in the past. What do you have to say?<br /><br />(You may also add fun LSD activities if you like.)

				Why don&#039;t you just decide in your own mind that nothing untoward will happen?<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty simple really. Make a decision and have the resolve to stick to it even in times of a changed perception. It&#039;s called self respect :)

I didn&#039;t know if this was possible to do on LSD as I&#039;ve never taken LSD before. Of course my mind is already determined to not do anything embarrassing. To take an example I&#039;ve never done or said anything embarrassing that I regret after drinking alcohol, so for me alcohol is a drug which lets me stay in control. Morphine (which I got at a hospital when I had an injury), on the other hand, made me tell my mother things I normally wouldn&#039;t have told her and that I partly regretted afterwards (wasn&#039;t anything bad, but not a motherly topic), so I don&#039;t feel in control if I&#039;ve taken morphine (my morphine &quot;trip&quot; wasn&#039;t planned though so that could make a difference in my ability to keep myself from being embarrassing).

Though out of curiosity what dosage are you planning on playing with?<br /><br />I&#039;ve never found myself crossing boundaries that I knew were a bad idea on anything but alcohol. Perhaps my dosages have been too low? Given some good Albion I can hardly talk, let alone come onto someone who&#039;s not tripping. Though having sex with someone you&#039;re really into while you&#039;re both on acid, well that&#039;s just the bees-knees (and perhaps something you can put on your list for when you&#039;re more comfortable with acid) :)<br /><br />As for ideas, my favourite things to do are listen to instrumentalish (ambienwave, even Sigur Ros, etc.) music, go for walks in parks, and trip out on nature. You could even have him read to you for a little. Given the right kind of poem / short story, this may be pretty awesome. Nothing too long though. Have fun!

				The idea that all it takes to &quot;prevent&quot; embarrassing &quot;events&quot; on LSD is a little self-respect and resolve defeats the very notion of LSD, dunnit now?

				again, skimmed the thread. don&#039;t try to control what happens on your trip, let lady lucy decide. She usually knows whats best. just let her wash over your entire mind, and let the trip guide what it wants to be. people over think this way too much. just go with her. nobody can prepare for their first time of having the veil lifted, so why try to plot your course. just set the basics. i.e. nature walk, music (whatever kind trips your trigger, but I suggest NIN and buckethead, and if I&#039;m gonna be honest with you, some dave matthews, specifically squirm from big whiskey) and leave the rest of your reservations at the door. your trip is gonna be what it&#039;s gonna be, so don&#039;t rule out sex with your friend, could be just what lucy wants. point is if you try to control Lucy, she will make you her bitch, but if you let her guide you, wonderful things are possible.

				My take is that whatever happens on LSD is for the greater good, even if it doesn&#039;t seem so at the time. Even on bad trips when I freaked out.. it made me face demons and come out stronger in life. At other times I went ahead and told some people exactly how I felt about certain things that I would never do &quot;sober&quot;. However, again, that was immensely liberating. Because those thoughts (demons) sit at the back of your head throughout your life and you never have the courage to face them. Getting them out and speaking the truth, no matter if it&#039;s offensive or &quot;inappropriate&quot; always ends up being for everyone&#039;s good down the line.

				OP, I&#039;ve tripped with and without people, and every time I&#039;m with sober people I usually feel a lot more sober myself. So I personally don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have any difficulty controlling yourself if that&#039;s what you&#039;re worried about, especially on a relatively low dose.<br /><br />Having said that I don&#039;t like tripping by myself. I would much rather be alone so that I can do embarrassing shit all day long, as long as I&#039;m somewhere safe of course.<br /><br />Good luck :)

At other times I went ahead and told some people exactly how I felt about certain things that I would never do &quot;sober&quot;. However, again, that was immensely liberating. Because those thoughts (demons) sit at the back of your head throughout your life and you never have the courage to face them. Getting them out and speaking the truth, no matter if it&#039;s offensive or &quot;inappropriate&quot; always ends up being for everyone&#039;s good down the line.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking too, about facing the demons. I am brutally honest with myself in life and there&#039;s nothing I lie about, so I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t have to spend the trip confronting issues. If that&#039;s the case, though, I will gladly do it because I would hate carrying demons around all my life. Still, I&#039;d hope I&#039;d keep what&#039;s inappropriate to myself, because he doesn&#039;t need to know stuff I consider private. If I do start ranting about anything private, though, it will still be okay because my feelings for him are good (I won&#039;t say I hate him :) ) and he already promised that he won&#039;t pass on any secrets that might leave my lips.

So I personally don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have any difficulty controlling yourself if that&#039;s what you&#039;re worried about, especially on a relatively low dose.<br /><br />Having said that I don&#039;t like tripping by myself. I would much rather be alone so that I can do embarrassing shit all day long, as long as I&#039;m somewhere safe of course.<br /><br />Good luck :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My dose is now changed to 196 micrograms!

				My first trip was 400ug and it was so visually intense I sat in a chair from the time the visuals started till they went away 5 hours later with my jaw dropped and mind blown. Nothing crazy happened but I think it was due to the quality at the time, all of my trips after that have been nothing but mind fuck.

I want to be a bit more interactive with the world during my trip, though.
