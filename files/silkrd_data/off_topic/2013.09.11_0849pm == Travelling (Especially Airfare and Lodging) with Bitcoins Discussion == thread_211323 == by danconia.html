				So I am noticing now that there are websites that are willing to take Bitcoins to buy plane tickets and also some individual places / hotels take BTC to pay for your stay.&nbsp; Here are some examples:<br /><br />Airfare:<br />http://travelforcoins.com/agodabook.php<br />http://travelforcoins.com/book.php<br />https://btctrip.com/ (looks like it&#039;s not working right now)<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to list the sites for hotels right now because most seem like they are sites for individual hotels / apartments.<br /><br />Has anyone used BTC to purchase airfare or lodging before?&nbsp; If so I would love to hear how it went.&nbsp; There might even be a secondary market for people willing to buy plane tickets (for someone else) for BTC.&nbsp; My most pressing question is: since hotels and airfare typically need to know your real name and information... what are the legal implications that need to be considered?&nbsp; For instance if I were to purchase $10k-20k worth of airfare (with BTC) during the course of a year will the government be able to match the airfare cost with my identity and get me in trouble if I haven&#039;t declared that income?<br /><br />Would love any thoughts on this topic.&nbsp; I have a flexible job and can work from anywhere so I have a lot of plans for traveling this year.<br />

				I cant see the tax dept going that far into every transaction or no one would get returns for years&nbsp; <br /><br />Funny you say there could be a market for people buying tickets etc under incorrect names then state they need your real name etc?<br /><br />Are you mining them if so its a hobby no tax required
