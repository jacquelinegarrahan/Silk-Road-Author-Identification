				hey, so... are we allowed to talk about other mail-order marijuana providers on here? so many forums crack down on this, but the SR is such an anarchic paradise that it seems maybe acceptable here.<br /><br />if so can we talk about the legitimacy of, say, the two most well-known clearnet providers, BM and BB.biz? (note that I am not asking whether they are legit, which may not be allowed on these boards, but only whether I can ask... ha, ha.) I know the former site is legit, but not sure about the latter. Have never ordered from either.<br /><br />BM.biz is just amazing in terms of selection, if only they would deal in BTC... their payment methods are slow and frustrating. BB.biz has recently started accepting Interac email money transfers, to be sent to an address published on clearnet. To me this seems like a HUGE security risk, and an indication either that they are a scam or they are positively itching to get popped. <br /><br />anyway, since the selection of Canadian trees at reasonable Canadian prices is apparently gone from here for the time being, I&#039;m considering jumping through all the hoops to order from BM. would be interested to know if any other silkroaders had experience with either site.
