				Hello,<br /><br />i have 2 M.D.s in medicine, I&#039;m specialised in plastic surgery and oncology, I work discrete, private and anonymous with my team of me and 2 trusted and qualified surgery assistants, all surgeries will be performed in a sanitized environment under general anesthesia<br /><br /><br />i can offer you up to 5 cm firm length, at a rate of about $1000-2000 per centimeter, depending on your current length and bend of your penis <br /><br />if you also want to increase your girth, an increase of 0.5cm or up to 1cm is possible, the cost of this would be $2500+<br /><br />another thing i could offer is a straightening, if you are bend and want that, but keep in mind this procedure will actually decrease your size a bit (usually 0.5 to 3cm, depending how bad it is) for a flat 2000$<br /><br />the prices will also very depending on what kind of implant you want.<br /><br />all those offers can be combined ofc, the prices I listed are estimates, for a final price i need to examine your phallus first, if you want an appointment for a professional examination you will have to put up a 500$ safety deposit, which will be subtracted from the total cost if you decide to go into surgery, if you decide not to the safety deposit will be voided.<br /><br />Sometimes its necessary to perform multiple surgeries for the wanted results (especially for bigger size increases, if you want your penis still be as sensible as before[it will become a bit less sensible, but not much if the surgery has been performed properly])<br /><br />Another thing I will include, if you decide to get your penis enlarged by me, is detailed instructions for physiotherapy for the first 3-5 weeks after the surgery, you can perform without any expert help at home. (For optimal results I strongly recommend following this for at least 3 weeks, the therapeutical exercises are performed progressively, depending on how well your physiotherapy goes)<br /><br /><br />SPECIAL OFFER:<br />If you decide to use my services, and the cost accumulates to at least 3500$ i will throw in an vasectomy for free!<br /><br /><br />
