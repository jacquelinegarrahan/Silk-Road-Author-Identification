				Today I got a gram of Green Crack in the mail. I ordered a ton of items over the 420 sale but I am sure a gram weed was not one of them.. I even double checked my order history, no orders finalized while I was drunk haha.. So it was a pleasant surprise today (especially since none of my money making orders came).&nbsp; I have been sampling several different weed vendors and none of them have been listing green crack to my knowledge.<br /><br />It was packaged very different from what I have gotten before, but very well done.&nbsp; When I finally got past the layers of different bags and wrappings, the containing bag said Happy 420 and had a smiley face.. <br /><br />So thank you! whoever you are, this bud is FIRE!

				Doesn&#039;t that mean someone got your address...? If it&#039;s not from a buyer you already bought from, it could be pretty bad.<br />Otherwise, enjoy it! =]

				good point, It must have been like customer appreciation from a previous vendor. IDK, you would think they dispose of the addys.. I will have to check again.. Only way I could see myself picking up a G would be if it was only 1-2 btc for an entry in the 420 prizes..
