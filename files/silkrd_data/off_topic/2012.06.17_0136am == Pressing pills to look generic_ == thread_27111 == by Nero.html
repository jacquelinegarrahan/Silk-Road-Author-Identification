				Hey guys,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always wondered this and would like to see if people can shed some light.<br /><br />&nbsp;Why don&#039;t pill pressers press pills to resemble generic drugs? I understand that in the beginning it would be difficult to market these pills, because frankly, you&#039;re selling Ibuprofen. But just like with any other press, word of mouth gets around fast and people would be gobbling these things up like candy.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be stupid easy to smuggle these pills? I think it would be.<br /><br />Are pill pressers afraid of the pharmaceutical big guns getting involved?<br /><br />Its also far easier to conceal. Hmm, what do you have in your pocket, son? a pill that looks like generic 200mg naproxen or a pink pill with a playboy bunny on it...<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				I think the reason this isn&#039;t done is exactly what you said. Even if word of mouth got around, what would stop people from simply selling their Tylenol and saying it&#039;s E? <br />

				A way to get around this is to have a specific phrase or alphanumeric combination on them. I think that would be pretty effective.

				I suppose there might be a market for it if they got it down to a science. But I dunno, part of the experience of taking e to me is getting all of the different presses. I mean, e pills with a triforce on them? How fucking awesome is that?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I would start a collection if they all didn&#039;t look so irresistibly delicious...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27111.msg294060#msg294060">Quote from: Vinnyg007 on June 17, 2012, 03:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Simple, I&#039;d rather buy the pill with a playboy bunny on it than the one that looks like Tylenol.

				Noone would take them, that&#039;s why.<br /><br />Dodgy dealers would be selling you the cheaper real drug such as Asprin and not MDMA, and you&#039;d be overdosing on Asprin or whatever generic drug you&#039;re referring to.
