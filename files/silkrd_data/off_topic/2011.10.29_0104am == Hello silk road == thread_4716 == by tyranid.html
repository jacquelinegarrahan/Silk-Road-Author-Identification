				Welcome!<br /><br />Read the buyer guide.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t buy bitcoins from anyone on this site. Don&#039;t finalize early unless the vender is super reputable.<br /><br />if your not planning on spending more than $4000 a month, and don&#039;t want to get raped with exchange fees, I recommend dwolla -&gt; to Main Exchange (Tradehill, CampBX, Mt.Gox).<br /><br />If you want your coins now and don&#039;t mind paying 5%, get-bitcoin.com is probably your best bet.<br /><br />If you&#039;re on windows, here is your best bet for PGP guide:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2287.msg18993#msg18993<br /><br />Do not use a fake (unregistered) name on your shipping address.&nbsp; There are people here who will tell you otherwise and I want to punch them in the face. It gives you zero plausible deniability and it is one of the leading factors contributing to undelivered packages on this site. <br /><br />&nbsp;If you simply can&#039;t bare to put your name on an order containing illicit goods, then order 10 cheap legal things to that name from amazon and make absolutely sure your post office doesn&#039;t care. Some don&#039;t, some do.<br /><br />Also, buy your weed from me because I&#039;m the best :D<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Rook
