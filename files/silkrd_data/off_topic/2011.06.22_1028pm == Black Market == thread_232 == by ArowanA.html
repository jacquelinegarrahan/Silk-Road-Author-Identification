				Yep, I agree with both y&#039;all, but it&#039;s like in RL, I&#039;ve had sellers disappear, and I had to go to a different neighborhood, where I didn&#039;t know anybody, and was much more likely to get burnt--and I&quot;ve been burnt, had a gun pulled on me once--but I did it because my need/desire for product made it necessary...I see BM the same way: I actually stuck it out there, and tried more than once, simply because we are safer if there are more sites: just like in NYC in the bad old days, when there was just finally *one* open market, LE closed it down, simply because it was too obvious.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR protects us, but when it&#039;s down, we are wandering the Inet without a guide, can be sketchy...what saved me was finally, someone on BM mentioned and gave the addy of OVDB, and then I got some much needed info...<br /><br />If this place stands alone, it won&#039;t stand long...I do hope I&#039;m wrong...if the feds could give Whitey Bulger almost two decades of free roaming, surely they could give us a year or two...

				It looks particularly dodgy, I&#039;ve been looking at it every so often. <br /><br />Due to all the negative publicity, the admin over there decided to outlaw CP.. encouraging.<br /><br />But they skim 4% off of all transactions.<br /><br />Sticking to the SR. It feels a lot better over here.

				Blackmarket was flooded with scammers right after they went online especially because selling childoprn was tolerated at first.<br />But since that it&#039;s totally renewed and weeded out, every seller&#039;s account has to be approved by the admin personally. <br />Selling childporn is not tolerated anymore so people who avoided BM because of that (like me) can ease up.&nbsp; For the same reason BM is no longer under attack from hackers/scammers.<br /><br />The site itself is just like Silkroad, so it can be an alternative IMHO, especially if they can learn from SR&#039;s mistakes.

				Except the admin cant even speak english. The only reason CP isn&#039;t listed is because he realized he could make more money banning it. He had no problems making money tolerating CP, he made a separate category for it. At least the LEO will have 1 more target. If mybtc gets hacked, mtgox gets hacked, multiple sec flaws in tradehill submitted, I don&#039;t trust his skill. <br /><br />Backopy release source code.<br /><br />Backopy has NO rep in the source scene.<br /><br />Be warned.

				Not everyone on earth speaks english perfectly - including me -&nbsp; but I don&#039;t see why anyone needs to stay away from BM because of this.<br /><br />SR hasn&#039;t evolved for a good while. There is a new sellers system (one needs to pay for a sellers account) that doesn&#039;t really help anyone, it just makes more money for the guy behind SR. <br />Still no rep system for buyers while it&#039;s obviously needed for the safety of the sellers. I also wonder why did SR start to operate without a buyers rep system.<br /><br />I heard SR and Direwolf is a known pedo and also a rat.... <br />OK, he did allow CP because &quot;it&#039;s a free market&quot; and a lot of people left because of that, including me, but now it&#039;s different.<br /><br />If anyone can provide any proof that he is a pedo, or he was DOX&#039;d please do it and then I&#039;ll stay away from that site. How the fuck would anyone know things like that for sure. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t care who will do it or what&#039;s the name of it, but we need other sites like SR.

				If I get ripped here--hell, 3 order didn&#039;t show last week--I don&#039;t put it on SR...I figure I need to be more careful...I got ripped twice when SR was down, over on BM for small amounts...I let bakcopy know over on btc forums, but that was it...I also posted on it in forums there...<br /><br />I still trust the guy: he never actively sought out the CPer&#039;s he just hadn&#039;t set up site correctly, and he--and several of us--paid price.&nbsp; I left because it was no good, but when I saw he&#039;d tried real hard to fix things, I&#039;ll give him another shot, start small, same as here...<br /><br />Also a good forum for new legit sellers, as here it&#039;s hard for sellers to break into the game...<br /><br />Also, it&#039;s *good* that his 1st language isn&#039;t americanese...the more spread out these activities are, the harder it is for LE...<br /><br />This is my main site, but I root for all new sites...hell, a couple of the sellers on here are trying hard to get rid of escrow...haha: I&quot;d bail so fast they didn&#039;t have escrow, and site owners know it...and BM learned it the hard way...and also, he now makes sellers use GPG, and that alone gets rid of most of the retard scammers....
