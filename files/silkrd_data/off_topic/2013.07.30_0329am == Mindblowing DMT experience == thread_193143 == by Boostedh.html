				I hope this is the correct subforum to post this. <br /><br />Me and one of my very close friends used DMT tonight multiple times together.&nbsp; Were avid psychedelic users.&nbsp; But tonight, we decided to do the DMT together.&nbsp; After taking a few hits from the chalet, I blast off into hyperspace.&nbsp; He does the same.&nbsp; My closed eye visuals were a long black hallway with doors, but there were 2 entities, we&#039;ll call them people.&nbsp; They were coming up close into my face and waving their hands about and moving back and forth.&nbsp; Then after the trip subsided, it was if they went through a door in the floor.&nbsp; <br /><br />But what gets me is, after I came out of my 10min closed eye visual trip, so did my best friend.&nbsp; We both at that time tried to describe what we had seen, and it was the exact same visuals and perceptions.&nbsp; Same time length&#039;s and almost to an exact tee.&nbsp; <br /><br />Afterwards, we waited around 2 hours to go outside and sit on my porch and try it again.&nbsp; This time we were going to do opened eye visuals instead of closed.&nbsp; Once again, both shared the same visuals of tree&#039;s, things in the sky, stars, and even noises.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you think that 2 people could share the same DMT trip?

				DMT&nbsp; is next new for me to try.&nbsp; I understandthe buzz, and duration(or lack of it) but what about the leftovers(hangover) after the trip? How long to return base(normal)?

				When smoking DMT, the high is anywhere between 8-20 minutes.&nbsp; Everyone&#039;s different.&nbsp; Me, I usually blast off with 4-5 good hits, am in the spirit world for anywhere between 5-10 minutes depending on tolerance, then back to baseline where I was by 15minute mark

				it is not uncommon for this to happen. I have shared the same experience with a friend of mine once. Honestly when you smoke DMT you shift your alignment with this realm and it gets moved into another. When you teleport you really do go somewhere. I blast off and sometimes lost my physical body and go into other dimensions. I&#039;ve seen other beings, as well as communicated (or at least what I felt was communication, for it was not verbal) with them. <br /><br />on another note, smoking deem while on acid is amazing. lol<br /><br /><br />

				Ive had a shared experience twice with a very close friend, who I have been sync&#039;d with for many years (not just drugs, but many many things). Its definitely real, although for us, it was LSD-25 that opened us up to those realms.<br /><br />On a side note (since dmt on top of LSD was mentioned) for my last journey, I tried dmt 100mg from a synth that my best friend created, on top of my 2c-b peak.<br /><br />I lay in commune with a being from the Pleiadian star system who was an exact image of the crop circle butterfly that was found in the Netherlands. I remember it traveling down from the stars to sit next to me, while it sang the most amazing song, in a frequency way out of the normal range for me. It then lay its hand just above my body and suddenly shot this beam of intense, almost blinding light, straight into my heart chakra. Could literally feel the weight all throughout my chest. After a few minutes it got up and spiraled back into the sky, blending in to the moon.<br /><br />The most angelic/divine experience Ive had on any substance :)<br /><br />PE
