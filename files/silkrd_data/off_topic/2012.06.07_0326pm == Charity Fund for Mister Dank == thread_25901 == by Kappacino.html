			<dd class="postbody">
				I am writing this post not as a joke, or as an attack against his person, but as a call for support from the community to help Mister Dank make some new friends as well as become a functioning member of society.<br /><br />Please read this post here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25899.msg278375#new<br /><br />As shown by this post, Dank is clearly mentally deficient. However we should not condemn him, we should offer him help and guidance. <br /><br />I have set up a charity fund here: 2Th6Jui7BvBEpk51FsHtkOpSt35U11UdwJ2T<br /><br />Please donate whatever you can so we can help Mister Dank with his various disabilities.<br /><br />Mister Dank needs help paying for classes to help with his speech impediment, as well as a new wheelchair (that is able to sustain a weight of 450lbs). <br /><br />I also suggest that we buy him a new dialysis machine, and a few months of diabetes medication to diminish his suffering.<br /><br />In a few months time, we will also need to buy him some size 3 running shoes (his feet are unnaturally small and crooked due to legionnaires disease - I know this from correspondence with his mother), so that he is able to, at some point in the future, go jogging in order to lose weight and make some new friends. <br /><br />After a few months of jogging he may be able to get down to a weight that the hospital will deem as acceptable for them to operate on him, at which point he can get the breast implants and ultimately the estrogen therapy which he has been wishing for and writing about in his diary for years (again I know this from correspondence with his mother). <br /><br />Unfortunately Mister Dank is currently being abused by his landlord, who tells him that instead of paying rent, he must &quot;suckle his lollipoppy pop&quot;. I don&#039;t think this needs any more explanation. Regrettably, Dank is unable to form mental concepts and thought-forms and is unable to tell that he is being sexually abused in this way, his mother and sister both vouch for the fact that he has been watching a single frame of a paused Family Guy DVD for the past 6 years, thinking that he has been watching Jesse Owens win the 200m hurdles on the moon as well as completing every level on Mario Kart. This is patently absurd, as Mister Dank has no hands (they were amputated years ago after a severe masturbatory accident)<br /><br />At first I was dismissive of Mister Dank and his desperate ploys for attention, but now I feel sorry for him and feel a responsibility to offer him help. <br /><br />If he is to become a member of society and perhaps at some point a real person, he needs our help here at SR. Perhaps within 10 years we could help him learn to form coherent sentences, as well as approach people and make new friends. Of course he should not be allowed to breed (his mother in fact told me that Dank has no actual father, he was one of the first unsuccessful test-tube experiments carried out in the 1970s) as this would obviously have disastrous effects for the human gene-pool as a whole.<br /><br />My heart is with you Dank, and I hope you can recover. Please people, donate what you can.

I&#039;ve also got that wart cream you were asking for so hopefully that should help.<br /><br />How are the sores/tissue damage anyway? Has your rectum fully healed yet?<br /><br />I hope you get better soon. I&#039;ve got some good news for you though.<br /><br />I have been talking to your mother, and she and I both think that you need a guardian in your life, an alpha male to set an example for you as well as to deal with your latent electra-complex in preparation for therapy. We have concluded that it is best if I adopt you and become your legal father. To start I am going to change your name to &quot;Matt Rustaine&quot; as I think that better illustrates your true value. This will be a good new start for us Timmy (Dank&#039;s name as of now), and hopefully I will be able to guide you to become a proper person, as your new father.

				I know it&#039;s already been discussed ad nauseam, but I can&#039;t help but wonder what Timmy&#039;s life must be like.&nbsp; I mean, I can&#039;t comprehend what it must take before trolling a forum is an activity worth performing.&nbsp; Does he wake up in the morning and think, &quot;Oh man, I&#039;m SO gonna show those assholes on the forum who&#039;s boss!&quot;?&nbsp; Does he read posts like this one, analyzing his behavior, and even think about what the words mean?&nbsp; Surely some of the things we say when poking fun at him would just so happen to be true, and such instances would probably remind him of the things he dislikes about himself.&nbsp; I would think receiving so much hate would make such a miserable person even more miserable, so to actively seek it out is just...mind-boggling to me.<br /><br />Sometimes we hear explanations for behavior like this.&nbsp; Like when someone&#039;s life is so meaningless and empty, or they&#039;re unimaginably lonely since they don&#039;t know how to make friends, ANY sort of attention makes them feel validated.&nbsp; I guess I just can&#039;t imagine being so pathetic.<br /><br />I also wonder if, when Timmy and others like him read a longish post about themselves (like this thread), it makes them feel good.&nbsp; A sort of, &quot;Even if they hate me, they invested some time in thinking about me, so at least I can cling to that.&quot;&nbsp; Do they let themselves feel like they &quot;won,&quot; that they got us to &quot;waste&quot; our time on their pointlessness?&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel as if I&#039;ve &quot;lost,&quot; typing up this post.&nbsp; It only took a few minutes, and it&#039;s the kind of thing I find interesting, so it was actually quite fun.

				Can i donate a bullet also ? Why not hire a hitmen for Mister Dank ?&nbsp; Hitmans always help - Death-Proof<br /><br />http://2v3o2fpukdlpk5nf.onion/<br />http://tqp6fvfurygkbj3y.onion/<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/snapbbs/63a120b2/threadlist.php?PHPSESSID=s4svkl97o0u713frvfv28up051<br /><br /><br />Welcome: Hitman for hire<br /><br />First to say that this is serious, it is not a joke. If you ask yourself why someone would need to hire hitman online, I will tell you simply: because it is anonymous. You can always find examples of criminals who collaborated with cops when they face 20 years of prison, and you can finish in the prison because of that. At other side, you can always find examples that police found who had interest to kill dead person and they can come to you and you can give testimony and hitman can finish in the prison 20 years. So, it is mutual interest to make everything anonymously.<br />This website is hosted at anonymous server, server access to Internet through Tor network, you can access this site anonymously only through Tor network, and I uploaded files to server through Tor network. You make payment with anonymous digital currency called Bitcoin (currently 1 Bitcoin worth about 7 EUR). It means I don&#039;t know you and you don&#039;t know me. I can&#039;t send you in the prison and you can&#039;t send me in the prison. Of course you must take a risk when you pay in advance, but there is no interest and profit without risk. You take risk and when you do it anywhere, someone can always cheat you and as I said, many criminals have balls to do many things to the other people but when their ass face 20 years of prison they begin to talk with police. Risk about prison and money is always present. If you are not ready to take a risk, don&#039;t contact me. Prices below are in EUR but EUR is facing crisis, so, you should count gold converted in Bitcoins. 5000 EUR is 120gr of gold, 10000 EUR is 240gr of gold and so on. One gram of gold has value of 41,73 EUR or 52,83 US Dollars.<br /><br />1)If you hire me in EU countries, you pay me 5000 EUR in advance to prepare everything for action (I buy new gun for every action, stolen car/motorcycle, I must pay rent for garage and flat for some period). If you want target eliminated out of EU, then you must pay 10 000 EUR in advance and you must wait 2 months that I can come there.<br />2)If you have any problem with any kind of enemy who disturb your life, you can hire me. For example, many criminals will refuse to kill a cop, prosecutor, judge, etc, because they don&#039;t want to come under pressure of police and newspapers. I am not part of organized criminality and I can do any job.<br />3)Target must be older than 16.<br />4)You must give me in advance next information about target: picture, name, approximately age, home and working address, what car he/she uses and what is registration of the car. If you know how many members of family are in house, it would be good to know, but it is not condition.<br />5)Prices are different, depending who is target. For every price you should add 5 000 EUR for preparing of action in EU or 10 000 if I must go outside of EU. You must send me money 2 times, first time 5 000 EUR, when I buy weapon (you get picture of gun and city) and everything what I need for action, you must pay the rest of money, after that I finish the job. You need somebody to be eliminated, I don&#039;t need it, so, you must take a risk about money, everything is anonymous, so...I don&#039;t want to eliminate for half price.<br />- To eliminate some ordinary person, my price is 20 000 EUR.<br />- To eliminate criminal or cop, my price is 50 000 EUR. If he is bog boss or higher ranking cop, price is 100 000 EUR.<br />- To eliminate paparazzo, my price is 50 000 EUR and for journalist 100 000 EUR.<br />- To eliminate a businessman, price range from 50 000 to 200 000 EUR.<br />- To eliminate your rich wife/husband, price depend from wealth of that person.<br />6)You can contact me only through Tor PM or my email, if you try to get any information about me, I will not answer to you anymore. You must use encryption, PGP/GPG, you can find detailed instruction below.<br /><br /><br />~ Pay and enjoy ~

That&#039;s a joke because I wouldn&#039;t piss on that ass-bandit even if he was on fire. <br /><br />Congrats to all that made the Dank-hate-list, it means you are a good person and that you are living your life in a good and productive way. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25899.60 &lt;&lt;&lt; My response to his other thread, don&#039;t think I missed anything.....

				Tbh I think Dank&#039;s troll/cops thread should be left open. Locking it is just giving him what he wants and more ammunition to sustain his fantasies

I didn&#039;t actually speak to you before you said that our Dank had a bad attitude and I said that nobody would remove your post because you were just making a fair observation. <br /><br />What makes me laugh is that Dank only has beef with me because when I got here I said he was a bit paranoid and needed to put down the crack..... From such small flirtations blossom such great romances! ;)
