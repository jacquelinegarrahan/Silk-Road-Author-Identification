				So yeah how often do you take drugs and what drugs?<br />for me its -<br />Alcohol pretty much every weekend<br />Cannabis usually around 3/4 times a week<br />Tabacco - only when im drunk, in a joint or rollin<br />MDMA - I&#039;ve only done it 4 times but i&#039;ve spaced it out over a year and intend to keep it this way<br />Mephedrone, Cocaine - 1 times everry month or so<br /><br />There would be hallucinogenics on this list too but i&#039;m not sure i&#039;m mentally ready to take them yet, but sometime soon fo&#039;sure. :P<br /><br />

				A better question would be: How often don&#039;t you do drugs.<br /><br />And the answer would be: I try to take a day off to be sober, at least once a week.<br /><br />I fuck mostly with Acid, about a tab a day.<br /><br />Cigarettes are disgusting me by the day and I really want to quit but am too weak willed to&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Marijuana about once a month.

				Well as for my daily drug use I like smoke a few bowls of bud throughout the day from when I wake up until I go to sleep. Occasionally I like to start my day with a quick snort of MXE but typically I wait until around 6pm to really break out the MXE. Depending on my schedule, I enjoy taking the time to meditate with a small bit of DMT because this let&#039;s me know how the rest of my day will go. Oh, and of course I have caffeine and alcohol like everyone else. ;) Looking at the rest of the week though it&#039;s nice to alternate between LSD, MDMA, 25i-NBOMe, and 2C-E on&nbsp; a weekly basis to keep things fresh and let my brain rest. :D<br /><br />I used to smoke cigarettes and cigars pretty heavily during my last career, and took amphetamines even more heavily before that, but luckily I kicked those habits which gave me the motivation to begin following my dream and am much happier for it.

				I vape bubble hash and wax all day everyday (usually leave the wax for sleepy time)&nbsp; Used to trip on lucy almost every other weekend, we went really hard for a while, now its been about 6-7 months since i tripped on any type of lucy.&nbsp; DMT goes down at least once a month if anything 2-4 times haha. (jungle spice) Alcohol and Tobacco - Rarely drink, occasionally. Don&#039;t smoke cigs it disgusts me!&nbsp; Done lots of mdma/ mda in my time haven&#039;t had any in a good year or so. Lost the magic waiting for it to return ;)&nbsp; No coke, no Heroin, no pcp, no bullshit!&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;KEEP ON THE GRASS&quot;

				How often I do drugs is an okay question, but the answer is boring as of this moment, as I just smoke two to five bowls over the course of every day. Not expecting anything else in the near future, though sometimes my friends like to surprise me.<br /><br />(&quot;Hey dude, we&#039;re measuring out capsules of Molly, and we need you to test dosage. Here&#039;s one and some weed and hash, that should be way more than you need to smoke tonight but I figured you&#039;d appreciate that. Let us know how it is, and we&#039;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;)<br />(&quot;I have a headache, I think I&#039;m gonna head home and try to sleep it off.&quot;<br />&quot;You know what&#039;s good for headaches? Acid. You want some?&quot;<br />&quot;Okay, you know my weakness.&quot;) &lt;- Took some 6 or 10 hits over that night... every time he said it was time to redose, I felt like we hadn&#039;t done it yet, had kept getting distracted, even though I knew better.<br /><br />Now, a much better question would be how often I would do drugs if my situation allowed.<br /><br />I&#039;d smoke the same, 2-5 bowls over every day. I&#039;d partake of one hallucinogen or another (mostly acid) every Friday night. Every Saturday morning I&#039;d enjoy some Salvia, and every Saturday night before bed I&#039;d enjoy a small token of DMT, though every two to four weeks I&#039;d enjoy a breakthrough. Less often I might augment one experience or several with a low dose of acid, or 120 mg of MDMA, or (more rarely) a bit of ketamine, for the pleasant sensation of resetting to zero and relearning everything from how to crawl up.<br />And I&#039;d occasionally spend a week or more with a persistent low-to-mid level acid high.

				Alcohol daily and speed in the weekends, sometimes during the week but I try to minimize that. Don&#039;t smoke cigarettes, never liked them... disgusting taste, bleh! <br />Every now and then some coke and even rarer I take some X. <br /><br />Pretty boring actually, especially when reading the stories above me :P<br /><br />Oh and how could I forget about psychedelics, that&#039;s fairly irregular I&#039;d say once per 2 months or so :)

				I do a line of K once I wake up and then a few more during the rest of the day, but that&#039;s the only drug I do daily. I do MXE almost every night . I do some form of psychedelic a few times a month. That&#039;s about it.

				Smoke 2-3 grams of weed a day, that is a constant. Drink and have psychedelics every weekend and maybe one other day. Roll every 2-3 weeks. And if I have a dissociative, every other day.

				And I&#039;m sorry you feel that way, but this is how I look at acid: Basically, it&#039;s a performance enhancer. It improves your senses, spatial, and conversational abilities. Over a large period of time, your brain adapts to habits and patterns. My theory conveys that with enough consecutive days of acid, I&#039;ll have the habits I want to adapt in my lifestyle. It is certainly not a waste. Even at 500/sheet (Which is the MOST I&#039;ve paid for acid), I spend about 5 dollars a day. Compare that a good Starbucks brew- It comes out to about the same with less effects and a residual crash. Coffee just a temporary enhancer and I&#039;m still paying more for it. <br /><br />Acid however, has a way of embedding certain ideas and thoughts within the mental realm. And with my current results: So far so good&nbsp; 8)

				Alcohol: on average once every other weekend, some weeks/months I&quot;ll drink a few days a week, and other times I&#039;ll abstain for a month or two.&nbsp; I like drinking, but I&#039;m a very sensible drinking for a college student, and I usually just like to a sustain a buzz for the night rather than drink until I puke or blackout.<br />Weed: at my peak I smoked 3-5 times a week, but I usually only smoke when offered every now and then on weekends.&nbsp; I use it most at college when I don&#039;t have any upcoming big assignments or exams.<br />DXM: Abused it a lot for a month back in high school, haven&#039;t touched it since.<br />2C-E: Only dosed it once, sold away my other 500mg.<br />DOI: Only dosed it thrice<br />Heroin: Had a gram once, snorted a few times a week.<br />(oxy|hydro)codone: Only a few times a year mostly due to lack of access to it, but recently I&#039;ve been using a few times a month.<br />Benzos (mostly Valium and K-pins): I usually only use them when I get insomnia or when I want to sleep for a very long time.&nbsp; Used them probably 20-30 times in the last 2 years.<br />Amphetamines: only small amounts when I had difficult and time-consuming vector calculus or organic chemistry work to do.<br />MDPV: Used it almost daily for about 2 months, but I haven&#039;t touched it despite having a lot of it in the last year or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />Every now and then I worry that I use more than I should, but I never do drugs between Sunday night through Friday afternoon anymore due to work.
