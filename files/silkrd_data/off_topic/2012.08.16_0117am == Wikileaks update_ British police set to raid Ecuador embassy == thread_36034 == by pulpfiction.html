				Thought some may find this interesting. And/or upsetting.<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/opinion/political-news/uk-police-descend-on-assanges-embassy-refuge-20120816-249pe.html<br /><br />BREAKING NEWS: Police are massing outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Australian WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is holed up after seeking political asylum.<br />WikiLeaks tweeted this morning that police in two large vans had arrived ‘‘to surround the Ecuadorian embassy in London’’ about midnight, local time.<br />Fairfax Media correspondent Karen Kissane reports from outside the embassy that a police custody van is parked 20 metres from the front door and three Metropolitan Police tactical support group members, normally assigned to public order duties, are at the entrance to the building.<br />Kissane says WikiLeaks supporters gathered there say five police have entered the building housing the embassy. However, it is unclear if they have entered the embassy itself.<br />Advertisement&nbsp; <br />One person stationed outside the embassy, identifying himself as a &quot;citizen journalist&quot; with the twitter account https://twitter.com/alburyj was streaming the activity, but the feed has since stopped. .<br />A crowd is building in the west London street outside the embassy.<br />Assange supporters are using social media to urge people to gather at the location. &quot;Ecuadorian embassy&quot; is trending worldwide on Twitter.<br />Occupy Wall Street tweeted shortly after the raid: &quot;ANNOUNCEMENT: #Assange supporters are calling for an occupation at #Ecuador&#039;s Embassy in #London RIGHT NOW<br />A pizza delivery man arrived at the embassy door as police stood outside. However the driver, who later identified himself on the livestream as Georgie, left soon after without delivering the pizza.<br />Earlier, the UK issued a &quot;threat&quot; to enter the embassy to arrest Assange, who has been taking refuge inside since June.<br />The news comes as Ecuador prepares to announce within hours if it will grant political asylum to the WikiLeaks founder, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said .<br />The British government has told Ecuadorian authorities it believes it can enter its embassy in London and arrest&nbsp; Assange.<br />But any incursion by the Brits at the embassy would be ‘‘without modern precedent’’ and could end up before the international courts, according to an Australian law expert.<br />Professor Donald Rothwell, from Australlian National University College of Law, said the government&#039;s stance shows just how serious the UK is about extraditing the WikiLeaks founder to Sweden.<br />&quot;The Ecuadorian Embassy enjoys protection under Article 22 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which precludes the United Kingdom authorities from entering the Embassy without consent. Assange has enjoyed the protection of the embassy since he sought asylum there on 19 June 2012.<br /><br />&quot;If the United Kingdom revoked the Embassy’s diplomatic protection and entered the Embassy to arrest Assange, Ecuador could rightly view this as a significant violation of international law which may find its way before an international court.”<br />In Australia, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says the Commonwealth has little power to intervene.<br />Assange is wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden, but says he fears deportation to the United States, which may seek to convict him for his website&#039;s release of a trove of secret documents.<br />Patino told a news conference that Ecuador received a written threat on Wednesday from Britain that &quot;it could assault our embassy&quot; if Assange was not handed over.<br />He said the threat was delivered to Ecuador&#039;s foreign ministry and ambassador in London.<br />Ecuador has said it hopes to announce a decision this week on Assange&#039;s asylum request.<br />Ms Roxon said the government had yet to receive any formal advice on Assange&#039;s asylum application to Ecuador. She said she had learned of the latest updates through the media.<br />Despite call for government intervention into Assange&#039;s predicament, Ms Roxon insists the matter is an issue between Assange and Ecuador, &#039;&#039;and increasingly it seems it is a matter between Ecuador and the United Kingdom&#039;&#039;.<br />The level of public expectation that the government must intervene in the Assange case was far greater than the actual powers available to the Commonwealth, Ms Roxon said.<br />&#039;&#039;Our role in this is only a diplomatic one, a consular one to make sure Mr Assange has support that he needs for consular issues. It&#039;s not something where we have any legal role where we can play.&#039;&#039;<br />The Australian has been holed up in the embassy since June 19, taking refuge to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces questioning for alleged sexual misconduct.<br />Assange&#039;s supporters say the charges are trumped up and believe the US has secretly indicted him and would extradite him from Sweden.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There is also a man tweeting live from outside the embassy:<br /><br />https://twitter.com/alburyj (clearweb obviously)<br /><br />

				You&#039;ve got to be fucking kidding me. If this is true it breaks the most basic law of diplomacy there is. An embassy is sovereign territory, literally a part of the country Ecuador itself from a legal perspective.<br /><br />There is no way the British will/would get away with that. I mean, they could do it, but the repercussions would be immense. The blowback is going to be something unreal.<br /><br />

				If we forced China to become opium addicts at gun point, we can snatch Julian Cunt-Chops from an embassy lol. <br /><br />(not saying I agree with this by the way, quite the reverse, I just think Julian Assange can be very easily compared to a baked potato with a shit in it)

				This is so stupid. Even if he is guilty of sexual assault against some broad there is no way any government on Earth would go this far just to get their hands on him. It&#039;s just a ploy. For all we know there was no &quot;victim&quot; or she could even be lying. And even if it was proved that she was lying it wouldn&#039;t matter at that point because he&#039;d already be in Sweden where the USA can extradite him and charge him with god knows what.<br /><br />Whatever you think about the guy I still think it&#039;s really a disappointment that more countries aren&#039;t vouching for him.At the very least I hope people are monitoring the shit out of this situation to make sure he&#039;s not sent back to the USA.

Which could lead Ecuador to expel Western diplomats and team with Venezuela. If the South American cartels chose to unite and flex their muscle to retaliate, oil prices could go through a second jump. All because Britain chooses to violate international ethics. Sure they can theoretically pass a quick law stripping Ecuador of diplomatic territory, but that doesn&#039;t make it right.<br /><br />http://www.ustream.tv/channel/occupynewsnetwork<br /><br />This clearnet site is streaming the whole thing and he is doing a great job covering it.

				I&#039;m assuming there&#039;s huge US pressure behind this as the UK government has no real interest in Julian Assange&#039;s extradition to Sweden, apart from getting a pat on the head from the US, and the opportunity to make it look like they&#039;re not afraid to crack down on freedom of speech and dissent China-style.

The US and UK have shacked up as war-buddies, and both make much of their close &#039;ally&#039; status. As the UK has no real interest in Assange&#039;s extradition, except to see him tried in the US for releasing diplomatic cables and such, there HAS to be pressure from the US on this. There&#039;s no way they&#039;d violate Ecuadorian sovereignty in order to arrest someone for extradition to Sweden for questioning on an alleged crime. Questioning. On an alleged crime. They wouldn&#039;t break diplomatic protocol and international law for a &#039;maybe&#039;, and certainly not for the type of crime he&#039;s accused of.<br /><br />Once he&#039;s on Ecuadorian soil, which he landed on the second he set foot inside their embassy, he is no longer the UK&#039;s problem, hence the UK should have no interest in him unless and until Ecuador refuse his request for political asylum and he is released to UK authorities.<br />The government is now so brazen, and so mad with power, that they don&#039;t even care that people can see this. It&#039;s madness.

				I&#039;m just thinking aloud here. But if the UK does storm the embassy wouldn&#039;t that be an act of war? I thought embassies were treated like foreign soil. And I thought if Assange was granted asylum it would be as if he had diplomatic protection. ;D

				Yeah, you&#039;re right about that whothefuckisthis, I&#039;d say that the embassy will not be stormed, but a lot of pressure will be put on Ecuador and Ecuador will end up selling Assange out to the USA/GB for something they want, unless politicians aren&#039;t scumbags in Ecuador that is, what do you guys think?<br /><br />edit:&nbsp; Also, to pine, I think you meant precedent not prescient, not sure.

				Where asylum gets tricky is that an embassy can grant it to someone, however getting that someone out of the embassy and the country is a whole different story.&nbsp; The soil might be sovereign but the airspace out of it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; There are many cases of people granted asylum who have had to live in the embassy for a long time until the diplomatic angles can be worked out between the two countries.

				Fresh from the press - Ecuador have granted Assange&#039;s claim for Asylum, aided in no small measure by posturing from our government (technically your government as I&#039;m Manx ;-) ) Of course this is academic if he cannot find a viable way to leave the Embassy. <br /><br />Could he apply for Ecuadorean Citizenship or indeed citzenship of a country which does not have an agreed extradition treaty with the UK? Or would it not apply retrospectively? It&#039;s at times like this I regret splitting up with that lawyer...<br /><br />V.

				I&#039;ve no idea why you&#039;ve so much vitriol aimed at J.A Limetless.<br /><br />Being annoying or seeming to be arrogant is not a crime, just a minor character flaw. In comparison to the state arrogance of extracting citizens from all over the planet just because you feel like it e.g. Kim Dotcom or far worse the extraordinary rendition process, it comes in at a very, very distant second.<br /><br />The Americans are becoming more fascist by the hour. There are concentration camps all over her heartland, secret prisons and not-so-secret prisons like Guantanamo Bay. That&#039;s before we start talking about the regular prison population, most of whom shouldn&#039;t even be behind bars for anything like the sentences they&#039;ve been given. You have dudes in prison for decades for smuggling marijuana or MDMA and murderers walking out in five. <br /><br />It does not matter whether you&#039;re right wing or left wing, this is fucking insane. When somebody like Pat Robertson thinks you&#039;re bonkers, you&#039;ve got a fairly serious problem and that&#039;s putting it mildly.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe Americans citizens have the gall to point at China&#039;s record on human rights. It is not great, but it&#039;s like the pot calling the kettle black. Just how many foreign wars have China been involved in directly or indirectly over the past 4 decades? Then look at the Americans. Free Tibet? Are you fucking kidding me? Try freeing America if you&#039;re a real patriot.<br /><br />/rant<br /><br />
