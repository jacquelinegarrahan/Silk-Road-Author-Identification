				I&#039;ve been in fights with knaves and knuckelheads on my local streets many a time. I am almost famous here for it. I have&nbsp; hassled gangbangers and negroes in their cars with loud subwoofers, done citizen&#039;s arrest on one, and chased one through the park when he came in a restaurant and threatened me at a table. I could tell you more. I am practically fearless. Comes with no-fap, something older peoples used to know. No-fap also made my voice deeper and my beard coarser. Save the male essence; you become more male. Wankers and sex addicts didn&#039;t win WWII, and don&#039;t win any war.

				Just yesterday, for instance, I was in an open conflict with a local leatherclad Hell&#039;s Angel biker. He started his friggin noisy Harley and revved it just as I was walking by. He was also right next to some people sitting at an outdoor table, and I try to do my part to protect the quality of life of my fellow man. This guy was also parked illegally. I have confronted these morons many times. I ostentatiously plugged one ear using just my middle finger (a favorite gesture I make to bikers), my head turned slightly toward him to get his attention. When I got to him I called &quot;Fucking Moron!&quot; right at him over his egregious and unnecessary noise. <br /><br />I heard him turn off the Harley then he walks in and up to me where I was standing in line. <br /><br />He demanded, &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br /><br />I said, &quot;You hurt my ears. You have no right to hurt anybody&#039;s ears. This is the public realm,&quot; etc. <br /><br />He got really abusive and foul mouthed, making a big scene with me, slapping his leather chest like an Italian (as in, &quot;c&#039;mon, hit me.&quot;) He was all decked out in black leather, boots, and is palsy with many of the people in the shop who think he&#039;s cool. He was extremely agitated and saying very hostile things, and the manager started to yell at the two of us. He wanted me to go outside. I just called him a moron again and explained that he had no right to damage the public realm or to hurt my or anybody&#039;s ears. The owner of the shop kept yelling &quot;take it outside guys&quot; and he turned and left. Turned out he was a Hollywood stunt man, has been in some big movies (&quot;Kill Bill,&quot; and others), and thinks he&#039;s a big deal.<br /><br />This was yesterday morning at around 11 a.m.

				Mate lemme tell ya that I once was a professional wholesale ass-beater and face-kicker! I bench-pressed cars onto people and did things that physics says isn&#039;t even possible! I would fight three people while eating my extra-rare steak on a sandwich of onions and habanero peppers!<br /><br />Then there was this woman. <br /><br />She tricked me! I thought she wanted to spar so I chugged a fifth of whiskey (like I do before every fight). <br /><br />She wanted to spar at my place. I thought it was weird but I went along with it. Well, one thing led to another and...<br />she didn&#039;t want to fight. She wanted to...FUCK! <br /><br />Obviously I tried to hold her off but by the time I realized we weren&#039;t going to practice our nude-judo it was too late: we were fornicating like fornicators. <br /><br />I won&#039;t go into details but needless to say after she...had her way with me...my fighting powers were gone. I could barely kick one ass and I was no longer handing out discounts for multiple asses to kick. <br /><br />This is a painful story for me. I guess I&#039;m just too drunk right now to be sharing this. Now, I admit it, I don&#039;t really fight anymore. <br /><br /><br />All because of one woman. Be warned -- I grow a beard like a masculine woman and I lost my James Earl Jones voice and now I sound more like...no I can&#039;t go on.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let these mistakes happen to you guys, my brothers.

				I&#039;ve been in kind-of fights during ice hockey games, but never gloves down, punches in the face because we wore full metal cages and nobody wanted a broken hand. I guess it&#039;s the closest I&#039;ve been to being in a fight. I also never threw a punch, but have had numerous punches thrown at me on the ice.<br /><br />Off the ice, I&#039;ve been in sparring matches with friends with boxing gloves and headgear. I&#039;ve never been in a real fight though. I&#039;d also probably be beaten to a pulp because I wear glasses and if I lose those I&#039;m pretty much blind. I&#039;d like to know how to fight and just hope I never have to use it.

Maybe the reason you get into so many fights is because you yell idiotic shit at people you don&#039;t know. What did you honestly expect the outcome to be when you yell fucking moron at a supposed Hell&#039;s Angel? You&#039;re going to say the wrong thing to the wrong person one day and end up getting shot. One thing I&#039;ve learned a long time ago, don&#039;t talk shit to people you don&#039;t know.

				I don&#039;t &#039;fight&#039;, but I treat every confrontation as a self-defense situation in which my life could be in danger if I don&#039;t act aggressively and then flee.<br /><br />I am friendly as fuck, can take a joke and give a joke, I never start shit with anyone but if someone is getting hostile I immediately search for a weapon I can use to incapacitate them and quickly make my escape, no matter the situation. I always have something on hand and in my car that can be improvised for self-defense if someone pulls out a knife or attacks me.<br /><br />Idiots who like fighting end up getting killed when they get knocked to the ground and get their head stomped in. A guy I know thought he was a tough guy and loved starting fights with everyone who crossed him. One day he started someone in the street and punched the guy a few times.. the guy got up, walked to his car and pulled out a samurai sword, and ran at the guy I knew, sliced him so bad in the shoulder he lost his arm.<br /><br />The last fight I was in was with someone who came up to me in a tunnel and asked me for money. I told him &#039;No&#039; firmly and he got up in my face aggressively demanding money and I knew I had a few split-seconds to act before he possibly pulled a weapon. I stabbed him as hard as I could in the eye with a sharpened key I have on my key chain and he went down clutching his face, so I legged it like an Olympic sprinter and didn&#039;t look back.<br /><br />I have friends who are very aggressive people and love confrontation, but that&#039;s not my style, I think that shit is stupid and just draws attention to you. When you are selling drugs, you don&#039;t want attention, you don&#039;t want to stand out, you don&#039;t want to look like a tough guy. I&#039;m friendly to everyone I meet and people are friendly to me because I show them love. if I don&#039;t like someone I won&#039;t start shit with them, I&#039;ll just cut them straight out of my life and have nothing to do with them whatsoever, that&#039;s the smart way to do it.

				It&#039;s these clowns who go to Karate and that palaver, they just haven&#039;t got the heart or soul for a fight. The best and most realistic form of fighting is without doubt MMA...which to the uninitiated is Mixed Martial Arts..there is simply no other form of training so realistic, as its wrestling grappling strength&nbsp; work and tactics...go one some one say no its boxing...

OK, so you&#039;re a 30 odd something drug user, I suppose this was all in your &quot; Heyday&quot; ? You haven&#039;t trained for years and you&#039;ve forgotten more than most people know. Am I right? You seem to have small penis &#039;s on your mind, don&#039;t tell me, you have Freudian small penis syndrome. Of course it all makes sense, claiming to of done the impossible or at best implausible, whilst you&#039;re so so insecure. You need help desperately.<br />

				Violence should not be encouraged or called out as a good thing.&nbsp; It is sometimes, saddly, necessary, but should be avoided.&nbsp; Our hands are at their best when used to create, not destroy.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, knowing that one must be ready, I&#039;ve made a detailed study and practice of the various martial arts, and have had to emply my knowledge more than once (two times to be specific with mixed results...sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes the bear eats you).&nbsp; Most of my training went out the window in a surge of fear, anger and stupidity.&nbsp; I was lucky to walk away from these events.&nbsp; I&#039;d encourage the study of the Martial Arts, it is hard to become good, and builds confidence and humility, and can prepare you to survive a violent encounter.<br /><br />However, let me provide a cautionary tale to all you wood-be tough-guys.<br /><br />I knew a young guy, very tough, very macho.&nbsp; Was at a bar one night, got drunk.&nbsp; A fight started...who started it?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; He fought, landed a good punch...the guy went down.&nbsp; All the way down, that guy died (it happens).&nbsp; This young man then spent the next few decades behind bars.&nbsp; What a waste, all round.&nbsp; <br /><br />There may be a time when you must fight, but if you&#039;re smart and fortunate those times will be few and far between (or never).&nbsp; <br /><br />Violence, hate, anger.&nbsp; These things are toxic to humans, avoid them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Love, compassion, kindness, these things heal you and will give you strength, embrace them.<br /><br />R.&nbsp;

				I think that for you to be a man you need to have been in at least one serious fight.<br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t promote or encourage violence but how do you know what kind of wood you are made of if you&#039;ve never been in a fight.

I thought she wanted to spar so I chugged a fifth of whiskey (like I do before every fight). <br /><br />She wanted to spar at my place. I thought it was weird but I went along with it.

I could barely kick one ass and I was no longer handing out discounts for multiple asses to kick. <br /><br />This is a painful story for me. I guess I&#039;m just too drunk right now to be sharing this. Now, I admit it, I don&#039;t really fight anymore. <br /><br /><br />All because of one woman.
