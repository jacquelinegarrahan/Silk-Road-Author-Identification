				I accidently posted this in &quot;drug safety&quot; first, but this party started @ midnight UTC for me.<br /><br />Some of you might now why, others don&#039;t, but I say July 6th should be marked on the darknet calender as a day of celebrating life, love, and friendship.<br /><br />Maybe the story of what happened this day will surface publicly some day, it is both sad and glorious, but definitely significant!<br /><br />go bust out your drug of choice today and celebrate, focus on love and friendship, and I&#039;m sure that it will be felt throughout the world this day!<br /><br />We&#039;re all going to miss you buddy<br /><br />wretched<br />

				Happy party to you friend, for me i will be at a music festival tomorrow. I will be with a girl i recently met and i don&#039;t want to be on drugs (to be honnest i have done a lot in my vacation last week) because i don&#039;t know is opinion on the subject. I have some triforce E pill on the way.. if by miracle they arrives tomorrow i don&#039;t know if i will resist to the temptation of popping a colored pill&nbsp; :o if i can get her real drunk on alcohol maybe it may works.. maybe just alcohol will do it after all ? Anyway do all the drug you can for me !!

				I most certainly will be celebrating today. I&#039;m not entirely sure why you think a celebration is deserved, but I will most certainly honor it, and I will focus on love and friendship today while I take shrooms and related substances.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be sending good vibes.

				I don&#039;t really know the reason why this day, but coincidentally a couple of friends are driving down to chill n do drugs, so we will celebrate love and friendship. Sending the good vibes, and heck, i&#039;ll make sure to send em every year.<br /><br />But yeah if you are willing to post about the reasons to appease our curiosity, that&#039;d be cool.
