				You can do a DoS attack with a simple program called LOIC (low orbit ion cannon, name is from some game). However that does give away your IP address and it&#039;s only effective if you do it with a big group of people.<br /><br />If you want to do an effective DDoS attack on your own, you need to hack a lot of computers and make part of your botnet. Then you instruct them all to do a DoS attack.<br /><br />I guess if you pay a group of hackers, they are willing to do it for you. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if that will stop spam though.

				there are a lot of botnets and a lot of russians in need of fast cash it is very cheap to pay for a DDOS for a week. But it would be pointless, for the effort to find and start one a programmer could fix the loophole that allows mass duplicate posting.
