				Christians believe that after they die they will go to heaven and live in bliss for all of eternity. Many of them believe that if they kill themselves they will not go to heaven but rather will burn in hell. If atheists start killing christians they will in the view of christians be sending them on a first class trip to eternal bliss. The atheists will also end up killing some christians who otherwise would have gone on to commit suicide, thus saving them from eternal damnation in hell. Plus after all the Christians are dead the world will be a much freer and happier place and scientific progress will move forward at an extremely fast rate. It will improve the quality of life on earth for us, and the christians will all be chilling in eternal paradise so who are they to complain? The same thing should also probably be done for Muslims and Jews. If any Christians Muslims or Jews disagree with this I guess it just goes to show they lack faith. Anyway who are they to know Gods plan (maybe he plans for us to kill all of them).<br /><br />Thoughts?

				for most christians, it just turns out they are gullible people.&nbsp; Thats why they believe the lie of god to begin with. Thats also why most of them are republicans. Its because they can be easily lied to.&nbsp;

				God and religion were created by man to explain questions that he couldn&#039;t answer. Such as... why am I here? how did I even get here? and most importantly, where am I going?

I honestly have no problems with christians. And I am actually making fun of christian logic. If they really think they will go to eternal bliss after they die, but not if they kill themselves, they should be crossing their fingers that somebody kills them already. Plus even though a small minority of christians are not totally insane control freaks who want everyone who doesn&#039;t think exactly as they do to repent or burn in hell, enough of them are fucking insane enough and bad enough for humanity that I really am not sure I would miss them as a whole (actually I certainly wouldn&#039;t, although I certainly would miss individuals).

It&#039;s difficult to comprehend this concept at first, but when you look at the nature of the scientific method you realize there is no way to collect information on what happens after death (because noone has been able to come back and tell what happens) and thus it is impossible to come to any substantial conclusion on this matter. It for this reason that athiesm is a FAITH, because it is the belief in something without any evidence.<br /><br />This is where the philosophical &quot;demarcation problem&quot; comes in.

This is the problem of &quot;presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past.&quot; We cannot assume that all swans are white because on every OBSERVABLE occasion they were white. This is an easy analogy to picture, but how about the laws of physics?

I find all this knowledge to be weighing me down rather than liberating. In every experience I DO think about how everything is finite and fleeting and it makes me think &quot;what&#039;s the point?&quot; The best of Keats&#039; poetry is almost exclusively about the nature of immortality, and in &quot;Ode to a Grecian Urn&quot; he makes the argument that its better to be frozen in a state of eternal anticipation (such as the lovers depicted on the urn) than for them to reach their climax, for once they reach that peak their love and energy and passion can only diminish. I almost don&#039;t want to experience anything anymore because the pain of not being able to have something again (for example, a girl that was truly amazing) is a million times worse than not having it in the first place.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9355.msg86791#msg86791">Quote from: abuttelmao on January 22, 2012, 06:50 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I would also add that community, and social acceptance, is a primary motivator behind people choosing to be religious.&nbsp; Like it or not, there is still a social stigma attached to being an atheist.&nbsp; The communal aspects of religion, however, are in my opinion one of its most positive and fruitful aspects.&nbsp; Religion provides a way for people to be involved in something greater than themselves, and gives them a way to get rid of some of the loneliness and alienation that is all too common in our modern society.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Golden words drip from your lips (or fingers, whichever) my friend.

However I think science can prove that some faiths are incorrect, because many of them make claims that are scientifically provable as false. Of course you could argue that an all powerful God could make things appear to be different to science than they actually are in reality, but at that point you can also say God can make 1 + 1 look like it = 3 when it really = 2, so at some point you really need to either draw a line or accept everything and nothing as true simultaneously (and if you do this you are pretty much saying you know nothing, which means you take knowing nothing as being true, which means you know something)

Miracles have not been conclusively dis-proven. Rather, the religious &quot;theory&quot; of miracles is neither proven, provable nor even testable and so fails epically as a scientific theory. In the case of people making fantastical claims the onus is on them to provide proof for their theory not for everyone else to make their theory rigorous enough to disprove it.<br />

				Kill The Christian!! <br />Anyway, if that happened, then Christians wouldn&#039;t have to worry about any Atheists &quot;accidentally&quot; getting into Heaven and ruining it for them! <br />Oh, Religion &amp; Politics, the true downfall of humankind. I loathe you with all my being. <br />@KMF: I think religions have already begun changing, and there will most likely be a New New Testament very soon. I know for a fact that Catholicism is opening its eyes to Science. <br />I was raised in 2 EXTREMELY religious families, from 2 extreme religions. One is still considered a Cult. Although, they all are. I know more of the Bible than most Theologians....most, mind you. I like reading some of the stories out loud while my Christian friends are tripping ;) *especially* from the OT! They hate all the blood, violence, sex, slavery, so they made a New Testament, lolz. Now, with Science being accepted, they will have to make a NNT, to finally accept the existence of dinosaurs as being more then 6,000 years old!
