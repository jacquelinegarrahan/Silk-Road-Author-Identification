				Hi guys, I joined the gym yesterday, I&#039;m going with 3 friends, one of them thinks he knows what he&#039;s doing but I don&#039;t think so.<br /><br />Basically, I didn&#039;t exercise at all for more than 4 years now. I&#039;m not fat I&#039;m actually skinny, not anorexic but no muscles either. I&#039;m around average height and slightly underweight for my size, but not dangerously underweight and its not due to any health problems, just lack of exercise.<br />I was wondering if anyone was in my position and what programme they followed. I could afford a personal trainer (extremely expensive in London) but I would rather spend my money in a different way, I don&#039;t have that much.<br /><br />There must be someone that can guide me on this forum. Any advice would be helpful I don&#039;t wanna go gym like a fucktard to do random stuff without achieving anything. It seems this is what my friends have been doing for the past month or so. <br />

				Diet and proper technique.<br /><br />Don&#039;t waste your money on any pre-workout supplements and for fuck sake don&#039;t use any AAS (Steroids) until you are 1 year consistent and with proper form. They&#039;re only dangerous if you treat them with disrespect. <br /><br />If you want to get big you gotta lift big fucking weights (Good form!). Don&#039;t be a pussy and do &quot;toning&quot; &quot;high rep&quot; shit. Compound and Olympic-style lifts that incorporate as much muscle fiber per movement will force your body to get big and they act as a synergy to your smaller muscles. Biceps are 1/16th the size of your back muscles but will develop tremendously during your pullups and bent over rows. Anyone that does a curl is just a jersey shore douche bag. Get in that gym, do your work and GTFO. <br /><br />*Heavy Squats (Monday)<br />Bench Press (Monday)<br />Weighted Dips (Monday)<br />Push Press (Wed)<br />Power Cleans/Snatch (Wed)<br />Heavy Shrugs (Wed)<br />Weighted Pullups (Fri)<br />*Deadlifts (Fri)<br />Heavy Rows (Fri)<br /><br />*I like to alternate Week 1 (Heavy Squat) / (5 x 5 Deadlift) then Week 2 (5 x 5 Squat) / (Heavy Deadlift)<br /><br />That&#039;s it. If you see someone doing cable kickbacks laugh in their fucking face while you pick up 225lbs of solid metal above your head grunting like an oversexed ogre. If you are interested in functional strength training and tone though you should check out a Kettlebell and cross-fit routine. <br /><br />Eat 5 (500cal) small meals a day consisting of a lot of egg whites, chicken, fish, turkey, pork, lean steaks, vegetables, nuts -- On your workout days slam a caffeine pill and eat an apple/orange 30 minutes before you hit the gym. You can also add in some good carbohydrates on your workout days like Oats, Brown Rice and Sweet Potatoes. <br /><br />Stay away from the machines<br />Work up SLOWLY with perfect fucking form on all your free weight lifts -- If you have to bench press 2 cheese wheels before your feet stop flailing off the ground and your shoulder blades can stay planted then do it. You&#039;re going to look like a pussy for awhile and that is something that will humble and help you progress but just STICK WITH IT.<br /><br />It take 10 weeks for the average human to develop a good habit. Keeping your body in shape and strong as potentially possible could save your life and it will make you feel tremendously better health and confidence wise.<br /><br />

But there is some good information if you are a smart consumer. <br /><br />*Broscience (broh-sy-unts) def: Broscience is the predominant brand of reasoning in bodybuilding circles where the anecdotal reports of jacked dudes are considered more credible than scientific research. <br /><br />Broscientist can usually be identified: Very &quot;jakked&quot; male sporting an Affliction T-shirt, covered with skulls, that is one size too small. Dawns a backward, flat bill, hat with the edge coming either in contact or 1cm above eyebrow line, sounds of Nickleback on repeat coming from Sansa-Clip headphones. If eye-contact is made, expect a single upwards head nod followed by a &quot;sup&quot;. To decrease your chance at meeting Broscientist in the field; stay close to Squat rack. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47240.msg498750#msg498750">Quote from: StExo on October 02, 2012, 09:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As barb said though, proper technique is absolute key to any workout because you can do 4 hours straight in a gym, but it&#039;ll get you virtually nowhere without the correct technique and it&#039;d be far more beneficial to do regular exercise across the week than 1 hardcore day of exercise as the body needs time to recover. Proper diet cannot be substituted, recently the Dietics association (Nutrition doctors) said supplements have been known to cause serious health problems, especially kidney and liver failure as early as a persons 30th birthday and can cause other effects which last for the rest of your life. Avoid anything unnatural in my opinion, consume food as it should be consumed and if you need to take supplements, you&#039;re doing the exact thing which has caused the obesity epidemic, taking shortcuts and cutting corners ;) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Curious about the supplements here. Are you referring to pre-workout powder/pills and prohormones? Because I take a Multivitamin, Fish/Flax Oil, BCAA&#039;s, Creatine and Protein powder

				Start off easy. Guts in the gym will see you are new or out of shape and will ease you in.<br /><br />As for supplements, this is not needed unless you are addicted to gyms or are aiming for a certain phsique.<br /><br />Avoid steroids and other meds. <br /><br />We never do coke or any stimulant in the gym, this can be dangerous.<br /><br />Smoking a joint after exercise is good.<br /><br />The best part is that you flush out all toxins from drugs and rebalance the seratonin levels naturally.<br /><br />Look at a few gyms and there are good membership deals out there. My gym is open all hours and has showers. We pay 200 UK pounds per year but have been members for a long timne so get a cheaper rate.<br /><br />We also have home gyms which are cheap when bought second hand off Ebay and even Amazon.<br /><br />Good luck my friend.<br /><br />Be prepared for some pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)
