				So I was at a Big G concert a few months back and this guy comes up to me and shows me these caps with sort of crystals but sort of smashed gooeyness on the inside and said it was MDMA, and of course dub it &quot;The Rollin Heisenberg&quot; anyways I took one look at it and was like no thanks that looks bunk as fuck.<br /><br />sketchy dealer stranger continues to try and sell me on said questionable caps pulls out his phone and shows me pictures of these super sweet blue crystals all nice and shit and had the structure of what could look like some of the stuff I have seen on here IE the purple shards.&nbsp; Either way seeing the picture then seeing what was in the caps I passed.<br /><br />Since then I been going on a man hunt to look for anyone who may have it online. And found nothing, has anyone here had or seen blue molly before? And I&#039;m talking a nice light sky blue maybe a little darker but translucent to give it a description.<br /><br />Im thinking it was all bullshit all together or maybe he got some clear stuff and dyed it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				Do you mean full on blue? Or like grey blue? I have had some MD before which was like a blacky/grey/blue kinda colour, it was OK stuff.

				Years ago I found some purple mdma - that was the purest I ever had.<br />But it was clearly purple (when put on a white piece of paper). <br />Never found any blue mdma...

				They had a guy on here a few months ago selling blue mdma but it was cut up garbage. The reason that mdma was blue is because of dyes, it could have been from the exporting process to hide it, etc. If you ever do come across blue mdma again I suggest you acetone wash and make sure you are able to clean it up because if not, you&#039;re taking poison.

				There is no reason on earth for anyone to end up with blue MDMA. White, beige, brown, pink, yellow tinged are all possible hues. Blue? Nah!<br />\Either he&#039;s really fucked up his method or some foreign substance has been introduced at some stage.<br />

Some people use dye and perfumes to hide what it really is, definitely not good for you.

Personally, i&#039;d stay well clear!
