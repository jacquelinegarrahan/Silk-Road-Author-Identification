				Search the forums using &#039;reloaded&#039; and you will find a number of posts talking about it.&nbsp; From what I can recall of reading about it and the few times I checked the site out, I would probably avoid it.

				Haha yeah I had a look at it and decided to stick with SR. One of the best things about SR is the active forum which BM lacks.

				Yeah limetless, I was gonna say that I thought I had seen you there, the place is slow, most of the ranked sellers are international and sell CC <br />The forums are slow, but it&#039;s usually where the good vendors are, scammers don&#039;t usually post in the threads.<br />The thing is, anyone can become a seller, but the Admin has been taking actions to make it more restricted. <br /><br />go check it out, it&#039;s another world.
