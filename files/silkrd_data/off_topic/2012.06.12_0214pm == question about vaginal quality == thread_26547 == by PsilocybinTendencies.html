				I know this is an odd question.<br /><br />But bare with me because I didn&#039;t have much in the way of role models, and was one of those people who taught themselves about the birds and the bees by reading adolescent-adulthood.<br /><br />As a younger man, I thought vaginal quality directly corresponded to the slut-level of the woman in question.<br /><br />But experience has taught me that this is not the case.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had obviously promiscuous women whose pussy tasted like peaches and cream, and less sexually experienced women whose shit was disgusting.<br /><br />Then you&#039;ve got women whose pussies are nasty, but they&#039;ve clearly made an attempt to cover it up.<br /><br />So what causes this? Is it biology, and certain women are just genetically predisposed to taste and smell better?<br /><br />Is there some hygienic trick that some women know about, and some women don&#039;t?<br /><br />Is it a mix of all three factors?<br /><br />I really wanna know, because I really like to eat pussy when the conditions are right. And if in some women the conditions can be improved with a little work, that would be AMAZING.<br /><br />Or maybe it does have to do with slut level, and the more promiscuous ones don&#039;t wanna admit it, and the less experienced ones wanna act more experienced... and I&#039;m just naive...<br /><br />Any thoughts?

				If a girl has a guy cum inside her that&#039;ll make her pussy taste like crap for about a week, even if she&nbsp; has very good hygiene (cause you can&#039;t clean that deep inside really can you)..<br /><br />I tend to think that the sluttier the girl the worse it tastes, but there are obvious exceptions. Genetics are no doubt a part of it too.<br /><br />But in my experience, it&#039;s always the virgins with the best tasting pussies.. They&#039;re just.. I dunno.. Fertile.. Pheromonal..

				I think the biggest factor in vaginal taste/odor is the current stage of her menstrual cycle.<br />Her diet and genetics have an influence too.

				Sweat plays a factor too. I would believe Ballzinator is right about the menstrual cycle as well, as I&#039;ve had girls who taste fine and then go through a period of time where it smells bad just having sex without even going down.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think a guy cumming inside her matters, I do that all the time and my girlfriend rarely has an odor or bad taste.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been with many escorts and while I won&#039;t go down on them, many guys on TER forums do go down on escorts, but I&#039;ve never had an escort with a bad odor though I stick to the cleaner more professional girls and do my homework on their reviews and such. So that would confirm for me that sexual activity has nothing to do with it.

				Ok, I wasn&#039;t going to post, but it appears no other females have shown up in this thread&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />It actually is a good question.&nbsp; I think there are several reasons for the difference in taste.&nbsp; First, it&#039;s a genetic thing.&nbsp; Everybody smells and tastes different.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been with clean guys who tasted nasty, and guys who haven&#039;t. ( I am a female, btw). Some of it is just straight up hygeine.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t think the level of promiscuity has a lot to do with it, unless you&#039;re getting sloppy seconds or something.<br /><br />For me, it comes down to how much I care about the person, and vice versa.&nbsp; I live in a tropical climate, and of course we sweat a lot.&nbsp; But, being in love with my BF, I just LOVE the way he smells.&nbsp; And according to him, he feels the same.<br /><br />So, not to be too gross, but that&#039;s how it works with us.<br /><br />Sex advise on SR......never thought I&#039;d see the day!! :)

If your going to have sex - then wash it well! <br /><br />As for pussy taste, they all tasted good to me! <br /><br />I do recall one of the guys going down on a women who had just had sex with a good half a dozen men. I&#039;d feel sick myself.<br /><br />But every guy has tasted his own cum. When younger I&#039;d hit myself in the eye, face, on a regular basic. If we had an Olympic event for distance cum event it would be a younger guy. I can still it my own eye though. This is an accident. Actually strings a little. Maybe if you ever got attacked by a mugger you could smear some jism in his eyes. <br /><br />Ok, its getting late and I&#039;m talking shit. I&#039;m stoned on the daily medication of good old bud and hash. <br /><br />One of the guys I work with reckons that certain drugs can make you come with more velocity. Maybe it just feels that way.<br /><br />Plus the more you abstain the more jism a guy will have. Not sure how long it is before you have a &#039;full sack&#039; of sperm waiting to do their Olympic event competing with hundreds of millions of others with one winner (usually)<br /><br />Hygiene is important. I would not touch a women who was not clean. I only have one women so there is no issue there. If I taste my own sperm via that route then its nothing. If another mans sperm was there that would be a big issue. I&#039;d divorce the next day. <br /><br />And women have to exercise their vagina, especially if they have had kids but no matter - you exercise to make it tighter.. Female entertainers can take the top off a bottle with their pussy.<br /><br />Men cannot do much apart from exercise the muscle that controls the release of sperm. We can take Viagra but I never have because if I cannot get a hard on its for a good reason. <br /><br />Women&#039;s vaginas are like mens&#039; dicks - each is different! But all pussy that has been cleaned and not been used for a few weeks or months by any other man is beautiful. If she goes down on you always repay the compliment. Ask her - some women do not like oral sex near or just after a period. Oral sex during a period, no way I would do it. <br /><br />I&#039;m feeling peckish right now but Mrs Red works away in the week often and I am shift working on insane hours. I am employed to work more than actually working.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;d sooner eat pussy than do drugs!<br /><br />That says a lot!<br /><br />But lets be honest there is a limit. We can get suffocated by a women in the height of passion! But as ways of dying go its not a bad one!<br /><br />When Mrs Red asked me if she wanted to take our relationship to the &#039;next level&#039; I assumed she meant oral sex. <br /><br />The only time men do not talk shit is when we are busy down below. And the taste! I wish I could get a drip on it like coke!<br /><br />But afterwards I brush my teeth. Not right away. But I brush them all the same and gargle with some mouth wash. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to kiss my mother or aunts with pussy breath.

				There are some threads that I should just ignore.<br />But like a rabbit to a cobra... <br /><br />...and in sympathy with killerglass...<br /><br />from the fantastic and irreplaceable Violet Blue, who basically covers the entire topic.<br />don&#039;t even start with TL;DR<br /><br />hxxp://www.tinynibbles.com/cunnilingustaste<br />in case you could not figure out from the title, the site is NSFW, depending on your job<br />large-block excerpt, with apologies to VB if she is on here for pasting so much--<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The scent and taste of a woman has certain certainties, though the makeup of her personal cocktail will change from day to day. These changes depend on any number of factors, from the time in her cycle to whether she’s eaten raw garlic or takes multivitamins. If you’re wondering what’s in store for you when going face-to-face with her vulva, then perhaps a chemistry lesson is in order.<br /><br />In determining the combination of sensory information we perceive when we put something in our mouths, like food, it’s easy to make comparisons and get general ideas by taking a look at pH (acid/alkaline balance). For instance, on any given day, our skin’s pH hovers between 6.0 and 7.0, while the pH of a healthy, happy vagina hovers between a 3.8 and 4.5. Even though you won’t find pussy on the menu at your local café, you can sample a taste of items near her pH levels: have some black coffee (pH 5), try a lick of lemon (pH 2), or have a glass of the closest thing going, wine, which has the same pH range as the vagina.<br /><br />While we’re on the subject of food, it’s interesting to note that the friendly bacteria that protect the vagina from becoming the perfect hostess to germs are lactobacilli, the same bacteria found in yogurt. The lactic acid in vaginal secretions plays a big role in keeping the pH low. Healthy, juicy women will have a slightly sweet, slightly pungent scent, very near that of plain yogurt.<br /><br />The natural taste of a woman can range from slightly tangy to a slippery saltiness, to even having a hint of iron around the time of her menstrual cycle. Strong foods such as asparagus and garlic can influence her flavors, and so can vitamins. Flavors and aromas secreted from an aroused woman’s genitalia are so packed with chemicals and pheromones that they make a powerful biochemical aphrodisiac.<br /><br />However, this doesn’t mean that her chemistry will “click” with yours, or that your lover will have the same sweet taste every time you go down on her. Should you notice a marked change in your sweetie’s bouquet, and you have both established trust around oral sex, you might gently bring it to her attention, as it may warrant a health check.<br /><br />When a woman’s vaginal pH changes, her secretions become stronger smelling. Wine is now off the menu; yogurt will not be served with breakfast. It doesn’t take much to upset the balance and change the pH in the vaginal ecosystem, and three big polluters are douching, using a harsh soap, and semen. Douching is one of the biggest causes of vaginal infections. Regular soap is a surprisingly big offender — most body soaps range in pH anywhere from 7.0 to 14.<br /><br />Women with sensitive vaginas may want to use a low-pH soap, available at many beauty shops and health food stores, in place of regular soap. Choosing a low pH soap to use on your pussy may sound strange at first, but it’s highly recommended — and you use different soaps on your face, right? Look for soap that states a low pH on the label, soap made from goat’s milk, or naturally-made soaps (found in health food stores). Semen is so amazingly alkaline that it can change the scent of a woman within minutes.<br /><br />One little-known fact is that the human mouth is less hygienic than the vagina, and folks who are going down will want to do their own bit of washing up, too. Rinse your mouth with mouthwash, then water, to eliminate bacteria before you take the plunge. Don’t brush your teeth, however, especially if you’re not using safer sex barriers because brushing (and flossing) your teeth creates tiny cuts with which you may catch — or pass — an STD.<br /><br />Some men have thicker or thinner come than others, stronger or milder tasting or smelling come than others, and some will shoot a lot while others very little. There are many variables as to why, and some of the factors are diet, frequency of ejaculation, health and physiology.<br /><br />The taste of a woman can be neutral, slightly sweet or lightly tart, or stronger, salty, musky. Things that can make the flavor of a woman’s vaginal secretions strong or even pungent are vitamins, asparagus, beets, coffee, cigarettes, a diet high in red meats or garlic. Coffee in high doses (especially strong, like espresso) will make her taste slightly bitter. Curries influence flavor as well, and so can diets of spice-rich foods with little water intake. Strong foods like these can influence her secretions in much the same way as they can influence the scent of urine (like asparagus). To keep it smelling and tasting neutral, she can avoid these foods at least 24 hours before oral sex, and drink plenty of water.<br /><br />Carnivorous women tend to have stronger tasting bits than those who stick to vegetarian diets, though whether this is unpleasant or not to the person doing the tasting is up for debate.<br /><br />Another thing that affects the taste of a woman that is seldom talked about is — drugs. Over the counter and street drugs both make women’s genital secretions taste sharp, bitter and even rank: antihistamines are especially in this category. Most especially is the street drug speed (also including meth — aka crystal — and crack, as well as cocaine). According to the populations that I and other outreach health workers counsel for sexual health, speed can make a woman taste very unpleasant. But then I suppose, one might not notice or care. But it’s information worth sharing.<br /><br />Sweetening a woman’s natural essence is a whole different matter. Conventional wisdom on this subject (if there is such a thing) states that if she wants to make her pussy taste sweeter she should drink lots of citrus, pineapple or celery juice, and eat a lot of sweet melon. The more tropical juices and fruits (especially with elimination of bitter dietary factors), the sweeter the girl.<br /><br />Either way, tactful communication is the golden rule when you talk about her smell and taste. How each woman internalizes the rampant sexual shame about taste and smell is individually filtered and is coped with in infinite ways, from realizing it’s b.s. to actually believing she’s dirty and gross on some level.<br /><br />You know it yourself — there is nothing hotter under the sun than a lover who goes crazy for your tastes and smells, and makes it crystal clear that they absolutely love to have you in their mouth. Always be sensitive, and let her know how much you enjoy everything about her.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I am more interested in how pussies vary in terms of feel and size.<br /><br />As a young man, I thought sluts all had big cunt holes and they looked all busted up.

It is a common misconception that when a girl first has sex this will tear and cause lots of pain/blood/etc etc. In fact most girls manage to tear theirs before they have sex either through sports or using tampons. I think she was referring to breaking her hymen rather than stretching her entire vagina.<br /><br />I assume that you have never shagged a woman who has had a baby. If your theory held true then it would be like chucking a B&amp;H down Oxford Street but in reality the muscles and tissue regain most, if not all, of their original size and shape. <br /><br />To permanently stretch it like you are describing would need long periods of penetration with very big things over a long period of time, think German Porno rather than having a diddle.

These changes depend on any number of factors, from the time in her cycle to whether she’s eaten raw garlic or takes multivitamins. If you’re wondering what’s in store for you when going face-to-face with her vulva, then perhaps a chemistry lesson is in order.<br /><br />In determining the combination of sensory information we perceive when we put something in our mouths, like food, it’s easy to make comparisons and get general ideas by taking a look at pH (acid/alkaline balance). For instance, on any given day, our skin’s pH hovers between 6.0 and 7.0, while the pH of a healthy, happy vagina hovers between a 3.8 and 4.5. Even though you won’t find pussy on the menu at your local café, you can sample a taste of items near her pH levels: have some black coffee (pH 5), try a lick of lemon (pH 2), or have a glass of the closest thing going, wine, which has the same pH range as the vagina.<br /><br />While we’re on the subject of food, it’s interesting to note that the friendly bacteria that protect the vagina from becoming the perfect hostess to germs are lactobacilli, the same bacteria found in yogurt. The lactic acid in vaginal secretions plays a big role in keeping the pH low. Healthy, juicy women will have a slightly sweet, slightly pungent scent, very near that of plain yogurt.<br /><br />The natural taste of a woman can range from slightly tangy to a slippery saltiness, to even having a hint of iron around the time of her menstrual cycle. Strong foods such as asparagus and garlic can influence her flavors, and so can vitamins. Flavors and aromas secreted from an aroused woman’s genitalia are so packed with chemicals and pheromones that they make a powerful biochemical aphrodisiac.<br /><br />However, this doesn’t mean that her chemistry will “click” with yours, or that your lover will have the same sweet taste every time you go down on her. Should you notice a marked change in your sweetie’s bouquet, and you have both established trust around oral sex, you might gently bring it to her attention, as it may warrant a health check.<br /><br />When a woman’s vaginal pH changes, her secretions become stronger smelling. Wine is now off the menu; yogurt will not be served with breakfast. It doesn’t take much to upset the balance and change the pH in the vaginal ecosystem, and three big polluters are douching, using a harsh soap, and semen. Douching is one of the biggest causes of vaginal infections. Regular soap is a surprisingly big offender — most body soaps range in pH anywhere from 7.0 to 14.<br /><br />Women with sensitive vaginas may want to use a low-pH soap, available at many beauty shops and health food stores, in place of regular soap. Choosing a low pH soap to use on your pussy may sound strange at first, but it’s highly recommended — and you use different soaps on your face, right? Look for soap that states a low pH on the label, soap made from goat’s milk, or naturally-made soaps (found in health food stores). Semen is so amazingly alkaline that it can change the scent of a woman within minutes.<br /><br />One little-known fact is that the human mouth is less hygienic than the vagina, and folks who are going down will want to do their own bit of washing up, too. Rinse your mouth with mouthwash, then water, to eliminate bacteria before you take the plunge. Don’t brush your teeth, however, especially if you’re not using safer sex barriers because brushing (and flossing) your teeth creates tiny cuts with which you may catch — or pass — an STD.<br /><br />Some men have thicker or thinner come than others, stronger or milder tasting or smelling come than others, and some will shoot a lot while others very little. There are many variables as to why, and some of the factors are diet, frequency of ejaculation, health and physiology.<br /><br />The taste of a woman can be neutral, slightly sweet or lightly tart, or stronger, salty, musky. Things that can make the flavor of a woman’s vaginal secretions strong or even pungent are vitamins, asparagus, beets, coffee, cigarettes, a diet high in red meats or garlic. Coffee in high doses (especially strong, like espresso) will make her taste slightly bitter. Curries influence flavor as well, and so can diets of spice-rich foods with little water intake. Strong foods like these can influence her secretions in much the same way as they can influence the scent of urine (like asparagus). To keep it smelling and tasting neutral, she can avoid these foods at least 24 hours before oral sex, and drink plenty of water.<br /><br />Carnivorous women tend to have stronger tasting bits than those who stick to vegetarian diets, though whether this is unpleasant or not to the person doing the tasting is up for debate.<br /><br />Another thing that affects the taste of a woman that is seldom talked about is — drugs. Over the counter and street drugs both make women’s genital secretions taste sharp, bitter and even rank: antihistamines are especially in this category. Most especially is the street drug speed (also including meth — aka crystal — and crack, as well as cocaine). According to the populations that I and other outreach health workers counsel for sexual health, speed can make a woman taste very unpleasant. But then I suppose, one might not notice or care. But it’s information worth sharing.<br /><br />Sweetening a woman’s natural essence is a whole different matter. Conventional wisdom on this subject (if there is such a thing) states that if she wants to make her pussy taste sweeter she should drink lots of citrus, pineapple or celery juice, and eat a lot of sweet melon. The more tropical juices and fruits (especially with elimination of bitter dietary factors), the sweeter the girl.<br /><br />Either way, tactful communication is the golden rule when you talk about her smell and taste. How each woman internalizes the rampant sexual shame about taste and smell is individually filtered and is coped with in infinite ways, from realizing it’s b.s. to actually believing she’s dirty and gross on some level.<br /><br />You know it yourself — there is nothing hotter under the sun than a lover who goes crazy for your tastes and smells, and makes it crystal clear that they absolutely love to have you in their mouth. Always be sensitive, and let her know how much you enjoy everything about her.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I just looked up the word vulva on wiki, and all I can say is...Good find.
