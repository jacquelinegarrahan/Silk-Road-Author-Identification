				Do you think governmetns and pro-government supporters (patriots and even wealthy people) would ever come to discussion forums like these and try to spread pro-government propaganda? I mean there&#039;s obviously a lot of young minds here. And we know how much the government loves to target young people, to spread patriotism and even to enlist soldiers for military recruitment.<br /><br />What do you think?

				It&#039;s possible, but they do plenty of that through the mainstream media and public school systems already.

				Nopeeee, most young minds here are anti-authoritarian. I don`t think this place has potential for becoming a mass of human experiments.

				Well I scored in the 98th percentile on my ASVAB test and literally had navy, marine, and army recruiters driving to my house on a weekly basis trying to kidnap me and take me to their brainwashing centers. So I wouldn&#039;t be the least bit surprised if they attempted to recruit young people on discussion boards. They&#039;re sure as hell dedicated though, they drove me crazy my senior year. &gt;:(

				As for forums other than this one, recruiting through them would be inefficient compared to other means. Especially here in Japan, there`s no door to door recruiting happening. Most forces are taught defensive/evasive programs and others aren`t interested in Nationalism or such.

I was experimenting with the military last year and got a 94 ASVAB with perfect line scores.

Then the anxiety kicked in and I asked to use the bathroom, grabbed my shit, tore off my name tag at MEPS and escaped from the federal building. It was shameful but all my friends who&#039;ve joined the military are really screwed up and miserable. <br /><br />There&#039;s nothing from stopping a DEA agent or somebody from posting on here for fun and trolling.

				The military trying to recruit on these boards?&nbsp; Who here could pass the drug and background checks - or even want to?<br /><br />I can maybe see the feds trying some psych ops but trying to pull a Goebbles here would almost be like trying to find Mother Teresa&#039;s replacement at the headquarters of Goldman Sachs.

				Well I don&#039;t imagine they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on persona management software for nothing<br /><br />http://dissociatedpress.com/2011/02/on-the-internet-nobody-knows-you-are-a-personality-management-software/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">.....“persona management” software that allows the user of the software to appear online as an army of commenters to manipulate opinion and erode online trust, much like Digg Patriots.&nbsp; It’s questionable how effective the tool would be at this point in terms of creating credible personas, but what is actually more worrying about this kind of tool is the latter notion. We’re already bombarded daily by various forms of phishing attempts, but what if all our social network interactions, blog commenting, and Twitter/RSS feeds were partially tainted by an intelligently-crafted stream of consensus manipulation, as that DailyKos piece suggests? Oh, and by the way. The US government is an interested customer. I look forward to your comments, even if you ARE just a piece of sentiment-manipulating software.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The past year or two in particular they have been spending a lot of money and time on software that lets a single agent easily manage hundreds of nyms with distinct personality characteristics. The two primary purposes I can think of for such software are increasing human intelligence capabilities (instead of a case officer managing 100 paid human intelligent agents, they can simulate being 100 human intelligent agents on the internet by using the software), and of course polluting the view of consensus on the internet in psychological operations.
