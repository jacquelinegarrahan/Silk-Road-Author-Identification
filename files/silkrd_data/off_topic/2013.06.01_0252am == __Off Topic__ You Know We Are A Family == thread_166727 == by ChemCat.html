				I wouldn&#039;t have been inspired to hang around here near as much if it weren&#039;t for you CC!&nbsp; RL gets to me sometimes, but I know I can come here and you can put a smirk on my face.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a lot in the past to create myself an &quot;island&quot; but it&#039;s things like these that remind me I need some kind of community no matter where I go.&nbsp; So many good thoughts have been forged here, that I can carry through out my day, I wouldn&#039;t have had otherwise.<br /><br />It says about her, to be able to still continue on and do acts on her behalf.&nbsp; It warms me to hear how long you guys have been together.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry it wasn&#039;t longer.

				I don&#039;t know you at all, but I wish you all the best and good luck on your mission!<br /><br />Also, my condolences for the loss of your wife, I cannot imagine how tight two people must be after spending so many years together, and how great the loss must be. I can only hope to one day meet the woman I want to grow old with.

				Hey ChemCat,<br /><br />I don&#039;t know you as well as some folks, I&#039;m still relatively new here. But I just want to reach out and show my support to you during this difficult time. It must be really tough. A member of my family is very ill and close to the end as well, but I can&#039;t imagine what it must feel to like to lose a companion of 60+ years (did I do the math right?).&nbsp; I&#039;m very sorry for your loss.<br /><br />Stay strong my brother

				I really used to feel like I found a family here too.&nbsp; I spent most of my life trying to accept myself, but I honestly had never felt like anyone else really accepted me until I started hanging around here.&nbsp; It was a very nice feeling for awhile; the community just feels different these days, but I&#039;m very glad that there are still those who feel this way.&nbsp; If I&#039;m honest, I still do sometimes too...<br /><br />Best wishes and all that&nbsp; :)

My health is good ...but my back is bad.<br />Amazing, the people with cancer that my wife named are the people we actually spent time with from time to time.<br />Those people were so afraid to try to get a medical marijuuana card though. Good for me i guess...My wife was amazing when she was alive...she is still amazing ....though she is gone.<br />In her dying days she made sure that i would be able to take care of myself....man i&#039;m going to cry ???<br />i&#039;ll live my days left here with you all and doing what i do for others.<br />:)<br /><br />Much Love from Me to You All :)<br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				Guys , I need to rally the troops , so to speak - nothing we can&#039;t handle , Mary is close to being driven off the board by all the false accusations being leveled at her about being this &quot;&nbsp; joolz &quot; person , in the uk cannabis thread .<br /><br />She&#039;s been in tears over it and It only dawned on me last night how much shit she&#039;s been having to put&nbsp; up with , it&#039;s not trolling , their making her forum life a nightmare and with all the other shit she&#039;s had to deal with of late - it needs to stop , or we may lose her =( .<br /><br />She can laugh the troll off , but this other shit is something she&#039;s needs backup on , I&#039;ve been talking to the culprits and just need a few more people to help me talk some sense in to them .<br /><br />I &#039;m certain you all will be there for her , now we realize how much it;s upsetting her , we need to stick together as a family and stick for our sister .<br /><br />Pass the word on , I&#039;ll reconvene with Y&#039;all later , but for now read the last few pages of the uk weed thread and you&#039;ll see the sate of play .<br /><br />BTW Mary said that us sticking up for her , means more then we will ever know - nuff said .<br /><br />I&#039;m going to post this here&nbsp; in the family thread so it doesn&#039;t get drowned out , it&#039;s important for us to do this - plus it&#039;s a a family thing , no sister of mine is getting bullied ,&nbsp; not while I still draw breath .<br /><br />I Know your all with me on this , that&#039;s why I love you all =)<br /><br /><br />

				heres my help.....get a large blue IV needle with say a 2ml barrel,find the femoral artery(its right at the top of your leg by the groin area) cherry red blood will fill the barrel once you find it.when you think your in the right spot pull the barrel back and forth violently so the needle rips the artery(this is quite painless)....job done.have a nice afterlife,if there is one.<br /><br />BTW cyanide is a nasty painful death

				Awwwww Chemmy.... I just wanna give you the biggest hug!&nbsp; Mary, bless her heart... she first told me about this thread which is just incredible... then she encouraged me to read your story on the first page.&nbsp; As you know...&nbsp; I&#039;d already known of your loss from spare coin, and I figured that was probably what your story was about... and it was.&nbsp; I was almost afraid to read it (even though of course I was going to anyway) because I was sure it was going to make me cry and I&#039;d not be able to stop.&nbsp; Instead, atm... I&#039;m just about speechless. Your story... what you wrote and how you wrote it...&nbsp; it&#039;s tragic and terribly sad...&nbsp; but at the same time.. so beautiful and honest.&nbsp; I am so in awe of you right now.&nbsp; It&#039;s just so amazing..&nbsp; you really did spend a lifetime with the love of your life...&nbsp; and you are still carrying on... still doing whatever it is that is important to you and to your wife.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly certain that you know that she knows, too.&nbsp; You feel her presence..&nbsp; I know about that and am pretty sure that you will continue to do so until the two of you are reunited in a world that just has to be a whole lot better than this one.&nbsp; Somehow, I think you feel this to be true too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Well..&nbsp; I could stumble along for quite a while longer... but I think I&#039;ll stop here.&nbsp; And also, fwiw, I haven&#039;t had any family still living (except for one sister who I love dearly but has a busy life, lives on the other side of the country and we rarely see each other) for a long time.&nbsp; Everyone else I love has already made it to the next world.&nbsp; I came one day to an online black market looking for one thing I needed - not a drug as they have always seemed to find me easily IRL - I ordered and received my item and yet I kept coming back.&nbsp; Not to shop - well..&nbsp; a couple of small items here and there... but I keep coming back because I found, completely by accident...&nbsp; something I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d have again on this earth....&nbsp; the same thing you found..&nbsp; a Family.&nbsp; A real Family!&nbsp; No matter where they live IRL, or the names their parents gave them...&nbsp; their words are genuine, their caring is real...&nbsp; I can feel it.&nbsp; Not everyone on SR of course,&nbsp; but the ones who are here...&nbsp; in this thread... the good ones from spare coin...&nbsp; and well..&nbsp; you know who they are.&nbsp; And I have a feeling I have YOU first and foremost to thank for bringing us together.&nbsp; You truly have a beautiful soul, as I&#039;m sure does your wife as well.<br /><br />Enough of my blithering on here...&nbsp; just...&nbsp; gimme a hug when I cya...&nbsp; O.K?<br /><br />Much love to you :)<br />foxen ;)&nbsp; xxx

				Just popped in real quick to say hi to the family ;)&nbsp; There are getting to be so many kind souls amongst us that I no longer try to list by name as I always leave a few out unintentionally.. lol..&nbsp; &nbsp; :)&nbsp; Anyway, hope everyone is doing well and having a great time doing whatever it is that makes you happy ;D<br /><br />My computer is still giving me fits...&nbsp; pretty sure it&#039;s not compromised as I&#039;ve scanned it with multiple programs and all comes up clean as well as it&#039;s overheating and the hdd is about 99% full...&nbsp; mostly things I don&#039;t even need.. thinking of seriously taking some time to really learn linux.. something I should have put time into a lot sooner than now, then using this cheapy one to re-format the hdd and put a linux distro on it to practice on so I know what I&#039;m doing when I replace the preinstalled windows 8 on my brand new otherwise really nice computer that I refuse to use as long as windows is on it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, didn&#039;t mean to carry on about that..&nbsp; except for that I guess I want you guys/gals to know that if I happen to disappear for a day or so...&nbsp; it would be for no reason other than computer problems and such.&nbsp; Although I seriously hope it won&#039;t come to that cuz I&#039;d really miss my Family if I missed more than a day as is how I feel right now....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Take care everyone ;) :-*<br /><br />foxen....&nbsp; :)

				Hey Mary... if I seem to be following you around.. it&#039;s not intentional.. lol.. just sayin&#039;&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But what you just wrote... yeah, apparently the feds have been monitoring this site for quite some time.. and while I don&#039;t necesarily believe everything in that long inditement - as the alphabet soup types do I suppose deserve a bit of credit for being quite skilled at putting out just the right mixture of misinformation, disinformation and just enough bits and pieces of truth to make them believeable to many ....&nbsp; &nbsp;but still... the part about how they have been able to read PM&#039;s between people (at least between DPR and the mods - so they say)...&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t trust that to be untrue.&nbsp; I hope that everyone who is still here is careful to encrypt any PM&#039;s of anything that the feds might or might not find important... because as someone&#039;s signature says (sorry, I forget just who it was atm):&nbsp; No one has ever been sorry for having been too careful, but there are many who have been sorry for not having been careful enough...&nbsp; something to that effect...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, whether or not they think they are gaining anything from keeping the forums open when they so suddenly shut down the road... leaving everyone with no access to their coins or knowing where anything was.... if it was DPR they were after...&nbsp; then the only reason I can see for them having shut the site so abruptly, would have been for the purpose of confiscating all the bitcoins from all over the site.&nbsp; &nbsp;There must be some reason why the forums are still open when it doesn&#039;t look as if DPR is running them...&nbsp; and somehow, I kind of doubt that it&#039;s because they are feeling badly for having made all of us become &quot;collateral damage&quot;.&nbsp; But they had better have a damn good reason to be putting all the time and expense they had to have invested in taking out the tinyest community in the universe...&nbsp; I mean, just because of all the people who have lost their jobs, kids who are suddenly cut off of their life saving cancer meds, etc, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t any of them who are in positions of &quot;authority&quot; have any morals or see reasonable priorities at all?&nbsp; Obvoiusly not..&nbsp; I guess once one becomes a piece of a can of alphabet soup, they must lose their soul....&nbsp; :-/

				Lol Foxen, I&#039;m following you now!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I think the msg&#039;s they have were because the person the msg&#039;s were sent to was a Fed so if DPR deleted his msg&#039;s the agent would still have them all if the &quot;hit&quot; story is to be believed anyway!? This is going to be an interesting court case to say the least! I&#039;m struggling to believe one man alone ran this site but then again I was shocked they were in the US of all places! We&#039;ll see what comes out in court, is it the 9th Oct the court&#039;s been put off till?
