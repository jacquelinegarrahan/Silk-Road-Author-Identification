				Hello.<br /><br />For 2 mounths ago i was charged for armed robbery with 5 of my friend, an they held me for custody 4 weeks - while the evidence was being layed out.<br />When i went to court 4 weeks later, i got cleaned, and all the charges was dropped on me.<br />But, the final trial was 10 days ago, and i didnt know it, and i haven&#039;t recieved a letter from the police sayin i should go to court, so the trial was put on held for another 4 weeks, becouse i didnt sshow up at the court, for something i got cleaned on?.<br /><br />So my question is, should i go to court? or not? becouse they didnt send me a letter where it says i should go to court.

				Depending on where you live you might be legally obligated to attend court and you could get charged if you don&#039;t.<br /><br />Are you sure 100% sure the charges have actually been dropped and weren&#039;t just suspended temporarily due to lack of evidence?<br /><br />For gods sake bro get a lawyer!

				Whenever you have legal proceedings you should double-check when and if you&#039;re supposed to show in court.&nbsp; Try to get it on paper if possible.&nbsp; If you have a lawyer he should be on top of this.

				Some places you can call the sheriff or whoever serves warrants and ask if they have a warrant for you. Where I live I don&#039;t have to give my name, they recognize my voice. Paper work gets fucked up all time. Or ASK YOUR FUCKING LAWYER .

				If you actually committed armed robbery, you should go to court then, hopefully, jail.
