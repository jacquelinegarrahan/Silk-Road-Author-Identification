				So lately I&#039;ve been getting more interested in the NBOMe series of chemicals. I have some 25i-NBOMe on the way so that I can contribute to the scarce information about this chemical series. I&#039;d like to get my hands on even more of them, and may be pursuing a degree or at least quite a few chemistry classes so I could produce and learn more about them myself.<br /><br />So what about other SR users, have you used any NBOMe&#039;s? Any tips on usage, safety, or anything else in general about NBOMe&#039;s?<br /><br />P.S. I put this thread in off-topic and not drug safety because I&#039;d like the scope of the thread to extend beyond just safety issues, but anything about the NBOMe series in general.

				Here is a link to one of my experiences with 25i-nbome:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7975.msg72398#msg72398<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend taking as much as I did, or smoking/vaping it your first time. <br /><br />If you bought your 25i in power form, chances are it is in freebase form, you are unfortunately in a bit of a predicament. Freebase 25i is water insoluble, and inactive in buccal/sublingual/nasal/oral, at least that is what I am told from the big and dandy 25i-nbome thread on bluelight. Also, in that thread, there are a few different ways to get it into solution to aid in dosage measurement and/or laying blotter.<br /><br />As far as the experience goes, during the come-up there is a small bit of anxiety which will increase as dosage increases. Nothing too bad, just a wee bit of... mental unsettling, if that makes sense. The heart of the trip is where all the awesomeness happens. You&#039;ll get lots of tracers, enhanced vibrancy, and color distortion. There is a small stomach-in-the-throat feeling that increases as dosage increases. You might also get sweaty hands, at least I did.<br /><br />As far as safety goes, you *can* take quite a bit of this but that does not at all mean you *should*. I read a report of someone accidentally taking 30mg and he is still alive with no long-term effects.<br /><br />Hope this helps. If there is anything else you need to know, don&#039;t hesitate to ask.

				Thanks, what I ordered was 1mg on blotter from missit, so I guess I&#039;ll see how orally active it is whenever it gets here, if it gets here.

				If it is on blotter, it is almost certainly orally active; otherwise there is no point in laying blotter. Just freebase powder is inactive orally.

				25i-nbome is an awesome psych. I like 1.5-2.5 mg and it is excellent with amphetamines :)<br /><br />-RI

Erowid has it as being extremely strong, I was considering just going for the 500ug option.

				NBOMe blotters still aren&#039;t orally active. You have to keep the blotters on your toungue/swill saliva around for like half an hour to get good effects (lots of personal experience here). Best thing is to buy HCl powder and put it into water and snort the water using a oral syringe (like 500ug/ml or so)

				I like 25i-nBome it was my fav for awhile.....&nbsp; its&nbsp; designed for specific purpose to isolate psychedelic effects in the brain to certain key receptors for scientific study (by research lab chemists) unlike the 2c&#039;s which Shulgin designed out of a personal desire to explore the human mind in a less conventional way.&nbsp; So they are bit of a hybrid in terms of what they have been designed for. <br /><br />People have posted it lacks the spiritual depth of things like LSD and my experiences lead me to agree that the thought process are not particular profound though it can help gain insight into personal issues.&nbsp; I enjoyed it at first because of all the nbome&#039;s it has a nice high which is very pleasant and fantastic hallucinogenic visual effect which can be very impressive at high doses. The high is not like mdma - more mda then mdma though you feel some connection to others conversations,&nbsp; but they can get messy and difficult. It doesn&#039;t get to the loved up feeling of that substance. The problem with 2cX and nBome is they can cause death (though no info seems to be around to provide evidence at which point this might occur) - so large doses with this substances I would say is unwise.&nbsp; Still maybe there is great potential in them, yet to be discovered for those that want to push boundaries.<br /><br />No real comedown either but it can cause a painful headache the day after. 25c-nombe is visually interesting but no real hi to speak of - basically a novelty RC with not much use.<br /><br />25d-nbome - be interested to hear more about it for other users, has a really good mellow pleasantness with very clear focused thoughts. I needed to take it to a higher dose however to experience the full visual effect i think. <br /><br />And whatever happened with 25b-nbome i&#039;ve never seen a reasonably priced listing ? not worthwhile ?

				Before taking 25 NBOME, i highly recommend reading this entire thread. It&#039;s lengthy, but, i really..really..Really recommend the time to read it thoroughly.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9425.0<br />
