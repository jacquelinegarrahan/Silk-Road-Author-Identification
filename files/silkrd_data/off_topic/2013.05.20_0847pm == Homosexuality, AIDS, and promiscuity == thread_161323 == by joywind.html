				AIDS is considered a public health crisis again in San Fransisco and NYC because straight white men are having sex with women -- it has nothing to do with gays fucking 12 guys a week without a condom<br /><br />There&#039;s some cunt from Argentina who has written that Polish people are too &#039;intolerant&#039; and conservative and that the only thing that can help them is to see more gays, trannies, and prostitutes on the streets. The optimal city is one in which public fisting is an hourly display on street corners.<br /><br />That kind of thing is especially offensive when its directed against Africa and the like too. Africa has a massive AIDS problem - shitlibs suggest they need MORE vice and sodomy. It&#039;s like saying we should send free whiskey to Indian reservations.<br /><br />Maybe the underdeveloped world has reasons for not thinking sodomy is a swell thing?<br /><br />I like AIDS in the developed world b/c it takes care of awful people. But Third World people often catch dat AIDS due to things that aren&#039;t really their fault.<br />

Give me one motherfucker and I&#039;ll label them crazy. Note, giving them more condoms to prevent them from impregnating others and getting said STDs doesn&#039;t count, regardless of your thoughts on the matter. If libs were pro-viagra for third world nations you might have a case.<br /><br />Also, suck my STD free &#039;tranny&#039; cock. I&#039;m sure you&#039;d enjoy it.<br /><br />Seriously, did some guy buttfuck you against your will? I&#039;m still trying to comprehend why the hell it&#039;s any of your business what the hell other dudes and chicks consensually do with their naughty bits. Even if you find it disgusting, why the hell do you care?<br /><br />I guess it makes your own sodomy kinkier when you talk about how evil it is. I hope you enjoy the eminent shock therapy and various other tortures you&#039;ll experience at gay to straight conversion camp when you can&#039;t live with your burning homosexuality any longer.<br /><br />Ad hominem may not be a valid argument, but it&#039;s far more enjoyable and just as valid as your shitty points.<br /><br />P.S.- if you want less vice and sodomy in Africa, how do you propose we stop humans from exercising one of their most primal inclinations- fucking?
