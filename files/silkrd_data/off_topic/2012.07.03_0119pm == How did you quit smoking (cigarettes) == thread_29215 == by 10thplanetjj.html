				I used to smoke heavily when I worked a high-stress job, but then I took a step back and realized how fucking gross they made me feel. I noticed my teeth wasn&#039;t as white as they used to be. I thought how fucking nasty they made everything taste. The thing that finally made me stop was I had the most intense breakthrough on Salvia that made me want to rip off my own skin and start over again. Afterwards I couldn&#039;t stand the fucking things, then my grandfather died of lung cancer and I swore to never touch another cigarette again so long as I live.<br /><br />There&#039;s no real easy way to quite that will work for everyone other than you&#039;ve just got to have the willpower to stop yourself. You might find yourself orally fixated on things once you quit, so buy things to replace it like candy canes. That&#039;s what my friend did to quit, whenever he&#039;d get the urge to smoke a cigarette he&#039;d suck on a lollypop or candy cane, something like that. ;)<br /><br />Good luck though, not everyone&#039;s fortunate enough to quit as easily as I did and it can be horrible attempting it, but stay strong and work through it for your own sake! :D

				Alan Carrs easy way to stop smoking.... I thought &#039;BS&#039; when someone suggested it to me, I don&#039;t buy into self help books but fuck me, it worked. Its available as an audio book too, on the pirate bay i&#039;d imagine. I listened to it walking to work and back everyday for a couple of weeks, you smoke whilst reading the book and after I smoked my last one (as instructed in the last part of the book) I was free from nicotine slavery for 6 years after a 13 year addiction. Minimal cravings, even when I drank my willpower was much more powerful than the tiny urge to smoke I had. <br /><br />The book just helps you understand nicotine addiction in great detail, once you understand its workings it empowers you with the tools to quit.<br /><br />But guess what, like a dick i started smoking the odd cigar, couple a year... that turned into having a 1 fag when I was drinking once a week, before I know it i&#039;m smoking every day. Nicotine is a sneaky fucker. I&#039;m only on 3 or 4 a day but I&#039;m going to listen to the book again.<br /><br />Worst drug on the planet.

				Above method works pretty well, although I stopped cold turkey, worked fine for months, then decided to smoke again lol<br /><br />You have to be in the right position to do it as well as REALLY wanting it.<br /><br />Also, Nicoderm etc do work, however the reason they work is that when you try to smoke a cig, you&#039;ll get nauseous and not want the cig, so it basically conditions you to not smoke them so that you don&#039;t puke :P<br /><br />Mental support also helps, if you have any friends who don&#039;t smoke and want you to stop talk to them about it :)

				I will also echo the above comments that you do REALLY do have to want to quit, you have to have a hate for it, I even hated myself for smoking, it was a thorn in my side.

				Funny this thread comes up now, just an hour after i&#039;ve had my very last cigarette.&nbsp; Well (hopefully...) hmm.&nbsp; I&#039;ve decided to go cold turkey after 5 years to the day.&nbsp; The thing that is so hard to grasp right now is the thought of not doing it in social situations.&nbsp; Luckily, the delightful presence of joints plays a role in most of my social circle&#039;s parties, etc. So I can still drink while I smoke!&nbsp; When I smoke bongs I just use straight weed, so I wont miss it there, however, when I roll joints I do use about 25 percent tobacco.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking that if the quitting goes really well I might need to use something else as spin, or it could lure me back and kickstart cravings again.<br /><br />I have found the gum to be somewhat effective in relieving some physical withdrawal symptoms, however it doesn&#039;t stop my psychological cravings, especially while doing things where I used to smoke (with coffee, etc)<br /><br />As for you 10th, no advice, I&#039;m pretty weak with cigarettes, although I only smoke 7 or 8 in a day.&nbsp; The thought of it being forever is a bit scary...I guess you&#039;ve got to draw the line somewhere.<br />At this point, I&#039;ve had the idea of allowing myself to have a cigarette if I feel I unquestionably should during a peak experience. I&#039;m thinking that I would definitely want to allow myself to have a cigarette while on MDMA, but definitely not just a normal weekend out drinking.&nbsp; Maybe by drawing a line, saying you don&#039;t have to never have one again, therefore not being so strict as to adopt the &quot;all or nothing&quot; approch, you&#039;ll be comfortable not smoking tobacco for a short to mid-term because you wont fear missing it as much.<br />Hmm ramble ramble i&#039;m high<br />lol<br />Good luck dude.

				I was smoking ten a day, and I decided it was time to quit.<br /><br />For one pack I smoked 5 a day.<br />Next pack I smoked 4 a day.<br />Then 3 a day.<br /><br />Then my friend gave me a few baggies of various strains of cannabis and I switched over to being high 24/7.

				it sounds tacky but it&#039;s 100% true: i used CVS brand nic patches. <br /><br />the fact that i knew smoking would make me feel ill kept me from cheating, and the nic drip into my system made it so i was able to give up the habit before the addiction (every other time i&#039;d tried to quit i&#039;d get full-blown confused/frustrated/angry from fits).<br /><br />i&#039;m three months smoke free! it rules.

Besides, it&#039;s got to be a whole lot better than smoking cigarettes right? It&#039;s even better if you learn how to grow your own, it&#039;ll really help get your mind off of smoking tobacco. :D

				What you need to do is develop a case of bronchitis. That will get you to stop smoking for a week. Or watch this video on how cigarettes are made. Or try smoking an American Spirit cigarette. I bet you won&#039;t finish the pack. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0XuRfJcatg

				I always smoked weed while also being addicted to cigarettes, so in order to quit I started smoking spliffs, thus cutting back on my weed consumption as well. After a few weeks of smoking only spliffs, I started using less tobacco until I was rolling pure joints of just weed. Never was a fan of any of the patches or gums or any of that crap. The good ol&#039; slow-weening/cold-turkey always worked for me.

				how i did it is a weird way but it worked for me. ok to start off i absolutely hate menthol, i just cant stand it. so the first few weeks of quitting i bought shitty cheap menthol cigarettes and whenever i would crave and smoke it would remind me. i wouldn&#039;t allow myself to buy the cigarettes that i enjoy and eventually i convinced myself it wasn&#039;t worth it. but its true that you have to want it for yourself

				Toothpicks, start eating toothpicks, keep them in your mouth like a gangsta would. Hell flavor them by soaking them in some nice liquid.&nbsp; It keeps your mouth busy, and when your going cold turkey (the best way to quit smokes) you can always use it as a stress reliever bite down destroy that piece of shit then start afresh with a new one.

				When you say you exercise 4 time a week, what do you do?<br /><br />I started doing BJJ and kickboxing. After rolling around for 5mins not being able to catch my breath motivated me to stop. Didnt have a cig for nearly 6yrs but now finding myself occasionally smoke when I drink now. Will have to cut that out for good.

				On substituting marijuana in for cigarettes:<br /><br />Not for every obviously. I have several reasons for smoking marijuana beyond recreation, so for me it was only logical to transfer from cigarettes to weed.<br /><br />Also, I can be high 24/7 for weeks straight then be sober for a week with no issue, whereas I got irritable when I had already smoked 4 cigarettes out of 4 for the day and it was only 10 pm.<br /><br />Anyway, the high from marijuana is stronger, more pleasant, and longer lasting than that from nicotine, which makes it a fairly easy switch, especially if you switch to being high 24/7.

				I gave up many times before I finally gave up for good in 2001. I&#039;d tried everything from cold turkey to snuff to nicotine chewing gum and I&#039;d managed to quit for up for as long as three years, but always relapsed, usually in a bar when someone was offering round the ciggies.<br /><br />I finally managed to give up by using Nicorette inhalators, supplied to me free by the National Health Service in the UK. The inhalator a little thing that looks like a cigarette holder that you load with a nicotine cartridge and suck on to get your nicotine hit, just like smoking except with no smoke.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the freedom. I could smoke everywhere, in restaurants, bars, cinemas, public transport, planes. other peoples houses, etc, etc. As a smoker you don&#039;t realise just how stressful and restrictive your life has become.<br /><br />Then I started replacing the nicotine cartridge less and less until after a year I realised that I was just sucking on air and no longer needed it. I binned it and never smoked since :)
