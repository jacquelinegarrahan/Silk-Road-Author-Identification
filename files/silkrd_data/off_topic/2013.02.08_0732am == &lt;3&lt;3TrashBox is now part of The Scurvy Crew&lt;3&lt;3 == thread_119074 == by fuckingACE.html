				Hi LOVESSSSSSS! <br /><br />It’s me, TrashBox, and I’m proud to announce I’ve joined the Scurvy Crew!<br /><br />Ace is very busy these days and can’t be around as much as he’d like, so I’ll be here to keep everyone informed of the goings ons of TSC. Most of the time I’ll post from my TrashBox account but if I post here I’ll sign TB. Also, messages sent to this account will be checked by me unless you type ACE ONLY in the subject line. <br /><br />FYI to my fellow Americans: TSC will soon be shipping our yummy hash domestically! That means no customs and even FASTER shipping. Be excited, my friends ;)<br /><br />Theme song for my weekend: &quot;No Church In The Wild&quot; JayZ&nbsp; www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJt7gNi3Nr4 <br /><br />XOXO TB<br />

				Ace&#039;s business picked up so much (thanks to the hash) that he had to hire help. Please let me assure you that we are very secure and if anyone has any specific questions please feel free to PM me or ACE and we&#039;ll address any concerns you might have.<br />

				I don&#039;t like the hookup with US domestic operations. <br />&nbsp;This will put TSC on the radar of the DEA and I am sure they would love to bust such an operation as it would be PR to the likes of &quot;Multinational drug dealer ring busted&quot;.<br />&nbsp;Will your US operation also see non-US orders? I would no send my address then and look for another vendor although I am most happy with their sativa hash.<br />Howard Marks aka Mr.Nice only got busted because he ventured into supplying fascist America - and it was way more relaxed then.

				if the prices are competitive as they are on the scurvy screw vendor acc, you will be making so much bank, because the domestic in usa goes for around 100+ for 10 g&#039;s, sell it for a bit less, and u will make plenty of buisness, especially from me :D

				Thanks for all the comments and questions, my friends :)<br /><br />Connoisseur- I understand your concern. We feel the benefits of offering our hash domestically outweighs the risk of being on DEA radar because we have full confidence in our security measures. Also, non-US operations will NEVER be handled in the US. <br /><br />Opium is definetly a possibility, however with it being out of season we won&#039;t be offering it domestically just yet. <br /><br />BlackFedora-we look forward to your business :)<br /><br /><br />Listen, you all know TSC loves you, so you can feel confident our prices will please you :)<br /><br />

All listings will be available from our vendor page. The only thing that will change is under the &quot;shipped from&quot; tab.

				hey guys :) it&#039;s ACE. I&#039;m a bit busy st the mo. But just to chime in quickly re security concerns. we are already on the DEA radar, anyone who moves the amount of product into US soil is. However the choice to move to domestic US is in part based on security. It means less packages moved through US controlls, higher delivery rates and as such chealer prices. less confiscated packages means less evidence for the DEA also noproduct moving though US customs means a dramatic drop in what would appear to be US sales. in reality we will be selling more but there would be no packages moving internstional. <br /><br />on the securty of two people using the same account. I fail to see the login location being a security rist. my teams usse encrypted vm&#039;s removed after each session and stored securely.&nbsp; <br />ace
