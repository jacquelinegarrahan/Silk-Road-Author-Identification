				I lost my damned weed grinder that I was given years back. Am I able to order one online?<br /><br />Also I just heard a thing called a rolling machine exists. Are they any good? I&#039;ve never been the best at rolling joints. Can i get those online too?

				There&#039;s a grinder for sale on SR that I noticed awhile back... the link is below... I&#039;ve seen more expensive ones online from non-SR sellers, too...<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/bdd9b38fa5<br /><br />You should be able to get a rolling machine from your local tobacco smoke shop... lots of people use them to roll their cigarettes (among other things)&nbsp; :)

				I guess it depends on the laws in your country, but I have no problem buying them online. Just search for &#039;head shop&#039;. I&#039;ve never used a rolling machine before I&#039;ve always just rolled them by hand so I can&#039;t comment on them.

				rolling machines take a bit of getting used to as well, before i could skin up properly i think i used one twice and the joints both turned out so tight you couldn&#039;t get a decent pull off them. so i thought fuck it, went through the stage of smoking elephant tampons which forced me to get good at skinning up. now i can do a 7 skin, perfectly coned with barely a crease in the paper 8)<br /><br />i&#039;d recommend going for a metal grinder with a pollen collector at the bottom, then when you run out of weed you&#039;ve still got a few joints left :) and the pollen it collects fucking blows your head off. something like this - http://www.shivaheadshop.co.uk/shop/grinders/cnc_aluminium_crystal_catchers/products/cnc_aluminium_crystal_catchers_-_small.html

				I can roll by hand but I still use my little &#039;rolling machine&#039;, it&#039;s the cheapplastic kind. I get perfect joints from them every time. Most important part is grinding your weed, people who use a grinder often grind it up way too much and it&#039;ll roll too packed and you won&#039;t be able to hit it. Those that break it up by hand often don&#039;t break it up enough and get a chunky smokeable joint, but it doesn&#039;t stay lit properly. So you have to find that middle ground.<br /><br />Then, with the roller open, you dump it in, close it and roll it a few times to get any excess out. You want the roller facing in a direction where you pull the bottom roller towards you with your thumbs. Then you lightly lick the strip on your paper, put the non-licked side into the crease of the roller with the licked portion facing you, and pull the bottom roller again towards you with your thumbs several times.<br /><br />For a grinder, it depends on how much you want to spend. A space case is awsome and with multiple chambers you get way better consistency and can choose how much you want it ground up. I like mine just barely ground up, some people who use smaller pipes want it ground up quite a bit.<br /><br />The cheap metal ones they sell in gas stations, I&#039;ve heard of people who push down really hard to grind on these and metal flakes end up in the weed. Not from the grinding spikes but from the edges of the grinder itself. The titanium grinders and such you won&#039;t have to worry about that. They also make wooden grinders, never tried one but I like the idea of it.

In the US we have &#039;Cyclones&#039; that are basically flavored wraps that are already cone shaped with a plastic mouth piece, so all you have to do is dump your weed in it and pack it, plus you can smoke it all the way down so you don&#039;t end up with the disgusting resin mouth piece at the end. I used to get them when we went out drinking, as it&#039;s far easier and quicker to pack one, and if you have too many heads on it then there&#039;s always that person that thinks the mouth piece is a clit or something and licks the fuck out of it.

For bowls I either use my fingers or trimming scissors if it&#039;s some sticky.
