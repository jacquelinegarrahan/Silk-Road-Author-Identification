				So I found this site on the hidden wiki a week or two ago:<br /><br />http://i3rg5diydpbxkewu.onion/<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to visit that link, it&#039;s a site that has an interface to order counterfeited American $100, $50, or $20 bills. Here&#039;s the text straight from the site.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Quality Counterfeits<br /><br />The best way to cash out your bitcoins!<br /><br />We make high quality counterfeit bills. Why get $15 for your coins when you can get $100? Our bills are made using the washed $5 method and printed using high quality ink from Russia. They pass the pen, watermark, and security strip tests. We have successfully passed these bills at various retailers, but our production greatly exceeds our abilty to spend them without suspicion.<br /><br />When passing the bills, have several real ones on you as well, that way if you get caught it looks like you were the victim of someone else. And never carry more than one fake. Most people will not call the pigs if you immediately pay with a real bill, and often even give you back the fake. We highly suggest shipping to a drop and not your real address.<br /><br />Because of popular demand, we have now begun producing $50s and $20s.<br /><br />Current price is 3 BTC per $100 bill, 2.25 BTC per $50 bill and 1.5 BTC per $20 bill, plus 1 BTC USA shipping or 2 BTC International.<br /><br />Include any questions or comments under your address.<br /><br />Submit an order for 0 to send a message, include your email if you expect a response.<br /><br />All messages remain on our secure server, however there have been many requests for our PGP key. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Has anyone tried/verified this in any way?<br />I sent them a message a week or so ago asking if they could provide pictures of their bills, and they haven&#039;t responded in any way. Just wondering if this is an absolute scam, and if not, whether the bills are passable or not.<br />Thanks

				I think it&#039;s kinda shitty. You&#039;re exploiting your own economy. You have a grandmother that lives in the US? Because you&#039;d literally be stealing from her.

				You are being offered fake-money for bitcoins. And who goes to jail when someone gets caught? Certainly not the counterfeiters. But, more than ANYTHING ELSE...<br /><br />You are being offered fake-money for bitcoins. Fake-money, being fake, has no real value. Some can argue the same is true of bitcoins, of course. But still, the result is that you would be &quot;paying&quot; for nothing. (Also, those shipping costs. That is fucking retarded. That shit can go with a $0.45 stamp.)

				I was given a counterfeit $10 as change once, but it was the absolutely worst counterfeit i&#039;ve ever seen.<br /><br />They did in their defense have all the watermarks, ink, paper, UV spots down, but .... the edge of the bank note was WHITE, as in it had been incorrectly cut from the sheet !<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know it was counterfeit until I went to use it, but most retailers aren&#039;t going to call the cops on you, in fact we joked for a while on how terrible it was.&nbsp; I did of course pay them with REAL money, so perhaps that&#039;s why they didn&#039;t call the cops.<br /><br />But this site looks shady, keeping my 10 foot pole handy.

				I may give a few of these a go. Sent to a PO box under an assumed name, of course. There used to be a guy on SR that was knocking off c-notes for $40, they looked pretty legit. SR Staff pulled his listings down. <br /><br />The only place i&#039;d use these things is where there&#039;s a high chance the other dude is fucking me as well, such as street deals, strip clubs, etc. Or maybe out of country visits...I&#039;m sure a few fake c-notes could get me some nice script pharms south of the border. And down there, what&#039;s the difference? It&#039;s not inflating our economy....as long as those beaners think it&#039;s real cash, it IS real cash, lol.

That&#039;s why I was wondering if anyone had tried it before, and could say if it was a scam or something of the like. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a GBP option elsewhere, I honestly just found this off the Hidden Wiki, however considering how much higher the demand for USD would be, I expect that anyone with the resources to forge bills at any respectable level would forge USD.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40157.msg445776#msg445776">Quote from: fartsinthewind on September 02, 2012, 09:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I may give a few of these a go.

Also, it is inflating our economy, more bills=more inflation, especially if those beaners think it&#039;s real cash.

The colors were all right but it was printed on obviously wrong paper, not the washed $5s. After trying to spend it unknowingly, I went to the bank and they exchanged it for a real 100, I didn&#039;t think they were allowed to do that. Didn&#039;t get questioned or anything, I wondered if the gov&#039;t replaces them or the bank loses money.
