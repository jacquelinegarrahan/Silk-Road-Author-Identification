				So long-story-short, I&#039;ve lost my drivers license for a couple of months.<br /><br />I&#039;ve nothing to do besides work, have the constant disturbance of family members so that kicks reading books out of the window, and dicks on dicks on dicks on cats. I&#039;m so infuriated that I can&#039;t even think straight. Help me reach clarity brothers&nbsp; &nbsp;:(

				1: Hit the gym, get your diet in check. Bulk/cut depending on your body. Nothing beats looking good and high self esteem<br /><br />2: Search out small personal business ventures. Do what you want to do and make money with it. <br /><br />3: Drugs? But don&#039;t delve into massive binges of copious amounts of drugs. Becoming a human vacuum cleaner isn&#039;t good. Use the money you save on gas to get new things to experiment with.

				I second the motion of going to the gym and eating clean and looking good.&nbsp; Nothing feels better than walking in a mall or store knowing chics are looking at you.<br /><br />Video Games<br /><br />Pick your self out an instrument to learn.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like guitar or keyboard. Pick 2 of your favorite guitar solos or&nbsp; intros and&nbsp; &nbsp;try and learn them.<br /><br />If you&nbsp; believe in a god pray for&nbsp; others first and then for your self and give thanks for all you have even if it sucks at the moment it could be worse.&nbsp; my current living situation sucks too.<br /><br />and&nbsp; god yes&nbsp; keep your drug habit in check my friend. Take it from someone&nbsp; who has been there. It will sneak up on you and steal your soul and all you&nbsp; have&nbsp; if you are not careful. Opiates especially.&nbsp; Well for some.&nbsp; Some people have control&nbsp; others like my self have a very addictive personality. So when it gets to where you are pawning your warez and waking up every day&nbsp; wondering when and where you will get your not fix. well thanks to SR the where part is&nbsp; alleviated but you get&nbsp; my drift&nbsp; then that is the start&nbsp; of the downhill slide.<br /><br />Find an interest and educate yourself on it.&nbsp; Improving the mind as well as the body is&nbsp; a good thing&nbsp; cause the mind can get sick same as the body can if you do not take care of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;.

				Want my real opinion? Buy a cookbook and invite a girl over, try making something new together every night until you&#039;ve gone through the entire book. Buy a mountain bike and explore nearby trails. Buy some pre-2000 Lego&#039;s and go crazy with them! Buy the board game Balderdash and invite some close friends over to play it while tripping. Learn how to play in instrument. Take some online classes and learn something you&#039;ve always been curious about. Better yet go to the park and drink with homeless people, you can learn a lot that way and they&#039;ll appreciate it. ;D

				- learn another language (can be an actual spoken language like Spanish or French, a constructed language like Esperanto (that one is easy and fun to learn) or a computer programming language like C )<br />- work out (or a sport like swimming, running, etc)<br />- find a hobby (gardening, lock picking, (ice) skating, cooking, electronics, building models, collecting things) <br />- travel around using other means (bike, bus, train etc if possible in your area)
