				Tie. Done lsd 7 or 8 times, mushrooms just 3. The lsd always had a stronger body load, stronger visuals, and longer lasting. The shroom visuals dont seem to last long, but the experience seemed to be a little more spiritual and I prefer the more comfortable body load. <br />So they even out... The only thing that makes me kind of prefer lsd is that it lasts long enough to really soak in the expierence, whereas with mushrooms its like &quot;whered all the magic go, all of a sudden I cant see it anymore?&quot;

				Dude. Yeah. I love LSD and to be honest, with mushrooms, that&#039;s what I was kind of afraid of. I really like to have time to delve into the experience and not feel like it&#039;s just gone all the sudden. That&#039;d kind of ruin it for me e.e. Thanks for the insight man.

				It really depends on several factors. For me, first is the day of the week. If I were wanting to trip today, it would be LSD. If the trip urge hits me on Wednesday afternoon, then it is shrooms for the obvious time constraints. There are also different experiences I might be looking for. If I am having some emotional issues I am dealing with, then shrooms seem to be the answer for me. If there are complex non emotional issues I am working out, then it is LSD all the way. If I want to wander around in the woods, then the only choice is LSD, but if I am going to be trapped indoors, then I&#039;ll take shrooms. These are not the only two options though, so don&#039;t focus all your energy on choosing between them. Silk Road has plenty of variety and the experiences are wildly different.<br /><br />But my advice for the moment is the shrooms for the simple reason that you haven&#039;t had them yet. You can&#039;t make an informed decision on which is best for you until you have tried them both :)

				And to the duration points that have been made, I suggest 4-Aco-DMT. <br /><br />When I take shrooms, it seems as though the come up is extended and the come down sort of drops off, causing me the same &quot;lost magic&quot; feeling, but 4-aco trips are very similar to shrooms with almost the exact opposite effect. I seem to rocket to peak and float down for a smooth landing.

				I really enjoy the responses ^_^. I&#039;ve felt a really strong emotional and spiritual beauty within my experiences of LSD. Could mushrooms actually be more intense than those? Whenever I was on LSD it was seriously just constant bliss, laughter and contentment with great visuals. Felt like the world was absolutely perfect and beautiful and complete submersion of love for everything. These were amazing revelations I&#039;ll never forget. :)

				LSD. I just can&#039;t enjoy mushrooms anymore, and I can get them anytime I want and I still would much rather wait to get some good LSD than the shrooms. Just personal preference but I just don&#039;t enjoy the body load that shrooms have, never really have but after trying LSD and experiencing a better feeling throughout my body it made me realize just how much I don&#039;t like shrooms for psychedelic trips. Not to mention the duration, I love that one tab can keep you in it&#039;s world for about 12 hours without re-dosing opposed to how long one dose of shrooms will keep you tripping which for me always varied depending on how I decided to consume them.

				MDMA/MDA and/or 2C-b&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But I greatly prefer LSD over Mushrooms. Haven&#039;t touched Mushrooms in years. I like 4-aco-det though.

				I&#039;m tempted to say &quot;mixed&quot;.<br /><br />For me, shrooms give me a serious body load (head drooping like a zombie, almost drooling sometimes) and they make me want to dance or at least shamble rhythmically. Also, I notice that shrooms have more of a confusion factor that can be fun. On high doses I&#039;ve found my self curled up dry heaving mumbling the same nonsensical phrase for hours (not a bad trip but a cherished memory), which would never happen to me on L (most I&#039;ve done is 1000 mics)<br /><br />LSD, on the other hand, is more visual and less mindfucky with no body effects except the vascular constriction. On REALLY high doses things might feel intense and I might breath heavy or feel a sense of energy flowing, but this is uncommon.<br /><br />As I live in a locked down conservative country with strict laws and don&#039;t have the balls to order shrooms, my experience is relatively limited (I went through 100 tabs of L in the last 6 months (about 20 trips), but only had a dose of shrooms that really did it for me maybe 5 times.<br /><br />So what I prefer is to take some syrian rue tea before a mild dose (2-3g) of shrooms (since they&#039;re relatively precious in terms of availability to me), which mitigates the nausea of a higher dose, and then maybe 300 mics of L right after they&#039;re down the hatch.<br /><br />This makes me want to dance or at least nod my head to music, while the LSD provides the crazy CEV music video.<br /><br />And I can hang out in a well lit room where L has a chance to shine for a few minutes, then go into a really dark room where the shrooms make everything cloudy and gray-scale around me.<br /><br />Mixing really has become the way to go for me, unless I&#039;m in public. I would never shroom in public due to the physical signs I&#039;d give off.<br /><br />Speaking of public, I&#039;ve become such an acid head (I never tried any drugs until a year ago, unfortunately&nbsp; late in my life (late 20s)), that I plan events around my tolerance levels. So far my greatest accomplishments while tripping are a day of roller coasters and skydiving.<br /><br />But if I had to pick one, in a country where they are both easily available to me, I&#039;d have to say LSD by a hair.

				I think everyone should try LSD once in their lives.However, I personally prefer mushrooms simply because I am not always in the deep prolonged mental experience LSD offers.I can eat 1.5g of mushrooms and chill out watch&nbsp; movie, get weird, good times.

				Personally I don&#039;t really think you should compare these two substances too much. Although they are frequently associated with one another, they both have interesting things to offer and are actually very different. As similar as they are in someways, they are sort of on an opposite end of the same spectrum from one another. <br /><br />Experiment with them both. There is much to be found.

				This is a classic apples/oranges question.<br /><br />Mushrooms - A real great time with a possible chance to be possessed by evil spirits, have OBO&#039;s, time travel, cry profusely and be reborn.<br /><br />LSD -&nbsp; A real great time with a possible chance to become extremely untrusting of electronics and ultimately destroy them, trying to cut your penis off with a hot knife because it&#039;s an extension of sin and lastly, but certainly not the least, to have a new-found belief in the gentle, sweet lord above, Baby Jesus. <br /><br />I prefer LSD,<br />Kenny &#039;Preach Hard&#039; Powders

				I prefer LSD, just because I think the come-up is alot nicer. I tend to find the sudden onset of shrooms a bit annoying, whereas on acid it almost washes over me if that makes sense lol

				I extremely hard to decide between the two, I get different types of satisfaction from both drugs. I can reach deep, introspective levels with LSD that I just can&#039;t get with mushrooms. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I can use LSD in a group setting and laugh my ass off but I know deep down I can work through some serious mental shit on LSD which leads to some serious revelations. With mushrooms it&#039;s laughs, laughs, laughs all the way, I just can&#039;t get serious on mushrooms at all. I&#039;ve tried the introspective trip with psilocybin and I just can&#039;t do it, believe me, I&#039;ve tried. On reflection, I would have to say I prefer LSD as it can cover all my needs. I can trip alone and expand my mind or I can trip with friends and have a damn good time. I&#039;m not saying mushrooms don&#039;t have their place as teachers but for me, LSD takes me places mushrooms just can&#039;t. I fucking love mushrooms though so preferably I&#039;d like both in my stash :-)
