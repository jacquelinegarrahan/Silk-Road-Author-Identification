				Now it can be told.<br /><br />Not that you didn&#039;t know right from the beginning, but those tiresome &#039;progressives&#039; have screeched for so long &quot;a court acquitted him, so he&#039;s innocent!&quot; that more-trusting young minds might conceivably believe that load of okeydoke.<br /><br />But never doubt it for a minute....if it walks, talks and quacks like a duck with a putty nose, and it sleeps with ten-year-old boys besides? It&#039;s a fag. The worst kind, too - a weird fag with enough money to insulate it from the law of the land.<br /><br />And if the money were to have run out at some point.....? Then cry &quot;racist&quot; and let slip the Jew lawyers of war!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Michael Jackson &#039;spent $35 million to silence at least two dozen boys he abused&#039; according to secret explosive FBI files<br />By DAILY MAIL REPORTER<br /><br />Michael Jackson paid $35 million in hush money to at least two dozen young boys he sexually abused over 15 years, it has been alleged.<br /><br />Sunday People has published explosive ‘secret FBI files’ suggesting the King of Pop groomed and molested children from at least 1989, despite his insistence he was just spending time with them.<br /><br />The damning files claim the deceased popstar was a &#039;pedophile&#039; who watched porn while assaulting a boy, molested a famous child star, fondled a child’s genitals in his private cinema and groped another child whose mother wasn’t ‘bothered’ by it.<br /><br />The FBI did not return Mail Online’s calls today.<br /><br />Jackson family lawyers have to date insisted the star has only paid off the family of Jordan Chandler, 13, who he allegedly abused in 1993.<br /><br />However a sleuth hired by Anthony Pellicano – a celebrity private eye Jackson allegedly hired to make the pedophilia claims go away – has claimed Jackson was a ‘serial child predator’ who paid out scores of children he allegedly abused at his Neverland Ranch.<br /><br />Sunday People says it has evidence to back the investigators claims.<br />When Anthony Pellicano was investigated in 2002 for bugging Hollywood stars, the FBI seized his files, including many about Jackson.<br /><br />These included case files CADCE MJ-02463 and CR 01046 which Sunday People claims it has access to.<br /><br />The files were allegedly not passed on to prosecutors in Jackson’s controversial 2005 molestation trial.<br /><br />The shocking revelations come after Jacko’s daughter, 15-year-old Paris, recently tried to kill herself by slashing her wrists.<br /><br />In further scandal, his family is also trying to sue gig promoter AEG Live who they claim hired Dr Conrad Murray who prescribed Jackson his last fatal drug dose.<br /><br />AEG Live denies hiring Murray, who is currently serving a four-year jail term for involuntary manslaughter. The investigator, who spoke to Sunday People on the condition of anonymity, said he decided to finally come forward after Jackson’s former child friend Wade Robson revealed he was abused by Jackson.<br /><br />Australian-born Robson, a dancer and choreographer, recently launched a major lawsuit against the Jackson estate, saying he was regularly molested at Neverland in the 1990s. Sunday People claims it has seen files confirming Robson’s claims.<br /><br />While Pellicano is now in jail for racketeering and wire-tapping, his investigator told Sunday People he was hired to help dig the dirt on Jackson and make potential problems disappear. He claims Jackson was obsessed with child porn and preyed on the sons of friends.<br /><br />The investigator said he kept copies of FBI documents naming 17 boys - including five child actors and two dancers – Jacko targeted for abuse.<br />These included a European boy and the sons of a screenwriter. The sleuth said at least three boys were paid to stay silent, with the family of a famous film actor given about $596,300 not to talk to the media.<br /><br />He said a Neverland maid was allegedly paid $2 million after accusing her boss of molesting her son, while another woman who knew her son was being assaulted ‘turned a blind eye to it because if it didn’t bother him, it didn’t bother her’.<br /><br />The files on the alleged victims were reportedly compiled when lawyers drew up a list of ‘potential threats’ to Jackson’s image in the early 1990s, when he was on a world tour. But after the father of Jordan Chandler publicly claimed his son had been abused, other similar accusations began flooding the media.<br />Chandler was paid a hefty sum to stay out of the limelight.<br /><br />‘His [Jackson’s] actress friend Elizabeth Taylor encouraged him to hire Pellicano ▲because she had used him to stop dirt on her drug problems being released in the media,’ the investigator, who spent two years on the case, alleged. &#039;Pellicano had links to key figures in the US media and made them dance to his tune. With the help of people like Pellicano, the world and his fans never heard what took place at Neverland over 15 years.’<br /><br />While Jackson was found not guilty of abusing a 13-year-old boy in 2005, the private eye insists the boxes of evidence he helped to collect showed ‘Jackson was a serial child predator’.<br /><br />The investigator said he didn’t come forward to upset Jackson’s children, but to finally make public that authorities have shocking information on the dead star that has never been released.<br /><br />However long-time Jackson lawyer and friend Brian Oxman said he thought only Chandler had been paid off, but admitted the ‘gift list on Michael’s income tax returns was astounding’.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				At no point did Jackson or his hangers-on ever deny that he, repeatedly and obsessively, slept in the same bed with small prepubescent boys. The fact that he turned his house into the kind of three-ring circus and petting zoo designed to attract and delight small children would - if he were a white businessman who earned his money in widget-manufacturing - have been one more damning piece of evidence in what would surely have been a quick and clean trial ending in a unanimous guilty verdict.<br /><br />Forget the small procedural details......he slept with little boys. Again and again and again and again and again!<br /><br />Anybody with the slightest scintilla of common sense knew this was true for well near two decades at least; no after-the-fact smoking gun required.....not when a man in his 40s is hosting sleepovers for 9-year-olds. Look, I agree that pedo-mania is at an unhealthy all-time high, and I&#039;m painfully aware that such charges can come in VERY handy for a corrupt and omnipotent state bent on crushing dissent altogether. But bonafide kid-touchers genuinely belong in places like Gitmo, and &quot;people&quot; like Lynndie England.<br /><br />Ordinarily, the level of proof needed to - at the very least - slap him with an order to keep away from kids is less than that needed to convict a murderer or bank robber, but that&#039;s okay, because little kids can&#039;t protect themselves.

				I never understood the popularity of this guy anyway. I can only think of three hits that were significant, two of which he didn&#039;t even wrote himself. Back in their heydays, The Beatles could fill entire albums of chart smashing pop hits, but this guy is supposedly even bigger then they were. I guess its one of those Elvis Presley things, more image then substance with the added caveat of rising in popularity during the era of peak white guilt.

				If you are wondering how talented MJ was, keep in mind Quincey Jones played a crucial role in the really good records, and zero role in subsequent not good records.<br /><br />I have no doubt that the richest global elite run ritual child abuse rituals.&nbsp; This probably happens currently and has likely happened for centuries.&nbsp; MJ was likely involved at some level, and maybe heavily involved.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is a major bummer to to spend time researching this stuff.<br /><br />Most people who like drugs enough to be on these forums probably understand &amp; respect mind control tactics.&nbsp; Just envision mind control from a controlled ritual abuse perspective with unlimited resources.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or just call me nuts!&nbsp;
