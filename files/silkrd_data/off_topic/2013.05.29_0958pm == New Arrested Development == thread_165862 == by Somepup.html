				Has anyone watched the new 4th series yet on Netflix? <br /><br />It was great to see them back. Obviously they had hectic filming schedules so they had to film each characters storyline individually but it was still smartly done with each story interweaving.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m about halfway through season 4. Netflix did a really good job on production.<br /><br />side note: What is up with Portia de Rossi&#039;s face? Her character barely makes any facial expressions now. Too much botox and/or surgery.<br /><br />sdesu

				was super disappointed by the first episode, felt a little better seeing the second, and now that i&#039;m about 3/4 of the way through i&#039;m dying laughing every episode.&nbsp; the whole thing between gob and tony wonder being gay is the funniest fucking thing i&#039;ve ever seen in my life, had me tearing up, laughing so hard it makes my hernia hurt.<br /><br />IM HERE, IM QUEER, AND NOW IM OVER HERE

				Yeah, I think the first few episodes were a little rough.&nbsp; After you get through those, it gets a hell of a lot better.&nbsp; Gob&#039;s episode was my favorite also.&nbsp; The ending was a bit disappointing though.&nbsp;

She looked just fucking amazing before and I don&#039;t think the difference is age. Someone on the net is bound to do side-by-side comparisons if they haven&#039;t already.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t think much of season 4 to start but once it got going I loved it. Didn&#039;t stick with the same old, didn&#039;t phone it in. Still experimental, risky, interesting. And after this much time, too. Best comeback ever.
