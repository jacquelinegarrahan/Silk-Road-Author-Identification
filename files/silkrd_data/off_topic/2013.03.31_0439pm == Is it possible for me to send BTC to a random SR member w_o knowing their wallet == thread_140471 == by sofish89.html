				I was .01 BTC short of an order so I thought fuck it I&#039;ll just post in the spare change thread and see what happens. I didnt post any wallet # info, all i wrote was that i was really annoyed that I was less than a .01 BTC short and i was asking if it was possible to transfer less than a .01 btc (bec of the decimals).<br />I didn&#039;t expect anything, I was asking more for the info of how the decimals work such as .001 btc since it only shows 2 places.<br />Lo and behold I logged on the next time and it showed a deposit of .01 BTC into my account! Did someone donate that to me Is that even possible to do without having my wallet info?

				Yeah you can send directly to your username, I was going to send my .01 over to you but I had literally just given it away a minute earlier! I&#039;m glad someone helped you out, I think that&#039;s where I&#039;ll head with my leftovers next time.
