				Fair play Limitless, your a fuckin head case lol.<br /><br />I think spliff making should be in there, judged on :-<br /><br />1, Speed (how long it takes to make a spliff and light it)<br />2, Technical difficulty (how many papers long, is it a conical)<br />3, Looks (is it a pretty spliff)<br />4, Taste (does it smoke like a dream)<br />5, The Burn (does it burn correctly, evenly and not have smoldering bit falling out of the end)<br /><br />I think its a damn good idea, and iv got the judging criteria sorted. Anyone got an e-mail adddy for thr olympic committee ??? <br /><br />oh. i almost forgot, the winter olympics can have the event of snowcraft :) think of all the things you can do with a bit of snow :D<br /><br />

				I also think Cocaine Hurdles should be on there too. That isn&#039;t just an Olympic Sport though, that&#039;s your average Friday night. <br /><br />You play by going into a bar and doing 1 line of coke in the toilet and then a shot in the bar, second bar 2 lines and 2 shots, 3rd bar 3 lines and 3 shots and so on. <br /><br />The winner is the one to either get into a fight first or not pass out.

				I think that alcohol would make the Olympics more watchable<br /><br />Give hurdlers a liter of vodka 15 mins before the race.<br /><br />Also, I think we ought to have a cannabis trimming event. <br /><br />And for the pervs out there, water sports.<br /><br />I think LSD synchronized swimming would be a hoot.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />And topless womens events.<br /><br />Sexist perhaps, but would provide some interest one would surmise!<br /><br />Dick jousting for the ladies maybe.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />(waits for more neg!)
