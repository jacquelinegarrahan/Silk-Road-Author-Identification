				It looks like the vendor DUDUS http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cf37633d4c (Who is clearly new to SR) has been selling Methylone as MDMA. I unfortunately did not test it because it looked relatively pure and came in large crystals. I saw a comment on his page from someone who purchased an Oz of the stuff and did a reagent test. Thinking back, the crystals did look a lot like either bk-mdma or methylone. <br /><br />Shitty part is, Ive already sold some to my buddy and he has already taken it. I have no idea what methylone does, Ive been frantically searching this shit up on Erowid now to try and learn everything about it. Do I have any cause for concern? He was taking 110mg tonight<br /><br />And of course I already fucking FE&#039;d for this dipshit. If only I had of waited a few more days.

				Methylone and bk-MDMA are the same thing.&nbsp; It&#039;s like saying weed, pot, grass or cannabis.&nbsp; Methylone does the same thing as MDMA but requires twice the amount.&nbsp; It is speedier and the roll does not last as long.&nbsp; No cause for concern.&nbsp; 110mg will be rather weak.

				I was in contact with him trying to get a sample as he states clearly that he offers free samples of &quot;mdma&quot; and I told him I was going to test it with marquis etc, he stopped responding and that got me paranoid, knew that deal had to be too good to be true i mean 7g for 180 bucks... Feel bad for all the people that ordered from him and hope he gets his vendor account banned, broke the sacred rule of SR imo of improper advertisement. Seems humboltgreengarden is gone now, I hope for the same reason because I remember hearing him scamming the same way. Either way good riddance to people that lie about product...

				I asked the vendor for a sample, and he said sure, I&#039;ll make a custom order in a second. Right as he gave me the custom order I responded &quot;Thanks I&#039;ll marquis it for you!&quot; and he pulled the custom and stopped responding to me. :\

				Yeah the price was a red flag to me, but when I said i&#039;d marquis it and probably be a big customer if it tested well he stopped responding. Sufficient to say after that guy posted his negative results on marquis I sent a rant telling him to fuck off basically. I hate asswipes who do this, and he makes people FE or spend a crazy amount to stay in escrow so most of the buyers get screwed. Either way I hope you get a refund and this guy gets his vendor account revoked...

				I knew the market values for MDMA, I just thought it was a miracle or something. This shit is weird, my buddy actually liked it but I can definitely tell its not M. The guy was dying for more after 110mg, he never does that shit with classic molly.<br /><br />Glad I didn&#039;t touch it, I probably wont either. I ordered M, not fucking M1.<br /><br />Should I be reporting this guy via customer support? Or what should I be doing

I have seen alot of people on the street trying to <br />pass it off as mdma but didnt think it was happening on here too! Yes it is similar in some respects to mdma<br />To me it seems more coke like-stimulant than mdma and it is a very moorish chem as well. always leaves <br />you wanting more! most girls love it! gets em real horny!

				That is pretty terrible. If it&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned from here it&#039;s that the forums are a really integral part of SR. They need to indulge more! I hope they see this. +1 for the author.

				Well said&nbsp; tessellated :), I actually might be coming by your shop to get some molly soon, I ordered via another vendor that is legit, but you seem to have the top quality shit. I probably wouldnt be able to order a whole 5 tho, gonna have to wait til you can do lower listings or a custom maybe :) in a couple weeks likely

				Yah the fucker isnt returning my messages now either. The Methylone I got sent the second time was fucking pink too, no way in hell I&#039;m even selling this now. I took the other batch I had and did a 99% ISO wash and now I have a white, crystally fluff. So I guess its better then pink shards, but still. Its not fucking MDMA like I ordered.<br /><br />Read this from the bottom up (Theres been no reply after my last message, despite him reading it.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Internal Freedom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#039;s entirely up to you, you&#039;re the one shipping the wrong weight &amp; product. A refund would be a first step, but of course thats not going to repair your reputation with me or the guy who ordered an Oz off of you.<br /><br />dudus(87) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how do you want to resolve this<br /><br />Internal Freedom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey man, so the order arrived today, but we have a few problems.<br /><br />First of all, you sent me Methylone, just like the last order. Which I don&#039;t appreciate considering the listing was for MDMA. You also stated you would throw in that extra 0.3, when in reality, the new order only weighed out to 1.083 (not 1.3). You didn&#039;t even give me an extra point... I like to order off new vendors to help them make a name for themselves, but using untrustworthy business practices on SR is not the way to make or keep customers. I imagine you&#039;re making a lot of money selling Methylone as MDMA but its not right, at all. I had to go out of my way to find a reagent test just to test this stuff because I was so unsure about it. I am not fond of RCs nor do I intend to put them in my body, so this purchase has been a complete waste for me. Please message me back with a resolution. I have further edited my feedback until this has been resolved.<br /><br />Internal Freedom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be appreciated, ill throw another order in this weekend. Thanks<br /><br />dudus(87) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i will hook you up fat next time unless you really want me to ship an extra .3 ...<br /><br />Internal Freedom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey man, I got your letter in the mail yesterday. I&#039;m sure it was just an accident or a small problem on your end, but you gave me 0.755 of MDMA instead of the 1g that I ordered. I weighed everything out and made sure there was none left sticking on the sides, it was still 0.755 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />dudus(87) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorry you don&#039;t need to fe it ships tomorrow got confused<br /><br />dudus(87) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;please FE so i can ship thanks
