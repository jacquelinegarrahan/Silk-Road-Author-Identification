				I want some feedback on what you think is a realistic expectation of a completed transaction, from physical cash in your hand to physical dope in the mailbox.<br /><br />I had thought two weeks for my first purchase, as I was willing to pay top BTC for express shipping, but sadly I was grossly optimistic - a week later and I have not even been able to get enough BTC (never should&#039;ve hedged my orders between 2 MPs...).<br /><br />Break it down if you want (time to get BTC, time to purchase, time to delivery).&nbsp; Of course for some people this varies, they want to watch the market for a few days, or they only check their account every few days... these things add delays.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-CT

				I guess that comes with experience... I was making 2 purchases and I split everything (including the MPs) because I was totally new.&nbsp; One order is set to arrive tomorrow (5 days from cash-in-hand) and the other is still sitting on a moneypak that I can not get exchanged for my life.

				I am typically working with 1 week.&nbsp; A day to get coins and get them into SR to order. Normally a day to process and get out to shipping, and around 4 days max to receive shipment (i only choose priority)

				Between 4-15 business days I&#039;m thinking. <br /><br />2-3 days to exchange money from your bank in to bitcoins and get it on your SR account and the rest for delivery depending on the location and speed of your vendor?

				CT, if you want to exchange a MP for Bitcoin try BTCpal on SR... he&#039;s done small amounts for me in the past (some BTC vendors have a $100 min)... his profile link on SR is below... send him a PM, and good luck.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5749116fcf

				The majority of my packages have arrived within a week, but I&#039;ve had free packages take around a month to arrive which doesn&#039;t bother me at all. It&#039;s never concerned me too much, as I know most of the time it&#039;s really up to the postal service, so I don&#039;t mind as long as I get it eventually.

All depends on who you&#039;re dealing with and the supply in your area. To answer shortly, no. Just read ratings of the product and check the forums to get an idea of how long it would take for you to receive. Possibly even message the seller.<br />
