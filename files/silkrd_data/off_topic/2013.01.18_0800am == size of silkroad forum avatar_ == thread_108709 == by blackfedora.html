				It&#039;s usually 100 x 100 pixels. But when I tried to upload an avatar of that size it said it was too big, but an avatar with 48 x 48 pixels worked. So I think It has to be smaller than 100 x 100 pixels.<br /><br />Robin.

				I went down to 45 pixels, and still it wont accept it. Sorry I ever tried to change it. This whole system has been glitchy lately. <br /><br />Oh well!<br /><br />Not the most important thing in the world.

				I agree. Something&#039;s hosed. I tried to replace my avatar with a different one. Says picture is too big or it&#039;s not an avatar. Tried to upload the old one I was using. No dice.<br /><br />Can someone look into this?

				I just read where nomad said that he discovered info that an avatar will upload if the longest side is a max of 64 pixels.<br />I guess it&#039;s possible he never tried 65 and went with the info he got that worked but he does have a new avatar.

				yeah i just switched to 64x64 per this thread in the technical support forum:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107156.0<br /><br />that&#039;s working, so it seems like somewhere in the 60-65 pixel range per side is the sweet spot

				The upgrade doesnt have the auto resize function so the 65 x 65 pixels is the new size to get an avatar to upload.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad
