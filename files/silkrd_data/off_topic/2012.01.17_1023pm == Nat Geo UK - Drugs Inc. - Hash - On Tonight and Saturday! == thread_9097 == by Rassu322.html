				Hey guys, thought some of you would LOVE this<br /><br />I know I do, especially since the Hash trade in THIS show is talking about Hash available readily on the marketplace, and hash I&#039;ve bought myself. <br /><br />Description:<br />A look into the underworld of hash producers, dealers and users, beginning in the Moroccan Riff mountains, where 800,000 people live on the profits of the drug. The programme also reveals the struggles of customs officers trying to stop the trade in the Strait of Gibraltar, and explores its controversial medicinal uses.<br /><br />I think there are 3 episodes, next week is Crack Cocaine <br /><br />For fellow Brits! its on at 1am tonight (so 1am 18th Jan) on Nat Geo channel 526 on Sky <br /><br />It also repeat on Saturday 21st Jan 10pm Nat Geo

				That was on last week here in the states. I posted elsewhere about the balls you Brits have bringing that in. <br />But, I also think these kinds of shows have very bad aspects to them, especially in the USA. They are used to show how dangerous our world is, and why it needs to be taken down. But if you watch closely, it&#039;s mostly dangerous because of &#039;them&#039;. <br />There was another special on Nat Geo about how herb growers in CA, OR, &amp; WA, mainly illegal immigrants with ties to MexDrgCartel, were polluting our forrests. <br />There are so many sides to the spectrum, but one thing always is the trump card. <br />LEGALIZATION, pure and simple, And not for just medical. <br />Is it the only illegal plant in the world? I can buy lima beans and make ricin. But I can&#039;t grow a few plants to make me happy. <br />FTW!

				Last night was MDMA. Another pathetic attempt at scare tactics. The fucking paramedics scene was TOTALLY bogus (reminders of Moonshiners...which if you didn&#039;t know was not real at all! Those police dept&#039;s ending up suing over the show!) Anyway, some chick drives all the way to Maine from California, JUST to take 100mg of MDMA, and do some stupid hippie bullshit psychotherapy. IMO, they should take the therapy off the word! Pure psycho. Fucking retarded. THEN....they go to a club in Miami, this is the &#039;paramedic scene&#039;, watch closely. Main medic can&#039;t even stop smiling. the dude &#039;having a bad trip&#039; is a horrible actor. <br />IT&#039;S ALL MADE UP! This show is a scare tactic. Pure and simple. <br />

				I&#039;m disappointed in Nat Geo for this series.&nbsp; Scare tactics and misleading information.&nbsp; Over-dramatization.&nbsp; The guy that takes mushrooms for cluster headaches really needs a guide.&nbsp; He goes into it with a horrible mental state and it seemed like the family was even scared.&nbsp; Wrong energies for a mushroom trip.&nbsp; In the hash one (i thnik), they cite a study about the dangerous of cannabis where subjects were given IVs of THC.
