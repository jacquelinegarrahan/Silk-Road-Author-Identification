				Why is it so hard find a girl thats just the right amount of nutty.&nbsp; Like all the girls around now seem to be total fruit baskets. Like no screws in there in the first place. All you get now are irrational fears of radiators and weird emo, goth, wasteofspace hybrids.<br />Before I remember knowing loads of girlies with the best qualities, with whats on offer now Id rather put on mop head on my shop vac and drag that around with me. <br /><br />It´s not hard, you take an averagely good looking girl, cut her hair short, add a cute smile, alternative style of dressing. You shove some intelligence in there, quite a bit of that, but not so much shes so super smart she makes you look like a plank. Make her brave so shes not crying and screaming when like the wheel falls off the car or the dog starts eating the neighbor. Make her know shes got class, but not too much to make her some giant ego zepplin. Splash of naughty, large splash. splash of nice. For like when you´ve broken you leg and your running a fever and you need to be mothered. Caring, considerate, always on the look out to help others. Level head for when your loosing yours and thats it.. <br /><br />See not hard.. girls sharpen up eh, stop acting like tools and screeching every time the blender is switched on. Stop pretending to be scared of squirrels and stop being possessive witchesssssss aight...&nbsp; <br /><br />ACEout

				I have already +1&#039;ed ya, Ace, for another thread, but yeah, I hear ya. Tis true, tis pity, tis pity tis true. Your woeful lament calling for the fairer sex to be more than a noise producing, money consuming, receptacle for jizz should be heard world wide. <br /><br />There are many women who are so hung up on what they think they should be, that they have never embraced what THEY want to be and do. If my wife told me today that she wanted to quit school, learn to juggle midgets while singing &quot;my country tis of thee&quot;, I would first piss myself laughing, and then, if she were serious, I would make sure she could. (run little people, run, cuz what princess wants, princess gets). <br /><br />I admire the strength required not to just spank it in private, and live the solitary life. I have a coupla soul brothers who have gone all spanky spanky after being run through the gamut by their exes. Makes me wipe away a solitary tear for their chapped palms, it does.<br />
