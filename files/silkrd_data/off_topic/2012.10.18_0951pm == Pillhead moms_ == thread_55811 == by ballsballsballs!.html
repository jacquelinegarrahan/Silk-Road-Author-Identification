				I tend to disagree with some of the other posts. I don&#039;t see the harm in a mother taking the odd pill here and there on a night out.<br />One of my friends takes pills about twice or three times a year, but never in the vicinity of her child and it doesn&#039;t impact the child in any way at all.<br /><br />As long as it doesn&#039;t effect the child, I think it is OK.<br /><br />Just my opinion anyway...

				I have found that the real problem is them affording it. I would trust a sitter on a pain pill to watch the children(After a complete brain remapping, as it was unacceptable before-gross), but there are other things that come in to play. Theft, no direction if you are not established in a career. Blah blah, if you can&#039;t pay your bills, you can&#039;t take care of your children. Any drug in recreation is acceptable, but the ones who need it to motivate are harmful I guess.

				Assuming the mother isn&#039;t just taking a pill for recreational use, it is a parenting fault. Most mothers have faults. One or two faults won&#039;t necessarily make the mother incapable of raising children. Substance abuse is never ideal, but a mother who admits she has issues with pills and tries to change it, is better than a mother who denies it and lies. In most cases it is probably better than the alternative foster care, but that depends on how the mother behaves when she has been taking pills. Some people can control themselves and still function, while other loose it completely. It&#039;s obviously better for the children if the mother manages to keep the household running and if there is a father who can step in when she has her worse periods. Being able to successfully raise children is also a gray scale. A lot of children make it out of junky homes and become successful later in life, but in my opinion they should still be considered &quot;unsuccessfully raised.&quot;

				the subject was &quot;pillHEAD moms&quot; ... no i dont think a mom who is a pill head would be a very good mother.&nbsp; I know a large handful or two of mothers who have had their kids taken from them because they are pillHEADs....now someone who isn&#039;t addicted... yeah they can probably provide ...for a while.... but rest assured, you&#039;ll be addicted before long....
