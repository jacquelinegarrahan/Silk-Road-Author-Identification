				Seriously? There&#039;s No one out there from the DEA,NSA, CIA, FBI or NYPD (they seem to think they have jurisdiction over the world)<br />Please explain why such lethal drugs as Alcohol and Tobacco and the thousands of Big Pharma Meds that at least half the countries addicted too, are legal? And Marijuana and LSD which both are proven to have medical benefits are Illegal?.....Not to mention the health care in America is horrible if your low income, and If you do have to go to a clinic they won&#039;t write prescriptions for pain meds&gt; So if your a Hard working part of the working poor in this country and need meds for the physical work that you do your &quot;shit out of luck&quot; There&#039;s a depression going on in the states if you haven&#039;t noticed?<br /><br />Please tell me how its justified that our guns laws are so lax, and the gun lobby&#039;s are so huge, that we allowed thousands of guns to go into Mexico fueling their horrible horrible Drug War......bodies literally piling up in body counts at 50 or more at a time?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And of course Wall-Mart is the biggest retailer of guns in America? <br />Why the fuck don&#039;t you go arrest them?...<br />There&#039;s been at least 18 gun related deaths in the major US city i live in already this year!<br /><br />When will you come over to the side of light? Do you not care about the blood on your hands? Sure you get a pay check? But that kind of blood is hard to wash off:(<br />I&#039;m not a criminal you are!

				I can&#039;t! Its Illegal for me to take&nbsp; the calming medicine i need:( Xanax, Valium whatever) My government doesn&#039;t trust me with them!<br />They would rather throw me away like so many others <br />So i will answer my own question that i posed to them. And then will crawl back into my grave, where its peaceful!<br />Its the Prison Industrial Complex Stupid!!!!!! or as i like to call it...The Obama jobs plan, and Bush before him and Clinton before him....you know the they!<br />Yes we figured out a way of creating a jobs program by throwing away people....mostly of color, but there&#039;s plenty of poor people that don&#039;t have access to lawyers or so called pubic defenders...Yes the deck is certainly stacked against us 99%ers<br />And when we go to jail, its not a country club like Jack Abramoff or Rob Blagojevich! <br />No our prison system is brutal, Rape ,Murder, Torture....<br />Yeah all that shits legal now, wiretapping...no problem! sneak and peak.....sure fucking thing! where do i sign?....lets get &quot;The Bad Guys&quot; Us against them....black&amp;white..no in between.<br /><br />Yet yet America is the biggest exporter of terrorism in the world killing innocent people where ever possible. Over land, Overseas, under the ever watchful eye of the killer drones. We just wiped out and entire family in Afghanistan...Mission accomplished?&nbsp; Hearts and minds? give me a break. <br />Imagine floating down the lets say the Sacramento river and a Honduras helicopter shoots you pregnant wife or daughter and your son in-law or your son. That&#039;s the reality for others of our drug war....calm down! i wish<br />Sometimes I feel like i have awoken to a nightmare<br />Like I said to start, Its all fucked up! the lunatics are running the asylum<br />Good bye!<br />&nbsp;

				Damn I really wish I could just get on some public speaking platform and shout all this shit. There really is no way prohibition makes sense no matter how you look at it. I&#039;ve argued it with so many people even cops, and they just make the same argument &quot;Illegal drugs are bad and we need to save you from yourself&quot;&nbsp; no facts. no reason.

				cast it out of your mind. Don&#039;t even think about the fucked up shit. It just piles up and keeps multiplying if you do. We all create our own circumstance. Only focus and think about the good things in your life. Be thankful for what you got and more reasons to be thankful will come into your life. <br /><br />From birth we are programmed by our environments and the people in our lives. Follow your heart to the beat of a positvie vibe. There&#039;s always gonna be negatives to cross your path. This is the balance. Let the negatives flow in and out of your mind with ease. Focus on the positives. Being thankful is the secret. That is how religions have tricked people into thinking that their way works.&nbsp; Every thought you have is a prayer. Even if it&#039;s bad or good, it attracts more of the same into your life. Giving thanks is what works and you need no deity for it to work. It&#039;s how life works. <br /><br />Being thankful for what you got and dreaming or day dreaming about what you want literally works.&nbsp; <br /><br />So to set and stew over the bad stuff in the world will bring to your attention more bad stuff.<br /><br />To talk about something different, we need less government in America. Of course the DEA and other government agencies are going to do everything they can to keep marijuana and drugs illegal. They get 15 million dollars a year just for the eradication of God&#039;s holy plant. By pushing against something God put here for us they are the causers of more plagues. That 15 million is our tax dollars at work. Not to mention all the tax dollars that go into keeping non violent drug offenders in our jails that are already over full. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to see somebody like Ron Paul get into office and see if he holds true to his promise to legalize and cut government plus all his other promises. Maybe it&#039;ll be Rand Paul since it looks like the majority here wants to vote in a mormon who is a money man because they think it will help the economy. Wrong in my opinion because it&#039;s just another Obama. If I have to chose between Obama and Romney then I am going with Obama. If ron paul is running even if his party doesn&#039;t back him then I will cast my vote for him.<br /><br />There are millions of people who won&#039;t wake up to the fact that we are born free minded. The God that is gave us the ability to think how and what we want and there&#039;s nobody that can control our mind but us. The mind is a miraculous thing. The universe is mental. What are you creating with your mind right now? You are the only one responsible for all your circumstances. Taking responsibility for everything that happened to you and for you is the first step in accepting the power you have with your own mind. It&#039;s really very simple. Don&#039;t think about negative shit and have an attitude of gratitude.<br /><br />Seeing results from this method doesn&#039;t happen overnight. Did you get programmed the way you are overnight? It takes a little time to get your mind trained into thinking with gratitude on a daily basis. Once it becomes effortless then you will start noticing small evidence that it&#039;s true. Took me about a week before it became effortless then the magic of life started happening. Being thankful raises your vibrations to a highe level and let&#039;s the good things that you want into your world.
