				I&#039;m fairly new to bitcoin and have previously used intersango to buy coins.<br />This was perfect for me as no id or anything was required it was a simple cash deposit.<br />However intersango have no switched to metro bank which is only in London (and I am not).<br /><br />I have considered using Ukash but can&#039;t find a reliable place to convert it into bitcoins.<br /><br />Any recommended ways to buy bitcoins?

				I got this same problem opened intersango account and originally got lloyds TSB acc details I could anonymously get bit coins for cash.<br />What alternative have we got in the UK now looked at a couple of sites offering sms text service but 1.5 btc for a Â£10 makes SR the most expensive place anywhere I know to score. God damn pain in the arse dying to get going on there but not throwing my hard earned money away on stupid rates and commissions for bitcoins.<br />Please help peeps

				i havent done it myself yet but mtgox go accept GBP direct bank payments at any barclays bank, not sure on ID, but i think they only want it for withdrawing cash to an account, i think you can buy btc without id, if not then just give them the id they want and be sure to wash your coins well

				Ahhhhh yeaaah does this mean we are good to go with intersango now then? Would love a confirmation from anyone who&#039;s done GBP to BTC via intersango in last month, just to be certain?<br /><br />Having done my homework, it seems like the most attractive option, assuming its trustworthy?<br /><br />CAN&#039;T WAIT to get this hooked up. SR awaits me! Ah what a beautiful new world of opportunity and anonymity. Just need the bitcoins....&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Good to be here.<br />Darkcrash
