				yes i used to hang out with a girl who i suspected had borderline. She was a genius but spent all her time obsessed with getting coke.. What a shame that a brain like hers went to waste. The relationship between me and her did not end well and she was real manipulative and very paranoid.<br />Awhile later I was reading about Borderline personality disorder and was shocked to see alot of similiarities..<br />There&#039;s a movie that came out in the 80&#039;s or 90&#039;s called Fatal Attraction. Its supposed to be about this guy who has an affair with a girl with BPD. <br />Feel free to PM me

				Thanks for the response.<br />It really sucks and took a long time to get this diagnosis. Frequent depressive episodes anxiety and amplified unstable emotions really get too much.<br />There is such negative stigma attached to it, health professionals are very unhelpful and quick to fob you off.<br /><br />If anyone reads this and is suffering or think they need any advice etc please respond

				A lot of people are commenting on ex gf&#039;s having it...<br />It can be problematic for the partner of the bpd but also very painful difficult for the one suffering. Because they don&#039;t mean it..

				Well I&#039;m in a semigood situation. She doesn&#039;t trust anyone, basically hates everyone else, but me. She loves me, but it puts me in a weird position because I know if I ever left her she would go back to trying to kill herself.

				Hmm I wouldn&#039;t say that is a good position.<br />When someone lives only for you and puts all their efforts into you, yeah it can be flattering but It must be an awful burden to carry around. I can relate to her, but not to that extreme. I hope she is getting help. If things were to break down for you two in whatever way it could be potentially awful.<br /><br />She also needs to be able to live for herself and feel okay with that although I admit this can be very difficult.<br />:(

Most of which is misplaced. <br /><br />It is often compared to anti-social personality and optional defiant disorder and considered incurable but neither is accurate. <br /><br />Often if you doctor or therapist feels you are difficult to deal with or just simply doesn&#039;t like you that they will place this table on you. <br /><br />Some one mentioned it was close to bi polar disorder which in a way is kind of accurate. Except bi polar is a chemical imbalance and BPD is more a result of trama, stress, and lack of effective coping skills. <br /><br />It can be treated but most mental health practitioners are stuck in the past on treatment.

				Shitty day today.<br />My girl did something not right to me. I told her I think we should see other people. She than got upset and we kept talking, it turned into a bad fight. Than she pulled a gun and almost killed herself. I had to wrestle her to the ground, take it from her, than tell her that I was sorry, loved her, and would stay with her. I&#039;m stuck here. I don&#039;t know what to do.

				She probs needs to be sectioned. Poor her.<br />And shit for you too..<br /><br />I can be a right knob though when it comes to interpersonal relationships. Push and pull, divide and conquer, but I don&#039;t mean it. I get soooo hurt for little things.<br />They describe it like having an open wound all the time that won&#039;t heal

				It sucks to get hurt easily. I always find myself making my girl feel better about this or that because the littlest things people do hurt her.<br />She loves how basically nothing can hurt me, so she feels I can protect her. Puts a damn lot pressure on me.

As you will be told by nearly every health professional you mean, many people with your disorder lead very successful lives. Now, the bullshit being said, the road to recovery begins with recognition. You now know that your brain works a little different. You&#039;re a little bit like Neo, special, and everyone sees you differently once they know you are the One. That fucks you up even more, or at least in my case it does/did.<br /><br />I think this kind of site, where you can be completely (hopefully) anonymous, you can put all your thoughts for others to read. There are very intelligent people on the forums, but it takes patience to wait for their voices. At any rate, start researching medications. Medications are half the battle. Watch for side effects. If it takes away your sense of identity or some trait you hold to be who you are, then stop and look for another drug. This is also a patience game... Psychotropic drugs take up to 6 weeks to fully take effect, which is due to liver adaptation and neurotransmitter stockpiling. Be patient... but also remember that these fucking drugs can push you to suicide... so watch out for that, too!<br /><br />Good luck, my friend.
