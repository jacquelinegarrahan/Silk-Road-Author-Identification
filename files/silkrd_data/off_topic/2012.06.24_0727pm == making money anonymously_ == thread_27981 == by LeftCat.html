				I know SR is pretty good for this sort of thing, but...<br /><br />I was wondering instead of drugs, there was something like financial fraud or atm/debit card stuff where money could change hands with as few trails leading to me as possible.<br /><br />Any help (if anyone knows what I&#039;m talking about)?

We do indeed offer such services over SR.<br /><br />The ultimate financial guru for concealing larger amounts of cash is the Moderator Limetless who like me, works in finance. <br /><br />Obviously the Bitcoin itself is designed to allow anonymous transfers of money but the system is only safe end to end if you use cash/goods to buy and sell your Bitcoins - of course your problems don&#039;t necessarily end there as a pile of cash under your bed for instance is rather hard to conceal and as such many vendors like me try to help people find ways to conceal their profits e.g through setting up new bank accounts and/or investing their money.<br /><br />If you&#039;re asking though if we have information on stolen credit cards here the answer is no, it&#039;s against the forum rules. If you&#039;re interested in such things there is another marketplace named BlackMarket Reloaded which deals with lists of stolen credit card details, bank account numbers etc. if you want me to send you the link, send me a message.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think you are asking that in the wrong forum. I just sent you a pm for the correct place to learn all about fraudulent finances.
