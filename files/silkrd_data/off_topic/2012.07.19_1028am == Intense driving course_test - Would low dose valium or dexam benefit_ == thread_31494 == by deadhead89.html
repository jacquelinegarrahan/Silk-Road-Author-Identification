				I have an intensive course next week, i have had already around 25 hours lessons, i have stopped smoking weed for a few days before to allow my brain to be in optimal condition, I just bought primiracetem and choline which i will be starting monday (day i start my course, i hope this improves memory and concentration for the lessons and test.<br /><br />I was wondering whether anyone has any expierence in taking dexamphetamine when driving or low dose 5/2.5 valium for anxiety for test

				I sometimes use low doses of valium for things like timed technical ability tests that employers do (those things rattle my nerves for some reason) or even job interviews. No doubt that valium will decrease the overall performance of someone who does not suffer anxiety, but if your anxiety causes more of a problem then a small does of valium does, it may be worth it. But you know how shit valium is for your memory and your motor coordination, you&#039;d have to get the balance just right.<br /><br />You can always re-sit the test right? I&#039;d say do it sober 1st time round, if your nerves are really bad and cause you to fail then take something next time. I failed my 1st test because of nerves, it sucked :( <br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t suggest taking Valium before a driving test, especially since it can slow your reaction time. However, like BanWork said, if your anxiety is bad enough to where the Valium may put you at baseline, then you could try it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend taking any amphetamine, as this can increase your anxiety; not to mention making you more irritable (like it does to me). I&#039;m a very impatient driver, especially on dexamph. <br /><br />sdesu
