				So let me go ahead and start by saying this could get long....Im still pretty tweaked.<br /><br />I Joined SR two weeks ago, and I really wanted to use it to experience some of the as of yet unobtainable goodies I do not have access to. Geography, social reasons, whatever the reason, there are certain things I have not come across in my years of use and abuse. Narrowed my list down to meth or coke (i am sure there exists a supply for both)<br /><br />I figured I would go ahead and give crystal meth a shot, got a 1g order. Started Wed at around 10am, did a small bump....burns like hell, but i sort of like the burn. within about 2 minutes Im pretty much feeling like &quot;Yup, exactly what i was expecting&quot; I had flirted with adderall and ritalin in the past so I had some idea of the state of mind.....at least at that very early point in this binge. I went into this thinking that, like my pill abuse, I could keep this confined to an &quot;as needed to focus&quot; sort of rationalization. I went to work, I also felt compelled to take some with me just in case work got busy, or stressful, i could redose and stay on top of my tasks. As soon as i grabbed the snuff bullet (thanks Dark Moon!) i got this feeling of forshadowing....it had been 3 hours since my first bump, and already my brain wanted more. Got to work, became super-employee, great mood....dosed 2 more times in the 9hr shift.....When I got home around 10pm, the smart rational part of me knew i should not touch anymore meth and let the crash happen.....but I had just been at work! I didnt get to have any &quot;fun&quot; so out comes the bullet....another bump. Wednesday night....is pretty much me sitting at the computer reading forum posts, browsing my favorite sites, commenting(holy shit epic blocks of rambling nonsense) on forums.....for 9 more hours. Im sure i redosed somewhere in those 9 hours, i honestly cant remember....I was absolutely focused on the screen.<br /><br />&nbsp;By 7am Thursday, I am feeling some aches and muscle pains...almost like the aches after a normal day, but intensified obviously because I havent had sleep....My back was absolutely killing me....but...instead of taking a Klonopin, smoking a bowl and ending it there.....despite that being my plan, i reached for the bullet.....Thursday was filled with much of the same as Wed, except i had to run some errands....so i got out of the house....I noticed a slight headache creeping up, and realized i probably wasnt drinking enough water.....i certainly hadnt eaten anything substantial, maybe a few pretzel chips, and i think a can of tuna since the start of the binge....<br /><br />By 7pm Thursday, Im feeling pretty shitty, still sore, still a headache despite making an effort to hydrate more(gatorade...its got electrolytes)<br />and eat a little bit....and Im torn:<br /><br />&quot;Is this the crash i was warned about? Do i really want to sleep from now until saturday night? I could do just one more bump and have a few more hours of focus and fun.......Yep, another bump....<br /><br />This time there was the familiar burn, but after waiting i felt no change in my mental or physical state..&quot;.well, maybe ive gained a bit of a tolerance, ill just try one more&quot; so i did another......this brought back the hyper focus, but my body still felt awful....stomach in knots, back was sore.......I kept this up until around 2am this morning.......I didnt take the klonopin, i just passed out on my couch....i woke up at 11 this morning, still sore and felt the cloudiness that comes with the morning after a fun night multiplied by about 5. I walked over to the desk, and took two bumps, i feel alert, but i dont feel &quot;good&quot;, the next thing that shouldve clued me in on the fact that my brain was depleted of dopamine was that it was at least an hour after waking that i wandered outdoors for a smoke....its only now that i realize nothing that i can do will alter this comedown, despite knowing that i have to let it happen, part of me is sad....even though if i were going to keep it going id just be prolonging this sore, alert but sort of dazed fogginess that had me in its grips.<br /><br />My thoughts about this experience are that I came into this thinking I had a firm understanding of what it means to tell yourself no. I did not excersise the willpower required to not fall into the binge/crash cycle I had only read about. I have kicked a pretty fierce opiate addiction in the past.....so Im not sure why I thought I would be able to control a new drug experience, at least in terms of not letting a night or day of fun turn into almost 3 days. Some people may be able to handle this drug in the weekend warrior sense....but im not sure if I can. maybe its my nature to push a drug to my personal limits.....ive taken some pretty heroic doses of lsd......maybe part of me wanted this....and who knows, maybe its a good thing....because this right now, is not fun. If.....I should say when i do meth again, i know what exactly what kind of feeling is waiting if I dont place limits and i allow myself to binge....Im not sure how some people can keep going and continue feeling good after 2 days....<br /><br />It is a fun drug, i see very clearly the potential for abuse, i realize that as a addict, i am playing with fire. If anyone out there has any tips for avoiding a binge, id love to hear them. I enjoyed every part of this experience aside from the fatigue that became overwhelming and the slight disappointment in my lack of self control, I say slight because after a certain point of whatever bullshit justification i gave myself for continuing, more and more of me just wanted to see how far i could go before i wanted it to end. <br /><br />Despite not having redosed since this morning i still feel like im getting the hyperfocused, mind racing, talkative aspec, but my body is still fucked. What kind of saturday am I in for? I just packed a bowl, if Im not tired after that, ill take a klonipin....no nore meth....its pointless at this point. im guessing im going to have the blues for a few days, thats my expectation....no worries....kicking methadone gave me the fucking blues for 6 months AFTER my last 5mg dose....so a few days of depression should be doable...im anticipating some cravings to hit soon....<br /><br />I hate to sound negative, i see the greatness of the drug, all in all i consider this a positive, learning experience....<br /><br />if anyone made it through all that nonsense, thanks for reading! <br /><br /><br />*Edit to add a few things I left out. Aside from the desire to tackle another mind bending chemical, the other reason I wanted to try it was to experience it for myself. Growing up in an area that is for the most part unaffected by the so called &quot;Meth Epidemic&quot; (I&#039;m sure its out therre somewhere, but in all of my local dealings not one person has ever provided me a connection) I have read all of the horror stories, seen all the propaganda, watched supposedly unbiased documentaries and all of those created a preconceived notion. I&#039;m withholding final judgement until I return to baseline and reflect on this without the &quot;15 different thoughts at once&quot; hyperactive brain.<br /><br />Also please forgive my horrible grammar and spelling mistakes......Im remote desktoped to my PC from the couch on my ipad....I could clean up things as I see them, but its a bitch and whenever i tried to go back and fix something it would derail whatever train of thought i was currently typing...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s a great drug under the right circumstances, but it&#039;s the only drug that I feel like I have no control over when I do it. That&#039;s why I don&#039;t do it anymore. I had some epic times with it, but eventually after 8 months of daily use I went into a psychosis for a few months, and I believe this is the inevitable conclusion to prolonged daily use because of staying up nights so often. I wasn&#039;t doing huge amounts either, just bumps here and there throughout the day, but the drug is so strong that a little bump can keep you going all night and into the next day. Now, I do believe there is value in the drug and things to be learned, like I said I had some epic times with it. But when you do it every day you&#039;re playing with fire in the truest sense, and most likely you will eventually get burned, and it won&#039;t be pretty.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible for most people to use self control with this drug. I like drugs, but I do not recommend that anyone makes a habit out of doing meth. A little bit here and there isn&#039;t going to hurt you and can be great fun and you can learn a lot, but daily use is a no-no.

Week after week of &quot;When will my legs stop aching?! Why can&#039;t I get out of bed? Will I sleep more than 3 hours a night this week?&quot;<br /><br />Going through all of that, I made the classic mistake of just having an oxy....I had fun, but didn&#039;t feel like having another one. I have plenty of ways of getting my original DOC, and since that first oxy I&#039;ve had a few more over the year, but its not something I seek out or crave. That prolonged withdrawal pushed me to the brink of suicide, I was an absolute cry baby I&#039;m sure, but I would&#039;ve given anything to just feel &quot;normal&quot; not fucked up and nodding off....just normal....and then almost instantly, one night after months of hell I got a full night of sleep, woke up, got out of bed, and my legs didnt feel like I had been doing squats all night, and walked outside and man, i swear the blue morning sky was the bluest I&#039;ve ever seen. Taking the occasional oxy and not falling back into old habits gave me the false sense that I really could set limits and obey them. And I&#039;m sure anyone who has been through an opiate addiction,withdrawal, sobriety relapse cycle will tell me, It could happen to me again, and they are right....but so far &quot;I&#039;m behind the wheel&quot;<br /><br />I am humbled by the power of this drug to take self control and just obliterate it. I feel arrogant for thinking I could stop whenever i wanted. I&#039;m sure some Meth users with actual habits will read this and laugh at how naive I sound.......trust me, I&#039;m laughing too. Because now, I &quot;get it&quot; and maybe that&#039;s what I set out to find.

				1.5mg of Klonopin seems to be bringing this to a close pretty smoothly.

At the end when i was absolutely exhausted, i would find myself sitting very still, almost catatonic....id realize thst my arm was tingling because i had been holding it in a strange position while lost in rambling internal dialog. very weird experience...but any hopes i had for focusing my attention on a real task after that first night were gone.....plenty of focus, but on the most random shit... <br /><br />Again, my personal experience, not saying its like this for everyone.
