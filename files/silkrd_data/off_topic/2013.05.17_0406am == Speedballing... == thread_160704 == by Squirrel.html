				So, there was another speedball death a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Some rapper (Chris Kelly), I guess.&nbsp; That follows about 10 other celebrity deaths (including a king) before it.&nbsp; What is the allure that would put you in a state so close to death but make you want it more.&nbsp; Well, it&#039;s a bit of a conundrum but let me articulate.&nbsp; Because the high is fucking awesome.&nbsp; That&#039;s why.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve never tried it before, you owe yourself this one luxury before you take the boat to the other side.&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking about railing it though.&nbsp; Just snort it and be enveloped in the best high ever.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; But be fucking careful, will you?

				I think I would not take the risk of death. No matter how good the high is. <br />Cause I dont wanna go out with drugs in my system. Would really make mother really sad.

				Oh man...that sucks to hear about his death.<br /><br />But yeah, I did this the other day. Snorted a bit of coke, took a couple tabs and mmm...I was on it!! Went to work and was like a speedy, floating machine..didn&#039;t quite know what to do with myself since I was so damn quick at getting everything set up. Might do it again if I get some more coke but I wouldn&#039;t make it a habit.<br /><br />Also probably wouldn&#039;t do it again anytime soon since the boyfriend was a tad bit worried about me when I told him...poor guy loves me so much!

Since you can safely &quot;go hard&quot; and add 30% more coke, but if your not an opiate user, adding 30% more H also may indeed kill you once the shorter acting coke wears off.<br /><br />Thats what I gathered, its not the actual MIXING of the two but primarily people that don&#039;t use H doing it (usually coke users) and the H ultimately gets them, they think they can handle it since the coke counteracts the H until it wears off 20 mins later.<br /><br />Amirite?

				I know the lead singer of Alice in Chains died from a speedball.<br /><br />Wikipedia shows heaps.<br /><br />King George V was euthanized via a morphine cocaine speedball way back too, interesting.<br /><br />They are fun but also crazy risky. But yeah think the big risk and the high number of OD&#039;s are opiate naive people (coke users) doing this for the first time as their H first time. Opiate experienced or tolerant ppl would be MUCH less likely to risk death like this.<br /><br />I want one now if I am honest :(&nbsp;

Have an epipen or naloxone next to you if you feel your pulse getting weaker and weaker. Still wouldn&#039;t stop respiratory arrest though. But I&#039;m only making wild guesses never done that stuff myself. Safety margin is way too low for my liking. Stay safe guys.
