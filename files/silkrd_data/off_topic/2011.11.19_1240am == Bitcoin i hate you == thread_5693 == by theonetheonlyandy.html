				Yeah it almost never goes up. You really have to keep yer eyes open. I have made out a few times. One thing you can do is put an advance BTC sale up on an exchange. It won&#039;t be that cost yet, but once it does fer even a second, you will cash out without having to be there.

				When I buy BTC (as opposed to mining a few here and there) I&#039;m ready to deposit them into my SR account and make a purchase. I try to eliminate as much of the market volatility as possible. Has worked pretty well so far, except for buying a $20 MoneyPak and getting charged $4.64 for it. lol
