				Ok, not sure why anybody else hasnt thought of this yet, but wouldnt it be cool to have a black t-shirt with white lettering and all it sed was &quot;http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion&quot; across the chest? i guess thats kinda incriminating, but only in the way that wearing a t-shirt with a potleaf on it is, maybe less... i dunno, as a lil nerd i would love to see this happen. if anyones got pro means to get this done, i would totally buy. shit, maybe ill make it myself :D&nbsp; &lt;3&nbsp; ~smod

				The direct link is an outright horrible idea. The camel is somewhat less conspicuous the only problem I can think of is it would promote a ton of blabbing due to questions about this Green camel. So it seems an overall bad idea as well :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				You guys are think this is a bad idea are paranoid.&nbsp; At least in the US there&#039;s nothing illegal about promoting SilkRoad or visiting the website.&nbsp; People wear t-shirts with cannabis leaves, NORML, MPP, Dancesafe.org, 420, Mary &amp; Molly &amp; Lucy&nbsp; &amp; Dubstep, and limitless other drug references.&nbsp; Unless you hang around with some very well-informed law enforcement officers nobody is going to harass you for having a URL or a freaking Camel on your shirt.&nbsp; 99.9% of them have no idea what it is.&nbsp; I&#039;ll make a bet, you wear a Bob Marley shirt and I will wear a Silk Road shirt and we will see who gets more attention from cops.&nbsp; :D

				ok you guys i just had a scary thought.&nbsp; what if like a LE officer person was behind one of these seller accounts, establishing trust, just waiting for something to do with his collected addresses. now, he can sell t-shirts, and all the person has to do is walk out of the house wearing the shirt as proof that he received it.... oh wait, but its not illegal to buy a shirt from silk road, is it? WELL, it would certainly take balls to wear it. i think it might make one feel pretty fucking badass,actually, um... freeman! expect this idea to take off as a new constant to the site, and dont forget who sed it first on the forums! ;)&nbsp; ~smod did

				In consideration of the feedback, I&#039;ve decided to go with the solo camel rider graphic with no text.&nbsp; I just spoke with the printer who is having the art department look at it and I should have a quote in the next day or two.&nbsp; As long as the pricing is good and I can offer high quality shirts for a reasonable price and still make a profit, then I should have them up in a week or so.

				You want a Tshirt with a camel on it? Buy one from the cigarette company. Camels... I believe PhilipMorris owns them. Look into it.<br /><br />&nbsp;Leave SR advertising to small groups of friends and word of mouth ways. No reason to buy nation tv ad space and put us all out there. Let like minded individuals find us on there own. <br /><br />At the scientologist meetings/rallies/get togethers, lets hold up signs and where tshirts that promote building up America&#039;s infrastructure. Securing our borders and ports. Education for all, anytime. Help homeless vets. Promote the advancement of beautiful women. Something important! Not a f*n camel on a shirt.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				ummmmm k?&nbsp; well, me personally, i would like a large probly since itll shrink... meh prolly even large if its preshrunk. i want a color i can wear with jeans and i would like it if it was just the camel logo on the front and nothing on the back. with all the pointless graphic tees of wolves n such you can get from walmart, i really think of this more as a nod to existing community members rather than an ad to outsiders. nobody will think twice, theyll just think maybe im trailer trash and like the bargain bin :D but INSIDERS will be like... yeah... thass wassup lol ANYway...

USE COMMON SENSE! If the cops don&#039;t know what it is, believe me when they start seeing SR camel tshirts they will figure it out soon enough. IF you don&#039;t have heat (LE) in your area you soon will. It&#039;s like a beacon!

				To the (few) people who think this is no different than a pot leaf... uh, think again. Wearing a pot leaf suggests you smoke weed. Smoking weed and participating in drug trafficking are two very different things that draw very different kinds of attention. A pot leaf goes unnoticed in most places, especially where weed culture is more mainstream. A shirt suggesting your involvement in a market that governments world wide would like shut down, on the other hand, is pretty much asking for the cops to monitor your ass.
