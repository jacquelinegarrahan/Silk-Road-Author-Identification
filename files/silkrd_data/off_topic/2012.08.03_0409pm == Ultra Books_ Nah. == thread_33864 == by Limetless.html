				Has anyone seen the adverts for Ultra Books on the telly lately? It just looks like non-Apple companies trying to do something to rival the Macbook in coolness but just failing substantially before reaching the mark. <br /><br />Mac snob you say? Why yes, yes I am.

				yeah, that&#039;s just a fancy name for a laptop that can keep up with current multimedia stuff.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t come, remarket it under a different name.&nbsp; In the US laptop sales are down quite a bit because so many people have adopted tablets, now the computer manufacturers are trying to convince them to come back.

I don&#039;t have an iPad as the only thing I&#039;d use it for is as a table mat or something to rack up lines on, although I have thought of buying one so I can use it for those purposes. Because so many brands are releasing these Ultra Books it is quite clear this is a Manufacturers + Microsoft Vs Apple thing, what a load of Betty Swallocks indeed.

				I suspect that is the reason there are no print drivers available for tablets, if people could print from them laptops would be a thing of the past and a lot of big companies would start losing money.&nbsp; I have an android tablet and I love it, use it for nearly everything except stuff I need to print. Even then, the tablets do work with cloud printing services, you just can&#039;t print directly to a printer.

After this thread though I have decided I&#039;m going to go and buy an iPad to do Coke off. This weekends quest has been confirmed.

				well at least put a zagg screen on it first so you don&#039;t scratch the thing, because I&#039;m telling you once you start using it you will be addicted.&nbsp; Mine has a detachable kb, which makes it lighter and handier then hauling around a laptop for work.
