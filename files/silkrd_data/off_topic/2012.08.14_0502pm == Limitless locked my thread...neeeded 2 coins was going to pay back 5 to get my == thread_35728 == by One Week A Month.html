				Dude, any chance you had of opening a vendor account with good customer service was just exposed of immaturity if it wasn&#039;t already from your previous begging threads.<br />Just hang it up, anyone with any sense that has been watching this unfold would never buy from you. Just let it go.

				What a fucking whiny little bitch, seriously, if you want to be a vendor and cannot deal with setting up an account, how the hell do you expect to deal with cashing out, waiting on escrow to re-up, sorting refunds and re-ships. This is not the game for you.
