				You guys...I flipped my head over to blow-dry my hair this morning and when I stood upright I began to feel a nagging, sharp pain in my neck that I immediately recognized as nerve compression. Only this was the worst pinched nerve I&#039;ve ever suffered--all day I have not been able to move my neck, and am having trouble even sitting upright at times. All I had lying around today was a tramadol and a muscle relaxer, which helped somewhat...any other suggestions for what to do (take)? May be seeing a chiropractor if it doesn&#039;t go away.

				I&#039;ve had this happen. Only thing I could do was take pain killers &amp; muscle relaxers (on hand) and wait it out.<br />took about 4 days to subside. I suppose if you keep straining your neck It might take longer.

				Like the above post said, any painkillers will suffice,but often times, they will dull the pain at hand whilst on them, in turn keeping your pinched nerve from getting better in a short time.

				Yeah, trying to rest as much as possible, but the pain is unbearable at times. I actually cried from it today, and I have a pretty high pain tolerance.

				What do you have available to you as far as pain killers go? Or any ketamine by chance?

				not kidding- have an orgasm. also try using a vibrator/massager on your neck and a hot bath or maybe in a steamy room. im not sure if its safe, im not really an electrician or anything so pls don&#039;t hurt yourself , but if its all good I imagine loosened muscles and vibration would fix you right up.

I have SHIT for painkillers and am on vacation so can&#039;t see a doc til I get back home. but I will. trust me, I will. <br />My neck is actually a lot better, but in the mornings it&#039;s still stiff as hell.<br />The muscle relaxers helped a lot, but just one knocked me OUT.<br />This has been happening more and more frequently, it&#039;s becoming almost chronic. We&#039;ll see what the doc says...how would K help this situation? lol just curious, I can get my hands on some locally
