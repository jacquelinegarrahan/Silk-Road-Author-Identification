				Yeah, its not like Obama gets massive donations from corrupt banks, namely Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, and has been extremely beneficial to them, or that he completely shit on Bradley Manning, who exposed blatant government misconduct, or stomps on civil liberties with the NDAA, wire tapping and drones, or cuts domestic spending, or furthers these absurd military occupations. None of that happened, right?<br /><br />And then theres this Ron Paul guy, who has never voted for tax increases, bailouts, overseas spending, unbalanced budgets, would allow states to legalize anything they want, defends the constitution which has been completely disregarded, understands the Austrian school of economic thought, which enabled him to predict the housing market bubble FIVE YEARS in advance, literally naming Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, and would fight the Federal Reserve which robs us blind by creating currency out of thin air, thereby diluting the currency pool and devaluing the dollar, or would pull our military out of the 140 countries we are in (and dont have the money to be in).

				GM is a live and well.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they shut down the Chevy Volt factories for six months due to no demand on this massive &quot;flagship&quot; project.<br /><br />Greatest president I would say is Washington, namely because he turned down some serious power and resisted the evil temptations that drive people to become members of the political class in the first place.<br /><br />Greatest president of the past 100 years, though, is Warren Harding.&nbsp; Mainly because he did the least of any president in that time and allowed the Great Depression of 1920 to end itself in 18 months instead of 18 fucking years (FDR - someone should have assassinated him).&nbsp; Obama is just another in a long history of not-funny joke excuses for real fucking men, who can&#039;t bring themselves to actually produce something useful for their fellow man and instead seek power by vicariously wielding millions of guns and imposing mandates with more concentrated violent force than all of human history has known previously.

				As much as I think he&#039;s a cool guy from how he comes across, to me Obama is just a puppet president like many others before him, he&#039;s an intelligent and highly charming guy, but I don&#039;t like a lot of his policies and the fact that under his regime there&#039;s been drastically increased internet censorship and the democrats are going after 2nd amendment rights hard, trying to take away people&#039;s right to own firearms.&nbsp; I knew the &quot;change&quot; he promised back in 2008 was bullshit the moment I heard it, but he&#039;s no worse than any other president in terms of not delivering on promises.&nbsp; I think the government is a total joke, it doesn&#039;t matter who wins this upcoming election, the everyday people will still be fucked in the ass with the same old bullshit regardless of which corporate-sponsored party gets into office.<br /><br />A guy like Ron Paul would never get close to a nomination, because if his policies were implemented they would cost money to mega-corporations who always want to make sure that laws and policies are implemented and enforced to best further their interests and make the wealthiest 1% wealthier every year.&nbsp; American politics now are more corrupt than ever, and blatantly so, since now wealthy individuals and corporations can just publicly give infinite amounts of money to campaigns of their favorite puppet candidates, I&#039;m surprised people are ok with it and there isn&#039;t a revolution brewing / riots all the time.&nbsp; You can practically just buy the presidency now, what the hell kind of democracy is that?&nbsp; Pretty sure this shit that&#039;s going on now isn&#039;t what the founding fathers had in mind all those years ago when they wrote the constitution. &gt;:(

Wake up, dammit!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unfortunately sir, you&#039;re quite misinformed.<br /><br />First off, BUSH bailed out the banks. BUSH. That&#039;s right, president BUSH bailed out the banks only weeks before he left office and left Obama with the problem of how to pay all that off. Obama bailed out the auto industry, the last great manufacturing base in America. The auto bailout was also ten times smaller than the financial industry bailout.<br /><br />Second, wtf are Orwellian robotic monstrosities...?<br /><br />Third, I do agree that Obama is a puppet. But I&#039;m pretty sure you threw out the word puppet without the slightest clue who pulls his strings. The answer my friend is the banking elites of the world. Libya was invaded because Gaddafi planned to institute his &quot;Gold Dinar Plan&quot; (look it up) which would compete with the U.S. dollar and seriously damage its value. Btw, Gaddafi was not in violation of any human rights... Gaddafi gave up power to a democratically elected government in 1977 for which he was just a figurehead. Through IMF Structural Adjustment Policies, the banking elites control every nation&#039;s money supply and thus effectively control every nation themselves. Gaddafi should be praised for attempting to liberate his country from the clutch of the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and the like.<br /><br />Should you be blaming the puppet...? I think that&#039;s exactly what the puppeteer would want.<br /><br />On a similar note, Sadam Hussein tried to implement a very similar policy in 2000. He decided that all oil exports would be traded for Euros rather than U.S. dollars... do you know what followed? Sanctions and an invasion.<br /><br /><br />But I think it&#039;s important to make a distinction between Obama&#039;s failures and his accomplishments. Just because he supported the invasion of Libya does not mean he is an entirely corrupt man.<br /><br />For example, the health care reform bill. This wasn&#039;t a &quot;socialist&quot; agenda that forced hard-working citizens to pay more taxes so that lazy people can get free health insurance (as the conservatives so easy liked to call it). It was mainly tort reform, in that you couldn&#039;t be denied coverage if you had had a pre-existing condition and you couldn&#039;t have your insurance dropped if a condition suddenly developed. Do you think it was just before this bill when a child could be turned away from a hospital because insurance companies did not want to pay for costly treatment?<br /><br />Unfortunately this bill was heavily watered down just so it would pass through Congress. It&#039;s unfortunate, however, that the Republican controlled Congress refuses to cooperate at all, even attempting to reverse all progress Obama has made. It&#039;s like the two parties sometimes forget that we&#039;re all Americans. So much more could be accomplished if the two would work together.<br /><br />Obama has made many other improvements to our society, but my post is long enough so I&#039;ll save it for a different response.

Do you think it was just before this bill when a child could be turned away from a hospital because insurance companies did not want to pay for costly treatment?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You do not understand USA tort law.<br /><br />I honestly lol&#039;d when I read your statement.

				Fuck Obama, fuck McCain, nail Palin, screw Gore, pistolwhip all politicians. I would have thought that people on this board knew better then being pro any oppressor who denies us our basic human right of self determination. We are a peaceful group of people who are being forced into violence and underground societies being criminalized by our so called leaders. The war on drugs became a war on people while our oppressors try to move the total wealth of the world to their side and leaving us with next to nothing. Pharmaceutical companies are putting a price on the health of us humans. We live in a world where people have to choose to buy food or pay rent, go to school or get medicine, be jobless or be a criminal.<br /><br />Our world is fucked up until we will make a stand. We can make a stand by giving people the basic needs in society. We didn&#039;t come to this world to struggle and have no power left to fight our oppressors. We should have to ability to stand up against our governments without having the fear of our homes being foreclosed, have a price being put on our health, be worth more death then alive to our employers and so on!<br /><br />How can we make a stand, by voting for a politician? NO! We can make a stand by distributing the wealth we get to people who have less and tell them the rant that I wrote above. That way they will not have to worry about basic things which make us human the next time they protest against anything. Until that happens we will keep our mouths shut because we dont want to lose our job which we need to pay off debts generated by the central banks.<br /><br />

				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br /><br />Mitanox is right.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll add that I think life in the Western nations is too comfortable (for most) for people to really take any kind of real action to change the corruption and degradation of our governments.&nbsp; <br /><br />They let us live our lives with what we think are important choices and options, but in reality we make no real choices in this world unless real action is taken.&nbsp; We choose between two parties bought and paid for by the same sources.&nbsp; The strings are pulled by a few choice power players and the obscenely wealthy, and change, awakening, reorientation is not in their interests.&nbsp; These statists are complicit to the misery incurred by their constructs, and we stand by and put them there expecting things to change.&nbsp; <br /><br />They also have at their disposal millions of the unthinking and fearful.&nbsp; People who have never been anywhere or done anything in their lives but hate and fear.&nbsp; They are kept in the dark; exactly where the statists want us to be.&nbsp; They&#039;d rather us shut the world out with SSRI&#039;s, instead of open the doors to our perception like LSD.<br /><br />&quot;You say there&#039;s a certain tragic or melancholic tone in all this. I think I can see why. I was very struck by all the passages in Primo Levi where he explains that Nazi camps have given us &quot;a shame at being human.&quot; Not, he says, that we&#039;re all responsible for Nazism, as some would have us believe, but that we&#039;ve all been tainted by it: even the survivors of the camps had to make compromises with it, if only to sur­vive. There&#039;s the shame of there being men who became Nazis; the shame of being unable, not seeing how, to stop it; the shame of hav­ing compromised with it; there&#039;s the whole of what Primo Levi calls this &quot;gray area.&quot; And we can feel shame at being human in utterly triv­ial situations, too: in the face of too great a vulgarization of thinking, in the face of tv entertainment, of a ministerial speech, of &quot;jolly peo­ple&quot; gossiping. This is one of the most powerful incentives toward phi­losophy, and it&#039;s what makes all philosophy political. In capitalism only one thing is universal, the market. There&#039;s no universal state, precisely because there&#039;s a universal market of which states are the centers, the trading floors. But the market&#039;s not universalizing, homogenizing, it&#039;s an extraordinary generator of both wealth and misery. A concern for human rights shouldn&#039;t lead us to extol the &quot;joys&quot; of the liberal capitalism of which they&#039;re an integral part. There&#039;s no democratic state that&#039;s not compromised to the very core by its part in generating human misery. What&#039;s so shameful is that we&#039;ve no sure way of maintaining becomings, or still more of arousing them, even within ourselves. How any group will turn out, how it will fall back into history, presents a constant &#039;concern.&#039; &quot;<br /><br />Gilles Deleuze

				I&#039;m with Mitanox on this, there isn&#039;t even going to be a &quot;great&quot; president until things break down hard enough that we no longer have to work through Tor, and I know it&#039;s going to be fucked up, but shit, I&#039;m waiting on the sun to shine and I say that not because it&#039;s raining outside my window.

				I think Mr. Keats is right, Obama has accomplished some things.<br /><br />But I&#039;d rather give a +1 to Dorset for being first to eloquently diss a disappointment of a president. <br /><br />His greatest achievement as far as the rest of the world is concerned is not being bush...<br /><br />Obama has brought in laws that allow anyone to be held indefinitely without trial, that is not a liberal measure by any sense of the word.<br /><br />I can&#039;t vote in your elections so my opinion doesn&#039;t count but I don&#039;t think it matters since your only real options are corporate stooges and sell outs...

				As most Europeans i prefer Obama over any Republican. But fact of the matter he&#039;s also gotta satisfy the whole military industrial complex and financial sector interests which are both are much powerful than him. So, although i&#039;m not a conspiritorist i do believe there is much which is beyond his power.

				Obama is a worthless lying two faced sack of shit.<br /><br />Obamacare was a total power grab. They have emptied the Social security &quot;ponzi scheme&quot; fund and now need a new piggy back. Operation Fast and Furious was his and holders brain child to try and strip our guns from us. He claimed to half the debt and balance the budget HAHAHAHHA how about almost double it and bankrupt the country.

				Obama promised to meet with foreign leaders of enemy states. He lied. He promised to close Guantanamo. He didn&#039;t. He promised to try Guantanomo prisoners in U.S. courts. He didn&#039;t. He promised to restore habeaus corpus. He made it worse. He promised he&#039;d withdraw from Iraq ASAP. He did it on the Republican time-table. That&#039;s just a sample of promises that Obama made - promises that resulted in me voting for him last election. I can&#039;t trust him. But I don&#039;t know who else I would vote for.

				just another puppet of the corporations. Its really more &quot;At the people&quot; than &quot;by the people&quot; anymore. It doesnt matter who THEY put in office....We can vote...but THEY decide which choices we have. Either way its big $$$ that wins. <br /><br />And for any of the racist comments....Obama isnt black enough for me. Id rather have 1970s richard prior in office....at least then it wouldnt seem like such a bullshit festival.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OP, you make me sad. Mr. Obama doesn&#039;t even count as outstanding among even the more mediocre American presidents. In comparison to the second Mr. Bush, he seems much better, but he&#039;s done nothing outstanding except subtly expanding the state&#039;s reach into our privacy and doing away with a few more freedoms. In many ways, he&#039;s performed exactly the same as Bush, with exactly the same agenda, but the sheeple are too dumb to see it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great president?&nbsp; No. I would put Hayes and Fillmore above him easily. Clinton, Reagan, Nixon, hell even Johnson was better than him. Greatest president? No. With presidents like Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt (both of them), Washington, Kennedy and a host of others? The comparison is so poor I have to wonder if you were trolling, or haven&#039;t paid attention in history classes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll climb down from my soapbox now.<br />
