				How would one go about doing this? i know its mostly scratching off serial numbers.. but is that really it?<br />i herd u scratch up the barrel too and this will make it so the bullets cant be traced to it either.. <br /><br />any advice or tips would be great.. <br /><br />or if this kind of subject isnt allowed.. well sorry lol.. but im curious.

				i think you will get better and more founded answers at the BMR forum&nbsp; ( http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/ )because these guys actually deal with weapons.<br /><br />all i know is that you can scratch as much as you want but the serial number can still be made visible if you know how to (LEO knows)

				Fuck up your bore and you fuck up any chance of long-range accuracy, depending on the firearm. And not that I know this for a fact, but that&#039;s sounds really dangerous to top it off.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing there&#039;s gonna be some way to do just that without messing it up, but for that matter you might as well just swap out the barrel with a compatible one, but for a different make and model. If you don&#039;t know much about guns you&#039;d better read up on ballistic forensics. That&#039;s where you&#039;ll learn about tracing bullets to bores and therefore to the gun it was fired from. The more you know, the better you prepare.<br /><br />Fun tip, shotguns typically have a smooth bore (no rifling in the barrel, so no way to match the exact slug to the exact gun after it has been fired and recovered) if you&#039;re going that route.<br /><br /><br />But yes, BMR will be more helpful than SR I think.

				Look up acid etching. If you don&#039;t shave deep enough they can still make out the numbers. Shave too deep and you are changing the gun structurally.<br /><br />You don&#039;t want to scratch up the inside of the barrel. Get a new one - they are cheap.
