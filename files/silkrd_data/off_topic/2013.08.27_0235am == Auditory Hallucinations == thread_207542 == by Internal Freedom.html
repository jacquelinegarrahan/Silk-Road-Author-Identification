				Up until a music festival that I attended several weeks ago, I had never experienced an audio hallucination. Even after doing LSD, 2C-B, Shrooms, 25i, DMT and many other psychedelics DOZENS of times.<br /><br />I had done MDA the second day of the music festival and on the way home that night I heard all the songs I had listened to that day playing full volume while I was in the car. It was amazing because I was still moving to the music and enjoying it even thought it wasn&#039;t actually there and no one else in the car with me could hear it. <br /><br />Then I experienced another audio hallucination while taking mescaline two weeks ago, while I was lying down with my eyes closed admiring the patterns appearing, I heard the song &quot;I don&#039;t want to set the world on fire&quot; by the Ink Spots played FULLY from start to finish. Every single word and note in the song was perfect. Im really starting to enjoy these considering I only recently started experiencing them. Does anyone know any other drugs which may help me to experience intense audio hallucinations? I want to try and keep my MDA trips to a maximum of a few times a year and Mescaline is expensive as shit and I cant do it very often.
