				640-720 mcg of LSD with 130 mg of MDA.<br /><br />8.5 g of shrooms<br /><br />7 massive rips of 80x salvia (4 occasions)<br /><br />I can not honestly say which one was stronger as the experiences were so different.

				15 grams of shrooms, by far the worst trip I&#039;ve ever had. That was when I was inexperienced and stupid and young and thought I&#039;d just get some really cool visuals. I ended up puking and thinking my vomit was an evil spirit trying to reverse drown me for several hours. Would not recommend.<br /><br />I also was lucky enough to thumbprint LSD once, although I&#039;ve only had experience with crystals that one time and I can&#039;t honestly give an amount, but it was WELL beyond 1000 micrograms.
