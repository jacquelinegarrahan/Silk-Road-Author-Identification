				First thing that would cross my mind if I were ever handed down a sentence term is the thought of getting raped in prison.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure others feel the same.&nbsp; So what can we do about it?&nbsp; What are some ways to prevent it?&nbsp; Why would anyone want to do it in the first place?&nbsp; If I were in prison I would expect everyone around me to at least have some sort of mindset that we all have to struggle together and shouldn&#039;t make each other&#039;s lives miserable than it already is.&nbsp; Still the very thought of prison rape is almost scary enough to make me stop my involvement in drugs....&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m more interested to hear from those that have been locked up and how they avoided prison rape and what they know about it.&nbsp; Hell I would not mind it if they had cameras in every nook and cranny in prison/jail just to present raping one another.

				As a chick I can tell you boys that anal sex (or &#039;birthdays and Christmas only&#039; as I call it) really isn&#039;t all that bad once you relax and get into it. A friend of mine used to be married to this chick and she could only come via anal (ha, which is why he married her I&#039;m guessing). I suppose you could go into jail with the mindset that if prison rape (or surprise sex) happens to you that you&#039;ll have to just relax and enjoy it, maybe see it as a bit of kinky 50 shades S&amp;M type shit and a case of you broadening your sexual horizons. No-one wants to end up with an arse like a windsock, but fuck it, you only live once, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;We&#039;ll work on your thousand yard stare after you&#039;re released.

				I was having a look on the clearnet and they seem to reckon that in North American prisons you&#039;re more likely to get it up the poop shoot from potential prison rapers if you&#039;re a nonce (child molester). <br /><br />Quote: &quot;Beware of rape. You are more likely to be raped if you have been convicted of a sexual offense (especially against a juvenile), have any feminine characteristics, are younger or any other trait that could be associated with displaying weakness.&quot;<br /><br />They also suggest cutting your long flowing locks, growing a beard and laying off the lavender-scented soap while you&#039;re inside. <br /><br />So presumably, if you don&#039;t mince about too much you should be alright. But you could always get a tattoo on your arse to put anyone off from touching your posterior in a sexual way like this little lady did.

				This relates to the topic at hand:<br />http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/us-more-men-raped-than-women<br /><br />***not from the article***<br /><br />In the US, Jails are different than Prisons.&nbsp; Jail is where you wait while/until you&#039;re on trial, if you can&#039;t make bond... or if convicted for a short sentence of something like less than a year.&nbsp; Prison is where you go once you&#039;re convicted and sentenced to anything greater than a year... or if they don&#039;t have room in the jail, you&#039;ll get sent here for those shorter sentences.<br /><br />In jail people are still pretty fresh... many were just out in the real world only a couple days ago, weeks ago, months ago.&nbsp; You&#039;re not far from where you lived and friends/family may visit on a regular basis, all keeping you a bit more sane.&nbsp; Jails can be worse than prisons though, depends.&nbsp; Like the jail I went through, prison was a positive step up... better food, cleaner, cloths/laundry, less lockdown time.<br /><br />Prison is where people get stale... they&#039;ve been in there for who knows how long, and are going to be in there for who knows how long.<br /><br />Each State is different, but in general...<br />Jail and prison both, when you go through your intake/arrival... it all becomes a big separation process depending on who you are.&nbsp; They don&#039;t want to put Bloods in the same place as Crips, nazi&#039;s with black people, etc. etc etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;The dude caught for smoking pot and sentenced to 2 years will not get tossed in a cell with the serial killer doing life.&nbsp; Mistake are occasionally made though.&nbsp; You are assigned something like minimum, medium, or maximum security status.&nbsp; Minimum security prisons; you have more freedoms, people are only doing short sentences, and people are still pretty fresh.&nbsp; &nbsp;Medium... people are doing longer bits and are less fresh etc.<br /><br />Getting caught for just drugs, I doubt you&#039;d get sent to a Max or SuperMax prison... unless you were caught with RPG&#039;s, SAM missiles, and a container ship full of coke or something, you&#039;re not going to get tossed to the sodomites in these places.&nbsp; These are the places where correction officers (CO&#039;s) could give two shits about trying to stop a rape, not chancing getting themselves raped and killed by trying to break it up.&nbsp; These are the places where guys are doing life, so they&#039;ll kill/rape/whatever at the slightest chance since they don&#039;t have anything else to lose anyhow.&nbsp; These guys are angry, insane, and just plain animals.&nbsp; I passed through one of these places in my state on my way to where I was going... talked to a few people that did time in those areas... scary shit.<br /><br />But like I said... for just drugs, think Blow.&nbsp; You go in with a Bachelors of marijuana, and come out with a Doctorate of coke.&nbsp; You basically just swap stories of what you did on the outside, how you got caught etc.&nbsp; You only become a better criminal.&nbsp; You don&#039;t really have to be worrying about ass rape, or getting shanked.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any rape... and I personally dropped the soap accidentally without any ill consequences.&nbsp; You play cards, read, watch tv, shoot some hoops, workout, talk about/wonder what&#039;s for dinner/lunch/b-fast... you look forward to mail time.<br /><br />My gf told me that the place she was locked up in, the male CO&#039;s would give women they desired a difficult time and get them to secretly fuck in exchange for stuff... to make their lives easier.&nbsp; Guess the CO&#039;s would falsely accuse them of something, not let them out for food/shower/yard etc., just totally break them.&nbsp; And if the women didn&#039;t break, guess she&#039;s heard of a couple instances where this or that CO would just take by force.&nbsp; Obviously this isn&#039;t taking place in front of everyone.&nbsp; Sounds crazy, but my gf has no reason to lie about it.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t get caught stealing from someone, or get in an argument about which rapper has bigger rims/better house/etc., and you&#039;ll be alright.<br />

				Also, generally the MORE secure the prison is the LESS likely you are to get shanked or raped. Jail in the USA is maximum security I believe, because they house people from serial killers to shoplifters, they need to default to the highest level (well, supermax is the highest). Not likely at all to get raped or shanked in jail, for a number of reasons. Like NN said, a lot of the people in jail plan to be out really soon, so they are not going to risk getting a ton of time when they only have a few days or weeks to serve. A lot of the ones who are facing a lot of time have not been convicted yet, and they are not going to risk getting more charges when they still are not convicted of the original ones against them. Also, everybody is fresh from the outside world and not likely to be as hardened in many cases. <br /><br />At a supermax prison you are definitely not going to get raped or shanked, because you have no contact with anybody at all or only have contact with guards. Maybe the lowest level of a supermax you will have very little contact with other inmates, but it will be under such strict security that there is no way you will be raped. <br /><br />Pretty much the less secure a prison is the more likely you are to be raped or shanked in it. Where do you think you are more likely to be raped, a prison where you have one hour of contact with other humans, under strict supervision of guards, or a prison where you share a cell with five random people? Or even in a big dormitory where you are free to move about the place, kind of like a college campus from hell. The lower security the place you are at, the more contact you will have with other people, the more isolated you will be from guards, etc. The only advantage, from this perspective, of being at a lower security place, is that the people you are locked up with are less likely to be insane rapist murderers, and the less time they will be doing so the less likely they are to want to kill or rape you.

And, yes, darling, I was definitely kidding that they should relax and enjoy it. Of COURSE rape, anal or otherwise is a horrific thing and I shouldn&#039;t even really joke about it. I have somewhat of a gallows sense of humour. Of course, I do stand by my assertion that when it&#039;s consensual buttsexs, it&#039;s not so bad.... Well, so long as you&#039;re given some warning, even if it&#039;s someone popping the cap on the lube and telling you to bite the pillow. ;)<br /><br />And thanks for the +1 / RL thumb up the bum fun. I&#039;ve given you one back :D<br /><br />

				@ Remediless..<br />Yeah I was gathering you were just joking but still need a little re-assurance. If only the internet came with a context (in this sense sarcasm) button. I fucking hate emoticons, they&#039;re just not the right kind of tool I need to convey the tone of my conversations. So many times I&#039;ve been misconstrued by people who just don&#039;t understand my sense of humour. It&#039;s probably accountable for 80% of my negative karma on here.&nbsp; Always nice to find someone who can truly appreciate where I&#039;m coming from without further explaination. Thanks for the +1 too btw!!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I know one person who has been raped in prison (Australia). <br /><br />You wouldn&#039;t pick it, 6&#039;1 and not effeminate in the slightest.
