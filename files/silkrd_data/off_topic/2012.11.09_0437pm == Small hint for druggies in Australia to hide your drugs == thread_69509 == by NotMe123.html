				Just a little hint for Aussies who are worried about storing drugs in their house,<br /><br />If you have a spare room in your house you can put a lock on the door and hide whatever you want in there, the catch is to say that you are renting out this room to somebody and the cops are not allowed to search the room.<br /><br />if you are living in a shared house for example and you send drugs to yourself , cops catch it and want to search your house all they can search is your bedroom the garage, lounge room, dinning room basically any shared living space but can only search your room.<br /><br />if billy lives with you and he has a clean record you can put all your drugs in his bedroom and cops are not aloud to search it because if it has your name on the search warrant they can only search your room and public areas of the house.<br /><br />if you live with your parents and siblings(you shouldn&#039;t be using silk road in the first place,lol) you can store the drugs in their room and cops can&#039;t search it, they would need to get a search warrant for every person to search their room.<br /><br />i know someone who used to hide his pounds in his mums room when he was living at home(his mum used to drive him to score when he lost his license), he got raided once and they found nothing because he had it hidden in his mums room and cops weren&#039;t aloud to search her room as the warrant was in his name. <br /><br />he was over 18 at the time so i don&#039;t know if that makes a difference, if the search warrant was in the parents name and the children are under 18 then i think they can search all the rooms but if they are over 18 they can only search the name on the warrant.<br /><br />i have a room that a friend is renting off me and i put all my goodies in a safe in his room with a lock on the door.<br />if cops want to search the room and ask for the key i tell them i am renting out the room and the renter is not home, if they don&#039;t believe me and smash the door down and find my safe they cant charge me or take me to court because it would be an illegal search as the renters name would not be on the warrant, if the decide to scare you and say they will wait in your house till they get the warrant don&#039;t be scared because they would not be granted the warrant if they have nothing on the renter.<br /><br />from my understanding this is the Australian law, not sure how it works overseas.<br /><br />can someone please correct me if&nbsp; i&#039;m wrong but i&#039;m fairly sure this is correct

				I find this very hard to believe. This reminds me of the sage advice to put your drugs in an envelope when your in the car because they can&#039;t open mail. Many people did this and got felony&#039;s for possession and whatever the charge for shipping drugs is. However, I am not familiar with Australian laws. But please, no one try this unless it is ABSOLUTELY confirmed. No offense. <br /><br />I find it even harder to believe the &quot;living with your parents&quot; part. Because technically your room IS their room. You don&#039;t own the house or rent at all.

				If you are getting drugs sent to your house in the mail, the warrant will be for everyone in the house.

				In Victoria, a warrant to search premises for drugs or for evidence of the commission of drug offences can be obtained from a Magistrate by a member of the police force. The Magistrate must be satisfied there are reasonable grounds for the belief that there are drugs on the premises or that drug offences are being committed.<br /><br />The warrant may authorise entry by force if necessary onto the specified premises and search of those premises and of any persons or vehicles found there.<br /><br />So, in Vic at least, I would not follow the OP&#039;s reasoning.&nbsp; You will probably just really really piss off your flatmate.

				I just hide my drugs in my pet wallaby&#039;s pouch. Unless the cops have a warrant specifically for searching little Hoppy they are not allowed by law touch him. It&#039;s because he&#039;s a native species and so protected. This is why it doesn&#039;t work if you say your dog ate your weed - dogs were introduced to Australia.<br /><br />This was all verified to me by a friend who is also high right now.<br /><br />True story.

				It&#039;s misinformation like this that makes the current stance on drug education and the war on drugs so dangerous.<br /><br />What if this wasn&#039;t information on the police activities, what if this was information on the dosing of a drug a user hadn&#039;t tried yet? The sheer amount of misinformation spread that follows drugs is disturbing, especially among young, inexperienced users. <br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you the number of times I&#039;ve heard people spread wrong, and downright dangerous information about drugs, because the only source of information most people have about them is from other people. <br /><br />Do your own research, never put your life and freedom in the hands of other people&#039;s information.
