				There are a bunch of auctions on eBay like this:<br /><br />http://bit.ly/yu5TnJ<br /><br />Title says: Auction is for 1 Bitcoin (BTC) digital currency.<br />So far the bidding is at 3.25usd with 4+ days left and says payment must be verified through PayPal first.<br />HUH??? <br />Last I heard, PayPal wanted nothing to do with bitcoins and doesn&#039;t allow transactions like this right?<br />There seem to be A LOT like this so it must be going through but has anyone here bought a bitcoin off eBay? <br /><br />I have money on PayPal I&#039;ve been dying to trade for bitcoins but I know unless someone really trusts me, it most likely won&#039;t happen &amp; that sux. I actually had 1 person willing to help me out but hasn&#039;t responded after agreeing to do it so that&#039;s that I guess....<br />If I do actually get someone to trade with me, I thought I&#039;d have to hide what was being traded by making it a donation or saying it was a loan payback or something but these auctions aren&#039;t hiding anything about the sale.<br /><br />If the auction was for more than one btc I&#039;d be right on it but most of them are for only 1 to maybe 3 coins and some are selling the<br />&nbsp;physical coins instead of digital. I wonder why these sellers are doing this. Do u get better protection if its an eBay sale? If the one I linked to keeps getting bids and going up that could be good but after eBay/PayPal fees, time it takes to list and then transfer to wallet....would it even be worth selling 1 coin at a time or is there some other benefit to these sellers that I&#039;m missing?<br /><br />What do u guys think?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen those, they normally go for around $10 per BTC. <br /><br />A lot of those 1BTC auctions are being sold as starter kits with info on what to do with them, how to get more, etc. I don&#039;t think people can sustain a BTC selling business on eBay through PayPal, they&#039;re normally people who will do it for a certain period of time and then stop or have only a small part of their business dedicated to selling BTC. <br /><br />I think the selling of BTC&#039;s itself is prohibited so they&#039;ll attempt to sell it as a collector&#039;s item or whatnot. It&#039;s like people scalping tickets by putting up an auction for a blank envelope (with tickets inside).

				I really couldn&#039;t think of a decent reason....even at $10 it still doesn&#039;t seem worth it.

				Yeah I have a feeling people who sell those 1btc are also giving info on how to buy more though NOT through eBay.
