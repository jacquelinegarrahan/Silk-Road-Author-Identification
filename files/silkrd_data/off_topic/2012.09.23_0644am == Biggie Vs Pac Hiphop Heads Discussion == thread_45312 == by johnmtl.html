				Tupac man!&nbsp; why you turn on me, hit em up.&nbsp; Best diss songs ever heard. i love tupac so much because he spoke his mind, didnt give a fuck who was there.&nbsp; i saw a interview where they asked him not to curse. He said &quot;They told me not to curse, FUCK that!&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;Man too man good songs to list.. Lil homies, do for love, Thug passion, I aint mad at ya, .....<br /><br />Biggie is really good too i like his song sky is the limit. but your right, different styles its hard to compare them.

				If i had to choose.. damn this would go down all day.. but<br /><br />&nbsp;i would say pac for his work ethics , he has records on top of records on top of records,,,<br /><br />Biggie go hard, and i think his best work would be Ten Crack Commandments.. Pac would be that song R-U-still down ? (remember me)<br /><br />i say real life wise. Biggie had Pac shot.. and i give props to biggy for havin da balls.. but i give to Pac also for setting up a plan...<br /><br />he has a song called &quot;God Rest the Dead&quot; specifically for that.<br /><br />Ganster Party by Pac shows the story pretty good.. <br /><br />other than that.. Me against the world, and Ready to Die are the albums..<br /><br />other noticeable rappers are. Lil&#039; Boosie.. Max B

				If you wanna get into UK hip-hop, we cannot forget about Giggs (pre big record deal, of course)<br /><br />I listen to more of the UK stuff then US.&nbsp; There is something about the Caribbean influence over there that makes it a bit more exciting.<br /><br />Anyone who knows me IRL, knows that I love my UK beats.

				D Double is a decent MC.&nbsp; As a general rule, when it comes to grime..&nbsp; I prefer pirate/online radio shows where wheel-up&#039;s/rewinds are a bit more on the unpredictable side.<br /><br />I wish I could get the some of the old General LOK and Ivan-o sets they did on raw blaze fm years ago.&nbsp; Very underrated guys those two.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll give this thread back now.&nbsp; Sorry for the hijack, Johnmtl.

				i prefer pac over biggie...but does anyone else think eminem is more lyrically talented than both? obviously his new stuff can&#039;t match his first four albums (yes, even infinite), but after listening to pretty much his entire discography recently, his lyrical genius is pretty much undeniable. and i don&#039;t even listen to rap/hip-hop that much.
