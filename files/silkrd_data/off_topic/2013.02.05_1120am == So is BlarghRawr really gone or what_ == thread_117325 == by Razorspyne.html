				Felt bad making a whole thread to ask this, but......<br /><br />A) BlarghRawr was a long-time hero member, and<br /><br />B) I&#039;ve seen dumber threads made on a daily basis<br /><br />...... so sue me. Just wanted to know what the deal was with a long-time member pulling his account without warning or explanation a few hours ago. <br /><br />All I could find was a recent post on his Reliable Reviewers thread and a recent discussion between him and wasta about wasta&#039;s incorrect accusation mods were profiting off spam busting. He seemed exasperated. (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112789.0)<br /><br />I ignore a % of people as there is a % of snobs and troublemakers on the forum (I said % not all) ..... hell, I notice the way most aren&#039;t noticed until they are practically a senior member, at which point it changes dramatically, and as for trouble-making trolls, we seem to get a new one every day. <br /><br />...........But........ I&#039;m curious to know why vastly unpopular members like Roky Errikson and NoNudes or whatever his name is, continually sit on this forum and troll all day while someone who actually has spent his time helping this ungrateful community grow has just deleted his account.....? Does anyone know why? Did anyone even NOTICE him gone? ???

				So did I. That&#039;s the one I referred to. Try clicking on his name. Then go to the last page of his Reliable Reviewers thread (or any thread he&#039;s posted on). &quot;Guest&quot;. He&#039;s gone.

				Yeah, I think you&#039;re probably right. Very weird, seems totally out of the blue. I wish him the best of luck though, drugs can be wonderful tools to explore your mind, but they can also ruin your life. Perhaps it&#039;s for the best that he takes a break from the SR.<br /><br />BlarghRawr (6:20 am):<br /><br />Quote from: typpertapper on February 03, 2013, 02:17 am<br />&quot;I hope that all of you here who still limit and judge yourselves subconsciously will find the path to unconditional love for yourself.&quot;<br /><br />I found it without LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s also why it says &quot;guest&quot; under my name for this and my 2000 other posts.

				Oh crap, I didn&#039;t see that. I was searching his last posts but b/c he is no longer a member the results are all over the place.<br /><br />IDK, least extensively, why he left (apart from what he wrote just then) but thought he devoted his time constructively to helping the site, and and it&#039;d be rude not to say kudos for that.<br /><br />Sad to see someone like that leave. <br /><br />TY for posting his post lesseroftwoweevils. Kind of fills in a bit of a blank (a bit, not much lol). If he&#039;s reading this, a sound out for his contributions here. Will be missed!&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />

				Damn.. was definitely a good supplement to the world of craptalk that goes on here. I don&#039;t usually take the time to go through a TL;DR save a few members, but I gave Blargh the time n consideration. <br /><br />I see two different types of farewells, those that make it known and want to acknowledge others they found commonalities or those who take the backdoor as to not make a big deal of their departure. I find both commendable and bid the man ado. <br />

				When people leave I try not to look into it too much because more then likely they just switched accounts, it&#039;s just the nature of people in this business and sometimes you just need a break from this, you know how it is...He could be spam busting and just switched accounts to do that as well. Who knows? He could have got his significant other pregnant and is taking care of business in real life now, the possibilities are endless. But it goes without saying if he is gone I&#039;m sure some of you guys will miss him and wish him the best.

				He will be missed, for sure.&nbsp; He had been considering deleting his account for a few days due to some concerns he had, and it looks like he went ahead and did so yesterday.&nbsp; Sent me a nice farewell message, and I&#039;m hoping that maybe one day he&#039;ll be back.&nbsp;

				Just wanted to thank everyone who posted (+K pp 1-2). Bit grumpy in OP..... kinda ruined candlelight mood in here. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=117325.msg795703#msg795703">Quote from: THUMBSuP. on February 05, 2013, 09:45 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">this place isn&#039;t what it used to be..<br />and all BR ever did was help help help.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />.... pretty much going through my head so yeah, not happy at time. Glad to see that BlarghRawr did indeed get noticed.... it was my impression that the good ones seemed to be leaving. Some don&#039;t receive thanks. (They know who they are, and it&#039;s not a short list.)<br /><br />I for one did not overlook BR, he put into this community, many people here saw that (well, SR members not legally blind that is).<br /><br />Can&#039;t really add anything to the other posts. You guys have done it so well. I&#039;m just a guy on the sidelines on this matter, no one really. I didn&#039;t know him like you did. I just asked a question hoping you guys would fill it in with some recognition for him and you have done just that... appreciated. I was peed off at time b/c people who should get credit don&#039;t ever get it. Thank you for proving a cynical member wrong. And to BlarghRawr, who there is a chance hasn&#039;t gone forever, if you happen to read this I just have to say I see how you spent your time on The Road and it was certainly productive and in the right direction.... And everyone who posted on this thread saw that and gave props. And on this forum....... that&#039;s actually hard to do. I won&#039;t say props to the fallen b/c this matter may not be so done and dusted yet. So piece out for the meantime my good man, and serious thanks for helping us. Take a well-earned rest and dude, you certainly deserve one. :)<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.

				No shit Ballz I loved old Blarg but would never let him know that. I learned a shit load from him. To me he stuck out as more than just a buyer or member or whatever. He had some kind of rank with this forum and maybe SR as well.<br /><br />I think he came in as BlarghRawr to accomplish some kind of goal or task that maybe he was charged with. When he accomplished that task he ended his reign as the Blarg and that as they say is that. Honestly man I could not help but shed tears that night when I noticed he had hung it up. I&#039;m getting water eyed right now just thinking of the times and experiences we went thru together on these forums. We had some arguments for sure but there&#039;s another on here that I wouldn&#039;t shed a tear over that argued with me. He just don&#039;t compare to The Blarg tho. BlarghRawr had morals and was honest
