				If you like couch lock and sleepy, then get into edibles. I make a mean ginger snap cookie with purple kush butter and let me tell you. The party never goes past midnight = P

				I would love to make my&nbsp; own edibles but, honestly ordering some cookies baked by someone I don&#039;t know sketches me out.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure its perfectly safe,&nbsp; but i always picture honey boo boo&#039;s mom baking them up.&nbsp; &nbsp; :/<br /><br />I see some cheba chews, but those things are like 20+ dollars a pop.&nbsp; &nbsp;That seems crazy high to me.&nbsp; Would love to try one tho.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the suggestion,&nbsp; &nbsp;good karma went your way.

				edibles will do the trick!! <br />if you don&#039;t want to buy any it&#039;s hella easy to make edibles, if you want, pm me and i&#039;ll give you an easy method&nbsp; ;)<br />as far as herb..<br />it kinda depends on how you personally react to sativas and indicas..<br />if i were aiming for your status, i personally would go for a fruity thai, Green Crack, or Jack Herer.. for me, it&#039;s a sativa dominant strain..<br />to each their own!!&nbsp; 8)<br />hope this helps!!

				May I suggest BashfulBetty&#039;s MJ butter! Definitely made from indica bud.&nbsp; I take about 3.5g (can be eaten straight or spread on cracker/oatcake) for a warm stoned Saturday night buzz :)<br />Very good stuff indeed - and the vendor is great.

				My favorite method of ingesting cannabutter (which is preferably made from Super Afghan or Nepal type hashes, you know, the soft ones with that amazing lavender aroma) is dissolving it in a cup of hot chocolate and drinking it. This method is by far the best if you want to really deliver and experience the aroma of the hash. It tastes fucking out-of-this-world amazing.

				Blueberry<br />Blackberry<br />Afghan hash<br />White Rhino<br />Kush strains<br />Cheese UK exd <br />White Russian<br />Aurora Indica <br />G13<br />Bubba kush<br /><br /><br />Off the top of my head, the best for heavy sleepy type stoned on that list is White Rhino it is great for pain too followed closely by Afghan hash amazing for sleep but not so good for pain.<br /><br />Look for indica dominant strains and you will be good.<br /><br /><br /><br />
