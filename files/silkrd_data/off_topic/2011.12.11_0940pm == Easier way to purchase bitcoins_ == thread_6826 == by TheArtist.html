				The hardest thing about purchasing anything for me on SR is getting a hold of these damn bitcoins. I&#039;ve seen quite a few people posting and complaining about there availability and I haven&#039;t really found a solution. <br /><br />What are a couple of fast/safe methods of exchange?

				Look into get-bitcoin.com<br /><br />I&#039;ve used them a couple times using cash deposits at the bank.&nbsp; Basically you put an purchase order for bitc on their website and then they e-mail you a bank account number to deposit the cash into.&nbsp; Then you go to a Chase or BofA fill out a deposit slip with that bank account number and go to the teller and deposit it (*at my BofA i had to ask the teller for the deposit slip because it was an out of state account).&nbsp; The teller does not ask for any ID or information from you.&nbsp; After you make the deposit you take a picture of the receipt and e-mail to get-bitcoin.com as verification of the deposit.&nbsp; After you e-mail the verification they usually have the bitcoin in my wallet in 2-4 hours (though the site says it can take up to 24).&nbsp; while it&#039;s not the most anonymous way to get bitc I think it&#039;s one of the easiest and fastest without paying through the nose, btw they charge a 5% service fee.

				This is what I did and you all should do the same:<br /><br />Found listing for something I wanted on SR for 14BTC (which equals $44.94). Took $60 to walmart and bought a moneypak card at the money center for $5 and put the remaining $55 on the card. &quot;Bought&quot; a listing for MP to BTC from vendor BTC Buddy and sent him the city/state, the total amount on the card, and the MP number (you have to scratch it off the MP card like a lotto ticket). THE SAME DAY my 14BTC was put automatically to my SR account. Set rating at 5 and gave no less than two sentences for feedback. <br /><br />If you go through BTC Buddy on SR, you&#039;ll never have to worry about anonymity or any other crap that all of the trading companies make you go through. I only use BTC Buddy from now on.

				I would steer clear of any SR bitcoin traders in the wake of the SumYunGai fiasco.&nbsp; He wasn&#039;t the first, and he won&#039;t be the last moneypak thief.<br /><br />Personally, I find I&#039;m least likely to lose my cash if I get money into my Paxum account (several ways to fund it, personally I like to use moneypak to fund a CC for Paxum deposits) and then transfer the Paxum cash to TradeHill to convert to bitcoins.<br /><br />The pitfalls here are that I can&#039;t recall which but either Paxum, TradeHill, or both may ask for a bit too much personal info for your tastes.&nbsp; It also takes a bit longer than handing over a moneypak on faith to a SR vendor, assuming they do pay you BTCs.&nbsp; My own philosophy is that as buying bitcoins is legal, I&#039;m fine with my actual self acquiring them with a paper trail.&nbsp; By the time any illicit substance has been purchased, those bitcoins have tumbled a bit in the washer, you know?

				I&#039;ve been saying to myself for the last 3 weeks on payday (Friday) &quot;This is the time you start your bitcoin purchasing, and you&#039;ll be lifted to shit when the package arrives next week.&quot; but then I always give up when I think about going through it all and just hop down the street and grab something satisfying but not something I want because of ease. Just started reading the Moneypack stuff today and thank god everything is giving props to Sugar Mama, I&#039;m really thinking this is the method for me.

				I understand what you&#039;re getting at Sal, and in a perfect world no one would scam. But I&#039;m looking at it this way (Keep in mind I only make small purchases.), I take a risk with my hobby no matter what, I&#039;m trying to lessen the risk as much as possible and doing it at all this way already decreases it a good amount. I&#039;ve been ripped off on the street many times over and probably will be again, it&#039;s the nature of the beast. I don&#039;t want it to happen, but it does and there is no escrow/refunds/reships or recourse for that either.<br /><br />Is the only real problem with the Moneypack &gt; Bitcoin option the seller trust? Are the coins more traceable that way? Even though I&#039;m impatient I&#039;m still trying to be as healthy paranoid as I can be about all this.

				I just made my first purchase on SR and went the way of dwolla -&gt; bit coin trader -&gt; instawallet washing -&gt; SR account and it took several days for me to be able to make a purchase, the vendor even sold out when I finally got my funds to SR! but luckily re-upped the next day. Even though this method probably takes the longest, it is probably the most secure and after you tumbled your coins through a few wallets, i think probably harder to trace back to you personally. It is definately a pain but a sure way to get your Bitcoins, though if you can&#039;t wait I&#039;m sure a reputable trader like Sugar Mama would be the way to go!

Or you can accept an offer, the other day i ended up paying 30$ for 7,32 coins and then $25 for 6,3 coins. It is really interesting how this currency works...

				Hi,<br /><br />I am not sure what you mean by &quot;real&quot;, if you mean the physical coins, it is described here:<br /><br />https://www.casascius.com/<br /><br />Basically, you get a coin (or bar) with some fancy holograms and a code, that code represents a digital bitcoin, you<br />can convert them into usable BTC via mtgox or other exchange services.<br /><br />The idea is: You provide me with some postal address that you can access without beeing noticed, but that is not<br />directly traceable to you. I will use a creditcard (a stolen one) to buy the coins and have them sent to that address.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br />Stephe
