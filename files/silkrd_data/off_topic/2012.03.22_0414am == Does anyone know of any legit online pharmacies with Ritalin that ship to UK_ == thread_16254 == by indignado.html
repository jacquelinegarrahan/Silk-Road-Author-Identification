				I&#039;ve been taking Ritalin daily (usually 2x10mg per day) for university, basically because I have self-diagnosed myself with ADHD. Now I know self-diagnosis is stupid, but the Ritalin helps immensely, and I never abuse it. Unfortunately, the prices on SR are usually between 2 and 3 GBP for a single 10mg, meaning I&#039;m spending around 150GBP a month,&nbsp; which, as a student is a hell of alot of money. I will hopefully eventually be able to get them cheaper through the NHS but this could take months as the waiting list for psychiatric services is obscene. Without taking Ritalin, it&#039;s sad to say, I&#039;ll probably end up failing. Does anyone know any legit online pharmacy who stock Ritalin or related ADHD medication at a better price, who can ship to the UK?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />indignado

				I&#039;ve also been looking for it, but haven&#039;t found a legit clearnet seller. Most are Pakistan/India pharmacy&#039;s who tend to have OK/good benzo&#039;s, but they&#039;re Ritalin is almost always fake. Would be interested in a genuine seller as well, which doesn&#039;t charge as much as I see around here (as I can&#039;t get them reliably f2f).

				Shaz has fairly cheap generic ritalin and she ships from the UK. From memory the main site (Shaz-steroids.com) doesn&#039;t ship TO the UK for some reason but one of the many sister sites does so just have a dig around a few forums and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find it.<br /><br />Depending on how much you need there are also a few bulk sites that sell them even cheaper but the minimum orders are at least $300 and most of them ship from India. <br /><br />If you find anything cheaper be sure to post in this thread, I&#039;d love a new source.
