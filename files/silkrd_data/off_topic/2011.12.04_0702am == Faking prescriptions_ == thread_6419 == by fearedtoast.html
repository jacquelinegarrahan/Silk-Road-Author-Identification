				Hello Silkroad,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope all of you are having a pleasant evening (almost morning for me...)<br />I recently purchased a number of fake, printable prescription pads.&nbsp; They&#039;re the exact same as a normal doctor&#039;s prescription pad, but I can edit the address of the business, phone numbers, etc before printing it out in color and then writing out exactly what I&#039;d like prescribed.<br /><br />I see the obvious risks of the pharmacy phoning in the doctor, and plan to replace the phone number with that of a friend (or myself after I wander away), as well as that they may be doubtful of the medication needed (I plan to write out a rx for vicodin 7.5/750.)&nbsp; I have a crutch and cast that I can borrow from a friend, and obviously won&#039;t be using medical insurance.&nbsp; Would I need to use a fake ID as well?&nbsp; <br /><br />This is quite a bit to ask, but any advice is more than welcome.&nbsp; I&#039;m hesitant to attempt this unless I&#039;m fairly sure that no pigs will be crowding into the pharmacy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				Nice post mrgrey. That is some valuable advice. Someone was offering doctors scripts in the product section and I called him out on a number of things you mentioned, since I didnt want anyone to lose money and likely end up in jail...

				Besdies everything else that has been mentioned that is factual about what&#039;s needed to pull of a heist like yours, be sure you smile alot cause from moment you drop of script and then attempt to pick it up, you&#039;ll be on Candid Camera as further proof of the 7 to 8 Federal Crimes they will nail you on.

				Once again, thank you for the advice :)<br /><br />The harshness of your replies has convinced me to abandon this endeavor...&nbsp; At least until I get a fake ID.

				Usually people get away with this once or twice, but they eventually get caught. When/if you get away with it your first time, it will be easier to do the second. I dont know of one person who has been able to do this and not eventually get caught...

				Fuck all that acetaminophen. Do an extraction or rot your liver out. Get some Percs 5/325 instead. <br />I wouldn&#039;t have the balls to try it but good luck if you do.

				Unfortunately, opiates have gotten so incredibly popular and mainstream, in last 10 years, that even legit scripts are seen as suspicious, and nobody I know who&#039;s attempted to scam pharmacists has had any kind of lasting success, even back before it was common.&nbsp; And, as CP said, you get away with it, you&#039;ll do it again, and eventually you fall.&nbsp; I&#039;d check out opiophile.org, you want to look into this kind of activity, as they have lengthy credible posts about this very subject, and it always ends badly.&nbsp;

				Probably have a better chance getting away with robbing the pharmacy, which you would likely get away with once.

				Enjoy your stay in jail<br /><br />Most (well all) pharmacies, even bitter rivals have an interconnected network of open information on suspicious scripts.&nbsp; They fill so many that it&#039;s pretty easy to spot a questionable script.<br /><br />If you plan on using a fake phone # you better be prepared to know various number&#039;s relating to the (fake) doctor&#039;s (who you made up) license and practice, as well as be familiar with formulations, brands, etc.<br /><br />Furthermore, if you don&#039;t know the latin to writing a script already ... do you really think it&#039;s in your best interest to try?<br /><br />Having just said all that i&#039;m going to be extremely hypocritical in telling you some of the more common latin acronyms/phrases used.&nbsp; This is for educational purposes, like I said in my first sentence, enjoy your stay in jail if you plan on attempting anything like this.<br /><br />Mitte and Sig are the two ... well primary part&#039;s of a script, Mitte means quantity, sig means instructions, typically the script will just say M: 60 <br />S: blah blah.&nbsp; OD means once daily, BID means take twice daily, TID (3 times), QID (4 times), PRN means when needed for pain, CF means with food.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are comprehensive lists of latin prescription abbreviations on the internet.<br /><br />Honestly though dude, I think pretty much everyone that has commented in this thread has told you not to do such a stupid thing, yet your still asking how to do it.&nbsp; It won&#039;t matter if it&#039;s Adderall or a narcotic, fraud is fraud bro (there will be less charges, but still jailtime and a record if you don&#039;t already have one).&nbsp; You MIGHT (unlikely though) get away with it once if you know how to write a script (which you said you don&#039;t), but it typically won&#039;t take long before your caught.&nbsp; If you want to go to prison so bad, I dunno smash a store shop window or something.&nbsp; Why do you persist in asking how to do something that pretty much everyone has unanimously stated to you will get you into trouble?&nbsp; SR has plenty of vendors who sell prescription drugs you know?
