				I&#039;m looking to purchase a pill presser.<br /><br /><br />What should I look for in one specification wise?<br /><br />I want to use it for ecstasy pills but I don&#039;t want them to fall apart so what should I look for when purchasing one?

				Sounds good to me I was planning to spend around 2k for one but that seems great.<br /><br />It has enough pressure to make a good pill that will hold together right? I shouldn&#039;t be worried about it falling apart within the week or anything?<br /><br />Also has anyone had any experience with one of these such as engraving and making custom dies because on the site it says that there custom dies don&#039;t fit that model but you could engrave it yourself not sure how but would be a nice read if anyone would want to explain.

				Don&#039;t bother with a press unless your willing to spend upwards of 3500+ Anything worse than a tdp 6 will produce shit pills unless you have a custom motor. I set up a tdp 1 with a golf cart motor once it produced hard pills but their where constant problems with stalling and other things.<br />If you don&#039;t have experience working with electronics and machinery don&#039;t order from china. They have terrible quality control, I have ordered tones of presses from china to resell they always have issues.<br />Look for a reseller in the UK or the USA. Buy from an established seller

				alright so the lfatablet press is not going to work I just saw the outcome and they look like tums after the pills pressed it doesn&#039;t even look like a normal x pill.<br /><br /><br />As for engraving it&#039;s going to have to be done in order to establish a reputation for that pill, blanks are just to much harder to sell.<br /><br /><br />So any suggestions on a pill press that&#039;s under 2k ?

				TDP/lfa presses works fine.... Just because some one made a video of their shit pills only means they can&#039;t operate the press. The tdp 5 has like 50kn of force. If you set the fill depth correctly and the ejection height it produces good pills if you don&#039;t fix that stuff it wont compress tight. Theirs 10000s of companies in china also that will make custom dies.
