				This is why I&#039;m scared of LSD / strong psychedelics.<br />I have taken Ketamine &amp; MDA which I have enjoyed but only once taken 1/2 tab LSD.<br />I&#039;m just too nervous to go down this road after I heard a story from a friend who had a bad NBOMe trip who said it was the worst time of his life by a huge margin.<br />He said it felt like forever and he was in a terrible mood for days after as well. So I am a bit hesitant to try these drugs, but I would still like to work my way up to it.

				I had something similar, a few months ago I ate about 4 tabs at once and couldn&#039;t move after I started peaking. I was sitting down, sinking into a chair in my living room staring at ONE spot on my wall for 4 hours while the walls were breathing, random 3d shapes and lines were floating around in the air, the lighting in the room was changing colors and the floor was bubbling and wobbling. <br /><br />Every time I tried communicating with my sitter I was not able to speak properly and I would say very scrambled sentences that made no sense (like &quot;yah, yah, I feel good not, bad no yah, yah bad&quot;). I got very embarrassed and alarmed at the same time that I was not able to speak and thought I must have looked like an idiot (just trip anxiety though :P). It was very frustrating to not be able to say I couldn&#039;t move though.<br /><br />I was literally not able to speak to him so I had to summon all the strength in my body and raise my hand to give him thumbs up when he did eventually get concerned. Then I would just drop my arm and go back to staring at the wall with NO THOUGHTS AT ALL going through my head. Just a fuck-load of visual hallucinations (the likes of which Ive only seen ONCE on my first NBOMBe trip), and a lost ego.<br /><br />Hardest Ive ever tripped in my life on LSD. Made me realize just how fucking powerful it is. At one point I thought each of my eyes was its own head and I was seeing out of two entirely different heads (hard to explain). My vision split completely in two while I was staring at the wall, and a dark void appeared in the middle of the room.<br /><br />As I said though, the only thing that made it a BAD trip was that I couldn&#039;t fucking talk/communicate properly. I enjoyed the colorful, shape filled fuckfest appearing right in front of me 8)

				Once I just dropped 3 tabs of LSD with a girl and it started raining, so we decided to put on swimming clothes and walk down the street to the rainforest to have sex. It turned out to be a really good idea even though it was super cold and muddy because having sex on LSD while lying in mud was a weird but enjoyable experience.<br /><br />On the walk home it was bucketing down and the trip starting coming on very strong, I was getting very intense visuals and I felt like the air was made of jelly and it took a massive effort to push myself through it. As I walked in the door I saw a huge spider dangling from a web but I brushed it off as part of the trip and entered my house.<br /><br />Suddenly I had a massive stinging pain on the top of my head and as I brushed my hand over my hair the spider came off onto the floor, it was real!<br /><br />We caught it under the cup and I was staring at it freaking out as it looked ridiculously massive on my trip and my head was feeling swollen and sore. The acid trip and spider bite was not a good combination and my thoughts were going in weird loops where I&#039;d start thinking I was going to die and I&#039;d try and reassure myself that I wasn&#039;t but I couldn&#039;t convince myself that everything would be OK.<br /><br />The acid was still getting stronger and I started seeing bars on my windows and shadows of people walking around outside. I was in my room and peeked under my door and I swear I could see prison guards walking around my house. I was getting really claustrophobic and thought I was in jail at the same time as I was freaking out about the spider.<br /><br />Then the girl I was with started freaking out too and crying and going on about how she loved her dad but she thought he was a loser because he drove trains for a living and flew to Thailand every year and she thought that he went there to fuck hookers as he&#039;d never dated a girl since her mum divorced him. She was going on and on about her family problems and crying and I didn&#039;t know what to do as I was too concerned with looking out the window and under the door checking for guards while being concerned about the intense pain in my head.<br /><br />That&#039;s when I realized that another 10 minutes of being in prison with a spider bite and a crying girl and I was going to have some kind of psychotic episode and lose my marbles completely. Something drastic had to be done.<br /><br />I went to the fridge, grabbed some GHB I had and prepared 2 doses in separate cups strong enough to knock us both out. My hands were shaking, I was sweating and had anxiety through the roof as I carefully tried to measure the right doses. After remeasuring like 5 times I was confident I had it right so we both downed the Fanta and lay down in bed.<br /><br />The next thing I remember was waking up about 5 hours later. I was still tripping but a lot less intense and the anxiety was gone. The girl woke up a little after me and she felt better as well, but the after effects of the bad trip lingered with us both for days.<br /><br />I went and looked at the spider in the cup the next day too, it was nowhere near as big as it seemed while I was tripping :)

				I have never had a bad LSD trip per-se, but if I take two doses in the same week very close to each other I sometimes regret taking the second dose as I get very minimally high and just a headache usually. Being sort of high on LSD due to tolerance sucks, you are just high enough that you cannot think straight but not high enough that you get any significant value out of it. So my worst LSD trip would have to be one of the times I dosed back to back without having enough time in between.

				Once I was tripping in the park with a very good friend of mine, and everything was going great, visuals were getting unreal until we smoked a couple fat joints. <br />We got so high and the trip became very cloudy till we couldn&#039;t even communicate with each other.<br /><br />That&#039;s when bad thoughts started rushing through my head. I imagined every one knew we were too fucked up because I was seeing my friend walking like a disabled person and staring at everything.<br />Then little by little every single person in that park looked like a physically and mentally disabled person, and I was asking myself why the fuck am I picturing things like this.<br />What&#039;s the message lucy was trying to show me?<br /><br />I started to believe that everyone was here to get me because everyone was giving me nasty looks.<br />My friend, who is one of my best friends and I trust him with my life started scaring me too because visuals got so strong I couldn&#039;t even tell it was him, I was seeing monsters.<br />Thank god I kept hearing his voice from time to time and remembered it was him and everything good he&#039;s done for me in the past.<br /><br />After a lot of struggling I said fuck it, whatever happens will happen and I let go.I accepted my fate. <br />That&#039;s when things started getting better. 30 minutes later I was able to talk to my friend and we decided to go home. He was actually having a good time but he could tell I wasn&#039;t okay.<br />Thing is on acid you cannot discuss shit when peaking, and I didn&#039;t want to give him bad ideas so I wouldn&#039;t ruin his trip.<br />But to me that peak was not tripping, it was more like struggling. I learned not to do +500 micrograms again in public places while smoking weed.<br /><br />Nowadays, when I trip, I always have xanax in my pocket.<br />Even though I&#039;ve never used it myself for ending a badtrip - I never had another one since&nbsp; ;), I&#039;ve given it to a couple friends to help them get out tough moments when they asked me to.<br />It just make me feel good to know that I can almost end the trip whenever I want, and that&#039;s why it wasn&#039;t scary since.<br /><br />For people who&#039;ve had bad trips and still have not fully recovered, do yourself a favor and buy some xanax (even if you won&#039;t take it). It&#039;s just good to know you have a solution if bad loops happen to start.<br /><br />Bad trip are part of acid trips, and to be honest, even if they&#039;re scary, you get them for a reason and you learn much (if not the most) about yourself and the world around you because you have a 1000 idea rushing through your brain in order to get you out of there. <br /><br /><br /><br />

My hands were shaking, I was sweating and had anxiety through the roof as I carefully tried to measure the right doses. After remeasuring like 5 times I was confident I had it right so we both downed the Fanta and lay down in bed.<br /><br />The next thing I remember was waking up about 5 hours later. I was still tripping but a lot less intense and the anxiety was gone. The girl woke up a little after me and she felt better as well, but the after effects of the bad trip lingered with us both for days.<br /><br />I went and looked at the spider in the cup the next day too, it was nowhere near as big as it seemed while I was tripping :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />AWESOME! but damn why she gotta hate on train the drivers&nbsp; :( .. my old man was a train driver and I thought it was awesome and still do. It&#039;s one of the hardest jobs to get where I&#039;m from and with at least 5 extremely difficult examinations competing against thousands that apply during each intake. It&#039;s now a 100k+ a year job even in your first year with the overtime. <br /><br />Anyways luckily and touch wood I&#039;ve never had a seriously bad trip personally but I&#039;ve witnessed them in friends and they don&#039;t look fun at all. I witnessed one trip of a close friend and veteran tripper I&#039;ve known for many years completely go off his rocket believing everything he thought was real actually wasn&#039;t. He was literally convinced I along with all his friends and everyone he knew was just a figment of his imagination which he made up and none of us really existed so yeah that was an odd night indeed. I&#039;ve also witnessed a first timer want the trip to end because it was just too much for him to handle so thinking he could exercise the LSD out of him he immediately dropped down onto the kitchen floor and began doing push ups as fast and as hard as he could which obviously doesn&#039;t work. Now I know it&#039;s strict LSD etiquette to help each other through bad trips and I always try to but being as high as I was as well I just couldn&#039;t help but die of laughter at his futile attempt but he did eventually tire himself into exhaustion and passed out. Lastly slightly off the subject of LSD but still sort of relevant I&#039;ve had another friend get sent to a mental health facility for two weeks after taking 8 grams of shrooms and losing his psyche. Usually this friend and I would always do a maximum of 4 grams each in a shroom session and it always turned out to be great nights but I think he just pushed the limits a little too far doing 8 grams that one time. <br /><br /><br />Edit: A few tips that I&#039;ve used help the chances that I don&#039;t have a bad trip would be to make sure you are going to be dropping in a safe environment for starters. If it&#039;s with other people make sure you can trust them with your life so preferably keep it to just close friends you&#039;ve known for a long time. Also I recommend tripping in a clean environment so example if you are dropping at home ensure the house is clean. If you got dirty clothes and dishes everywhere clean that shit up before you drop acid. Try to drop with a positive frame of mind but if you begin to feel the creep of a bad trip start to formulate what I&#039;ve personally found works for me is I&#039;ll constantly remind myself that I&#039;ve just taken a very potent substance and if it&#039;s going to turn bad I&#039;m not going to fight against it but rather let nature take it&#039;s course and embrace a possible bad trip while I carefully evaluate why this is potentially happening and what lessons I can take from the experience because more times than not there usually is a lesson or multiple ones to be gained. Remember LSD strips ego like paint stripper strips paint off a wall so if you&#039;ve been treating people like shit it&#039;s going to hit you hard on LSD and you&#039;ll be in a world of hurt from those actions so trying to be a better/person in general will help prevent a possible future bad trip. But yeah so far for me this method of embraceful thinking has thankfully turned any potential nasty experience back into a positive one so once again don&#039;t fight bad trips! embrace and learn from them and hopefully the rest will work itself out :)<br /><br />

				The only thing close to a bad trip I&#039;ve had was when I dosed unexpectedly high.&nbsp; Me and a friend headed out to the countryside and drank some liquid acid mixed with strong liquor.<br /><br />I realised about 10 minutes after drinking it that we&#039;d taken a lot more than I&#039;d intended!&nbsp; We were waiting on a taxi outside a supermarket and the world was warping in the most bizarre way, and worse of all I felt unbelievably ill.&nbsp; The thought came to me &quot;shit, I think I&#039;m embarking on one of these fabled &#039;bad trips&#039;.&nbsp; &nbsp; I forced myself to throw up with people watching on, and eventually got a taxi and headed to our &#039;destination&#039; (lol).<br /><br />I had to get the taxi to drop us at the side of the road as I thought I might throw up.&nbsp; We wandered to a stream in a field where things got outrageously intense.&nbsp; So much so that I became confused as to why/how I&#039;d got into this horrible situation.&nbsp; All I could think was that I had poisoned myself with drugs and was nearing close to death, in the middle of nowhere, full of shame and sudden realisation of all my flaws.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t comprehend what one should do if they&#039;re dying.&nbsp; I was asking my friend vague things like ...hospital..?&nbsp; help?.., I was being annihilated on the spot and threw up as violently as I can remember in my life.<br /><br />I must have at some point accepted my inevitable death, or whatever was happening to me.&nbsp; After throwing up I sat cross legged on the spot for a long time and the experience changed.&nbsp; It was like I had been freed.&nbsp; I underwent some crazy realisations of what life was, who we are and all that jazz, :)<br /><br />The rest of the trip was pretty beautiful and as I lay in bed that night (we miraculously made it home), I got the sense that all is right in the universe, it always unfolds as it should, all things fitting into place, and ultimately our lives are divine storytales, pain and suffering are illusory and simply part of the cosmic tapestry that is life.&nbsp; Pretty lovely stuff.<br /><br />I guess this demonstrates the saying that you learn the most from bad trips!&nbsp; Thanks for reading :)<br />
