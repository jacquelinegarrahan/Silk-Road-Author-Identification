				Hey guys,<br /><br />So i&#039;m going to roll for the first time with my lady friend who hasn&#039;t ever rolled either. We are planing on just chilling, talking, opening up, and listening to music at my place, maybe a little sexah time. We both are experienced trippers though. I was wondering which one you guys recommended top roll on first MDA or MDMA. Is there any positives or negatives to rolling on one of them vs the other?&nbsp; I was pretty set on picking up half a G of DReaMensioN&#039;s MDA but then when I looked up MDA vs MDMA on the clearweb some people were saying it was better for a rave environment then what im going for. Thoughts? Experiences? recommendations? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks!

				MDMA is amazing for dancing / partying or chilling out. It gives you a lot of energy and clears your head, but it&#039;s a different kind of energy than Amphetamine gives you.<br />Personally I live stimulants and being full of energy, so I enjoy 10mg high quality amphetamine with MDMA. It just gives me that bit more energy and makes me feel even better. Too much speed though will overpower and kill t he MDMA roll.<br /><br />MDA I&#039;ve only tried once (from Dreamension - Awesome vendor all round). It was nothing like MDMA really. It had some similarities. It made me happy, but it made me want to sit down and close my eyes and see things. Cannabis really intensified the visuals too. I closed my eyes and just smiled and saw colours and shapes. I could think of something and I would see it. I could control what I saw. I really liked it. I haven&#039;t been very far down the psychedelic path yet, but this was the best visual experience I had ever had.<br /><br />MDA didn&#039;t &quot;open me up&quot; in the way that MDMA did though. MDMA enables me to talk to anybody and they feel like they&#039;re my best friend.<br />MDA made me not to social. But everybody reacts differently. My first MDMA experiences were my best ever experiences with drugs. Unimaginable, intense happiness and everything was just amazing and perfect. <br /><br />Whatever you do, enjoy yourself. You won&#039;t regret it.

				MDMA for your first time, it&#039;s always the best. When your more experienced i&#039;d start to mix MDA with MDMA for a face melting experience.<br /><br />Dance, dance, dance.. MDMA was made for this!

				Im compelled to disagree with DAMD there. <br /><br />Though the &#039;A&#039; in MDMA, is infact amphetamine, pure mdma, on its own, will not give you any energy. Quite the contrary in almost every case. It will keep you mellowed the fuck out. Eyes closed more than theyre open, then after your peak, yawn, yawn, yawn,yawn, sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;Unless of coarse your fully rested before rolling, in which case, youll just slowly roll to a sober base line, and wish you had more.lol<br /><br />I would suggest MDMA for your first roll, or hell, even both. The MDA ive never seen as a spectacular &#039;stand alone&#039; drug. When pressed with a pill, or loaded into a MDMA cap, with a few mg of 2cb and meth.. Now thats rolling! hehe. Best of luck.<br /><br />PS i hope you and the lady friend are comfy with e.o. There may be some to a lot of vomiting and or explosive shitting going on, lmao. Also, good luck keeping your cock hard when loaded with MDMA. Much love

On MDMA I am comfortable sitting or standing. But I dose MDMA with Amphetamine as well to give me that extra boost of energy when partying.
