				First of all, I have access to vyvanse and purple kush. I would like to sell here. I&#039;m low on money atm and will have to save up to buy a seller account, and at this point I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s even worth my time. I wish I had set up an account back when it was free or bought one when it was cheaper. I&#039;m sure after getting started up I could make a lot of money with the purple kush if I could get a good reputation going and the vyvanse would be nice to sell as well.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been here for over a year, made dozens of purchases and have almost spent a grand. That&#039;s nothing compared to some people, but I understand packaging and communication quite well.<br /><br />Is it against the rules to ask around for completely unused vendor accounts? I understand that I can&#039;t sell on here until I have an account, but I remember a time where you could talk about dormant vendor accounts and the mods wouldn&#039;t bother you too much.
