				So I was always a traditional ingestor of drugs. Either bomb it, eat it, smoke it or in a drink. No needles always a rule for me. I was then told by numerous people that the best way was to &quot;Shelf it&quot;...stick it up the arse. I was told it was quick and less hassle than normal ways. Escpecially when referring to MDMA. So after refraining for years i reached the point where just the thought alone of sniffing or eating Mandy made me heave! I decided to give it a go, lo and behold to my girlfriends amusement i dabbed my finger in the bag then stuck it up the coolo. Since then if i wanna get high quick without waiting for a bomb to disolve in the stomach the shelf is the way. <br /><br />Just wondering does anyone else partake in shelving? Its a subject that has come up at many raves and people seem quite keen on it for numerous other drugs!

				I have snorted Molly, and gagged, choked, and almost puked. Then I have stomach bombed wrapped in TP, not a problem, same come up as taking a capsule. Can&#039;t say it appeals to me to shove it up my ass, though. Turds are to be burgled, and I am not stashing anything up me bum, except when I am smuggling some turds to the toilet. I have also smoked Molly, as it is a form of meth...whoo what can I say, only the high was not as long lasting as eating it. Still, all the ways to do molly, up the arse is out, for me.
