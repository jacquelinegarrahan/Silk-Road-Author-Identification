				Hypothetically do you think LE would start a vendor account, send out samples and then bust people? Im guessing even if they did no arrests would happen until a real paid order was placed. What do you guys think?

				Too much work, too little profit fine wise. It would take hundreds of arrests for it to be financially plausible for LE. Think about it.

				I&#039;ve thought of that before, but I don&#039;t think its plausible. LE would want the big time stuff, not some guy getting a small, personal amount. LE wants satisfaction of busting people. They would be proud if they got a big name and probably try to get as much attention as possible. But for a couple little samples? I feel like they&#039;d be ashamed haha

				Just remember if you ever get busted shut up and dont say anything and a half-decent laywer could get you off the hook with entrapment or something.<br /><br />LE is scumbags and i wouldnt put it past them if they got desperate but, theres a lot of drugs on the street and they kinda &#039;know&#039; the drug war is lost and we are the good guys not scoring smack in the ghetto, they leave us (users) be for the most part

				It&#039;s always in my mind when I order a sample from a new vendor, but realistically speaking it&#039;s far too much effort with a potentially small reward, and I&#039;ve never heard of it happening on here.

				Doesn&#039;t seem plausible... the busts would be minimal, extremely costly, criticized, and they would probably have trouble proving them just based on an address

				I Agree with those saying its just not worth, setting up an account to send small samples then bust u.. <br /><br />Its not like you know any of the ppl real info on SR and if they grab u they could gain any real info.. <br /><br />They wanna bee able to get people years of jail time, not a few yearrs probation/drug class;s or even a month in county..<br /><br />Prison is a business/cope ration , the longer u get the more money they get.. In my state every inmate that goes through the system, the state gets around close to 40 grand per inmate.. sO I wouldnt worry about ordering a sample,<br /><br />Unless u r a big timer, testing the sample, with intent to later buy fucking KIlo&#039;s an shit, which imo, NEVER ORDER THAT MUCH DOPE THROUGH THE MAIL..<br /><br />Iv never order&#039;d more than i can claim as personal use, at least in one order..

				When small amounts get caught in the mail, people will usually only get a love letter. If LE doesn&#039;t care enough to do a controlled delivery over small amounts they already found, they probably don&#039;t care enough to go through the extra work making an account and doing a controlled delivery over some samples.

				I won a free sample when SR was down and was scared about this as well.&nbsp; I debated on whether or not to claim because I thought it was fishy that someone was giving away free stuff!!&nbsp; I know this is sort of different because whoever gave away was an established forum member, however I was still kinda skeptical.&nbsp; It did turn out to be legit and I was glad I got rid of my paranoia and got what was coming!&nbsp; I think that if you use your instincts that you&#039;ve been using for all this time before SR then you will be okay.&nbsp; If you are just out for free stuff like a fiend, your chances of anything negative are higher.<br />

				I know for sure there policemen and women who buy off SR. Steroids are big, but the police are no different to anyone insomuch as using drugs.<br /><br />As for LE, I think it would be easy to set up an account, but all they could do is offer free samples or set up multiple fake buys for feedback. It is an offence to approach an officer to buy drugs but if the police offer them, its a difficult one for the law.<br /><br />And people who go for free samples are not going to be much of a bust. Many may have nothing at home, the warrent would be issued I guess but the only reason such an operation might be carried out is more to scare off people, to publicise that 100 customers of Silk Road have been busted. If too many free samples are offered out then I&#039;d steer clear. Remember that the police need publicity in the &#039;war on drugs&#039; and they often make petty arrests in my area of local youth who have tiny amounts of bud. The jails are filled with maybe 90% people who were either using or selling drugs, or stealing to fund habits.<br /><br />The police could also buy listings off vendors and trace the post office that is being used. For the big vendors, going into a post office is dangerous as the CCTV in there is very good! <br /><br />So, I think its possible that you could be busted for ordering a small sample. This of course depends on your own nations laws.

				no way. its too much time and effort. plus you would have to involve so many jurisdictions and different levels of law enforcement around a country, it just seems like a lot of work to nail someone for .1g sample. plus i think you would still have to do controlled deliveries to actually make an arrest. thats even more man power needed. i dont think anyone would accept a free delivery for a point anyways.
