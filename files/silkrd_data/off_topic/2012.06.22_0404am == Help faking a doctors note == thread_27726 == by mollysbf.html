				I need help faking a Dr&#039;s note that says my wife had surgery and can&#039;t work for 2 weeks. Not needing anyone to make it for me but to maybe just point me in the right direction of how to go about this. She actually is having surgery but only needs one week off to rest but we are trying to make it to electric forest so we need it to say 2 weeks instead of one lol...

				I know what Canadian prescriptions looks like but for the others .. this is a pretty hard question to answer. If this is for giving to her boss you can easily fake one i think they won&#039;t check really, but this imply insurance fraud.. at least where i live when a doctor say you are not able to work for like 1 months salary insurance give you a part of your salary for that period. Remember that insurance company work hard to catch people that fraud the system.. maybe it&#039;s not like that in other countries, i can&#039;t tell !

				Hmm... Well in America where I live I always just went in and asked for a note and the lady at the desk would actually write it after she called the doctor. <br /><br />Just use the one week then before it is up have her go in and say she needs another, because she isn&#039;t fully recovered. They are usually pretty nice about it if you seem honest.

				I won&#039;t say what I do per se for a living... but lets say I am involved in the medical field.&nbsp; This is seriously SUPER simple, a place that I know of they use SUPER simple, printed in word format doctors note that is nothing spectacular in design.&nbsp; All you need is google, a printer, a fake phone # and a brain.<br /><br />Step 1:&nbsp; Google a doctor, in any area, pull up their web page.&nbsp; Find their logo, right click copy to clip board.&nbsp; <br />Step 2:&nbsp; Open Microsoft word, paste logo as the header, bottom, I don&#039;t care where you put it<br />Step 3:&nbsp; First line state: (Fancy word art may be significant)&nbsp; :&nbsp; Certificate to Return to Work<br />Second line / paragraph:&nbsp; To Whom It May Concern ________________________<br />__________ has recently visited our office at ______________ and has undergone a Surgical procedure.&nbsp; Due to circumstances of the procedure _____________ will not be able to return to Work until / period of time _______2 weeks__________ . <br /><br />Dr. _________<br />Phone :&nbsp; &nbsp;Make up a fake phone number to one of your friends or even your husband they don&#039;t know about, make sure your voicemail doesn&#039;t have you on it duhhhhh.<br />Date:&nbsp; ____<br /><br />FAKE SIGNATURE<br /><br />Logo / fake address <br /><br />Wallah, you are off of work for 2 weeks, enjoy.&nbsp;

				Yah, that is what I thought that you could easily do something like that, but going to your doctor and asking is just as easy.

				I have never had a doctor have to write down a special ID number for a sick note. Also if you already have one for a week then shouldn&#039;t his number be on that one?

				Trust me, you do NOT NEED the physicians LICENSE #.&nbsp; What will your company do with that ??? Do a background check lol, it&#039;s for writing prescriptions or government agencies.&nbsp; A simple, fake doctors note will work wonders.

				I know that I don&#039;t need the physicians number and I am not worried about the insurance company because we aren&#039;t trying to screw them out of any money. The biggest issue with asking for the note is that she won&#039;t have surgery til the day we get back from the festival so I neeed the note a week before the surgery, which I doubt the doctor will give her but I can have her try I guess. I was really hoping that someone on here would have a old hospital discharge paper laying around I could use for formatting

				You tried asking the doc? Most are quite obliging in the UK ime, just get your missus to tell them she is normally slow to heal and can she have 2 weeks? I normally used some BS like that when I was a wage slave.
