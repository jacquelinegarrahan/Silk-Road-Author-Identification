				So I wanted to make this my last post and my first post. My last meaning this is the last time you will see whistleBlower make a post. And by first I mean...this is the first post I am telling the truth!<br /><br />When I came to SR it was with good intentions. No great intentions. I was going to come here, buy a vendor account and start selling Roxicodone among other pills. I was going to be RICH! I just knew it. So I searched for the biggest and best sellers of Roxicodone and looked for vendors had the best reputation and feedback. And I figured I would go after them. What I mean by that is I would create an account (this one) and I would stir up a bunch of shit on the forums about the vendors then I would open shop, with lower prices and take over the market.<br /><br />So I did just that. I chose RxKing and Modziw as targets. It go&#039;s without saying that both were pretty easy to find. Both had great feedback, were well liked and happen to sell the pill in the market I was going to take over. So I created this name and I went on my way of attacking the competition, so I thought. <br /><br />I actually first thought I had something big. I had something that would change the community. That is why I made this name up. It turns out it was nothing. It also turns out that after you huff and puff that and huff and puff again you actually need to blow out some information. The problem is I had nothing to blow(insert joke here). but the way these forums worked. I soon realized that if I just waited a day or two. Yes that short of time, then I could make some more post that really had nothing in them but people would read and would be curious and in fact would start the buzz. I just promised them something soon, that soon came and gone and all I had to do is start it over and no one would be the wiser. They would even reply on my thread and run with &quot;ideas&quot; of who it is and what it is. It was actually pretty funny.Because I knew there was nothing.<br /><br />One of the threads here -----http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=135708.msg921997#msg921997----- was about price fixing and the cartel. Boy did that work out great for me. I could not believe it.&nbsp; Except for the thread got deleted. I was going to talk about all the big drugs and how there was a huge scandal going on. And of course I had no proof of anything. But I learned in here fast that you do not need proof. You just need to say things and use &quot;US&quot;&quot;WE&quot; &quot;EVERYONE&quot;&nbsp; and then&nbsp; just say things that sound good. And sure enough with this topic, everyone is interested because who does not want lower prices! And when you use words like &quot;CARTEL&quot; people want to read. I even got DPR himself to write about it. OOPS ￼<br /><br />So when my thread got deleted I was deflated. And bummed out. It became a HUGE topic as most of you all know and I believed it would start a revolution in here and then of course people would come to the &quot;new guy&quot; with the lower prices who is not part of the cartel/price fix. But all was for nothing as the post was deleted and the buzz went away.<br /><br />The one thing I learned though, is how you do not need any real information. And if it &quot;sounds good&quot; and you say some loaded things, you will get attention, EVEN DPR HIMSELF!! to read your threads. It also created sub threads where people went off on what a cartel is and debated if there could even be a cartel. All the while I was kicking back and laughing at all the drama I created. So know I knew. It is just like the tabloids. And the title is the picture. So make sure I had a juicy title since there are no pictures and I could use the fact my thread was deleted to help my next &quot;attack&quot;<br /><br />So I named it-----&nbsp; &nbsp; *Very* Serious Scandal : Will be blowing the whistle <br /><br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142916.0<br /><br />The &quot;very&quot; was a nice touch if I don&#039;t say so myself. If&nbsp; you read the OP you will see where I talk about the &quot;cartel&quot; and my last post and I said &quot;we&quot;... &quot;all of us&quot; ...&quot;everyone&quot; and I just for lack of better words...sold the shit out of it! Here it is so you do not have to search....<br /><br />Ok, so we blew the whistle off the &quot;price fixing&quot;/&quot;Cartel formation&quot; scandal that had people in an uproar and had a lot of vendors with egg on their face. And we were right. We have little birdies everywhere.<br />Now, we are debating whether to blow the whistle on a few very serious events that have been going on around here. On one hand it could cause a bigger uproar then the last whistle blowing we did.. and not sure if the minions would be able to even do damage control with a straight face. On the other hand, we have a moral responsibility.. as there;s a lot of trust in the integrity of the team/leadership/security/anonymity of this place. Suffice it to say it&#039;s been keeping us up at night. Are debating the pros and cons. But this is not sensationalism folks. This is some serious shit.. and if when we blow the lid off this, eyes will pop. We&#039;re just debating within our own team how to do it delicately. Stay tuned.<br /><br />Whistle Blower<br /><br />WOW, I just read it again and I almost believed it! The &quot;we&quot;&nbsp; is me. And if you really read it, you will see I say nothing.Absolutely nothing. But in here with so many people wanting juice,Btw much like the real world with TMZ and all the fake reality, I was doing the same thing. I was just giving people what they wanted to hear. And at the time I wrote this I had nothing. But I knew that if I wrote a OP like this, that soon people would start to speculate and it would hopefully turn into a game of telephone. And if you look, I got 4 pages worth. And if you notice there are a lot of post from me as every time this thread would fall off of the first page, I would post something.<br /><br />If you notice, one of my targets, Modziw, caught on right away. And when this happens you just keep on going. Though he was 100% right, it didn&#039;t matter. In fact I had a mod interested and others so it would buy me time to find something. One of the problems I had is I PM with Modziw trying to get information from him after my first post about cartels. That turned out to be my downfall. As he was on to me quickly and I needed to go a different route. So even after 4 pages, when you have nothing...it will die. And it did. So in 4 pages and just 4 hours this went away.<br /><br />Now at the same time I was doing all of this. I found out that my hookup for the Roxicodone I was getting, all the pills that would make me RICH! Went away ￼ I was so lost. And I was pissed. I had nothing to sell and no reason to buy a vendor account. And in fact no money to anyways. So I left this name and I went on to the others I had and I was just depressed and upset that I would not be making money. And while I was no longer WhistleBlower I was still on the threads and I was still on Silk Road reading and looking. And the name that kept popping up was RxKing.<br /><br />After all this was one of my targets. But when I sent Pm&#039;s to him about my first thread &quot;Cartels and price fixing&quot; he would not bite. He actually said I was crazy and told me there is no such thing and if there was he could care less. At the time this pissed me off. He was not supposed to say that! he was supposed to be concerned. He was supposed to care. He was neither.<br /><br />So while I was trolling around I would go to his vendor page and I would read his feedback&#039;s and it would make me cringe. I could not believe all the feedback&#039;s he was left that were saying how great he was and how happy they were and yuck yuck yuck. I was pissed. That could have been me. And then I would read his page and all his shit talking and all the things he said. I just hated it. What I hated most is he was where I wanted to be. Then he would be in the forums saying all kinds of things about how great he was and how great his business was. And that REALLY upset me. Yes I was jealous. I wanted to be king. And here was someone that was living my dream. And even worse it seemed like he was enjoying it. Like he was rubbing my nose in his success.<br /><br />So I made it a mission of mine to go after him in every way possible. To make random assumptions at his ethnicity. To jump on everything he posted and inject myself into the conversation with nonsense. Basically, I tried to engage him in every and any way possible. I wanted to get a rise out of him, to see him lose his cool, to see him go apeshit.. to see him break. But it wouldn&#039;t happen, he would stay how he is. We even went back and forth via PM a few times, and I tried to fuck with him as much as I could, but he would not bite. Well, he would respond.. but it would be just humor and bragging etc. Which would make me more mad.<br /><br />So then he held a contest during SR&#039;s down time.. which was really a giveaway. It was meant for only his customers.. and from what I now understand, of all the people posted, only 4 of them were actually HIS customers. Apparently he has accommodated all of them after the giveaway (later I find out). Anyways, so I took that opportunity and his silence on the forums regarding the giveaway and hammered him nonstop on the contest. Calling it a sham, a fake, a fraud. I had no evidence of this, but it was just my attempt to discredit him. I contacted some of the people who seemed to be friends with him, yet they did not respond. I then created a few fake accounts &quot;Oxy Rotten&quot;, and then &quot;JasonLeoGrande&quot;, and kept fanning the flames with my own shill accounts. Yes.. I&#039;m aware of how pathetic that sounds. Still, I couldn&#039;t get a rise out of RxKing. And the fact that people kept coming to his defense irritated me more. <br /><br />Fast forward to now. A severe personal tragedy has occurred in my life. I log back into SR after ages, and find a PM from RxKing from a few weeks ago, basically outlining the accounts of mine he thinks were me (most of them were), and that I was purposely trying to rile up the forums against him but it wasn&#039;t working. And simply asking me why?<br /><br />During the course of this personal tragedy I realized that I have not been an honest, or decent person most of my life. I&#039;ve been kind of &quot;rotten&quot;. And I&#039;ve gotten a kick out of fucking with people. And going through something as serious as I did, you get perspective in life.<br /><br />I extended my apology to RxKing and told him the situation in my life and how it has spiraled into a series of other problems in my life. I asked if he could help me out, and to my surprise he said he would, as long as I was honest. He said he would help me out in a heartheat (and that most probably nobody else in his shoes would have, nor would anyone in general) and that the only condition was that I come clean about what I&#039;ve been upto. Which makes me feel like a shittier person, because the one person I spent majority of my time here harassing and chasing.. turns out to be the first person who offered to help me when I&#039;m in a bind IRL. The irony.<br /><br />So thats me, thats my story, and the only thing I ever blew was &quot;HOT AIR&quot;, not a &quot;WHISTLE&quot;.<br /><br />Goodbye SilkRoad.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				No offense dude but you sound like you have mental problems.<br /><br />All you had to do was to sell stuff a bit cheaper than everyone else, but instead you created multiple identities, stalked vendors and their customers,&nbsp; made up lies, tried to convince people of cartels (which at the time seemed stupid as anyone was free to start up as a seller and sell at whatever price they wanted).<br /><br />This isn&#039;t just a bit crazy, this is crazy combined with effort and persistence AKA not right in the head.<br /><br />Seek help!<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Well the truth of the matter is.. I was going to come clean on all this shit regardless. I know I was behaving like a fuckin loose canon on the forums, and like I mentioned, a very serious personal tragedy put a lot of things in perspective. Online, IRL, just in general as the things I do in life and what the point is?<br /><br />Rxking did not &quot;push&quot; me to come forward. I was going to. But I had apologized to him for pretty much making him the target of all my frustration and I had mentioned in passing the shit that went down with me IRL and some problems I was facing. And his first reaction was to accept my apology, then he offered to take care of the bind I was in (I did not solicit that.. he flat out offered to take care of it. Which after talking to him I kind of understand from a human point of view why he would.. but a part of me is never going to understand that totally. It&#039;s bizarre.. someone who day and night just hurls abuse at you and false accusations and taunts.. they come to you and mention a personal problem and most people will tell them to go fuck themselves.. not offer to make the problem go away. So I really respect the guy for that.) Of course the condition was that I come clean clean about what was motivating me to cause all this unessary noise and single him out. Which I did privately and publicly. And then we discussed some private things about life and he berated me for a lot of my actions and pinpointed a lot of things.. at the end of the day he is well intentioned. And I do regret provoking him every chance I got.<br /><br />I&#039;m also apologetic to Modziw.. who I tried to bait. As well as others who I was corresponding privately and trying to entangle them in my games. I understand that a lot of people are here strictly for business.. so distracting them with made up conspiracy theories and creating shill accounts to legtimatize that was very lame. I&#039;m in my late 20s.. and now I have a lot of responsibility on my shoulders, I probably shouldn&#039;t have wasted months on a crusade based purely out of spite.<br /><br />That&#039;s really all I have to say about the matter. Apologies to the forum, to the mods, to the lurkers, Modziw, Rxking, and a lot of others whos time I wasted.<br /><br />Lesson folks : life is TOO fucking short for bullshit and games. Be honest, play straight, and you wont have regrets. <br /><br />And Rxking may be over the top, but a decent man he is.<br /><br />Thats all I have to say on the matter.

And if you notice there are a lot of post from me as every time this thread would fall off of the first page, I would post something.<br /><br />If you notice, one of my targets, Modziw, caught on right away. And when this happens you just keep on going. Though he was 100% right, it didn&#039;t matter. In fact I had a mod interested and others so it would buy me time to find something. One of the problems I had is I PM with Modziw trying to get information from him after my first post about cartels. That turned out to be my downfall. As he was on to me quickly and I needed to go a different route. So even after 4 pages, when you have nothing...it will die. And it did. So in 4 pages and just 4 hours this went away.<br /><br />Now at the same time I was doing all of this. I found out that my hookup for the Roxicodone I was getting, all the pills that would make me RICH! Went away ￼ I was so lost. And I was pissed. I had nothing to sell and no reason to buy a vendor account. And in fact no money to anyways. So I left this name and I went on to the others I had and I was just depressed and upset that I would not be making money. And while I was no longer WhistleBlower I was still on the threads and I was still on Silk Road reading and looking. And the name that kept popping up was RxKing.<br /><br />After all this was one of my targets. But when I sent Pm&#039;s to him about my first thread &quot;Cartels and price fixing&quot; he would not bite. He actually said I was crazy and told me there is no such thing and if there was he could care less. At the time this pissed me off. He was not supposed to say that! he was supposed to be concerned. He was supposed to care. He was neither.<br /><br />So while I was trolling around I would go to his vendor page and I would read his feedback&#039;s and it would make me cringe. I could not believe all the feedback&#039;s he was left that were saying how great he was and how happy they were and yuck yuck yuck. I was pissed. That could have been me. And then I would read his page and all his shit talking and all the things he said. I just hated it. What I hated most is he was where I wanted to be. Then he would be in the forums saying all kinds of things about how great he was and how great his business was. And that REALLY upset me. Yes I was jealous. I wanted to be king. And here was someone that was living my dream. And even worse it seemed like he was enjoying it. Like he was rubbing my nose in his success.<br /><br />So I made it a mission of mine to go after him in every way possible. To make random assumptions at his ethnicity. To jump on everything he posted and inject myself into the conversation with nonsense. Basically, I tried to engage him in every and any way possible. I wanted to get a rise out of him, to see him lose his cool, to see him go apeshit.. to see him break. But it wouldn&#039;t happen, he would stay how he is. We even went back and forth via PM a few times, and I tried to fuck with him as much as I could, but he would not bite. Well, he would respond.. but it would be just humor and bragging etc. Which would make me more mad.<br /><br />So then he held a contest during SR&#039;s down time.. which was really a giveaway. It was meant for only his customers.. and from what I now understand, of all the people posted, only 4 of them were actually HIS customers. Apparently he has accommodated all of them after the giveaway (later I find out). Anyways, so I took that opportunity and his silence on the forums regarding the giveaway and hammered him nonstop on the contest. Calling it a sham, a fake, a fraud. I had no evidence of this, but it was just my attempt to discredit him. I contacted some of the people who seemed to be friends with him, yet they did not respond. I then created a few fake accounts &quot;Oxy Rotten&quot;, and then &quot;JasonLeoGrande&quot;, and kept fanning the flames with my own shill accounts. Yes.. I&#039;m aware of how pathetic that sounds. Still, I couldn&#039;t get a rise out of RxKing. And the fact that people kept coming to his defense irritated me more. <br /><br />Fast forward to now. A severe personal tragedy has occurred in my life. I log back into SR after ages, and find a PM from RxKing from a few weeks ago, basically outlining the accounts of mine he thinks were me (most of them were), and that I was purposely trying to rile up the forums against him but it wasn&#039;t working. And simply asking me why?<br /><br />During the course of this personal tragedy I realized that I have not been an honest, or decent person most of my life. I&#039;ve been kind of &quot;rotten&quot;. And I&#039;ve gotten a kick out of fucking with people. And going through something as serious as I did, you get perspective in life.<br /><br />I extended my apology to RxKing and told him the situation in my life and how it has spiraled into a series of other problems in my life. I asked if he could help me out, and to my surprise he said he would, as long as I was honest. He said he would help me out in a heartheat (and that most probably nobody else in his shoes would have, nor would anyone in general) and that the only condition was that I come clean about what I&#039;ve been upto. Which makes me feel like a shittier person, because the one person I spent majority of my time here harassing and chasing.. turns out to be the first person who offered to help me when I&#039;m in a bind IRL. The irony.<br /><br />So thats me, thats my story, and the only thing I ever blew was &quot;HOT AIR&quot;, not a &quot;WHISTLE&quot;.<br /><br />Goodbye SilkRoad.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Jesus H Christ, how the phuc are we going to read all that? Gimme a moment or two.<br /><br />***comes back***<br /><br />First of all, thanks for taking up some of my time. No lie, it took me about and hour to read this. Old vendors are not really people you should target. Big mistake right there, you will find out why if you stay here long enough. <br /><br />That pricefixing thread killed me btw. Wasn&#039;t that taken in part from the Round Table? I wanted that thread forgotten TBO, no offense.<br /><br />I figured you were a shill pretty quickly though, some of your posts talking to yourself on the other one cracked me up no end. Great sense of humour. But I also realised you were talking fudge on the *Very* Serious Scandal thread. Lol Roky........................... ::) When someone says they will be blowing the whistle, it means they won&#039;t. <br /><br />So....... it was you then. Coming clean about the Rxing give-away thing in the Newbie section are we. I wondered who oxymoron and his chums were. Why all this crap that has taken up so much time? The amount of time spent doing all this could have been spent working to get money for a vendor&#039;s acc./ . Apparently that is a &quot;dream&quot; for some people around here. ??? <br /><br />Anyway. Fast forward to now. ::) A severe personal tragedy has occurred in your life. After all this crap I don&#039;t even know whether to believe it or if it is just another social experiment. And I really don&#039;t care anyway. But if it&#039;s true, then I have to say that that kind of response from RxKing -- after ALL THAT SHIT you did-- is not how a typical vendor would handle it, I can pretty much guarantee it.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br /><br />

King wasn&#039;t even competition!) is helping YOU out.. either he&#039;s an evil genius who&#039;s helping you for God knows what malicious reasons and has a bigger play, or he&#039;s got a good heart (better then most, helping someone who isn&#039;t even his customer). My money is on option B.. which.. in turn, should make you feel like even more of a schmuck. Everyone has problems in life dude... it does not give you a pass to interfere in people&#039;s business. Let&#039;s not forget, vendors here are running a business and to repeatedly make threads with their names and hurl accusations against their character could potentially hurt their bottom line.<br /><br />This is by far one of the most bizarre &quot;confessions&quot; I&#039;ve ever seen here. You recall we had an exchange on PM a while back where you claimed your only intent was to help the SR community. It seems like the intent was just to get attention.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know Modziw too well but from my brief interaction he&#039;s a well respected vendor and a good guy. I DO know RxKing well, and while I&#039;ve known him to be beyond helpful/generous to his friends &amp; customers.. but to help YOU of all people (instead of being ruthless as fuck)..really shows a difference in calibre of character. Does that make you feel like a POS?<br /><br />Good thing the Blower didn&#039;t actually start vending here.. probably would have been a disaster in every sense.<br /><br />Silk Road.. where every day gets weirder then the day before :o

				Hi everyone, MODZIW here,<br /><br />I received a PM from WhisteBlower today, apologizing, and I sent him a message back forgiving him and apologizing for anything I said that might have hurt his feelings..<br /><br />The two guys I hang out with these days are a Buddhist Monk and a Bible Thumping Evangelist (not the two together) and both of these guys have taught me the same two things:<br /><br />1.) Peace is a state of mind given by grace and sought out by the enlightened.<br /><br />2.) Anyone who talks as much as they do is a narcissist. If you don&#039;t know what that entails, look it up. They are fucking nuts.<br /><br />WhisteBlower is a narcissist, plain and simple. Even his loved one&#039;s passing is all about him.<br /><br />Having said that he is a member of this community and added some spice to the forums. In essence he tried to have some fun and got addicted, went through withdrawal when he ran out of fun, lashed out and then repented.<br /><br />Anyone here who has NOT done something similar, GTFO you don&#039;t belong on the road.<br /><br />Welcome to your family WhisteBlower. You are always welcome here. But try picking on the NSA or the French or something next time.<br /><br />Modzi

I meant to only come forward with an apology to the forum. After a lenghty back/forth with RxKing, and only after he gave the go-ahead, did I mention the part about him accepting my apology privately and even offering to bail me out of a jam. Otherwise, it was only really between him and me. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t add to the community discussion.. and most importantly LIED about things that could have harmed the reputation of vendors here. I<br />Vendors who are here to do business. Fucking around with another man&#039;s bread&amp;butter is just not acceptable, and I&#039;ve come to understand that.<br />And instead of &quot;breaking news&quot; that would help people, I just tried to rile people up every chance I got and drag them into non existent conspiracies/palace intrigues. It was all fucking useless and unecessary BS for people to have to deal with &amp;read.<br /><br />Anyways, thats my deal.

				I really hope he isn´t stupid enough to send you BTC or product. You´re just scamming him just like you tried to do before you´re just being dishonest because you &quot;lost&quot; before.You are just resorting to your last pathetic attempt. There was no personal tragedy, you´ve learnt nothing and you´re not sincere. what the fuck would you be on here asking for help for if something major happened in your life, you&#039;d be with family and friends. they would be the ones helping you. I really hope hes not dumb enough to give you anything or help you. <br /><br />
