				WTF did DPR not learn his lesson with limetless&#039; coke fueled constant ranting about shit now he went and got another equally annoying meth/coke fueled ranter about equally irrelevant shit.<br /><br />I know everyone can see this is going to end bad, everyday that passes more and more shit randomly disappears, more threads get locked for no fucking reason and you know this faggot is going to be twenty times worse in a few weeks.<br /><br />Someone needs to clean up all these rubbish mods fucking shit up.

				OP, I don&#039;t see what you see.<br /><br />If you have a problem with a mod then why not send DPR a message about it over on the SR? Posting comments like this with an anonymous account doesn&#039;t carry much weight. It makes you look sneaky.

				hahaha yeah right like im going to post on my regular account it has 0 -karma. you think I&#039;m going to risk getting negative karma when all I have is positive karma on my real account. I have enough bad things in life if my karma was to take a hit i don&#039;t think i could recope from that. I have been on this forum since jan. and only made 65 posts none of you know me so whats it matter all i do is review my products i order and read this forum. I see that dpr is making the same mistake twice and everyone of you here should be able to clearly fucking see this or do you all have ur blinders on, fucking sheep is what you all here. but it&#039;s ok i will lead each of you to the promised land and together we will be free from meth fueled tyranny like rants.

That&#039;s pretty gay to me fella. Also please don&#039;t insult these good people by calling you out for being a bitch because they are correct, it is a very cowardly way to go about things. You clearly don&#039;t know much about them because Wretched is no fan of mine so clearly he doesn&#039;t &quot;have his blinders on&quot; as you put it. <br /><br />And there will be no rants from me either, it&#039;s counterproductive to my new philosophy on life. :)

Along with correct spelling and balanced thought. :) <br /><br />I also think you misunderstand, people aren&#039;t taking you seriously BECAUSE you aren&#039;t using your own account. You may have a point, nobody has actually said that you haven&#039;t and I&#039;m sure some probably agree with you but the way you have presented it has lost you any credibility because it&#039;s quite a silly way to go around things given this is an anonymous forum. If you have something to say just express your view yourself, you shouldn&#039;t feel the need to hide behind a throw away persona when your real account is already a false persona anyway. :)<br /><br />So yeah, in short please improve on your spelling and grammar and don&#039;t use throwaway accounts because it just defeats the object of what you are trying to achieve, <br /><br />

				so you don&#039;t think the karma you acquire from another account you are using is, in fact, your karma? This is why you created another account? so you could get negative karma without it &quot;really&quot; being yours even though you as a person received said karma...are you on enough drugs that you believe that the karma that people award on this forum somehow translates into karma in your physical life? and if so, you do realize that since the physical you posted the comments likely to get that negative karma, then it will still follow you. <br /><br />and to you &quot;fixing&quot; my quote, you misunderstood the point of it. You see, if you have seen me online from time to time giving piles of shit to Limetless (we see a bit more eye to eye lately, likely due to his &quot;regular old member&quot; status) and I have disagreed with RxKing both in public and via PM, but the fact is that they are both worthy of the title of (wo)men (I don&#039;t really know their gender, but they post their version of the truth from their primary accounts no matter the &quot;karma&quot; bestowed upon them for their beliefs. Same goes for wretched. If I have something controversial to post, it 100% comes from this account ( I might post little tid bits of crazy bouncing thoughts from another newbie account) but if I intend to &quot;call someone out&quot; or blow a bunch of shite because I don&#039;t like/trust/get turned on by&nbsp; another member, you bet your ass it comes from the one I have chosen to be linked with me.<br /><br />hiding behind throw away nyms is a pussy move, and that translates to real karma (not the + and - of board karma)<br /><br />I know this is just fueling the discussion, but these punches don&#039;t need to be pulled. If you have beef with how a mod acts (find an important thread removed or feel mistreated in some fashion) take screenshots of how or what was wronged, and post them on a &quot;this is whats wrong with SRF&quot; board or something&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will even give out a FH account for something like this. You will find that most of the shite that gets deleted is deleted because it is fucking stupid, plain lies,or causing drama, not for some malicious attempt at silencing the &quot;truth&quot; about the system.<br /><br />That said, I honestly think that only posts revealing any personal information more than the nym / real first and last name of confirmed scammers should be deleted. If I ever get time to set up the supplement board I started months ago, that is the way it will be, but this is their board, so it&#039;s their rules....period (and just because you are on yours, doesn&#039;t change that)

This is why you created another account? so you could get negative karma without it &quot;really&quot; being yours even though you as a person received said karma...are you on enough drugs that you believe that the karma that people award on this forum somehow translates into karma in your physical life? and if so, you do realize that since the physical you posted the comments likely to get that negative karma, then it will still follow you. <br /><br />and to you &quot;fixing&quot; my quote, you misunderstood the point of it. You see, if you have seen me online from time to time giving piles of shit to Limetless (we see a bit more eye to eye lately, likely due to his &quot;regular old member&quot; status) and I have disagreed with RxKing both in public and via PM, but the fact is that they are both worthy of the title of (wo)men (I don&#039;t really know their gender, but they post their version of the truth from their primary accounts no matter the &quot;karma&quot; bestowed upon them for their beliefs. Same goes for wretched. If I have something controversial to post, it 100% comes from this account ( I might post little tid bits of crazy bouncing thoughts from another newbie account) but if I intend to &quot;call someone out&quot; or blow a bunch of shite because I don&#039;t like/trust/get turned on by&nbsp; another member, you bet your ass it comes from the one I have chosen to be linked with me.<br /><br />hiding behind throw away nyms is a pussy move, and that translates to real karma (not the + and - of board karma)<br /><br />I know this is just fueling the discussion, but these punches don&#039;t need to be pulled. If you have beef with how a mod acts (find an important thread removed or feel mistreated in some fashion) take screenshots of how or what was wronged, and post them on a &quot;this is whats wrong with SRF&quot; board or something&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will even give out a FH account for something like this. You will find that most of the shite that gets deleted is deleted because it is fucking stupid, plain lies,or causing drama, not for some malicious attempt at silencing the &quot;truth&quot; about the system.<br /><br />That said, I honestly think that only posts revealing any personal information more than the nym / real first and last name of confirmed scammers should be deleted. If I ever get time to set up the supplement board I started months ago, that is the way it will be, but this is their board, so it&#039;s their rules....period (and just because you are on yours, doesn&#039;t change that)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 Wretched. :)

It can be spiritual but it&#039;s also great fun.<br /><br />IMHO it&#039;s best to go camping with you bros when it is going to be a full moon night. Play some Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Beatles on a good speaker. Take some nice chilled beer with you. Make sure you have a good view of the setting sun. Drop some LSD around 3pm and just chill out with your bros. I&#039;ll send some positive vibes your way when I pop my next blotter&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I agree with you about drawing deeper spiritual meaning from a drug though. I think it is important to remember that the entire experience is just because the neurotransmitter levels get so wonky. So it&#039;s best to take the experience with a pinch of salt. That being said it can change your life in a good way.<br /><br />Steve Jobs once said &quot;Maybe if Bill Gates had dropped acid he&#039;d have been a broader guy&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So true!

				For sure its not easy to be a mod, i don&#039;t really like limitess but \i had no issues with the way he was doing his job....<br /><br />RxKing on the other hand is a big mistake of DPR&#039;s along with allowing mrouid back after he admitted to trying to scam dpr.. anyways...<br /><br /><br />rxKing is a joke in my eyes... first he woke up one morning and commented on a thread I was in... then he deleted my comments and still talked trash!!!<br /><br />then another member told him that this could be considered censorship and he just laughed it off!! FUCK THAT and FUCK HIM!!!<br /><br /><br />not only that... this thread was a mrouid contact info thread and he was banned the night before..... so not only did RxKing bump mrouids contact info 4 times after he was banned he also deleted my comments to shut me up... he only deleted the thread once i pointed out that it was his JOB TO DELETE the thread and not his job to argue with me and delete my words!! <br /><br />I agree with the Op that if things keep going the way,&nbsp; it can only mean bad news for SR!&nbsp; :(<br /><br />first the site keeps going down, then mods delete our words because they dont agree (nothing I said was against the rules, I did not spam, I just voiced my opinion and asked a question to another vendor)<br /><br />and now DPR sends out the message that even if you try to cheat SR, and its in black and white and we can confirm that it is correct, we will still let you sell as long as you &quot;promise to never do it again&quot; It shows me that some priorities are not straight in the back end of SR!<br /><br />&nbsp;:(<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Rumor has it even Kennedy was taking amphetamines. Also a little birdy tells me that it was because Miss&nbsp; Norma Jean got JFK into LSD that he didn&#039;t want to nuke the USSR during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Pure speculation of course&nbsp; ;) But drugs have serious potential to make the world a better place.<br /><br />Kids these days use way too many nootropics. IMO nothing beats handwork and diligence but to each their own. Also the long term safety of Adderall and Ritalin is something that still needs to be determined. Nootropics are tempting but the movie Limitless does a pretty good job of highlighting the danger with nootropics.<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely not cool enough for blow&nbsp; :( I guess I was cool when LSD was cool and that was a longtime ago. I still fell pretty cool though&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

Haven&#039;t you ever drawn real life meaning from works of fiction? That&#039;s the best part about works of fiction! Also fiction is inspired by real life so I think one can use the movie as a reminder not to mess with unproven drugs just because they offer a cognitive advantage and that is the point I was trying to make. I would never have mentioned it if your username and avatar did not allude to the movie.<br />I mean that it highlights because it is based on fact. There are many cases of college students winding up with cardiac arrhythmias because of the use of amphetamines and methylphenidate. Also I often read about people complaining of a decreased ability to focus after years of using methylphenidate. And for most people who don&#039;t read about the potential hazards of using nootropics but do watch movies, I think it&#039;s a great thing that movies like Limitless highlight the potential hazards.<br /><br />Also I don&#039;t look upon being a good person and not being offensive is a part of a deal. I look at is as a duty. I won&#039;t hold it against you if you threw racial, religious or homophobic slurs my way. But you should not want to do those things because of who your are as a person.<br />Live and let live brother. Sorry my opinion about a movie upset you so much. Take care. Bye.

The only &quot;warning&quot; I got out of the movie was &quot;Don&#039;t sit on your ass when you&#039;re suffering negative effects, use your super-pill to learn pharmacology and fix it yourself.&quot;

				I&#039;ll bite :)<br /><br />So&nbsp; to the OP. Sorry one of your post got deleted. Just know it was because it was really shitty and nothing personal to you. <br /><br />To MTL. Reread your post. All you talk about is Mr.Ouid in it and that I deleted that post after I commented in it and after you pointed something out. First know that I commented in that thread that you as A vendor can not attack other members or vendors. Then the next day when I woke up I had a note that Mr.Ouid is not a vendor so I deleted the post. As it had his contact info in it as a vendor. You didn&#039;t point anything out. I have warned you as&nbsp; has DPR that you need to clean up your act. No one said anything about me censoring you. In&nbsp; fact everyone has said how you need to go.<br /><br />Mr.Ouid is now back as a vendor and you need to respect DPR and his decision. <br /><br />And for anyone who reads this that has a complaint about a post being deleted or moved you can always message me and I will explain why. In the past this has not happened a lot and a lot of double or more threads of the exact same thing were posted. And all of us have to sift through more then a few post saying the exact same thing. Or what happens is much like the OP. They are scarred to use there real name so they create some fake one and make some stupid post. These are the type of things I am deleting. The post&#039;s I move is because you make a post in the wrong forum. I do not delete post where you(meaning everyone in here) are making post&#039;s viewing your thoughts or opinion. As those post need to stay. I DO NOT DELETE POST WHERE PEOPLE LEAVE OPINIONS!<br /><br />I have chosen not to make a post about where I move a post to. As these too clog up the forum. You can always find a post in here as this community is pretty small. Again if you cant...then message me.<br /><br />My only goal is to clean up this place, and to help answer new and old members questions about SR. I am not here to police other vendors or be a ball buster. But I have to clean this place up. And in doing so you are going to make people upset, I don&#039;t really care about that. I care to have these forums a place where you can voice your opinion and not have to listen to some junk from a brand new account or from another vendor attacking you because no one likes them or their product.<br /><br />So if anyone thinks different. I am sorry. <br />&nbsp;<br />I do like how this post moved from what the OP had intended to where it was going and that&#039;s why I did not post in it! or delete it ;) until now. This is a good example of a thread that is titled one way but then takes a turn to another and why a lot of post can not be deleted since the community enjoys them. But when a topic go&#039;s off course then it is our job to lock it. <br /><br />

Your attitude has been horrible, you&#039;ve sketched me the fuck out, and I just don&#039;t like what I&#039;ve seen from you. In everything I&#039;ve read, mrouid was being set up by another vendor who was out to get him shut down. And you&#039;re selling the same strain he has.
