				I will be flying domestically in the US soon. I have some infamous white speaker pills I want to take with me (approx 6). Does anyone have any fool proof ways to beat the TSA? I&#039;ve hid them &quot;on myself&quot; several times before, weed too, however they didn&#039;t do the random full body scans then. Any ideas? Thanks.

Throw it in your bag. Might want to try vitamin b6.<br />Also, if you know where you are going might try just mailing it there? Low risk of domestic mailing and I would at least feel better doing that.

				Great idea.....HOWEVER in the days of the FULL BODY SCAN that would not work.&nbsp; Not everyone is scanned and you can opt out but you better believe they will give you a thorough pat down.&nbsp; THat would be the test but I wouldn&#039;t feel safe.&nbsp; Best would be to keep it in your checked baggage in some vitamins or something like that....maybe one or 2 in a sock here and there?

				Don&#039;t fear the full-body scan.&nbsp; Last time I flew they tried to send me through one of those full-body scans.&nbsp; I said fuck that, and got the pat-down instead.&nbsp; It&#039;s not nearly as thorough as some of the horror-stories would have you believe.&nbsp; I suppose YMMV depending on the TSA agent you get, though,&nbsp; but still, it&#039;s just 6 pills.&nbsp; Put them in a vitamin bottle and be done with it.&nbsp; Even if they select your bag for further inspection, they&#039;re not going to dump out your vitamins and play the &quot;which one of these is not like the other&quot; game.<br /><br />Or, if you don&#039;t want to do that, and you can wrap them in something airtight, stick &#039;em between your butt cheeks.&nbsp; A pat-down isn&#039;t going to have you bend over and spread &#039;em.

				Biggest thing is don&#039;t tell on yourself.&nbsp; Be as chill as you can, relax have some coffee and smoke a cigarette, walk through just like you always do and don&#039;t give it a thought until you&#039;re home.&nbsp; Rapid eye movement, quick head turns, fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, giving too many details, acting eager to be done with the search...&nbsp; Lots of nervous things will tell them to check you inside and out.&nbsp; Distract yourself ahead of time and forget about it, your pills should be the last thing on your mind, forget them entirely.
