				This strain of marijuana has a distinct peanutbutter smell, uncanny really, is really fluffy and light, green with red hairs, and produces a very mellow, body high and makes you want to go to sleep while it&#039;s wearing off as well as giving a case of the munchies. Anyone have any idea of what strain this is?

				Quick Google of peanut butter strain came up with Peanut Butter Goo and Peanut Butter Kush? Never heard of it and have a hard time imagining nugs that smell like peanut butter. Had some that smelled like diesel, but that was because it was smuggled cross country in the diesel tank of a truck, and wasn&#039;t packaged well enough. Unfortunately it tasted like diesel too, and not the sour kind.<br /><br />Other than that, nugs I&#039;ve smelled have all been either the earthy/mid smell, a piney smell (usually sativa), a fruit loops smell (usually dense indica), lemon and slight variances of these. Peanut butter would blow my mind.

				I was thinking an indica as well judging by effects.. I did a quick look on seedfinder.eu afterwards and found two strains that have a peanut smell one is called The Church by greenhouse seed co. And another called amnesia lemon by Barneys Farm.<br />

				I&#039;ve had Church before, and it had no peanut butter smell whatsoever. It smelled like a pine tree.<br /><br />Did you get it from a vendor or what? I&#039;d mix it with some Banana Kush, cus peanut butter and bananas belong together.

				Maybe it takes a little imagination to say it&#039;s peanut-butter. Bayes Theorem says that it&#039;s more likely to be a common strain than an uncommon strain simply because there&#039;s a lot more of that going around.

				but don&#039;t pictures contain meta data or whatever it&#039;s called? Not that I have an HD camera to begin with, but how do I know a picture can&#039;t be traced back to my cell phone?
