				Ok, so last night I was browsing the SR forums at about 4 a.m. when I hear a knock on my door. I&#039;m like wtf who&#039;s knocking at this time. So I go ahead and open the door and freeze. LE. They ask me &quot;Are you the owner of the automobile xxxxxx?&quot;. At that point I started shaking, I knew I forgot to take my weed and still had 4g in the glovebox. I tell him yeah, it&#039;s my car and he says &quot;someone has broken into your car, can you come with us to identify whats missing&quot;. I say ok, go with them, I get to my car, I see the window on the driver&#039;s side was broken, I look inside, I noticed an older phone and charger I left there was missing, some 50 euros, the weed and rolling papers. The glovebox was left open. <br />At this point I calm down, because the drugs are gone, I tell them about the phone and the money and as I&#039;m almost about to go back inside, another cop radios in they&#039;ve got him. At that point I almost pissed my pants. They bring the guy there, they ask him if he broke into the car, obviously say no, so they throw him in the back of the police van and start beating the crap out of him. 10 mins later one of the cop emerges with my phone and money. He&#039;s then tells me, they&#039;ve found him smoking a joint and in possession of enough drugs to be considered a dealer (piece of shit was getting high off my stuff) and that I shouldn&#039;t worry because they&#039;re gonna surely get a conviction. I acted all chill and was like &quot;yeah, these fucking junkies breaking into people&#039;s cars to buy drugs&quot;. <br />So yeah, first thing after I recovered my phone and money, I took my stash to a secure location, but I&#039;m still scared I could get in trouble if the guy tells them he found the weed in my car. Do you think they&#039;ll believe him? I mean the guy was homeless, it&#039;s rare for homeless guys here in Romania to smoke weed (they sniff some kind of glue or paint) and everything over 3g is considered dealing. Another problem is he also stole my rolling papers which were &quot;RAW unbleached&quot; which I bought last year in the US and which are very rare in Romania, so they&#039;re going to naturally know he&#039;s stolen the stash and the papers but can they prove it was my car?<br />Also if he confesses he has the weed from my car is that enough for cops to follow me around and get search warrants and shit? Would they even bother to move their ass for such a small amount? I&#039;m just really paranoid right now.

				First of all, I would sure think they won&#039;t care about you, they got their perp, end of story.<br />Second, I would delete this thread. However unlikely, LE could find tie it back to you and if that happens it&#039;s a clear admission of guilt.

				They will not believe a bum who just confessed to breaking into your car and stealing your phone. They will believe you. You&#039;re the victim here.
