				in...<br /><br />I&#039;m looking at buying a product. There are two vendors that in my mind are equally as safe and trustworthy. They are the basically the same price. (By basically I mean one is $3 higher and it&#039;s a bulk order so not a big deal). <br /><br />Now, the conundrum, I&#039;d honestly like to try both of them out. This isn&#039;t because I think the product will be much different, just because I genuinely appreciate what they are doing and the product they are selling and I&#039;d like to support them both. The problem being that I don&#039;t need the amount of two of these orders and they don&#039;t have orders up for half of the amount where I could buy from both. I&#039;ve been sitting here trying to decide which one to give my money and can&#039;t decide. <br /><br />Do I message both explaining and seeing if they are willing to deal on the price or do I just pick? SR prides itself on being a free market. The free market dictates that I look out for #1 and try to get them into a bidding war. My conscience seems to say that pushing these guys down on an already fair price is a bit of an asshole move. <br /><br />Vendors, what are your thoughts on this? Are you willing and happy to out bid someone for someone&#039;s business or do you look down on those that do it? I&#039;m not asking for anything free or saying &quot;hey I don&#039;t have the money&quot; I&#039;m literally trying to distinguish which vendor to go with because they have the same deal. It&#039;s like if Target and Walmart set up booths at the county fair and had the same product at the same price next to each other. An extra trip to a different store is no factor here. <br /><br />TL;DR Is this a free market where no matter how good a deal you&#039;re getting you try to get a better deal or do you pick a vendor who has the same deal as another and pay that price? TL;DR doesn&#039;t cut it read the thread lazy ass! :p

				If one seems as good as the other, I&#039;d just pick one. If they&#039;re proven vendors you&#039;ll be happy either way. Because vending can be so time consuming vendors often don&#039;t have time to get into bidding wars and it&#039;s usually not the chillest thing to do anyway. Most calculate their acceptable margin for the risk taken and list their products at the lowest possible price that remains &quot;worth&quot; the risk they&#039;ve taken on for themselves.<br /><br />Anyway, there&#039;s always next time for the other vendor if you so choose.<br /><br />Rocker

				Thanks rocker. Like I said, both vendors were fair. No one posted in here maybe because of the title idk. A lot of people here are really into the free market so I thought there would be more discourse. Anyway, like I said, I already felt like both vendors were being fair and just decided to go with the vet.
