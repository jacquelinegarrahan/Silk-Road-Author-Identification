				Hashs have a very clear sativa THC high, smoking buds will give you the rock lock stone that comes with the CBD. <br /><br />Hash, extracts, oils, there all good for a change IMO, cause nothing will get you stupefied like a fat spliff of some top shelf indoor.

				i prefer flowers over hash. i like the flavor, taste, bouget of flowers. It does however take a strain with hi thc to give me the buzz you might think of, BUT, i smoke these days for medical reasons and just because i don&#039;t get high on some weed the cbd takes care of med issues. I smoked hash exclusively for 3 years while living in europe. We started out smoking hash purchased from africans on the street that called it :bubble gum&quot; imo the quality was what you see on SR from oversea hash vendors, low quality. We eventually climbed the chain over there anded ended up with black hash, sheets about 5/8th inch thick hard as a rock, but with a shiny oily surface, 2 or 3 deep lungfuls and you were high for hours, the best came from a region of the world known as cradle of civilization, we had the dankity for the last 12 months. The only time i had weed was when i went to holland. That time period was so crazy for me, there was shit that went down that was like it was in the movies.&nbsp; BUT american hash is a whole different subject, the best hash and concentrates in the wortld come from the states. For strictly head ringing, fresh head buzz, i prefer dabs, i fear for you youngins that start with the concentrates at an early age will cause you to not get as high from bud. Sorry to ramble on, but i don&#039;t see a clear answer to the op original question

				I prefer hash. To me it feels like a cleaner high.&nbsp; Better taste, smooth, easy to inhale...<br />I like to smoke it alone. In a pipe. Light it a bit--toke it--light it--toke it-- etc.. good hash will last a long time... lot longer than weed!<br />

				not sure about the opium. pakistani and probably afghan hashes are often grown in morocco now, they&#039;ve transported the indica plants there. they can&#039;t grow fuck all except weed on that terrain, soil and climate. i don&#039;t mind hash for a chill daytime smoke in the sun but a good indoor weed hybrid is a winner for me. hot rocks are evil! and i never smoked hash without tobacco so i wouldn&#039;t know what to do with it now. i don&#039;t like using bongs or pipes.

				I would say weed as hash gets old quickly with consistent use as do edibles. Nice for a change up.

				I definitely prefer buds over extracts or edibles. The taste of a good flower can&#039;t be carried into a hash to the same degree. Plus, whilst the nice heady buzz given from hash is nice, I never feel that it fully satisfies my craving for a nice stoney time. Supercharged joints / bowls are the way to go....best of both worlds ;)<br />- JH

				Normally weed, but hash has a special place in my heart for sure. Last night I had some and spent a few hours glued to the couch but feeling incredible, really hazy and trippy and I was continually surprised at how strong it was, and how different the high felt from smoking bud.
