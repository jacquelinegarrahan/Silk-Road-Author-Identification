				you need to secure all data you have ever entered in your browser as it likely dumps all of it (passwords, credit cards etc..), after you have secured your computer. and consider future communications compromised.<br />likely it copies itself in many ways and you will never be safe, unfortunately the only solution is to re-install Windows.<br />anti-virus &amp; firewalls are not good enough, any &#039;decent&#039; virus will bypass it so dont rely on it. <br /><br />take this as a valuable lesson for next time<br /><br />

Therefore you need to urgently take steps on external device to secure these data, your computer is compromised.&nbsp; A virus-removal now is not safe.<br />It&#039;s a horrible job re-installing windows and all programs etc...&nbsp; but trust me- it&#039;s for the best, and the only way to be sure.<br />All passwords entered in your browser - start fixing it now, but not with your current computer/windows as it&#039;s prolly compromised.<br />prolly SR accounts were the target, so don&#039;t log in there any time soon or ur wallets gna be ripped, surely.<br />Only the &#039;bad&#039;/old virus are picked up by anti-virus, more important is caution.<br /><br />It&#039;s a horrible job but it needs to be done- format &amp; re-install your computer right away, and secure your data.&nbsp; will give ya some time to think this thru aswell, hopefully smarter for the future:)<br /><br />best of luck

				What passwords are you going to have used in this current session of tor?<br /><br />Probably this forum and nothing else, I would clean your comp anyway but unless you use the same password for everything you should be ok. I suspect this guy is trying to get SR passwords from people stupid enough to have the same password on here as they do there.

				I almost went to this address, I saved it to use later but dont think I actually used it at all. The thing is yesterday or something I went away and when I came back my screen was all white just like someone said in this thread. It went back to normal when I pressed escape. <br /><br />Does anyone who knows about this think Ive been infected with something, coz I cant be sure I clicked something in the last few days coz Ive been messing about. You say they use it to gather passwords you&#039;ve typed into the browser does this include the TOR browser with things like my SR passwords?<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up every one.

				Jimmy.<br /><br />Im not sure coz not computer geek guy but I got that malware thing and for some reason when I open up tor it sends me a message saying they blocked access to a potentially dangerous site or something. It always comes up and I just assumed it was because of the nature of TOR they cant protect you on TOR like they can with something like google sites but you know on TOR you cant expect or use normal things as they either dont work or compromise tor anonymity. <br /><br />Not sure if anything I say means anything but Im a good guesser.

				Well if it helps, i clicked on the &quot;link we do not speak of&quot; and received the white screen as well but after just completing 2 runs each by superantispyware and malwarebytes i&#039;m completelty clean! Plus like everyone else said, if you used torin it&#039;s default settings you should be good!
