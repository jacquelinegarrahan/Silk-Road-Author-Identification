				I&#039;m sorry but just because you are adding a possibly slightly different cheese and maybe a % less or more ketchup than usual you can&#039;t brand something as a &quot;California Melt&quot; it&#039;s just bullshit because it&#039;s basically the same as all the other burgers you sell and then brand as individual. You&#039;re just a shameful example of unoriginality that has become pervasive in modern Western society. Why don&#039;t you try and invent a truly original burger recipe that would require your slave drones to actually think more than the usual &quot;Burger bun bottom, spit, beef patty, phlegm, cheese, sauce, fart&quot;? Because that would require some creative integrity. Fuck you.

				I think the new burger looks good at least it has mayo on it something that McDonalds in the UK can,t seem to cope with sachets of mayo cause apparently it goes off! I,ve had sachets of mayo from Mcdonals in the canary Islands and its fuckin hot there but they seem to cope, i think working in McDonalds requires an IQ of under 80&nbsp; ;D

				Surely anyone should be able to sue McDonalds and the like for false advertising because the pictures of their food on the menu dont match up at all to the soggy cardboard like shlop that gets served over the counter!<br />Oh,and btw No I Dont want fkn fries with that or a fkn drink because if I did I would have ordered it when I ordered my burger you spotty pre-pubesant liberal student fuck!!

				I have vowed that I will never eat Mcdonnalds again for as long as I live, it once made me really ill, food poisoning I guess.<br />The shit they pump into their &#039;burgers&#039; and &#039;chicken&#039; is unbelievable, do some research on it. There advertising campaign is more unbelievable, how can they really expect to brainwash people into thinking that they sell GOOD food?! Whats even fucking worse, 90% of the dumbass British public actually believe their bullshit! WAKE UP PEOPLE! Really fucking toddles my pip. It also breaks my heart to see young children tucking into their &#039;happy&#039; meals pumped full of carcinogens and shit, for when I/if I am a parent, I will not let my children eat their SHIT.<br />FUCK McDonnalds. <br />I&#039;m sorry for those of you who actually like McDonalds as we&#039;re all allowed an opinion obviously, but my feelings of hatred towards this place are strong.

				What about the ads that show people eating McDonalds after a work out? Or the face that, that shit aint&#039; food. If you stop eating fast food and drinking soda for 2 weeks. I bet if you tried to eat it you would throw up. <br /><br />If I could give someone any advice its. Eat and drink good in LIFE. I grow up poor and still would not eat McDonalds, just prefer to cook at home. Then went in the army and would eat a MRE before McDonalds. <br /><br />Try new food guys, you don&#039;t have to be a foodie to eat great.<br /><br />SR COOK BOOK &lt;----------&nbsp; We should do it <br /><br />

				Damn I thought this was just gunna die lol. Doesn&#039;t bother me per se about the health issues, it&#039;s just their bullshit lack of creativity on their burgers that vexes me. You wana sell me a California burger, go ahead but mother fucker, you better make sure it doesn&#039;t remind me of an Australian burger or I will stab you from over the counter.

				If I ever get on that McDonald&#039;s kick, it&#039;s once or twice a year and I satisfy it with a Junior Chicken. Americans don&#039;t know what a Junior Chicken is because their McChicken is so damn cheap. Whenever I&#039;m driving through the states, my friends and I make a point to stop at a McD&#039;s and stuff our faces with McNuggets, because they&#039;re half the price compared to Canada. Sometimes you can even get 50 nuggets for 10 dollars, what the goddamn hell. Are they grinding up Chernobyl chickens? Probably. Still worth it once a year.
