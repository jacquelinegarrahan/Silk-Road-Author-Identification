				well hes willing to do face2face or use the escrow system with localbitcoins(buyer pays small escrow fee for his peace of mind) also easiest way is the way he leaned from Blue Sky! that like the Localbitcoins way you get your coins before geting to the parking lot! deposits at Bank of America sir!

				you tell him the amount you want, try not to pick to popular of a number btw! when you two decide on a fair trade for USD you make the deposit and the coins get sent to address of your choice either SR account(dont tell him that) or the wallet on the phone in your hand at the bank! you decide and if your nervous and want to use escrow go through lbtc and you deposit when the escrow is funded!

				Do you have a vendor account?&nbsp; If you want to sell anything here - including btc - you need to have a vendor account and conduct sales on the main site.

				So you have two people running your profile? You are willing to meet face to face? You&#039;re letting customers &quot;decide&quot; on a fair price? The fuck is going on here?

				well within reason, the fee is8%-16% above index depends on size of sale method of payment and such. no my friend who mines and deals in coins wants me to advertise for him, and yes he will meet face2face sir!&nbsp; but really he wants to see if it makes sense to set up a vendor account also needs to know is there is a US market for Ganja Man weed and hash/pollen?
