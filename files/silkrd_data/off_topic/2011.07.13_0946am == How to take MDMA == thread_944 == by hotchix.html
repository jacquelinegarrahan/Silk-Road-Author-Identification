				I&#039;m thinking of buying some MDMA.&nbsp; I notice most of the sales are for the powder.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only taken pills (and 1 MDA gel capsule) in the past.<br /><br />Do sellers ship the powder as powder, or in gel capsules?<br />How do I put the powder into a gel capsule?<br />How much MDMA powder should I take at once (how much would be in a pill?)?<br /><br />Thanks

				you might want to just try sniffing it untill you get where you want to be...or you can fill one of those capsule halves a little over the domed bottom of the longer half. For starters :D

				I always do it orally and never snort and find that an 8th (125mg) of a gram is a decent dose for starters and about the same as a strongish pill. I will often &quot;top-up&quot; during the night, but nowadays try never to go over 1/4 gram in one night ( I once did a full gram in a night and it was far too much for me and stopped me from peeing for 2 days!). Personally, I just eat it washed down with a drink, but I have put it in capsules in the past or dissolved in drinks. Takes a little longer to work in a capsule, though, and I feel it isn&#039;t usually really worth the effort. If you want to have a few handy &#039;doses&#039; (useful at a festival, for instance) and be sure of not accidentally having too much, then gelcaps can be a good idea. It will be just as strong no matter how you do it. To fill the capsules, use a tiny funnel if you can find one or a sharply creased square of paper. If filling caps, I generally get a sponge scourer and make a cut in it to hold the cap. This gives you two free hands for the fiddly business of filling it.

				if you are at home/ small party etc - it&#039;s perfect just to throw the stuff into a glass of water (i use 1/3 water or even less:) and drink it. Capsules.. I have tried bk-mdma in capsules.. either you have to take a bit more than snorting, or.. well, will test this more. How to put it in capsules? For me, the easiest way is to take a straw*, cut some of the front away (just do a small scoop of a front of the straw) - and vuola - you have yourself a drug dispensing apparatus;)<br /><br />The dosage depends on your weight. Basically it&#039;s 2mg/kg. That is if your weight is 75kg 150mg of (good quality) mdma is enough to love the whole universe:). I&#039;m about 72/73kg - last time i took about 160mg - was awesome.. My friend is maybe ~80kg +/-2kg, he took 140mg, he said was awesome too.. But if it&#039;s your first time, you don&#039;t know how the drug will work, how will you tolerate it - try ~80mg first (on a test-evening;). <br />The good practice is to take another ~80mg about 30/60min after your first dose (if it&#039;s not your beta-test evening:) - this will prolong the peak for about an hour or more.. Everything you will take afterward won&#039;t get you to the same heights, however it can make your teeth grinding more intense (well that&#039;s what the literature sez, I haven&#039;t gone anywhere over 2 boosts per evening ever).<br />Enjoy the mdma magic. I recommend good music, and a friend (spouse), or two (friends;). Mdma at parties is imho waste of good product. I you want the &#039;awake&#039; feeling an some extra energy - cheaper and better for this is bk-mdma (methylone/m1) , but maybe that&#039;s just me.<br />----<br />*by&nbsp; straw i mean this small with flexible head one, not the mcDonalds-like horse-straw =)

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend snorting it, your nose will block up and your eyes and nose will be streaming un-uncontrollably. You will definitely feel the effects, but just look as though your upset.<br /><br />Bombing is good, it just takes a while (wrapping a dose in a smoking paper or the like). The best part to bombing is that you get that really warm, fuzzy, tingling sensation in your belly just before you come up.<br /><br />I usually dump a gram in a water bottle and share the bottle between 1-2 friends. MDMA tastes a lot better than Ecstasy pills. - You will get to that place you want to be VERY quickly.

				Best way is to dip it.&nbsp; Just dip your finger in the bag to get some powder on it, then rub it on your gums.&nbsp; You&#039;ll feel it instantly.&nbsp; If you snort it, a lot of it will get wasted and then it will also go down your throat which is really nasty.

				I recommend bombing it. ( rolling into a rizzla sheet(s)) Cant taste anything. :) IÂ´ve heard snorting hurts like hell , but thats the fastest way. Even when taken orally , for me it takes only about 30-40 mins to start working , so no biggie.

				There is an authoritative way to find out.<br /><br />Just google &quot;drug name+bioavailability&quot;&nbsp; the results will show % absorption by every route.&nbsp; even rectal!~<br /><br />So far, Google has taught me more about getting more bang for my drug dollar than any other source.&nbsp; Except maybe erowid.

				Those who have tried going the rectal route, how did you do it, and how was the result from plugging different than the usual congestion method?

				Thanks everyone for the advice.&nbsp; I like the idea of just mixing it with water, seems like the easiest way.
