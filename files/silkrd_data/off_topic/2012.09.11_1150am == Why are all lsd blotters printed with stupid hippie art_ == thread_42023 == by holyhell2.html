				I mean, considering how important a thing it is not to get caught, why do all blotters have this ridiculously obvious art on them?<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be so much better to make them look like receipts, or photos, or just little fucking white bits of paper?<br /><br />I wonder how many people have been arrested or worse in the history of the world by a pig or other leo who saw one of these things and would have never given it a second glance except it had this crap on it? Whoa man, this trippy art will get you in the mood for your psychonautical journey of becoming one with the cosmos, right?<br /><br />I&#039;m planning to pick some up but it makes me nervous to picture a customs agent spotting it inside the birthday card or whatever they&#039;ll send it in.<br /><br />Okay, rant finished, now someone please tear me apart and explain that there is in fact a really good reason that I&#039;m just too dumb to have figured out myself.

				They dont always come on hippy art, they do more often than not though.<br />There used to be ones on plain white perforated blotters going around irl.<br />I think that they&#039;re used as id means. Ie someone will notice a hoffman blotter as something linked to a certain dose/strength

				Goddamn you&#039;re bitter. <br /><br />Why do Ecstasy pills have stamps of the playboy bunny and triforces on them? Why not just make the pills look like Ibuprofen?<br /><br />Because, <br /><br />1. Everyone will be afraid they are being ripped off and that their pills are actually Tylenol, and in most cases this would probably be true because it would just be so damn easy.<br /><br />2. Because that&#039;s boring and unappealing, and thus won&#039;t sell nearly as much.<br /><br />

				probably as a means to specify who&#039;s dose is who&#039;s (talking about waaay up at the top of the food chain here)<br /><br />but you&#039;re right i guess.<br /><br />for us lowly consumers, it can be seen as more dangerous since WoW is super stealth but whatever. if you get busted for having something as small as paper, you should reevaluate your IRL security skillz

				WoW, in case you weren&#039;t aware is White on White. Blank white blotter paper which you thought up.&nbsp; Do some research before posting a rant like this.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it were a simple honest inquiry it wouldn&#039;t annoy the rest of us nearly as much as a POINTLESS rant because some dumb schmuck didn&#039;t read or use the search function and decided instead to clog up the forums.

				Because the guys with access to crystal want to lay that kind of blotter.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like that all you have to do is source your own crystal.. and lay it yourself...<br /><br /><br /><br />trolololololololololol.......

				OP has a point. <br /><br />I like your receipt idea because it is both unique and common. Really any type of print, which at first glance would not be noticeable, would work.&nbsp; For example if you had to smuggle 500 sheets, why would you not print it on a book?
