				100mgs of M1, and 100mgs of drone has gone up for snhozzer. Been 5 min and I&#039;m feeling nearly overwhelming euphoria already, not even peaked yet. Sollem, would indeed say this is pre ban drone. Will do&nbsp; a full report later when I sober up, for now though, music is my priority! :D

Man, I&#039;ve just combined it with M1! Now that is overwhelming, but Drone alone is overwhelming as well, but yeah man I would say do this combo when you can!&nbsp; This is pre ban ain&#039;t it? Bringing back some memories for sure. I&#039;m glad someone else is on it too!&nbsp; ;) Well minus the M1, but don&#039;t worry, you can do this combo another time! Stay on the forums pal, I don&#039;t want to be the only one posting shit&nbsp; ;D. <br /><br />@ Duke, sorry mate! Least me and gtgeorgz are giving you an idea how good drone is! :P Think I alone have encouraged people on here to use Mephedrone.

				what have you got - #3 or #4?<br /><br />#4, if it is the bollocks, just a match head mate. in fact as it&#039;s your first time it doesn&#039;t matter what it is -a match head will do you. zero tolerance gives you a proper nod on your first go. the quarter gram i got&nbsp; i probably did every other weekend and it lasted a couple of months. that was the BEST SR has ever had to offer though according to the H thread

				Fucking amazing man! As you know this morn I railed 100mgs of drone and 100mgs of M1. An hour after that (I went off the forums) I railed 150mgs of drone and parachuted 100mg of M1. Didn&#039;t last that long, id say I was peaking for two and a half hours I dunno, couldn&#039;t be arsed keeping track of time. But as I left the peak I snorted 15mgs of H, feeling relaxed now! And I still have the music appreciation from the drone/m1 and the stim type euphoria.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t advise this obviously. But I couldn&#039;t wait any longer to crack open the H haha

				oooh interesting stuff! what does the H actually feel like then? i would never do it just because i know people that have had their lives ruined by it, but that was IV not snorting it. but be safe man! :) i swear #4 was for sorting not #3?&nbsp; :-\

				People on here told me you can snort no 3 but its just not as strong. I didn&#039;t want it to be strong anyway, no tolerance to it. And well, slightly more relaxed, but thats about it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not getting any of these &#039;warm wrapped up in a blanket feelings&#039; people describe, but maybe thats because its weak H and I have stims in my system.<br /><br />

				Yeah careful with that H mate, it&#039;s defo the uppers keeping you from nodding&nbsp; - don&#039;t do any more though mate cos the h lasts a lot longer than uppers and that&#039;s how people OD. You must be still really up cos H hits you a lot harder when you&#039;ve finished with stims. I can only speak when using coke as the stim but I imagine it&#039;s much the same with drone. <br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;ve just killed your buzz but I&#039;d rather do that than find you&#039;ve disappeared when I log on next ;)

I did another 10mg bump an hour ago, the stims have worn of and I&#039;ll try and describe what I&#039;m feeling to see if you can relate. It&#039;s like warm over my whole body, I&#039;m relaxed, and i have this feeling that i can&#039;t describe, feels like everything is easy going, and even though I&#039;m in my house alone I feel like I&#039;ve got company, as if me and the H are in this together (I know that sounds fucked up) because my whole body is warm with little pulses of pleasure.. as in I&#039;m feeling warm, and I&#039;m getting pulses of euphoria throughout my body. can you relate to that?&nbsp; <br /><br />I can see how this is habit forming, I feel so fucking good, but not in a buzzing away, just peaceful and careless. Holy fuck is the word

				Yep that&#039;s what i found with H, that powders the only company you need. Fucking nice ain&#039;t it. I can&#039;t believe you&#039;ve done 25mg, the bumps I had on Nucleos #4 didn&#039;t even register on my 0.00 scales and they fucked me right up.

I&#039;ve been on two stims and M1 lingers for a while. So does Drone. I&#039;m not stupid though, no more. 25mgs is enough, I&#039;ve heard no 3 just isn&#039;t good when snorted, so its a mixture of stims and gear I guess. Time to chill for a few hours, how long does it last? I&#039;ll not be re-dosing even when it wares off, as I&#039;m going to take EXTREME caution with both having an OD and having an addiction.<br /><br />Yeah mate, just buy Drone when you get paid so you have no money for H. Do you still dabble with it here an there?

I guess me speaking about it isn&#039;t helping, sorry about that, just wanted to speak to an experienced person like yourself about what I&#039;m feeling. Ahhh footie, never really got in to it.
