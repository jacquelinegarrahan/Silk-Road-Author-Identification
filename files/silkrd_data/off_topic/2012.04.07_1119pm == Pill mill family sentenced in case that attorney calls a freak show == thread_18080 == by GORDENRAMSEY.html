				It was called the Focus on Health pharmacy but the enterprise was really focused on making it one of the top pill mills in South Florida. In the single year it was in business, the pharmacy illegally put more than one million oxycodone pain pills on the streets, federal prosecutors said.<br /><br />The illegal aspect of the business was beyond brazen, prosecutor Julia J. Vaglienti said in court.<br /><br />Surveillance videos from the Plantation pharmacy, on the 5300 block of West Broward Boulevard, showed the place operated like an illegal candy story.<br /><br />In court on Friday, prosecutors played videos of drug dealers who showed up daily at the store, threw around stacks of cash and left with thousands of pain pills concealed in brown paper sandwich bags.<br /><br />The drug dealers provided pain pill prescriptions, written by a lone doctor, and used driver&#039;s licenses that belonged to dozens of people who cooperated to make the sales appear legitimate, according to the video and testimony. In one incident that was recorded, five homeless people showed up after the pills had been picked up by the dealers, to sign off on transactions that were made in their names.<br /><br />The drugs were distributed in South Florida and flown throughout the country, prosecutors said.<br /><br />http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-03-30/news/fl-pill-mill-plantation-20120330_1_pain-pills-freak-show-plantation-pharmacy<br /><br />

				A bunch of people getting addicted to pain pills then the source dries up and they are hard to get, so the addicts start using heroin to get their fix.

				H is as popular as ever in South Florida and quality<br />in the Overtown area is fantastic for the most part<br /><br />Price is great as a bundle of 10 bags can be had for $80<br />quite a bargain considering you have a vendors here selling 30mg roxis for $44 each<br />or a loratab for $14
