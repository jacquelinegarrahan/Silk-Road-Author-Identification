				Not that it&#039;s that big of a deal or anything, but I do get kind of tired of when I come to the forum and click on the link for &quot;show new replies to your posts&quot; and things that I really didn&#039;t post much in at all, but are now totally irrelevant to me - such as those &quot;spam to 50, what song are you listening to now?, &quot;Newbie PGP Club&quot; and others like that which may have served their purpose once or twice at one time but I no longer have any interest in keeping up with them.&nbsp; &nbsp; A few days ago when I had a bit of time on my hands, I went to a few of them and tried making some dumb post just so I could get the set of 4 boxes to come up - think they are:&nbsp; &#039;notify&#039;, &#039;return to this post&#039;, &#039;no smilies&#039; and...&nbsp; one other which I forget at the moment.&nbsp; But anyway, I tried unchecking the &#039;notify&#039; and &#039;return to this post&#039; boxes...&nbsp; that didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Also tried changing the tab &quot;notify&quot; to &quot;unnotify&quot; and that didn&#039;t work either.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then I decided I&#039;d spent more than enough time on that...&nbsp; said fuck-it..&nbsp; &nbsp;But now I&#039;ve got a ton of them popping up so as the last bit of time and/or energy I&#039;m spending on a fairly unimportant topic, I&#039;m asking the forum....&nbsp; &nbsp; anyone know?&nbsp; :P

				Sorry foxen, just had a look myself, cause yeah, I know what you mean........ no luck unfortunately.&nbsp; I&#039;m tipping if you go to Account settings &gt; notifications &gt;&nbsp; its one of those but I&#039;m easily confused and my attention span is about 15 seconds.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the IT department when you need them?&nbsp; &nbsp;;) someone will work it out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thanks jonnybones for making the effort. :)&nbsp; But you know... like I said, it&#039;s not really a big deal.... more of a minor nuisance at most.&nbsp; Just thought if there was some simple thing I was overlooking ....&nbsp; oh well..&nbsp; &nbsp;stay cool...&nbsp; I see you a lot in the &quot;family&quot; thread ;D&nbsp; (aka Official Spare Coins Thread) and you seem like good people...&nbsp; +1 to you for making the effort to look into my petty little peeve :)

				Go to the designated thread you longer want to &quot;subscribe&quot; to for lack of a better term. Click &#039;reply&#039; and then un-tick the &#039;Notify me of replies&#039; box underneath the text-input field underneath &#039;Attachments and other options&#039;. <br /><br />Does this work for you? I&#039;m testing out right now, will keep you posted.

				Didn&#039;t work, sorry about that guys. Just a suggestion though. I would love to know how to get around this to as there&#039;s alot of threads that are either dead or I just don&#039;t look at anymore.

				the unsubscribe button doesn&#039;t work so all you can do is delete all the posts you made in that thread.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pain but on the whole the few minutes you spend doing it will remove the ongoing aggravation
