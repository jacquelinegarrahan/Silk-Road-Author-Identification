				Hi, <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I notice a lot of threads with people asking for small amounts of BTC to make up the little missing from there order. Does it bother you?

				I find them somewhat annoying, since they clutter up the discussion page that is supposed to be about talking about SR itself.&nbsp; It only took one person successfully getting a loan before everyone else saw that and realized they could still get the drugs they wanted even though they didn&#039;t calculate for transaction fees properly.

				It is slightly annoying just because I bet a lot of them are people creating accounts for free coin or just doing it for free coin, and not actually come up short this one time. Also, it is annoying when someone asks for a loan and doesn&#039;t return it although I don&#039;t really care about the money, but they should of asked for a gift and I would of gave it to them just the same, but don&#039;t lie.<br /><br />I came up a dollar short today and posted in someone elses loan thread, but no luck. I ended up getting BTCs in my account and making the purchase anyways.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind helping people,&nbsp; but it bothers me knowing that some are probably taking advantage of this and think they are slick.

				Not gonna lie, I&#039;ve been in that situation before. Doesn&#039;t bother me.<br /><br />It&#039;s very easy to miscalculate SR fees and btc vendor fees. Then, on top of that, you have to take into account the bitcoin fluctuation, which can often change value drastically AFTER purchasing your bitcoins.<br /><br />Obtaining bitcoin is a pain in the ass sometimes haha :D

				I don&#039;t mind giving people a little change here and there if I happen to have some left over. I understand that BTC fluctuations can fuck up your plans and it can be a pain in the ass to go through the entire $ to BTC process. If you need an entire BTC on more, then I kinda feel like that&#039;s on you and it was your responsibility to make sure you got some extra BTC into your wallet before making some kind of major purchase. I know some people have actually done the &gt;1BTC loan/payback with interest thing on here with some success, and good for them, but for now I&#039;m only inclined to hand out the occasional $.25 or so. I also feel like you should only need to ask for spare BTC change once. I know there&#039;s no good way to enforce that, but I wish that after coming up short that one time and needing to panhandle on the forums a bit, you&#039;d learn your lesson and make sure to grab some extra BTC next time. <br />

I miscalculated because I didnt know what the shipping cost was going to be. Anyway I would have totally missed out on this awesome deal if not for a kind soul who helped me out (Thanks again Funkynuts!). <br /><br />I placed the order, and its in transit as we speak. I am extremely happy people are willing to look out for each other here, and if it does bother you dont read the post!<br /><br />(Oh btw, my order was the last of the available product and I would have been shit outta luck)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				I think it&#039;s wonderful. Shows what a great and generous community we are. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never needed a loan because I always give myself a little margin to account for BTC fluctuations from the time I order the BTC until the time I actually make a purchase. Therefore I almost always have some left over. I&#039;m inclined to give fractions of a BTC to those who might need it. Haven&#039;t done so yet since I&#039;m usually late to the request. So just recently (as of this morning) I decided I will give some of my leftover BTC change to my favorite vendors as a &quot;tip.&quot; Especially when they do me a kindness. <br /><br />I needed to start this policy since I&#039;m running out of things to buy from warweed&#039;s collection that interest me. ;) That&#039;s where my leftover BTC would often go.
