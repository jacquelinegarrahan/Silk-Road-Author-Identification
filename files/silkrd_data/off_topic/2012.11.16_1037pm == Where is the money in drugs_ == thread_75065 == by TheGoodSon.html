				I am looking to diversify my ring in Q2 of 2013 (early summer). I am currently looking for advice on where the most money is in drugs, be it hash, weed, opiates, coke.. etc. I have access to some of these.<br /><br />Any advice is welcome. Thanks

				Like any business, ask yourself:<br /><br />a) can you source a better quality product and sell for higher price in a high end market? <br />b) source higher quantity and sell at a lower price in low end markets?<br />c) provide a product in a market that has high demand, but low supply (for a higher prices naturally)?<br />d) can you undercut an existing saturated/competitive market with either a lower price OR higher quality product at current market price<br />e) create a new market by sourcing a new product or one that is not easily available (such as Peyote)<br /><br />These questions aren&#039;t based on the name of the drug.

				Well profit margins are correlated to risk involved. higher risk = lower supply = higher profit margins<br /><br />Coke + heroin are always safe bets in that respect.<br /><br />The other driver of profit margins is how complicated manufacturing or acquiring precursor chemicals is. Such as LSD ergot, growing peyote cactuses and most pharma quality pills.<br /><br />Pharmaceutical amphetamines (adderral/ritalin) probably has the best combination of high demand, high price and your customers are rich university educated white kids instead of the usual crackheads and junkies.

				Coke and Heroin profits can be crazy but your clientele is awful. Junkies will always try to pull on over on you. That being said, many dealers of those drugs are just as shady. If I were you, I&#039;d stick to just trying the product when you get it(or have someone else test it). Don&#039;t become a habitual user and you won&#039;t have problems.

				Where is the money in drugs? Wherever the market dictates in your area. Do &quot;market research&quot; first, aka try all the drugs you can find and make note of pricing and availability. Find out what&#039;s least available, most desired, and which drugs have the greatest potential profit margin based on local prices compared to your SR costs. Be sure to include Bitcoin exchange fees and the potential for market fluctuations. Find out which vendors are consistently available and what their prices are. Do calculations using various vendors as well as trying out different prices for different quantities to see how much you can reasonably expect to make.<br /><br />Then you gotta find capital...woo potential investors, rob old ladies, work the corner, etc.

				Yea dude, the absolute best money any drug dealer will see is in the hard shit like blow( hard &amp; soft), dope, and meth. Only those things will bring you a world of hurt beyond anything you can imagine. Im not going to go into detail unless you insist, but just know there really isnt long term money in hustling any drug unless your part of that 1% of drug dealers that do the right thing with their money when they have it. Cause the other 99% of them piss it away as fast as it comes or live hoodrich and end up broke after they pay their first lawyer. <br />&nbsp;If your going to do it, keep it light and happy. Only for living/spending and pocket money whilst working a legit job of any sort for your nest egg or savings. Goodluck!

				MDMA for those on SR. IRL not alot of people do MDMA, unless you go to raves or events.<br /><br />Opiates are good, on SR, and IRL, but you need your own scripts from Pharm, that are cheap, then you&nbsp; flip that.

				Really depends on what you can get cheap.&nbsp; There is a ton of money in coke if you can get it cheap, but then again if you can source MDMA cheaply then you can make profit whereas wee do good if you can get it cheaply.&nbsp; So thats your supply side in a nutshell.<br /><br />As for demand.. being as you cant sell what you dont have access to, why not try selling what you can get and seeing what runs out quickly?<br /><br />Its not rocket science.. if you have to ask then dealing is probably not for you.<br />

				Actually you are dead-wrong regarding Coke. Coca leaves, tea and flour are pretty much readily available to buy if you know where to look. Opium you can make from growing your own poppies. <br /><br />I wasn&#039;t talking about making it in a commercial setting either, I was talking about just doing small-scale reactions and the chemistry for both Cocaine and Heroin aren&#039;t hard at all. So drop the attitude, read what I am actually saying and check your facts. :)<br /><br />And Dank, LSD is quite hard to make yes but what compounds the difficulty is the settings that it needs to be done in.

				I like how people think you have to have a degree to synth chemicals...I&#039;m in the process of learning mda synth and as long as the reactions are explained in a dumbed down way, it&#039;s really not that hard to follow. All you really need is some basic knowledge of how shit works and as long you follow the guide, your good.

				The money could be whatever you can get for cheap and sell for cheaper than other people. Find something lacking in your network, doesnt have to be the best prfoit margin but if it sells quick than go with it. Weed is where it&#039;s at for me, different for everyone though.

				Fentanyl if you can get it or are skilled enough to synthesize it.<br /><br />It&#039;s a reasonable straight forward synth to a SKILLED organic chemist (not to a kitchen chemist or even college grad chemist), just 3 steps:<br /><br />1) N-alkylation of 4-piperidinone HCL<br />2) Reductive amination of the N-phenethyl-4-piperidinone you produced in step 1<br />3) N-acylation of the&nbsp; 4-anilino-N-phenethyl-piperidine you produced in step 2 to yield N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylpropanamide ... more commonly known as Fentanyl :)<br /><br />I won&#039;t tell you which reagents you need to use to alkylate the precursor, reductively aminate NPP (it requires a skilled chemist to do this step though, it can&#039;t be done through simple Sn2 substitution) or N-acylaton of the ANPP. <br /><br />This synth is in the realm of advanced organic synthesis, so any chemist attempting this synth should already know which reagent&#039;s to use to N-alkylate, reductive amination to NPP and N-acylation to ANPP and posses the lab equipment (specialized equipment) to reductively aminate NPP to ANPP.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can find the answers on wiki or some shit (or publications), but again this synth can only be achieved by an advanced organic chemist (I couldn&#039;t do it and i&#039;m an organic chemist among other things :P)<br /><br />Fentanyl is liquid gold, especially on SR, a 100µg fentanyl patch sells for ~$200, so just imagine being able to synth even 10g of it ... that&#039;s $20 000 000 ... for 10 grams :).
