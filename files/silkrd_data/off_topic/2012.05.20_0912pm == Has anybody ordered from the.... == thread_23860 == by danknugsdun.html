				I know that if I had that kind of inventory to move, I would have a site with MUCH better set up. Even if I had to pay someone to do it for me. I don&#039;t buy it. Would anyone actually order anything that expensive from a site that consists of a single page of ASCII?<br /><br />Fuck Apple anyway, they are far too proud of their mediocre products. GD, even a stolen apple computer costs more than a PC with better specs. Then you have to deal with that shit OS.

				I agree that it doesn&#039;t need to be flashy, but there are only a few sentences, in very poor English, on the entire page.

				Re-reading that, damn I do sound like a dick. My apologies. That said, the tone I get from his post to which I replied was inferring that I was being somewhat stupid, and possibly racist for assuming that he wrote the reviews because they sound asian like the rest of the page. That&#039;s not even the case, possibly asian, or middle eastern, or whatever, all I know is it REALLY looks like they were written by &quot;abdul&quot;. His English is so poor that he must not even realize how obvious it is.<br />

				The url given first doesn&#039;t work (mb just for me :3). <br />But anyway has anyone tried this shit? Any updates on the topic? <br />And what is the correct spelling for sellers name. I always hear different variants. The last one was Abudula Hamasaki.

				I say we put a group buy together to see if this pulls through. Item goes to the most reputable person in the group. They sell it on SR, we get close to our money back.<br /><br />If nothing turns up, we go to South Dakota and stanley everyone named Abdulla.<br /><br />Dank
