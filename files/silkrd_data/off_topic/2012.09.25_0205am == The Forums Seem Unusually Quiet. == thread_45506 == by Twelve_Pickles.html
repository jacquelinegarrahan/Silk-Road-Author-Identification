				i dont know if this is just me but why is it a few months ago it seemed like everything on here was buzzing and fizzling away and now its like a western ghost-town with grassballs blowing down empty streets<br /><br />it might just be that the shine of the road and the forums has worn off after 8 months, i hope not...

				Well there aren&#039;t as many trolls to squabble with for one thing, for another the seasons are changing and people&#039;s lives change with them. Most of the big festivals happen during the Summer as well so not as many folks will be tripping for awhile. ;)

				I hope I can safely say G that me and you both WILL be tripping as autumn descends.<br /><br />gotta love the change of seasons for the change of Scenery, how the deciduous trees leaf changes colour and falls has always fascinated me since a child, especially so when tripping =]

Strange, but a good chance for those of us who frequent the forums regularly to get to know each other a little better, I suppose, rather than having to deal with the trolls all day! And the newbies.. Oh god, the newbies..&nbsp; :-\ I mean sure, we were all new here once but some of the newer members just seem to be lacking a single morsel of common sense. The &#039;twen-teenage&#039; generation, I presume; expecting everything to be instant and laid out on a platter before them, and getting ratty when they&#039;re asked to search for 5 seconds to find the information they&#039;re looking for...<br />What is the world coming to?!&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I was thinking the same thing, maybe the rapture happened.&nbsp; Came to a Homeostasis end of last week; about the time all that spam got cleaned up. anyways I had a very good stress relieving morning, my good friend dropped off something nice, was a bit tense cause of operation pangea or whatever.. but everything kosher<br />

				I know a large group of the trolls that sat on here posting all day migrated to IRC. Which I think is a incredibly stupid idea to just sit in IRC all day unless you&#039;re mobile, even if it is encrypted.

				There was talk a few months back about creating a VIP forum to get away from the trolls and spammers.&nbsp; Does anyone know if this ever happened?&nbsp; Not that I expect to get an invite, but it would certainly explain the lull around here lately.
