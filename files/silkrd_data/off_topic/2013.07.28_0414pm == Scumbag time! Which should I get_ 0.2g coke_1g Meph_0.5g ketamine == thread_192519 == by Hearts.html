				Note I&#039;m looking for something to last me, I&#039;m curious to try coke, how many small lines could I make with .2g? (never tried it)<br /><br />And I made meph a choice since its cheap and I&#039;d like something to give me euphoria and 1g could last me a bit of time at least. (never tried it)<br /><br />Ketamine because its been a while and I hear K Queen has quality Ketamine, I missed that K feeling a lot! The warpyness and being able to just stare at the wall and feel amazing.<br /><br />I&#039;m leaning towards ketamine but I&#039;d like to see what others would think :) cheers

				Yeah I&#039;m quite attracted to the idea that it has strong euphoria, and yeah I&#039;m worried of re dosing to much that I&#039;ll have trouble sleeping! Like you said, need to have a strong will

				My advice would be to eat it, I have only ever swallowed meph and while I have certainly wanted to take more, the most I&#039;ve done in a session would be 250 mgs (granted I purposely don&#039;t take it often to keep my tolerance low), but I definitely feel like eating it helps keep the fiending under control.

				Had no problem sleeping after meph thought but only when i had no more...once i railed 2g thought night even thought every like made me feel only worse but i thought when i&#039;ll do next line and it would be bigger, then it would make the euphoria kick in.<br />Dammit these old times :D even had 2x 5g and never swallowed it only snorted :D.<br />Swallowing may be the answer, let us know then! ;)

				A decision between Meth and Ket.<br /><br />I have never liked the idea of meth but you have to think about what you want to try, uppers or downers?<br /><br />Ket is fun if you are going to be doing it on your own, thou again it wont last you very long but its an interesting <br />experience...<br /><br />I can&#039;t say I ever want to try meth to be honest, I like coke, md, ket, alcohol and the occasional psychedelic.<br />Meth has never really fitted into UK culture thank god.<br /><br />Actually why don&#039;t you get some DMT you wont forget it :P&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Think you got it wrong there! I meant mephedrone, not meth haha<br /><br />And actually I have tried DMT, it was one of my first purchases of the road and it was an amazing experience! But I&#039;d just like something I can bump now and then, feel a buzz or euphoria. So its either a stimulant RC like Mephedrone (MCAT, 4mmc) or Ketamine at only 0.5 for a nice disocciative feeling..

				It&#039;s a no brainer in my book. Would go for the mephedrone any day. Have to admit to not being a K user but 1g of meph would go a lot further. You can rail or bomb. For a new user you could have a good couple of nights with 1g. Make 4 caps (approx 200mg each) for bombing and rail the leftover. The other options wouldn&#039;t give you more than one night&#039;s fun I reckon.

				Thanks @fiendish and @snark<br />What do you guys reckon, 5 pills of his meph tabs, then i can crush em to snort? or 1g of his shining powder... I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re the same and is wondering if anyones just taken his pills?<br />Ech I&#039;m feeling like I want the ketamine though I miss the feeling, I&#039;m pretty sure .5g would only last 2 sessions at the very max :\<br /><br />I&#039;m getting lots of + for meph, wondering where all the Ket lovers are to back it up 8) would like to see both sides :P

				In regards to the mephedrone have tried both. Skip the shining powder, the pills are far better. Two pills and you&#039;ll be roaring. Others have given good reports on crushing a pill and snorting also.

				Mephedrone will be the best value for money. 1 gram goes a long way. But good luck not going through at least half a g ram, if not the entire gram in one sitting.<br />While you&#039;re on it, you have a strong desire to redose. IMO even stronger than cocaine. Cocaine and meph are different, but both make you feel great, in a different way. Meph will fuck you up a little. Eye wiggles and the rush is good when you snort it.<br />The coke will be more fully clear headed. it&#039;s weird because whilst I&#039;m on meph, it seems more addictive, but normally I would think about coke, not meph. it&#039;s because coke works more on dopamine which has a higher addiciton potetial than serotonin releases, which is what mephedrone works most on, as well as dopamine.<br /><br />I&#039;d go the meph if I were you.

The incident occurred in Australia in 1980 - a baby disappeared under mysterious circumstances near Uluru (Ayers Rock). The mother, Lindy Chamberlain, camping with her family, claimed to have seen a dingo carrying her baby from their tent, and immortalised the phrase, &quot;The dingo&#039;s got my baby!&quot;. She was convicted of murdering her baby but later acquitted when new evidence suggested that the baby was, in fact, killed by a dingo.&quot;

I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll go with the meph pills then, Btw love your name Dingo haha, wait so on meph you would think about coke :o, interesting, i&#039;ll try my best to be as scummy as I can to make it last at least 3 good sessions, or 4 at the max (I bet this would be easier said than done from all the advice given :P)?&nbsp; and Fiendish thanks for assuring me to get the pills :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Oh no, I meant whilst I&#039;m high on coke, I don&#039;t have the desire to redose with more coke as much as if I was on mephedrone. On mephedrone, my desire to redose is high.<br />So IMO when you are high on meph, it is more addictive than coke. But if I am sober and thinking about drugs, the coke has more of an appeal to me. It&#039;s hard to explain.<br />The fact is that both are addictive, but cocaine is probably more addictive due to the way it works. Dopamine releasing drugs are more addictive than serotonin releasing drugs.<br />Cocaine releases mostly lots of dopamine, whereas mephedrone releases serotonin and dopamine, but not as much dopamine as cocaine. They are different.<br />Cocaine is more of a &quot;feel awesome&quot; drug. Where mephedrone is more like &quot;feel good and happy as well.&quot; it&#039;s difficult to explain. You really need to have tried both to understand.<br /><br />Enjoy it anyway. And haha glad you like the name. I get that all the time...<br />Do you know what it refers to? A while ago in Australia someone&#039;s baby got taken by a baby and there is the phrase &quot;a dingo ate my baby.&quot;<br />Google it for the article.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ahh I see I understand, watched a shit ton of documentaries on drugs at one point, I guess you can say the meph gives a little bit of an MDMA high(minor one) with the &quot;awesome feeling&quot; from the dopamine, but not as much dopamine. One day I&#039;ve got to buy some coke and have a couple of beers with it, I hear alcohol and coke makes &quot;Cocaethylene&quot; when consuming both, yeah I guess blood pressure is an issue but theres a reason people enjoy the two!<br /><br />Well Wertu used to have pre ban meph I think, but I was hearing that his only powder form of meph is a &quot;shining powder&quot; which isn&#039;t really strong, or his yabba dabba doo rocks which are good but a little more costly, then theres his pills which are 210-230 mg I think, and people are telling me its different from the shining powder and I intend on getting them and just crushing them to snort.<br /><br />Hahahhaha I think I&#039;ve read this somewhere a while back! got it from urban dictionary<br /><br />&quot;refers to the Azaria Chamberlain disappearance. The incident occurred in Australia in 1980 - a baby disappeared under mysterious circumstances near Uluru (Ayers Rock). The mother, Lindy Chamberlain, camping with her family, claimed to have seen a dingo carrying her baby from their tent, and immortalised the phrase, &quot;The dingo&#039;s got my baby!&quot;. She was convicted of murdering her baby but later acquitted when new evidence suggested that the baby was, in fact, killed by a dingo.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ok so you snort mephedrone. About 2 mins later you get a cocaine like rush, with a hint of MDMA feeling. Then t hecocaine rush feeling dies off after about 2-4 mins and it feels like a very mild cocaine high + about 1/3 of the typical MDMA high.<br />You even get eye wiggles from mephedrone like you do from MDMA. You need a decent dose though. If I were you, I&#039;d snort 50mg to start with and go from there. Just don&#039;t overdo it..<br /><br />Yea I&#039;m aware of cocaethylene too,, but coke + alcohol is just so good I kind of ignore that. I only use coke every 2-3 months anyway, so it can&#039;t be THAT bad for me.<br />I take it you live in Europe? Or the US? Or elsewhere?...<br /><br />Haha yep that&#039;s the dingo story! it is so well known in Australia. It was later proven she was innocent. Poor lady.
