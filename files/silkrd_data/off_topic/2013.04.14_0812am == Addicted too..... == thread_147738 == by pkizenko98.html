				Hi, my name&#039;s Fallkniven and I&#039;m addicted to Silk Road.<br /><br />I have weeds in my garden that are 4 feet tall, my family has disowned me after I offered to sell them some MDMA I bought off a SR vendor, I got kicked out of college for turning up stoned off my tits and I lost my job at McDonalds for selling drugs to friends in the bathroom.<br /><br />But none of that stuff bothers me anymore thanks to this thread.

				About the only time I haven&#039;t been addicted to the forums is when I&#039;ve become disgusted with my own drug use, and thereby disgusted by (largely) drug talk. But that&#039;s on me, and rare.<br /><br />I get the honesty thing, and it&#039;s a big part of why I like to post as well as read here, because I can be 100% myself instead of whatever percent the societally acceptable bits add up to.<br /><br />I find the friend thing tough for other reasons but what I *really* find difficult is trying to find and keep relationships when your life has a little-understood drug component. I can&#039;t &quot;come out of the closet&quot;, drug-wise, so that means starting from a position of dishonesty toward people until I (think I) have them sussed out. Which isn&#039;t a great way to start a relationship.
