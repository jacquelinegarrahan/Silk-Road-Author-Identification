				Idk if you&#039;re trolling or not bro, but I don&#039;t think you sent anything,the amount hasn&#039;t changed. So if anyone reads this,and would consider sending .50 cents, I&#039;d appreciate it so much for reals! :)

				BUMP<br /><br /><br />Sorry to come across as a troll guys, I&#039;ve never asked for anything on here eer and it&#039;s my nature to do so.<br /><br />My situation is this: If I could obtain just .50 cents, I&#039;ll be able to complete my order. It really doesnt make sense to Moneypak this, you know what I mean. I wont be able to get coinage until a couple weeks from now so I&#039;d prefer to borrow,or more likely be given .50, but if it means as much to you to be paid back as it is me asking I will definitely do that when I can. Thanks to anyone considering offering me an assist!

				Wasta helped this guy out , but only for 25 cents.<br />So an other 25 cents and then he has his 50 cents.<br /><br />@ The showcase himself, I do want it back!<br /><br />A few weeks, are in my book no more then 4 or 5 weeks at most.<br /><br />Wasta<br /><br />

				Wasta, if you truly did, I thank you man, and will pay you back more than .25 cents in about 2 weeks. No more than 3 though for sure.<br /><br />I&#039;m a little confused because someone generously donated more than .50, I refreshed my SR tab after I read this and had $1.90(usd) added [more than I requested] so I appreciate if it was you, or if it was someone else just trying to make someone&#039;s day better and didn&#039;t care to mention their good deed. Whoever it was thank you. My situation is so bad that even this means a lot. I appreciate it, now my order has been placed.<br /><br />Thanks again wasta and the mysterious donor :)<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT [MINUTES LATER]: Ok I see what happened, and again thank you Wasta bro! You donated .25 bitcoins, I just needed .50 cents (USD), so idk if it was misunderstood or difficult to calculate how much it is in bitcoins (like .02? not sure lulz), but regardless I appreciate it and will pay you back more than the $1.90 (usd / .25 in btc) you gave me! I appreciate you man. Thank you.<br />
