				Hello all, been a while since I&#039;ve posted as I&#039;ve really been busy with school, no time to buy personal amounts of drugs..ha. Anyway I check my mail the other day like any normal citizen and what do I find? A love letter from customs telling me 1.3 grams of ketamine was intercepted at the Chicago customs place addressed to me. Now I have NEVER ordered ketamine. I haven&#039;t even &quot;ordered&quot; anything for over 3 months from overseas, much less illegal drugs.<br /><br />My question: How the fuck did this happen?

				&nbsp;:o<br />Only thing I could think of is..<br />You ever volunteer for a free sample of something back in the day?&nbsp; Maybe was an LE phishing for addresses?

				Nope, never a free sample of Ketamine. And there are only a few overseas vendors that carry ketamine that could possibly have my address..

				Odd situation you are in.&nbsp; As far as I know Love Letters might be frightening, but ends there.&nbsp; Now if you get some product that you didn&#039;t order defiantly do not open it.&nbsp; That would be a controlled delivery.&nbsp; Continue with school my friend and lay low.&nbsp; Best wishes to you!

				Just ignore the letter. And like bolovide said, don&#039;t open anything you might receive unexpectedly, saince it might be a controlled delivery. Refuse to receive it, or if it gets dropped in your doorway, just leave the unopened box somewhere, maybe with a post-it on it reminding you to go by the post office and ask them what the fuck. That way if LE show up with a search warrant, you can give back the box and ask them to GTFO.

				Have you ordered something that could be looked like Ketamine?&nbsp; LE aren&#039;t known to be the smartest people in the world (requirements to get into the field are a joke)... you might as well order xanax, get it seized and they write down &#039;ecstasy&#039;.&nbsp; The previous advices were pretty spot on.&nbsp; Be cautious.&nbsp;
