				There seems to be a lot of aggression and bad vibes around here. I say there needs to be a place where we can discuss whatever we want and say some pretty deranged shit. Discuss religion, vendors, politicians, economic systems, etc. Hell, call me a pedophile if it makes you feel any better. I&#039;ll retaliate if that&#039;s the case of course, so troll at your own risk.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start. I eat too many cheeseburgers, and I think I&#039;ve been taking entirely too much Etizolam at night lately. I&#039;ve woken up several times the next morning and looked at some of the crazed shit I&#039;ve said on here with amazement and confusion. God damn weird legal benzos. <br /><br />I fucking hate Mormons. I love watching bootleg TV shows and movies, fuck cable. A really fat chick tricked me into letting her give me a blowjob once, then I fucked her out of pity because she started crying and said her boyfriend used to beat her. I became pretty cynical after that incident.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think Jesus is a glorified zombie from space. Sometimes I&#039;ll sleep well past noon. I like to listen to rain noises whist I slumber. Etizolam is a weird drug. Some sort of anti-depressant benzo analogue. <br /><br />I have a cool cat. He eats butter if he can find it. Bad kitty. <br /><br />I have AIDS, here, have one of my AIDS burgers. No ketchup? Fuck you asshole.

				You mean a big women!<br /><br />As for her tricking you - please tell&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />She said she was going to adjust your fly - or wanted to see if your shorts needed cleaning?<br /><br />Or are you saying the chick had a dick and maybe told you she had a big clit?<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />As for trolls - bastards.<br /><br />They can all suck my manhood - or perhaps not because you would have a bunch of trolls sucking it constantly and it would lose the magic of the first time a passing troll handed oot blowjobs.<br /><br />Maybe this thread is a Freudian slip and the author wants to give head for BTC.<br /><br />Well my dick has Mrs Red tattooed on it - actually I got a 100 line poem on there plus all manner of stuff including a big ganga leaf and two eyes for my balls.<br /><br />So stop hitting on people like this man!

				Ah, Red. You deranged son of a bitch. I was hoping someone would post something here. I was hanging out with this woman from Craigslist, and we were watching a movie. I posted an ad for cuddling, being an obnoxious troll that I am. Weirdly I&#039;m somewhat talented as a writer, and received many replies, so I fucked a bunch of women in my mansion full of drugs and guns for awhile. <br /><br />She said I was a liar who didn&#039;t want cuddles. Then she started playing with my meat. I was just trying to be polite and friendly, then out comes the penis and she tricked me. She knowingly used my kindness against me. I became bitter and added a no fat chick policy to my ad. She told me she fucked a man with a strapon once, so I never answered her phone calls again. <br /><br />I think a woman should be obligated to tell you her weight in a personal ad. That woman employed some trick photography on me. I&#039;m not too picky, but god damn that was a big bitch. She used photographic trickery and a sob story on me. She&#039;s a penis con artist. She had a box of Magnum condoms with her. What the fuck kind of horse dicks was she involved with? I mean, one fit me rather well, but why the Magnums? I have never seen a woman who carries around Magnum condoms to this day. Big vag having con artist.. <br /><br />One time when I was fucking around with benzos during college I woke up naked in my living room after a night of partying, I was missing my wallet and some Viagra, and found a woman in the driveway asleep in her car with her pants on backwards. We became quite close after that. I thought I was robbed, and grabbed a gun running around the house looking for ninjas. <br /><br />Moral of the story. Don&#039;t mix Xanax and Klonopin with Viagra. You&#039;ll wake up with a slutty Craigslist girlfriend.

				I quite like fat chicks to a point... But I sort of got sleep raped by a fat chick once.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />My friend was fucking her friend so I agreed to humor this fat chick (too fat for my tastes, i mean fucking morbidly obese). So my friend invited his lady back to our pad. This obese chick came to chill in my room and I wasn&#039;t interested but she gave me this sob story about how she had just got out of jail for beating some girl almost to death, I was slightly alarmed but heavily sedated at this point so for some reason I decided to take off her clothes...&nbsp; :o This only acted to sure my instinctive repulsion towards this lady... It was shortly after that I blacked out.<br /><br />Earlier I had been drinking in a shitty bar , had taken some MDMA and finished the night off with some some shitty street coke, a few diazepam and some booze when I got back to my room. <br /><br />I was slowly roused at around 5am; first light of a hot and humid summer day, my level of consciousness was faint but my memory of waking hot,sweaty and with some pubic skin irritation was SO vivid I can feel it 10 years later. When I regained basic mental faculties I became aware of a huge heavy figure on top of me, grinding away like some frustrated piece of factory hardware. For some reason I was hard and allowed this to continue against my will for several minutes whilst full consciousness was restored.

				Good god man that was dark. At least I feel some sense of relief knowing I&#039;m not the only one that&#039;s been sexually abused by an obese woman under false pretenses. That shit is mentally damaging. I&#039;d rather fuck the spraypainted dirty mexican zebra donkey than be raped by that big gapey mess of a woman again. We were watching some sort of fucked up movie about this Frenchman that was straight killin&#039; bitches and turning them into purfume. Then out comes the sad story and meat rubbing. I&#039;m a pretty cynical bastard, but i just felt so damn guilty I let her ride me until she was done and I went home and washed my balls with about a liter of soap and cried and did more drugs.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				I find amputees, and especially quadruple amputees, to be really sexy. The way the shape of woman changes while she remains entirely functional (limbs aren&#039;t necessary to survive) is just amazing. I think there&#039;s nothing more beautiful than a limbless woman torso to fuck. :)

				Hmmm, how do I say this......Guess coming right out and saying it is best.<br /><br />I bought a slave girl. You may live comfortable in your belief that slavery is dead but I can tell you it is alive and kicking.<br /><br />Note: she is over 20, girl just sounded better than woman or lady and is used in reference to her position in my house.&nbsp; ;)

				I once had a girlfriend that would encourage sexual encounters with other men and ugly/fat women. To the best of my knowledge, the farthest that ever got was half a handie (up through my pant leg) at a party.&nbsp; To this day I&#039;m not sure if she got off on the sexual aspect, or me being uncomfortable :/<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve never told anyone this before, but I did drugs once

				I hate fucking Mormons too, but then I am a Mormon so I hate myself, far too often. I just can&#039;t seem to quit being one though. I don&#039;t know what it is about them that I hate so much, but I do, God damn it, I do. <br /><br />Jesus? Now that&#039;s some ridiculous shit. Religion is like really bad drugs. They kill you deader than fuck and there is no resurrection. At least with good drugs you get to enjoy the high. With religion its like one long assed migraine interspersed with bouts of Russian roulette.<br /><br />Fuck TV. There never seems to be anything on, yet when I go to my friend&#039;s house I can&#039;t take my eyes off of it. Why are all the good programs on at his house?<br /><br />I have a lingering nightmare of a diabetic chick I used to fuck. She would make me shoot her up, then I would shoot up, but my shit was better than hers. Mine killed the pain while I cannot imagine any greater pain than being her. Fucking her was like rubbing my dick with a sheet of 60 grit sandpaper. I vaguely remember blowing my wad in her face after telling her her pussy was to dry. After I left I felt ambivalent.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have AIDS but I do have a hair piece. Please take my hairpiece. I give you my hairpiece.

				Who asked you? I didn&#039;t ask you to evaluate my religious preference. Mormons get to have lots of wives. That can be a good thing if you have a lot of hot bitches but have you seen Mormon women? If the bitch was a horse I&#039;d have shot her rather than mount her.<br /><br />Besides I changed my mind.

				Hmm. Trolling, or just 10 Random Sick Things About Me?<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of a fantasy of mine to pull on a strap on and give a guy a good plastic dicking. Not &quot;kind of&quot; a fantasy. A real big one. But I have a sort of obsession with men&#039;s asses, which is apparently deviant for women. I don&#039;t see how.
