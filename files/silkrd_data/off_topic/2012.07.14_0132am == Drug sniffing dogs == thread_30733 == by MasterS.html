				http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-01-06/news/ct-met-canine-officers-20110105_1_drug-sniffing-dogs-alex-rothacker-drug-dog<br /><br />So do people think more often than not that dogs are ill trained for the position or are handlers utilizing a dog to justify profiled searches?<br /><br />I personally would prefer much more data than the narrow scope used for the article but I&#039;m glad the issue was made public so more people will keep an eye out.<br /><br />*disclaimer - I know the article isn&#039;t that recent but new to me and was interested in insight.

				The truth is that most handlers are as poorly trained as the dogs. More often than not the handler works the dog to the point that he can get it to give a false positive and justify a search. I know people who train both the dogs and the handlers and it is a major problem.<br /><br />But the courts still take the dogs alerting as gospel.

				I&#039;ve had friends get screwed over by this bullshit.&nbsp; Just use it as an excuse to search a car, doesn&#039;t matter if the dog signals or not.

				In my part of the world, it is not uncommon to have sniffer dogs on public transport and for the pigs to be walking around with them outside clubs on the weekends. Luckily it doesn&#039;t happen all that often, but it is highly publicized when it does. This has led to a well know case where a girl necked all her pills to avoid the dogs and died.
