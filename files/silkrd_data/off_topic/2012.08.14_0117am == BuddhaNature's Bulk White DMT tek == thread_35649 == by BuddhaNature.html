				Hey guys&nbsp; :) <br /><br />So I&#039;ve closed up my DMT shop for good, and I now it&#039;s time for me to share my secret recipe. Over the past few months I&#039;ve pulled almost a half kilo of snow white DMT doing exactly this.<br /><br />Buy:<br /><br />Hardware store:<br />At least one 5 gallon bucket<br />VM&amp;P Naphtha<br />NaOH (If you can&#039;t find it, check craigslist. If you still can&#039;t find it, get it online.)<br /><br />Grocery Store<br />A big ladle/spoon<br />At least two 2.5 gallon water dispensers (the one with the spout on the bottom, should be with the water bottles)<br />1L Pyrex measuring cup<br />.25L Pyrex measuring cup<br />Funnel<br />Coffee filters<br /><br />Other:<br />Sodium carbonate (Pool store, called &quot;pH up&quot;)<br />Mimosa hostilis root bark powder (online)<br />Surgical mask (optional, a bandana or t-shirt also works)<br /><br />Do:<br /><br />Put 11L of water in each bucket<br />Put ~1.7lb of NaOH in each bucket and mix well. Be really careful with this stuff. Wear glasses, gloves, and a long sleeved shirt.<br />Put 2.5 pounds of Mimosa in each bucket and mix well. Make sure to break up all clumps. Wear your mask for this, because the powder will irritate your respiratory system.<br />Put 500-700mL of naphtha in each bucket and mix well.<br />Give the naphtha 15-30 minutes to fully separate.<br />Just barely dunk the small Pyrex cup in so that mostly naphtha flows in<br />Pour this into the water dispenser. This is where you will collect all your DMT-infused naphtha.<br />Remove all the naphtha from all the buckets. Put another 500-700 in each and repeat.<br />Do a total of 4 cycles on each bucket. Keep collecting your infused naphtha in the water dispenser(s).<br />Make a mixture of about 50mL of NaCO3 and .75L of hot water, and mix it well. Dump it into the water dispenser.<br />Put the top on and shake like crazy. Shake it in all directions for at least a minute. This is the secret step that removes the orange/yellow.<br />Give it 5 minutes for the water to fall to the bottom.<br />Turn the water dispenser over and drain out the bottom layer using the spout.<br />Repeat the NaCO3 washing process once more.<br />Do the washing process one more time but this time with plain cold water<br />When you drain from the spout this last time, there should be nothing left in there but naphtha. There shouldn&#039;t be anything floating around at the bottom.<br />Put the spout back on, wash off the dispenser and throw it in the freezer for 16 hours.<br />Pour out all the naphtha through a coffee filter and funnel into another water dispenser.<br />Once all the naphtha is gone, cut open the water dispenser and scrape out your beautiful DMT.<br />Leave it in front of a fan for the night and the next morning you&#039;ll have some snow ready to be used. No recrystallization necessary.<br /><br />The naphtha is completely reusable, but you&#039;ll have to buy more each time due to evaporation and whatever doesn&#039;t separate to the top in time.<br /><br />Each bucket that you do should get you about 16g of nice white DMT. You can pretty much do as many buckets as you want.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s pretty much it. This is what I&#039;ve been doing every week for the last 3 months to give you guys awesome DMT!<br /><br />Spread the love!&nbsp; ;)

				where do you get your powdered root bark. I know it sounds dumb but we made a batch with root bark powder that I bought on ebay and it had some sort of activity but we ended up with a small final amount and idk what ever really happened to the rest but it sure as hell wasn&#039;t like the smutty yellow I got from moon unit

				This tek is good.&nbsp; Although when I when I was selling dmt I just did the stb (straight to base) tek and didn&#039;t do any of the NaCO3 washes.&nbsp; you can get pretty good dmt doing that. This is the tek I used and It&#039;s pretty much the same as mentioned here http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Noman%27s_tek&nbsp; -- note that everything can be scaled to the size you want. there really is no reason to buy dmt when it is so easy to make youselft&nbsp; much cudos to buddanature for sharing his tek.&nbsp;

				Man i cant thank BuddaNature enough for this tek!!!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I have tried DMT on several occasion over the years but never had a supply, so it seemed to slip my mind alot-------&nbsp; &nbsp; Well after i found this tek and saw how simple it was to make i started digging..... <br /><br />After reading up on dmt-nexus.me (clear-net site) and getting a better idea what BuddhaNature was talking about in his tek (not that it was confusing, i just have very limited chemistry skills) i made my own batch and let me tell you, I FUCKING LOVE this stuff, cant believe it took me so long to figure-out how to make this easy compound!!!<br /><br />But after my first try i only yielded 7g.....&nbsp; i have a few ideas how to improve the next yielded but i would really like to know the best place to order my mimosa bark from!!! i know i can find it with a Google search (bc i already have) but i would like to know the community&#039;s opinion!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />hazed&nbsp;

				My changa recipe was pretty simple:<br /><br />Mix 5 parts DMT, 7 parts herb (I used damiana), and 3 parts 10x syrian rue extract into enough isopropyl alcohol to cover the entire mixture. I found it useful to dissolve in the powders first and then drop the herb in once everything is fully dissolved.<br /><br />Give it a few hours to soak up the alcohol and stir every 10 minutes or so. Once there&#039;s no more free liquid at the bottom, spread everything out onto a flat surface and let it fully fan dry overnight.<br /><br />Done&nbsp; ;D

				nothing secret about this, just a basic straight to base extractions, theres much more effective ways of doing extractions from MHRB on a large scale (i.e FASA)<br /><br />btw it&#039;s NaHCO3 and not naco3<br />
