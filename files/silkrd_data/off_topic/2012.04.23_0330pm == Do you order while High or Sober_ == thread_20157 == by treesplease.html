				I always order sober... I get very paranoid that I&#039;ve typed my address in wrong when I&#039;m high. However, I&#039;m always high when I post on these forums :D (Oh and when I say high I didn&#039;t mean in weed) not my thing.

				I smoke weed a lot, so a majority of the time i&#039;m stoned, which definitely isn&#039;t the wisest of choices. <br /><br />Same with real life drug deals, being stoned an not as aware has fucked shit up for me once or twice, but horribly fucked shit up. <br /><br />Lesson:Don&#039;t fuck around with business shit when your fucked, especially IRL

				the two mistakes ive ever made on here were while high as shit smoking a joint while ordering. once i fucked up and forgot to encrypt my address which really sketched me out till my order arrived safe n sound. the other time was a few days ago whole preping for the 420 sale i fucked up my mp code while doing my exchange with btc buddy. dude was a pro and canceled my order and messaged me about what happened and we had it fixed in time for me to partake in all the good sale deals. lesson learned to myself this shit is too important, so i get fucked up after i order just so im not having to question if i fucked up my address or anything. i do love smoking a joint while surfing through the forums seems.

				If I&#039;m not 100% sober (okay, maybe like 80%) then I usually just come here on the forums and chat. :) Great people, some assholes, always good to help someone out. Then, after I&#039;ve been distracted by the forums for a bit and have sobered up, if I need to place an order, I do. If I don&#039;t, I just browse pics and make a mental shopping list of what I want, like 500tabs of DudeRugs 25i on KoolAid blotter. :D

				i don&#039;t think about it as business, more like going to the grocery store. <br /><br />you go to the grocery store hungry you&#039;re gonna want everything in site, like little snacks and put a lot more in your basket. <br />for me, being high on here is like being full at the grocery store. it makes me think about the week ahead and what not.

				I smoke too much to be truly sober anyhow but I would never order on speed or MDMA or coke!! Stimulants are the worse for the impulse buying. For example if I snorted some brilliant cocaine then I might order an 8-ball before I even think about it in depth!<br /><br />Speed I would likely roam all over the site picking up impulse bargains.<br /><br />MDMA I&#039;d feel the love and want to buy off everyone!<br /><br />With weed I make rational well thought ought decisions. I come to the forums and search for reviews of the substances and vendors. I rely so much on other users here&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I spend a lot of time researching the reviews on the forums plus the feedback for each product. I look for sellers with a good rep but will always make a small purchase from new vendors if the price is right or the product hard to source.<br /><br />High on weed I read all the entire coke review thread plus the review threads for the sellers&nbsp; ;) High on coke I&#039;d be looking to grab 8-balls and be leering over the 5 gram deals. With weed I chose a couple of grams of coke off two different sellers. I will not be wasting my time looking at SR when high on coke. Good coke makes me want to go out and drink a few beers with company. With coke I would not read any reviews and would likely just go for the top seller and buy more than I can afford. That is why I will never shop on coke. Plus I use it maybe three times a year tops. I plan to keep it that way although with a few festivals coming up I guess I can double the quota for the years I never took any.<br /><br />Speed is more a clean the entire house drug than buy online. With speed its either cleaning, being creative or going to the pub. <br /><br />I do all my shopping when high. Almost everything I buy gets used. I do make the odd impulse buy stoned and generally its gadgets that I go for or clothes. I wear everything I buy also.<br /><br />I like buying drugs when high using the internet and sitting back smoking a fatty whilst listening to some sounds or watching some funny sitcom.<br /><br />I love it when I buy MDMA and it is turns out to really be MDMA. In my area you can get 3 pills for £5 or about 1.5 BTC. The pills are some RC I guess but I never buy unknown pills and do not trust pill reviews as every good pill produced is immediately replicated. I trust the reviews here by real live people who sometimes really make an effort to describe the effect of the drug and the aftermath which is actually very easy-going compared to other drugs.<br /><br />The best way to buy something is to actually sleep on the purchase. Sometimes you know what you want regardless of being high. Festival coming up and you want certain things. <br /><br />I like to watch my BTC and always look for a bargain. I am not afraid to buy out of the UK but first time UK buyers will likely buy off UK vendors. With MDMA Ivory is the top seller for the UK. A bit pricey IMO but I understand why&nbsp; ;) I would not want to be sitting with a few kilos of E and thousands of envelopes and packing material. With drugs its the risk factor that is reflected in prices. Many products here can be sourced on the street but the street is a jungle and pure drugs are so rare many users spend half their life talking about the one time they did land some primo H or coke or E.<br /><br />Sober or high SR does offer buyers a lot of safety if we follow some simple rules. Rule No 1 is to do a search on vendors before you buy something. Try to get some feedback on the product you want to purchase. If your unsure about anything then post up your fears here and maybe we can sooth your worried mind.<br /><br />I guess the worse drug to use purchasing would be LSD.<br /><br />You might think that buying drugs is like a cosmic game and end up with a basket that would make Keith Richards say &#039;that is way too much man&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />

				I&#039;m a hallucinogen man and I don&#039;t fuck around. When I&#039;m tripping, I can&#039;t even decide if I have a body, much less if I want to purchase chemicals which I may or may not place inside said body.
