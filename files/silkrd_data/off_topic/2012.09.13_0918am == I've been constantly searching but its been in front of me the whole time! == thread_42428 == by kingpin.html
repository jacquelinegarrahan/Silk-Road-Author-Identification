				Ive been searching for the best drug and in my travels I found that it was literally right in front of my the whole time. It is of course MDMA, nothing compares to it. <br /><br />How soon after a roll can I re-roll?<br /><br />Oh I&#039;m rolling solo, any suggestions on music or anything to enhance prolong my high?<br /><br />EDIT - A song that chills to the core - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY0EN_PWh3o

				To each is their own. I personally don&#039;t think there is a single perfect drug, instead I look at it like a toolbox. What do I need to accomplish? What mood/setting will I be taking this in and in what way will I want to enhance the moment? <br /><br />So far my favorites are 2cb, n20, and opiates. <br /><br />As far as music to listen to, stick with upbeat stuff. I enjoy Passion Pit, Muse, jungle DnB and swing music.

				Its perfect for any situation though. <br /><br />n20?<br /><br />I bought the new passion pit album and it really sucks apart from is called &quot;take a walk&quot; and one other song, its bad :( not like their previous. Im really looking forward to Yeasayers new album. <br /><br />Listening to Mealingus right now (metal)

				My gf who never takes drugs (apart from wine) is very against them but knows I use them occasionally. So I offered one Aaturday night that she has wine and i have some mdma, recon this would be a good idea?&nbsp; Anyone ever done such a thing?

				Yeah, I heaven&#039;t heard their new stuff yet. Still jamming to their old album.<br /><br />Anyways, n20 is nitrous or &quot;whip its&quot;/&quot;laughing gas&quot;. It&#039;s a great temporary high that leaves this nice buzzing feeling. Also it&#039;s great for a summer day in a park cause after you crack one of the canisters it&#039;s all nice and ice cold. <br /><br />As for your GF situation, I have had similar events work out just fine. Just remember that your mdma is going to hit faster and last shorter than her drinking. <br /><br />Oh and as for your reroll question. I usually redose about once or twice a night if my roll wears off but after that I take a break for about a month to be on the safe side. Don&#039;t burn your brain brain out! Also don&#039;t forget to pick up some 5htp from the drug store as it will help reknew the brain chemicals you are using up when you roll.

				5htp is just that, 5htp. It&#039;s a vitamin you pick up from the store. It helps with sleep and helps with serotonin loss.
