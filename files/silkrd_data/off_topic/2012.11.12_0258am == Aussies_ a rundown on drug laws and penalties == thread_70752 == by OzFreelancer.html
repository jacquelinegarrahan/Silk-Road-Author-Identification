				There seems to be a bit of confusion among Aussie buyers as to just what offences they are committing when purchasing from Silk Road.&nbsp; I thought I would start a new thread on it (note: I am not a criminal lawyer and this info should be taken as guidance only; if you are busted, consult a suitably qualified lawyer immediately).<br /><br />Anyone who knows my work knows I am a drug reform advocate.&nbsp; My personal stance is legislate/regulate/educate ALL drugs.&nbsp; So do I agree with these offences? No.&nbsp; But I think it is important that you know the possible consequences of buying here so you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />STATE OFFENCES<br /><br />Most drug laws fall under State law.&nbsp; The most relevant ones are possession and trafficking.&nbsp; Amounts of drugs are divided into ‘small’, ‘traffickable’ and ‘commercial’ quantities.<br /><br />The limits for a prima facie case of trafficking differ from state-to-state but are mostly around the 2g-3g for the popular powders and 250g for cannabis.&nbsp; Commercial quantities are around the 500g mark for powders and 25kg for cannabis.&nbsp; Tasmania is the most generous state with regards to what is regarded as a traffickable amount.<br /><br />A prima facie case does not necessarily mean you will be charged with trafficking – if you can prove that the drugs are for personal use only, the charge will be downgraded to possession.<br /><br />The penalty for mere possession of cannabis or THC is a penalty of around $675. For a first-time offender, the most likely penalty is a good behaviour bond, which means no conviction so long as you comply with the terms of the bond (which may be attending a drug diversion program or making a donation to charity). There is also a cannabis cautioning scheme and first-timers are usually just cautioned.<br /><br />For other drugs, the maximum penalty for possession is a fine of around $4000 or one year&#039;s imprisonment, or both.<br /><br />For trafficking offences of non-commercial quantities, the maximum penalty is a jail term of 15 years or a fine of up to $240,000, or both.&nbsp; It is higher for trafficking to a person under 18.<br /><br />Penalties for trafficking of commercial quantities are a maximum term of 25 years prison or a fine of $400,000, or both.<br /><br />FEDERAL OFFENCES<br /><br />When importing drugs from overseas, you need to also consider the federal offences.&nbsp; Importing drugs under the Criminal Code is divided into importing a personal quantity, importing a marketable quantity and importing a commercial quantity.<br /><br />&#039;Marketable quantity&#039; for the most common drugs is 2g and above.&nbsp; Where a marketable quantity is involved the applicable penalty is 25 years imprisonment or $550,000, or both. For commercial quantities it&#039;s life imprisonment.&nbsp; Again, there is the &quot;lack of commercial intention&quot; defence:&nbsp; This requires the accused to prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she neither intended to sell any of the drugs, nor believed that another person intended to sell any of the drugs. However, where this defence is raised, and accepted by a jury, the accused may be convicted of an offence with a two year penalty or $44,000, or both.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the relevant part of the Criminal Code.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp;

A first offender is probably unlikely to cop anywhere near the maximum. However, there is always the possibility that there will be a deterrence factor to early Silk Road-related penalties.<br /><br />Any attempt to perform any of the above (possession/trafficking) carries the same penalties as the offences themselves.<br /><br />There are no doubt other laws that would be relevant (including conspiracy and probably misuse of the postal service), but I&#039;ve just concentrated on the drug laws.<br /><br />Happy to answer any questions you might have to the best of my ability, but like I said, I’m not a criminal lawyer, so please don’t take anything I say as gospel. :)<br /><br />

				Great idea for a thread. <br /><br />Another thing to note is the Criminal Code 1995 (federal act) has an analogue law - anything that is deemed structurally similar to currently prohibited drugs is also illegal and punishable under that act. Different states and territories have different analogue laws too to complicate matters. I do have one friend who was charged with importing mephedrone (not through SR; just a website) and he was charged with a federal offence using the analogues clause. He had good lawyers and got out with a fine and conviction, but no jail. He only ordered 2 grams - and it was only for personal use, but he still ended up with criminal conviction... the importation laws are serious.<br /><br />Similar disclaimer to ozfreelancer - I am not a lawyer! I do have some contacts for Australian lawyers in this area so any Australians that need one, happy for you to PM me.

				u think thats scary? well i dont suggest coming to the USA, here we have mandatory minimums. A friend of a friend got charged with distribution of Heroin and got the minimum 5 years. However he only served 6 months, but is still on probation til january 2014. USA drug laws are the worst.

				great info thank you. something iv&#039;e been wondering for a while now.<br /><br />&quot;Penalties for trafficking of commercial quantities are a maximum term of 25 years prison or a fine of $400,000, or both.&quot;<br /><br />So for ordering say 2.5 g for the purpose of trafficking, that is what you could face?

				This is my opinion then with regard to this whole issue in Australia, the giant Alcatraz from hell and drugs. If you order them and they catch you, you&#039;re fucked. They will nail you for importing a border controlled substance, intent to distribute, using a carrier service in the proceeds of a criminal activity, probably tax evasion, money laundering (BTC wallets), personal possession, possess of a controlled substance with intent to distribute and trafficking in dangerous goods. To name a few. They would have laws so numerous they would nail you with that essentially you can kiss your arse goodbye. That&#039;s how I see it, always have! If you want a change join the Liberal Democratic PArty, it&#039;s free online and Australia&#039;s only true Libertarian Party. I suggest you look up their website www.ldp.org.au, go through it and if you agree witht heir principles, which you will, you&#039;ll join and vote LDP. I sure as shit did!

				this thread actually speaks to WHY silk road is so great.&nbsp; a few years ago there were a few hidden forums on the web that you could go to and there would be a few sources for certain items, but 80% were scams. And it was always dangerous dealing with people on those sites cuz it could very easily have been Law Enforcement. <br /><br />with Silk Road, and the blessed Tor network, they have provided about as much anonymity and safety from Law Enforcement and scammers as possible. which is why it has lasted so long and continues to grow and thrive. Its the right site at the right place at the right time. <br /><br />As an American who saw 2 states legalize marijuana recently, it seems the world is becoming sick of the War on Drugs and are progressively (slowly but still) seeming to become much more open to legalizing drugs. BUT until then, long live SR.

				Marketable quantities differ for each state, with TAZ as you&#039;ve mentioned being the most and considerably more generous/lenient towards quantity than the rest.<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m rehashing, but just to be clear. The graph you&#039;ve posted ( as below )&nbsp; is relevant to FEDERAL IMPORTATION LAW and not STATE POSSESSION LAW, for instance if you were to be busted with the drugs already in your possession the offense regarding quantity with relevance to severity of prosecution would vary from state to state and would likely be less severe as you will be charged under STATE POSSESSION LAW not&nbsp; FEDERAL IMPORTATION LAW, unless they can prove you imported them and charge you under federal of course.<br /><br />I remember the specific state per sate quantities and relating charges were posted here awhile ago, is there any chance you could dig them up and post them here, I expect they&#039;re located at the same site you acquired that info from as they were formatted in the same manner.<br /><br />Also here&#039;s some great info on dealing with police, I&#039;m sure it maintains a reasonable degree of relevance to other states as well.

				The Victorian Office of Public Prosecutions has this to say about maximum penalties:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Maximum penalties are rare<br /><br />It is very rare for maximum penalties to be given in sentencing. Maximum penalties are legislated by the parliament and used by the courts as a reference point when sentencing. This means that judges can impose a sentence that is up to but not exceeding the maximum penalty and is consistent with other sentences previously given in similar cases.<br /><br />In sentencing, the judge will take into account the impact of the crime on the victim. The Victim Impact Statement is one way they can do this. Other factors that will be taken into account include:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the nature and seriousness of the crime<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the circumstances of the offender (age, background, prospects for rehabilitation)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the offender’s past criminal history<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; whether the offender pleaded guilty<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the need to deter the convicted offender from committing further crimes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the need to deter others from committing similar crimes.<br /><br />The judge will usually impose a maximum sentence and a minimum sentence. If there is more than one offence the maximum sentence is called the total effective sentence. The minimum sentence is called the non-parole period, which is the time served before the offender is eligible for parole. Any sentence will take into account time already served. This is known as pre-sentence detention.<br /><br />An accused person may appeal against the severity of their sentence.<br /><br />For more information about sentencing, visit the Sentencing Advisory Council at www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will be attending the hearing of a Melbourne man caught importing via Silk Road on 30 January, so we should get a &#039;real life&#039; indication of sentences then.&nbsp; He entered a plea of guilty to all 10 charges in the Melbourne Magistrates court today and that early plea will be taken into account when he is being sentenced.

				We had an ex prisnor/drug dealer come to our school who was selling like a gazillion e pills a week or whatever and when he was in court he said the judge said something about how high the purity was of his pills and how that might of gave him a slightly longer sentence..? Who knows, anyway, I&#039;m just saying that they might mention the purity of the pills powder your importing/moving.
