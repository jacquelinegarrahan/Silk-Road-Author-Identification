				germans) <br /><br />I just come back. It is even better then before. Better weed for a cheaper price. <br /><br />It will be available only today. They didn&#039;t know the next time they will be open to strangers. So if you&#039;re not too far from Maastricht, enjoy&nbsp; :)

				i don&#039;t see any indication of this being a one day thing or reverting to the restriction of dutch/german/belgian residents only but i can&#039;t read dutch so might not be getting the full picture. it all seems a bit uncertain but great news still! i hadn&#039;t even heard about the court ruling :D wietpass needs to gtfo now they&#039;re just grasping at straws<br /><br /><br />&quot;Thirteen coffeeshops in the southern Dutch city of Maastricht had previously announced that they would once again open their doors for non-Dutch citizens starting May 5th (Dutch Liberation Day). The coffeeshops have a court ruling in their favor, though they have faced opposition from the municipality leading to this day. Before the weed pass legislation, Maastricht was a popular place for Belgians, Germans and French marijuana smokers to buy their wares.<br /><br /><br />Coffeeshops and the law versus the city<br /><br />Last week, the court in Maastricht ruled that the city’s mayor (Onno Hoes) did not have due cause when he closed the coffeeshop Easy Going last year. The mayor should have demonstrated that less expansive measures would come short in tackling drug-related crime.<br /><br />The city’s coffeeshops saw this verdict as justification to open their doors to everyone on May 5th. The municipality immediately sent out warnings, stating that coffeeshops who would indeed sell marijuana to foreigners would face charges. They would not share how the enforcement would take place. A spokesperson of the municipality stated that all their methods would “remain secret”.<br /><br />With Liberation Day coming to an end, the coffeeshops have seen a massive increase in customers (Many from Belgium) and the municipality or law enforcement have not responded in any way. In the meantime, the otherwise prominent street dealers have disappeared from the scene.<br /><br />The city’s mayor is currently taking a week-long holiday and it is not unthinkable that measures will still be taken against the coffeeshops. All we know is that it will be an uphill battle for the mayor, who will first need to find a basis for his views; whereas the coffeeshops have the court ruling, most of the citizens and police observations on their side.&quot;
