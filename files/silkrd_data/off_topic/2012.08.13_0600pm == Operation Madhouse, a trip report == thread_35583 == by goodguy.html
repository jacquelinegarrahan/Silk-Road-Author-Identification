				Operation: Madhouse. <br /><br />A changa trip report&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duration 30mins<br /><br />The Plan: to keep my eyes open while smoking all my remaining changa in one go and see how crazy I could get the OEV&#039;s<br /><br />5:00pm I rolled out 4 joints of changa each with a filter each containing 1 hits worth of dmt, I prepared the room opened the window closed the curtains and sat on my bed.<br /><br />5:30pm I began lighting the first joint and held each breath for 15-30 seconds I began to feel a slight&nbsp; buzz and there was ringing in my ears, then I got comfortable<br /><br />5:35pm I then smoked the second in a similar fashion no change had occoured I felt as if it had not worked at all, then I hit the third joint, half way through this joint the entire room and everything in it morphed based on there colour and orientation I tried to focus on getting all 4 smoked in rapid succession but it was hard, I was seeing all sorts of faces and movement shadows chasing toward me from under things and constant movement of the walls and ceiling this was exactly what I wanted intricate fish patterns in the ceiling colours and Mayan text everywhere and a large elf like face in the curtains<br /><br />5:45pm I was Â¾ of the way through my 4th and last joint it was so hard to focus and keep my eyes open my vision was heavily distorted and I found the colour and intricity of the smoke beautiful as it was a grey and light blue perfectly mixed before finishing this joint a began to lay back into my bed and was overcome with sudden fear, but I really wanted to see how mad this could get<br /><br />5:50pm I finished the last of the 4th joint and then as soon as I put down the filter left in the paper and the last of the smoke went out it stopped, asif it had never even happened and I felt really sad asif I had failed myself in trying to get as much in me as possible I had missed paying attention to what was happening around me.<br /><br />6:00pm pupils are completely back to normal and motor control is as it was before the trip, in hindsight it got very crazy like I wanted but I had missed out on paying attention to the most crazy parts and I was most defiantly not prepared for the sudden ending.<br /><br />EDIT: forgot to add if i touched anything red i was in immense pain O.o
