In the late 70&#039;s to mid 90&#039;s i ate a tremendous amount of L. Most was clean, with positive vibe and energy, there were the occasional dark, murky trips and clenching muscle aches. i didn&#039;t eat any trip after the summer of 95. Last summer i&nbsp; decided i was ready and had been hearing about some super clean white on white. Let me tell you this L was as good as any L i have ever ingested. Clean as could be, you could sleep on it if you wanted to. So as i said L is L. Let me say this about dosage, back in the latter part of the Dead days i&nbsp; believe that the average dose had been reduced to around 35 to 50 mics. They couldn&#039;t have people flipping out all over the place it would have been too much bad attention, if a blotter is 100 mic you do not need 3 or more to get where you need to be. Sorry but 100-200 mics of LSD-25 (or one of it&#039;s close cousins) is all you need. So any time i see some vendor, or somebody say it takes 3-5 hits, imo it is either not L or very, very weak/old. Happy Trails

				NBOME suck...they have a Lethal dose that is way less than LSD which is pretty much non existent.&nbsp; Not to mention people are going into seizures and dieing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done the NBOME...it was cool....LSD is better...and quite frankly....DMT is the best....15 min FULL breakthrough tripping, back to reality with 0 comedown effects....what more could you want?

				well nowadays it seems like you&#039;re more likely to get an NBOMe on street blotters than actual LSD, unlike back in the days when L was everywhere. That&#039;s mostly the difference between now and then. Still I&#039;ve had great times with nbome.
