				Coming down now after tripping fucking hard on some mushroom chocolate, I was just curious:<br /><br />Do you all prefer to trip by yourselves, trip with a friend, or trip with a sitter(someone sober to talk to)?<br /><br />I tripped with a friend once before and I think I prefer to be alone. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts and stories if you have any. :)

				i have to trip with at least one friend. they&#039;ve got to be on it as well, sober people scare me. i&#039;ve only tripped alone once and it was one of the worst experiences of my life, it put me off psychs for a long time

				I&#039;ve done all of them, actually coming off of LSD right now.<br /><br />I would say when it comes to the come down, either by yourself or possible with someone you love and tripped with would be best.<br /><br />I think I usually find myself alone towards the very end of my trips, even if I was tripping with friends earlier.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just the silence is peaceful<br /><br />Edit: Tripping by yourself is very more introspective, albeit probably not has much fum.<br /><br />Since you did it this time I would suggest tripping with others next time, can be really enjoyable.&nbsp; Try even going to a club, that can be really fun<br />

				Depends on a drug and what I want from experience, but in most cases I like tripping with close friends. Trips alone usually ends up a bit dark for me, and I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable tripping with a sober person (or be sober with a tripping person). :)

				Tripping by yourself is the only way to make sense of what the trip is about since everything is just your thoughts. Even material things. EVERYTHING.<br /><br />So when a person is there, it distracts you. Tripping with other people tripping is fun but it&#039;s no &quot;deep&quot; trip if you didn&#039;t take 3 Strong tabs. Got to take more so you for sure trip balls haha. Gotta love being a deadhead LOL<br />

				I find that people only irritate me while tripping, and overall distract from the experience. I discover so much more about myself when alone within the confines of my own home. Not to mention it&#039;s a bit more comforting to be able to let yourself go with the trip without worrying about others opinions.<br /><br />Tripping while talking with online friends can be pretty damn fun though, as I like to describe the crazy antics I get into while playing Skyrim on psychedelics. :P

				I would definitely not want to trip with a sitter on shrooms. On LSD I could, but on shrooms I get really paranoid about anyone whose not tripping, even if they are if I didn&#039;t actually see them take them I&#039;ll sometimes get paranoid about that person. My shroom trips have 3 general phases that can all come within a minute of each other - Distrust/Paranoia, Uncontrollable laughter that makes it hard to breathe, and Toddler talk where I&#039;m trying to explain something quite serious but it comes out of my mouth as, &quot;You juphtr cows the and with sssty porch see?&quot; Or I&#039;m talking but I&#039;m talking so quiet no one can hear me and I think they&#039;re ignoring me, which then sets off the paranoia again.

				Im really down for any. Ive done acid and shrooms by myself, with other people tripping as well and at parties and stuff where there are sober people everywhere (so not really sitters..). I might feel a little uncomfortable if they were absolute strangers or distant friends of friends of friends sort of thing.<br /><br />other peoples thoughts really dont bother me and I just enjoy it. on a side note, on shrooms I seriously have trouble putting a sentence together for like the first 30 minutes after it kicks in every time so if im with people ill usually just be sitting down somewhere watching the couch breathe or something.

				I don&#039;t mind either way. My preference is obviously to go through the experience with others, but I have been under the influence alone several times. I generally do it to test the product, if I have a good amount of it, before I share it with others. There are some drugs though, which I find to be somewhat wasteful to trip alone with, because I feel like I&#039;m not getting the most out of it. MDMA would be a good example of that.

				On acid, I always wonder how amazing it would be to share this experience with others but it really HAS to be the right people.&nbsp; A lot of your friends probably have personality traits that annoy you, and personally when I am tripping I realize that im only ACTUALLY close with 1-2 people (no matter what my FB friends list tries to tell me).&nbsp; I have never even seen another person while tripping (I trip in secluded areas/at night) but would absolutely love to share the experience with a VERY few select people.

				Sober people are definitely a no-no for me while tripping.&nbsp; On the flip side, though, I LOVE being sober (or at least not tripping) around people who are tripping.&nbsp; That is fucking fun.<br /><br />I do enjoy tripping alone, but tripping with friends is great, too.&nbsp; But they have to be really close friends, the kind you can share a long stretch of silence with without it becoming awkward.&nbsp; Because that IS going to happen if you&#039;ve eaten a decent amount!<br /><br />I used to love tripping at concerts.&nbsp; The first several times I tripped, that was what I did, and I felt strangely comfortable and at ease.&nbsp; The more the novelty wore off, though, the more I started worrying about the people around me.&nbsp; So, I don&#039;t really think I could enjoy that anymore.&nbsp; If I were going to trip nowadays, it would be in a very small group of 2-4 people in a safe space, or alone.

				I always trip with friends.&nbsp; I have tripped on LSD alone before and it is a little more introspective.&nbsp; I also didn&#039;t like interacting with my non tripping roommates and stayed in my room most of the time. Although they did almost convince me to go out to the bar, that would have been a little crazy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also tripped in a group on mushrooms I had a blast with friends, it was 4 close friends and we were on a isolated farm.&nbsp; I remember laying on a raft in the pool and I started realizing the shrooms were kicking in when I thought I was a frog on a lilly pad on a pond.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had a better trip than that time with 4 close friends.

				Initially I couldn&#039;t stand tripping around sober people, especially the doting type, but after a while it didn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken high doses of shrooms for instance at parties (once at a beer pong tournament!) and it&#039;s been fine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also gone to work on lower doses of psychs... <br /><br />But yeah, the bulk of my tripping has been done alone.&nbsp; Nothing better than turning off all the lights, grabbing a snorkel and heading to the bathtub to chill underwater for an hour while tripping hard.&nbsp; But it&#039;s this kind of weird stuff that I wouldn&#039;t really feel as comfortable doing with other people present.<br /><br />Tripping at night is nice for this same reason.&nbsp; Walking around at 4 AM when the city streets have emptied out and staring up at huge skyscrapers in perfect silence is totally sublime.

				I only recently got into shrooms, and each weekend I was working my way up on the dosages.&nbsp; First time I took 2.5g, the second time 3.5g, and the third time 5g.<br />I was tripping indoors, by myself, somewhat late at night.&nbsp; I remember turning on a show and getting freaked out by their morphing faces.&nbsp; I remember going into the bathroom and hardly being able to breathe, and I was for sure at that moment I was gonna die for some reason.&nbsp; I washed my face off with some cold water, told myself it was just a bad trip and I could ride it out.&nbsp; It was scary and fun at the same time.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;m more familiar with psychedelics, I think I wouldn&#039;t mind tripping alone, but I prefer tripping with friends.&nbsp; Meandering&nbsp; through a forest and laughing maniacally isn&#039;t that much fun when you&#039;re by yourself.&nbsp; But I also hate having a trip sitter.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather everyone around me be on my level.

				I really enjoy psychedelics solo, I have had some really great insights and life changing revelations by myself, but on the other hand I have had those occur with real close friends as well, I do prefer solo, but enjoy both, but I never did have a good time when someone outside of that psychedelic realm was around..&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I went to a little head shop about 6 years ago and bought 5 bags of cubensis mushrooms, about 175grams each if i remember coreectly. about 4-6 mushrooms in the bag. quality stuff. had fasted all day long and went home and sliced them all up on a little plate and ate all of them after cleaning the whole flat, absolutely spotless, like a ritual i do every time i trip alone.<br /><br />well holy shit. i had thee most intense trip ever. i went to bed and meditated until the stuff kicked in having resolved to myself not to move a muscle or open my eyes and i fell into this deep trance like state. it&#039;s not really possible to describe accurately what happened...... every molecule of my body was a separate universe that held memories and emotions of the past and present and i could &quot;warp&quot; to each of these zones by will. i could see them laid out in front of me like a huge chemical structure like a tree, like a nervous system. there was complete clarity and control over emotion and feelings, i was just a blank canvass experiencing the trip. it was not lost like an acid overdose, which i&#039;ve done before one or twice.<br /><br />at one point i had went to the &quot;world of the dead&quot; (this name and place stuck with me big time all throughout the trip). a shadowy figure with a silvery outline (cheesy i know) came and took me to this place. i met and spoke somehow with my granny, a friend who passed on, my cousin also passed.... even my old dog was there. later on in this world i was worried how to get back to the real world and my dead friend started singing &quot;back to life, back to reality&quot; and i started singing along, bopping my head and feet.... and slowly but surely reality came rushing over me and i was in the bed sweating like a gay priest in a puddle of sweat on the sheets singing out loud like a madman.<br /><br />i got up and went into the shower where i kept forgetting where the water was coming from and kept turning around like a dog chasing it&#039;s tail. after that i went into the living room and turned the telly on. a casualty halloween special was on and fuck me that shit was the most intense thing i have ever watched in my life....... antiques roadshow was on afterwards and jesus h muthafuckin christ i nearly died laughing at the shit that was going down on that. i couldn&#039;t breath. if anyone else in the building could hear me they would have thought i was having a breakdown.<br /><br />brilliant night. but haven&#039;t done such a dose again and don&#039;t believe i will. i&#039;m getting older and i like little nips of 10 liberty caps every so often through the night to give me a buzz to a milder trip. except another halloween where i took about 100 of the wee things and couldn&#039;t speak properly because i just bust out laughing in everybody&#039;s faces. they must have thought i was so rude! :)<br /><br />i love mushrooms &lt;3 :-*<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know why anyone would want to. Maybe exploring each others bodies would be fun on shrooms, but full out sex? No thanks, bad idea for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I&#039;m pretty flacid on shrooms, maybe that&#039;s just me, and quite the opposite when not on shrooms.<br />2. I don&#039;t like any physical exertion at all on shrooms.<br />3. Farting on shrooms is pretty common, and almost expected. God forbid one of us has a real &#039;shitty&#039; trip.<br />4. My attention span on shrooms is that of a toddler, probably a big turn off for her when I completely stop to examine a collection of freckles on her arm or a piece of fuzz on the bed.<br />5. I piss a lot on shrooms, well I often don&#039;t actually piss or very little but I often feel like I need to, maybe that&#039;s just me as well.<br />6. Laughing. I can only imagine how many times I would break out into an uncontrollable laughter.

				Okay another question..<br /><br />Is it possible to control what kind of trip you have, or to focus on something specific during a trip? My last trip left me feeling incomplete, I feel like I was allowed into a state of mind that I was desperately unprepared for, and I have this almost constant craving to try mushrooms again so I can get back into that state and correct what I have damaged. It has been almost a week since I tripped, and I have been suffering from severe depersonalization and derealization every day, I feel like I won&#039;t ever be normal again unless I can try to get back to that level of being and correct myself from the inside.

				^ Sounds to me like an isolation tank would do you a lot of good, I&#039;ve been thinking maybe you could simulate the experience with a bathtub, gonna try it soon<br /><br />As for the sex thing, I&#039;ve yet to find any drug where it interests me at all.

I was so turned on.. I just had to try it all! I started by kissing her all over and almost instantly it seemed like we were in a 69 hehe.. it was awesome.. it felt like i was one with her and visions in my head were of that concept of being one.. i am not sure how long we were in that position for but it was like a lifetime.. i ended up cumming once but unaware and my hard on stayed.. we ended up fucking most of the night and it seemed like an eternity but while having sex All i could envision was the creation of the universe and the big bang (No pun intended).. well after that it was morning and we both crashed and slept in a very messy bed haha.. she said she never had such amazing sex and seen a guy cum so much lol.. I ended up letting her know I was on acid and her reply was next time u drop call me haha..&nbsp; we are pretty close friends and have never slept together since but sex and psychedelics is amazing.. masturbation is pretty good too.. I have had great sex on shrooms but that one time on acid was the best.. I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND.. hope that answers yiur question Priscilla :).. Ill tell the shroom story another time..<br />&nbsp;

				When I was a teenager doing drugs (weed/acid/shrooms/X) was largely a positive experience&nbsp; fostering self-awareness and creating some very memorable social bonds and friends. Those experiences definitely enriched my life and created some great memories. This was during the Chicago House scene in the 80&#039;s. Lot&#039;s of dancing and fun. Good times.<br /><br />Having become an adult you are expected to conform and so I stopped doing psychedelics (one of my biggest regrets in life)<br />and tried to adapt to a shitty job and an unhappy marriage&nbsp; &nbsp;using coke and heroin forget and numb the pain. Of course, doing this isn&#039;t &#039;cool&#039; or &#039;romantic&#039; or socially acceptable anymore so you start doing them alone.<br /><br />Eventually, these solitary weekend activities eventually became daily rituals which my wife and employer found out about. Lost my job and ended up getting divorced. Divorce hurt like a motherfucker: but now I can do all the drugs I want whenever I want which is awesome.<br /><br />Sure: it be great to meet a single drug friendly woman who wasn&#039;t a total junky.. someone to share and experiment more positive life affirming psychedelic drugs with. Unfortunately, there&nbsp; aren&#039;t&nbsp; any dating sites for &quot;responsible drug users&quot;.. and nobody wants to risk getting involved with a junky. Having been one myself for a few years I can&#039;t say I blame them.<br /><br />It&#039;s sad: but as drug users we are forced into isolation b/c of the stigma associated with doing drugs. Consequently, most of the remaining drug users turn out to be total scheming bottom feeders. In all my years of doing drugs I have found that there is nothing more depressing than waiting in a roomful of junkies/coke heads for the dealer, or being around them when they are shooting up.I don&#039;t want nothing to do with that kind of scene so just give me my fucking dope and I am out of there.I prefer to fix alone. <br /><br />Sad but true. Consequently, in my solitude I often take great comfort in reading Nietzsche&#039;s &#039; Thus Spoke Zarathustra&#039; which is the loner&#039;s Bible par excellence and I highly recommend to drug fiends everywhere. :)<br /><br />**SILKROAD:Membership has it&#039;s privileges!&quot;**

I felt like I was a tree growing rapidly into the person I was with every time!; as if my orgasm became continuous like a plant or tree grows continuously, like the surges of growth became orgasms that never ceased, as if my very essence was/were? roots shooting into my partners only you could feel those roots sprouting into them as if they were the very soil trees grow in!<br /><br />You haven&#039;t tried Priscilla? <br /><br />{see my hand waving in the air Priscilla! Waving frantically to get noticed by you!!!}<br /><br /><br />I would like to be the first (was I the first?) to offer to be your shroom guild for all things and of course that would include sex too! To me you have to 1. love sex! (and who doesn&#039;t?) 2. love the one your with! 3. Just follow my lead and when we both wake up it should all be over!<br /><br />but cerially&nbsp; &nbsp;???&nbsp; &nbsp; really? <br /><br />Why would you think it would be difficult? You just become one with everything around you don&#039;t you? That&#039;s one thing you could always count on with any psychedelic was becoming one with all that is around you and having sex with some one is becoming one with everything around you. They become your tree of life, you become that trees soil of life and you accept this beautiful growing thing ( no pun intended:)) inside of you and their magic is mixed with yours to become that joining with all things wonderful! Hence the tree sprouting its roots into the soil, you. You becoming 1 with the soil as you grow together ..&nbsp; ...&nbsp; .... you know what? I should PM you this maybe :)<br /><br /><br />You&#039;re pulling my leg, aren&#039;t you! Lol<br /><br />&nbsp; :)~ &gt;:)<br /><br />note: I went ahead - or is that behind - and read the responses you got Priscilla and they ranged from just sex stories to scary. I&#039;ve tripped on ounces of fresh shrooms before - many many times and each time I made sure sex was going to happen. Each time it was like being reborn! The very best of experiences! LSD same thing only more intense. I prefer natural stimulants like shrooms over acid for the simple fact that having sex is about as natural a thing 2 humans can do together! I&#039;m sure you could make it into a bad trip if you really wanted too, but it is awesome Priscilla! Again, I volunteer to be your guild. Its never a bad thing to have someone that&#039;s very experienced with psychedelics and I have taken everything hundreds of times so when you do trip an get into problems like you[re describing of any thing other than complete wholeness and harmony with everything., a guild can help you see what you are missing and miss what you are seeing Priscilla

				I like tripping with my really close friends (the more the better) who I&#039;ve been tripping with since we were teenagers, especially if it&#039;s mushrooms. Strangers and or non trippers seem to freak me out when I&#039;m tripping on mushrooms. Acid I can be around strangers if the dose isn&#039;t to high but better to be around close friends. The last few times I tripped I had to be listening to music during the peak or I would start to get freaked out. It&#039;s like when the music would stop things would get a little weird, but as longs as the music was playing everything was ok&nbsp; ;D

				Tripping with friends is fun, but you have to be constantly aware of them. It&#039;s another being with energy within them and sometimes you can never fully express or understand them except for those great moments while tripping when you both have complete clarity and all you have to do is smile at each other and you just know. <br /><br />But, other times I just want to feel myself and my personal universe and explore it. My favourite things before psychedelics was breaking myself down and reconstructing it to see what made me the way I am. Introspection is just one of the most enjoyable past times for me. And I especially want to be alone when things go wrong, because those moments are important if not the most important to realize. A friend is a distraction trying to comfort you and move you away from that. But alone you have to face directly whatever it is that set it off, which usually comes down to something from your childhood that you had no control over. <br /><br />So yeah, tripping alone ftw&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;m happy to trip alone or with friends, but I only take the more spiritually powerful (for me) chemicals (ie LSD, psilocybin, DMT) alone or with certain close friends with whom I can be confident the trip will be good. Anything that feels like more of a candy psychedelic is more fun to enjoy around just anyone at all so long as you can pretend you&#039;re just odd.<br /><br />Once walked around an outdoor mall on my third day straight of something that was supposed to be 2c-i (friend judged by experience that it wasn&#039;t, so I don&#039;t know if it was or wasn&#039;t). To put it nicely, I let the universe judge my first dose then eyeballed them based on the first after that... it was intense.<br /><br />Alone, my senses overpowered me and they and my thoughts melted into each other (so that what I saw translated into smell, and my thoughts became images that I might see with my eyes (on a heavy hallucinogenic), and everything I heard became my thoughts, etc.)<br /><br />Then I stood up and walked a mile and a half down to the mall. Everything was so very pretty, and melty, and colorful, and I was just euphoric and smiley as fuck. Had no trouble keeping up normal conversation when I encountered a friend arbitrarily.<br /><br />What I&#039;m saying is, know the personalities of the psychedelics you&#039;re interested in taking, and interpret therefrom what environments may positively influence each. There&#039;s a psychedelic for every situation if you look hard enough (and every different situation leads to a very different experience and different things to learn if you enjoy perceiving psychedelics as guiding entities).
