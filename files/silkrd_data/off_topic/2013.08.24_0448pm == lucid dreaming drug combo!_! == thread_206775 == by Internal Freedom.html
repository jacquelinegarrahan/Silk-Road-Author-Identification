				So I&#039;m one of those people who dreams vividly every single night. However, lucid dreams are extremely uncommon for me. Ive maybe had 2-3 in my entire life. I usually take Melatonin to help me sleep, and stumbled upon an interesting drug combo with some awesome effects.<br /><br />I was pre-loading one week with Piracetam and I was noticing my dreams were becoming a lot longer and I could remember them better in the morning when taking it during the day. Then one evening I took a 1g capsule of Piracetam with my usual 1.5mg of Melatonin before bed. I had a lucid dream that night where I was in a gunfight on an island. I could control every aspect of the dream and was even aware I was sleeping at the time, it was an awesome experience.<br /><br />I started to think what I did differently that night and I remembered I had taken the Piracetam before bed. I did the same combo again the next night and had ANOTHER lucid dream. Ive tried this combo multiple times since and determined (for my body atleast) that the combo forces me to dream like that. Wondering if anyone else has tried this or similar combos with anything to report?

				Melatonin is probably the best-known LD inducer. Unfortunately it&#039;s prescription only in Germany (pharmy lobbying is pretty rampant here). Gotta give piracetam a try, thanks for the suggestion :)<br />I&#039;ve recently done much experimentation with phenibut and I have LDs roughly 40-60% of the time when I take a large dose (1-2g) before sleep. At least that&#039;s the ones I remember, the actual rate could be much higher because my dream recall is kinda shitty at the moment.

				african dream root is supposed to be excellent for this purpose, though i haven&#039;t tried it. dream herb seems to work pretty well. i also highly suggest keeping a dream journal. reading your dreams will help you become aware when you&#039;re dreaming.

				Ive tried mexican dream herb. It was the single most foul thing ive ever tasted in my entire life. Worse then any chemical or food, it was so fucking bitter. Smoking it wasnt too bad but I didnt really get any effects from it that way. I barely got effects from the tea, I tried gel-capping some too and that didnt seem to do much either.<br /><br />So far Melatonin has been the best for dreaming :) Piracetam is just a new discovery I found to also work by fluke

				I&#039;m not sure what the strict definition of lucid dreaming is, but if you mean being aware that you&#039;re dreaming and being able to &#039;steer&#039; your dream, most of my dreams are like that to varying degrees.&nbsp; Every once-and-a-while I&#039;ll be in a dream where I think it&#039;s real and not a dream, but most of the time I know I&#039;m dreaming, and the rest of the time I just wake up as the fragments of the memory of the dream are breaking up and being forgotten so I can&#039;t really remember what degree of lucidity they had at the time.

				When I was in in-patient rehab, loads of people were prescribed melatonin and most of them complained of vivid, lucid dreams. I can&#039;t vouch for or against however because I&#039;ve never taken it, but it seems to be the place to start.

				Im an AVID Lucid Dreamer. And when I like to I take about 10mg of Melatonin, try that and here are some tricks.<br /><br /><br />1. Throughout the entire day numerous times keep pinching your skin, Your dreams are made up of a recollection of your thoughts/memories etc. So if you have an entire day of pinching yourself you will likely dream about it. And in a dream you cannot feel pain. So you go to pinch yourself, you feel no pain, and then you realize you are lucid dreaming and can control your dreams.<br /><br />2. Time. In dream time is weird. Clocks, alarm clocks etc. Same with lights and light switches. Try in your dream to see a clock or flick a light switch on and it won&#039;t work and you can realize you are dreaming.<br /><br />3. This is more if you are actually able to lucid dream <br /><br />a. If you are able to lucid dream and want to manifest someone in your dream simply go up to someone and ask, &quot;Have you seen *xxx Celebritiy* they will then show up in your dream.<br /><br /><br />Also I have found that a 20mg+ dosage of Oxycodone or similair opioids will put me in a similair state of being able to rest and dream like the same as melatonin.<br /><br />I have one single instance where I took half of a 30mg oxycotin and relaxed my ENTIRE body to the point where my brain thought I was sleeping as NO muscles etc. were moving, I simply started thinking about a dream and instantly started floating above my body into a lucid state where I could control my dream.<br /><br />And there is a rant from someone who is 32 and has lucid dreamed since he was 8 years old when I learned to control my dreams to combat monsters and have been able to pull bazookas out of my pocket.

				My favorite reality check is holding your nose closed, then trying to breathe through it. It&#039;s impossible to physically block your breathing in a dream because your dream breathing is linked with your physical breathing. This also makes breathing under water possible.<br />Not just clocks and switches, but all kinds of technical things may work unreliably.<br /><br />A good manifestation technique for beginners is the door technique. Go to a door and visualize the object of your desire behind it. Don&#039;t just think it&#039;s there, KNOW it&#039;s there and it will appear when you open the door. Once you&#039;ve mastered this technique, you can start trying to manifest things in plain sight :)

				Its very hard for me to lucid dream naturally. Now that Ive cut out my nightly melatonin intake, Ive barely been dreaming at all. If I do dream, I don&#039;t remember it.<br /><br />But on the plus side, Ive been feeling EXTREMELY well rested every day and Ive been sleeping 8 hours instead of 12 and still feeling completely energized. I think it was actually a good thing I stopped taking it, after all I was on it for over 3 months.<br /><br />However if I do find myself in another dream, I will try some of those tricks including the pinching &amp; breathing one. They do sound interesting, thanks 8)
