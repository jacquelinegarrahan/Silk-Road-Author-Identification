				I&#039;m calling Shenanigans! What is shenanigans you might ask? Well classicly it is a term used when One thinks a carnival game or other attraction is rigged or generally not fair at all.<br />Thus the call to Shenanigans on this site. First let me say Yes I love it however i Would love it, and spend ALOT more if the prices were you know Reasonable. I&#039;ve heard a couple B.S excuses but I&#039;m about to refute them if you feel diffrently then please chime in. Debate is what makes all things come to light and thus better. <br /><br />1. Any 17 year old can get roxi&#039;s for 20 dollars on the street let alone someone who is purchasing an entire script which usually works out to be around 5-10 dollars a pill MAX <br />So lets say all the vendors here are incompetent 17 year olds, even selling at MAX VALUE (30) they would be makeing over&nbsp; 1200 dollars <br />But no the incompetent 17 year old wants to squeeze every penny he can and thus heart a GREAT website <br /><br />This is what Silk Road SHOULD, and WIll eventually become A Free Market, The market will determine the prices as more and more people figure out hey I can just score some drugs on the street for cheap and make a QUCIK killing selling at MAX street price the SR price will have to go down to MAX street price. <br />After this happens the big boys will step in and see the ability to make big money fast but most of all SAFELY, Dont think for a minute that this is somehow more dangerous than street dealing. We are VERY lucky to sell this way.<br /><br />Which brings me up to my next point, We have thousands of users from ALL OVER THE WORLD that means our connections therefore move from our local neighborhood and perhaps even a town over to, the ENTIRE WORLD&#039;s Neighborhoods and backyards. <br />This means that People should be Selling CHEAPER than street price CHEAPER <br />It makes perfect sense why is amazon able to sell so much cheaper than a brick and mortar store? Because they can source from anywhere in the world.<br />Shit EVERYTHING you buy on the internet is cheaper because there is more competition, and access.<br /><br />So with that being said lets hear some possible ideas/excuses of why shit here is so OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced <br />

				I respectfully disagree, Roxies on the street have almost doubled in the price over the past year $15 upwards to $20-$25 and $30 <br />for me I buy mostly Beans (From Holland) And pay significantly less here than I would on the street, Where you can&#039;t even get real MDMA the other thing I buy here is Xanax on the street Bars run most $5 sometimes less. Here I can get bars less than $5 most of the time in the $3 range. So what is so over priced? This is a free market and free markets regulate themselves if someone doesn&#039;t like the price then don&#039;t buy it and it enough people don&#039;t buy it, The seller will lower the price. Also this is not Amazon this is site where people can buy/sell and trade Illegal Narcotics of all kinds so obviously there is going to be a premium.

				It all depends on what you are in the market for it seems. The kind of shit I&#039;m interested in is sold on here very cheap.

				I pretty much only buy opiates here.&nbsp; I do feel that almost all of them are over priced.&nbsp; But...<br /><br />1. I cant source any locally <br /><br />2. The selection here is amazing<br /><br />So the reason why I pay the expensive prices is because I cant get them anywhere else and often the quality is better.&nbsp; It sure would be far more convenient to acquire them immediately and not have to pay the premium but for me, its not an option.

				If you can get bulk opiates at a much better price.. and you may well be able to.. the question stands, why don&#039;t you start selling here under market value? You&#039;re bound to make an absolute killing if you can beat the market price, and probably even if you cant

				SR is a free market, that is sellers are free to sell their goods at a price determined by them. Buyers are free to buy from any seller at their listed price, they may choose to do business with any number of sellers based on their own choices. The street is not a free market, you do not have chouce between sellers without significant travel between these sellers, you do not have information on the price, quantity or quality of their product before you get there, if you decide not to do business then you ate out your travel tome and costs.<br /><br />Prices on SR will fall only when new sellers come to the market to compete with the established vendors. However the new vendors are attracted by the high profit margins available at current prices so will not be in a rush to lower them significantly and usuall only do so as introductory offers.<br /><br />SR works just fine as it is, the premium prices reflect product quality and ease of access.

They were $7 and $12 bucks a pop. The good ole days. <br /><br />Put yourself in their shoes. If you were selling roxy 30&#039;s on here and charging 40 dollars a piece and you ran out of product with in an hour every time you listed it, would you lower your prices? <br /><br />I felt the same way as you but quickly got over it. I look for good deals that I can&#039;t get in my area on a lot of different items. You might find a good deal on some coke this week and a good deal on some roxies next week. A little variety is good. Let the addicts pay those big prices. They are all wrapped up in one thing when there&#039;s lots of great stuff on SR. They are missing out because all they concentrate on is that one drug of choice. I&#039;m glad I enjoy different drugs because it makes SR more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you want to see some high prices go look at the prices on heroin or blotter acid. As far as coke goes, the prices reflect the amount of vendors there are. There&#039;s only a handful of USA vendors. Some people would rather pay a little more then to have to play the street game. They can get their shit delivered to their front door and nobody sees them hanging out with the wrong crowd or in the wrong part of town. That way word doesn&#039;t get out and your so called friends wont come over and never leave.<br /><br />The weed here is worth it to me. I can buy a 30 bag in my area and it last me 2 days or I can get a gram off SR and it last me a week. I think prices are pretty good. You get what you pay for as long as your smart about it.

				I think the original poster is also totally underestimating the convenience factor. Some of us can&#039;t go hang out in clubs or be seen in the wrong places. We may be well known or have a sick child to care for. The beauty of free enterprise is that if there are those of us who will pay for quality and convenience then the market will reflect that.<br /><br />That said, I would love to see the prices come down. But I always have the option of NOT BUYING if I don&#039;t like the price!

It&#039;s also convenient for the vendors.&nbsp; They have escrow and DCN&#039;s to protect there product <br />They also dont have to worry about their house being broken into by Junkies or getting mugged etc Not to mention HOW MUCH safer it is to actually sell drugs on here than on the streets. <br /><br />Let the debate continue, Why are the prices so high? Are they just that greedy? has no one been able to find a LEGIT source that can get more pills than a 17 year old? <br />Cheers!

				@rmaxjax<br />You don&#039;t seem to understand that SR is international, prices of drugs are very different depending your area. Your &quot;neighborhood drug dealer&quot; is not the same as my &quot;neighborhood drug dealer&quot;. There is no &quot;price model&quot; other that offer vs demand. <br /><br />As already said, if you think drugs are too expensive on SR, don&#039;t buy here, this is not even a debate...<br /><br />WL

				I have done a brief analysis of various substances (well the ones I use) Weed, hash, MDMA, and others (not prescription medicines though.) SR prices are approximately 25% to 50% of domestic prices in my country. Yes you read that right prices on SR are usually less than half the street price in my city. But the most important thing is the quality. SR product, if you are doing your research before buying, is usually miles ahead of the local street rubbish. If you think SR is expensive then I need to move to your city.

However as far as prescription drugs go (Oxycodone, xanex, Opana etc) Prices on here are roughly double that of the street. I guess you win some and lose some it just did not make sense to me how they can be so cheap in so many neighborhoods (not just mine)<br />&nbsp;but be twice the price on an international website with unlimited connections....
