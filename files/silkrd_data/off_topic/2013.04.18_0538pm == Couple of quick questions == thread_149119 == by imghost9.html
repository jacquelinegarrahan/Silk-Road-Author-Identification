				Hey guys, had a couple questions and figured I&#039;d put em all In 1 thread.<br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; SR Staff has just extended my resolution by 4 days. Once these 4 days are up (considering we haven&#039;t came to a resolution) will auto finalize go on my record, or will SR Staff step In again?<br /><br />2. I see blockchain Is down. Can anybody recommend some other wallets?<br /><br />3. I&#039;m In desperate need to place an order today, so It gets shipped by tommorow. I use dwolla and was wondering a quick way to purchase BC.&nbsp; I only have experience with BitInstant and after reading some reviews as of late, I&#039;m kinda sketched out.<br /><br />Thank you

Once an order is in resolution it will not auto-finalise. It will remain in resolution until the buyer and the vendor come to an agreement on how to proceed, or an administrator makes their decision on the resolution (which is final).<br /><br />2. If you want access to your Bitcoin at all times, use the original bitcoin-qt client which you download onto your own machine, routed through TOR, and with three strongly encrypted wallet backups; one on a USB stick, one in the cloud, and one attached to an email that you send to yourself. I would advise using a brain-wallet if you want the ultimate security solution.<br /><br />You can also use Multi-Bit or Electrum if you do not wish to download the entire blockchain. Again, ensure you back up your wallet and private keys.<br /><br />3. I cannot help you on this point as I have no experience using Dwolla or BitInstant.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				CampBX is an exchange that accepts Dwolla, but it can take a while to confirm.<br /><br />Multibit is probably the best client for you.<br /><br />You probably won&#039;t get it through today.
