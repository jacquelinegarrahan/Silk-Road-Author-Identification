				Been ordering from lots of different vendors ever since discovering this site. But still haven&#039;t found the right weed seller for me.<br /><br />So... does anyone want my business?<br /><br />I&#039;m a guaranteed 1/2oz - 1oz every two weeks if I fall in love with your product and price.<br /><br />I value quality. It must be really good weed. But I don&#039;t want to pay a testicle for it.<br /><br />Anywhere between 120-180 for a half or 200-250 for an ounce, depending on quality is okay with me.<br /><br />Actually saw a couple listings from ggw, puffbuddy, and norcalking that seems to fit the, but quantity is limited and they&#039;ll probably be sold out by thrusday when I&#039;m planning to order...<br /><br />Anyway, who wants a chance to make a regular out of me?

				Also, consistency is important to me. I want someone who will set me aside my half and/or ounce every two weeks since they know the order is coming.<br /><br />That&#039;s the only reason I haven&#039;t become a uber muskabuzz fanboy yet to be honest (as far as his halfs go, would like him to charge less for ounces)

				If you find one, please tell me. I&#039;m also interested in a solid vendor if they can beat my caregivers prices and quality. I&#039;m also a guaranteed 1/2oz - 1oz every two weeks if any vendors are interested. :)

				Haven&#039;t ordered from puffbuddy yet, but I&#039;ve been thinking about giving him a shot.<br /><br />i would rather buy one of his ounces but im not keen on finalizing early, so that&#039;s my excuse for overlooking him so far, even though his halfs are still in my price range.<br /><br />Gary I will definitely let you know if I find what I&#039;m looking for :)<br /><br />edit: apologies, i think was thinking about norcal420hookup with the FE OZ

				Ugh I feel your pain dude. I don&#039;t really want to pay $300+ an ounce for some top-shelf weed. I don&#039;t want to buy a damn quarter pound either.<br /><br />Balls. Just balls.

				I decided to go with CaliforniaBuddy.<br /><br />He&#039;s the only one who actually messaged me expressing an interest in vending to me.<br /><br />And I&#039;m really upset about the orders I had cancelled today so it&#039;s nice to know the dude&#039;s actually willing to sell to me...

				California buddy is one of my favorites. The bud I got was killer and about a gram overweight on an 1/8th.&nbsp; Arrived in 3 days with stealth packaging and no bullshit. Communication was excellent, weed was as good or better than advertised. You get what you pay for. I have found that paying full price will usually get you higher quality often with bonus weight versus looking for a discount which always turns out to be less than desirable.&nbsp; DON&#039;T GO OUTSIDE OF SILK ROAD ESCROW.&nbsp; YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY GET BURNED. YOU ARE BETTER OFF FINDING GOODS IN YOUR AREA.
