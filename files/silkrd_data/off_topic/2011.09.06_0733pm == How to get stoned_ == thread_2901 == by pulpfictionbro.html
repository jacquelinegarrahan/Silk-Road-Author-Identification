				So i have been smoking weed for about a month now but on one of those days i had some Pot cookies and they totally blew me away. My body was just paralyzed, my face felt like it had a million needles piercing it and the whole experience was just awesome. I have been unable to re-create that experience using my vaporizer, how do i get that high again? Do i need to smoke more? Vaporize at a higher temperature (i usually start @ 185 C and up 5 C every bag)?&nbsp; I have the Arizer Extreme Q by the way..

				that is a once in a life time event im afraid. that happened to me once and i spend years trying to recreate it. just wastes pot and builds tolerence. slow it down a bit&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />if you really, really wanted to get stoned,you could grab an 1/8th and head to saudi-arabia, bust out your bag and let them show you the real meaning of getting stoned lol :P

				well it looks like its time for more of spuds patented armchair biochem (as usual if im wrong someone with real knowledge please correct me). if memory serves correctly there is a difference between smoked and eaten cannabis, when smoked the active chemical is delta 9-THC, but when it is eaten its metabolised into 11-thc which is more psychedelically potent or so i read somewhere. so the key if you want to get super battered again may well be to make some hash oil brownies or even some of my own recipe &quot;Rez-Solution&quot; get some awesome quality hash, pop it into a small bottle of a strong spirit, vodka, whiskey whatever, warm the liquid inside by putting the bottle in a bath of boiling water or something and shake from time to time, i repeated this over the course of three days ending up with a murky looking drink that ripped my face off. you can also do this with green if you like, just grind it up fine and add it to the alcohol

				Yep, eating cannabis and smoking it can have very different effects. I live in a MMJ state and have easy access to great edibles. So this one time I decided to see just how baked I could get. I devoured like 3 strong medicated candy bars, several ounces of medicated hard candy, and a bunch of other hash foods all at once. I thought, &quot;whats the worst that could happen?&quot;. It was messed up. I was so high I was freaking out. My eyes were so dry it hurt to blink a little. It was almost terrifying. The effects lasted more than 12 hours. I love weed, smoke it everyday, but that was insane. I couldn&#039;t even sleep. Up all night. If someone told me they had dosed me with LSD I would have believed it.

				Also, smoking and vaporizing are a lot different. Combustion offers you the full cannabinoid profile, whereas vapes don&#039;t get hot enough. Though when you vape, you can save the vaped bud for edibles.

				I love to VAPORISE! Wow, I use to smoke joints but vaporising gets you absolutely RIPPED! <br /><br />It hits me like a ton of bricks but also gives me energy to socialise, but it&#039;s a clean high. FANTASTIC!

				vapes are great, but I can&#039;t commit to one - still need to burn a J sometimes,<br />the difference in the cannabinoid uptake is easily recognizable, both with advantages in my view.<br /><br />and as for the edibles the same thing - I love that all day body high I get from a nice space cake<br />(if you&#039;re ever in negril ask for them at the place with the red roof toward west end)

				Each type is a little bit of a different experience to me. Bong for relaxing, joints for relaxing and doing something, pipes for anytime relaxing, vaporizers for relaxing and being productive, and edibles for getting destroyed. You might be able to get just as stoned from packing bowl after bowl in any of those devices, but I usually lose focus because I&#039;m happy with my high. When you eat an edible you go all in.<br /><br />As profspudhed said, edibles will also react differently with your body than smoking will. Dosing edibles can be a bit tricky as you see 2x, 5x, 10x, 20x edibles and many work on different scales and definitely different quality. I&#039;ve found chocolates to give the heaviest high. Something with thc binding to fats/chocolates, definitely not my area of expertise. <br /><br />In my experience using a volcano vaporizer, it almost always gives a much lighter high. I don&#039;t get that &quot;couch lock&quot; feeling where I don&#039;t want to move anywhere. I can be active and productive and high as a kite. Epic quality bud through a vape will make me feel like I can still be active and productive, but I&#039;ll be higher than a kite and definitely can&#039;t perform as well. By far my favorite combination is an amazing sativa through a vape, but if you want a &quot;heavy stone&quot; munch on some edibles or smoke some hash oil.
