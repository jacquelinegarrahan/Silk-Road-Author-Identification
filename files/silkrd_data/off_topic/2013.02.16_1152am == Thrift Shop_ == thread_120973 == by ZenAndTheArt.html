				Firstly, Macklemore what do you think of him?<br />I first heard Thrift Shop a couple of weeks ago (in UK), really liked it, so I began to check out his previous work and was blown away by the sheer amount of quality stuff he&#039;s done, and the huge range and diversity of his song writing. All of which he&#039;s done completely unsigned! 8)<br /><br />Secondly, what do you think of the idea of thrift shopping and are consumer culture in general?

				Haven&#039;t heard much of his music besides &quot;thrift shop&quot; and &quot;same love&quot;<br /><br />Here in australia it&#039;s called op shopping &quot;from opportunity&quot;. Only done it a few times - looking for some funky clothing for parties or if we&#039;re doing a dress up paintball skirmish &gt;:|<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of reports financial vendors in the US knocking back people for loans based on where they shopped for their clothes (thrift shops etc) <br /><br />Some people like to shop in those sorts of places.

				I&#039;ve never been &quot;thrift&quot; shopping myself. In the UK our equivalent would be the charity shops like Oxfam and Sue Ryder, they can be an excellent place to get old or out of print books. I wonder if that Thrift Shop song were to become as popular as Gangnam Style if the charity shops would see a flood of young hipster, fashionista types coming through their doors?!<br /><br />I like hearing Macklemores attitude towards our consumer culture in his songs Thrift Shop and Wings. It&#039;s a breath of fresh air after years of hearing rappers going on about their expensive watches, clothes, cars, champagne, private jets (G6 G6 G6 &gt;:() and jewellery. You could argue it&#039;s escapism for the listener, I see it more as relentless product placement (have you seen the music vids now!) and promotion of the &#039;on-trend&#039;, through-away, one-upmanship of our current culture.<br /><br />I do like nice things too. I&#039;ll spend out on decent coats and maybe a good pair of shoes or sunglasses 8) every so often, and of course a good hair cut.<br />But (unlike a far few of my friends) I refuse to pay top dollar for jeans (£70+) or T-shirts (£35+) or underwear and socks. I&#039;m not into jewellery much or fashion labels.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				good song but it&#039;s so over played here ugggg.. On another note you can make some decent buy drugs for weekend money thrifting. My brother tries to go at least 3 times a week to all the goodwills in a 30miles range or so. Making a few hundred every 2 weeks or so buying shit. Kid bought a $5 gucci sweatshirt and sold it on ebay for 245 with 15 for shipping lol. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been a huge fan of his since before thrift shop came out. Here are some of his others that are even better:<br />Otherside: There&#039;s a remix version and the original. The original samples the red hot chili peppers song although it turns it into being about lean and oxy rather than heroin. The official remix changed up the beat slightly.<br /><br />Neon Cathedral: One of my favorite songs of all time. It&#039;s about alcohol addiction and other religions (Macklemore is sort of an odd one when it comes to religion &quot;atheist jesus piece&quot; is a reference he uses)<br /><br />Life is a Cinema: Song about overuse of drugs leading to looking at life as a movie and improving oneself<br /><br />Vispassana: Song about coming back from a drug overdose and living life to the fullest<br /><br />Can&#039;t Hold Us: Sorta just a really fast paced hype song with a really nice beat and lyrics<br /><br />And We Danced: Another fast, relatively light hearted song about a party<br /><br />Fake ID: Light hearted story about getting a fake ID as a kid<br /><br />Make the Money: About going where you want to go in life rather than doing what society/others expect of you<br /><br />Jimmy Iovine: In a similar sort of light as Make the Money, basically telling the record labels to go fuck themselves<br /><br />City Don&#039;t Sleep: Slower song about the social issues of homeless issues<br /><br />Soldiers: Song about how people get thrown in jail for stupid shit and it just makes them worse off in the future<br /><br />I tried to sort these somewhat by subject but I basically did it from memory about the lyrics so I may be off. He&#039;s really doing some amazing work now. To clarify so the community doesn&#039;t hate him, he isn&#039;t explicitly anti-drugs or anything like that. He used shrooms a lot when younger and attributes his style and finding himself to that but he also had a lot of issues with opiates and alcohol which has lead him to general sobriety now. <br /><br />If you only have time to listen to a few, I&#039;d listen to Otherside (the original), City Can&#039;t Hold Us, Neon Cathedral, and Vispassana, and Soldiers to give you a mix of his different speeds and what he&#039;s talking about (drugs to social issues).

				@Hee57 I really like &#039;Can&#039;t Hold Us&#039;, it&#039;s so catchy! I thought it sounded familiar when I first looked it up on YouTube, I&#039;ve since found out it&#039;s being used on a beer ad (Miller Light?). There are a few tracks which you&#039;ve mentioned which I haven&#039;t heard yet, I&#039;ll check them out. And anyone who liked &#039;Thrift Shop&#039; but hasn&#039;t seen the vid for &#039;And We Danced&#039; is in for a real treat!<br /><br />This all just shows what a wide and eclectic range of subjects he covers, and some subjects you won&#039;t have heard any other rappers broaching. I thought he was really brave to stand up for equality in marriage for gay couples, a subject that he has personal experience with (gay uncles) and could&#039;ve easily of had a negative impact on his career at that early stage, giving that hip hop is stereotypically such a homophobic community.<br /><br />Other subjects Macklemore has broached in his songs include; baseball, anti-fashion, the realities of drug abuse, being Irish and proud, atheism and religion, growing up in modern America, love, partying, the music industry, hip hop, and white privilege, to name a few.<br />There is an interesting track called &#039;White Privilege&#039; that is worth checking out, where he talks about being a white rapper in a music genre that has it&#039;s roots in the black community and their struggle for equality.

Thanks for the song. Relatively soon, I will be going to one of his performances and plan on having an amazing time. Might mix some mdma in to make it even better.
