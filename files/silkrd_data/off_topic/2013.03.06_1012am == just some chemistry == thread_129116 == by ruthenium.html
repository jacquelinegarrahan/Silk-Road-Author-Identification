Grind the pills to dust. 500 pills x 60mg = 30g pseudo ephedrine.<br />Next get a beaker and throw the grinded pills in, add ice cold distilled water to it, swirl a bit and filter, repeat until the water has no more bitter taste of the ephedrine to it.<br />Next add Methanol to the extracts, some white crap (methyl microcrystallinecellulose should come out) filter that and save the extracts, now evaporate slowly the solution using a fan or something.<br />when it evaporated scrape all the pseudofed together and throw it in a beaker again, rinse with ice cold anhydrous acetone and filter, now you have pretty pure pseudo ephedrine.HCl, should be around 28-30grams if you used 500 tablets of 60mg each.<br /><br />Prepare your push-pull set up, duct tape all the stoppers tight, and the hoses aswell to make sure there are NO leaks. Use one of this set ups:<br />http://wyxwerboi3awzy23.onion/src/1362586402888.png<br /><br />Okay now let&#039;s get into business..<br /><br />30g of pseudo ephedrine.HCl, 45g of elemental I2 and 21g of Red Phosphorus were added in the reaction flask, the reaction may start or may not start on it&#039;s own, make sure to shake it all good together so its mixed good. Personally I like to kick the reaction myself in so I add just enough water to make it a very damp tick mud, but not wet.<br />Once the reaction kicks in (patience my friends) it will liquify (reaction generates H2O), start thick mud, let it thin out it self.<br />Still if it doesn&#039;t start trying applying some heat not adding more water, excess water will kill your reaction.<br /><br />P.S: if using recycled Red phosphorus add a cap full of 35% H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide).<br /><br />Okay so the reaction started, it may be impossible to see the flask inside from all the HI gas, if you can&#039;t see the reactants swirl or shake until you can see what&#039;s happening, you are looking for a nice bubbling.<br />Thick smoke = bad - it means fire in your flask = bye-bye reaction.<br />Hard shaking will slow/stop the reaction allowing you to get control over it again. If the contents rise up too high and tend to blow out the flask, swirl it lightly to calm it down.<br /><br />------ALWAYS KEEP A WET TOWEL NEXT TO YOU-------<br /><br />Reaction too hot? never touch the phosphorus, it is like molotovcocktail and will stick to whatever and burn and barely stops burning, even with towel to avoid disaster, get the flask away and keep the wet towel over it.<br /><br />Phosphorous fire not confined to a flask<br />- Phosphorus is hell to extinguish once it catches fire. DON&#039;T TOUCH! Phosphorous will stick to whatever it contacts and burn.<br />- The amount of smoke is unfathomable, and will draw attention..<br />- Toss your wet towel over it, this will cut off&nbsp; its oxygen, and buy you time, maybe a minute. (don&#039;t worry, you will be moving at the speed of light,)<br />- Wet dirt is the best retardant, water may just blow it around if a lot of RP is on fire. But water will put it out if you flood it<br />- The worst thing to do is to run away, leaving it out of control, probably will result in a fire, injuries, and your arrest.<br />- Most fire extinguishers are not very effective against a phosphorous fire!<br /><br />Okay so back to the chemistry..<br /><br />Stage one:<br />The thick mixture liquifies and the bubbles should be small, you may notice some of the gas being pushed into the P/P device, the volume of the solution will increase. As time goes by HI gas to the P/P will decrease but the bubbling still continues, continue heat to maintain an easy bubbling reaction, heat only maintains the reaction going it does not create the bubbles.<br /><br />Good signs: White or light coloured fog/mist is fine.<br />BAD: thick yellow or red smoke overreaction, maybe phosphorus fire in the flask, shake and shake as explained before to get reaction under control.<br /><br />Stage two:<br /><br />Increase the heat slowly to 95C, the flask atmosphere changes to yellow/green/red, the small bubbles change into large holes like moon craters, the mixture becomes more turbulent losing the small bubbles, all the reactants will rise and at this point you should take the heat off and swirl to avoid explosion, large amounts of heat and gas are produced, keep swirling, the P/P will be pushing and bubbling big time, at the final stage a massive pull may be noted, after the turbulence stops the reaction is complete, if the reagents are no longer sticking to the flask you are done, if not sure, heat up to small boil, nothing happens then you&#039;re done.<br /><br />Great so now you have your chill almost finished!<br /><br />Add 100ml dH2O (if used 30g of pseudo) after the reaction is cooled, shake it and get all mixed into solution, now boil this for 10 minutes on the hot plate.<br />Get a filter ready, pre soak it with water to avoid chill loss.<br />Dump in your chill you just brewed, filter until all Red Phosphorus is out of the water/chili solution.<br />DON&#039;T THROW AWAY THE RED PHOSPHORUS, SAVE IT YOU CAN REUSE IT.<br />The solution should be clear yellow to colourless, now it&#039;s time to release your amine.<br />Add 25% NaOH solution until pH 13/14, smell your beaker, it should smell like rotten fish/ammonia.<br />This is what you want, that&#039;s the beautiful smell of your chill freebase, additional add 50ml brine to the solution, will avoid emulsion making.<br />Cool the solution in the fridge until it is cold, now extract the chill with 3x 75ml Et2O, wash the extracts with brine, 25% NaOH solution and twice with dH2O separating after each wash.<br />Now dry your Et2O extracts with anhydrous MgSO4, let it stand for 4 hours.<br />It&#039;s time to salt your chili, you can either use a HCl generator and gas it (drip H2SO4 into kitchen salt hose it through drying tube, additional at a trap at the end for any suck backs) to see beautiful methamphetamine HCl precipitating.<br />Other method is evaporating the ether to about 60ml left, add 30ml dH20 to it in a flash with stopper, drip HCl and keep constant eye on the pH of the bottom layer (the one that has your meth hcl dissolved) you want it to be between 7 and 8. Shake it really good after each 7-10 drops of HCl you add so the ether and the hcl mix together and the meth can salt.<br />Once you have achieved the desired pH, get the bottom (water with meth) layer and evaporate it slowly, you should have your desired product after it evaporates.<br />Now you can optionally wash your product using ice cold anhydrous acetone and/or recrystallise.<br />This is done from either absolute Ethanol, methanol or IPA, the trick is to do use as less solvent as possible to dissolve all the meth when the alcohol is boiling, then to cool down as slowly as possible to let big crystals grow, eventually you can evaporate it all.<br /><br />Yield: 50 to 85% depending on a lot of factors.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Chloroform<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pour 500ml of household bleach into a 2000ml beaker and add enough ice cubes to it to cool, measure out 10ml of acetone and mix it in with the bleach and swirl it around gently for 10 seconds to make sure it mixes. This reaction is exothermic (releases heat) so keep an eye on the temperature, add ice cubes if needed to cool the solution. Leave it for 30 minutes for the reaction to complete, sign of the reaction completed is white powderish bubbles (looks like an emulsion) at the bottom, pour off the water/bleach layer once all ice has melted, now separate the chloroform with a separating funnel, wash/distill the chloroform and dry over MgSO4.<br />Store in a brown glass bottle, add some EtOH/MeOH to prevent decomposition if storing for a longer time (decomposes into phosgene gas, nasty!)

The palladium was filtered and washed to reuse, the solution was colourless with 12.7 pH, GAA was added until pH 7 and then the EtOH was removed by vacuum. The remaining solution was made basic using 25% NaOH and extracted with 2x 50ml toluene, the extracts dried over silica and the solvent removed under vacuum. 100ml EtOAc was added to the yellowish oil and dry IPA/HCl was added to pH 7.

There&#039;s a ton of upfront costs with glassware, you have to source numerous non-safrole chemicals that the DEA is watching (if bought together), and you need a very good understanding of chemistry to boot. This is pretty much the reason why no one in the states is making the stuff.

See it as your college course, costs 30-50k for the study but you will make it back in 1-2 years of working. Called investments&nbsp; ;)

				<br /><br />I want to know synthesis of amobarbital and secobarbital. These are barbituriates, very effective, only for responsible users, Amytal and Seconal brand names. Their mix is called Tuinal. tuinal capsules were equally divided these two salts 50mg, 100mg, 200mg capsules. They&#039;re basically extinct in black market and very rarely used. Benzodiazepines changed them but alot of people have nostalgia for these two (or three) and people like me who are young and have access to Silkroad is very interested in finding and trying them (responsibly) because deep down i don&#039;t think Silkroad is gonna last forever, I don&#039;t know why but I just do. So what precursors are needed to make these ? Is the synthesis hard ? If some of you geniouses manage to synthesise and fill the gap (there is huge demand for them believe me) would you be selling them in powders or you would find the time to make precise capsules ? If any of you synthesise them there should be a warning about lethality (they&#039;re safe but not for party with a lot of alcohol or other downers).<br /><br />Another one is methaqualone. basically the same questions as those two barbituriates, I know ruthenium you tried it as a sample and it was freebase. i don&#039;t know about it much but I know it&#039;s in the same boat as those two poor barbs - extinct. So was it real ? How was it ? Did you smoke it ? I heard it&#039;s popular in africa to smoke but harmful to teeth. This methaqualone was some kind of sleeping pill right ? Maybe anyone&nbsp; knows why is it not used no more (only few countries). What precursos you need to make it and how hard it is ? I don&#039;t like to abuse sleeping pills to the point where you high as hell to the point of complete blackout and amnesia and don&#039;t know why some people like it but I&#039;m attracted to things that is hard to get. Well i would like to try to smoke just one time that methaqualone.<br /><br />Also is it possible if you had methaqualone freebase convert it into water soluble HCL and intravenously inject it ?<br />

				I&#039;ve been looking through some archives for funsies and came across someone describing rextalizing methamphetamine by dissolving in hot alcohol and spraying with liquid nitrogen, I was thinking of attempting something similar with isolated D-amph HCl to avoid problems with hygroscopicity(is that even a real word?) however I&#039;m finding it difficult to source relevant solubility profiles for pretty much any amphetamine/d-amphetamine salt besides sulphate. Anyone happen to have info on this?<br /><br />Also, anything on resolution of PPA would be awesome. :D<br />

				To a 250ml babies drinking bottle(Hey, we don&#039;t all have nice glasswear to work with) was added;<br />10ml dH2O<br />20ml Glacial acetic acid<br />30ml Isopropyl Alcohol<br />2g Phenyl-2-nitropropene(Coutesy of drug ape)<br />a knife tip of mercuric nitrate(again, courtesy of drug ape)<br />The bottle was swirled until the P2NP had mostly dissolved, then 4g of aluminium foil previously prepared(1) was added.&nbsp; The reaction proceded vigorously enough that the mixture was put into an ice bath to prevent overflow.&nbsp; After 30 minutes, the bottle was capped and shaken, then left to stand at room temperature for an hour.<br />30g KOH was dissolved in 80ml of water and added to the mixture, which had become a caked sludge.&nbsp; A slightly less violent reaction took place, from which 2 layers formed, a top yellowish layer smelling slightly of unreacted P2NP, and a bottom layer of grey sludge.&nbsp; The mixture was separated, the IPA layer washed with brine, and 1ml H2SO4 in 2ml IPA was dripped in with a syringe.&nbsp; Lots of white powder immediately came out of solution, but couldn&#039;t be isolated due to it going through the coffee filters that were used to filter it.<br /><br /><br />(1) Al foil was prepared by tearing up into strips, then running it through a coffee grinder for about 15 seconds, followed by submersion in 5% NaOH solution for a further 5 minutes, filtering, and washing with fresh H2O.<br /><br />I can see the product there, I just can&#039;t get the damn thing out :(<br /><br /><br />edit: stuck a cigarette filter in the funnel, worked perfectly.&nbsp; Total yield: 1.1g of snow white amphetamine, ~67% of theoretical.
