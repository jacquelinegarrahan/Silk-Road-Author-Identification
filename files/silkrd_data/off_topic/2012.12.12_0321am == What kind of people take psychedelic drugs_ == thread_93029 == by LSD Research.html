				I&#039;m doing a research paper and I was wondering if you people can help me out a little.<br /><br />If you use psychedelic drugs regularly, I would be very appreciative if you would answer the following questions. <br /><br />Feel free to omit any questions you are not comfortable with answering.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />1. Give a rough estimate of how often you take psychedelic drugs (e.g. once a day, once a week, once a month, etc)<br /><br />2. What is your psychedelic drug of choice?<br /><br />3. What is your favourite genre of music?<br /><br />4. What are your three favourite bands?<br /><br />5. Do you drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes?<br /><br />6. Do you use psychedelic drugs for recreational use?<br /><br />7. Do you use psychedelic drugs for spiritual use?<br /><br />8. Do you use psychedelic drugs for self-analysis or self-improvement?<br /><br />9. Do you believe in any kind of spiritual power (however you personally define it)?<br /><br />10. Do you believe in fate or predestination?<br /><br />11. Do you believe in the survival of consciousness after death?<br /><br />12. Do you believe in the existence of any kind of phenomena that would be regarded as &#039;paranormal&#039; (telepathy, remote viewing, astral projection, UFOs, etc)? <br /><br />13. Do you believe that psychedelic drugs have long-term psychological or spiritual benefits?<br /><br />14. Do you subscribe to a political ideology? If so, what is your political ideology&nbsp; (liberal, conservative, socialist, anarchist, libertarian, fascist, etc)?<br /><br />15. Have psychedelic drugs had a negative impact on your life in any way? If so, how?<br /><br />16. Do you have a more introverted or a more extroverted personality?<br /><br />Thank you !

				1. Give a rough estimate of how often you take psychedelic drugs (e.g. once a day, once a week, once a month, etc)<br />Once a month<br /><br />2. What is your psychedelic drug of choice?<br />LSD<br /><br />3. What is your favourite genre of music?<br />Classical<br /><br />4. What are your three favourite bands?<br />Raffi, ICP, *NSYNC<br /><br />5. Do you drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes?<br />I drink on occasion, but rarely to the point of being drunk. I&#039;ve smoked before, but not in the past year.<br /><br />6. Do you use psychedelic drugs for recreational use?<br />Somewhat.<br /><br />7. Do you use psychedelic drugs for spiritual use?<br />Not really.<br /><br />8. Do you use psychedelic drugs for self-analysis or self-improvement?<br />Yes, and this is the main reason I take them. Psychedelics allow you to see the world from a different vantage point and they&#039;re great for personal introspection. <br /><br />9. Do you believe in any kind of spiritual power (however you personally define it)?<br />No.<br /><br />10. Do you believe in fate or predestination?<br />No.<br /><br />11. Do you believe in the survival of consciousness after death?<br />I&#039;d like to think so, but I can&#039;t rationalize it in my head. <br /><br />12. Do you believe in the existence of any kind of phenomena that would be regarded as &#039;paranormal&#039; (telepathy, remote viewing, astral projection, UFOs, etc)?<br />No.<br /><br />13. Do you believe that psychedelic drugs have long-term psychological or spiritual benefits?<br />Possibly, but they&#039;re not the only way to come to these conclusions and using them certainly doesn&#039;t guarantee these benefits either. <br /><br />14. Do you subscribe to a political ideology? If so, what is your political ideology&nbsp; (liberal, conservative, socialist, anarchist, libertarian, fascist, etc)?<br />I&#039;m far left on social issues and center-left on fiscal policies. I&#039;m possibly a libertarian in denial, although I&#039;m still not quite sure.<br /><br />15. Have psychedelic drugs had a negative impact on your life in any way? If so, how?<br />Not really, although I&#039;ve had some bad trips that have temporarily put me in a bad place. <br /><br />16. Do you have a more introverted or a more extroverted personality? <br />Definitely more introverted, although I can break out of my shell on occasion.<br />

				1. Give a rough estimate of how often you take psychedelic drugs (e.g. once a day, once a week, once a month, etc)<br />If you mean enough to trip, then I use psychedelics about once a week, but I often microdose as well, so it&#039;s hard to say.<br /><br />2. What is your psychedelic drug of choice?<br />LSD<br /><br />3. What is your favourite genre of music?<br />Classical<br /><br />4. What are your three favourite bands?<br />Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead<br /><br />5. Do you drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes?<br />No, although I used to drink alcohol<br /><br />6. Do you use psychedelic drugs for recreational use?<br />Yes.<br /><br />7. Do you use psychedelic drugs for spiritual use?<br />Yes.<br /><br />8. Do you use psychedelic drugs for self-analysis or self-improvement?<br />Yes.<br /><br />9. Do you believe in any kind of spiritual power (however you personally define it)?<br />Yes.<br /><br />10. Do you believe in fate or predestination?<br />Yes. <br /><br />11. Do you believe in the survival of consciousness after death?<br />Yes.<br /><br />12. Do you believe in the existence of any kind of phenomena that would be regarded as &#039;paranormal&#039; (telepathy, remote viewing, astral projection, UFOs, etc)?<br />Yes. Psychedelic drugs opened my mind to these phenomena.<br /><br />13. Do you believe that psychedelic drugs have long-term psychological or spiritual benefits?<br />For some people.<br /><br />14. Do you subscribe to a political ideology? If so, what is your political ideology&nbsp; (liberal, conservative, socialist, anarchist, libertarian, fascist, etc)?<br />No, but I am politically conscious.<br /><br />15. Have psychedelic drugs had a negative impact on your life in any way? If so, how?<br />I think the negative effects are also positive. For instance, I find that I am extremely empathetic and sensitive towards people, often painfully so. This is both good and bad.<br /><br />16. Do you have a more introverted or a more extroverted personality?<br />Introverted but I wish I was more extroverted.

It&#039;s not like I have a soundcloud or last.fm account either, so I don&#039;t see how LE could track me down solely on the basis of three incredibly well-known bands.&nbsp; <br /><br />But because I&#039;m a very paranoid individual, I went ahead and edited it anyway.
