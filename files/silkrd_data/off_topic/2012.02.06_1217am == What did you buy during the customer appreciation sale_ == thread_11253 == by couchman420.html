				Unfortunately I only had 2 bitcoins to spend. I wasn&#039;t going to be able to transfer any money in time, so I only had the 2 to spend. But I bought 1 gram of Blatz0r (however you spell it)&#039;s amphetamine paste. I&#039;ll let you all know how it is when it arrives.<br /><br />Here&#039;s to something like this happening again in the future! It was awesome.

				I didn&#039;t really need anything, but ordered 8 gram Commerce Afghane Hash from DutchShop - which turned out to be horrible hash, if there&#039;s even any hash in it! It smells and tastes like candle wax :/ Seems like DutchShop doesn&#039;t give a shit - he doesn&#039;t reply to messages.<br /><br />So not really a good customer appreciation sale for me... <br /><br />UPDATE: DutchShop is awesome! No doubt there! Just got this update:<br /><br />&quot;I have take out the Hash commerce Afghane because the last batch i received was bad hash and remove it out of stock immediately.I stopped the bussines relation ship with the supplier.The few customers i send the hash will get Full refund 100%.&quot;<br /><br />Waiting in my account was a full refund :)!

				I joined SR just as the sale was going on, but unfortunately it had ended by the time I got my hands on BTC and got my head around PGP encryption, damn! I would have liked to get one of the &quot;buy one, get one free&quot; MDMA cap deals, &#039;cos I&#039;m poor at the moment and didn&#039;t have that much to spend. Oh well! Hoping for future discounts.
