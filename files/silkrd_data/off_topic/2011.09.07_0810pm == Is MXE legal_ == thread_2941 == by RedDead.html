				ive tried loads, at the mo mxe is the pick of the bunch but i havent tried the 4-meo-pcp or the camphetamine or whatever its called which seem to be the newest ones, i think if you shop round a bit you may be able to get o-desmethyltramadol and a-ppp too but i never tried them either, also a lot of people love amt, im not a massive fan myself, my experience with that led me to spend hours believing i could phase my hand through an envelope and remove the letter inside without ever opening it if i just kept trying, there was a twitchy paranoia and nausea with it too

				here is a list of chems easily available and still &quot;legal&quot; to those in the uk at least are: MDAI, MPA, MXE, 4-meo-pcp, Etizolam, 5-meo-dalt, AM-2201, am-694, 5-APB, 6-APB, Camfetamine, AMT and phenazepam. many of the ones ive just listed i havent actually tried myself but they are all out there in the clearnet to be bought in pretty much any quantity you want at lab grade quality and within days (can you tell i was into my RCs before i found SR? :P&nbsp; ) <br /><br />also be careful there are some sellers out there who have no morals at all and are just money grabbing bastards, one vendor ive seen is even offering to give away grams of the awful A3A methano (just read the horror stories on bluelight youll see what i mean) so as always do your research, read and then read some more, most boards will not allow any sort of vendor discussion at all so you will have to use your own discretion, contact the seller see if they sound genuine, as with buying drugs of any sort anywhere, be careful, theres sharks out there just waiting to bite

				Yeah, available online or in many head shops.<br /><br />Just remember the come up takes a looooong time, so don&#039;t double-dose until you&#039;ve given it a couple hours.&nbsp; Otherwise, you may have a very intense, and long, night ahead of you.
