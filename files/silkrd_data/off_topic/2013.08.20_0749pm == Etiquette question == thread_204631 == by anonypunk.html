				Do you think it&#039;s acceptable to cancel an order when it is still in processing? <br /><br />What about if the vendor hasn&#039;t responded to your message yet? Or if they are backed up and says so on their page? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been battling this idea in my head because although I have a few orders in my cue. Want to free up some money because...well...obviously to reallocate it elsewhere. <br /><br />My dealer brain says &quot;no and that I never liked it when people cancelled on me.&quot; My buyer brain says &quot;hey it&#039;s a free world man, you waited 3 days for a response, do whatever.&quot; <br /><br />See I don&#039;t want to screw anyone over and if they have already packaged the product but not marked it in transit yet then that would be totally unprofessional. I&#039;m not a child nor do I behave like a selfish brat. I don&#039;t want to tarnish what little reputation I have. Ideas?

Ideas?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally I&#039;d wait another day or two especially if they say they&#039;re backed up on their page. But, can you even use the option to cancel yet? I&#039;ve had an order in since Sun night and can&#039;t cancel for another three days. I will def cancel then if it&#039;s not in transit fo&#039; sho that&#039;s a whole business week to ship, and, I like my orders to go in transit within 3/4 days MAX and will only order with fast/ reliable shippers. <br /><br />However, i think cancelling annoys a lot of sellers. I&#039;ve only done it once ever on here.
