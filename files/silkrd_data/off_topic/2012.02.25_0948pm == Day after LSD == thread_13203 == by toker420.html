				I did acid last night...&nbsp; I kinda feel like getting fucked up somehow tonight. My choices would be:<br />More L<br />Shrooms<br />oxycodone<br />valium<br />alcohol<br />Molly<br /><br />What would you do if you were in my situation?&nbsp; Or should I just sleep, lol <br />

				For me, it would really depend on what I had to do tomorrow.<br /><br />But assuming I was totally free to do whatever, I would take the shrooms and the molly at once, then once the molly started to wear off, pop the oxycodone.&nbsp; Then have several good beers.&nbsp; Probably stouts.&nbsp; I would save the valium to take the edge off tomorrow.<br /><br /><br /><br />...Well, you didn&#039;t say to pick one! :P

				I&#039;d go for more LSD probably, except some molly also and double the dose you took last night.<br />I&#039;m shocked to not see marijuana on your list of drugs. I thought that was some sort of standard.

				Be aware that if you take more LSD you will likely have to dose higher to reach the same point.

				My LSD experiences so far have been pretty shit... I&#039;m admittedly going slow and working up in dose but last time I had 5x &quot;150mg&quot; blotters (so realistically would guess around ~250-300 &quot;real&quot; mg in total) and I had visual distortions and very light hallucinations (if you can even call them that), some increased physical sensitivity, ghost trails etc... but that was it for a few hours, then I spent most of the next 5-6 hours in a cold sweat, unable to go to sleep, and felt like shit for pretty much the next 24 hours.<br /><br />Previous experiences were similar, lower visuals but the same shit run-down feeling for the next day and inability to sleep.
