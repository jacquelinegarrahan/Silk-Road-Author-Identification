				Lol, I take it you mean a lovely letter not a love letter from customs :O) Yep that was us, we sent out all the packages express with no signature. Its our preferred method. Based on past ships and locations, Captain, It should be with you thursday morn and Knomo it should be with you tmoz.

				Right about the seller account, we have been intentionally holding off on that, The reason being the following. <br />If you look on BMR, we have an active seller account there, we have been using the forums and BMR, as a kinda testing floor pre SR, We checked sending product with and without vac packs, different seals, different quality products etc... The reason we did this is because we could afford to test with people there and we didn´t want to tarnish our name on the silk road. Because our acid and opium is fresh people really love it, we only source the best and people do really really like our product. So we got more business than we actually thought we would.. So what we are gonna do is the following. <br />Since the vendor fee´s hiked here, were gonna wait till we sell out of our previous batch, its about 120g of opium and 400 blotters, when we restock we will cross over to silk road... at the current rate by about the first week of Jan. Until then, those who have been sent samples, enjoy them and make sure you let us know how you liked them, also make sure to let us know if you would suggest any modifications to our shipping. If you really really want some of our acid or opium for x-mas we can create you a listing and escrow it. Just send me a message or an email. <br />ACE<br /><br />
