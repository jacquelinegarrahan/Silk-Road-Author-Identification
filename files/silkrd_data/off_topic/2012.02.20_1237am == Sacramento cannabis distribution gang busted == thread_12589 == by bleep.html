The investigation focused on a group of individuals who appeared to have laundered over $1,000,000 in cash deposits into fictitious business and personal accounts. The deposits were made in states on the east coast, and then withdrawn the following day in Sacramento. <br />&nbsp;<br />The investigation identified a location where the individuals would meet each day, and then package and ship parcels weighing between seven and twelve pounds each. These parcels were shipped to states including New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Illinois. Multiple parcels were seized during this investigation, and found to contain high-grade marijuana. Additional parcels seized on the east coast and destined for Sacramento were found to contain cash and money orders.<br /><br />This three-month investigation commenced with the service of search warrants being served yesterday at three locations in the Sacramento area. Yesterday&#039;s efforts yielded the discovery of two marijuana grows, three weapons, several pounds of processed and packaged marijuana, approximately $70,000 in cash, and the arrests of the five aforementioned individuals. This investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests are expected to be made.<br /><br />Bail is set at $200,000 for Curry and Hunter, and $1,000,000 for Renta, Wilder and Wilson.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Doesn&#039;t sound like they had enough emphasis on security.<br /><br />Still sad to see people imprisoned for selling a plant.

				Well, this sucks. I&#039;m not sure what they meant by &quot;high-grade marijuana&quot;, but there aint THAT many importers of fire, medical quality shit here on the east coast. That&#039;s why I&#039;m glad I found SR.. no more worrying about finding exotics at a fair price.
