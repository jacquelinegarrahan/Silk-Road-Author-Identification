				Seems like there may be a DEA web operation occurring right now. As stated in the title, as of this posting Safeorscam is down, euphoricknowledge is down, and undergroundlegals is down. I&#039;m guessing other sites are down as well. The moderation staff of EK left this pastebin message tonight:<br /><br />&quot;Dear users of Euphoric Knowledge,<br />&nbsp;<br />It is in this time of great duress we must inform you about what has been going on, and what the current site admins have been trying to cover up.<br />&nbsp;<br />Woot has indeed been arrested and is in custody. We have little faith that he will not roll on us. Here is proof of his arrest...&quot; (it goes on.. google it if you&#039;d like to read more).<br /><br />Not meaning to feed any paranoia, but in light of the recent Farmers Market bust this seems like more than a coincidence. Stay safe yall...<br /><br />&lt;2

				billy: I believe that&#039;s just the whois <br /><br />Regarding EK/UGL, these two were certainly taken down as a preemptive measure. I can&#039;t say for SoS though..

The community is ... my opinion doesn&#039;t matter.<br />UGL - I&#039;m not on it. Nor do I care, but my guess is it is similar to EK.

				It seems safe or scam is just shut down to be shut down and if the RC marketplaces are in a place where RC&#039;s aren&#039;t yet criminalized then they should be fine too.
