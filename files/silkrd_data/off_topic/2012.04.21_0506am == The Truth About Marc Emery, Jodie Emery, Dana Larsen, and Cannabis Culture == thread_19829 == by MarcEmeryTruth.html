				The Truth About Marc Emery, Jodie Emery, Dana Larsen, and Cannabis Culture<br /><br /><br />Hello, I hope everyone had a great 420, now that it has ended I felt compelled to write this after reading: http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/silt8/when_youre_having_fun_smoking_your_green_funk/ and upon learning that Jodie Emery and her Cannabis Culture groupies co-opted the Vancouver 420 event this year for their own personal gain. For those that are not aware the Vancouver 420, it is a heavily commercialized propaganda event that promotes a circle jerk involving Jodie Emery, Marc Emery, Cannabis Culture, and nothing else. This is a public event that requires no organization other than that a bunch of people to come out and have a good time smoking and socializing. 420 is currently &quot;run&quot; by Jodie Emery and the Cannabis Culture. They bully everyone else that shows an interest in running the event. Something happened this year, &quot;Princess&quot; Jodie Emery decided to charge vendors $500 for a spot at this years 420. Vancouver&#039;s 420 is run in a public location at the Vancouver art gallery. The art gallery is often used for many public events, none of which ever charge anyone anything to setup a table because it is a public place. Even Occupy Vancouver took place here. Jodie Emery managed to con the public out of $24,000 because she claimed soul ownership over a public place. She claims that the yearly event costs her $20,000 to put on. What exactly are expenses being spent on? Cannabis Culture related booths, their yearly self promoting speech, and a band. What makes the Cannabis Culture booth so special? If they were going to spend 20k on a popular band it could make sense, but it&#039;s usually just some random people doing it for fun and for free. She is a liar, she and her cronies are pocketing all of the money. Just look at these pictures: https://yfrog.com/a/img815/4927/hylhr.jpg https://p.twimg.com/Aq8svBvCEAEtPeD.jpg:large https://p.twimg.com/Aq8tKjLCAAAqz0D.jpg:large It&#039;s all about them and no one else. They don&#039;t care about anyone else, such as those who have been the victim of harsh marijuana laws around the world. There are thousands of other activists out there who deserve an equal voice, but they aren&#039;t going to get it. In their eyes they are celebrities, and everyone else is beneath them.<br /><br /><br />Today I&#039;m going to expose what &quot;Prince&quot; Marc Emery, &quot;Princess&quot; Jodie Emery, Dana Larsen, Cannabis Culture, and everyone they associate for what really are.<br /><br /><br />Most of you that have heard of Marc Emery probably only know one fact about him. That he was put in jail for selling seeds. If you actually believe Marc Emery makes a living off of his Seed Bank and Cannabis Culture you are greatly mistaken. The Seed bank was started by Marc and Dana with their money from their mail order marijuana websites. The Seed Bank was just a &quot;legitimate&quot; mail order business substituting seed for weed. And the Marijuana Party? Laughable. The Marijuana party will never be respected. When someone thinks of the Marijuana party they think of the stereotypical stoner packing a bong. They are scared to even imagine this kind of person trying to lead their country. Marc Emery and Dana Larsen both realize this and they are profiting off of it in different ways. Marc Emery further promotes the stereotype of the college stoner, just like many other &quot;marijuana activists&quot;. He is dumbing down the pro-marijuana collective. He doesn&#039;t want it legalized, he and he alone wants to be able to profit off of it. He is to marijuana what modern rappers are to rap music. Rappers used to be respectable, they made great music, now they are just a tool of degradation towards the black community. Marc Emery has actually tried running for mayor of Vancouver multiple times, he will never win. Let&#039;s just assume he did win, it wouldn&#039;t be for anything he&#039;s done, it would be because smokes pot and his name is well known. He would be Vancouver&#039;s Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br /><br />Dana Larsen realized that he can only ever be a pawn, he however choose a slightly different path than Marc Emery. He&#039;s given up on the marijuana party in an attempt at becoming a &quot;professional politician&quot; with the NDP. Dana Larsen just cleaned up his appearance a bit and put on a suit and joined a main stream political party in hopes those who don&#039;t know anything about him will vote for him because they vote NDP. His only way to ever get elected is ride what little fame Marc Emery has, and with his Marc&#039;s &quot;blessing&quot; acquire votes from people who only like him because he does drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />Neither of them have any real political beliefs, they just claim they want pot legalized as a way to get elected, no one else has any idea about their other political beliefs. The sad truth though is that no one gets elected for what they believe, they get elected for how they appear. There isn&#039;t a single political party that will ever legalize marijuana. Those who say they want to legalize drugs are lying. These are the same people who when a vote comes up to legalize marijuana they will vote no, just so that they can continue to profit at the expense of others.<br /><br /><br />What does Dana Larsen do when he isn&#039;t trying to be a professional politician? He is running non profit dispensaries. Dana Larsen has a near monopoly on Vancouver&#039;s dispensaries, meanwhile the competitions dispensaries get raided or burned down: http://www.marijuana.com/news/2012/02/police-execute-first-ever-raid-on-a-vancouver-dispensary/ He is also a co-owner of the Seed Bank.<br /><br /><br />Where did Marc Emery and Dana Larsen get the money to start all of these businesses? Selling drugs of course. Marc Emery believes you should break any law you disagree with, even age is just a number to him ;)<br /><br /><br />Today I am going to expose who owns Canada&#039;s most popular mail order marijuana websites.<br /><br /><br />Dana Larsen and Marc Emery own and operate the following websites:<br /><br /><br /><br />Bud Buddy<br /><br />- Site: budbuddy.biz<br /><br />- IP: 85.158.202.233<br /><br />- ISP: Cyso Hosting B.V., Alkmaar, The Netherlands<br /><br />- Uses PMWiki software: http://www.budbuddy.biz/BB/Home?action=source<br /><br />- Does not ship internationally, Canada only<br /><br />- $20 shipping fee, $50 for Newfoundland, Nunavut, Yukon and Northwest Territories<br /><br /><br /><br />Pot By Post:<br /><br />- Site: pbpost.org<br /><br />- IP: 85.158.202.233<br /><br />- ISP: Cyso Hosting B.V., Alkmaar, The Netherlands<br /><br />- Uses PMWiki software: http://www.pbpost.org/Main/Home?action=source<br /><br />- Ships Internationally and in Canada<br /><br />- $20 shipping fee<br /><br /><br /><br />Mary Jane Mail<br /><br />- Site: maryjanemail.biz<br /><br />- IP: 62.129.139.162<br /><br />- ISP: VirtualXS Internet BV, The Netherlands<br /><br />- Uses PMWiki software: http://www.maryjanemail.biz/MJM/Home?action=source<br /><br />- Does not ship internationally, Canada only<br /><br />- $20 shipping fee<br /><br /><br /><br />Bud Brother<br /><br />- budbrother.biz<br /><br />- IP: 85.158.202.233<br /><br />- Seems to be an admin panel<br /><br /><br /><br />Previous Websites: angelfire.com/folk/budbuddy powow.com/budbuddy doobiecentral.com xmail.net/budbuddy &quot;Jays Joints&quot; marijuanahomedelivery.ca cannabisadomicile.ca<br /><br /><br />All of these websites at one time or another have had links to cannabis culture and cannabis culture related websites. This can be verified by using http://archive.org/web/web.php You can even find quotes from Dana Larsen recommending his own services! What better way to give their new mail order website credibility?<br /><br /><br />&quot;Bud Buddy is reliable and honest. I recommend his services.&quot; - Dana Larsen, Editor of Cannabis Culture Magazine<br /><br /><br />Another link to cannabis culture is that their websites all same similar CSS code! They even share similar styling, layout designs, and the same graphic artist was used for all of the websites! Overtime they&#039;ve used different web designers to change up the layouts all together, you can really notice the difference in design between certain layouts. Although all of their previous layouts are available on http://archive.org/web/web.php ! As of late they&#039;ve stopped allowing bots access their mail order sites all together and have use robots.txt or meta tags.<br /><br /><br />In the beginning when they were trying to promote their own mail order websites they decided it was better to create multiple websites as a way to give the illusion of choice! They would frequently run their ads for ALL their websites in magazines such as High Times, and even their own magazine Cannabis Culture!<br /><br /><br />What&#039;s worse is that they refused to review, advertise, or even link other mail order websites! Discussion of them on the forum was banned! http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/08/11/Mail-order-marijuana No mention of the many other mail order websites, even has a link to their own dispensary<br /><br /><br />Even their friends do the same thing when reviewing their services: http://bigbudsmag.com/grow/article/mail-order-marijuana-hash-oil-hashish-november-2011 Mary Jane Mail and Pot by Post links only<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Alright so now they operate a bunch of different websites right, now I&#039;ll show you how they manipulate their customers further.<br /><br /><br />A common tactic used on Bud Buddy is to password protect their homepage, locking out individuals who rely on their service. Their excuse is that they are at &quot;peak capacity&quot; and are unable to fulfill anymore orders. Currently Bud Buddy has the following message: &quot;NO NEW CLIENTS We are not accepting new clients at this time. If you are a current client, you can continue to contact us through our usual email address. If you have not ordered before then please check back in a few weeks. Thank you. &quot;<br /><br /><br />I thought these types of people were supposed to be compassionate? they are called compassion clubs after all<br /><br /><br />As a result of shutting off access to customers who rely on their service, you are left having to search elsewhere for marijuana.<br /><br /><br /><br />This leaves you with two options:<br /><br />1. You ask your friends or acquaintances if they know of a way for you to acquire some marijuana.<br /><br />2. Find an alternative internet mail order service.<br /><br /><br /><br />- The first option has the potential to put you into some sketchy situations if you&#039;re unfamiliar with who you&#039;re dealing with. Chances are you don&#039;t know much about them, or even what kind of quality of product they have; not everyone has the luxury of dealing with Saul from Pineapple Express. Traveling to their place can be a problem, especially if you are house bound and rely on a delivery service. Even the location can be an issue, this can lead you into bad parts of town. The traffic to dealers house can raise suspicion of of others, this will result in a higher chance of you getting in to trouble with the law should they be watching, or rival drug dealers or gangs who could rob your dealer because of the large amounts of product and cash on hand. You could even be the target.<br /><br /><br />- The second option is a lot safer. Mail order Marijuana is often advertised in Magazines and on websites such as the Cannabis Culture and High Times. There are numerous forums that have reviews of the various mail order services. The reviews give a lot of insight into who can be trusted with your money, the quality of the product, and the speed of the delivery. Mail order also gives you the security of having tracked numbers so that you can monitor your shipment, you are even offered a replacement order should it not arrive. The best feature of all is that it even gives you plausible deniability, you can claim you have no idea how the package ended up at your place or that you even ordered it.<br /><br /><br />The problem with the second option is that because Cannabis Culture has in the past advertised Bud Mail in the past it gives them credibility that their other mail order services advertisements are legit also. This means users are more likely to trust their recommendations over that of another website or magazine!<br /><br /><br />There are only two other mail order services that they have advertise Pot By Post and Mary Jane Mail. Mary Jane Mail is their newest addition, they are trying to build up a customer base before they decide to limit those who can purchase via that website. Their real money make is Pot by Post, it is ALWAYS open to new customers.<br /><br /><br /><br />What is the difference&nbsp; between Pot By Post, Bud Buddy, and Mary Jane Mail?<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s take a look at the cannabis culture link http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/08/11/Mail-order-marijuana<br /><br />This is what they have to say about Bud Buddy:<br /><br />&quot;For non-medical users in Canada, the best choice for mail-order marijuana is Bud Buddy, which has been selling buds by mail for over seven years. With a wide selection of marijuana strains, hashes, foods and other pot products, Bud Buddy has earned a solid reputation for quality and integrity. Mary Jane Mail is a newer Canada-only company which is also getting a good reputation.&quot;<br /><br /><br />And Pot By Post:<br /><br />&quot;For international clients, the best two choices are Jays Joints and Pot By Post. Jay has been in business since 2005, and has a great reputation for stealth shipping and high-quality products. Pot By Post is a newer entry into the field, but has already developed a solid following of satisfied customers. Both will ship anywhere in the world.&quot;<br /><br /><br />What is the REAL difference?<br /><br /><br />International mail orders are supposed to come with an extra premium, which is why Pot by Post will cost extra. At first glance prices will seem somewhat similar, but that is not the case.<br /><br /><br />Mary Jane Mail is selling 28 grams of their highest grade for $275<br /><br />Bud Buddy&#039;s is selling 28 grams of their highest grade for $285.<br /><br />Pot By Post is selling 30 grams of their ONLY grade of marijuana for $290<br /><br /><br />In reality Pot By Posts only grade of marijuana is Bud Buddy&#039;s/Mary Jane Mail&#039;s grade C.<br /><br /><br />Mary Jane Mail is selling 28 grams of Grade C for $150<br /><br />Bud Buddy&#039;s is selling 28 grams of Grade C for $185<br /><br /><br />What&#039;s worse is that since Pot By Post ships internationally it doesn&#039;t come with a tracking number! So they can very easily say they shipping your shipment when in reality they smoked it.<br /><br /><br />They are making up to $140 extra just by creating a FALSE reality of unavailability! They don&#039;t care if you can&#039;t afford their &quot;medicine&quot;, they care about the money, they rather sell you garbage weed for a premium.<br /><br />Bud Buddy and Pot by Post are hosted on the SAME IP! It is BULLSHIT that Bud Buddy can&#039;t ship internationally!<br /><br /><br /><br />Alright well, let&#039;s say you don&#039;t care about mail order and you would rather buy some marijuana in person? Well it&#039;s a good thing they&#039;ve got that covered! Don&#039;t these people want to remain anonymous? No, they don&#039;t care, they feed off of their ego. So they&#039;ve worked out a deal with their suppliers to offer easy access to marijuana in person for you! It&#039;s also in walking distance from the Cannabis Culture, this suits them because they are lazy and want easy access to the one thing they are good at.<br /><br /><br />I would like to present...... The Door!<br /><br />The Door:<br /><br />You can see a picture of the door here (notice the ATM RIGHT next to it) if you input the following address into google maps: &quot;301 West Hastings Street, Vancouver&quot; This is the address for the New Amsterdam Cafe. Zoom into first person and then look across the street and up to the right a bit at the weird awning roof thing and then at the door with the posters all over it. It says &quot;SHOWROOM SPACE &amp; OFFICES FOR RENT&quot;<br /><br /><br />You requirements to enter &quot;The Door&quot; are as follow:<br /><br />You must start walking starting at the corner of Homer and Hastings that is on the side of street that &quot;The Door&quot; is on, not the side that has the &quot;New Amsterdam Cafe&quot;.<br /><br />You must walk all the way down Hastings until you reach Cambie. Then you must cross the street at the crosswalk. If you jay walk or cross at Hamilton you will not be granted access to &quot;The Door&quot;. You are being recorded and watched.<br /><br />Once you have crossed the street you must walk to either Marc Emery&#039;s Cannabis Culture Headquarter or the New Amsterdam Cafe. Once inside buy one thing. Rolling papers are recommended.<br /><br />You may now leave the store and cross back across the street to &quot;The Door&quot;. Once at the door ring the door bell. When the bouncer answers the door you must say &quot;I&#039;m with the band&quot;.<br /><br />You are now able to go inside and purchase marijuana. An ATM is available outside, but you must have your cash on you before hand. Acquire the cash before ringing the door bell.<br /><br /><br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Do NOT ask people who are coming outside if you can buy marijuana, you are in &quot;gangster&quot; run territory.<br /><br />Police often patrol the neighbor hood, specifically the alley behind &quot;The Door&quot; where they shake down people who are selling drugs in the wrong area. They won&#039;t bother you if you aren&#039;t selling drugs.<br /><br />If you are not part of this &quot;gang&quot; and you are caught selling drugs you will be beat and robbed, or shaken down by the police if you are lucky.<br /><br />You can not buy something from the two stores right next to &quot;The Door&quot; it won&#039;t work.<br /><br />There are drug dealers hanging around the Victory Square park, and they will take you down into the public bathrooms (Hamilton and Hastings) to sell you drugs.<br /><br /><br />&quot;The Door&quot; is connected to either the Vietnamese gangs or the hells angels. The Vietnamese are usually just the growers and only sell by the pound. They have huge warehouses full of drugs all over the city where they will sell you drugs, this will sell you smaller amounts, possibly part of the deal worked out with cannabis culture.<br /><br />This is where Marc Emery gets his marijuana from for his mail order businesses, and Dana Larsen gets his marijuana for his dispensaries. They run a business, they need to get their marijuana as cheap as possible, they don&#039;t care if it is good or not.<br /><br /><br />The Vietnamese gangs have many grow ops all over Vancouver. They traffic people into countries such as Canada and the UK. The Vietnamese people make deals with the local gangs in their country. They gangs offer to pay to get them out of their country and into western countries in exchange for them helping them &quot;work&quot; for a bit to pay off their debt. The Vietnamese gangs then keep the person they &quot;helped&quot; as slaves and force them to grow marijuana. They are kept slaves until the grow op is usually busted. The worker has to take the blame for the grow op, even though officials know that he was a slave, if he tells anyone who he was working for the Vietnamese gangs, the gangs will murder their family back in Vietnam. The worker is then sent to prison and once his sentence is up he is forced to return to Vietnam, once in Vietnam the gangs will then force the slave to pay for all of the equipment and everything the gang spent on him. If you are buying marijuana in Vancouver there is a high chance it was grown by slaves. If you are going to buy marijuana please make sure you buy it from people who are not affiliated with gangs. Cannabis Culture is unable fill all of their needs solely on &quot;ma and pop&quot; or hippie grows. They must get their marijuana in bulk from the gangs of Vancouver. Their mail order businesses go through massive amounts of marijuana. Cannabis Culture isn&#039;t shy about showing video of their friends grow ops, which would be classified as &quot;ma and pop&quot; or hippie grows, this is the higher quality marijuana. They usually save this stuff for themselves to smoke. They sell the Vietnamese marijuana to the people they don&#039;t care about, their &quot;patients&quot; and followers.<br /><br />

Lastly I will leave you with following.<br /><br /><br />Does Marc Emery deserve to be in jail for selling seeds? No.<br /><br />Does Marc Emery and his associates deserve to be in jail for selling Marijuana? No.<br /><br />Marc Emery and his associates however should be looked into for racketeering, running a monopoly, and using force against others to ensure that.<br /><br />Marc Emery does it for the profit, not for the cause.<br /><br /><br />The war on drugs is a war on the people. It is a monopoly and the government is at the top. Drugs are just another weapon the government uses to suppress the people. Designer drugs are legal. &quot;Natural&quot; drugs are illegal and come with heavy penalties if you are caught. Have you ever wondered why every single city in the country has a large supply of every possible drug? Day or night you can get any drug you want, chances are someone is willing to hand deliver it to you within the hour. Where are all these drugs coming from? Last time I checked the coca plant wasn&#039;t a plant that grew in North America. Even if you managed to destroy every coca and opium plant on the earth for a whole year there would be enough reserves to continue to supply the world for that whole year as if nothing ever happened. At one time the Federal Reserve stored reserves of every drug imaginable in their vaults, we would never know if they continue to do this or not as we cannot audit them, they are above the government. The amount of drugs required to supply everyone in the nation on a daily basis is an insane amount, there is no way that drug mules jumping the border are able to fill this supply alone. The borders are laughable in themselves. They aren&#039;t secure, they aren&#039;t meant to be. We are always told about how we have to secure them for national security to stop terrorists, illegal immigrants, or drug smugglers, yet this will never happen. The real source of drugs come from the government/military/CIA and their convoys containing classified shipments that they are unable to disclose the contents of due to &quot;national security&quot;. Another source comes from their massive amounts of tunnel networks dug out with nuclear powered tunnel boring machines.&nbsp; The war on drug war is well organized and operates everyday without a hitch. It&#039;s called organized crime for a reason. The media is happy to report all the small fry&#039;s killing themselves and innocent civilians. All while the government uses the excuse that legalizing drugs would give these people more power.<br /><br /><br />In reality Marc Emery, Dana Larsen, and Cannabis Culture are but a pale blue dot in the drug trade. Thankfully.<br /><br /><br />

				All I need to know is Marc did help spread a lot of seeds and was a very outspoken activist, but he is also a sick fuck behind closed doors.<br /><br />So, he has some good and bad qualities.

				On his forum he advised some 17 year old kid to get a girl all messed up on coke and alcohol or pills forget the drug combination in order to take advantage of the situation so that he would have a good chance of having anal sex with her.<br /><br />What grown man says stuff like that to a teenager?

				I think he might of pissed off the DEA a little by taunting them all the time openly, by basically saying, &quot;I will get as many seeds illegally into the USA as possible and you can&#039;t stop me.&quot; He was a very in your face kind of guy which is good sometimes if done strategically. Taunting any government organization of the US is just asking for it.<br /><br />He gave away a lot of seeds and helped people with legal fees, so that was generous. I guess his wife might of been underage when they first became involved if I remember correctly, but not for sure. I think he is just a big weirdo pervert in his personal life.

				PIMP or prince?<br />MARC EMERY PIMP OR PRINCE OF POT ????<br />I guess I must start clearing the air before the truth gets buried and forgotten<br />HE IS CERTAINLY NOT A HERO TO ME<br />So much damage has been done by this foolish ego maniac politically&nbsp; here in Canada that it must be&nbsp; addressed and corrected<br />I will try to do that<br />For starters??<br />Michelle Rainy was one of the BC3 ….<br />her… emery and greg&nbsp; were the&nbsp; 3<br />And she was really responsible for a lot of things that emery takes credit for<br />even though he did not do it<br />She passed away Oct 20 2010 and so&nbsp; it can be&nbsp; released as more public&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess&nbsp; what she really thought of him and his joke fake crusade<br />Just to stop more wasted resources and time<br />I wont allow our cause to be side tracked by garbage and lies<br />TO READ ONLY HER THOUGHTS ……………SCROLL DOWN<br />But as info to others<br />People are so misinformed and ignorant about this fool<br />And no one did more damage in Canada politically than this pompous idiot<br />I will add much as I go but lots is out there in cyberspace to explain the truth<br />Before he tried to clean up the truth and after the 2005 bust<br />Web sights like Treating Yourself<br />http://www.treatingyourself.com/vbulletin/index.php<br />Is a good one<br />THC in Toronto<br />http://www.torontohemp.com/phpBB3/index.php<br />Although to read what it says now hidden&nbsp; in the members only section you need to be a member obviously look for the “”NO HOLDS BARRED”&quot;”……….. SECTION<br />(here is a selection of comments though )<br />by shavluk » Sat Aug 22, 2009 11:19 am<br />Hey I never said emery did not use some of the money …..for some good<br />Yes …some sent in for the most “expensive seeds” out there….he<br />did use his crumbs not being used by the 4 or 5 women he kept to fight so that<br />he could advertise those “highest priced cannabis seeds” MORE !!<br />He fought the law to be able to sell you !!! the highest priced cannabis seeds<br />It had nothing to do with your rights<br />it was only emery’s rights or greed ..thats all it was …<br />Yes he was taking some of those dollars from others and giving it to a lawyer<br />who did the actual fighting…so he could sell more magazines with the highest<br />priced seeds someone else was not paid for<br />emery compensated his lost money by yes not paying my friends who provided the<br />SEEDS !!!! IN THE FIRST PLACE !!<br />Some do not know the whole or real story and just want some thing else to<br />believe in…have fun children !! fill your booties<br />I should say I do not hate emery…hate requires some caring which I do not<br />I do hate some of what he has done or paid to have done…though<br />And his big mouth and mean streak<br />I also do not like the precedent he now sets as anyone else will now be going<br />to jail …..now…..just for selling seeds..think about that one as it used to<br />be a two hundred dollar fine and now will be jail !!!<br />I say for the record he is a malicious greedy self centered ego maniac and I<br />took a lot before I wrote him off…..ripping off my wife over something he<br />ordered himself was the last straw !!<br />I care squat who you all like or do not but as you see…no one should cross<br />me……. as I never forget or quit fighting back !!!<br />emery should have been giving away the seeds …think about it ???<br />especially if he ripped off some of my grower friends as said<br />or been the CHEAPEST SELLER !!…out there …YES??<br />I MEAN IF HE WANTED TO “”OVER GROW”&quot;” ANYTHING….<br />YES …. MORE THAN JUST HIS OR WHAT HIS BROTHERS BANK ACCOUNT !!????<br />I will always credit mark for spending money in the local paper so that us 79<br />candidates could get together in the first place to be organized to fight back<br />as we did in 2000 or 2001…like I said it was him who caused my rather<br />distrustful attitude of anything he now does<br />for<br />organized political information<br /><br />OR HERE&nbsp; ……<br /><br />http://www.thepolitic.com/archives/2005 … class-act/<br />“”I did a little digging.. Anyone with a daughter should cringe, Emery posts publically about which DRUGS eg: Coke, will get a woman to perform what sexual acts… *shudder*<br />“#1 2C-B. This will,make her an incredible sucking, vibrating, bouncing, pleasure seeking fiend for 4 - 5 hours straight. Absolutely 100% goddamn right … We should put it in their food. Daily. Its unfortunately, incredibly difficult to obtain, but I don’t know why? …Then its agreed, for the sake of us all, let’s put it in chocolate so they just absorb small quantities on a regulat basis. ”<br />“#4 Cocaine. If you want to fuck her ass, this is deriguer. ”<br />http://www.cannabisculture.com/forums/s … Post215774<br />(of course the links don’t work any more ….<br />but I have them all saved !!<br />like this comment )<br />“”In fairness to Emery, these two particular quotes should be completed.<br />In the thread on sex linked to in the update, Emery goes on to write:<br />I’ve been fucked up the ass by a guy too in my early years”&quot;<br />I hope someone is saving this stuff and forwarding it to the attention of the oblivious mainstream media, once people start paying attention these type of quotations and candur tend to…disappear.”&quot;<br />They can not …..as they are saved ….as I say<br />sorry this guy is an idiot who caused all his own problems<br />no credible people will bother<br />only annony’s who hide and who are irrelevant<br />more here as well<br />http://www.smalldeadanimals.com/archives/002489.html<br />where it says………<br />“”&quot;I continue to be just amazed at the Emery defenders and apologists.<br />Is this really appropriate or becoming behaviour for a public figure worthy of all the ink and press comparing him to gandhi and mlk jr and forwarding his personal and political agenda?<br />Would we not hold social conservative, or any other social activists to a higher standard than we are Emery and cease giving them public credability if their true extremist philosophies were revealed in such extensive and offensive detail?<br />Emery’s anti-semetic ignorance is NOT a left/right matter of ignorance as Libby Davies was quick to note her own extreme offence to the anti-semetic characterizations made by Emery and his organization. It’s a matter of Canadian sensabilities, and if you think Canadians would let this guy into their homes or to lecture them on marijuana laws after calling the Justice Minster (who is a jewish human rights defender) a NAZI JEW, and talking about using various drugs to yes elicit the desired sexual activities from women. AS for it being consensual, anyone see that part about “we should slip it in their food”? HARDLY sound consenual to me, sounds like something Mr. Emery may have done in the past and it doesnt like he’s counselling others to do the same. Where the hell dose this guy get off publicly saying this stuff? Would any politician/person in public life get away with this and get nothing but smells like roses coverage in the media?<br />I did even MORE digging, and here is some more nuggets to add to Emery’s hall of shame. I’d like to continue to see his defenders try and justify this, and yes there is oh so much more…<br />“Judith Retchen, of the Superior Court of Washington D.C. sentenced a man, this man, this quadriplegic with a breathing apparatus, to jail for 10 days … Jonathan Magbie died in jail. Murdered by the state; murdered by Judge Judith Retchen. … part of me says “kill that judge, kill judge Judith Retchen; somebody, some American with any compassion, sympathy, and patriotism should kill this judge; it would be an act of mercy for our culture, it would be an act of mercy for all peoples of the United States; this is the devil put behind a desk, sent out to murder people”<br />So there you have it all you Emeryheads out there, Emery not only calls the Justice Minister a NAZI JEW, tells people what drugs to slip in women and girls foods to make their judgment just off enough to enter into sex acts they might not under sober conscience — THE LEADER OF A PROVINCIAL PARTY PUBLICLY MUSED AND COUNSELLED HIS FOLLOWERS THAT KILLING A US SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE WOULD BE A COMPASSIONATE ACT.<br />SOURCE; http://bcmarijuanaparty.com/archive/ret … hings.html<br />But hey this is Marc Emery we’re talking about, right? and this is about Canada’s horrible evil marijuana laws and our threatened soverignty!<br />This isn’t about a man who knowing full well what the risks and reprocussions would be, sold millions of dollars of illegal drugs through the mail across the border and now expects the media to spin this in a whole sovereignty debate so he can get off the hook. ….right?!<br />I dont care how you feel about the marijuana laws. Breaking laws in other countries, especially knowing full well what you are doing, that it is illegal, and that there are reprocussions, that is the issue here. Not to mention THE CONTENT OF THE CHARACTER of a man who the media likes to compare to Martin Luther King Jr.<br />Where dose it end?”&quot;<br />OR HERE<br />http://cannabisculturecult.blogspot.com/<br />==================================================================<br />BOTTOM LINE ???<br />marc emery is and always was a phony and his crap about being extradited is also a joke as he was never extradited …he went voluntarily to stop the canadian government from taking his store..or his museum to himself …for “Possession of Proceeds of crime”&quot;<br />Just pipe up and I will provide volumes of&nbsp; other stuff and plan to set the record straight so that people do not waste time on the pimple of pot while we need them politically instead

				====================================================================<br />*************************&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LETTER FROM MICHELLE RAINY…RIP *************************************<br />Here is what Michelle Rainy really thought though<br /><br />raineydays<br /><br />emailed copy to me<br />show details 5/7/10<br />Saturday, August 29, 2009 3:57 PM.<br />Marc I did all your dirty work while you lied cheated and deceived. Took <br />abuse from you and all your crazy women,catered to all your whims and <br />theirs. In the mean time business’s had to be run and paid. You constantly <br />committed money to illegitimate individuals while starving the very business <br />that was profiting. You betrayed me more than any other man including my <br />father. You never once protected me as I had protected you all that time <br />ago. My 11 marriage to (XXXX) failed because of my 110% commitment to you , <br />my choice. Having no love and only working, watching your hedonistic life <br />made my soul ache for some kind of comfort, sadly that comfort came from <br />another fraud (XXXX), it lasted 4 months and yes I married him to keep him in <br />Canada but then divorced him cleaning up my own mess without causing damage <br />to the business(he had me arrested coming off the ferry 2003). He abused me <br />physically and mentally the proof was a glass bong still embedded in a wall <br />at the store he threw at me. You should have sided with your ‘Greatest <br />Partner’ , your ‘Angel’ the one who protects you when your fucking numerous <br />women while engaged to another, the one who took personal loans to pay for <br />seeds, the one who gave $15000 of divorce money to your spoiled staff at CC <br />so they could get paid, the one who never took the spot light and hid in the <br />basement like cinderalla cleaning ,organizing ,stream lining, using my <br />precious Emilie ,her address sending seeds which the DEA new and <br />investigated her, borrowing money on her Visa when you would have temper <br />tantrums demanding more money when there was none. You never helped me, only <br />piled on more shit which I smiled and took. Why Why would I endure such <br />bullshit unless I believed in YOU and thought maybe just maybe you would <br />become the next PM or win the Nobel peace prize or the order of Canada, I <br />mommied you to death, brought love and soul to an organization full of <br />greedy bastards. You never cared about my well being, Crohn’s, hell I was <br />given a death sentence last year, multiple cancer surgeries and not once did <br />you try to give love compassion to me Jeff or Emilie. You betrayed me and <br />sold me out to the DEA, jail blogs, CC forums told the whole story and I had <br />no defense, just as you stated on 60 Minutes and every media outlet you have <br />been on ‘everything I did was transparent’ , which of course it was. I never <br />testified against you, only gave the same proffer as Greg and are you <br />accusing him of betrayal too?? I only confirmed what they already knew, <br />which shocked the hell out of me. I took responsibility for my guilt and my <br />country, not burdening myself and others with a 100% guaranteed extradition <br />if dealt with in Canada. I am not in the spotlight at all, accusing me of <br />gaining anything is a joke, from July 29 its been all about you and before <br />that too of course, after you broke your engagement with Cheryl at xmas and <br />brought Jodie forward it became the BC2. Didn’t bother me at all, I <br />preferred to be in the back ground and still am. My shows have little <br />viewers Marc, I receive no attention, I do them to promote everyone and <br />hopefully inspire others to be pro active. As for TY we volunteer, always <br />have, we tried to do the same with you and CC but constant rejection and <br />your dedication to Randy interfered. Other magazines appreciated Jeff and I <br />so they took us on, we need a pay check too. I guess facilitating over 100 <br />exemptions voluntarily, sending and handing out my education packages which <br />include your sites, speaking with Irwin Cotler,Preston Manning,conservative <br />insiders, begging 500 influential people that do not hang out on Facebook <br />for your freedom is fraud.&nbsp; I wore the ‘FREE Marc Emery’ shirt for 62 days <br />straight, NO ON ELSE DID, lobbied for you freedom relentlessly while being <br />embarrassed by the dumb ass female lawyer you hired and payed for an IC <br />ticket too who plead guilty for you in Saskatoon. Narcissistic megalomaniac, <br />which I supported no matter how immoral or unethical. You have tried to <br />humiliate me, demean me, abuse me, tear me down, accuse me of gossip when <br />you are the very one posting your interpretation of your world for all to <br />see. It was impossible to take any time off, xmas was spent doing damage <br />control for you and your mistress’s while you vacationed with your spouse <br />someplace else. You will never know how much pain you caused me. Running a <br />marathon everyday when all I wanted was to end cannabis prohibition with <br />respect and decency.&nbsp; As for legal fees, well you gave me half the store all <br />those years ago as security because of the revolving debt, we owed Emilie <br />from months back for a pile of other shit, I walked out with massive debt <br />which I have been paying back, you have debt as well. I have no idea what <br />was collected for the past 4 years from BC3 promotion. Whatever is left of <br />my fees I will take care of. John Conroy will validate that you did not make <br />a plea deal on my behalf.<br /><br />Michy<br />—————————————————————————————————————–<br /><br />To ever make&nbsp; a real difference<br />people need to forget about the pimple of pot ..<br />the pimp of pot<br />and stand up and get political !!!!<br />THE ONLY PLACE TO TRULY END PROHIBITION..IS WHERE IT STARTED..IN PARLIAMENT<br />Please

our movement<br /><br />Thanks alot mr and mrs fagin”&quot;”&quot;”<br /><br />Seems these two dont want anyone exposing their poster boy to cannabis exploitation in the guise of activism….hahhahhahhaha<br /><br />Here is the post link and then what I said<br /><br />John Shavluk<br />I posted this in response to the emery begging story and obviously one of the Fagins felt it was not for your eyes<br />It was in response to this<br /><br />http://alberta420.ca/index.php.....le&amp;...<br /><br />WOW…What whooooooey !!!<br /><br />Some of you blow me away and just actually make me even howl with laughter !!<br /><br />I sit here driving myself crazy as I try !!… to figure out how the hell I could even get to Ottawa for Jan 12 after years and years of work with in the Liberal Party now has them to where I took the greens 5 years ago and even nearly the ndp 8 years ago (in fact it was at that quebec city ndp attempt that I knew they would never ever help because of penitentiary union workers as did dana larsen and others yet???<br />More whooooey as I watched you all stupidly get orange crush like idiots and ignore a party who had policy to free us )<br /><br />Bizarre now as I see fools thinking they are actually doing activism by giving or spending money to give some one who cowardly volunteered for a jail term then making seeds now a 5 year offence from a 200 dollar fine ….rather than fight after we even gave him $50 grand to do so….and as he had promised to do<br /><br />Instead we watched him spend $80 grand just to stop a head shop owner from using the words cannabis culture and then in fear of loosing his cash cow store with that added (2008) Canadian charge of “possession of proceeds of crime” that you of course never hear about and then go with his tail between his legs trying to become infamous and a martyr as he speculated that he was Ghandi and Martin Luther hahhahha<br /><br />Yes after takin up to $40 grand a MONTH sellin the highest priced seeds on the planet my friends grew hahhahhaha<br /><br />and get this kiddies …..<br />to this day he still makes more than any of those who gave money !!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />WOW<br />Hahahhahhahaa<br /><br />I am still making payments to go to quebec city for the ndp convention and yes the greens one in pictiou nova scotia 2 years later<br />I even sold… more like gave away…. some of my prised possessions just to get there and borrowed to get others there as well hahhaha<br /><br />And now I see this retarded ness<br /><br />When I got the first resolution that would have given re legalized cannabis as a policy in the ndp I tried to get your hero here … the pimple of pot ….to finally sign up in the ndp ….something he still hasnt done by the way ….and come help us….to get off his ass and walk the talk he pretended he did !!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />mark emery (his real name by the way ( tooo many marks in high school so he illegally changed its spelling hahhhahhaa) any way mark openly mused that “””what would he do if we ever did get it legal !!!!!!!!!!!!!”””””<br /><br />And said he wouldnt come<br /><br />Michelle Rainey said to me …””” he said there were too many hot 15 year old girls hangin at the store and he couldnt leave””””<br /><br />What a saint !!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I have worked for 20 years politically on this<br />And the only real answer is where it started and that’s in Parliament !!<br /><br />Where we are now ….with an actual party that could actually do it is<br />……..depending on this convention in Ottawa jan 12 2012<br /><br />I proved I was libelled by elizabeth may and the dead green party and yet I am being bankrupted with their legal fees as the victim and making payments on my own costs yet I proved she lied ….harper I am sure was involved in the sham court and what happened will come out some day !!<br /><br />Now she says she wont bankrupt me if I stop destroying her and the greens and take down my u tubes showing her lies !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Ok screw it ..I have never ever been helped ever except for 100 dollars from Kelly Christie once<br /><br />I don’t ask …as its not my way usually…I say I am the lone stranger in jest because I find so many are silly about what they think activism actually is<br /><br />But ok ….maybe instead of travelling money so jody can fly in and kiss his ass twice a month …. as time goes by<br /><br />How about spending some that isn’t a waste and stands the chance to actually FREE ALL OF US ?????????????????<br />Hmmmm<br />I know I should be in Ottawa and at this convention FOR US !!<br />I was successful being selected as a delegate…..(no doubt I say to be honest I have conversed with many of them for years and they know obviously our work)<br /><br />http://convention.liberal.ca/j.....ate-mari...<br /><br />Its $675 just to book a spot at convention airfare hotel or car rental bed I guess<br /><br />Will any of you help please?<br /><br />Or is it about only helping those who just exploited you and actually did nothing that wasn’t just going to get himself some attention?????<br /><br />Will anyone help me please to help us?????<br /><br />———————————————————————————————————————————-<br /><br />So they were too cowardly to allow my post and as I said I would instead post it here

				Gee I don&#039;t know what the fuck is up Every ones ass If it wasn&#039;t for him and his antics the Canadian pot laws were almost abolished till the Dam DEA threatened Canada.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This man recruited all the great seed companies and rallied them together (which has always been impossible because they all had there arrogance) He pays for the Heroin addiction clinic in east Van out of his own pocket he is also responsible for the safe injection sites in Van and supplies medical marijuana to 2 dispenceries.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He is just like everyone else sick in their own little way.He was stupid for provoking the DEA when he went on the Phil Donahue show and admitted to selling seeds in the states <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason Canada never bothered him was because he paid THE TAXES ON HIS SEED BUSINESS.I grew up in London Ontario with mark in the Gammage area street gang seen and he was always outspoken then to.He has done more to open the eyes of Marijuana use to North America than most true activist have done in 20yrs he donates almost every $ earned to the cause I used his heroin clinic in 2006 to kick my addiction habits and if it was for his free system I would probably be dead or seriously infected with some Dam street disease from sharing dirty needles <br /><br />All I have to say is Thanks Mark for making a difference
