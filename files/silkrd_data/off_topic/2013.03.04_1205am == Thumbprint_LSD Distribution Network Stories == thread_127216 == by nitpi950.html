				Many of us are probably already familiar with the infamous Thumbprint thread on the shroomery:<br /><br />http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/1427364<br /><br />highlights: https://mycotopia.net/forums/botanicals/70632-thumbprint-%5Blsd%5D.html<br /><br />It&#039;s a great read (the first several pages) and I was thinking; being that there are those among us who have been into acid for decades or are now or have been involved in the supply line of LSD, I thought it would be cool if anyone could share stories along the lines of those in the above thread: massive LSD doses, laying sheets, inner workings of the various Family branches, experiences with crystal, good ol&#039; days stories, etc. This stuff is super interesting to me and there&#039;s not enough of it on the clearnet but given our anonymous platform I would think people would find less risk in being more forthcoming.

				I had someone tell me they would squirt a puddle in my palms from a vial and have me dose that way, but I never got the chance to run with those wild cats. I was a newbie back then, but their single liquid droplets felt pretty strong to me. I wonder how much a double-palm puddle would be? Wish we lived in the same country still lol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had Vial liquid dosed in my eye from some pretty freshly suspended liquid - JoR referred to it as the &quot;red eye flight.&quot;&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; I WISH I had sunglasses that night. Red, irritated eyeball, but tripping was nearly-immediate. Maybe it wouldn&#039;t be too bad if it was suspended in a solution of mostly water? Or maybe it&#039;s just the LSD crystal itself that&#039;s irritating to the eye?<br /><br />Sorry if crazy RoA wasn&#039;t exactly what you were looking to include in this discussion, but has anybody IV&#039;d suspended LSD Crystal? Is it safe?

Think LSD crystal hurts? Maybe if you put me in diapers and kept food and water available at hand for a day or two or three? I only say diapers because I assume shit is bound to get all kindsa weird. :o The most single hits I&#039;ve ever eaten all at once was 4 red gel tabs of unknown dosage - the night I was sat down and introduced to Phish :) . I think we listened to 2 shows that night and I couldn&#039;t believe there were only 4 of them! I could have sworn I heard more instruments/voices than that ???

				I would imagine that LSD has a maximum dose response point, a point at which taking any more beyond that does nothing to increase effects, at least not positive ones.

				Every person which have done a Thumbprint from the Families, is now live his life happily and most of them don&#039;t take LSD anymore, so they neither buy drugs on the internet nor read drug trading forums...<br />If you really want to hear such stories you should go to some hippies gatherings around the world...

				Ah what a thread, havn&#039;t read that in years. Would be so good to sit down with some of the old family members, gather round the fire and hear stories of old... <br /><br />Any tips on preparing for a heroic dose? <br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to trying my first large dose of LSD when my order arrives &amp; setting etc is right... Probably start with 500mics and work up to 1000+ with time &amp; courage... Or I&#039;ll shit my pants, bath in feces, see the devil and quit psychedelics altogether but hopefully the former.

				I have some odd ball stories.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I am a child of the 80&#039;s so not stories from the 60&#039;s BUT My mother was a hippy and we did travel with the Dead and a few other groups when I was a kid.. Doing the whole caravan thing... <br /><br />Just to offer up a highlight.. <br /><br />I can recall being about 5 or 6 and sitting in someone&#039;s caravan, The guy normally blew glass pipes and I LOVED watching him. I was sitting under a table someone above me (on the table) was working and kept yelling at me to be still and quit moving so much.. It was not till many, many years later I realized that he was laying mass quantity of LSD ... I guess that&#039;s the thing about kids.. They really are clueless unless someone tells them something.. Many years later it was like a flash back when I saw someone laying LSD again and I even recalled, with crystal clarity, what toys I was playing with at the time.. It is actually one of the sharpest childhood memories I have. Later as a adult I have wondered how much of the LSD-25 had gotten into the air in the process and maybe that&#039;s why its such an odd clear memory for me.. <br /><br />I have others too.. but I thought you guys might get a kick out of that one..

The 60&#039;s were a long time ago, the Dead don&#039;t tour (although many jam bands still do and there is lsd to be found), and the guys from back then are old and retried.&nbsp; Maybe the young guys just care about the money.<br /><br />But I like to think there is still one, they just don&#039;t get caught because they are not the typical dealer who rolls on his friends.&nbsp; For example take Nick Sand, got caught did his time like a man and never said anything about his associates. <br />
