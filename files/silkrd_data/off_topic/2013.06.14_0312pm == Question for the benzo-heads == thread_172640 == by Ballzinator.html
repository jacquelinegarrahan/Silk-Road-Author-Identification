				If you had the choice between a 2mg flunitrazepam pill and two 1mg alprazolam XR pills, which would you choose and why?<br />I&#039;ve never tried flunitrazepam but I&#039;ve tried alprazolam and didn&#039;t like it as much as clonazepam or lorazepam.

				funnily,I haven&#039;t tried either but if given the choice I would go with roofies just from the buzz around them and they are harder to get.

				There is also a seller from Germany xRedBullx that have a listing of 2mg flunirtazepam for around 11 dollar a piece. Seems worth checking up, been waiting for a seller with roophies since i started to walk on the road!

You just have to have an eye for scammers, which I do have so BMR is often the cheaper alternative for me, especially for domestic stuff. I get my weed there too. Better than anything domestic I&#039;ve ever come across on SR.
