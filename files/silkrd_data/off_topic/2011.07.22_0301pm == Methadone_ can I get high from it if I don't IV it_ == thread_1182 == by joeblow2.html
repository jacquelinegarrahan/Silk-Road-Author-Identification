				I have only had methadone wafers a few times, a long time ago, and I was full to the brim all the time with oxy, so I really don&#039;t know if they were any good or not.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried the powder.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to ask someone who has both used them IV and, hopefully, at some time chewed or snorted it and ask: what&#039;s it like?<br /><br />Do you get any kind of oxy/perc type high from snorting it OR is it like eating a dilaudid...just a little relaxation and sleep but no real high.<br /><br />Appreciate any and all input.&nbsp; Mucho gracias, amigos!&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Pure methadone is where its at. Pills are not easily snorted or fixed. Too many binders, in fact, when I weighed my 10mg methadone pill, the total weight was 200mg so that means 190mg of inert crap. The stuff that Mseller has is some pretty good stuff. <br /><br />It&#039;s powerful that you have to make sure that its diluted properly. Don&#039;t use more than 30mg in 1ml of water. If you happen to miss a vein and the concentration was more than that, it takes the body a long time to absorb the concentrated methadone.<br /><br />you can sniff it but it probably burns a bit. But, i also bet you can smoke it. You can also put some in some juice and drink it. I know that it works better than swallowing pills. <br /><br />Also, the pure methadone is nice to have on hand if you don&#039;t have anything else. Its better than bupenorphine, thats for sure...<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that shooting the pure methadone is better than smack. (especially if you add ciclizone to it, you can get that at riteaid or amazon, its calle marazeen motion sickness pills. just crush up and wheel filter it or filter very well with cotton 5 or 6 times...<br /><br />Mseller is legit.. plus its cheap as hell...

				Thanks Chronicpain, you have explained better then me, just want to add smoking part.<br />Its hydrochloride, that mean with all drugs high Melting point temperature. Even I have try I can not estimate like somebody else because my tolenerance.<br />I think would be better to convert methadone hcl into freebase (92c MP) and in that case methadone wont be burnt away because MP.<br />Conversion can be done simple with sodium carbonate(washing soda). You can do washing soda from bicarb, heating bicarb in oven on 200c for 30min.<br /><br />I like a buzz. Its not a long (which do?) but long lasting is that what is most powerful. You have nice buzz, moderate and you are sorted for 24h.<br />we are all different, like different things. Someone who like methadone, he will like it and to I.V without binders and complex preparation.<br />Others, can be a great option when in opiate withdraw.

				It all depends on your tolerance. Most methadone clinics start everyone out at 30mg a day. They then move up from there. Go check out the narcotic conversion. With methadone, you will see 2 classes. chronic and acute. I would use the acute method. <br /><br />If you are opiate naive, then I would start my dose at 10mg and wait about an hour (if taken orally) it takes that long for it to hit your body. Many od&#039;s happen because the user will take Xmg&#039; not feel anything and 20 minutes later take more, then repeat. then it hits him all at once an hour later. Also adding benzos and alcohol are pretty risky with methadone. I would recommend not doing it. If you have to, keep your benzo intake to the bare minimum.<br /><br />Remember, methadone is a different animal. Just have to take extra precaution if you haven&#039;t taken it before.

				Man, I wish I weren&#039;t so experienced with methadone.&nbsp; But anyway, there are different kinds.&nbsp; My familiarity is with the koolaid you get at clinics, and the pills that prescribed for pain.&nbsp; The clinic juice is great if you are sick, takes about an 45min - 1hr to get well, and it&#039;s a nice feeling...it does seem that the longer you do opiates, the harder it is to kick them.&nbsp; I just cannot kick...but after you&#039;ve been on daily methadone awhile, you don&#039;t feel other drugs., and most keep going up higher and higher, but the same thing happens...and constipation becomes a serious problem.<br /><br />The pills, I find, are somewhat different, and I prefer them.&nbsp; The problem is, that you can fix them, and if you have a sort of needle fixation, it&#039;s hard to *not* do it,when you get the pills.&nbsp; But Idon&#039;t find much happens unless you are sick..and they do burn a bit...and no &#039;rush&#039;...<br /><br />I too, have been very interested in msellers methadone.&nbsp; Like others, I worry about the &#039;overseas&#039; aspect, for yanks.&nbsp; But it sounds good, and totally different from what I&#039;ve always been used to.&nbsp; And nothing but good reports from buyers...

				Ok, so last month I ran out of norco&#039;s with my prescription and couldn&#039;t get them fast enough on here, so I ended up at a methadone clinic.&nbsp; I told them I wanted to detox, but little did they know, I had no plans of sticking around past when I could get my script refilled.&nbsp; Anyways, what an experience... crazy place, hopefully never end up back there... the people are loony.<br /><br />Mind you, my tolerence was 7 - 8 norco 10/325&#039;s a day... so not very high on the opiate scale.<br /><br />But, they did start me at 30 mg and it was taken orally.&nbsp; It was like a pinkish liquid that you drank.&nbsp; 30mg and I had to go back to work, I felt the best I&#039;ve ever felt in years... I was happy, pain free, on top of the world, saying hi to everyone at work... nodded just a tad bit, but kept it under control, was really hard to focus and was a bit cross-eyed.<br /><br />The next day I went back and the upped my dose straight to 50mg.... AND HOOOOOLY SHIT!!!!&nbsp; I had to go back to work again, but this was very different.&nbsp; I was so fucked up that I was not happy... It was kinda shitty... I was nodding like a mad man, in the middle of a meeting with 2 other people talking, i don&#039;t think they noticed.&nbsp; I was cross-eyed like a mother fucker, dizzy, just generally jacked up.&nbsp; I had to eventually leave work and have a friend pick me up because I could not stay at work like that.&nbsp; I can keep the norco&#039;s under control no problem, in fact they help me converse and be social at work while being pain free.&nbsp; But 50mg of methadone is in-fucking-sane my friends.<br /><br />This was orally taken from the pink liquid like i said... what I don&#039;t know is if you can mix any powder methadone or methadone pill in with water and drink it... I wouldn&#039;t see why you couldn&#039;t though as long as you can get it to mix, which it sounds like someone above said you can mix it in distilled water for injecting... so why not take it orally.&nbsp; That&#039;s how the methadone clinic did it for everyone.<br /><br />Hope this helps... and I only went to that clinic twice and never again... the 50mg was a traumatizing experience... ;)

				Short answer: Methadone&#039;s bioavailability is 99% taken orally. Why -wouldn&#039;t- you take it orally?

				People want the rush.&nbsp; It&#039;s indefensible...like much of what we do...just you get frustrated, miss the feeling a good opiate gives you, and I&#039;ve heard others have same problem<br /><br />Methadone *does* feel good once you get used to it...for a few weeks...sometimes called &#039;the honeymoon period.&quot;&nbsp; But once that goes away, you often get lethargic, and like I said--constipated...seem to loose drive, and the tendency is to keep going higher, hoping you&#039;ll get &#039;happy&#039; again.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; Then you find out just how hard to kick that shit is...<br /><br />I suggest anybody interested in methadone, wanting to hear all sides, and get good information, go to opiophile.org.&nbsp; Great site, lots of good info.&nbsp; Both sides of everything, good spirited arguments.&nbsp; Great site.&nbsp; Several serious warnings about staying off of SR tho ... Didn&#039;t work for me ;)

				Methadone is something else I don&#039;t recommend using TOO frequently. Kicking it is REALLY hard to do. DT&#039;ing is excruciating. I had to watch someone close go through that. I take maybe 5-10mg orally every couple of weeks if it&#039;s available. Small doses spread out. Always feels exactly the same every time. Good 6-8 hour buzz, no doubt.<br /><br />But if you want horror stories, go find a methadone clinic. Most people on opioid replacement therapies stay on them because getting off is just too much. And then months turn into years..
