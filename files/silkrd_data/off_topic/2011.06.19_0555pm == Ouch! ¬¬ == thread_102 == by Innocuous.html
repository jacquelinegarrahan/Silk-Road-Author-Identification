				Thanks Modoki. On close inspection it appears an account was compromised, The market is going o be reset sometime tonight!<br /><br />Hang on to your orders folks, the bitcoin price on mtgox is getting reset tonight<br /><br />Taken from the mtgox support page:<br /><br />&quot;The bitcoin will be back to around 17.5$/BTC after we rollback all trades that have happened after the huge Bitcoin sale that happened on June 20th near 3:00am (JST).<br /><br />Service should be back by June 20th 10:00am (JST, 01:00am GMT) with all the trades reversed and accounts available.<br /><br />One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.<br /><br />Apart from this no account was compromised, and nothing was lost. Due to the large impact this had on the Bitcoin market, we will rollback every trade which happened since the big sale, and ensure this account is secure before opening access again.&quot;<br />

				I do hope everything will be ok ;)<br /><br />&quot;UPDATE REGARDING LEAKED ACCOUNT INFORMATIONS<br /><br />We will address this issue too and prevent logins from each users. Leaked information includes username, email and hashed password, which does not allow anyone to get to the actual password, should it be complex enough. If you used a simple password you will not be able to login on Mt.Gox until you change your password to something more secure. If you used the same password on different places, it is recommended to change it as soon as possible.&quot;<br /><br />All Accounts dumped, passwords hashed.<br /><br />Time to abandon mtgox.<br /><br />Tradekey is the way to go until they get screwed over too..<br /><br />I think SR needs to use tradekey for its btc to usd prices now.
