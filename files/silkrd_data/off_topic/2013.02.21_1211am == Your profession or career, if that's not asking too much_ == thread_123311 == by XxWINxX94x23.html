				For anyone who would like to respond, I&#039;m curious what you all &quot;do for a living&quot; in this materialized and capitalist world.<br /><br />Maybe for the sake of being anonymous, instead of your actual position like: &quot;Regional Manager of McDonalds in New York, NY,&quot; one could say, &quot;Management at a fast food establishment.&quot;<br /><br />Just curious to know what the nice people in this community contribute to the &quot;real world.&quot;<br /><br />Please don&#039;t flame me as a government agent though, if you don&#039;t want to contribute, don&#039;t respond!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Lets hear some professions&nbsp; :)<br />

				If I were a cop (and I used to be), and I wanted to know everything I could about Silk Road, I would start with this forum.&nbsp; I would profile every single user, and collect every little bit of information.&nbsp; <br /><br />Folks, if you respond to the OP, I have one piece of advice.&nbsp; Lie.&nbsp; Lie your asses off.&nbsp; If you&#039;re an investment banker, say you&#039;re a surfing instructor.&nbsp; If you collect Social Security, but really you make about $19,000 cashing in stolen credit card dumps, say you&#039;re an investment banker (it&#039;s kinda the same thing).&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem with half the threads on this sub-board is that they encourage the giving away of details that go back to you.&nbsp; In another thread, you can find a user&#039;s Xbox gamertag (I hope it&#039;s been removed by now).&nbsp; That&#039;s linked to a fucking home address and a goddamned CREDIT CARD!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />We&#039;re all friends here, most of us, but we&#039;re also most of us federal felons.&nbsp; Try to remember that when someone lights the campfire and starts singing Kum Bah Yah.<br /><br />And, before the negative karma starts pouring in, +1 to the OP for trying to foster a sense of community.&nbsp; We all need a sense of community.&nbsp; I think there should be way more community, and way less communes.&nbsp; Or, convents.&nbsp; The Catholic thing.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; We just gotta be a little careful.<br /><br />sleepy<br />TorChat: qsy3fzzvw6ug6wbi

				Well I guess there&#039;s no way to filter the real and untrue professions from this post but either way it will make for a variety of interesting responses.<br /><br />Personally, I work at and/or attend a college, the choice is yours, friends. Which one, what studies I pursue, or what I do there is for your creative minds to think about.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m a chemistry teacher that secretly supplies SuperTrips? Maybe I&#039;m a computer student that does temp work for TOR?<br /><br />Imagination is a beautiful thing.
