				I thought id start this thread to see if there are any other services out there that people can help provide.<br />While we are all together down here on the deep web, we might as well make the most of it.<br />I&#039;m thinking about services such as obtaining documents, passports drivers licenses and what not.<br />Perhaps for those interested in hacking you can post hacking packages etc.<br /><br />Please let me know what you think.<br /><br />

				It might simply be that electronics are being sold at a high price these days.&nbsp; I understand you are selling them for what they are, but in this current economic climate you should consider dropping the price, or give an idea about what you expect.<br />I give you an example, i used to know a guy who could get guns, brand new not used.&nbsp; Trouble is they were going for like 1500 quid for a handgun.<br />At the moment i would be prepared to buy one for 300 hundred.&nbsp; <br />Its nice to know what amount people need to save for, especially when right now your as skint as i am.

Most of the armory is a joke, as far as I know there are no people who want to truly arm themselves to defend their own. If so they would take the time to buy one legally or train to be armed with one. I can see that most are not interested in defense, just the offense which lead me to believe that most people on the armory forums just want to own a arm for power/entertainment.

				I totally understand what you are saying.<br />I am looking for a gun on the basis that here in the uk, you just cannot seem to get one unless you pay extortionate prices.<br />I believe that everyone has the right to defend themselves and they recently change the law here so that you can use any force that is necessary.<br />As for the electronics id certainly be interested in buying those scrambled sat phones you mentioned.

I can`t help but stress the fact that everyone`s reaching for a gun for so called &#039;defense&#039;. There are many arts and other melee weapons one can adopt to protect themselves, furthermore there is risk involved with handling a gun. If people refuse to accept an alternative to a gun then I will assume that they are either unwilling to try/lazy or just incapable of differentiating between defensive and offensive fighting. Yes by all means everyone has the right to defend themselves, but not by a degree that is set by a bunch of rednecks. If so the North Koreans and other nations have every right to build nuclear weapons to &#039;defend&#039; themselves. Who are we then to give an ultimatum or seize their weapons? Right?<br /><br />Sure you can inquire about them if you wish if that&#039;s what you mean.

If people are that keen to defend themselves, especially with a gun then they should by all means act on it and do it in the way that is fastest/best available to them. There is a reason no-one will sell you a handgun for 300 quid, the reason being there are other sources/markets that have more lucrative offers. You might as well go to a shooting range/get a licensed firearm. You can`t wait for such a low ball offer forever especially if you have a reason to well more secure.

They can only be opened if done in the right sequence and moves, its almost like a puzzle and only the receiver of the box will learn the passes. The most lenient box requires 2 moves to open, while the most difficult 75+. The box is geometric in design thus making it impossible for LE or other people to suspect it or open it. I also have book/can stashes, but highly recommend the wooden boxes. I can upload photos of them tomorrow, all of the series.
