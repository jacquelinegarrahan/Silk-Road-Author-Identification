				I tried some methylone off the road and it was considerably better than any &quot;molly&quot; or MDMA around here. Maybe it was just a fluke though?<br />What&#039;s everyone&#039;s opinion on these two? I&#039;m trying to figure out what would be more economical to purchase for reselling.<br />Also, what about dosage?

				Methylone is bk-MDMA.&nbsp; It is simply MDMA with a beta ketone.<br /><br />Some people prefer MDMA and some people prefer methylone.&nbsp; The MDMA roll lasts slightly longer.&nbsp; MDMA is more neurotoxic.&nbsp; You should not reuse MDMA for a long time after use.&nbsp; Methylone is speedier.&nbsp; MDMA is about twice as potent milligram for milligram.&nbsp; MDMA has more negative side effects.&nbsp; You can take higher doses of methylone than you can of MDMA. (it&#039;s a waste though)

				From what I understand, the same strength of high you get off MDMA can&#039;t be achieved from Methylone. But methylone comes close, and is cheaper, not as neurotoxic and the comedown is a bit harsher because the stimulant effects are stronger.

				Well TECHNICALLY, it&#039;s MDMC (3,4-MethyleneDioxy-n-MethylCathinone) but since that was given to another drug, they re-dubbed it bk-MDMA. <br />That said, I think they are two totally different drugs with different effects. Sure, some of the effects are comparable, but at the end of the day it&#039;s not fair to compare them side-by-side. I think the same could be said for MDMA and MDA. Both are similar, but their differences are where they really stand out. <br /><br />The drug Shulgin named MDMC: (**clearnet**) http://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?domain=pk&amp;id=110<br /><br />I think Jack N Hoff has the right idea here:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=203111.msg1460759#msg1460759">Quote from: Jack N Hoff on August 17, 2013, 10:40 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Some people prefer MDMA and some people prefer methylone.&nbsp; The MDMA roll lasts slightly longer.&nbsp; MDMA is more neurotoxic.&nbsp; You should not reuse MDMA for a long time after use.&nbsp; Methylone is speedier.&nbsp; MDMA is about twice as potent milligram for milligram.&nbsp; MDMA has more negative side effects.&nbsp; You can take higher doses of methylone than you can of MDMA.
