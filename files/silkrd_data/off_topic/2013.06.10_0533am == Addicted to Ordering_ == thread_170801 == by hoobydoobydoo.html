				I was just curious to know if anyone else here feels this way sometimes....<br /><br />I feel sad on the days when I am not expecting anything in the mail from SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />It almost makes me want to order stuff that I don&#039;t need just so I can feel the rush of waiting for the package to arrive and the excitement of receiving it in the mail.<br /><br />I have been on SR for a while and when the bitcoin bubble started blowing up and all of the sudden it was over $200 I had more money than I could spend so I started ordering like mad before it crashed.<br /><br />I don&#039;t personally do a lot of drugs, nor do I sell them; so I ended up building party stash of enviable proportions.&nbsp; Basically to the point where I know I will never even use most of it in my lifetime.&nbsp; There is almost nothing else that I could need.&nbsp; I just finished getting a couple more items lately to complete my collection (or maybe because I just wanted to do some more ordering), but I am slowly starting to realize that the sad truth that the run is over as there is no sensible reason to take any more risk ordering stuff that I don&#039;t need.<br /><br />And that makes me sad...<br /><br />Are there are any others out there like me or am I a unique kind of crazy?

				It&#039;s a good crazy. <br /><br /><br />Just make sure you conceal your stash properly. Having a lot of stash at any particular location is a liability that can be exposed under the weirdest circumstances. <br /><br />I remember a while ago, a friend of mine had a fire at his house. Nothing major. Just an upstairs bedroom. But having fireman and police there because of the fire turned into what amounts to a warrant-less search/discovery. Needless to say, it was quite the legal hassle.

				I cured my addiction of selling drugs with an addiction of shipping drugs.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad that I don&#039;t have an addiction to ordering drugs.&nbsp; I bet that would get pretty expensive rather fast.

				They do a sweeping check of the house when trying to figure out the cause of the fire. Since it appeared that the cause was electrical, they pretty much had free reign to look all about. Found his stash between rafters siting on fiberglass mat next to the pull down attic staircase. <br /><br />Best thing to do is keep stash somewhere that can withstand a fire are least likely to be looked at in the event of a fire, or tornado, of flood. Acts of God can turn into a God smack in an instant when we&#039;re talking about concealing a stash.

				Grow rooms are often found that way.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t keep a ballast away from water, plant grew up into an HID, lamb falls or other electrical problem that will cause a fire.&nbsp; Then they find the grow. :(

				I can agree with the addiction to SR. I have to be on it several times a day. I feel the same way about having orders on the way, but I always order small and use the items fairly quickly so I never have much in my stash. <br /><br />Even when I don&#039;t plan on buying I want to see the new listings, browse feedback., etc. I don&#039;t sell sell drugs anymore, for many years, and no plans on being a vendor, but I can imagine the rush of making up the stealth packs and seeing that they arrived via feedback.

				I don&#039;t order that much, but I&#039;m on all the time. I think I&#039;m just fascinated with the whole idea that this can go on and be reasonably safe. (I grew up in a very religious home and was very sheltered for a good part of my life). Also interested in Atlantis and BMR though I&#039;ve never ordered there.

				I was at first, until I had gotten everything I&#039;d been curious about. Now I do get a bit sad if I don&#039;t have anything coming in the mail so I like to review the odd sample.

				Yeah, recently self-diagnosed with this, there being no sane reason for my last order except &quot;hmm, let&#039;s give this a try.&quot; Which is pretty funny considering how long I went without and what sorts of lengths I went to acquire things from unreliable street vendors before SR. Now I&#039;m ordering stuff &quot;just because&quot;. <br /><br />Though it&#039;s an excitement vs. tension thing. I&#039;m glad when I have the package with nothing more on the way, because I can relax. I&#039;m in the (almost) no risk zone. Then I start window shopping again...<br /><br />It would be expensive but like most people I don&#039;t tend to make cadillac purchases while window shopping.

				:(<br /><br />I&#039;m cripplingly addicted to sales and good deals on drugs. I&#039;ve viewed from the first page, to the last page, every domestic listing, multiple times in the last few months (so I&#039;m not currently up to date on EVERYTHING). Prices are always changing, but slowly.<br /><br />And then an occasional foreigner will also sell me something at a great good deal. <br /><br /><br />
