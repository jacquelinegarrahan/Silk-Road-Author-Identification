				Just been looking through SR, and noticed that there is a massive difference between strains and qualities. For example; premium cocaine is sold at 20+&nbsp; btc&#039;s, when some, such as cocaine pink was at 6.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, how far do you all go for quality, is it worth it paying 3x as much for better many quality? Personally, I have never tried the highest quality stuff, and prefer to smoke as much as i can instead of one good smoke.<br /><br />Locker.

				Lol in answer to the OP; i tend to buy on value more than quality, but i only really buy weed. I like to have a stock of cheap sativa (like Swazibudbud888) and a regular standard indica aswell for those nights i just want to mong out and watch a film.<br /><br />&nbsp;Having said that i recently had some higher quality stuff and did appreciate the difference, just for me i think the increase in cost out weighs it =)

				Yea i think i agree with you actually lol. If im buying chemicals then i think i would go for quality, partly because i don&#039;t want the &#039;other&#039; ingredients, but with weed i think its a tad different.

In the first place, I know the value of good coke and weed and I can tell if a product is what I want according to the price and the feedback. You are not gonna get good coke for less then 100 a gram unless you buy a quantity from a good vendor. Weed goes for 20 bucks a gram here for killer shit. Sometimes higher<br /><br />You have to read between the lines in the feedback&#039;s. Some buyers will leave 5/5 for something they got high from that may not even effect you. Some vendors make up fake accounts and leave their selves stellar feedback. You have to try and find reviews in the forums and if you can find reviews from quality members then your better off.

				I used to drive 6+ hours to buy pounds of quality cannabis but overtime I have gained the grower&#039;s trust and now they send their runners to me. Honestly, it takes time to get to the quality stuff and people on SR should be thankful for the quality they are being offered&nbsp; ;)

Like for things like puff and hash I really don&#039;t care about it because I don&#039;t do it so if on the very rare occasion I buy it I&#039;m not fussed about quality, I don&#039;t like it very strong anyway because it spins me out. For things like Ketamine I will be pretty pissed if it&#039;s not decent but I&#039;ll buy middle of the road quality if I must. Meph isn&#039;t really a problem for me because I don&#039;t buy it anyway but it would piss me off if I was given crap stuff from someone else (you have to take a pride in your work lol). For Bing and MDMA/MDA though I will journey into Mordor and cast the ring into the fires of Mount Doom to get decent quality and I wont buy anything else because I just wouldn&#039;t want it.

				It depends on the drug, quality is pretty much everything for me.<br /><br />When it comes to coke, I don&#039;t mind it being a bit cut. But I&#039;d never touch any fucking street coke again, that shit was wack. But medium quality SR coke is still infinitely better than street coke so I don&#039;t mind doing that. You really can&#039;t beat the primo shit though. It&#039;s a fucking shame Noriega fucked off and scammed, he had the sickest coke. <br /><br />MDMA, I want the best of the best. Mainly cause I&#039;ve done it so much, I need the pure. If I drop 200mgs and it turns out to be some weak shit, that pisses me the fuck off. I need 200mg of the best shit to get me going these days, you know the shit that you can smell through the bag. <br /><br />Weed, I prefer medium/medium high quality. But the AAAA shit knocks my head off. I&#039;d still smoke it if I was offered but I&#039;d give up on socialising/doing anything altogether.

				Well in regards to the coke your referring to, the 7BTC coke was so bad that after half a gram I felt nothing but a bit numb and throw the rest in the bin, that&#039;s how bad it was. I would much rather have .2 good stuff than a gram of bad, if only for the sake of my nose membrane.

Even if you don&#039;t go with them make sure you are spending at least 20-25BTC for a single gram and around 50BTC for 2.5g. Those are the benchmark prices for good shit in my experience. If you pay less than that then it&#039;s just gunna be stepped all over. Good luck! :)
