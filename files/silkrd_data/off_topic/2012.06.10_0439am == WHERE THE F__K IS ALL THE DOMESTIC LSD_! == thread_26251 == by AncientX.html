				Never have experimented with any of the 2c- Family products. I&#039;ve heard lots of good things. The only thing that kind of keeps me from wanting to try it, is i hear it can take 2 - 3 hours to kick in...and thats just fucking retarded...

				I hate the 2Cs. 25i-NBOMe is the closest drug to LSD that I&#039;ve tried. It&#039;s missing that lovey feel and has a speedy come up but aside from that it&#039;s a pretty solid substitute.

Meanwhile, might I recommend 3Jane from Canada? It&#039;s close and I&#039;ve heard pretty good things about that vendor.
