				What sort of volume of money are you wishing to launder? That is what determines the method (I work in finance and can help).<br />

Although I was thinking maybe 2-3k USD a month, just a way for having a legal income to keep tax authorities at bay. Although potentially it could be up to 10-20k USD a month.

You could always buy some MoneyPaks, convert to bitcoins, tumble, and cash back out (or buy shit on SR). At 10-20k a month you&#039;d be talking about alot of moneypaks though. I&#039;m not sure how to cash that much out without suspicion.

				I was thinking about this the other day. If you have BTC you could convert to UKash (on here maybe?) to fund a bookmakers/casino online account. List of casinos/bookmaker - http://www.goonersguide.com/UKash_for_online_gambling.html/http://ca.advantagesportsbetting.com/betting-payment-options/ukash-sportsbooks.htm. Then withdraw via one of their payout options bank transfer, Western Union etc.<br /><br />You have the advantage that you can claim the income as gambling wins. Depending on your country that might be tax free.<br /><br />You might have to show the sites some sort of activity you might be able to get around that by betting both sides of a basketball/football game using the spreads. You&#039;d probably lose about 2-5% per bet. Then you could more easily withdraw.<br /><br />You&#039;d probably have to use quite a few mtgox/other btc converting sites if your cash isn&#039;t in the form of btc already.<br /><br />Hoped I helped.

				Multiple cash intensive businesses seems the best way, e.g. window cleaning firms, construction etc. I&#039;d imagine cash businesses that report high incomes would be suspicious as these business owners usually don&#039;t pay the bulk of their taxes...hence why starting multiple businesses with lower incomes would be preferable. <br /><br />In any case, I&#039;m not an expert and I would recommend seeking professional guidance from accountants/lawyers on how best to do it, perhaps this advice can even be exchanged anonymously.
