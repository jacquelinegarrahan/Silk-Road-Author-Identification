				So I am getting some Valium, need to stock up. Might pick up some ciggies too.<br /><br />What I like -<br />MDMA - Got 2g of this already<br />MDA<br />K<br />Bing - Already got 2 n half g on the way though but open to sampling others that can match 84% purity<br />Meph - Lol...don&#039;t need any more of that thanks. :P<br /><br />Anyway anyone got any other suggestions? I am open to to knew things but don&#039;t touch Smack, Meth, Crack and I&#039;m not overly into trips or LSD. <br /><br />Got 50BTC to spend and got quite a bit of wiggle room. <br /><br />YOUR THOUGHTS! <br />

I like it because it&#039;s like being zapped into cartoon-land and it has this special joy to it that brings out your inner child. Everything is interesting and everything is new and funny but it&#039;s very manageable because it lasts 45-60 minutes at the outside so you can adjust your dose to fit your needs (silliness or MASSIVE K HOLE!). It&#039;s also one of those magical drugs that go with anything. Goes great with MDMA, MDA Coke, with Meph (which are basically my big 4) and also on it&#039;s own. The best thing is the diversity of the effects. Like if you do a bit it&#039;s like a cross between being stoned (but not in a cannabis or opiate way) and pissed but very different at the same time but if you go into a K-hole then you are going to have a whole out of body experience. <br /><br />Loves the K....I&#039;m buying some K. Who&#039;s got the K these days?

BUT Dutchaanbod does have his shit locked in his cock sock.<br /><br />Baring I&#039;ve bought in the coca tea from Latin-Land and done the reduction, washed it so it was pure Dutchaanbod&#039;s Bing is the only thing that comes close. We got the product to around 95% (was ultra tacky though) and when comparing it to his when he states it&#039;s 84% he definitely isn&#039;t telling woppers. At the most it may be -4% and that&#039;s at the most. <br /><br />I don&#039;t openly push vendors unless they really are A+ but Dutch is someone I don&#039;t mind saying because he don&#039;t fuck about.

				Best cocaine I&#039;ve ever done I bought for like 50euro/gram, which I think was well worth it. Felt almost like speed, but then while feeling like the baddest motherfucker on the planet. Think I did like 2 weeks with the gram cause it was that potent.<br /><br />Also why all that Valium? What does it do? Isn&#039;t it just a relaxant/pain killer.. Who&#039;d want that :P

As I say I am a MASSIVE Bing snob (and I really mean with a capital M A S S I V E) and apart from when we have done the extraction and made it ourselves I have never had anything as good as that. And no I have tried none of the others, I don&#039;t feel the need to because I&#039;m happy with Dutchaan&#039;s product and most importantly his service that goes with it. Very on the ball and his packaging is great which is exactly what you want when you are ordering Bing through the mail. <br /><br />And 50 a gram wont get you that decent stuff mate, the fact you are saying that it felt almost like Speed is a telling sign that it&#039;s been chopped with amphetamine and even if it was decent at those prices you probably would have been riding high at 50-60% purity maximum. Pure Bing isn&#039;t meant to make you feel like a &quot;bad motherfucker&quot; either, it&#039;s meant to be an ultra-focused and calm high that isn&#039;t so much stimulating but essentially a focused euphoric buzz. If it was potent then it was possibly bashed with Meth. <br /><br />And the Valium is a hypnotic sedative lol, it&#039;s not a pain killer. I take them for insomnia because my cunt-flap doctor wont diagnose them for me.

				Xanax is hands down my favorite benzo.&nbsp; It has a much shorter half life than valium which is at like 20hrs if I remember correctly and xanax is 7-8hrs.&nbsp; It is a knock you on your ass benzo.&nbsp; If you are looking for a good high you need like 1-2mg if you don&#039;t have a tolerance to benzos.&nbsp; I really think it is the most euphoric of all the benzo&#039;s I&#039;ve taken but that list is also short with valium, klonopin, xanax, and grr cant remember the last.....<br /><br />Anyway I really suggest you at least give xanax a try.&nbsp; And damn I wish I could afford me some coke..you got my mouth watering!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />StuntBum

				I have to agree with StuntBum, I like klonopin and xanax, k-pins I take if I&#039;m doing something during the day, feeling good and relax and being able to function(plus the taste fucking amazing)<br />But Xanax.. that for popping a bar under your tongue and chilling out in the sofa or bed listing to some nice music. maybe even smoke some marihuana. <br />I also keep them near by when I go exploring in the psychedelic realm (although I have never had to take one)
