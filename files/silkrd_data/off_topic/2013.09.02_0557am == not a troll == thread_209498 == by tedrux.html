				has it not occured to any one that some people dont have the fucking cognitive capacity to make it in this world? i&#039;m one. im not trolling. i just need a helping hand. the more I talk the more you mock and if you payed attetion you who like to watch and sqawk , I never wanted to get into reason s. nembutal. heroin. malaria pills. i dont give a fuck. id prefer a painless method. FOR ALL YOUR DAMNED CRITISISM SEND ME SOME FUCKING MONEY OR SOME FUCKING SUPPLIES AND IF I SHOW UP AGAIN AFTER THAT FEEL FREE TO MOCK ME. I tried the psychedelics as suggested , my life went unchanged. the deal was try that first and then youd help me. where is my help now that I still am imploring you for it?

				He&#039;d fuck it up and end up skin popping it. I guarantee you. But yea, that&#039;d be my personal suicide method. That or a trip to Dignitas in Switzerland. However, it&#039;d have to be in extreme circumstances as life&#039;s far too much of a laugh.<br /><br />I know some guy who tried to kill himself, he had a massive heroin habit though. So he decided to do a three gram hit but cldn&#039;t fit it all in the needle. FAIL. He was proper embarrassed when he came back still alive after telling everyone dramatically he was off to kill himself. Arf arf arf.

				the thing being if I don&#039;t then I owe you and I officially give the entirety of SR the right to black list me just on basis of my not being trustworthy. if I&#039;m the attention whore you think I am , then even if I change accounts eventually I would scream and cry and say &quot;it is I , ted rux&quot; cause thats what attention whores do.at that point I&#039;d owe you back all your money and be black listed from SR. that or at the very least have to shut up about suicide and &quot;drama&quot; and such.&nbsp; so is that a deal?

These weekly &#039;I want to commit suicide, give me money to do it because I&#039;m too much of a spaz to jump off a tall building/ run out in front of a train&#039; threads are beyond tiresome. <br /><br />No-one here&#039;s going to give you the money to buy drugs to kill yourself. <br /><br />Why? because we like spending our hard earned money on our own drugs for ourselves. <br /><br />But there&#039;s the moral issue too. Someone posted on here once something like, &quot;How many people wish they hadn&#039;t done it when the rope&#039;s around their neck and they&#039;ve kicked away the chair?&quot;. Only you should be held responsible if it ends up being an epic fuck up and you end up disabled or needing a new kidney or something, not us. Suicide is traditionally a very private decision and people tend to put their affairs in order then go and quietly do it with minimum fuss rather than whining about it for months on end on an internet message board. <br /><br />It&#039;s clear these late-night threads are a cry for attention and you&#039;re not really suicidal because if you were you&#039;d have done it long ago and we&#039;d be none the wiser. I bet you&#039;re the sort of person who threatens to kill yourself in real life when you don&#039;t get your own way to guilt trip people and now everyone around you just rolls their eyes, thinking &quot;here we go again&quot;.<br /><br />And now here on Silk Road it&#039;s the same scenario. We have all been through this over and over with you, Teddy, given you money to trip and told you free ways of killing yourself. If you really wanted to do it you&#039;d find a way and you wouldn&#039;t give a shit if it was painless or not because in no time at all the pain would be over. <br /><br />No-one cares that you feel unable to function in this world. Especially since you told Murderface that you don&#039;t give a shit that he&#039;s homeless when YOU have a home and in a nice area by the sound of things. <br /><br />Anyway you want attention and I&#039;m giving you it, but I reserve the right to tease you a little while I do. <br /><br />
