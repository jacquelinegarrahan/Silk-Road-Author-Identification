				Not my first post, but I somehow felt like making an alt.<br /><br />My understanding is that hash oil is edible and really strong, although not necessarily intended for eating primarily.<br /><br />As an alternative to various treats that might look suspicious, could you mix hash oil into, for example, a bottle of olive oil, and then when you wanted to partake just put a bit of said olive oil onto some garlic bread?<br /><br />Sorry if this is stupid, but I&#039;m wracking my brains trying to think of a foolproof way to keep a completely inconspicuous source of THC.

				It won&#039;t work. Most of the THC in the plant matter isn&#039;t actually THC but Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), which is active but not psychoactive. It does have antiinflammatory and neuroprotective effects but won&#039;t get you high.<br />However, THCA is unstable will decarboxylate into THC over time. The decarboxylation process takes place rapidly at temperatures of 106°C or higher. If you don&#039;t have the equipment to heat your oil to just above 106°C reliably and carefully (some cannabinoids begin to evaporate at about 180°C IIRC), you can heat the oil by mixing it with butter or any kind of oil, putting the mixture into a container made of metal or heat resistant glass and putting the container into boiling water. The temperature will only reach close to 100°C but that&#039;s enough to speed up the decarboxylation process. Use a thermometer to check the temperature of your oil mixture and once it has reached close to 100°C, maintain the temperature for 20-30 minutes and the decarboxylation should be complete. You can use the mixture to make brownies or muffins or almost any kind of food. Just don&#039;t heat it over 180°C or you&#039;ll lose cannabinoids. I like to mix a tablespoon of hash butter into a cup of hot chocolate. Tastes amazing and gets me super high for five hours :D

I was actually thinking primarily about this as a way to get some stuff past the truffle-sniffing pigs at the border, but on further thought I&#039;d probably never have the balls to try it anyway, and for all I know the hash oil would not visibly blend in with the other oil, having never seen it.<br /><br />If I had a little button to push that would instantly kill all the social conservatives and power-mongers in the world that make us risk our freedom just to experience a little more of life I wouldn&#039;t even hesitate.
