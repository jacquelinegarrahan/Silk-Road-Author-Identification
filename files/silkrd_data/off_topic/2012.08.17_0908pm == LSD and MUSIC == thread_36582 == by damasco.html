				<br />Hi brothers and sisters. I&#039;m just bored of talking about good and bad quality of drugs and its price in bitcoinz or other fucking ways. Here I want to bless Silk Road. We Are One and we MUST enjoy and share our feelings, we are a family now. So what music do you love to feel when you&#039;re high???? I&#039;ll let you know mine, but let me know yours !&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;)

				Mars Volta always blow my mind... they know how to fuck your mind.<br /><br />Also, a Noggy artist called Susanne Sundf√∏r released an album called The Silicone Veil this year... The production is meant for acid, I&#039;m convinced of it... and she&#039;s just such a vocal talent as well as a good musician, refreshing in these days of samey female artists, butchering their scales on the radio.<br /><br />Been meaning to get my Floyd on during my next trip... I remember having such awesome experiences with weed and Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here... I&#039;m sure I wouldn&#039;t mind when high on acid.

				indian classical on LSD is amazing.&nbsp; i am a tabla fan, in particular, so i&#039;d find some ragas performed by Zakir Hussain.&nbsp; Ali Akbar Khan on the sarod is always great, or of course, Ravi Shankar on sitar.

				I&#039;m not sure how this band sounds on LSD but...<br /><br />I was really, really bummed out tonight. And listening to the decemberists made me feel better. They are an amazing band.<br /><br />The crane wife, and her majesty, and my mood is uplifted a little bit, somehow... not sure how, it&#039;s not really all that uplifting of music lyrically, and it&#039;s musically very very mellow, but it did.<br /><br />I highly recommend.

				I like listening to Shpongle on acid. Also Carbon Based Lifeforms, Orbital, Pink Floyd and the Peaking Goddess Collective, among others. <br /><br />If you&#039;re into electronic trance type music, this (clearnet) site is great. Free and legal: http://www.ektoplazm.com/

				1. 15 or so years ago(Holy shit that&#039;s just surreal saying) I ate some paper and happened to turn on Lenny Kravit&#039;s &quot;What The Fuck Are We Saying&quot;. From the beginning of the song till the the point at around 3:30 into the song when it gets a bit weird, I went from mildly tripping to shit-balls-raining-rainbow-bubbles-Blasted! I&#039;ve never had such a visual transformation based solely through music before that or since. Oddly enough, I&#039;ve never listened to it while tripping since then. <br /><br />2. Recently I learned that crickets and nature in general make a pretty sick DJ combination with Electronic Music. Happened to be listening to Fatboy Slim&#039;s Xmas, Japan, and Vegas mixes and nature was crushing it in conjunction with the music. Pretty insane.

				Interesting observation about nature, same happened with me - we were on the seaside with quite loud noise of the waves crashing on the rocks but when I made the link in my head to combine the sound of the waves with the sound of the music we were listening to, the trip just went magical. The music that was playing when this happened was Royksopp - True to Life (from their Junior album). That album is generally good for any kind of tripping, it&#039;s simply out of this world, check it out!
