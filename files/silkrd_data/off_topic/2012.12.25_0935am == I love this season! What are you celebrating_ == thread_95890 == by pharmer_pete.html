				I live in the western hemisphere, and I love the holiday season.&nbsp; For me it&#039;s Christmas, while others have Hannukah, Winter Solstice, Seinfeld has Festivus, whatever tickles your fancy. All of these things shape how we interact with the ones around us. Strangers, friends, family members. People are a little more charitable, a smile comes easier, we&#039;re a bit more tolerant over things that really don&#039;t matter in the big picture.<br /><br />Tragedies still happen, and they always will. I can&#039;t explain them so I don&#039;t try and I wish others wouldn&#039;t bother. Despite the bad things, I like to see humanity setting the bar as high as we can and then clearing it. I hope we never stop trying.&nbsp; Whatever you are celebrating this season, give yourself over to it with trust and faith.&nbsp; Be kind to yourself, and good to others.&nbsp; Let that propel us as far into the new year as it possibly can.<br /><br />To my fellow travelers on the Silk Road, thank you for being here. Peace to the world on this night.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yup, just had to be one in there somewhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pay no attention to the PC troll... taking a global look at things, it is in fact the &quot;holiday season&quot; friends.&nbsp; Hannukah ran from the 8-16th. Yalda on the 21st. Winter Solstice on the 21/22nd.&nbsp; Christmas Adam on the 23rd (I kid you not). Christmas Eve on the 24th. Christmas on the 25th. Boxing Day for some, Kwanzaa for others, both on the 26th (one having nothing to do with the other). St Stephens Day on the 26th. New Year&#039;s Eve and Hogmanay on the 31st.&nbsp; Japan just finished celebrating the Emperor&#039;s Birthday. Go out to Roppongi Hills in Tokyo right now, and you&#039;d see Christmas lights. If someone needs the worldwide list, I suggest wikipedia.<br /><br />It&#039;s a beautiful time of year.&nbsp; Enjoy it however you can.
