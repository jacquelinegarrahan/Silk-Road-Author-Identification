				I usually hire a guy to collect for me.&nbsp; He gets to keep 20% of whatever he can get out of them. <br />Then your conscience clear and other people are more angry at that guy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Make up some story about the collector is really your supplier and he is pissed off and wants his money now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Watch the money appear out of fucking thin air . .&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s amazing how they turn into David Copperfield and make money appear .

				Hire on some trusted help. Or take the loss now and don&#039;t deal with people who can&#039;t pay to play in the future. Unfortunately those are your only two options.<br />At the end of the day, you are a drug dealer. You have to take care of your interests because nobody else will. If you don&#039;t then your peers and clients will take your interests and leave you fucked in a heartbeat. This is something to learn early and fast in the game.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t tell, I vote for hiring the help. Don&#039;t take getting pissed on..<br /><br />Good luck man&nbsp;

				Only $700? Just forget about it and move on. You learned a lesson for the low price of $700. Never give drugs to people on credit. There is an old adage that says &quot;Nobody wants to pay today for yesterday&#039;s drugs&quot;.

				I once had a dealer sell me fake coke, I through a 1kg bomb of acetone peroxide into his bedroom window, sadly he was never able to pay me back... but is usually working out very well. Just be careful to not hit any speedbumps well driving with that stuff. You can also one pot cook it in a gas tank if the weather is good and let that stuff sit overnight under some ones car and once they try drive of&nbsp; their entire car will blow, especially if they have a full tank of gas. <br /><br />Lots of easy way to scare money out of people and stay anonymous, just make sure they dont have your real name or phone number and your 100% safe.

Never let people owe you money. Even people who you consider friends. &quot;Friends&quot; are quick to disappear over $50 or $100. It&#039;s very depressing and disappointing when people you&#039;ve known for years fuck off because they owe you $100. I used to be owed ~$2,700, then I cut the crap and got on to people. Most people paid me back, but I still have $900 owed to me. I&#039;ve done all I can to get the money back from those people - They won&#039;t pay though. Some of those people I did massive favours for too... Driving to their place in the middle of the night because they were too wasted to drive, and never saw the money from that. It pisses me off how low some people are, but you can&#039;t really do much. If they don&#039;t like you, they could always report you as a drug dealer, and that&#039;s why I haven&#039;t gone further with debt collection. it&#039;s not really worth the risk.<br /><br />At the end of the day,I&#039;m the one with the drugs. If they ever need drugs and no one else has any, they&#039;ll come back to me. People have done this to me, but I make them pay all their previous debt owed to me, then they can pay double what anyone else would pay. Fuck them. They are desperate and will pay the price.

Avoid people who will take an eternity to pay, if they ever do. I also hate asking for money. I make most people pay upfront now. If they don&#039;t, I charge them at least an extra 15%. This encourages them to ay upfront and I think it is fair.
