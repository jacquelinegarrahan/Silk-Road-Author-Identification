				I&#039;ve been shooting dilaudid (and occasionally oxy&#039;s when they are not available) for a little over 8 years now.&nbsp; I learned to do it online and for long time i was supplied by my doctor so i have never shot up with anyone else or really even discussed it much with anyone else.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really get hooked on it i go through short one or two day binges and then stop for awhile.&nbsp; I have snorted heroin a few times in my past but that was my only experience really with heroin.&nbsp; I was thinking about trying to shoot heroin for the experience and&nbsp; I was wondering what the differences were between shooting the two different opiates.&nbsp; Do you prefer heroin or pharms and why?&nbsp; I&#039;ve also noticed alot of heroin bangers using language like booting and chasing and was wondering what they meant.&nbsp; Any discussion on this would be great thank you :)

				I dont know .Back in the day i shot dilaudid aswell.ive smoked and snorted heroin .I would not recomend shooting it.My Mom was a heroin addict,and it was nothing pretty. snorting and smoking was hard enough to quit.Think about it good and hard man. I hate too see anyone go down the wrong road and get lost.
