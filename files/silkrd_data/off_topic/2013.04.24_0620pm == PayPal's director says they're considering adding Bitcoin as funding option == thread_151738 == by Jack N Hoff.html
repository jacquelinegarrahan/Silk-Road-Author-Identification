				David Marcus, president of EBay Inc.&#039;s PayPal unit was on Bloomberg today where he said, &quot;and I think here, for us at PayPapl, it&#039;s just a question of whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal&#039;s funding instrument or not, and we&#039;re kind of thinking about it right now.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying PayPal is good.&nbsp; I hate PayPal.&nbsp; I am saying this would allow people to spend Bitcoins on eBay and anywhere else that accepts PayPal.&nbsp; It would cause Bitcoins to go more mainstream and cause the price to rise.

				i think this would be great, it would make it much easier to get bitcoins if&nbsp; Paypal started using them, <br />Paypal are a trustworthy&nbsp; company.
