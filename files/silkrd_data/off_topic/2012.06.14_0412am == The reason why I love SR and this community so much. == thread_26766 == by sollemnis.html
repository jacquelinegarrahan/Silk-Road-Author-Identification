				For starters, we&#039;re all here together, working together and helping each other help. We have brilliant mods such as Lim, who&#039;s products are the don and he&#039;s always giving out free sample! Such a cool guy.<br /><br />Secondly, I rarely see arguments here, except of course with Mr Dank, but I&#039;m sure you all agree with me its banter. Nobody takes him seriously.<br /><br />Honestly whenever I need advice I get it from you guys! I&#039;m a laid back guy, try to help out where I can, try to point people in the right direction as to what drugs to use and what doses are best. I&#039;ve learned so much from this community! Before joining SR, I was settling for street crap... now I get&nbsp; CLEAN drugs that are always on weight and very well packaged.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always loved to discuss my drug experiences are hearing about others, here I&#039;ve read a ton of reports! I now know (from this community) how to keep myself safe from LE and the best to get BTC. I&#039;ve messaged a ton of people about things I&#039;m unsure about, always received an honest and helpful answer.<br /><br />This community is HUGE, what is it? 20,000 members? I have a few people on here I&#039;d call friends, always help me out and comfort me.<br /><br />Before SR I was a little down about myself, mainly due to my upbringing (ANTI - DRUGS) sort of family. I had to hide my drug use back as a teen, would have been grounded for months just for using a bit of Coke&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; When I moved in on my own I had total freedom, but my friends mainly just smoke weed, not my thing really... use it with MD every now an then but that&#039;s about it. It comforts me that on here people are in the same boat as me, we use drugs from time-time and it comforts me knowing others are enjoying what I am.<br /><br />Lastly, a BIG thanks to DPR, we represent freedom, the right to put substances in to our bodies. Why are drugs illegal? Because the media hype about under-ages kids taking an OD... here we are intelligent enough to know how to dose, if shit hits the fan there&#039;s always somewhere here to advise you what to do. I&#039;ve never known such a big community where all the users are friendly. - Obviously we get the odd troll - but lets face it they&#039;re ignored.<br /><br />We are the new generation, fuck the street dealers mixing their drugs up with harmful stuff - clean drugs, tight community, helpful guides and good honest people. <br /><br />I LOVE SR.

				i find if i smoke ganj during or straight after a coke session i get proper they&#039;re coming to get me paranoid. so now i leave it if i know i&#039;m going to be binging, and for a day or 2 afterwards, depending on how expensive the session was

				i think it&#039;s probably impossible to get paranoid on MD, no matter what you do while you&#039;re rolling. and yeah - that&#039;s the exact reason why i smoke on MD, brings you up more. on occasion a spliff the next morning/early afternoon has brought me back up as well :)
