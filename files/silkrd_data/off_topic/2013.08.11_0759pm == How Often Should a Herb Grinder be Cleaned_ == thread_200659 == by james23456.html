				As the title says - how often? I have a 2-part grinder, which I&#039;ve had for a few months now, and it is coated in resin on the inside, as well as some along the lip on the outside, making it difficult sometimes to twist the grinder. I cannot really make use of the resin, as I don&#039;t have one of those fancy grinders with kief catchers in them. <br /><br />So I was just wondering how often people clean theirs?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I used to use something somewhat sharp and scrape up the resins to smoke myself, only reason I ever really cleaned out my grinder when I used them, but that was before I started smoking only high end greens and you really dont want to grind that imo, I like to use either little clippers or lightly pick apart with my fingers but I also dont smoke nearly as much as I used to due to lack of a job and funds for mids etc. I can sure as hell make a g of some decent stuff last a week though now which is better than 1/4 of mids or 1/8 of decent bud every week :). Most people just dont realize you can only get so high off marijuana the synthetic shit tho doesnt seem to have a cap and that is why I wont touch them anymore

				I&#039;ve had my keif grinder for about 9 months now and I&#039;ve never cleaned it. The only part of it that gets cleaned is the keif catcher whenever I want to smoke some keif, that&#039;s about it.

				<br />I would go along the lines of never because when it does come time to empty it out... man is it a treat!

				I&#039;ve had my kief grinder for a couple years now. I love it.<br /><br />I think the screen could use a good cleaning though... It seems like it doesnt catch as much kief, maybe the screen is a little clogged? But then again maybe I just smoke lesser quality weed and dont smoke as much as i used too...<br /><br />Either way, I think I&#039;m gonna use an air duster or soak it in Iso for a day or two

				Well i wouldnt say never then whats the point in saving the keef. Clean it out on special occasions such as 4/20. And throw it on top of sum green and you know the rest... Toke up!

				If I had a Kief catcher in my grinder, I would certainly do that, however I have only a two-part grinder without a kief catcher, so it&#039;s just a case of scraping what I can out of it. I&#039;m actually going to buy a grinder cleaner spray, so I can properly clean it. It has so much resin around the outside, that it&#039;s hard to twist it.
