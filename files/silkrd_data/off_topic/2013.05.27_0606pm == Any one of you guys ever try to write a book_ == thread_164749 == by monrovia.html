				To give a synopsis of the story in one sentence, &quot;It&#039;s about a young, white collar suburban college graduate who&#039;s addiction to heroin led him up the ranks of (city edited to protect myself)&#039;s criminal underworld, but not without facing do or die situations, pivotal decisions, remarkable characters, and his conscience which follows him through it all.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m still in the brainstorming process. I&#039;m trying to get the bare bones of the storyline in place, chapter by chapter, until I start actually writing the first draft. I might post some updates and excerpts so I can can some encouragement/criticism from the community, as any and all of it would be welcome. I&#039;m desperate to to perform a creative art, and with my firsthand knowledge, along with the research that I can do, this has potential to be a very realistic crime novel. My bigger challenge will be making the plot as entertaining as possible. <br /><br />The main character is loosely based off me, the situations presented throughout the book will all be influenced by my own life and things that I&#039;ve seen other people have to deal with, as well as some complete fiction just for the purpose of entertainment. <br /><br />Basically a young, average man who makes a little more money than the average man his age has a well hidden secret(which I&#039;ve already given away.) He eventually gets lucky and is faced with an opportunity to move up the dope ladder in a major US city. He takes it, and things start to go really well. His customer base is expanding, he&#039;s making money/doing dope for free, and gaining the trust and respect of his new group of friends. Throughout the book, he endures conflicts with police, associates, rival dealers, his family, and himself. I haven&#039;t decided yet, but I have an Idea for a hell of an ending. <br /><br />Anyway, comment if you&#039;d like. I wanna hear if you think I&#039;m a fuckin idiot or if you think I might be able to catch the interest of a few people with this idea if I do things right. I don&#039;t really mind if I get all the way through this and never get published. This is a personal project that I&#039;m doing for personal reasons, and I could give a fuck whether people find it entertaining or nite, although it would be a nice bonus :)

				Good luck man! Sounds promising :)<br />Should you ever have problems with writer&#039;s block, try microdosing alkylated 2Cs (2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-P). They are incredible creativity boosters :D

Anyhow this sounds like a kick ass story line actually interested me just by reading it. It&#039;s a herione addict keeping a secret and what interest me is that its your average run of the mill middle class kid. Just goes to show you you don&#039;t ever know what happens behind closed doors. If I knew how to +1 I&#039;d do it, You&#039;ve got a firm stable dream and story line here I suggest you chase it, but ease up on the herione don&#039;t chase that heh. To each is own of course no disrespect intended! I&#039;d like to keep updated on this. Hell it even sounds like an awesome tv show &lt;3 .<br /><br />TLDR: I don&#039;t always write super long paragraphs...but when I do you can bet your sweet ass it&#039;s because I felt the need to give you the feedback of how awesome it sounded! <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve written a bit: novels, short stories, poems, articles, scripts...pretty much a little bit of everything at some point. I particularly enjoy writing fiction, though.<br /><br />Your idea is interesting and one of the best writing quotes I can recall is to &quot;write what you know&quot; and it sounds like that&#039;s what you are doing. <br /><br />I encourage you to tackle it if that&#039;s what you enjoy -- it may not make you much (or any) money but life should be about doing what makes you feel good. So please write away and post as much of it as you want. I for one would be happy to read and give my opinions regarding it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Thanks for the support guys. I have a clearnet site dedicated to the book and blogs that I occasionally right. For obvious reasons, I&#039;m not going to broadcast it on here, but if you are a reputable member and are interested in the link, PM me and I&#039;ll send it to you. Cheers!

				It&#039;s one of my dreams, I&#039;ve been picking away at it for years now. I wish you good luck and would certainly read your novel :)

				I love to write. I have so many ideas and stories in my head and can&#039;t get them out fast enough. I&#039;ve always been that way.<br />Sounds like a wicked book. Would love to read it (even in it&#039;s rough form) and totally would love to see it get eventually published or produced into a movie.<br /><br />subbing.<br /><br />excited for you!

				I haven&#039;t ever decided to attempt any piece of recreational literature, however I do frequently consider various core ideas of story-lines mainly pertaining to either an anarchistic revolution, or the systematic removal of things I personally find annoying on what could be considered a smaller scale of thought in a realistic manner. <br /><br />Good luck with your endeavors, it sounds as though it could be a good form of introspective literature. I think many people fail to realise that no matter how disassociated from a person&#039;s perceived life anything they publish may be, that the very ideas that led to their writing prove that some amount of thought went into it and it essentially reflects who they are in a way.
