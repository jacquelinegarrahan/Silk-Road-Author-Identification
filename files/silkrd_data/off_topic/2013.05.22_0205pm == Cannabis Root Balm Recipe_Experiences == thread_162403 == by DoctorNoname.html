				Hi, I found this on clearnet a while ago and have found it to be awesome. Every grower should be making this stuff even if it is just to give it to any elderly people they know because it is great for arthritis and the general aching that comes with age.<br /><br />So to make it just take all the parts of the cannabis plant you aren&#039;t using, the fan leaves(no resin necessary), stems and most importantly the roots. Just boil it all for 12 hours with coconut oil constantly keeping it topped up with water just like you would make cannabutter. Then you just follow the same filtering, cooling and separating as you would with cannabutter and voila!<br /><br />I like to boil off any residual water and decarboxylate the cream by heating it to around 115c for 20-30 minutes, just be careful as it will spit a lot. I use a jam/candy making thermometer to monitor the temperature whilst doing this.<br /><br />Because people grow in different ways my general guide is around 600-1000ml coconut oil per 600w of lighting.<br /><br />If you are a hydro or aero grower like me just remove as much non-root material as possible but soil growers are going to need to shower off as much of the soil/coco as you can. Remember this is going to be boiled and filtered so it&#039;s not the end of the world if some ends up in there.<br /><br />To improve your final product you can add some emu oil to increase penetration and a dash of hemp oil to make it more creamy at room temperature.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post some more topical recipes when I get a chance, feel free to share any ideas and/or experiences<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor<br /><br />

				So, time for some slightly more advanced adaptations of the root balm:<br /><br />For Atopic Dermatitis:<br />50% Root balm<br />50% Shea butter<br />a few quills of cinnamon<br />a small amount of myrrh gum(0.5%)<br />A few drops of cinnamon leaf oil<br />Seaweed(as much as possible and a good variety but simple noori will do)<br /><br />You can either throw all the ingredients in the pot with the roots et al or you can add the other ingredients to a pure coconut oil root balm.<br /><br />This works really well for dry, damaged skin, sunburn, eczema, atopic dermatitis, cuts, bruises and just about everything else on the surface of the skin. Mrs Doc has fairly sensitive atopic dermatitis and this is far more effective than anything the NHS can or will give her, to provide some context she never smokes cannabis and very rarely eats it but the cream she loves.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the well read amongst you will notice that it is similar to the recipe for the Holy Anointing Oil from Exodus, it seems to be a very effective concoction and the &#039;cassia&#039; referred to never specifies the part of the plant used, whilst the buds can be made into very effective topical applications none are as good as the ones made from roots.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Another great use of a base root balm is to fill 00 gel caps with it, it seems to have all the medicinal/CBD effects without creating any associated &#039;high&#039;.<br /><br />It can be used in this fashion like a painkiller(like paracetamol/Tylenol), anti-inflammatory(like ibuprofen), mood stabiliser, anti-depressant and replace a whole host of other medications. Dosing may take more than one cap but it is certainly effective.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				+1<br /><br />This is great information, Doc!<br /><br />I&#039;d also be really interested in your Cannabutter method, if that&#039;s not giving away too many of your trade secrets! ;)<br /><br />Cheers!

				Thanks! I don&#039;t really have any trade secrets, I&#039;m pretty open about the process of everything I do<br /><br />Personally I use concentrate to make butter so I just melt it in to regular butter, coconut oil or cocoa butter and decarboxylate it depending on the recipe.<br /><br />The classic method for making cannabutter is simply boiling your plant material in butter for 6-12 hours and then seiving the cannabis out, allowing it to cool and then you should be left with a disc of cannabutter sat on top of some water. Just remove this disk and cook it very gently until there is no more water left in it, just keep the temperature low and cook until it stops spitting. It can then be stored for as long as you need in the freezer.<br /><br />One good tip if you are making large amounts is to reboil the cannabis in water to reclaim any additional butter/oil left over. A coffee cafetiere can also be used to hold the plant matter down and allow the fats to rise to the surface.<br /><br />In terms of ratio of cannabis to butter it depends on what you are working with but you roughly want 0.5g of bud per dose of butter.<br /><br />Hope that answers your questions<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Just cross-posting this from my review thread as it pertains to the root balm. When he says he was cynical I told him he didn&#039;t have to pay for the balm if it didn&#039;t help:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131780.msg1167532#msg1167532">Quote from: Mant0n on May 27, 2013, 05:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I recently got some of The Doc&#039;s balm, and also a little bit of his honeycomb to try. These are my experiences...<br /><br />Delivery was next day, and quite simply the stealthiest packaging I have had from any SR vendor. I bought the balm after a long discussion with Doc in which he reassured cynical moi that it would work....<br /><br />I used the balm on my wrists, which have severe arthritis. I can&#039;t take normal NSAIDs, and paracetamol is only effective at doses &gt;1g. It is however a hepatotoxic drug, so consistent high dosing of paracetamol is undesirable as well as still being only 80% effective. <br /><br />The balm has a reasonably firm texture, and greeny-brown colour. There is a slight smell to it, but once applied, this is not noticeable. The skin is not coloured by it. It spreads easily and was no problem to apply.<br /><br />The effect of the balm was obviously not immediate. It took about 20 mins to demonstrate an effect, and I had to apply slightly more than the initial thin layer I rubbed on for the effect to be noticeable. I am delighted to say that it&#039;s painkilling effects were a great relief to me. Although I still needed a little paracetamol, the amount was back to normal doses, and gave 100% relief. I even manged to get out into the garden and spend a couple of hours working there - something I haven&#039;t been able to do for a while due to the arthritis. Normally when I have used my wrists for some physical work like this, they flare up, and I spend the next day or two regretting it. Not so this time, and I can only attribute this to the balm.<br /><br />I detected no systemic effects from the balm - just the localised painkilling effects where it had been applied.<br /><br />So Doc, thank you from the bottom of my heart - you have really helped me.<br /><br />The honeycomb is incredible stuff. I used a little (and I am talking about a crumb here - 2mm x 2mm x 1mm) which I put in a vape with a herb load which was mostly spent (my vape isn&#039;t the best for oils/waxes etc). A couple of really clean hits later, and I was flying. Really clean heady effect (although I tend to find that generally with vaping compared to smoking), and very little couchlock. I liked it enormously.<br /><br />I have already bought more of the balm, and intend to buy more honeycomb as soon as I get some more btc!<br /><br />So all in all, a 10/10 from me for DoctorNoname<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It helped.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Yeah, I stumbled across a study which said that dogs with atopic dermatitis had more CB2 receptors in their skin. It seems that modulating the receptors plays a huge role in containing atopic dermatitis and other similar conditions. At the very least Shea butter is pretty good for dry skin so you can&#039;t really go wrong.<br /><br />Although the balm is great for pain and inflammation it seems that people with atopic dermatitis find it the most useful as it can treat it in a way that nothing else even comes close to. Mrs Doc has one thing the &#039;proper&#039; doctors prescribe her that doesn&#039;t burn her skin but even that isn&#039;t anywhere near as effective as my balm. Fortunately she doesn&#039;t smoke so it&#039;s the only part of my stash she dips in to<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I&#039;m doing a bit of shameless whoring so I thought I would put this here:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(Please feel free to use this for your own notes or post it publicly!)<br /><br />We purchased a sample of the CBD capsules and the balm from doctornoname. My partner suffers intermittent muscular lower back pain which several times in the past has blown out and left her unable to move. It&#039;s a lifelong back problem and a frequent source of nagging pain. In her particular case the balm offered mild relief when the pain would begin to flare up and pinch. However, the capsules offered a much more thorough relief and she was able to go about her day pain free. Usually the first day offered mild relief while the second day of taking the pills led to much more relief and freedom from pain and discomfort. The pills did have a slightly stoney couchlocked side effect but that went away after two or three days of use, I guess her tolerance for the stoneyness increased but the pain relief remained excellent.<br /><br />We are both cycle commuters, I cycle about 20 miles a day to and from work. I have a constant dull swollen discomfort in one knee which can flare up on bike rides into a moderately painful condition. Sitting down for long periods without being able to stretch my legs (long drives, cinema) can leave me in a fair amount of pain. I rubbed the balm (or as I like to call it, the weed pesto) into and around my kneecap area until it was fully absorbed about 20 minutes before a ride as a possible preventative measure and found that my cycle to work left me with no discomfort, no pain, no awareness that my knee even had problems. I experimented with different time periods and found that applying the balm 20 minutes before the activity yielded optimum results while applying it directly before the activity did not provide as much relief.<br /><br />Punishing rides up long hills still left me in discomfort but not in pain, which is a definite improvement. Casual cycle rides left me in no pain or discomfort at all, which was a relief as normally the sensation is somewhat omnipresent.<br /><br />Overall the medicine was a resounding success and we will be ordering some more presently, I foresee it helping massively with a 120 mile bike ride we have coming up next weekend, I predict much soreness and am looking forward to the relief!<br /><br />Many thanks Doctornoname.<br /><br />I hope this review is useful to you and to others.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If anyone who has used the root balm and/or the CBD caps feel free to share. It saves me prostituting myself and feeling dirty.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

Nothing really worked and everything apart from one or two products burned her skin and they didn&#039;t help much anyway.<br /><br />Now after applying it on outbreaks a few times to deal with the tenderness and pain she never really breaks out, when she starts to get the raised bumps that indicate that she is breaking out she just pops some on and it&#039;s sorted.<br /><br />There is another forum member here with much more severe eczema/atopic dermatitis called Psykhe, she finds it invaluable for treating the pain and over the months has found a reduction in frequency and severity of flare ups.(Feel free to correct me on any of that if I&#039;m wrong Psykhe) Another customer has been using it for a few months and is finally finding that it is lessening their eczema, sometimes it can take a while to fix it but it provides great immediate relief.<br /><br />It&#039;s great for any dry skins from sunburn to psoriasis so there is a very good chance it will help.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				In the pursuit of shameless self-prostitution he is a cross-posting from my main review thread(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131780.msg1360368#msg1360368)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Here is another piece of anecdotal evidence for you Doc.<br /><br />The doctor graciously sent me a sample of CBD caps. As I posted earlier in the thread my gf has a chronic autoimmune GI disease that involves a lot of pain (doc has the details).<br /><br />Yesterday she was complaining about a sore stomach. not really a full blown attack but still pretty painful.<br />She took one of the CBD caps and an hour later she turned to me and said<br /><br />(paraphrased) &quot;I&#039;m not feeling any pain now, nothing... no lingering soreness, no pain when moving...nothing.. This is the first time in many years that I&#039;ve never had any pain whatsoever.. It&#039;s so weird&quot;.<br /><br />Since she is not a toker she was a little afraid of getting high from the cap (weird, right ;D ) but she said she felt no high from the cap. Just pain relief. So looks like 1 cap is the perfect dosage for her.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update a little later when she has taken a few more of the caps to see if the pain relief was just circumstantial (I doubt it) or if the caps really helps her manage her inflammatory pain.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jah Bless <br /><br />The Doctor

				Yes and no. Some people have much better relief than others from topical products but I think CBD caps probably have the best chance. Personally I would try both to see if either provide better relief than standard prescription medications, if you make an order for either one of the products pop a note in the address box to remind me and I&#039;ll throw the other in for free.<br /><br />About 75% of users report success with the topical and I suspect it would be higher with the CBD caps, the anti-inflammatory properties as well as the central nervous system depression should work well to control pain and inflammation.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor
