				Hi SR community, this is an SOS for a friend of mine. She was in a car smash recently, just before the birth of her second child, she also has a 3yo and a hubby. The crash has well and truly fucked her back, a number of herniated discs and the pain is mind bending to the point where she was talking leaving the planet, Australian doctors are the lowest grade of mongrel humans when it comes to appropriate pain management. The Hipacratic oath states that there primary function is to alleviate suffering and if one or two scamers get extra medds so be it! The specialists say it will only get worse as the hormones from her birth subside and no words of encouragment and only endone to keep the pain at bay, if she takes enough for the pain she dont like it in her brain plus she has the kids to crawl after, no joke.<br />She is a highly qualified Natropath but can no longer work but has been researching the herb superb.<br /><br />&nbsp;This is where i need help, i have an indoor growing history so ok there but can you tell me is there a preffered strain for medical pot something with a 3month turn around would be good cause then i can set them up in there veg patch, they could do 2 even three a year.<br />What is the most efficient way to cook it so that you can end up with same sized doses, she does&#039;nt want to get bent as such, those kids<br /><br />And do you think a cover letter from her specialist and a pre booked attorney in the advent of a bust is sound, and would it make a difference<br /><br />Cheers Macmeth<br />ps If you have papers on any of this pm me and i will give you my email

				What state are they in? If it&#039;s SA, they are better off. According to regulations:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the definition of simple cannabis offence in section 45A(8) of the Act, the prescribed number of cannabis plants is 1. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />
