				I&#039;ve been a sheltered guy all of my life. The only illegal drugs I&#039;ve ever done are pot (about 3x) and mdma (twice). I&#039;ve never really been around dealers and I don&#039;t know much about it but I&#039;m very interested. Documentaries on drugs barely seem to scratch the surface on how dealers get their stuff. It&#039;s very generic. The only dealer I ever met refused to give me more information than &quot;I know people&quot;. I&#039;m very curious and very interested in how someone gets into the business of dealing drugs, where they get their stuff, how they avoid trouble, how dangerous it is, how much money they had to invest up front, etc.<br /><br />Without giving away any specific names, places, etc (use fakes if you like), I&#039;m interested in hearing some of your stories so I can learn more about the process. If someone wanted to get into the business, how dangerous would it be (assuming they wanted to be small time) and how difficult would it be to find a supplier?

				The main rule of dealing drugs imo is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE. So by virtue of that you never become a snitch. Police are liars and they will tell you anything to get you to start talking i.e. empty threats of long jail terms, they can help you out blah blah blah. It is the single most important rule. If you get to the point where the police want to talk to you, the only thing you can do is make it worse. You CANNOT make things any better at that point. Just be a man and do your time. It&#039;s not that bad. It&#039;s mainly just enforced boredom. Second rule- do NOT front! This causes more trouble than it&#039;s worth. I always tell people I work with when they start to ask (you can always tell when it&#039;s coming) &quot;If you don&#039;t ask me to front I don&#039;t have to say no.&quot; Plus word gets around that you&#039;ll do it and then everyone has their hand out. Thirdly, if possible use the courier method. If you stay at one location with a throw away cell phone, and then relay the info (where to go, how much they want) to a mule with a cheap throw away car and a small amount of product, it makes you very difficult to catch. I learned this method from the Mexican heroin dealers in the Pac NW. People seem to like their drugs to come to them. The trick is to find a trustworthy courier and to have enough business to make it profitable.

				It&#039;s true that you can get addicted to selling... in a sense, anyway. I used to deal small-time, just locally at raves or to friends of friends. The idea was to only finance my own drug use (and subsidize my closest friends) with the profits. But I had a good supplier so my stuff was in high demand. Suddenly I was making a lot of money, my phone was always ringing and many of the people looking to buy from me were total strangers. And I&#039;ve got to tell you, the first few high-value transactions are quite a rush. I got in deeper than I should have, but I was lucky to snap out of it on time. My day job is a very respectable government position, so getting too big in the drug trade was a very dangerous game for me as well as for my family. I talked to my &quot;bosses&quot; about quitting, and when I got their okay I started lowering my supply, randomly missing orders and giving refunds, blaming it on an unstable supply chain. After some time setting this story up, I just told people I had retired because it was becoming too risky and unreliable to get my product. It was bullshit, but it worked. Not everybody was happy with my excuse, but everybody accepted it. Today, I don&#039;t sell anymore. If a friend of mine wants something and I can get it to him without too much inconvenience, I&#039;ll do it for free as a personal favor. Small amounts only, of course. :)<br /><br />Now, how did I get to know my supplier? Well, like many people, I have quite a few high school acquaintances who went on to become major pot heads. When I decided that I wanted to try some psychedelics, I knew that they were my best way into the right circles, so I &quot;got back together with the gang&quot;, as it were (even though I had never been particularly close to any of them, nostalgia is still a good weapon in these situations). I started toking with them (even though I mostly dislike THC). Eventually I got to meet one of their dealers, and while everyone was getting high together I asked him about psys and how come there&#039;s such a small market for them. His answer was basically that there was too little return business, so his gang (which has pretty much a monopoly on drug sales in the North side of my city) decided not to invest in it - but he could get me access to small amounts of LSD from time to time if I really wanted it. This told me something important: that they did have a supplier. He did deliver on that promise a few times, but it was hard as fuck to come by and when it did, it was way too expensive. But I *knew* that there was more acid waiting for me somewhere, and I wanted to get to it. After meeting with the guy a few more times, buying some hash from him, toking together and buttering him up, I got him to talk to the higher-ups for me and ask if they don&#039;t mind my running a test market. It took a lot of asking, negotiating, nagging and begging, but after several months they agreed to hook me up with a little bit of acid and &quot;synthetic shrooms&quot;, which I&#039;m pretty sure is 4-AcO-DMT (it matches up perfectly, dose- and effect-wise, with the 4-aco-dmt I later bought online from several different vendors) to set up shop and see if I could turn a profit. Obviously, I diverted a huge chunk of my first shipments to my own personal stash, and paid for it myself while pretending I had sold it. The rest I actually sold, at first to close friends, as described above. And since, as I said, my supplier had some good shit, slowly but surely, my clientele grew. The &quot;market experiment&quot; was a success, both in its stated and actual goals. In retrospect, though, bluffing those guys like that was a risky move that I wouldn&#039;t advise anyone to make.<br /><br />So the bottom line is, yes, that you have to know someone. But it&#039;s really a lot easier than it seems. I was able to stretch into the right crowds, people that the gangs had little to no contact with since they mostly operate in the slums, where the market was pretty much dominated by coke, speed and downers. I pretty much created the psychedelic market in my region, and since I was the go-to guy for so long I met some really interesting people from all over the place when they happened to be around and looking for a hookup. When I ended my experiment (and from the weight the phrase &quot;slum lord&quot; carries, it&#039;s surprising how nicely the guys took my resignation) there were already other people dealing psys, many of them thanks to out-of-town contacts that I helped establish. I managed to turn a nice profit, even in spite of the pretty hefty commission the gang demanded (which I always paid on schedule - I&#039;ve never had any problems with gang violence, probably because of this diligence and the nature of the specific drugs I was dealing with) and thankfully it seems I was wise enough to quit before I got too big. Psychedelics even started making some in-roads into the slum communities, but unfortunately that trend has been reversed by the near-predominance of crack in the slum drug markets here since about 1998. As far as I know, the guys I dealt with, or whoever took their place, have probably quit pushing psys altogether again. But the other guys who got set up - I like to think of them as &quot;my kids&quot; - are still selling, and from what I hear the rave scene is all the better for it.<br /><br />Well, that&#039;s my story. I hope it gives you the insight you&#039;re after. It&#039;s intentionally vague and inaccurate. My advice to you is: think really long and hard about this before deciding to jump in. I was young and got in way over my head because I wanted access to a large supply of psys (ironically, psychedelic use helped me to realize just how foolish - and unfortunately prevalent - this sort of primitive hoarding mentality is) and it was only by immense luck that I didn&#039;t end up dead somewhere. Once you get through the initial hurdles, though, you suddenly have to be weary of a whole different sort of problem. If your product is good, your price is accessible and you have a well-earned reputation for honesty, you *will* grow, whether you like it or not. You need to be prepared beforehand and figure out a way to put brakes on that growth without pissing off your customers, suppliers or partners. You do NOT want to get too big. You should know when to stop, BEFORE even starting, and have a good plan for it too. It&#039;s not for everyone.<br /><br />Apart from that, I second what onestopshop and adubois said, even though it&#039;s clear that their experience is/was very different from my own. It&#039;s just sound advice overall. :)

				Thank you for the great read Horizons. I can honestly say that I&#039;m more interested in just hearing the stories than thinking about jumping in. If I ever do, it would be an extremely well planned out system with a stopping point. I&#039;m not interested in money or material wealth so much. I just need a boost to help me get my own place (mid twenties and staying with a friend), a running vehicle, and pay for some of the certification tests I wish to take.<br /><br />The truth is, I&#039;m not really much of a drug user. I might drink alcohol once or twice a month at most. I tried weed a few times and it wasn&#039;t for me. MDMA is the only illegal drug I&#039;ve ever enjoyed and I&#039;ve only tried it twice (though that will increase a tad bit more since I&#039;m on this site). <br /><br />Thanks again and I look forward to more stories from everyone!

				You&#039;re welcome! And hey, since you&#039;re here and seem to have a pretty open mind, I&#039;m just going to throw this out there: do LSD. Or some other serotonergic psychedelic, like 4-AcO-DMT, psilocin or 2c-b. It&#039;s a very special and unique experience which I think everyone should have at least once. Go out somewhere nice and warm with beautiful vegetation and make a day of it.<br /><br />I&#039;m suggesting this because you seem like a curious person, a bit introspective, plus you&#039;re not a huge fan of alcohol or weed but like MDMA. Just like me! :) If done right, a psychedelic experience can be a life-changing event.

				I&#039;ll definitely keep those in mind and add them to my list of research. I do hardcore research on things before I try them and make sure I&#039;m as safe as can be. <br /><br />I originally thought ecstasy was a very dangerous drug. When I found out that a friend of mine took some, I became concerned about his safety and jumped online. I watched many documentaries, read three books I purchased off of Amazon, and spent hundreds of hours reading online information specifically on MDMA. When I learned that uncut MDMA is a pretty harmless drug (when used properly), I decided to give it a try. I made sure I had a testing kit, checked pillreports, had water ready, etc.<br /><br />The only serious mistake I&#039;ve ever made while using drugs was when I decided to try 1/2 a pill of ecstasy before I tested it. The kit wasn&#039;t in yet and I was with a girl I really liked. I couldn&#039;t find anything on pill reports either. It ended up being meth and I freaked out and had a terrible panic attack. Meth, coke, heroin, etc, is stuff I definitely want nothing to do with.<br /><br />I did a bit of research on LSD back then and wanted to give it a try but the stories my friends tell me leave me paranoid. I know the good trips are all about the mood and environment so I&#039;ll probably wait until I&#039;m with really good company and candy-flip on a low dose (half a hit?) first. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about the other substances you mentioned. I&#039;ve heard of 2c-b. Is it one of the things that ecstasy pills are commonly cut with?

I&#039;ve heard of 2c-b. Is it one of the things that ecstasy pills are commonly cut with?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Props for being so responsible. I too spent over a year studying about psychedelics before deciding to try LSD. I can recommend several books and online resources if you want (though you probably already know the best online resources, which are Erowid and MAPS).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d recommend candyflipping for a first-time psychedelic user. MDMA and psys tend to potentiate each other a lot, since they both act on serotonin receptors. On the other hand, it&#039;ll make it more likely that you&#039;ll be in a good state of mind during the trip. Ultimately, it&#039;s your call. And yes, you should start off with half a hit if you candyflip (or if you have it on good authority that you&#039;ve come across a strong batch of blotter). But try to work your way up if you enjoy the lower doses. There&#039;s a breakthrough point beyond which the experience can have a very powerful emotional/spiritual aspect.<br /><br />Regarding the other three substances I mentioned: psilocin is the active ingredient in so-called &quot;magic&quot; mushrooms. 4-AcO-DMT and 2c-b are psychedelic RCs. The former is chemically very similar to psilocin (and gets metabolized into psilocin in the liver, though there is speculation that it&#039;s also active on its own - it&#039;s better than a mushroom trip in my experience, but that&#039;s not proof of this claim - it might just be because I&#039;m not ingesting the rest of the mushroom, which is a bit nauseating). 4-AcO-DMT is also known as psilacetin or O-acetoxy-DMT. 2c-b is, IME, a more intense psychedelic, but also a more agitating one. It&#039;s easier to have a bad trip on 2c-b, but since it&#039;s slightly stimulating I prefer it over the others for low-dose trips and occasional nootropic use. If you plan to work up towards higher doses, I&#039;d prefer LSD, then 4-AcO-DMT, then shrooms, and last 2c-b. But of course your mileage may vary. All these drugs act on the same neural receptors, but people usually report big differences between the average trip on each substance (think &quot;same song, different equalizer&quot;). What works better for me may not work as well for you. That said, LSD is by far the most popular of these drugs, probably because it seldom causes physical discomfort, while the others tend to cause varying amounts of nausea, thirst and bruxism during the come-up.<br /><br />Since 4-AcO-DMT and 2-b are research chemicals, not much information is available on their long-term side effects other than the personal experience of long-time psychedelic researchers such as Sasha Shulgin (author of PiHKAL and TiHKAL), which indicates (but doesn&#039;t prove) that there isn&#039;t anything to worry about. If you want to try them, it&#039;s important to be responsible and buy a milligram-precision scale (jeweler scales will set you back about fifty USD and do the job fine) to know how much you&#039;re taking. Erowid has many articles and trip reports, as well as very good dose-effect charts compiled from a huge pool of anecdotal evidence. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of ecstasy pills being cut with 2c-b. That would be very dangerous indeed, since an unwitting user might end up having a case of serotonin toxicity. From a commercial standpoint, it doesn&#039;t make much sense for someone to cut ecstasy with 2c-b when they can sell it in its own right for the same or even a higher price. AFAIK, ecstasy is cut either with inert substances or with uppers (like the meth in your example), but not really with other strictly psychoactive substances.<br /><br />Whichever drug you choose, remember the three keys to a psychedelic trip: set, setting and dose. Set means your mindset. Try to be calm, happy and unburdened going into the trip. Anxiety, expectations and worries will set you up for a bad time. Regardless of what happens, remember that the trip will pass, that you didn&#039;t overdose (don&#039;t worry about overdosing - the LD50 for LSD is so high that it&#039;s never been discovered. On mice, it&#039;s about 400 times the active dose. Whatever may go wrong during an acid trip, it will never be a case of overdosing) and that everything will be fine. Setting is your environment, including ambient sound/music and the people around you. Psychedelics put you in a suggestible state, so these things will have a big influence on your mood and on the trip itself. Dose is pretty self-explanatory: don&#039;t take more than you can handle.<br /><br />Timothy Leary&#039;s &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot; is a good (and short) trip guide you can read to know a bit of what to expect. It&#039;s a translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Bardo Thodol, adapting the texts about after-death experiences to psychedelic experiences (Leary believed them to be the same thing in essence). If you can ignore (or agree with!) the esoteric overtones, though, it&#039;s very useful. Fun fact! The Beatles song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; was inspired by Lennon&#039;s reading this book on acid. The first line, &quot;Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream&quot;, is taken ipsis literis from Leary&#039;s book. For a more clinical approach, Dr. Stanislav Grof&#039;s &quot;LSD Psychotherapy&quot; is a lengthy but fascinating read about how LSD has been used in psychiatric patients, their experiences with it, the results of treatment and speculations on how and why such results were obtained. Rick Strassman&#039;s &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&quot; is also a good read in the same clinical vein, but DMT is a very different drug: its effects are much more intense and short-lived (between two and twenty minutes, versus LSD&#039;s eight to twelve hours) but are qualitatively very similar, if on a much higher scale. Strassman speculates a little too wildly on a poorly-tested and by no means proven hypothesis about DMT production inside mammalian pineal glands as a way to explain peak experiences (birth, NDEs, mystical epiphanies and visions, and even some forms of schizophrenia) but apart from that his book is very good. Just for clarity&#039;s sake, DMT and 4-AcO-DMT are not the same drug: though they&#039;re chemically very similar, their doses, trip durations and &quot;equalizers&quot; are all very different.<br /><br />I hope I didn&#039;t scare you off! But something tells me that, if anything, I may have piqued your interest one small bit. Hopefully that&#039;s the case. If you want to discuss this further, feel free to PM me. I&#039;m a bit embarrassed of hijacking your thread like this, though... SR community, please bring more vendor stories this way!&nbsp; 8)

				^^^With respect to Horizons advice...<br /><br />LSD was my least experimented with (6 times in my life) but my absolute favorite.&nbsp; I like to think it made me the person I am today with all of the introspective and unexplainable ideas/feelings you experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do your research on the safety, the normal body feels and expected parts of the trip (coming up, peak coming down) and how you may experience them. <br /><br />My opinion: Don&#039;t do so much research on other people&#039;s trips.&nbsp; I just feel that it may shape your expectations and alter some of the experience that you would otherwise have naturally had.&nbsp; It is introspective, make it about you, not about anyone else.&nbsp; Most importantly, try and have fun with it!

				Shadow the best dealers I&#039;ve ever known were the ones that didn&#039;t touch their product. They make the most bread because everyone knows they make their money on the come back, not on the grift trying to get their little buzz that day. Good luck whatever you decide.

				well my story starts a little different than most. I grew up on a little spec of an island with political system that left much to be desired. Anyway I was lucky enough to leave and meet up with some old friends and get a job dishwashing in a peice of shit community i was a part of.&nbsp; so one day this asshole&nbsp; knew drove by and was like &quot;hey you wanna make a quick buck&quot; and i ofcourse agreed and so began my entry into the drug world.&nbsp; there were lots of ups and downs and the things i saw would defy blow,&nbsp; i saw tables with cocaine piled into foot size mountains, ive seen partners executed,and hell i have even my best friend killed for fucking with my sister, just just unnacceptable. but so far shits going pretty good, ive got this wife that looks like the catlady from that batman movie, too bad her titties look like two fried eggs hanging on nails now if ya know what mean. Anyway peace of i got some coke to do and i think i hear something in the back yard!
