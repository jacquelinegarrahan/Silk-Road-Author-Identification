				Boomers on both sides of the divide were/are self-righteous turds. It stemmed in part from the fact that they were a youth population bomb - it was a weird circumstance that after 1945-50, everybody was a young person. This was the anxiety Burgess was fleshing out in Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />When Boomers came of age, they took over the asylum - they decided the world revolves around them permanently. I grew up hearing from Vietnam guys about what badasses they were and from faggot peaceniks about how they rescued niggers, etc. Really pompous mentality that nobody else really has. Boomers don&#039;t like Gen-Xers because we remind them they&#039;re old, we&#039;re comparatively few in number, and we were/are just supposed to be a sideshow to the Great Boomer Narrative that never ends. These people literally believe everything Kennedy said was true, that they are the best people in the world, that they have some special &#039;&#039;mission&#039;&#039; etc.<br /><br />They still think the Civil Rights Struggles is continuing on, that there is really a group of Republicans in a smoke filled room trying to keep niggers and faggots down.<br /><br />Gays are the new Blacks. The civil rights party doesn&#039;t have to end.<br /><br />Their infantile pop-culture worship is staggering too. They&#039;re 65 year old people who think celebrities are important historical figures. I mean does anyone realize how weird it is for a guy in his 60s or 70s to be talking about some lame pop-idol like Bob Dylan as if he&#039;s Thyucidides? <br /><br />Generation X is full of idiots but you don&#039;t hear people saying that listening to Soundgarden changed the world or that Glenn Danzig is a philosopher

				I note Boomers like to use &quot;our President&quot; in describing Barry Obama. Its part of their celebrity worship sensibility. They get mad if anyone criticizes Kennedy - they think Kennedy was some kind of God-man.<br /><br />Obama is black and he&#039;s the President - so he&#039;s some kind of sacred icon to them. They don&#039;t look at the Pres. as some frontman like normal people do. Scheuer actually pointed that out - he said Americans don&#039;t understand jihadists simply because they think in terms of celebrities.<br /><br />The reverence for pop culture is part of the Year Zero programming the Boomers got: &quot;whatever you little darlings come up with must be better than the stuff that got us in such a mess&quot;.

				I would be inclined to see the &quot;Baby Boomer&quot;generation as akin to middle managers in the way the world works.&nbsp; This metaphor is primarily the past decade or two, and is now changing. <br /><br />Will they or how will they ascend to truly elite levels of global control is an ongoing question.<br /><br />I am inclined to speculate that wealth, power, and violence has flowed along blood lines for centuries in ways about which most of us are very, very ignorant.&nbsp;
