				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />WOW, I don&#039;t think Ben and I have ever worked that hard in our entire lives, but it&#039;s DONE.&nbsp; All the Customer Appreciation orders are shipped and so are all the orders placed Monday and Tuesday except one where the address wasn&#039;t complete and it didn&#039;t get fixed in time so it will ship on Thursday.<br /><br />So, we are caught up, all the current orders will be shipping tomorrow and it will stay that way.<br /><br />With a little bit of luck, we&#039;ll get an order of 2mg xanax in tomorrow or Friday and we&#039;ll start having that product again as well.<br /><br />One small issue is that this has meant I haven&#039;t had time to answer all the pm&#039;s that people have sent.&nbsp; So pls just be a bit patient and I am going to spend all day tomorrow answering the remaining 125+ pm&#039;s that I haven&#039;t gotten to yet.&nbsp; Every single one will get answered and most, if not all of them, will get answered tomorrow.<br /><br />Thanks again to all our loyal buyers for making the sale an ASTOUNDING SUCCESS and thanks to MR. SR for thinking of it in the first place.&nbsp; He gave up a LOT of revenue to have that sale, and I&#039;m always quick enough to point out that I think that the new fees are too high, so I want to give credit where credit is due and say &quot;thanks&quot; to Mr. SR for having the sale and bringing us 3 of the most HUMONGOUS sales days we&#039;ve ever had in our lives.&nbsp; It was really great and just give us a little more advance warning next time and we&#039;ll bring in all kind of rare and exotic items so that we can have a true EXTRAVAGANZA SALE for you next time! ;)<br /><br />everyone have a good night, or what&#039;s left of it, haha!<br />&gt;Alex &amp; Ben&lt;
