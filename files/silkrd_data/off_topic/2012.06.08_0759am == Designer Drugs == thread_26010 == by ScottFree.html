				Hey guys I&#039;m new here, and I have never done anything other than marijuana and painkillers.<br /><br />What&#039;s your view on those legal in the US designer drugs? <br /><br />I&#039;ve always wanted to try a hallucinogen.<br />Are there any good ones that wont kill all my brain cells the first use?<br />I would buy the real stuff on silk road, but I really want to leave that long process of trying to staying anonymous as a last resort.

				If I&#039;ve got this right, you want to know what&#039;s currently legal in the United States so you can buy it online because you&#039;re not quite ready to purchase illegally off of the Silk Road correct? ???<br /><br />If you want a threshold psychedelic experience purchase 5-MeO-DALT.<br />If you want a light psychedelic experience purchase 25i-NBOMe.<br />If you want a moderate psychedelic experience purchase 4-AcO-DMT.<br />If you want a more intense psychedelic experience purchase 2C-E.<br />If you want a dissociative psychedelic experience purchase MXE.<br /><br />As far as I&#039;m aware they&#039;re all legal research chemicals in the US, although they might be considered analogs of illegal drugs so it&#039;s still risky buying them.

				Let me tell you, I have tried a long list of legel ethogens and smart drugs. Envy ecstasy pills. &quot;super skunk&quot; and &quot;spice&quot; cannabis alternative. &quot;Digonesis&quot; an trippy substance. Ive tried &quot;Space -E&quot; &quot;Love-E&quot; and all those brand of things. Snow blow, Pipazines...The list goes on.<br />Let me tell you now I have had nothing but negative experiences with them.<br />They either made me feel sick, or had no desired effect, or in most cases both.<br /><br />Just because somethings illegal dosnt mean its going to &quot;kill braincells after first use&quot;! Try some acid or shrooms&nbsp; :) but honestly, stay away from those designer drugs. At least with most illegal drugs they have been around long enough for you to know the harms they cause long term. Most of these designer ones are quite untested. <br /><br />But, saying that, maybe there is one out there that is the dogs bolloks that I dont know about. I mean, Drone was legal in the UK at one point, and lots of people loved that stuff.
