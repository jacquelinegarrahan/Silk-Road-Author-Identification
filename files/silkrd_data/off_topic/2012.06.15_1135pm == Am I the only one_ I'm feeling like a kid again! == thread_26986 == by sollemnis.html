				Does anyone else struggle getting to sleep when expecting an order? Seriously, when I&#039;m expecting an order to come through, I struggle to get to sleep, I get really excited. I find myself in bed, trying my best to get sleep! Eventually when I do sleep, I wake up to a lovely package at my doorstep! That in its self gives me a buzz!<br /><br />Opening it, smelling it, weighing out a dose! The whole process just excites me so much!&nbsp; ;D

				Even more difficult is trying to sleep after the order already arrived but you can&#039;t indulge because you are saving it for something :O<br /><br />

				I know the feeling Blackend, I hate having to save it too. Very rarely do though, I mostly do my drugs alone the day they come. And lol Gary, I have Nitrazepam, take it and it knocks me clean out.. only way I&#039;m getting sleep if an order is being expected. <br /><br />@ CX, never had a dream about it, but I do always go bed early! Just so the day comes quicker!

				Having insomnia i struggle to sleep a lot.<br />When i know ive got something coming it takes my mind off not being able to sleep.<br />When it arrives it makes me want to stay awake and get stoned forever.<br />I guess it is a&nbsp; bit of a catch 22 situation.<br /><br />But is is fun :-)

				The whole waiting process gives me a sense of nostalgia, so I would agree that it more or less makes me feel like a kid again. When I was young, my family would celebrate the religious part of Christmas on Christmas day, but the gift-giving at some point before Christmas. This was to focus on the important things (Jesus, and family, and yadda yadda) but still have fun doing gift exchanges around the same time. My sister and I were never told what day the gift-giving would be, except that it would occur during school vacation, so every morning we&#039;d run down the stairs and look under the tree. And when we eventually saw those gifts, well, it&#039;s a similar feeling to seeing that &quot;package too big&quot; slip in my Post Office box.<br /><br />I love this place.

				Losing sleep over Nitrazepam would indeed be ironic. I&#039;m expecting some orders tomorrow, pretty excited. I avoid taking Nitrazepam though, makes me feel groggy the next day. I only take it as a last resort. I can handle a night without sleep to be honest, plus this forum keeps me occupied all night.

I ordered June 12, he changed the status to in transit a few hours later. (he only ships tuesday and thursday). I may just count it as a loss if it&#039;s not here soon. Kinda sucks that I FE&#039;d because of good ratings. Oh well, If it comes it comes. No harm done.<br /><br />sdesu
