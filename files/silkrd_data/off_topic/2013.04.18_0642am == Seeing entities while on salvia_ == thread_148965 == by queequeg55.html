				Do you have recurring encounters with entities or beings while on high-dose salvia trips?<br /><br /><br /><br />On my 30x-40x trips, I almost always experience the following (not necessarily in the order presented, as time is often impossible to discern):<br /><br />- Complete dissociation from physical surroundings and ego<br /><br />- Field of vision shrinks to a pinpoint - it feels like I&#039;m falling backwards down a tunnel within my brain, and the field of vision that I normally have shrinks and shrinks until it is swallowed up by blackness<br /><br />- Within the blackness is a green pixelated kingdom landscape - although pixelated, it makes me think of the word &quot;verdant&quot;, just green and pastoral and silent.&nbsp; Its like viewing a massively colorful landscape on a TV where the contrast is turned down, so its kind of put through a darkened filter.&nbsp; There are slightly &quot;medieval&quot; castles in this world, mostly vacant, again all pixelated.&nbsp; The whole &quot;verdant&quot; yet &quot;pixelated&quot; quality is reminiscent of the greener levels in Super Mario World - but blown up to life proportions, and more bizarre, but thats the closest thing I can compare it to. <br /><br />- I presented the &quot;locations&quot; above as pretty straightforward and logically built - but this description is only possible after numerous trips, as I never begin a trip seeing a congruous whole picture of the world - what happens is&nbsp; I usually find myself looping endlessly within a &quot;tree&quot; or a &quot;wall&quot; in this salvia landscape, and after what feels like about 50-100 years of mind-looping in the architecture of an object in this world, my brain finally becomes able to extricate itself from the loop, and catch a glimpse of the whole surrounding WORLD - this usually only happens briefly, and its during these brief moments where my brain is able to &quot;look around&quot; that I can see more of this world, and that I can see the beings that are surrounding me...<br /><br />- ... these beings or &quot;friends&quot; are shadowy and formless - I say &quot;friends&quot; because of how &quot;close&quot; they feel emotionally, they feel like I have known them for millions of years, for all eternity.&nbsp; But they aren&#039;t warm - they are familiar, and close, but cold, and sad that I am only there temporarily.&nbsp; I can&#039;t really see them, they stay in the peripherals of the field of view - I feel like I can turn my brain to the right and left and see more of them - its like being in a fishbowl and trying to strain to see through the think distorted glass all around you, to the beings that are so close to you but you are unable to see them fully - I can hear their voices and I can feel them holding onto me, telling me how glad they are that I&#039;m here now, and asking &quot;are you here to stay&quot;?&nbsp; They have been whispering to each other about me - I disappear from their world so frequently (IE, i&#039;m in reality and not in salvia world), but whenever I rejoin, they chatter and hope that I will stay - not out of any respect for me, its actually more of an annoyance and expectation - they wonder when will I stop dallying and frolicking in the dream that is reality and join them?<br /><br />- Of course I&#039;m not there to stay, and the trip fades out, and I gradually tunnel up through the hole in my mind back to &quot;reality&quot;, which now feels more like &quot;dream&quot; and less like reality.&nbsp; I re-realize my name, and my body, and these things feel foreign, and strange.&nbsp; The &quot;thing&quot; that I was in the salvia world, the essence or the point of observation or whatever I &quot;was&quot; - that feels far more real, and it takes many minutes or sometimes an hour to grow re-accustomed to &quot;being human&quot;. <br /><br /><br /><br />I almost always see the same entities and get the same feelings, and its occurred through 10+ salvia trips on different days, some of them years apart, the most recent being a few months ago.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying it means anything - but I find it intriguing how there seems to be a persistent world within these experiences that just grows with each experience but is fundamentally the same - and the creatures that I encounter are always asking me to stay, and they always feel so familiar, like I am &quot;at home&quot;, but in a foreign, strange, slightly scary way.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I type this I know it sounds silly or cliched, but having had these experiences numerous times, where in all of them I lose complete memory of my physical self, it makes me wonder:&nbsp; when I die, will I join this world and these beings permanently?<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of others mentioning meeting beings on salvia - but never really discussed - anyone here meet other beings while in salvia dimension?

				Hey, I do too. <br /><br />My entities probe and test me.&nbsp; &nbsp;They hold me down while they operate on me. They always tear me apart I to pieces and puts together again.&nbsp; Fuck up shit. My understanding is that what we are seeing here is out own mind and its mechanics and instincts.

				Sounds intense.&nbsp; I sent you a PM - but the basic questions I had are:&nbsp; do you ever get a glimpse of these entities, and do they feel like they hold beneficial or harmful intent for you?<br /><br />I think salvia really reveals how fully foreign and alien our own minds are - the vast majority of our mind has never had light shed on it, and when a spotlight is aimed into these corners, some of these beings welcome us and others shy away from the light fearfully.
