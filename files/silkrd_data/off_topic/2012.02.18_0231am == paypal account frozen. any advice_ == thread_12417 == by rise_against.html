				The same thing has happened to me. My funds have been held on PayPal for more than 6 months now. I have sent them at least 5 emails, the first one I sent was months ago, I have never received a response to ANY of my emails.<br /><br />The reason my funds were held in the 1st place was because I tried to get a PayPal MasterCard. I don&#039;t have a credit score, so when it ran my SSN it came back with nothing, and apparently that&#039;s &quot;suspicious&quot;. I have sent them a photocopy of my drivers license, my proof of address and a photocopy of my social security card THREE TIMES. It&#039;s not asking me to verify my identity anymore, but any funds I receive from an eBay sale are held for 21 days for absolutely no fucking reason.<br /><br />I&#039;ve called them, I&#039;ve e-mailed them, I&#039;ve proven my identity enough fucking times, there no reason my money should be held. I just said fuck it and stopped selling anything on eBay, so it doesn&#039;t affect me, but it&#039;s still fucking bull shit. The only advice I can give you is to get your money out of PayPal as soon as you can and never fucking use it again. The way PayPal has handled (or rather ignored) my situation is the most unprofessional shit I&#039;ve ever seen. They literally just don&#039;t give a shit and apparently don&#039;t read their emails. I could bitch about them all day, lol...

				I had the same problem with Paypal/Ebay.&nbsp; I had 100% positive feedback on about 90 transactions on Ebay and sold a few things a couple months ago and Paypal held my money for about 3 weeks.&nbsp; Fuck them.&nbsp;

				You said you&#039;ve called them, what has their response been then? <br /><br />I spent months going through the hoops with emails, uploading docs, passports, etc, then finally called them 1 day and they sorted it out pretty quickly... That was just my experience. They would take weeks to reply to email, but once you have a human on the line, they&#039;ll have a harder time ignoring you.

				I say fuck them.&nbsp; Sue them if they have your money.&nbsp; They limited my account without any reason provided, and I really am an average joe with no history of problems or &quot;weird&quot; use.&nbsp; The only way I could find out why, would require a subpena.&nbsp; Even then, they said there is zero chance the decision to limit my account would change.....and &quot;can&#039;t say why that is either, it is also proprietary.&quot;

				When I called them I talked to a foreign guy that I couldn&#039;t understand and I was eventually put on hold for 9 minutes before I hung up. I called them again probably a month later and another foreign guy told me he &quot;wasn&#039;t allowed&quot; to give me that information and that it wasn&#039;t going to do any good to call them again.<br /><br />Since I stopped selling anything on eBay, I have not been affected, but I wish I still could...

				I had the same thing happen, I wasn&#039;t paying attention and logged in from TOR. The IP address was from eastern Europe and they saw that as suspicious activity. All I had to do to get my account back was change my password and upload a bank statement to prove it was me. Everything was back to normal within a week.

				I&#039;ve had similar experiences. Fuck them is right. <br /><br />They are the worst managed corporations I&#039;ve ever seen. I can see Amazon existing in 10 years time, but not Ebay, I think their competitor Ebid will eventually supersede them.

Actually if you want to get technical it&#039;s not money at all, it&#039;s more of an IOU like a bond.<br /><br />Now, if they can guarantee that you won&#039;t need the money for X months or days, then they have an extremely stable revenue stream that they can invest into the stock market and their business temporarily.<br /><br />They give you your money back eventually, minus the costs of inflation of course, and they are up in profit by virtue of your &#039;investment&#039;.<br /><br />It is nothing short of kidnapping your money and should be illegal. At least banks and insurance companies offer services in return for the float they are given e.g. rate of interest on deposits and protection. It&#039;s basically 21st century robbery dressed up as technical sophistication. <br /><br />The idea they do this for their buyer customers is delirious. Sure they do. <br /><br />The Silk Road does Escrow. Escrow is a legitimate service because buyers and sellers know what they&#039;re getting into i.e. we know the rules.<br /><br />Paypal is NOT doing Escrow. Does anybody remember being informed your money would be frozen in advance? Banks has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure you know what you&#039;re getting into. Paypal isn&#039;t registered as an online bank and so it doesn&#039;t have fiduciary responsibility despite the fact it does pretty much everything a bank does.<br /><br />It&#039;s bullshit of the highest order and it&#039;s worse because the so called consumer protection agencies are fully complicit with Paypal because it makes so much money for them.<br /><br />

				CLEARNET!!!<br /><br />http://www.paypalsucks.com/<br /><br />CLEARNET!!!<br /><br />They used to be much worse back in the day, before eBay bought them up. Trust me, before that they were REAL buffoons. Yell at you on the phone and shit. In 2001 the stole around 2k from me. Which prompted me to rip them off for 35K under various assumed IDs with floating deposits :P<br /><br />The funny part was and is, that PayPal only sucks for honest people. Their alleged &quot;security matrix&quot; is a joke to play, as many online frauds will happily tell you.
