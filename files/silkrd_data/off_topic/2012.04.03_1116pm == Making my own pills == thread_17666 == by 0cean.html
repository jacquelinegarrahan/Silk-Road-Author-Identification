				Hey guys,<br /><br />Just a normal US citizen here with ounces and ounces of dutch mdma at my disposal. I really would like to get a pill press machine and do small time pill manufacturing for me and my friends.<br /><br />Few questions, <br /><br />Would a standard 1/4 inch pill press I buy off ebay do the job to make a solid enough pill?<br /><br />What are the best non active binders to use? I wanna stamp a smiley face or something simple into a nice firm pill with nothing but 150mg of mdma in each one.<br /><br />Please let me know the difference between&nbsp; say a 150$ press and a 300$ one, does the sturdiness of the pill rely on the press or the chemicals used to bind it?<br /><br />Thanks!

				A mold pressing 10-30 pills at a time is a bit overkill.<br /><br />Ill probably only ever crank out 100 pills a month tops. Like I said its just for me and some friends, so pressing 2 pills a minute really doesnt bother me. <br /><br />What about binders/how to make a pill thats fairly solid? Not like Defqon1 / Qdance dutch pill solid but like a pokeball.

				If your just doing a small amount then a pollen press will be sufficient. Manual presses don&#039;t create enough pressure to keep the pill from crumbling tho. For a nice solid pill you would want something automatic or semi-automatic. And just a heads up,&nbsp; if you buy a pill press off eBay chances are you will have LE knocking on your door. There are whole divisions of LE that are dedicated to browsing the shopping carts of eBay buyers. <br /><br />Want to know a fun game? Go search for someone who has bought palladium chloride (an essential component for E manufacturing). Look what else they bought. Probably a scale, some glassware, other chemicles such as mercuric acid. You&#039;ll even find people who buy glassware and 3 or 4 lithium computer batteries. Hmm wonder what they&#039;re doing? If we as regular people can see that what do you think LE can see. Ship a pill press to your house and somebody is guarantee someone will take notice.<br /><br />What I did, and recommend to you: deposit money to your PayPal account using a moneypak. Make sure the PayPal contains none of your real information and don&#039;t ever log into it from your own IP address. Public computers are best. Find a press which will allow for local pickup. Take a cab to and from the shop so that your license plate is not accidentally recorded by a nearby camra. Take it home and enjoy with piece of mind that you&#039;ll never catch a manufacturing charge.<br /><br />Just my .02.

				Thanks dude thats helpful advice.<br /><br />Ill be sure to avoid all of that,<br /><br />seems you have experience with this kind of thing<br /><br /><br />Say I have 150mg of mdma I wish to put into a pill, how should I go about creating a strong enough pill with a semi auto press? like what should I add with the mdma since mdma itself doesnt hold together too well

				Regarding binders you should use a glucose-based pill binder because it&#039;s made of natural ingredients. Using chemical binders can cause people to be ill so when that happens people wont come back and buy them. However when using glucose-based binder make sure your raise the pressure on the pill press.<br /><br />Lim<br />

				In my experience the pill is more compact with a combination of active ingredient, binders, and fillers. You can get these imported from the UK for about $20 per kilogram plus shipping. Most machines can adjust pill width so you kind of have to figure out what ratio of the 3 compounds you need through mathematics. Example: if you use the press and the pill that comes out weighs 0.5 grams, make sure you load the machine with a ratio of 150mg of mdma and 350mg of a filler/ binder mix. MAKE SURE YOU MIX ALL THREE COMPONENTS THROUGHLY BEFORE ADDING TO THE MACHINE. Everybody has there preference for the ratio of filler to binder so search the web to and test some ratios to see which works best for the machine you have (different ratios work better at different pressures)

				Thanks all for the input<br /><br />I talked it over with friends and decided the last thing I need to get wrapped up in is small scale pill pressing, I already am enough of a felon thanks to selling unpressed mdma :P.<br /><br />
