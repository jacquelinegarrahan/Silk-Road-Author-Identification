				Chemists being chemists, derivatives&nbsp; of chemicals are always going to be found, regardless of their legality; this has been proven with the trend of designer drugs.<br />my question to the community is that if the 5 staples in the title of this thread were legal or decriminalized in some way, would their be any need or demand for the incredible range of new compounds (psychedelic especially) we see around today other than in an almost obsessive chemical sense like Shulgin posseses.<br /><br />love to hear your thoughts.

				Maybe not. You may add meth to that list. But no if they were legal or decriminalized then maybe silk road would fade away as well

				People will always be looking for novelty and want to try new chemicals, regardless of what gets made legal.<br /><br />There are a lot of Shulgin-ites and I don&#039;t expect they&#039;ll ever stop. I don&#039;t want them too, either. I just hope they don&#039;t get hurt. :)

				Initially, Silk Road would fucking flourish.&nbsp; The question would be how long until the Pharmeceutical companies got involved and caught up with demand. Probably a matter of a week or so. MAYBE longer.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, the vendors that would be lucky enough to be holding bulk would be able to charge just about whatever they pleased near a out. <br /><br />As for new analoughes and what not, I doubt it. There will always be something in the process of being &quot;researched&quot; because curiosity is just human nature. However, the whole point of these &quot;designer drugs,&quot; if you will, was to bypass the laws placed on your list of substances. Why do people sniff paint? Have you ever seen someone with golden noses nostrils and upper lips because it&#039;s,&quot;the good shit (lmqo)&#039;,? I think the demand would be obsolete compared to now. There will always be people that prefer MDA over MDMA, but to each his own. We all know body chemistry is different for every human being, but the ones you listed got listed for a reason.

You can&#039;t patent cannabis or cocaine(naturally occurring) and the patent(s) on heroin have to be so old that I find it hard to believe they haven&#039;t expired. I dunno about MDMA or LSD, but if those had patents, they&#039;ve probably expired as well

				Absolutely, there will always be a group of people out there that will want to experiment and indulge in new drugs. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=52753.msg517998#msg517998">Quote from: ralph123 on October 12, 2012, 02:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe not.

For example, the black market for weed in California and Holland remains very buoyant despite weed being legalised (to an extent). People are always going to seek the best deals, and if legit market is too expensive, restrictive or inconvenient, people will go elsewhere and find the option that&#039;s the most appealing to the best of their own interests.
