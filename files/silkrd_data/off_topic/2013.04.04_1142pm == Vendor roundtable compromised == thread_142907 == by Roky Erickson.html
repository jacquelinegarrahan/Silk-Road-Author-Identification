				I previously asked why the mod scout was allowed access to the vendor roundtable but was assured he was a vendor before mod, which is fine. I don&#039;t understand how the mod samesamebutdifferent is allowed access though, I know he is not and never was a vendor, just a random who was made mod recently. I know I am treating the vendor roundtable as a public viewing area, and many other vendors should or already do. This guy ssbd is just some random pc powertripper that begged his way into a modship, how do we know he is not a pig? Seems rather likely reading through his posts, he loves to exert authority. <br /><br />Why was he chosen to be a mod anyway? I assumed he had been around a long time or something but I just had a look at his first post:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45547.msg484951#msg484951">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on September 25, 2012, 10:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">New to SR and am interested in hearing other peoples experiences of aussie vendors or international for that matter. Recently made my first order and it arrived promptly with good coms from the vendor, the product though was unfortunately rubbish. Contacted the vendor and exchanged a few very cordial messages and agreed on a possible rectification. A short while later I checked the feedback of the vendor to see if anyone else has posted an issue to see a glowing report of all aspects of the transaction or the same product and this has raised my suspicions as there is no way ANYONE could consider this product any good.<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this? I am wondering if vendors post spurious feedback to boost their ratings and discredit genuine disgruntled customers??<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So this guy shows up,&nbsp; instantly annoys the mods to make him a mod too, and now has access to the vendor roundtable, only a few weeks after joining? I think a new vendor roundtable should be made, with tougher prerequisites as well, the current one fails in its aim to provide vendors a safe place to converse... about drugs and shit..

				Samesamebutdifferent is an invaluable snr member of the forums who goes out of his way, hours a day, to help individuals having issues with SR. Until you&#039;ve contributed something similar you should shut up. It&#039;s April dude, that quote you pulled is from September of last year, hardly a few weeks. I trust DPR made him a mod for good reason, and you shouldn&#039;t be saying anything in the vendor discussions that can compromise security, so I&#039;m not sure what your beef is.

				The vendor round table needs to be kept moderated like the rest of the forums, and if you think it&#039;s immune to infiltration you&#039;re very naive friend.<br />Anyone can become a vendor and earn round table access, even without actually selling anything illicit.<br /><br />SSBD has always contributed positively to the forums since the day he joined and I was one of a few that had recommended him to be a mod before it even happened.<br /><br />I suggest you contribute to the road in a positive way instead of fear-mongering.<br />

If he is not a pig (and I&#039;m not saying he isn&#039;t), then surely the fact that he was so easily able to access modship and therefore, the vendor forums, would mean that the pigs will definitely be starting up multiple ass kissing accounts in the hopes of becoming a mod. When that happens (may already have happened), then choosing mods will become troublesome, and errors costly. Come on people think on a higher level.

				Who gives a fuck if the mods are possibly cops. There job is to keep some order in the forums and answer questions...I think it would be funny actually, a cop doing all this work hoping to gain some &quot;insider&quot; knowledge.

				While you&#039;re up there thinking on a higher level friend, you might want to consider removing round table access for every single account that currently has it, because it would be impossible for a LEO to pose as a vendor and work their way in, and on the same note, it would be impossible for a vendor to hand over their credentials under duress by a LEO...

				For what it&#039;s worth, I can verify that Scout was indeed a vendor for awhile.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say anything more than that, but my point is that the whole thing about him being a vendor first isn&#039;t a lie.<br /><br />So now both SSBD and Scout have been vouched for.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really see the issue here.&nbsp; If you&#039;re worried about LE in general, well, you should be.&nbsp; Always assume they&#039;re listening to every word.&nbsp; Nothing is completely secure.

				I think people dont realise how massive SR is and therefor how many vendors there actually are.<br />Every vendor is in theory entitled to have access to the roundtable so to think that such a forum can be kept &quot;secure&quot; or private is a little naive imho.<br />&nbsp;8)

The very concept of the vendor roundtable being &quot;compromised&quot; by having my mod it is also laughable but everyone is entitled to an opinion. How many members does this place have now? 59,000+? how many vendors have vendor status for their forum accounts? I must get 50+ requests a week from people asking for this, either way the point I&#039;m making is there are plenty of eyes in there already. If you feel the current arrangements are putting anyone at risk I&#039;d invite those people to take a good look at what they are posting, as blueveil said its like snitching on yourself if you are feeling compromised.<br /><br />And to be quite honest what gets posted in there would be of minimal interest to most people anyway, no offense intended vendors but you know what I&#039;m talking about, its hardly an LE dream database of incriminating evidence. In saying that though I do take vendor privacy very seriously and fully appreciate the need for you guys to have safe space to discuss your business.<br /><br />Not sure what your beef is with me Roky and too be honest I don&#039;t really care as my time on here is spent dealing with far more important matters than whatever little agenda it is you have going on. I&#039;d prefer it if you didn&#039;t make up bullshit allegations or try and cast dispersions by spreading FUD but I&#039;m not going to get drawn into another ugly flame war with you. I wasn&#039;t even going to dignify this thread with a response but after reading some of the kind words of other forum members I thought I should at least acknowledge those individuals and say thanks.<br /><br />Back to modding...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				+1 to Scout and SSBD. I don&#039;t think people realize how much actual work modding around here must be. I doubt most of you would be able to do it if you even had the opportunity. Who needs the constant headache? Having to keep your eye on everything at once to make sure nobodys personal information is being shared, nothing that harms SR or the community is being posted, the scammers are kept at bay, etc etc. It&#039;s much easier to sit back, get high, and let someone else handle all of this shit.
