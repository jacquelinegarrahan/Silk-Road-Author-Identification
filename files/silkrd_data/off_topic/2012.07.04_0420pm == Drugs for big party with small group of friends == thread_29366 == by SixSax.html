				So, I&#039;m looking for suggestions on the right mix of drugs for a party I&#039;m having this summer.<br /><br />Basically, a couple of us are turning 30, another one just got a great new job and the others just want to party because it&#039;s summer and vacation time.<br /><br />Right now what we have between us is a few grams of really good weed (indica) and a couple of grams of high-quality MDMA crystals but that&#039;s not gonna last very long.<br /><br />Our plan is for a two-day party with 5-7 of us in total. The party will take place in my apartment and we&#039;re sort of trying to iron out the specifics as to what other drugs we should get. And what we need except for the drugs.<br /><br />One suggestion from one of my friends was to get some cocaine and do MDMA + smoke weed one night and do coke the second night.<br /><br />Anyone feel like coming up with good ideas for a good time?

				The MDMA + Coke + Weed sounds good! Have you thought about mephedrone? It feels very similar to amphetamine, coke and mdma. All in one powder! You could stay up for a couple nights at least on it too :D

				I would recommend getting some LSD and candy flipping that with the MDMA. <br /><br />Take some of the coke then when you&#039;re coming down!<br />Some K would probably fit right into that weekend at some point as well!

Didn&#039;t even think of hallucinogens. That might be a good idea. :)<br /><br />Might be one or two of my friends who will abstain from it though. Still, could be a good time anyway. Good suggestion. :)

				Take the MDMA and then as it starts to wear off, take a dose of 2C-B!

				Btw, I should probably mention that this isn&#039;t necessarily a 48hr non-stop party, partying from late one afternoon &#039;til early next morning and then starting over the next day is probably a more likely scenario. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=29366.msg325268#msg325268">Quote from: gtgeorgz on July 04, 2012, 05:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Take the MDMA and then as it starts to wear off, take a dose of 2C-B!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting but I suspect I&#039;d be too tired at that point.

				MDMA is a absolutly must have for you for a good party : D <br />Had the best days in my life the last weekend with my 2 bestfriends, and know now everything about them, mentally and physically lol ^-^<br /><br />Weed and Coke sounds also like a lot of fun.<br />Maybe think about 2C-B, too?!?!<br /><br />(But be careful with the alcohol on these days ^-^)

				I&#039;m starting to think that what we should invest in is more MDMA, a bit of cocaine and a bottle of champagne or two.<br /><br />And cigarettes, lots of cigarettes. But that&#039;s a given when using stimulants (since I&#039;m not a huge fan of going out to buy more smokes when I&#039;m high as fuck, if I&#039;ve just smoked weed I&#039;m cool but on stimulants I act and feel waaay too sketchy).
