				So I&#039;m watching CBS Evening News right now and one of their top segments was introduced as &quot;The new designer drug Molly and why it is so dangerous&quot;. I didn&#039;t even know where to start with all their mistakes. I&#039;m waiting for the segment to start to see what other stupidity they have to preach.

				Been hearing people talk about this a lot where I live. &quot;Molly&quot; is now taking a huge hit and people who are none-the-wiser and now looking at it and its users badly here. Its always some bullshit news story with incorrect information that gets people talking and starts rumors.<br /><br />And Electric Zoo doesn&#039;t give a shit about doing toxicology reports because in their eyes its still an illegal drug and they don&#039;t care if they affect the reputation of said drug.<br /><br /><br />
