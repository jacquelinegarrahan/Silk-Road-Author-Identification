				Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering if it doable to get a new identity while being reasonably safe from getting caught?<br />I figured it&#039;s probably near impossible to get it done in a legal way, so that&#039;s why I&#039;m asking here if you guys know a way to do it illegally.<br /><br />I&#039;m not interested in stealing someone&#039;s identity and abusing that for personal gain.<br />I just want to get rid of my college debt and start with a clean slate.<br /><br />Is there any way to get this done?

				Haha, no that&#039;s not the way I would like to do it.<br /><br />But maybe it is possible to create an identity in another country which is less precise with their records and then apply to move to my current country which would give my new identity a new social security that belongs to this country. I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just randomly fantasizing about methods...

				This is also something I am very interested in. If you don&#039;t mind the identity being from another country you may want to contact Health. He has a listing for an Official Government Issued UK Passport. It&#039;ll set you back almost 10 grand though. Quite worth it in my opinion. Ive read in the reviews for his passport listing mostly people who are in part A of the process (it is done in two transactions) but I did see one person that said they traveled from the US to the UK with the passport and it worked. There is also a user named Peach that offers a slightly different approach, they have a listing for Information on how to go about establishing your new identity in the US. Several people state that it is very informative and seems legit but I haven&#039;t read about anyone that has gone through the process and gotten the identity established. Peach does however, also offer IDs verifiable by the police but I have no other information about that particular service. Hope this was helpful!

				Well I don&#039;t have 10 grand anyway. Is it really that hard to do that it will cost me that much money?<br /><br />For some reason I&#039;m surprised why this isn&#039;t just a right. I never chose to be registered, I never gave my permission to anyone. Why isn&#039;t it legal to rollback the decision my parents made for me when I was just born?

Question him intensely is my best advice before you make a move and if you need to check out his responses or what information he provides you about the UK, let me or one of my fellow Brits know as we may call bullshit on his statement as save your ass ;) If my senses weren&#039;t tingling around him, that&#039;d be a good resource.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are absolutely right StExo, I personally haven&#039;t had any contact with Health but given that so far only a single person out of so many that have purchased the passport listing have come forward to say how their entire purchase turned out, it would be a big risk to go in blindly. 10K isnt exactly weekend spending money. Then you also have the finalize early bit to keep you stressed during the whole ordeal so this should be researched and thought through at length. Thank you for your willingness to help out, it is much appreciated!&nbsp; :) If anyone who has dealt with Health on this matter reads this and would like to chime in on their experience, we&#039;d love to hear about it!

				I am currently in conversation with this guy:<br />http://mhlnp64ahfaaz3tf.onion/<br /><br />He says his IDs are virgin IDs (meaning they are not stolen from a dead or alive person). I guess that also means that the ID won&#039;t really exist in the database of the UK government. It will probably just be a material thing, without any legal document backing it up.<br /><br />I guess that&#039;s both a good thing and a bad thing. The good part is that I would probably never have to pay taxes, because the IRS (or whatever it&#039;s called in the UK) doesn&#039;t know I exist. The bad part is that if a bank (or anyone for that matter) decides to check my background I will be in serious trouble.<br /><br />Just now I sent another mail with more questions and pictures which I will post here if I get them.<br />What do you guys think?

I guess it depends on what your need for it is, if it is strictly for travel, it may be of use to you. You must keep in mind however, that if something isn&#039;t right at the airport and you were pulled aside and probed for further information they might request your National Insurance Number (which is like the UK version of a social security number) and I&#039;m guessing this guy won&#039;t be providing that. I am not sure if TSA ever asks for Socials or equivalent but I&#039;d just be pretty paranoid about it. Likewise for work or banking or anything else that would require use of this number, you would probably be denied. $450 is much cheaper than 10k for a genuine document, but it almost sounds a little too affordable. Keep asking him questions about it, no matter how small it may seem, just try to get as much information as possible.
