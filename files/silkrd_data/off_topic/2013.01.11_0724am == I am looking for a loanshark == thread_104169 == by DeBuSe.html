				Please please please, don&#039;t get mixed up with loan sharks. I know money can be hard to come by at times, but if you don&#039;t have the money now, what makes you think you&#039;ll be able to pay loan sharks back. If not to protect yourself, don&#039;t get mixed in with them to protect the ones close to you.

				Loan sharks are so called due to their big teeth and aggressive nature.<br />They eat little fish.<br /><br />The shark will lend you $1000. You will have to pay $1500 back next week. You do not pay and you loose a finger as well as the debt goes up to $2000. You cannot pay this, you lose a hand.<br /><br />Just forget the loan shark and pimp your ass out right now, at least you will get to keep the profits :)<br /><br />Or you will have to suck dick for a dollar with no teeth.
