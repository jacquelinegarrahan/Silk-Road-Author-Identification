				So I was just admiring this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11870.0<br /><br />Russian is complete gibberish to me. But I love to look at it because it kind of resembles latin characters (its a greek alphabet, right?), but I can&#039;t figure out what a single word means based on my knowledge of romance languages.<br /><br />I wish I had the means to travel around and learn a couple of different languages. I think it would be super fucking cool to compose thoughts in a language with a different writing system, with completely different grammar. I do not know why the idea appeals to me though. I think it&#039;s because of the utility. Being able to communicate with millions of new people feels like power to me.<br /><br />Anyway that inspired me to post about language learning. Any of you guys do it?<br /><br />It takes a fuck-ton of brainpower to learn languages from the comfort of your own home, even with a basic understanding in place. I&#039;ve been chipping away at French when the mood strikes ever since I studied it in high school and did a couple college classes. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever become fluent unless I go somewhere where French is actually used and chill for a long time.<br /><br />Livemocha is neat as fuck but I feel like there needs to be more structure in the way you interact with native speakers of other languages. They just kind of throw you two in there with a couple dictionaries and let you figure it out for yourselves.<br /><br />Any of you guys amazing enough to actually get decent at a language without visiting the country? Surely you&#039;ll still be horrible at it, in terms of pronunciation at least, but with a big enough vocabulary you could probably pick it up in no time if dropped into said country.<br /><br />How do you go about doing it? I think I&#039;m about to invest in one of those books that are written side by side in both languages... I want it to be cool, and teach me new things but not let it go over my head. Most of the available titles I see are lame. Any of you guys know where I could get some good books that are English-french side by side? I figure maybe something like Harry Potter would be simple enough for me without being too simple to not suck...<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve studied Latin and Greek while in school, and they were both a pretty mindblowing experience.&nbsp; The grammatical structure in both those languages feels more like a math equation than English grammar.&nbsp; I&#039;ve actually been debating/procrastinating learning Russian, maybe I&#039;ll get around to it these next few weeks.&nbsp; I remember reading one infograph/picture that basically explained how to read Korean.&nbsp; Surprisingly, their letters are more similar in function to our alphabet than to Chinese characters; instead of standing for words or ideas themselves, they stand for sounds.<br /><br />When I was in Central America, my Latin came in handy when trying to speak Spanish, luckily enough. However, I doubt I could live in the Vatican or in Greece at all with my current knowledge.<br /><br />P.S. Russian is a cyrllic (spelling?) language.&nbsp; It looks very similar to Greek, but they share next to nothing when looking at their etymologies.

				I&#039;m currently trying to learn Spanish (very badly). My sister is married to a Spanish guy, so it would be nice to be able to communicate with his family when we visit!...and he has some seriously hot nieces that i&#039;d love to get stuck into, so knowing their language would make it a lot easier! :)<br />
