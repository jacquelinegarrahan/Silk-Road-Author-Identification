				Yep: we&#039;ve all had to do it...knuckle down and study up a bit.&nbsp; Learn how bitcoins work, how to get them here.&nbsp; Next learn how pgp works, set that up...there&#039;s plenty about all of this in the forums.&nbsp; I know it seems overwhelming, but again, we all had to do it...I did, didn&#039;t know shit about any of this...got Tor set up, and got here, and hell, they didn&#039;t even have these separate forums, just had to google around, on bitcoins, but now there is plenty posted.&nbsp; You can buy them easy enough on the main site, but you pay more, and there&#039;s no guarantees, although several people on there--SugarMama comes to mind--have earned good reputations.<br /><br />You want to save money, go offsite, there are also many threads on that...time to start practicing your search skills :)
