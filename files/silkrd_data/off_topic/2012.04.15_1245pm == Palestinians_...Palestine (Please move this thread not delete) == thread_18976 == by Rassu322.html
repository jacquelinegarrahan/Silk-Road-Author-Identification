Plus, regardless of our personal opinions on the situation in the middle east it can only serve to attract even more unneeded/unwanted attention to the community if we were labeled anti-semites and, by extension, terrorists.

				The United States should stop giving foreign aid to Israel. They should stop giving foreign aid all together but nevertheless the Israeli economy is dependent on assistance from American taxpayers, who can&#039;t afford to keep hemorrhaging money, and perhaps they would have to scale back their military excesses if they couldn&#039;t afford it. <br /><br />I realize the Israelis need national security, but what they do in the name of national security is overkill. They never seem to be accountable for collateral damage and they have a sense of entitlement underlying every action they take in the alleged name of national security. It&#039;s the collateral damage, the destruction of property and the killing of children who become martyrs of the Palestinian cause that breeds the resentment which encourages a constant recruitment of new anti Israeli militants, whose efforts elicit firmer measures taken by the I.D.F. against the Palestinians. <br /><br />I think the conflict is indicative of cultural primitivism as there is very little difference between an Israeli and a Palestinian besides their millennial old tribal affiliations.<br /><br />So yeah, U.S should cut foreign aid. Ron Paul 2012!

Israel doesn&#039;t need it, and neither do other recipients of foreign aid, especially Egypt.<br /><br />The Israeli economy is not dependent upon US foreign aid - they don&#039;t get much to begin with, and most of what they do get can only be used to buy US military equipment (in order to boost US exports.) Yeah, Israel will take whatever free money they can get, as would anyone, but overall the bad PR isn&#039;t worth the pittance.

				well its a bit more complicated then you pro-palastines put it.<br /><br />Israel is not perfect. but how can you make peace when the other side says you have no right of existence? that all Israeli kids should die?<br />Israel&#039;s targets are terrorist&#039;s - civilians get hurt sometimes even though we try not to. Hamas target civilians, can you see the difference? probably not because you are blinded.. <br />in 2006 we got more missiles then we sent to Lebanon.<br />not only in gaza kids have ptsd.. i also have ptsd what will you say?<br /><br />all you Europeans history was built on taking over lands.. we where moved around from for generations..<br />and lots of our generations where killed by you Europeans.. so i guess you should be a bit more quite.. because u guys are not that perfect either..<br />which state is the only state in the M/E where it&#039;s ok to be gay? where its okay to get divoreced? its ok to have sex if your not married?<br />israel. when gay muslims run from gaza because they will be killed if they stay there who helps them?<br />who gives Gaza electricity and water? Israel. <br /><br />the problem in Israel is that the young generation(like me) have become used to this situation, we want a change, but the Orthodox-jews that have a lot of power in the government, to much power. 70% of israel population wants to get out of the west bank.<br />u should be more concerned in whats going on in Syria..<br /><br /><br />my solution is just to give lsd to Hamas and Israeli government and then everything will be cool :)
