				Hello guys due to some changing bills made by the minister of education in my country, I will be forced to make a math exam in my course.. to proceed my studies to university.<br /><br />But the things is.. Im not so good at math and i really need to pass this exam.. (but still, i have some good knowledge at math.. but this exam will be hard than the previous, said the minister of education).<br /><br />So after that announcement, i decided that the only option the I have is to cheat on it. Pure and simple cheat.<br /><br />After some research i came to the conclusion that i would need outside help during the exam, like from a math educated friend or a teacher. So im studying how to be successful using this method: http://www.spycheatstuff.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage-ask.tpl&amp;product_id=33&amp;category_id=1&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=55<br /><br />youtube video:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=JnchSQ_gNXI<br /><br />Using this Earpiece Pro&#039;s:<br /><br />Complete 2-Way Covert Cellular Communication Has Never Been This Easy Or Affordable<br />Completely Invisible Magnetic Vibration Receiver Fits In Your Ear Undetected<br />2-Way Voice Communication Via Any Bluetooth Phone or 2-Way Radio<br />Covert Communication With Silent SOS Button<br />Passive Earpiece Receiver Powered By Magnetism<br />Sensitive Microphone<br />Smallest Wireless Headset In The World<br /><br />After seeing the video it seems simple enough to get a good score at the exam, but there&#039;s some harder tasks to do like, <br /><br />-Finding a math teacher/friend (sure i will find someone willing to help)<br />-During the exam simple ways to communicate without have to &quot; talk too much&quot;<br />-What if there&#039;s a bluetooth jammer in the school (almost impossible)<br /><br />Do you guys know of anyone that used this method?<br /><br />Did they use this hardware?<br /><br />lol, Sure I have the balls to use this equipment and the money to buy it, but the things is that there are many gadgets like these.. on ebay.co.uk, individual vendors.. etc and im afraid of getting somehow scammed<br /><br />but these seems guys very professional: http://www.spycheatstuff.com/ (and ship to anywhere in the world).<br /><br />Guys Im asking for your help, to help me to be successful with the cheating on this exam... I will posting updates on how are the things going from time to time, and for sure I will be studying my ass off these 4 months that i have left until the exam. <br /><br />inb4 study harder fag<br />inb4 ur the cancer in our society (ye right, if u had the same education minister of education as I do...) <br /><br />Note: don&#039;t spam the thread plz, i will be making a guide on gathered useful information posted on this thread.<br />

				lol <br /><br />just like the heart is an endocrine gland... oh wait shit, just learned it is. <br /><br />But FOR REAL OP, you need to exert your time and energy into finding a math teacher, and then pay them to TEACH you how to do the math, rather than cheating. Personally I feel you absolutely do not deserve to be at the university anyway if you fraudulently obtain admission and should be ashamed. Cheating has no place in the education system because there are more sincere and dedicated individuals exerting enormous effort to learn the material legitimately and it is complete bullshit cheaters ruin the peoples chances who actually DESERVE the admission.&nbsp; It doesnt even matter if you will never use the math in your field, its the matter of principle. <br /><br />I have studied for literally days upon day upon days for certain tests in neuroscience, biochemistry, microbiology, and organic chem [100+ hours for a single test, in addition to class, lab, work, assignments, studying for other tests, and drugs to do as well :) ] and it infuriates me that I know there are people cheating, and I will not stand for it if I become aware. Whats really sad is most of those students were pre-med and they were cheating! A doctor who cheats through school, that is the kind of health care I want.

				well seeing as this is silk road, a drug related forum instead of homework-helper forum I&#039;m going to give some slightly bad advice.<br /><br />why don&#039;t you order some of those crazy ritalin or adderral (sp?) pills or some meth crush it up into neat piles.<br />break out your subject textbooks.<br />and study for 3 days STRAIGHT whilst tweaked up surviving on nothing but cheap soda, candy and fried snacks?<br /><br />that&#039;ll teach your education minister.
