				I found a pdf that explains how to do that, what kind of equipment and ingredients you need and all the steps and blablabla.<br />However, I don&#039;t have the money yet to set up a lab of my own and practice (and of course fail) a lot of times.<br /><br />But I really want to get into the business. Is there anyone that can and wants to help me? Like teach me the steps? And maybe I can work for you for a couple of weeks/months? It could save you a lot of time. Or if there is any other way you can help me, I&#039;d really like to know.<br />I live in The Netherlands, I&#039;m a 21 year old kid and I will do anything to prove I&#039;m not a cop if you want to help me / teach me.

				ive been researching quite a bit as well on this topic. although its doubtfull that i will ever actually set up shop..<br /><br />you can figure it out on your own, it will just take longer. their are a few complicated reactions that you will have to learn. but before that you must find your chemicals, and your precurser. both are possible to get, but im not familiar with your countrys laws. <br /><br />a few things ive found out in the last few months.<br /><br />-take it slow! do not rush into getting chemicals, lab equipment, sasafrass, slow is fast. u dont want to be sitting in jail wishing u went slower and stayed low key.<br /><br />-dont tell ANYONE what your doing, EVER.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK! we need more people willing to take the plunge! respect :)<br /><br />

				No you don&#039;t, unless you can set up a lab and source chemicals quietly, alone and safely you&#039;re gonna get caught and jailed before you&#039;ve received your first kilo of sassafras oil. <br />No NL lab will take you on as an operator unless you&#039;re a chemical engineer, or at least have a degree in chemistry and good contacts- these are setups where they can churn out 500kg per cycle, you think they&#039;re gonna employ a kid who &#039;found a pdf&#039;? Small labs wouldn&#039;t need a chemist and you&#039;d be playing with fire trying to hook up with anyone- they&#039;d assume you were LE and I&#039;d hate to think what could happen.<br /><br />Running before you can walk is an understatement.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested in it, then study chemistry for it&#039;s own sake, MDMA chemistry isn&#039;t half as interesting as the product :)

				If you live in NL why bother producing it yourself? Place is swamped with quality MDMA<br />Just buy the cheapest yet quality MDMA you can find and refine it through anhydrous methods into awesome MDMA.<br /><br />You wouldn&#039;t want to buy $5k worth of PMK either only to experiment with it ruining batch after batch, might as well start with the cheap stuff then graduate to full production<br /><br /><br />

				If you&#039;re in the NL, I really don&#039;t see the point. You won&#039;t be able to compete with the large criminal gangs that produce it in 10kg+ batches. Also, you really shouldn&#039;t be producing unless you understand the chemistry behind it; that&#039;s how people get hurt. Be safe :)

				Q: How do I make MDMA?<br /><br />A: If you have to ask on a forum you probably shouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />Unless you have a profound University level understanding of Chemistry you should shy away.

However, you definitely do need at least some formal chemistry training. At the very least, you&#039;d need to take all of the organic chemistry classes that are offered at your local/community college, if they have those in your country.(Sorry ignorant American here.) <br /><br />Like other people are saying though, you can&#039;t just read and re-read that PDF and then go start mixing chemicals once you think you know what it means. That&#039;s very dangerous, because no matter what drug you&#039;re synthesizing, you usually need solvents and other chemicals that are very flammable or hazardous, and you need to know what precautions you need to take to prevent bad situations. You need real-life lab experience before you can try anything. Really wanna stress that to you man. Again, without those classes, you really shouldn&#039;t try synthesizing anything. Even at a local college, you&#039;ll learn the basic principles, you&#039;ll get lab experience, and a general feel for performing chemical procedures.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Okay I will do my best to learn everything I need to learn.

				u guys are strait up DOWNERS!!! <br /><br />its not that hard to learn the chemistry, nor is it that unsafe when you are following the precautions you need to. i met a guys who was producing MDMA on his own from age 18-20, until he got busted selling to a customer. <br /><br />a few organic chem classes, a year or so of study, carefull planning and aquisition of chems and your good to go.. <br /><br />dont be so discouraging.. yes its an outlaw buisness but it can and is being done by many little fish that have took the time to learn. its not only a big time gangster run thing.. sheesh guys..

				I understand where you&#039;re coming from, because I had very similar views once.<br /><br />Carefully read The Wealth of Nations (the first volume will be fine, the others are largely about now esoteric stuff unrelated to our circumstances today e.g. The Corn Laws).<br /><br />For extra credit, read a book called &quot;The Birth of Plenty&quot;.<br /><br />In Science, we pride ourselves on finding solutions to problems. However the critical thing in Science, is not usually some genius solution to a problem, but asking the right kinds of questions. You really want to be sure you&#039;re asking the right questions if you want to change the world.<br /><br />In my view world GDP has dramatically increased in an extremely short space of time. If you google Hans Rosling and Angus Maddison you&#039;ll find the statistics that back up this view. The levels of wealth we have experienced in the world today, are highly abnormal by historical standards. If you do not understand the wealth creation mechanism that enabled this to occur, then you are quite frankly wasting your time trying to fix anything. Even Karl Marx said as much in Das Kapital, which is why it&#039;s a pity that most so-called communists haven&#039;t even read their primary source material.<br /><br />RBE is not a new idea. It is actually a very old idea indeed. In fact, if you do your research you&#039;ll find it actually predates capitalism. RBE in its currently most relevant and easily recognized form had its origin with something called the &quot;Technocracy movement&quot;. Google this to find out more information.<br /><br />Lastly, do read those two books I mentioned. It&#039;s next to impossible to have a coherent discussion on these matters if the two parties don&#039;t even agree on fundamentals such as the basic economic history of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. <br /><br />I mean, having a &#039;view&#039; or &#039;perspective&#039; is one thing, but you can&#039;t argue with &quot;X tonnes of steel were manufactured in 1906&quot;, since that is simply an historical fact. Unfortunately in these discussions, with all due respect, proponents of RBE are frequently unaware of precisely these kinds of facts. I don&#039;t mean to be condescending, it&#039;s just true.

But as long as you can follow instructions, you can synthesize anything that has already been synthesized and documented by &quot;real&quot; chemists.

Even in the US though it is not illegal to buy or possess. The way the laws are worded is so that they need to prove that you had intent to manufacture an illegal substance.<br /><br />The greatest tool for control is fear, and so that is what the DEA&#039;s &quot;List 1&quot; of precursors is. It&#039;s just their way is stopping legitimate businesses from selling certain chemicals, and it works. The answer is pretty simple though; don&#039;t do business with domestic companies. Or at the very least, don&#039;t give your money to any company that supports the DEA or other corrupt government agencies.

				300mg average dose.&nbsp; Above recipe nets about 50g. Reagent costs and time ballpark to about $200.<br />166 doses at about $4-5 (conservative price per dose)<br /><br />~$750 per cook, 500 profit. I know many would pay twice twice that per dose however. The best part is not having to fuck around looking for saffrole or anhydrous acetic acid.
