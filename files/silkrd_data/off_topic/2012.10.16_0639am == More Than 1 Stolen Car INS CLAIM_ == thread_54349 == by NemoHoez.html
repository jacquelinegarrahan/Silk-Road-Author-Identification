				Hello everybody, I could not think of a better place to ask such a question. Is it suspicious if it is within 2 year and at the same location? If this is not the place to ask please point me in the right direction. 2 stolen car claims same location within 3 years. 1st one was never found.

				I think it may depend on what you mean by same location. Were they both in the same part of town, or literally in the exact same spot as each other? Regardless, if your car is stolen, you should definitely report it. <br /><br />On the other hand, your insurance could see you as a high risk client and drop you.<br /><br />sdesu

				Well it depends, would the same exact location be best? There has been multiple cars stolen on the street. I was just wondering if the INS would see this as a red flag. I know of people who have more than 1 stolen car claim from the same location. I&#039;m just hesitant this time around, and want to cover all bases.&nbsp; Thanks for y0ur reply.

				I dont know where you are but I know what you have in mind!&nbsp; ;) ;)<br /><br />If the first time it happened the car was in your name and now again its gonna happen and again in your name = a big NONO!!!<br /><br />The scam works once no problem,try a second time tho and your gonna have MAD investigations the type with big deep wallets that dont like being scammed!!!<br /><br />If you want to run this scam you need to find new buyers for each car... also I would recommend using different insurance companies.<br /><br />

				Damn :(. Oh well, i was just seeing $$$. I just figured since there has been multiple cars stolen from this street, it wouldn&#039;t be as obvious. But you are right, the last thing I need is somebody digging up some stuff or asking the neighbors about it. I have a person that does a great job down south, and he just needs a couple days. I guess I will just stick it out then. Thanks for your very helpful reply.

				LOL.. im sure you were seeing them $$$$ but once is enough.. dont get greedy.<br /><br />All in all I&#039;m sure if you have some ppl to work with you&#039;ll make some serious coin with them kind of scams especially with replacement value insurance.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />

				Ya, do that in the same spot and you guarantee yourself a visit by a &quot;special investigator&quot;<br /><br />2 thefts within less than 5 years is an automatic red flag with any insurer. Add the same location and you got a crosshair on your brow. Even if they won&#039;t necessarily assume foul play on your end, they will at least try to check out if they can deny the claim for &quot;negligence&quot; or anything like that.
