				I come to the forums seeking my last hope for completing my college course<br />ive tried using the clearnet essay writers but i think the extent of their knowledge on computers stops at scrolling through pictures wanking and dribbling then finally establishing with me they cant do it.<br />If any lovely person on here would be willing to write a VERY simple visual basic program for me i will be eternally grateful and send bc directly to your wallet,<br /><br />inbox me for details on what the program needs to do<br />

				While I think visual basic is a complete waste of time and space, I fully appreciate the shitty situation of college programming courses being a joke.&nbsp; No promises, absolutely at all, but feel free to explain more and I might be able to lend a few minutes on break
