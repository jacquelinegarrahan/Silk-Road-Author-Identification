				Im a college student who decided to start selling the amazing wonders i get on SR at my school.&nbsp; The bangin mdma I sold got all the frat boys jealous causing the queen bitch girlfriend of one to get me kicked out of my sorority.&nbsp; Most still bought from me which i found hysterical, but now I got so many people enlightened by Tess&#039; tabs.&nbsp; People hit me up left and right for these things and it got to the point where ppl dont even bother asking for deals because this shits so good.&nbsp; Well anyways, I log on to SR for the first time since I came back from Camp Bisco to find out Tess has no listings.... TESS HAS NO LISTINGS!&nbsp; Oh man i cant describe the disappointment in my big heart that Im experiencing... <br /><br />I only have 7 tabs left and someones already harassing me for them... I want to sell them so these kids can experience the wonders of em, but what about my needs too?&nbsp; And all those people going to electric adventure, and to see infected mushroom, then to ezoo!!!

				I dunno... yea you paid $315 for 25 of tabs but your basically getting 50 tabs for 315 since theyr double... I doubt anyone has better and all these venders on SR that sell 100mcg tabs sell them for more than $10 a tab... <br /><br />I know Tess will pull through, I just hope soon enough before the end of summer.&nbsp; No one wants to trip during school.. Aint no body got time for that!

				Based on the title i thought you had a CD...<br /><br />If i were you, tell the frat boys tough luck and keep em to trip yourself and with your close friends, MDMA will make you plenty on its own.

				Whose OP?<br /><br />I am a girl and i did find a guy to sell for me lol. He does all my leg work and i never have to speak or see who buys my products.&nbsp; Everyone thinks he is the bearer of good drugs from someone in his hometown, not directly down the street.&nbsp; I never do transactions on my own unless its though him or at festivals (where if your smart you wont get busted or in my hotel room).<br /><br />Currently at the time I have NO DRUGS.&nbsp; Well I have 2 1/8th of shrooms which a friend and i are eating at electric adventure.&nbsp; 9 caps of .2 each of JoRs mediocre mdma which im saving for electric adventure and to see Infected mushroom (cant sell em cuz im gonna need all that mdma to get me going those 2 days) aaaand the 7 tabs I have left that I dunno what im gonna do with.&nbsp; I have prob around 3.5 grams of bud that Id love to get rid of cuz I have 3.5 grams of really good wax to go with my awesome micro g pens.&nbsp; So i think Im in the clear, but if you have any suggestions or see any loopholes, all suggestions on helping me smarten up are welcomed =)<br /><br /><br />And as for the mdma, I dunno why i need so much to get me rolling, I dont roll often and people speak so highly of JoRs stuff... oh well every body is diff i guess

				Yea i guess i did exaggerate just a bit there.&nbsp; The one dude who hit me up found out about my stuff from Bisco... And shit your right.&nbsp; Tess running out of product is probably a god send for me.&nbsp; I should forget about drugs for now, just have fun for myself and hold off on the selling.&nbsp; Might as well stop while im still super fucking ahead right!&nbsp; Next semester im not dorming nor living around campus, Im gonna commute, and Ill be the queen of the fucking dumbfuck brain dead retards if I commute to school everyday with drugs on me.&nbsp; Any amount can land me behind bars and all ill have to say is goodbye $145,000 bachelors degree in engineering im trying to get.&nbsp; Im so thankful for this forum. =)
