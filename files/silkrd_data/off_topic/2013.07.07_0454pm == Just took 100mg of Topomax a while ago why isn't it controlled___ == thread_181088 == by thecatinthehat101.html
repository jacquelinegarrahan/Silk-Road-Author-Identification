				Well I took 100mg or Topamax a bit ago and I&#039;m not sure if my brain is play tricks on me or if its working. I feel dreamy, like lost in thought and I&#039;m starting to get distracted easily, find myself gazing off at the tv. <br /><br />Searched the internet could not find much about it or the affects of topamax does anyone know???

				Idk I can&#039;t find much on it. Just that it acts like a benzo and is abusable I guess.

				Ah, Topamax. <br />It can make one a) stupid, b) forgetful, c) not-hungry, d) forgetful, e) migraine-free (for some people), f)&nbsp; seizure-free, in really epic doses that no human being can tolerate, apparently, g) predisposed towards metabolic acidosis, h) prone to kidney stones, i) prone to paraphasias, j) did I mention stupid?<br />Oh, also, heat intolerance and inability to sweat. I guess that matters in the summer.<br /><br />Crazymeds used to have good information on it, I haven&#039;t checked over there in a while, check them out... ah. Linked below.<br />&nbsp;You may thank that forum for the classic description of how one knows when the effective dose is reached: &quot;It makes soda taste like ass.&quot; [Yes, in fact, it does.]<br />Link to mech of action from their page is below.<br /><br />Most everyone loses weight on it. Some to the point of concern.<br />Affectionately called &quot;Dopamax&quot; by those who know it. (The joke is that people lose weight on it because they&#039;re too fucking stupid to find food. I wish that were an exaggeration, but, having become lost on the way to the grocery store while taking it...)<br /><br />Amazingly, it&#039;s been approved in combination with phentermine for weight loss in the US. Unbelievable. <br /><br />It does have some intriguing off-label utility for compulsive disorders - binge-type behaviors, in particular - cutting, gambling, binge-type drinking, binge-eating, and for OCD. Maybe a role for sensory integration in autistic spectrum disorders; not sure, I am underwhelmed by what I&#039;ve read and observed.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a basic link on mechanism of action: http://www.crazymeds.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Meds/HowTopamaxWorks<br /><br />If you like topiramate you may LOVE Zonegran... I guess.<br />

				Wow Thyme your one smart chick or dude thank you for that. I&#039;m on phertermine today lol. Kinda reminds me of adderall but not nearly as abusable or euphoric. It does do something though!

				Phentermine? yes, it does things :) - as you say, kind of like adderall but not as abusable or euphoric.<br /><br />IIRC, topiramate in combination with phentermine is one of the weight loss combination pills (the other was/will be topiramate plus bupropion.)<br /><br /><br />
