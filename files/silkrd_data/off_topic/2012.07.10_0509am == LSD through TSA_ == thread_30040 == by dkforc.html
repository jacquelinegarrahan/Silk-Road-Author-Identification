				If one wanted to take a few LSD tabs on a plane, would it be better to do so on one&#039;s person, in a carryon, or in checked luggage? Would an LSD tab show up a different color on the x-ray machine?<br /><br />If so, I suppose it&#039;d be easy to wrap it in plastic and put it at the bottom of one&#039;s sock...

				the possibilities of hiding something so small with no scent, are limitless.<br /><br />Personally, i&#039;d put it in my wallet pressed between to hard plastic cards, or do as you suggest, wrap it in some plastic and stick it in your sock<br /><br />( make sure the plastic lays flat, dont want it to look like a bulge popping out of your sock )<br /><br />Or!, you could just eat it before you get on the plane! XD I&#039;ve always wanted to trip balls on a plane.

				I&#039;ve brought lots of stuff on planes. I even know personally (though not very well) a TSA agent who told me straight up they don&#039;t give a shit about drugs unless you make it so obvious they have to arrest you. Just don&#039;t give them an excuse. I&#039;ve had MDMA capsules in vitamin bottles, an oz of weed with multiple vacuum seals folded into my clothing/ pockets, and pure xanax powder in a tiny bag in my wallet. As long as your acid doesn&#039;t smell like TNT or look like a Glock going through the scanner, you should be fine with even minimal precautions. Don&#039;t go in thinking its fool-proof; it isn&#039;t. But anyone of reasonable intelligence should be able to get as much personal use, and even a little bulk, on board a plane. Then there is always your asshole or vagina... nature&#039;s stash spot.

				If you have a cell phone, i&#039;d recommend slipping it under where the battery is slipped in. It should fit snugly, and not over heat the product if you keep the phone off, and kept in your baggage.

				TSA really doesn&#039;t give 2 shits, they only say something if, like PharmerJohn said, you make it painfully obvious because it&#039;s their job and they do not wish to get fired. I got stopped once for some weed but they just told me &#039;Hide it better next time&#039; and put it back in my bag before I boarded, granted it was only about a gram but most of the employees themselves do something lol.

				The guy was cool as shit lol, he was askin me all sortsa dumb shit cuz he found a box of blunts too lol. Had about a 10min convo with him about weed (it&#039;s decriminalized for the most part where I am), he was just like oh shit my bad lol. I remember him saying something along the lines of like &quot;yo you&#039;re lucky I checked your bag and not that bitch over there, she&#039;s a straight up cunt and my boss&quot; XD

				That&#039;s hillarious!, And cool as fuck. I&#039;d love to get that lucky, but i have shit luck. But being pretty much de-criminalized in your area, thats even luckier.<br />I cant wait till the november ballot for Oregons Tax Act goes through. Gonna move there and get a legitimate job in the cannabis industry.

				It&#039;s good and bad, some cops refuse to let shit go and you&#039;ll still get a pretty hefty ticket (was caught with .5g, received 275$ ticket -_-&quot;), and others will either laugh and let you keep it, or throw it in the trash and no ticket etc. Surprisingly, a lot of the older cops tend to be the ones who don&#039;t give a shit as well as the young ones, but the middle aged guys seem to be the total douches. I&#039;ve always wanted to work in/own a dispensary, however it won&#039;t be possible for quite some time and I could do without threats from leo (they threaten all the headshop owners around here enuff, can only imagine what would happen to a dispensary)

				Having worked in an airport, I can say it&#039;s extraordinarily easy to smuggle small amounts of drugs for personal use. The airlines I worked at didn&#039;t even drug test, all they did was get your fingerprints to check for past crimes and that&#039;s it. I went out to the parking lot every single day to smoke pot and was caught so many times by stewardesses/pilots walking out to their cars but literally no one gave a shit. Me and my mates brought cocaine, blotters of various kind, MDMA, boomers, meth, bud, literally just about every popular drug past TSA on a near weekly basis and nothing bad ever came of it. This girl I became friends with before quitting even told me she accidentally left a few grams of weed in her purse which went through the xray scanners but they didn&#039;t even notice! :o It scared her to death but they really didn&#039;t give a shit.<br /><br />Don&#039;t even get me started on the people that worked there though, recovering meth and heroin addicts, coke heads, stoners, hippies so burned out from acid they can&#039;t have a normal conversation, it was insane! ;D

				The only thing that would get you caught is you.&nbsp; Take a beta blocker........zero racing heart or &quot;suspicious behavior&quot;&nbsp; <br />Ask you doctor if propanolol is right for you......tell them you get stage fright or something.
