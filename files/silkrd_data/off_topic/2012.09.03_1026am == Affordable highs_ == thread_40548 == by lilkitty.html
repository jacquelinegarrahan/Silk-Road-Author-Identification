				buy a couple packs of panadeine extra and do a cold water extraction to get the codeine out and drink the horrible tasting water/codeine mix.<br />with an antihistamine ofcourse- phernergan <br />cost about $20 and takes about 1/2 hour min.<br /><br />B

				Best bang for the buck is still amphetamine sulphate imo, mixes very nice with valium and/or weed. Its cheaper then going out for beers all nite<br />

				I&#039;d consider taking alcohol with valium more as a low then a high though ;)<br /><br />If you are interested i&#039;d be happy to trade your valium for some pot...

				A gram of MXE for $25. A 15-20mg dose feels like being drunk, but way better. So that&#039;s 66 doses that last 3 hours for $0.37 a dose.

				Thanks all!<br />The suggestions so far are:<br /><br />1-Codien<br />2-amphetamine<br />3-Weed<br />4- MXE.<br /><br /><br />Number 2 and 4 I&#039;ve never tried &amp; will surely consider! .. thank you so much<br /><br />oh yes, Beaner, can you please explain the water extraction method?<br /><br />Ben,<br />lol no sorry mate. Not a big smoking fan!<br />I like things I can snort, IV, or take orally. <br /><br />What I mean by affordable?<br />Not superrrrr expensive, so if you like it too much and developed a tolerance you can still achieve to get it.<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;Would be even better if you guys can recommend something we can trick doctors to give us!!<br /><br />I have: depression<br />Anxiety<br />Back injury..<br /><br />and still have to cry and BEG for weak shitty meds :( <br /><br />What is wrong with doctors nowadays????<br /><br /><br />I live in Australia. I&#039;d appreciate it if anyone can guide me to the right method of doctor shopping. I have diagnosis/reports with me. <br /><br /><br />...................<br />Anyways, Just took couple of Tramadol, Valium and alcohol... and feeling so sleepy!<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you know how it goes. :)

				Well, pot does not have to be smoked to be effective. You can eat it and end up with similar results, although they will likely take quite some time before you notice them.<br /><br />As for the problem you suffer from, you&#039;ll probably be best off with medication for both. This could include something like tramadol for the pain and xanax for the anxiety, which may be an interesting experience if used at the same time (i never have). <br /><br />I suppose a warning is in order though, as mentioned the combination of alcohol and benzo&#039;s, while synergetic in hyptnotic effect, can be very dangerous. Considering how many people do this anyway and are perfectly fine, the practical risk probably isn&#039;t that large. One downside i found about it is that it can give you complete anterograde amnesia, which can be quite alarming to some. This already happens at relatively small doses, larger doses of the combination will put you at risk for more severe effects like respiratory depression that can eventually result in death. <br /><br />Many sedatives have this problem though. Alcohol alone can put you in a coma for a couple of days if taken rapidly in large amounts. One way to limit this risk is by not drinking spirits straight, but limiting yourself to beer, wine or mix drinks with similar alcohol content. This will not reduce the effects of equal doses, but it does provide the benefit that you are more likely to fall asleep spilling your last glass instead of just passing out with no idea of when(/if?) you&#039;ll come to.

				Hello Kitty,<br /><br />have you considered growing your own weed or shrooms ?<br /><br />plus, if you want to stay on the healthy side, better avoid Benzos and Amphetamines, their side effects and addiction potential is just too high.

				Well, its not like pot doesnt have such risks because its a &#039;natural&#039; product. I&#039;d just say &quot;so is opium&quot; to be done with that ;)
