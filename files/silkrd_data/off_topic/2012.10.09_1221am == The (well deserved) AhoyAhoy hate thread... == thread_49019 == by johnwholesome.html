				Sooo,<br /><br />I have been watching all these Limitless this, Limitless that threads, and I take exception with Limitless hogging all the hate in here for himself so selfishly.<br /><br />Hence I put forward, for your consideration, another member that deserves some hate: AhoyAhoy.<br /><br />The man comes in swinging around his big black schlong, spewing assorted insults and aggravating statements in fine style, yet he is getting none of the well deserved hate he is working for so hard!<br /><br />What is wrong with you people?!?! Have you all no decency???<br /><br />Now be a good darkweb denizen and stop withholding some well-deserved hate from the man! Noone likes to contribute insult and mockery and not get anything in return because some mod hoggs all the hate for himself, it&#039;s an outrage!!!<br /><br />It&#039;s okay AhoyAhoy, never mind them imbeciles! We hate you too!<br /><br />JW

				Some say he&#039;s a blight on humanity, and that calling him an &quot;attention whore&quot; is an insult to attention whores. All we know is, he&#039;s called Ahoyhoy.<br /><br /><br />/I almost started this thread yesterday, but I honestly didn&#039;t know how you&#039;d take it, Ahoyhoy. You did ask for this thread though. Happy now!?
