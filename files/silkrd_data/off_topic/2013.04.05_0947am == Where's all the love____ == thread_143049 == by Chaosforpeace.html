				Come on guys. We&#039;r a community and we are all alike in some way or another. We as members of The road need to stick together and help eachother out. <br />Do away with the negative. If some noob asks a stupid noobish question don&#039;t make fun of him help him out.<br />Why must there be negativity and hatred in the most amazing place that exits?

				We got crazy love for the community. Life was different before SR, recreational drug taking was a lot more dangerous.<br /><br />Thank you DPR, Vendors and Buyers for making this happen. If only we weren&#039;t all anonymous we could get together and party over the revolution before us.<br /><br />Note to LE: Love for you too, but if you really want to help people consider a career change because what we&#039;re a part of here is a HARM REDUCTION system...<br /><br />Blessings to all our brothers and sisters,<br />AUS-SmartDrugs

This is usually because they are the same people correctly answering others and they earned the stripes to do so based on searching, reading and experience, as opposed to continually asking to be spoonfed.<br /><br />&quot;I can&#039;t be arsed to use the search function because it&#039;s slow&quot; was basically the attitude of many new folks when we took a break a few months back. Fuck - if this was Fight Club, Tyler would have kicked the shit out of us all and barred us for some of the attitudes and egos displayed.<br /><br />

I get called out over and over again in different threads. Just because I want to make the drugs everyone loves easier to get and safer. A person on here can believe me or not, why does it matter? Why does everyone have to be a dick to the guy trying to be nice. And why even say anything, if I don&#039;t open my account than say whatever you want, but it doesn&#039;t make sense a month before opening to have everyone shit all over me.<br />Whenever someone starts to hate on me I usually start making jokes to show the person how stupid it is to get so angry.<br /><br />Either way I love everyone on the road, the only reason Im feeling right now is because I popped 400mgs mdma last night and after slept for 3 hours. My happiness is a little drained right now.<br /><br />Peace and much love

How would you know who gave you bad karma without being admin? Why would you even think that?<br /><br />You can&#039;t jump to conclusions and accuse someone of negging you just on a hunch. If you know for sure that&#039;s different, but you don&#039;t know. You didn&#039;t even give a reason. Do not do this again.

I get called out over and over again in different threads. Just because I want to make the drugs everyone loves easier to get and safer. A person on here can believe me or not, why does it matter? Why does everyone have to be a dick to the guy trying to be nice. And why even say anything, if I don&#039;t open my account than say whatever you want, but it doesn&#039;t make sense a month before opening to have everyone shit all over me.<br />Whenever someone starts to hate on me I usually start making jokes to show the person how stupid it is to get so angry.<br /><br />Either way I love everyone on the road, the only reason Im feeling right now is because I popped 400mgs mdma last night and after slept for 3 hours. My happiness is a little drained right now.<br /><br />Peace and much love<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For starters, nice thread you started here Chaosforpeace. We could probably use something like this. I&#039;m sorry some lonely people popped in to try to ruin it. If it&#039;s any consolation, they don&#039;t really have a proper acc./ as they can&#039;t even fully utilise it. When they say something, they are negged, and if they want help with an issue, they are ignored. This is worse than being in the newbie section as at least with that section, you are not ostracized. <br /><br />Welcome to Silk Road vending! :) Sorry to hear you have been given a hard time by announcing this. Good luck with this new venture and hope to see you when you set up. :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
