				Apologies for the double posting, I don&#039;t know what section fits this best and I think its pretty serious.<br />Ive just had a BIG issue with Franks MDMA and hes not replying to messages. <br /><br />Bought 100g of what was supposedly high quality MDMA to resell out at a festival, What has arrived so far is 75g of&nbsp; a brown semi-crystalline powder, only one bag has been opened, I sold 20g´s.&nbsp; Of those 3 people were sick throwing up the whole night and the rest said it had little / no effect. Had to refund everyone... Ive found out from other people that were willing to risk it that&nbsp; they´re having to do upwards of 1/2g to even get remotely high.&nbsp; &nbsp;it has a sweet kind of taste, very strange. <br /><br />Franks´s not answering my messages, but It really looks to be a bad batch of MDMA, if that and could be potentially dangerous. I don´t know if the sick people were maybe made ill because they were allergic to something used to cut the substance...<br /><br />I´ve ordered small orders of frank loads of times with no problems, but now hes not answering my messages.and with the new FE policy I obligingly FE´d....&nbsp; Please be aware with his new&nbsp; MDMA listings. <br /><br />I am willing to send out samples to people that are able to test <br />ACE<br />

How long did they stay sick? Would you say he purposefully put something in there to make people sick, or just synth&#039;d something wrong. Are you even sure it is actual MDMA at this point? I mean it has to be cut from something....<br /><br />Also some other factors to consider, unlikely may they be.... <br />Did they all eat at the same place/same food?<br />Did they ingest any other drugs together?<br /><br />Could possibly be something else we aren&#039;t seeing but who knows.<br /><br />For me personally I would explain to them the mishap, I mean they were taking drugs sold on the street even though they came from SR. So they have to take into account that things like this are very possible to happen with any drug that you don&#039;t know the background of, even batch specific...<br /><br />Just give them the next legit verified batch on the house, recreational amount of course, and let them roll their balls off. They will forget about all this and bussiness will commence as normal!<br /><br />Hope I could help fuckingACE. Will check back in here!<br /><br />-W0

				Sounds like methylone to me. I can take pics and try a little and tell what I experience if you want. Yea M1 has similair effects at a much higher dose and no effects at all if there&#039;s the least bit of a tolerance issue. I have no test kit either. There&#039;s gota be somebody willing to waste some of their test kit for ya.

I rely on feedback and the sellers rating to judge weather the product is good or not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes... because the people who review drugs on this site are renown for both their honesty and accuracy ::).<br /><br />Marquis test is $20-$50, package comes in, open, use tip of knife to get a tiny bit of product, put it in marquis solution.&nbsp; 20 seconds tops.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know how much 100g of MDMA cost you(can&#039;t connect to SR at the moment to check frank&#039;s listings) but I&#039;m assuming it&#039;d be at least 4k, I think a 4k investment is worth 20 seconds of testing...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Perhaps its my ignorance. but each 100g package is split into 25 g parcels, I received speed MDMA, trips, Nbome, 2cb amongst other things... in total everything I have ordered totals 64 packages. <br /><br />So 64 x 20 -50 dollars, you expect me to spend between 1280 dollars and 3200 dollars on tests? and invest the time in opening and sampling each one. so I have to spend 2k on top of what is already a high price for the drugs just to check they&#039;re ok? put yourself in my position, would you really order 2k woth of test kits to reverify information that is apparently correct on the previous fb

				Yes, it is your ignorance.&nbsp; A single vial will last roughly 100 tests.&nbsp; From your post I can only assume that you have never tested any product you have sold with any sort of testing kit, I&#039;d highly suggest doing so.<br /><br />Additionally, despite the shipment being sent in 4 parcels, you can pretty much assume that they are from the same batch(unless one has a markedly different appearance) so you would only need to do 1 test per order.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to flame you, I just think safety is underrated.

				Guys... Guys...<br /><br />Fractal: Ace is not being a dishonest vendor here, you have to sympathize from his point of view... Him and his team move a lot of product and at a lot of different varieties. Testing everyone of them would be damn near impossible...&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just as much our responsibility as a buyer to test the product just as much as it is the vendors....<br /><br />I mean at least he is being honest here and calling to others for help, also pointing out the dishonest vendor mentioned in OP...<br /><br />Ace: I feel you here mate, Im sure it is hard to manage all this shit and I am also sure when someone facks you over on a 100g pack it&#039;s pretty frustrating. But as I told fractal, sympathize with his point of view... When you are moving out&nbsp; large shipment I do think it is necessary to run the basic test on it... I know it is a lot to ask for someone moving so much weight but it would prevent shit like this from happening. I know for a fact you aren&#039;t the only vendor sending out shit (real or bunk) that they don&#039;t test so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to single you out, especially since you are here actually asking for help... &amp; not just selling the rest of the 100g pack to randoms.. Kudos to you

				I&#039;m glad to see a vendor that has had to deal with this (not that I want anyone to have to deal with this kind of nonsense) instead of the average joe shmoe. A lot of the smaller guys that make these kind of claims get looked over but thankfully ACE is taking this seriously, for the benefit of us all. Hopefully we can get the MDMA section sorted out, because as of late it&#039;s getting pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />Thanks ACE

				Yeah, re-reading my post several hours later, I realise that I worded it poorly and the tone was not the one I had intended.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t trying to attack you or call you an inadequate vendor fuckingACE,&nbsp; I have never been a street vendor, nor an SR vendor, the most I&#039;ve sold is a couple grams of MDMA and maybe 3-4 grams of DMT that I had extracted/synthed myself.&nbsp; I guess I got a bit incredulous finding that you didn&#039;t know of the testing kits(and therefore their quantity etc.) but for all I know, perhaps most popular vendors on the road don&#039;t test their product before selling.<br /><br />

				By the same logic every single buyers should buy a test kit and/or send every drug they get to a testing lab. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever opened a bottle of aspirin and started &quot;testing&quot; it, I generally trust the thousands of other people that have taken it aswell (much like SR). I personally know the way my drug is supposed to taste/look/smell/react so I don&#039;t want to order drug testing equipment to my home on a registered clearnet site. I thought TSC mostly dealt with THC/opium products anyway... why would you need to buy test kits to test hash?

				Hello everyone, ACE sent me a sample of this to test and it appears to be real mdma based on taste, mecke &amp; simons tests (I ran out of marquis).<br /><br />Smell: Like mdma but a little different from what I&#039;ve had, couldn&#039;t really put a word to it. I feel like I&#039;ve smelled exactly this before but I&#039;m not sure where.<br />Look: White, almost powdery/clumped which combined with the smell made me think it wasn&#039;t mdma when I first opened it but I might just be biased due to preconceived notions.<br />Taste: I compared it side by side with a verified batch of my own mdma and they are the same.<br />Reagent tests: Mecke &amp; Simons came back showing the correct black &amp; blue colors.<br /><br />Pics:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/b7e.jpg<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/b7m.jpg<br /><br />While I&#039;m here I&#039;d like to say the packaging he used was very professional. I was a tad drunk when I sent my shipping info and had forgotten that it would be arriving so I was confused about why I had mail from Spain until I opened it up.
