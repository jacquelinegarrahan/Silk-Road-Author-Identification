				I sure have.. Datura strammonium.<br /><br />My first few attempts were from mild teas brewed from the flowers and leaves.&nbsp; This method had minimal effects.&nbsp; As the weight of foliage and time spent brewing increased, the effects were more noticeable but still weren&#039;t enough to cross the threshold.&nbsp; Lots of uncomfortable feelings, dilated pupils, dry mouth, seeing things move in the corner of your eyes, etc.<br /><br />I then began tampering with the seeds.&nbsp; My first few attempts were with a few seeds (again, minimal effects).&nbsp; So, I dove in and tried a dose of 50 seeds which was more like a mild dose of Diphenhydramine.&nbsp; The world took upon a dark aura, things began wiggling, entities seemed to emerge from the shadows, and there were light small hallucinations (like bugs on the floor and spiderwebs hanging across the room).&nbsp; Heart palpitations and anxiety ensued.<br /><br />My last experience of 200 seeds consisted of 24 hours of true hallucinations and mental illness and another 24 hours of blurred vision and trying to recover from what had happened.&nbsp; I ingested them, felt fine, and assumed things were on the slow road again.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t seem to feel anything at all (excluding the normal dilated pupils, darkness, and extreme dry mouth)--my trip partner didn&#039;t notice the effects either, said goodbye, and left me to go to bed.&nbsp; I ended up driving home (do not do this!) as I thought the tolerance from the previous 50 seeds a couple nights prior had kept me from feeling anything.&nbsp; Little did I know..&nbsp; I was higher than I have ever been in my life and didn&#039;t realize it.&nbsp; There was someone in the car with me (in reality, I was alone).&nbsp; I made it home and there were tons of people in my house (mind you, it was 2am and we had no visitors).&nbsp; They were grabbing snacks and chatting.&nbsp; My brother was sitting on the edge of the couch and I had a complete conversation with him (he lives far away and doesn&#039;t come visit).&nbsp; I retreated upstairs and saw my sister and a group of her friends watching TV (my sister wasn&#039;t home and no friends were there).&nbsp; There was a legit alien among them and it kept sticking its tongue in my sister&#039;s ear.&nbsp; This frightened me.&nbsp; I still had no idea I was hallucinating.&nbsp; I put my wallet down and little dark-skinned gremlins grabbed it, climbed up my dresser, and started rummaging through it.&nbsp; I rushed over to take it back and was looking through it to see what they had taken.&nbsp; I pulled out my ID and then the wallet and ID both vanished.&nbsp; The &quot;phantom&quot; items illusion occured many times throughout the night with different objects such as my wallet, people, cigarettes, a bottle of cough syrup, my phone, and keys (many reports from users on deliriants, such as Diphenhydramine and Datura, talk on this &quot;phantom cigarette phenomenon&quot;).&nbsp; It happens and is often times frustrating as you&#039;re spending time looking for an object that doesn&#039;t exist and you don&#039;t yet realize that it doesn&#039;t exist (you just eventually get distracted by another phantom object or thought).&nbsp; None of this seemed out of place.&nbsp; Throughout the night many of my friends appeared.&nbsp; Some talked to me, bust most just curled up in my bed and ignored me.&nbsp; They would vanish.. like literally fade out of sight and I truly believed that they were teleporting away because they were mad at me.&nbsp; I laid in bed and saw eyes from the corner of my room.&nbsp; I could hear people whispering and assumed they were saying negative things about me.&nbsp; It made me upset and I tried so hard to make out what they were saying.&nbsp; Throughout the night, a lot of difference voices projected themselves in my mind.<br />...there&#039;s much more to that trip report (I can find the official writeup on my computer this weekend and paste it if anyone is interested).&nbsp; In the end, my parents got involved because I was acting so insane.<br /><br />Anywho, I tell you this as it&#039;s an amazing experience and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; I learned a lot about myself, the universe, hallucinations, my mind, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />PLEASE, start with super low dosages and work your way up over a longer period of time than I did; I request this as each plant&#039;s alkaloid content is different (I used the same plant for all of my experiences) and overdosing is lethal and easy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, HAVE A SOBER TRIP SITTER.&nbsp; If you break through the membrane, you no longer realize that you are intoxicated (ie, schizophrenic thoughts).&nbsp; It&#039;s literally like having a mental illness.&nbsp; You will have true hallucinations, your mind will not be capable of making rational decisions, and you could end up hurting yourself or others.<br /><br />I have not tried it since, though I have felt the urge.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have anyone I trust enough to trip sit me in such a state.&nbsp; When that person offers themselves, I will surely take them up and squeeze my way back through the membrane.

				Thanks for that. Yes, I would be interested in reading the full trip report. I want to know more about the nature of the hallucinations.

				Awesome!&nbsp; I&#039;m glad to have stumbled upon someone who is interested.<br /><br />The full report is on my computer at home which I will have access to this weekend (I&#039;m currently on Spring break).<br /><br />If you decide to dose in the meantime, be safe, please!

				I tried Datura about 10 years ago, researched the fuck out of it. Datura Stramonium grows wild all over the place in my area, so I have a few thousand seeds in a big baggie.<br /><br />I will never ingest it again in my life. I just didn&#039;t find it fun or recreational at all. Good luck trying to see anything for the week after you take it too, it fucks with your eyesight.

				Research of this sacred plant will surely pay off in the long run.&nbsp; I also researched it to death.. essentially, to the point where there was no more information available.&nbsp; Ingesting it without informing yourself isn&#039;t too intelligent and can land you in the hospital or a mental ward.<br /><br />I agree that it doesn&#039;t have much use as a recreational substance.&nbsp; It&#039;s much more spiritual in that it teaches you; said lessons are delivered in a unique, and demanding, way and not via thought/understanding patterns like on psychedelics.<br /><br />I was unable to see for about 48-56 hours.&nbsp; I could see, but could not read any text.&nbsp; Objects in the distance (by distance, I mean across the room) were blurry and I do not have a need for glasses in my sober life.

				I tired it 20 years ago. Made tea from the leaves after ½ an hour nothing much happened and I made a stronger tea and then I really got hit by the effects. Can&#039;t remember how much grams of dried leaves it was.<br /><br />It tasted terrible and it was really hard not to vomit. The effects were like a delirium or a being in a dream and then waking up and slipping back. Hallucinating people who came and talked to me and gave me cigarettes then suddenly they and the cigarette would be gone and I would desperately search through my bed for the just disappeared burning cig and shortly after someone else would enter. It was very unpleasant, like a fever dream and I did not find there was anything to learn. It just went on and on like that all night.<br /><br />What worried me most however was that for three days following my pupils were stuck in a totally dilated state and I could not focus my eyes. I was for instance totally unable to read anything in a newspaper other than the biggest headlines and as it continued like that on the third day after I really got scared there had been permanent eye damage. Fortunately it got better on day 4 and then soon normalized.<br /><br />Anyway I really cannot recommend it and personally won&#039;t touch it again.<br />
