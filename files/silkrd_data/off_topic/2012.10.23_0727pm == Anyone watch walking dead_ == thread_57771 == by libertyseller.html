				I&#039;ve only watched the first 2 or 3 episodes and I can&#039;t get into it. I want a show about killing zombie sons of bitches, not a drama about zombie apocalypse family issues.<br /><br />Does the show get more intense after the beginning? I don&#039;t want to waste time watching the rest if I&#039;m not going to like it...

				They kill a shit ton of zombies, more in the last part of two and 4-5 episodes season 1 <br /><br />Death is all around! <br /><br /><br />Oh and (SPOILER) they find out EVERYONE is infected, bitten or not YOU WILL turn into a zombie when you die...

I forget when the zombie killing really starts to ramp up, but like lib said, by the end of season 1/season 2, there is a shit ton of zombie killing going on. Now in season 3 the team has been whittled down into a zombie killing machine. Very fun show, and very nicely crafted, imo.

				The writing went downhill since Darabont left the show. I still watch it, but they are slipping. People doing shit no one would do in the situation, that whole farm thing with the girl being dragged out waaaaaay too long, etc etc etc

				Personally, I love zombie shows/movies/everything. But the walking dead is just waay too corny for me.<br /><br />I do have an especially sensitive corn-o-meter, but the walking dead made it register off the scale.

				Yep, I think it&#039;s watchable, although some of the characters are a tad too annoying.(The cops wife, plus the farmer girl.) <br /><br />Although Norman is pretty wicked in it.&nbsp; ;D

				dude I talk about dexter at work and some people give looks you wouldn&#039;t believe - like you&#039;re a fucking sociopath.... on the other hand, people who understand the show get just want you&#039;re talking about and how well written (albeit dark/dark humor at times)

				I watch it on netflix and enjoy it. Its cheap entertainment, but entertainment none the less. Breaking bad is the best show ever made though IMO
