				I welcome difference of opinion in this thread! But first and foremost, to spout mine:<br /><br />WTF!?<br /><br />I&#039;m listening to the iTunes stream of Daft Punk&#039;s Random Access Memories, and all I can think is.... what the fuck!? It&#039;s absolutely dreadful in my eyes. Very boring.<br /><br />There&#039;s not much of an electronic, nevermind dance, feel to the album at all; to my ears, it sounds like an okay 70s funk bar band&#039;s EP, despite all the talented acts who collaborated for the album. I&#039;m all for the evolution of artists- Daft Punk&#039;s &#039;Discovery&#039; is very different from &#039;Homework&#039; yet both are fantastic- but this has seemingly no Daft Punk appeal. Before you reference robot voices as being a clear sign of their presence- remember Peter Frampton?<br /><br />It&#039;s not even how 70s/80s it sounds that&#039;s the problem- Discovery was almost entirely loops of funk and disco set to new music, and every single track on that album was perfect.<br /><br />Putting aside both genre and Daft Punk&#039;s previous works, plain and simple the album just feels... Mediocre. Boring. Average. Alright. Okay. Nothing special. &#039;Touch&#039; per example seems to be attempting to channel a vibe similar to Nine Inch Nail&#039;s (or Johnny Cash&#039;s cover of) Hurt... and failing to, adding in cheesy stereotypical portamento synth scales to boot. The teaser for &#039;Get Lucky&#039; is better than the actual song as it jumps right into the talk box line rather than the stupid gating in the final release.<br /><br />The only song I really like is &#039;Instant Crush,&#039; it has a very ethereal, heartbroken vibe to it that I enjoy. Plus I can relate to the lyrics... albeit &#039;So I chained myself to a friend, Cause I donâ€™t know what else I can do&#039; reminds me of when I was in high school and a submissive to a convicted ephebophilic furry trance DJ who hated Daft Punk- depression and loneliness combined with adolescence breed desperation &gt;__&gt;

				I listened to it three times yesterday and reflected on it. I have pretty much the exact same criticisms of the album as you point out. It needs AT LEAST 2-3 more actual &quot;robot&quot; jams before I&#039;d even call the album &quot;alright&quot;. Pretty disapointed overall. <br />If I wanted to hear other people sing I&#039;d listen to their albums. I wanted to hear mother fucking robots. Robots rocking. <br /><br />I thought that &#039;Get Lucky&#039; sounded very different than I recalled, thanks for confirming that it is. It sounded...kinda bad on the album. Most remixes are better.<br /><br />I did like &#039;Instant Crush&#039; too, as well as &#039;Doin It Right&#039;. As for the rest, I&#039;m with ya. I think they could have done alright with the 70s funk theme if only they would have SANG as you put it....and rocked that shit a little bit more, sans all of the human voices and pointless stories/talking.<br /><br />I have my fingers crossed that what I listened to isn&#039;t the actual/final album, but by the sound of it, I fear it is :(

				I tried to force myself to like the songs as much as I could. I felt it just wasn&#039;t right to say Daft Punk&#039;s new album blows...but it&#039;s the truth lol.<br />I don&#039;t know. Maybe they&#039;re just getting old, but the songs on there really can&#039;t go much further than being music to fall asleep to or something. <br />Still like Daft Punk, but I just feel like they should&#039;ve stopped after their last album.

Again, I&#039;m A-okay with a more organic feel, less sampling, less synths, more electro-acoustic instruments... if it&#039;s good. But this is just... blegh.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t change that Alive 2007 is pretty much my favorite headfuck music on acid and a great album on Ecstasy. Though for all of those who ask- the music did come first; the drugs, far later. By the majority&#039;s logic, Daft Punk is a gateway.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: le botbahn</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">sans all of the human voices and pointless stories/talking.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I presumed the talking was a temporary watermark so that people wouldn&#039;t rip the song from the stream o.0 I hope FFS that it&#039;s not on the actual album, even if the interview is good in isolation!

				I am hearing this a lot. I couldn&#039;t disagree more. It was supposed to be a tribute to 70s disco grooves, why wouldn&#039;t it sound like that? I guess I was left disappointed after the first listen but I was overtaken expectation. After a few listens, WOW. <br /><br />I believe they made what they genuinely wanted people to hear. People will come to like it&nbsp; ;)

				It was... very shitty.&nbsp; I was waiting for this album forever and it was pure disappointment.&nbsp; Basically sounded like another main stream DJ making remixes of songs just by repeating sounds and not mixing very well. They talked this album up so much saying that, &quot;it&#039;s what people deserve&quot;, and it&#039;s shit (I sound like an ass but it&#039;s true).&nbsp; Get lucky is decent but if it were produced by anyone else it wouldn&#039;t even get a second look.

				Random Access Memories is a very boring album and the only song on it that I would listen to more than once is Get Lucky. I&#039;m a fan of Daft Punk&#039;s old stuff and a huge fan of EDM in general but this is just not really electronic music anymore. It&#039;s not even something I&#039;d put on in the background for ambiance. All I can really say is the album has high production values, that&#039;s it.

				DP is very hit and miss with me, I have to say. I distinctly remember hearing/seeing &quot;One More Time&quot; for the very first time and thinking &quot;Is this a joke? No really, this is a joke, right?&quot;<br /><br />Liked the Tron soundtrack - thought it suited the film well. Have yet to check out RAMs but not expecting greatness.
