				OK buyers, you all hate it when Vendors make you finalize early...well here&#039;s a juicy tidbit of info...<br /><br />FINALIZE YOUR FUCKING PURCHASES WHEN YOU GET THE PRODUCT!<br /><br />God damn, I have 3 buyers sitting on funds right now because they haven&#039;t come on the site to finalize....<br /><br />I KNOW YOU GOT YOUR PACKAGES, I SENT THEM WITH DELIVERY CONFIRMATION!!!<br /><br />Fuck, here&#039;s whats going to happen.&nbsp; If these three don&#039;t get their acts together, they are going to ruin it for every single future buyer who wants to order from me.&nbsp; IF they cant be asses to finalize once they get their shit, then everyone is going to have to start finalizing BEFORE i will even ship.&nbsp; This is fucking bullshit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did you ever think that MAYBE i would need those coins in a timely manner?<br /><br />Mark my words, if i don&#039;t get three finalizations in the next couple hours, there will be no more escrow for me.

				I also have a problem with SELLERS saying that I can finalize once I receive the product, but I WARN them of my location and of how LONG it takes to get to me and yet they still say to only finalize once I have received my goods. Then once 14 or 15 days are up they call me out telling me to finalize early as I must have received my product already! Meanwhile I still have like 6 days left to finalize before it Auto- finalizes and in THOSE 6 DAYS I USUALLY RECEIVE MY PRODUCT!!! <br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is that if my order takes 17 days to get to me and there is 1 day left to finalize before it Auto-Finalizes. I WILL FINALIZE ON THAT VERY LAST DAY if I received my stuff just before it auto finalizes to protect myself! But I only do this if it has been agreed upon at the starting time of the purchase...<br /><br />Not calling anyone out on this one, Just stating what has happened to me on 2 occassions...

I know how irritating that shit is.

				Yeah I see his point with the DCN. My guys never had DCN so that was what I was pointing out. They never knew if I had the order or not yet.<br /><br />But all in all people need to log onto SR as soon as they have received their items in order to pay the vendors what&#039;s rightfully theirs. Not wait and doodle till whenever they feel like it. This is business, once you have received your products...PAY FOR THEM IMMEDIATELY!

				As A buyer, I can say that I always finalize as soon as I receive the order, its good for the buyers rep, sellers rep, and business all the way around.<br />I know the earlier I finalize, The faster the vendor can get their funds, get new supply, and make it better for the whole SR community.<br /><br />Buyers Please dont sit around and get high after you get your product and forget to finalize! The vendors need there money too, especially after taking there time and risking there ass to get you something to get high with. And especially if they have a DCN! <br /><br />Maybe I could understand if there was no DCN, and it being the holiday season, when orders can take a little longer to get to there destination. <br /><br /><br />Dont scam good vendors! It hurts you and the SR community as whole!
