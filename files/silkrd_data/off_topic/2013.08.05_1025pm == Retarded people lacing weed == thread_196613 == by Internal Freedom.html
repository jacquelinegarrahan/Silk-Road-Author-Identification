				Well I had a blast at this weekends music festival, did 2C-I, LSD, MDMA, MDA and unfortunately some random shit I still don&#039;t know what it was.<br /><br />Near the end of the last show people were passing around joints, I was so fucking high I didn&#039;t even stop to ask if it was just weed. I noticed it was unusually smooth to pull and didn&#039;t really have a taste, no burn either. I was on MDA at the time and very shortly after taking a hit from this joint I completely mellowed out and started zoning out really hard to the music and everything got darker around me. I started hallucinating vividly (which I know MDA does, but up until this point I had not hallucinated AT ALL on it), seeing random color bursts off the lighting and patterns showing up on the backs of peoples heads. I got really really tired as well and just wanted to sit and not move, which again was strange because I had just popped the MDA 3 hours ago.<br /><br />Im fairly open to trying new shit, I was just pissed off that it ruined my roll and that I didn&#039;t know I was taking it. On the way home and for another 3 hours until I slept, I had the coolest auditory hallucinations ive ever had. I literally heard electro songs playing at full blast in a completely silent room, and was head bobbing and moving to the beat of the non-existent songs. Probably looked like I was fucking insane lol, but it was sweet hearing FULL songs go off in my head for hours while I stared at the ceiling.<br /><br />Anyways, don&#039;t lace your fucking weed. And if you do, tell people what the fuck it is. I still don&#039;t even know what i took

				Not saying it wasn&#039;t laced, but just wanted to add that the first time I tried MDA I didn&#039;t feel like it was really hitting until I had some of a joint, and everything kicked in really quickly after I smoked it, colours, spacey feeling, the whole deal. Weed is often an AWESOME enhancer.
