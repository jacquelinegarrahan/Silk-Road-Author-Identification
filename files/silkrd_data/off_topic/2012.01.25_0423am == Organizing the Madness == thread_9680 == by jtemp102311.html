				That&#039;d be great if we had 1,500 vendors and thousands of listings. Adding all that would really just over complicate it even more, don&#039;t you think?<br />Though I do miss the BTC conversion at the bottom, whatever happened with that?

				Yeah some organizing would be a very nice implementation. <br /><br />But on to you getting guns of SR...it&#039;s not a good thing to ban guns. The whole point of SR is to be a free market, and if we start banning guns, what will be next is my question. I do understand the reason for no guns, I loath violence. But banning things is not the right way to go. All we have to do is not buy the guns, and soon there will be no demand for guns and so there will be no guns.

				How about pruning the listings so we don&#039;t have custom orders, moonshine, and other random shit in the cannabis/other sections? I see a lot of people putting listings in places they don&#039;t belong just because it is a higher traffic category. This shouldn&#039;t be so.<br /><br />Just my bitch/rant and .02btc. not much.
