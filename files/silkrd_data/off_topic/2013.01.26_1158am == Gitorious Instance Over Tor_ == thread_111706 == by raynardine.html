				Title: <strong>Gitorious Instance Over Tor?</strong><br />

				Does anyone know about a public gitorious instance running over a tor location-hidden service?<br /><br />The source code is here: https://gitorious.org/gitorious/mainline/blobs/master/HACKING<br /><br />The project is primarily written in Ruby, as a web-application front-end to the Git revision control software.<br /><br />It could be really handy for nefarious code.<br /><br />Also, in case it isn&#039;t clear, I mean running our OWN copy of the web application, and a complete stack of servers and forking all of our own code, not linking somewhat to the service running at gitorious.org.

				I&#039;m not familiar with it in the least, but I don&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I&#039;m not entirely sure what&#039;s so nefarious that we&#039;d have to hide our identities while being able to collaborate in its development though...?

WTF are they smoking?&quot;<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m being overly paranoid, but I can&#039;t help but think that certain things should only be developed over Tor and Bitcoin, and everything related to the software&#039;s production isolated and protected within the Darknet.

				Well, actually, the lead Tor developer occasionally gives talks for the CIA to explain the technology and its use -- that sort of thing.&nbsp; It was originally funded by a branch of the military, but no longer receives funding from the government if I recall correctly.&nbsp; My point is this: it isn&#039;t terribly seditious in the end.<br /><br />As for Bitcoin... well, he didn&#039;t release it under his real name.&nbsp; Satoshi is almost universally believed to be a completely fake identity, and he&#039;s since disappeared entirely.&nbsp; If you mean Andreesen or whatever his name is, I think he&#039;s actually involved with a branch of government now... I don&#039;t remember who or what or why, it&#039;s just a vague recollection I have about him.<br /><br />But Silk Road?&nbsp; Yeah, there&#039;s no way I&#039;d release software having anything to do with SR under any identity except a completely fake one.
