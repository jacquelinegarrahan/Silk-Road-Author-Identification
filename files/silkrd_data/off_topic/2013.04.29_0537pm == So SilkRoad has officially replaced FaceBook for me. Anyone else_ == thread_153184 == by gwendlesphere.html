				Okay. So I clearly live the life of a dickhead who spends any of his non-necessity-based drug time at work, working 2-3 nights a week, and spending the rest of my time (literally) on either fucking Facebook, 4chan or YouTube.<br /><br />This facebook/youtube/4chan time has been promptly replaced by SilkRoad, ever since I found it about 2 months ago. I don&#039;t even buy a single fucking thing 90% of the time I&#039;m on it, I just enjoy the convenience of knowing I can log onto a fucking website whenever I want to to be able to obtain a drug that I can have the time of my fucking life on every 1-2 weeks, based on distance of vendor, or when I plan to just get fucked up.<br /><br />Is it sad that I have spent so much of my free attention on SR? I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />All I know is, now I&#039;ve found a hobby that costs me less (literally) than most hobbies, as I spend maybe 90-100 dollars per week, and that&#039;s based on highly researched and scrutinized products from heavily investigated vendors, and I get a hell of a lot of better and more entertaining fucking material from it.<br /><br />All in all, I received maybe 1-2 grams of MDMA and about 5-10 sheets of extremely high-quality LSD from various trusted vendors every week, and it never fucking costs me more than $100 every week, which is way less than I would ever spend with normal recreational activites (cinema, drinking, driving places to go fishing or social functions/gatherings). Within the chemicals that I obtain from SR with these regulated transactions, I manage to spend up to 16 fucking hours a day having mind-altering and sometimes life-changing experiences, and if I choose to add MDMA, I often have truly TRULY empathetic and orgasmic experiences in the midst of psyechedelic experiences/<br /><br />So no, in no way am I saying SR is in any way comparable to FaceBook in value and integrity, not by a fucking long shot.<br /><br />However, I can safely say that my &quot;neutral&quot; online activity (which, let&#039;s face it, is almost always facebook/twitter/whatever social network you desire) has been completely and uttermost devoted to SilkRoad, for it&#039;s purely amazing presentation of providing the most obscure and intense ranges and varieties of drugs of the best quality, for the best prices - for the lowest risk - hands down.<br /><br />Hands up if you agree.<br /><br />This is obviously from a, by comparison to normal SRer&#039;s, newbie perspective.<br /><br />Holla at ya boi m8

				I don&#039;t have or use facebook but I sure enjoy Silk Road.&nbsp; Silk Road doesn&#039;t have the highest quality and has the highest prices for me.&nbsp; I can see where people with no good drug connections would find higher quality on here.&nbsp; That allows people like me to make a lot of money :)&nbsp; I enjoy the forums though.

				That, and most of the people I would feel I need to converse/associate with by obligation, just seem to be completely useless transactions of time and energy for the little value of intellectual collaboration, compared to something like some of the, even solitary, experiences I have since I&#039;ve had some extremely high-quality LSD delivered to me from some amazing vendors here.<br /><br />So..<br /><br />I fucking thank you for that.<br /><br />And thank you, DPR, for being you.<br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I love this place. And I&#039;m not even on drugs right now. WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT. :D<br /><br />Good vibes to everybody, and happy tripping/rolling/tweaking. I love you all.<br /><br />Have a great week :)

				I don&#039;t do anything with any social network sites. <br />I&#039;m reminded of the old quote &quot;Never put anything on paper, my boy, and never trust a man with a small black mustache.&quot;-- PG Wodehouse<br /><br />&quot;They&quot; have already collected way too much information on most of us.

In a lot of social/work situations with my job, having any kind of noticeable association with drug connections is extremely risky and pointless.<br /><br />So something where, where someone can smartly keep on top of their online security, someone can buy their favourite (and domestically expensive/unobtainable drugs, like AUS for example, for some drugs that are just ridiculously hard to come buy) drug, is just a fucking blessing.<br /><br />I have absolutely no FUCKING QUALMS at all with spending an extra $2-$3 to vendors who need to cover hosting commissions for SR, because I am dealing with a sure-fire and completely reliable drug-administering system, where I know trusted vendors will be providing bullet-proof quality drugs.<br /><br />People like me cannot physically, by any means, acquire decent LSD/MDMA/MDA/DMT in my area, no matter how connected I am (I&#039;d rather not disclose more info than AUS on my location)... And DEFINITELY can&#039;t obtain them for less than $15-20 per hit of anything (anything: acid/molly/MDA, anything). So SilkRoad for me, and people close to me, as you can imagine, is just god-send.<br /><br />Just realise how valuable this place is.

				Everything seems to be 50 to 100 percent markup from my suppliers prices.&nbsp; The 240 ounces of weed aren&#039;t marked up :)&nbsp; The pounds are though.&nbsp; RCs are heavily marked up.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good thing though.&nbsp; It causes a distribution of wealth.&nbsp; People with too much money can spend it on here and distribute it to people with better drug connections.&nbsp; Both parties are happy.&nbsp; It works out quite nicely in the end.<br /><br />I just noticed you&#039;re in the outback.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard AUS has high prices for drugs so I bet this is pretty cheap for you.&nbsp; Very nice :)<br /><br />Have you ever caught a Kangaroo?&nbsp; www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcN0hl55S8I

Most of your &quot;OMG MAN THIS PLACE IS AMAZING EVRYTHING IS SO CHEEP M8 OMG&quot; clientele, I will almost exclusively guarantee, is Australian. Our drugs are so fucking expensive here, just by the standard of control, contamination and legal implications on the drug trade (our customs seem to be very intuitive and vigilant).<br /><br />So yeah, no doubt if I was living in the UK/Canada/Western Europe, I wouldn&#039;t even know what SR was, because I would be too busy partying hard or tripping fucking balls from all the easily-obtainable and cheap drugs just getting around by hand or word of mouth. Bastards ;_;<br /><br />I know that merely because I&#039;ve been overseas a few times, and the easy access to quality drugs just makes Australia look like a fucking country full of underage kids trying to exchange nicotine pills.<br /><br />Fuck you guys :P<br /><br />Yeah.. for aussies, this place is just godly.

				We need a proper hidden service social network with pseudonymous users. There are open source, federated social network applications like Friendica and Diaspora. Someone with the knowledge and talent to properly secure one of them should offer it as a hidden service.<br /><br />The main drawback is that it costs money to run a server, and it would be really hard to display ads on a hidden service, so if it got popular enough, they would have to charge for the service.<br />
