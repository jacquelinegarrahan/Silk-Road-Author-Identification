				Has anyone else done MDPV at school/work/any other related environment and managed to positively benefit from it? I don&#039;t see how it could and I&#039;d be interested in whatever way made it help.<br /><br /><br />For the last week, I&#039;ve been using PV at school to assist me on the finals and improve my thinking with a small amount every 2 hours or so because I always figured it&#039;d be great for essays and other stuff with small doses, but I imagine the doses I did were higher than intended +10/-10 especially since I didn&#039;t have much time to get it done in the bathroom stall as staff is always in there and some ignorant students looked through the locked-space to see if it was empty and I was in a hurry to avoid hearing &quot;Oh shit, I can see someone doing cocaine in there!&quot;, anyways I took my 2nd zone finals test on it, couldn&#039;t stop moving, didn&#039;t talk to my friends, kept looking around, more difficult to think, extremely paranoid. etc. Later during my lunch zone, I dehydrated for a few minutes and saw nothing but stars and loud noises, if this didn&#039;t happen before then I would have been convinced I was dying. All I could reply with was &quot;What?&quot; and &quot;I can&#039;t hear you.&quot; while trying to hear what my girlfriend was saying to me, then I thought a teacher called my name but all I heard was the sound of flowing water, an announcement came on and I still didn&#039;t hear it but I thought it was for me, I drank some water and felt normal again. I asked my girlfriend about the announcement and she said she wasn&#039;t paying attention, asked some friends and they didn&#039;t know either. Some of my friends knew about the PV, so I figured someone fucked me over or another person overheard and told an administrator or something to get me searched. Of course I was extremely paranoid because besides the PV, I also had a nickel of weed, paraphernalia (pen tube, marijuana pipe, lighter, etc)&nbsp; and some Trazadones I just used for sleep and partial comedown helpers. I hid all my stuff in the pocket inside of my sweatshirt (really useful for basic search not involving the law), and then people kept looking at me, and a group of girls in front of me started pointing at me and looking at eachother and I thought they said something like &quot;He&#039;s right there.&quot; so I was really freaking out and looking for people coming for me, I saw one of the main administrators where he normally was, then some kid pointed in my direction and he started quickly walking over to me, and surprisingly walked right by me. People kept looking at me and finally my lunch zone was over so I started walking back to class. I found one of my friends and gave him all my shit to hold until the end of the day and walked to class. I was waiting to be greeted by a police officer but it didn&#039;t happen. At one point while everyone was talking, I thought I heard my 2nd zone teacher&#039;s voice (the one I mentioned earlier) and I thought she was talking to my other teacher about me, I kept hearing &quot;Yeah, he usually gets everything done and it&#039;s just sad to see that, during the exam he just kept looking at me and looking back to the clock and around the room, and wouldn&#039;t sit still, he was definitely on something.&quot; and I had the urge to turn around and say &quot;I wasn&#039;t even looking at you and I was looking around because I finished my fucking exam with nothing left to do!&quot; but you know, I had no idea if it was just one of those psychosis-related things or if it was actually real so I didn&#039;t bother even looking back, I just kept jotting down random notes as I continued listening to their questionable discussion. At one point I looked back but didn&#039;t see anyone else, and then my teacher used the phone and went outside of the room to talk, and a few minutes later the door just opened and she went outside the door to give that person a packet of documents, I kept looking to the door waiting to be called. When the last bell rang, I slowly walked out so it didn&#039;t look like I was rushing to get to the bathroom for anything suspicious. I went outside and got my stuff back from said friend, then began walking to my car and kept hearing my name but ignored it. I decided it would be best to not fuck with peeve during that time, and overall even most social situations because of the paranoid-effect preventing conversation and fun. It just gave me another thing to add to the list of &quot;Was that real or was it just the PV?&quot;, along with the other times of still being unable to remember if certain things really happened or not, the other one involved someone entering my room at around 4:00AM to accuse me of something, I won&#039;t get into that but I&#039;ll just say I hid my laptop and battery in two different places and was yelling and threatening imaginary people that were &quot;hiding and waiting to kill me&quot; in my hallway. The fun never stops with this stuff. <br /><br />tl;dr - I pretty much failed all my exams except for one which I passed perfectly somehow. I don&#039;t recommend using it at all for that, but if it seemed like a good idea to anyone, it would probably be best to have patience and try it out at usual times before using it for anything major like exams and finals. I could imagine doing it at a job would be similar and just as bad due to the anxiety and paranoia alone.

				Why did you think MDPV would be an effective nootropic? Try getting your hands on speed or even better, Dexedrine.

				Am I the only person that really enjoys MDPV?&nbsp; I can do the stuff for days at a time, feel great, accomplish shit due to an incredibly long attention span...I read all kinds of horror stories, that I&#039;m sure are true, but I prefer this drug to cocaine or meth...BUT--you do have to treat it with respect..<br /><br />ww

				Man idk how you thought PV would be good for tests. I&#039;ve never done it but shit the only thing I&#039;ve heard of helping during tests is addies. Try coping some of them next time rofl. Hey on the bright side it wasn&#039;t a complete failure, you did pass one test!
