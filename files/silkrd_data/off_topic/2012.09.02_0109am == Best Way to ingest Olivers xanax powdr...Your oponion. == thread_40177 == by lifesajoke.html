				I wont mix it with alcohol I don&#039;t drink and snorting it doesn&#039;t absorb in the mucus membrane.<br /><br />THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO TAKE IY IS<br />a little tissue paper and parachute it.<br /><br />Is this the only way...I no its not water solvable either.<br /><br />Whatcha know?<br /><br />

You can find it in the laxative section of the.bb pharmacy.<br /><br />Mixing it in a small amount of alcohol wont me you.drunk if thats your concern.<br /><br />An alternative option is to mix it in alcohol at a predetermined concentration per mL. Using a syringe, measure out your desired dose and slowly drip that volume on to homemade blotter paper (any paper or tissue works). The alcohol evaporates, leaving the alprazolam.embedded in the paper matrix. Now you have portable tabs (like acid blotter). The same concept could be applied to candy smarties or other items (use your imagination).<br /><br />If someone can share their knowledge on alprazolam solubilities I&#039;d really appreciate your input!<br /><br />But just an example, take 100 mL alcohol. Add to it 100 MILIgrams alprazolam powder. Thoroughly mix. Now you have 1 miligram alprazolam per 1 mL (cc) alcohol. <br />&nbsp;<br />To make.a 1 mg Alprazolam paper tab, simply apply 1 mL alcohol/alpraz. solution and let it dry. It may require applying 0.5 ml, letting it dry, then adding another 0.5 ml depending on the size of tab.<br /><br />I.d like to know the solubility of alprazolam because if you can make the solution more concentrated the process becomes easier.<br />But the above 1mg/ml is a good starting point.<br /><br />I wouldnt trust your scale to weigh out single mg doses unless you paid 10,000$ for it.<br /><br />Any any event, be sure to understand what you are.doing before doing it and.seek help if any doubt. Feel free to pm.me.any.time if you need help :)

				Capsuling sounds great, but good luck getting that doseage down to 1-2mg. That better be one badass scale, and make sure not to breathe on it while you&#039;re measuring, it may sway it +/- a few mg&#039;s.....and that could be the difference between getting a good nights&#039; sleep and missing work completely tomorrow, LOL

				It&#039;s quite difficult to dose capsules using the powder because measuring precisely 1 or 2 milligrams requires expensive equipment with very high precision, and is time consuming. <br />Using lower precision equipment - hence less costly - one sensible method would be make a concentrated solution in a solvent like dichloromethane, but ensure it is a known concentration, say 20mg /mL. You could then use an insulin syringe to deliver 10 units of solution into each capsule. Allow the dichloromethane to evaporate before sealing the capsules and you have 2mg capsules of alprazolam.<br /><br />The group I experiment which found that the most consistent effect with alprazolam powder sourced on silk road was to place the powder directly in the mouth and wait a few minutes for absorption. It doesn&#039;t taste terribly nice, but it&#039;s nothing compared to san pedro cactus soup or laudanum. A couple of minutes after administering this way sipping milk or a gently fortified wine seemed to assist onset. <br />&nbsp; Swallowing powder wrapped in paper had variable effects from person to person, and for any given person from occasion to occasion. It was generally accepted by the group to be less efficient than simply putting the power directly into the mouth with no real focus on swallowing it. I suspect the varying conditions of the stomach in response to the time of day, previous food eaten, and current acidity affects alprazolam&#039;s efficacy if it&#039;s being swallowed, but I say this acknowledging that I&#039;m not sufficiently familiar with the molecule&#039;s properties to suggest a mechanism for this, or produce evidence to support it being true. It&#039;s merely a consensus observation amongst my fellow travelers.<br /><br />According to the person most familiar with alprazolam, dissolving it in warm vodka and consuming 3mg of alprazolam in solution gave sensations and onset very closely mirroring having taken 3 mg in pill form.

				le bothan has the best method for this since mg scales are ridiculously overpriced... the glycol is about the best solution to use. there are writeups how to make sweet tarts or candies &#039;tabs&#039; .. also another way would be to get the little tiny mg spoon (measuring utensils) forgot what they are called .. but i think you can measure out something close to 1 mg by doing yourself and adjusting it accordingly. i think i could get it pretty close.. <br />wish i would have done something more smart with my bag of forgetful powder :P <br />i was doing finger dips just barely on the finger nail. but the more fucked up i got.. the more i didnt give a fuck if the does was too large.. man that was one rough week.. ended up losing 50 mg of powder coz i forgot where i stashed it LOL .. good luck

I&#039;m sure the next person to make it to the end of the bag and/or actually remembering finishing the powder will be the first. <br /><br />Hell, I can&#039;t usually go orders of 25-50 xanax bars without losing a bunch or forgetting taking them. I&#039;m not sure which one either usually lol
