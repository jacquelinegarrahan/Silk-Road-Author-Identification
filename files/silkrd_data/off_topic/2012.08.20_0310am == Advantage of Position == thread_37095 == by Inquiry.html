				no, he said he wanted to earn cash on the side, so joining LEAP isn&#039;t what he&#039;s after. I read the OP as him saying he wanted to be a dickwad cop like all the rest abusing their power and making money on the side with extortion, etc. that&#039;s why I offer to pay him to follow my suggestion instead.

				Step by step guide <br /><br />1. Wake up in the morning.<br /><br />2. Get dressed.<br /><br />3. Drive to work.<br /><br />4. Go down the evidence room or get access to the firearm officers lock up.<br /><br />5. Find a fire arm of your own choosing. <br /><br />6. Blow your brains out and ensure that they go all over your commanding officers face. <br /><br />7. Have a nice day.

				The only thing I hate worse than a cop just doing his job is a hypocritical crooked cop. To be honest, I don&#039;t have a problem with a man who feels some sort of moral drive to become a police officer motivated by an honest desire to help his community. I have a real problem with dirtbags like the OP who want to hurt their friends and ruin families to feel powerful, and want to rob the innocent to pad their wallets.
