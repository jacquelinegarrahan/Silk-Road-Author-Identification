				I am 100% sure one reason the prices are so damn here on silk road is due to scammers.&nbsp; They scam the sellers and the seller are forced to raise the price of their product to compensate for their losses from scammers.&nbsp; Fucking low life scum bastards.&nbsp; Your not just stealing from the drug dealers, your stealing from everyone.<br /><br />This is also true in the legal market.&nbsp; USA buyers pay 2 billion dollars extra each year because businesses have to raise prices to make up for thieving subhuman scum bastards!<br /><br />

				It&#039;s true, if there was a better way to avoid scammers my prices would drop at least 10%<br /><br />I&#039;ve advocated for a more transparent buyer feedback system, but it&#039;s really tricky finding a balance between privacy and security.

				Agreed.<br /><br />There should also be &#039;resend&#039; option built into the resolution center, because as it is now.. a resend goes unchecked .. you cannot see how many resend a buyer has received. <br /><br />I recently had a buyer claim he never received an order .. I offered a refund or a resend.<br /><br />He chose a resend, and he received that resend, and STILL asked for a refund for a minor issue that he even admitted wasn&#039;t my fault. ... when he doesnt get it, he leaves exaggerated shitty feedback as if i ripped him off.

				I&#039;d think even a small fee for a buyer&#039;s account would drive tons of traffic away and you&#039;d see a decrease in sales. And it wouldn&#039;t necessarily deter scammers... Say a reasonable buyer&#039;s account is $10 or even $30. Buy an account, scam someone out of $100 of product and you&#039;ve still made a profit. Rinse and repeat?<br /><br />Seeing as how I&#039;m pretty sure you need money in your account to scam someone anyways (i.e., you need to have the appropriate USD or it won&#039;t let you check out, for obvious reasons), it really wouldn&#039;t deter anyone. In my opinion, any ways.<br /><br />SilkRoad as it is is probably okay. There is a risk with new buyers and new sellers so buying and selling is made harder earlier on, and as you gain reputation presumably it becomes easier.

				Is SR really all that expensive?<br /><br />I bought 1g of MDMA for around $65 US. That&#039;s eight 125mg doses for less than $9 a dose.

				I agree Buyers should have Posting on their account of re-sends and not just reimbursements. Every 5 or 10 flawless purchases earns you a Status and increases amount of BC Value Purchase in X days. The tighter the leash and more challenging it is to make a Rank, the less likely you&#039;ll want to pull a fast one. Especially if say a newbie with less than 3 sales is treated like a Leper until he/she proves themselves. In today&#039;s world you could be a Criminal, but If you&#039;ve got a Good Credit Score you have people wanting to hand you the world. If your Credit Rating is fucked, you cant even get Job!

				Also, some opiates are expensive if you dont have insurance. For example. Opana ER 40&#039;s are close to 20 bucks a piece. opana 10 IRs are around 10 bucks a piece. So, that is cost, then you add shipping, risk, scammers, etc. the only med that I see that is way over priced is the 32 dollar roxie.. those can cost up to 5 bucks a piece a pharmacy but most of the time a cheaper.<br /><br />So, it depends on the item, etc. If there isn&#039;t profit to be made then its not going to be sold. Also, if you don&#039;t like the prices then go somewhere else and buy it. its obvious that the vendors that are charging high prices are getting what they are asking.. Ill be offering opana 10 irs soon. they have to be expensive, I have no choice, or I cant sell them. I would rather eat them than give them away or&nbsp; make very little...

				Psychedelics are out of proportion for sure--as compared with my local prices. Not too bad, but really a bit too much. In general Silk Road is a small market, so perhaps with a little growth and more competition prices will fall.

				IMO<br /><br />Pricing seems to be high on SR for several reasons,<br /><br />Its not like going to the street corner or buying from your buddy that you&#039;ve known for years. One main reason why SR is popular is because we have an escrow option. This comes with a price, a certain % of the total order. It takes time to manage and run a site like this. I wouldn&#039;t do it for free. when you offer a service like anonymity, escrow, hedging, and a sense of security, you can expect to pay a small fee for the added security.<br /><br />The vendors have to take a lot of extra time to be secure and package and ship orders. I would charge extra too. Like I said its not like your going by your buddy&#039;s house and selling something. It takes a lot of extra time and energy to ship safely and securely. thats worth a little extra coin in my opinion.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t do all that for the same price as selling to my good friend when they stop by the house.<br /><br />If there is only one or two vendors selling a particular product then they have all the market and no competition. So they can then set the price of a product to whatever they want because there is no competition. And yea.. They will sell it because no other vendor is offering it, or competing with there prices.<br /><br />Also, depending on the quantity, quality, and local value of the product the vendor is offering makes a big difference too.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then there are vendors that know people want to get high, and just do straight price gauging because they know you want it so bad. Supply and demand.<br />Im sure there can be several things added to the list.<br /><br />Thats why its always good to find a good trusted vendor that you can trust 100% with no issue. Is that not worth a few extra dollars?

				<br />the factors / reasons are;<br /><br />replacing the F2F and trust associated with that with trying to run the same business anonymously and the extra cost and risk that it introduces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&gt;:(<br />

				I agree that it&#039;s a whole multitude of factors affecting the pricing on SR.<br /><br />When you buy from SR, you&#039;re not just buying drugs, you&#039;re also purchasing:<br />-the convenience of having it posted to a place of your choosing<br />-anonymity of transaction (which is worth a fair amount if you can&#039;t afford to be caught!!)<br />-often exotic products, which you wouldn&#039;t be able to get your hands on from your local dealer<br /><br />These, and other factors send the price higher from the get-go without even considering commissions, the impact of scammers etc. When you go to a service station, you pay more for a coke than you do if you go to the supermarket. You&#039;re paying for the convenience of not having to find a park, walk into the shops, find the product in the aisles and then walk back to your car. It&#039;s the bread and butter of these kind of stores. No one is forcing anyone to buy things at the inflated prices in the convenience store - but people do.<br /><br />Same goes here - it&#039;s about as free a market as you can get on here, and if people pay the prices sellers advertise (whether it be because they have a good rep, good product, are local etc), then they have every right (and in my opinion should) charge what the market will bear. This encourages competition and is good for buyers in the end. <br /><br />If someone thinks they can set up shop and sell more product by competing on a lower price platform, they are free to do so - and the sellers charging a high price will either (a) be forced to offer a lower price to compete or (b) differentiate their service/product to justify the higher price.<br /><br />Long live the free market!
