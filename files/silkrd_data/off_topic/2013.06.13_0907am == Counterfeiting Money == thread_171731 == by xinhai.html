				Title: <strong>Counterfeiting Money</strong><br />

				Counterfeiting Money by JRoger<br />Before reading this article, it would be a very good idea to get a book on photo offset printing, for this is the<br />method used in counterfeiting US currency. If you are familiar with this method of printing, counterfeiting should be<br />a simple task for you.<br />Genuine currency is made by a process called &quot;gravure&quot;, which involves etching a metal block. Since etching a metal<br />block is impossible to do by hand, photo offset printing comes into the process.<br />Photo offset printing starts by making negatives of the currency with a camera, and putting the negatives on a piece<br />of masking material (usually orange in color). The stripped negatives, commonly called &quot;flats&quot;, are then exposed to a<br />lithographic plate with an arc light plate maker. The burned plates are then developed with the proper developing<br />chemical. One at a time, these plates are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.<br />The press to use should be an 11 by 14 offset, such as the AB Dick 360. Make 2 negatives of the portrait side of the<br />bill, and 1 of the back side. After developing them and letting them dry, take them to a light table. Using opaque on<br />one of the portrait sides, touch out all the green, which is the seal and the serial numbers. The back side does not<br />require any retouching, because it is all one color. Now, make sure all of the negatives are registered (lined up<br />correctly) on the flats. By the way, every time you need another serial number, shoot 1 negative of the portrait side,<br />cut out the serial number, and remove the old serial number from the flat replacing it with the new one.<br />Now you have all 3 flats, and each represents a different color: black, and 2 shades of green (the two shades of green<br />are created by mixing inks). Now you are ready to burn the plates. Take a lithographic plate and etch three marks on<br />it. These marks must be 2 and 9/16 inches apart, starting on one of the short edges. Do the same thing to 2 more<br />plates. Then, take 1 of the flats and place it on the plate, exactly lining the short edge up with the edge of the<br />plate. Burn it, move it up to the next mark, and cover up the exposed area you have already burned. Burn that, and do<br />the same thing 2 more times, moving the flat up one more mark. Do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a<br />separate plate). Develop all three plates. You should now have 4 images on each plate with an equal space between each<br />bill.<br />The paper you will need will not match exactly, but it will do for most situations. The paper to use should have a 25%<br />rag content. By the way, Disaperf computer paper (invisible perforation) does the job well. Take the paper and load it<br />into the press. Be sure to set the air, buckle, and paper thickness right. Start with the black plate (the plate<br />without the serial numbers). Wrap it around the cylinder and load black ink in. Make sure you run more than you need<br />because there will be a lot of rejects. Then, while that is printing, mix the inks for the serial numbers and the back<br />side. You will need to add some white and maybe yellow to the serial number ink. You also need to add black to the<br />back side. Experiment until you get it right. Now, clean the press and print the other side. You will now have a bill<br />with no green seal or serial numbers. Print a few with one serial number, make another and repeat. Keep doing this<br />until you have as many different numbers as you want. Then cut the bills to the exact size with a paper cutter. You<br />should have printed a large amount of money by now, but there is still one problem; the paper is pure white. To dye<br />it, mix the following in a pan: 2 cups of hot water, 4 tea bags, and about 16 to 20 drops of green food coloring<br />(experiment with this). Dip one of the bills in and compare it to a genuine US bill. Make the necessary adjustments,<br />and dye all the bills. Also, it is a good idea to make them look used. For example, wrinkle them, rub coffee grinds on<br />them, etc.<br />As before mentioned, unless you are familiar with photo offset printing, most of the information in this article will<br />be fairly hard to understand. Along with getting a book on photo offset printing, try to see the movie &quot;To Live and<br />Die in LA&quot;. It is about a counterfeiter, and the producer does a pretty good job of showing how to counterfeit. A good<br />book on the subject is &quot;The Poor Man&#039;s James Bond&quot;.<br />If all of this seems too complicated to you, there is one other method available for counterfeiting: The Canon color<br />laser copier. The Canon can replicate ANYTHING in vibrant color, including US currency. But, once again, the main<br />problem in counterfeiting is the paper used. So, experiment, and good luck!<br />-= Exodus =-<br />

				This has been available on the clearnet for several years. I don&#039;t know why you felt the need to post it.
