				Some people have bad trips on this combination. I&#039;ve only done this combination once. Actually, it was 100ug of LSD with 10mg of Dexedrine. It added clarity and focus to the trip, while the heightened awareness of LSD seemed to increase the euphoriant effect of Dexedrine. If I were you I&#039;d start with the lowest effective dosage of Adderall.

				Well, having practically completed a math degree before switching to my true love, organic chemistry, I&#039;d say forget the acid and double up on the amphetamine.&nbsp; With acid, you&#039;ll probably get very little or nothing done on it.&nbsp; Save the acid for after you get that A on your midterm.

				The only problem with using LSD to study is that you&#039;ll find a thousand excuses to do something else. But if you have the will-power to focus on the study material for the entire duration of the trip, I think LSD can be a very effective learning aid.

The only problem is that you will, as acidhead said, find a thousand reasons to stop typing.<br /><br />Like I said, as long as you can handle your acid instead of it handling you. Remember, it may seem to have a consciousness, it may even seem to ask you things (though not in words), but LSD is a tool, not your master unless you allow it to be.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hence the amphetamine! do you think it will help me stay focused? or just race my heart? or affect me a random ass way?

				What I want to know more specifically is if the amphetamine might work in a negative way for any reason and/or if it will help focus all my thoughts on my homework and not on external things
