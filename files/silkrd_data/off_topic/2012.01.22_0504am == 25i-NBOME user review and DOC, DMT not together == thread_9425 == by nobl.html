				Hello all.<br />I would like to post my genuine account of 750ug 25i-NBOME sourced from a top ranking vendor on SR. Given the substance, it should not be hard to deduce the vendor in question, but i won&#039;t drop the exact name, but there is a lot of likeness to the uh prod...you get the idea.&nbsp; Hoping this is posted in right section - I have used forums before but lost my account so just made anew for this.<br /><br />My history, i am a sub 30yo male of reasonable health from northern calif. I am an intellectual of sorts and i have, i consider, good to excellent mental and motor control. First i&#039;ll also give very brief overviews of more recent drug experiences, DMT and DOC, also new to me, and a brief comparison with other drugs as to how i have experienced them.<br /><br />I had not drunk substantially until 18, and began smoking herbs at around 19, doing that regularly since - Mostly daily however last 2 years i have lessened it to 1 or 2 hits per evening to take an edge off with a beer. I began experimenting with local mdma at about 21 and the quality varied highly, i&#039;m fairly certain at one stage i had a small amount of paint, but i experienced many euphoric, god like moments at the height of a pot binge whilst rolling on a decent e. I found the fuzzy, warm physical effects and spiritual thought searching and air&#039;ness of thought to be the best experience of everything to date, however i always longed for a highly visual architectual type hallucinatory experience, the type sometimes gotten in lucid dreams whilst first time-like highs on pot before the frequency increased and pot became more of a dull substance - the dreamed out type states whilst listening to things like dj shadow or the doors with closed eye lucid dream visuals. I will say, that perhaps the best most interesting experience was just stoned, listening to dj shadow in the dark, one of the first time highs on some very high quality bush grown, in comparison, i see E as having good internal resolution capabilities. Unfortunately for both drugs, i see them as having residual addictive qualities. You still crave more later, and the e come down next day is not good, i recommend only taking E when you have 2 days off work to recover.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read alot of books that talk about these, what i can seem to only grasp a concept of, long vast landscape like visuals, not just flashes or colours,, being in the moment. amongst other hallucinations as i mentioned i had briefly experienced this type of thing in first time pot high&#039;s. I also was eager to have open eye halucinations, just to experience them. The best i had gotten off e and weed with open eye visuals, was mild colour distortions, or the feeling of floating up off the earth when looking at the stars in a dark place, no actual halucinations as such, just minor perspective and colour perception distortion and variation, no kaleidoscopes etc.<br /><br />I have also had my fair share of experience with crys smoked, and other than the talkative an energetic nature of the drug first few times in large groups of people, i find this drug to be horrid, uncontrollable and just fiendlike. I definetly preferred the one type hit and roll away of an e and some herb. I don&#039;t feel to be god like or the sort, i feel like i become a shell on this, a shell with energy, no spirit at all. I don&#039;t recommend anybody get into this drug, personally, if your seeking a spiritual experience, never go near crys, it will destroy you internally, this is my belief and experience.<br /><br />I got onto sr in the hope of finding mdma of good quality, and ordered 5 doc x 1mg tabs, and tried 1&nbsp; about 3 months ago. It was similiar to e, but noth the same, more like a smaller brother with less effects. I kept the dosage to a minimum, there was a higher clarity of music but nothing to rave about. I won&#039;t discount the substance, but i&#039;ve had bad experiences with unknowns so i limited myself with this due to the unknowns. One thing i did find off the DOC, was an appreciation for sun light shining through a water droplet on a leaf after i watered the garden. The smell of the garden, it was great - I never water the garden. It was almost one of those moments, it was close. I&#039;ll rate DOC to be a potential e like candidate.<br /><br />I then tried DMT freebase a few weeks later, hoping for a god like, and or hallucinatory exp. i tried smoking it on glassware, the taste was acrid and putrid. I hit it atop of some weed, and i remember saying, &#039;this is the fasted i have ever accelerated, whilst sitting still.&#039; It was like i got rocketed at 1000km/h without moving. Everything was looping expanding contracting, sound was distorted. I didn&#039;t like it as much, it was over whelming. I experienced open eye visuals from this that i had sought, but i didn&#039;t enjoy them. I was concerned that, if i was seeing this, was it possible i have broken my ability to see normally. At this point, i recognized that i do not like open eye visuals, for we need to be able to see clearly and normally to function and survive. Anything which damages that ability, i suddenly did not like or want to experience - I had not considered this in the past when seeking to experience open eye visuals. I knew it would stop, but i suddenly appreciated only seeing what is there. I found E to enhance what you see to be more beautiful, whereas DMT, made everything move, i saw patterns, moving, like one of those visual hallucination images that move without moving, except everything was doing it. All in all, even though lasting only some 25 minutes, i didn&#039;t overly enjoy dmt, again it didn&#039;t feel overly spiritual or internally warming.<br /><br />My friends had sourced lsd recently, and talked of open eye visuals, and a connection between them, throwing things randomly and somehow others catching it, a partnering subconscious connection, knowing what to say before saying it. I sought this, with the feeling and warmth and godlikeness and closed eye long spanning beauty images.<br /><br /><br /><br />I read, and decided to go with 25i-NBOME in 750ug. Because of the minimal effects of DOC, i would again try bucally, but i thought i would be game and try 2 of the squares as i didn&#039;t feel very overwhelmed off the DOC i tried.<br />Upon recieving the lots of 25i, i tried half of one. My method of intake was bad, and i recieved no effects for the night whatsoever. I was subsequently sceptical of the dose and susbtance itself.<br /><br />About 2 weeks later, i decided to have another run at it, but properly this time. I got more than i ever bargained for, ever.....EVER...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EVER.<br /><br />When i tried the doc, i held on tongue like a pill. I read this was not correct method.<br /><br />0h, 0min: At about 10 am on a saturday, i placed 2 of the 750ug paper nbome tabs in between my front lower lip, and my teeth, but lower than my teeth in my gum. I seated it well so they wouldn&#039;t move or get hydrated from salivia, as i found the doc tabs detiorated. As they are part cardboard like, i was confident i could keep them mostly dry and in tact in this location.<br />At the time i couldn&#039;t smoke pot at my home, so i I then immediately drove to my preferred spot to smoke some herb, about 5 minutes away from home, and a moderately safe drive, although a few traffic lights, nothing very intense, i would say, minor to moderate traffic interaction - Easily navigable though so i saw as safe. - I am sure this will attract some comments, all i can say, is i am very experienced driving whilst under, and it was the judgement call i made. ..... My intention was to only go, smoke 2 or 3 and return home, not more than about 15m from initial ingestion, risk seemed low. From there i would retire to my room. That was the plan.<br /><br />0h, 5min: I arrived at the location, and sat for a few minutes. There was a few people in the area, so i waited, it was a warmish day, i felt a little strange, probably the anticipation and angst i thought. No major effects, perhaps very slightly giddy and eager to smoke and go without raising any attention, i prefer to be discreet. I smoked two small amounts of average weed. Upon exhaling the second hit, i started to feel a little bit like on dmt, in terms of acceleration and weighted like. It wasnt intense and didn&#039;t last long, perhaps just exagerated stoneness. The smoke seemed a bit harsher than regular. I went for a third, upon blowing out, i started to feel the effects more amplified. I decided this was enough, i was feeling a bit heavy, decided to return home now. Again, no visuals, just a slightly strange feeling. <br />At this stage, i decided to remove the tabs too, just incase my driving was slightly impaired, they would have been present there for about 10 minutes. Upon removing, the bitter taste of marmite or australla vegemite, a very particular tasting breakfast spread i had once. It has a strange smell and taste, it tasted identicial to this, very bitter, almost stinging like on the location i had the tabs placed. They were mostly still in tact, but then, my gums started to feel like they had glue applied to the front part of my lower lip, they felt stiff and hard (not glued together though.) I tried licking, removing the taste and feeling to no avail. I decided it best to return home. I am a very cautious driver. I could feel impairment, so i drove very cautiously, taking good time to judge gap awareness and speeds. The traffic seemed to be much more now. I felt almost drunk, but knew i could function okay, just ensuring to remain focused only on driving. No radio or phones etc, i felt it requiring most strict concentration.<br /><br />0h, 10-15min; At this stage, about&nbsp; half way home, navigating the lights was easy, but seemed to be taking a very long time for greens. No halucinations, but i felt that my awareness and ability to concentrate was impaired, so i ensured to remain focused and appear normal, which was easy, however i did have the feeling i could easily draw attention to myself if i did not concentrate, at this stage nothing to suggest this was happening. Then, whilst waiting at a red light, sitting, i noticed that part of the blue interior in my car, seemed to be a very pronounced blue. It was almost as if the blue was shining at me, as if it wasn&#039;t just fabric, but it was one big light, shining at me. Not blinding, just, fairly bright. I suddenly became a little concerned. I suddenly realized it best to go directly home with absolute urgency, no distractions or deviations, and to immediately stop driving. The rest of the drive home, the 2 minutes was perhaps the longest of my life. Every moment, i became concerned to check the light was green as i drove through, to check my speed. I believe my driving was actually fine, but internally, my caution perception was at extreme. I arrived home safely, and got out of the car, and proceeded to walk quickly to my room.<br /><br />

				continued..<br /><br />0h, 20min: My legs felt uneasy, i almost could not walk. It was my house, i knew the location of my room, but there was no memory, i was on auto pilot to survive, to get to isolation.<br /><br />I got to my room, and put music on and laid down.<br />By now i was feeling, bad, regretful. I laid for about 20 minutes, possibly slept briefly in this time. Confusion had taken over, at about 40 minutes in. I decided to quickly take a shower. The water intruiged me, i found myself looking at the drops on my hands, it was, fascinating, but also, estranged.<br />I went back to my room, and turned my video camera on to record what would happen. I lied down, tried to sleep, it was restless. I fell asleep briefly, had a dream, could hear/ andor/ found myself, yelling out &#039;im sorry&#039;. Not sure why, presumably some sort of miscelanious dream like emotional release.<br /><br />0h, 40: I don&#039;t know how it happened, i must have started to play what i filmed for the past 10 minutes. I then became convinced i was now trapped in the video camera. What i was doing in real life, appeared to be playing on the video camera, as if i had it connected to a tv and was playing the capture. I presume this is because i initially waved at the camera when i first began recording. And whilst replaying this, in a state of delirium, i was waving at the camera, convinced i was both recording and playing what was happening. I was worried i was stuck in some kind of loop, destined to be trapped forever.<br />Delirium had clearly taken over in a big way. I tried to sleep, this did not work.<br />I got dressed, my jeans had slight tears in them at the bottom, as a result of a mangled home modification job. They had splits up both sides of the bottom, i had never liked the poor job i did on them.<br />&nbsp;I put my sandals on, and walked outside. Suddenly, i looked down, my jeans were the most vibrant yet dull blue. It occured to me, they looked like new retro flares, the fabric suddenly seemed soft and nice. I realised i was elvis re incarnated. Every motion of my moves was so purposeful, blissful, perfect. I could have been on stage, performing, i had never felt this before. I knew what it felt like, to be evlis, to be 70&#039;s, to be trend. I can&#039;t imagine what my neighbours may have thought if they saw me. I was possibly moon walking. It felt like my every move was a magical dance move. Existing was strictly awesome.<br /><br />1h: It started to sprinkle rain. A small drop landed on my face. I was intruiged, amazed, it was a foreign concept to me, i didn&#039;t know what this thing was, or how it happened. I realised, i had lost all language, all ability to communicate, and all memory. I was existing, like a lost animal, in a foreign place. I had my phone on me, and began calling contacts. One by one, it rang, and rang out. I desperately needed picking up, i needed to escape this house, and go to where people were that would understand.<br /><br />Words had no meaning, i knew what i needed and where to go, but couldn&#039;t communicate, i&#039;m doubtful i could have spoken words. I thought i was an ant. I could climb buildings, the perspectives seemed neutral to gravity. I was sure my hands and feet had enough surface grip and contact to climb walls. I could have been spider man. The task seemed too trivial to prove, i understood how to evade any of the &#039;limitations&#039;&nbsp; previously percieved in our universe.<br /><br />At this time, i had, essentially, near on, or complete memory loss. I have experienced amnesia and getting knocked unconscious, would liken it to this, and or someone with dimentia. I was very scared and concerned, and at the same time, had the freedom of absolutely no worries or self perception issues i have carried for most of my life. All the past issues disappeared with a loss of memory. All i knew, was that i was the all seeing, all doing, magical man, i could have persuaded the hottest girl to have the most magical sex ever at this stage, i was elvis, god, the spirit of every thing animal and person all rolled in one. I was an alien, a creature, unexplicable, i was not normal.<br />Self image has generally been a problem for me, confidence is not always great. This was like a spirit speaking through my body, i don&#039;t know if it was me or not, but it was a manifestation of something. I felt i was on the border line, of someone who would wake up naked in a field somewhere. I was concerned, worried i would never recover or get memories back, and that i would do something very bad and/or stupid, especially living along a busy street.<br /><br />1h, 30min: I managed to get hold of a friends girlfriend. I told her to come immediately, she told me she would be 10 minutes.<br /><br />I then found a tear come across my eye.<br />I looked through it, as it passed through my central visual area. Light shone through the tear drop, the light was a translucent, opaque, clear, white like clear colour. I can only say, it was a colour that i had never seen before, likely never see again. I was told, it was the light of god, and i was blessed to see what others do not see. I was told the light existed, however, we do not normally percieve this colour or light. It was like the colour of lightning, a plasmic whitish blue, but not bright, tolerable, tangible, beautiful, the most beautiful thing i have ever seen. I could see information embedded in the light - I did not see numbers or letters, i could feel the information, i could feel the awareness and &#039;downloading&#039;. The answer to every question i have ever had. The light almost knocked me off my feet. The voice i could hear, i could not actually hear it, not audible from external, or from an internal source. It was like a memory of a voice, like hearing without hearing. I was told infinite books of information in this split second. I recieved some sort of holy answers to my seeking of questions. <br /><br />I was told to appreciate life, and i recognized why i had done any and all drugs in the past. It was like the one panaceic moment i had yearned for. I didn&#039;t need, or want pot to have closed eye visuals, mdma to speak or feel god, crys to talk to people, lsd to see visual landscapes. None of that mattered, i recognized and forgave myself for everything until this point, and told myself that this was what i had yearned for. In part, perhaps, it was my brain, providing me with a moment so as to relax the ongoing requirement and search, and perhaps, it was a downloading around my subconcious. Really i don&#039;t have a specific answer, but that moment, was nothing but magic for me. I do honestly believe i recieved some sort of divine information in that moment, within that light that i saw, weather real or perceieved. I am without a doubt nobody else would have actually seen that beam of light, but weather or not it existed, i leave open for interpretation, all i know, is something that i will likely never experience again occured in my plain backyard at that moment.<br /><br />I walked to the front. I almost walked onto the road. Sit down, and wait, i told myself. Luckily i avoided the hectic traffic, everything was so dangerous, and so quickly moving. The cars, and use of such dangerous mechanisms as automobiles seemed to rediculous to me, the rush of the world, why so impatient. I couldn&#039;t see the point, it was death, everywhere, the potential to be run over. The world seemed so obscure, what was wrong with sitting and walking everywhere i thought. But i also knew this was not partical, i would surely not survive. Looking back, i was probably in a delirious state not unlike that in fear and loathing in las vegas.<br /><br />I can only suggest i had the mental capacity of a small child or a stray dog. I still knew concepts of people, and how to say words i needed to say, but it was out of desperation, other than this, functionality and language ability and motor control was abstract and for the best part, non existant - I could still walk, walking felt, correct, wrong, challenging, and seemed to happen without thinking. When your very drunk, you can walk, it&#039;s a challenge to stand upright due to balance control. This was more about, weather or not i was in my body, and if i was making it happen, and exactly what &#039;i&#039; was. Contemplation of the universe was not really taking place. The world, the universe, was an impossible concept. <br /><br />~2hrs: The girl drove past, she had to pick up my friend first. I watched her drive past, the look on her face, comical, like she was laughing at me. I can only imagine how i must have looked, at 1pm in the daytime, jeans, sandals and a hoodie covering my head. I tried to wave, i felt incapacitated.<br /><br />I saw other cars, i thought i recognized the faces. I felt my friends were driving past, laughing at me and mocking me. I told myself this was delussional.<br />Finally, the car pulled into the driveway. In one burst of energy, i walked/ran to the car, trying to appear as normal as possible, trying to minimize posability and time for people to view me.<br />I got into the car, a foreign space ship, and told them to drive. This was all i could manage to say.<br /><br />They began driving, and asked if i was okay, if i needed taking to the hospital. I told them i didn&#039;t know what a hospital was, but that i didn&#039;t like the sound of it. I said that i &quot;did not know what a &#039;wig out&#039; was, but that i think i might be experiencing one.&#039; - In those specific words.<br /><br />&nbsp;I had trouble using language and grasping words. I seemed only able to respond, not to formulate questions or sentences. Yes, no, dont, stop. I used them with random discretion, perhaps not completely appropriately or in the correct usage, to convey a general feeling.<br /><br />They attempted to explain the concept of a hospital to me, and discussed my condition and cause for concern, they noted some delirium and general dismay, and questioned what i had done and or taken to establish the concern. They later said i was happy, euphoric, like someone at the height of an exteme extacy trip, but, confused, using the most strange words. At one stage, they reclaim, i told them i was elvis and the living reincarnation of some of the current prominent hip hop artists, and that i requested they take me to an audience so i could perform. They seemed to think i was having an ongoing orgasm over everything i saw, touched, felt. I could see that all in the car were in awe of the experience, it was something i imagine every human deep down craves. But the experience for me ran far deeper than some physical pleasure experience, however good simply sitting and being felt.<br /><br />I debated the notion of a hospital, and my condition, and told them to go to my friends house who had taken lsd previously, they would understand. Despite my loss of memory, i decided i needed time. They Turned the car around, and i explained what i had taken. The substance name was foreign to them, i told them it was akin to LSD, they became understanding.<br />The world outside of the car was non existant. Only the car existed, the sound of the car, the feel of the interior and my clothes. I bumped my head against my friend in a plaful fashion, as if we were brothers. I do not normally act in a playful manner. I told my friend he was the best person, and asked him what he had in his hand. A large glass, of burboun and coke mix. I asked to taste it, as i had not seen or experienced this thing before. The smell was amazing, a small sip, it was the first thing i had ever tasted, it was glorious, amazing. I wanted to drink more, but i savoured the tiny taste.<br /><br />We arrived at my friends, 4 or so people came to the front lawn presumably sensing the oncoming chaos from my previous call attempts.<br />I collapsed/exploded out of the door onto the lawn, and crawled to the feet of my friends and hugged them, told them i loved them all. They told me to come inside as as to not cause a scene, and near on carried me through the front door.<br /><br />I laid on the couch.<br />~2hrs 20mins: I tried to stay localized to the couch, for atleast good few hours. Some music was played, tv, movies computer games. Everything was foreign. My friends had questions, i did not have answers for. Re gaining my memory, and languge ability would take time, i just waited. The concern of residual brain damage was a constant theme in my thoughts.<br /><br />~4 hours: I had begun to regain some sense of normalcy. Images on the tv had tracers, multiple frames, colours were technocolour. Walls etc had stopped breathing and moving, things seemed to be slowly coming down, but my ability to process general norms was still affected. At one stage, a friend offered me a tin of food. It said salmon and beans on the side. I managed to open the tin using the ring pull. It came with a plastic spork.<br />I smelt it, and said it smelt to be like cat food. The fact there was no cat at this house did not occur to me. I was suspicous it was a prank.<br />I checked the box thoroughly It had serving portions and no mention of cat food. I was still cautious, that perhaps it was so obviously cat food that it was not actually visible to me.<br />Eventually, i conceeded that cats could not use sporks, and i ate the food. it tasted nurtitional and wholesome. I resided that my diet was poor and to eat better in future.<br /><br />~4 hours 30 mins: We began discussing work. I could recall my place of work, and my role, but i did not understand the context within society. Daily operations seemed foreign. I could not remember or understand why computers existed or why the internet was or did or it&#039;s functional role in our communnity, or other commonplace equipment and technology. I slowly built on concepts of understanding, and things began coming back to me. I would have had trouble dealing with abstract concepts i had not yet built upon, understanding of things seemed to be growing via associations of understanding. I understood cars, because they take us to places, but it seemed unreasonable to want to travel. Aeroplanes were a larger expansion of this, why we seek to travel so. The concept of a rocket to the moon seemed rediculous, but boats had a sense of rationality.<br /><br />~8 hours. I don&#039;t recall much after this point, except that i had somewhat began to heal. After about the 6 hour mark, things were just a gradual decline. I had been devloping a pressure like headache in the back of my head since about the 4 hour mark, which had ruined any positive physical feeling, my brain appeared to be hurting. I waited for sleep, which came long and slowly. I smoked a small amount of marijuana, which seemed to re intensify effects. The headache became slightly worse, but after about 2 hours, i managed to sleep.<br /><br />~ 18h mark, wake up next day after about 6-8 hours of sleep give or take. <br />i felt good, refreshed, headache had disappated. I did not want any drugs, period, I felt refreshed, long to live a drug free life for the rest of my life.<br />I decided, i would have one very small bong hit, just to confirm or deny the feeling. It might seem unusual, my choice, but it was one of those, must do type things. I had the smallest portion of weed, and instantly the headache returned, not quiet as bad. I decided my suspicioun was correct, i vowed not to smoke indefinetly.<br />The headache mostly subsided but did still linger for the rest of the day, i did some mundane activities, and retired early on the sunday, worn out and partially oblivious to the awesomeness of the experience.<br /><br />Something happened over the next week that had been a serious rareity for the past 5 or so years.<br />I had ocasional spots of non smoking for a week here and there, with anxst, itchy feet and annoyance etc. This week, i breazed through without so much as thinking about smoking pot. It was like it had been banished from my life, like what you would expect from hypnotherapy of an unseen level. Absolutely no hesitation, no need to drink in it&#039;s place. I was happy simply experiencing life.<br /><br />The following week, i saw my mates on a thursday, and agreed to smoke a very small amount. 1 week and 4 days, and i smoked the tiniest amount. I didn&#039;t feel great, i regretted doing it.<br />The next 2 weeks followed with more abstinence. For the ongoing pot smoker, you may read this, and relate or desire to feel this. I will comment re this further below.<br /><br />This is the reason i listed my experiences at the start of this story. I in part, regret taking the amount that i did, but i think the fact it literally wiped my memory, it did something no other substance has done. There was absolutely no desire for repeat of this substance, aside from the god like moment, which i decided was a once off thing i doubt i could, or will, or desire to repeat.<br /><br />I found initially when first taking E, that you wake up the next day with a bounce, as if you havent smoked weed before, like the fog is clear. The problem with E, is it has residual qualities. I took E partly to crave or find a new feeling, partly, eventually, for that next day clarity away from weed, and to break the weed cycle. I found, over time, E would make me smoke copious more amounts of weed in order to intensify the feeling and mood of the night.<br />E can be great, definetly is a godlike substance.<br />But based on my experience with 25i, this for me, by far has been the most awesome, out there, psychadelic, scary, eye opening, educating, visual, halucinatory drug i have ever come across. Potency, mood, experience, it is like a hurricane in a handbag.<br /><br />If your honestly dealing with long term emotional problems, addiction to substance etc, and feel that you&#039;ve tried other things, i do honestly believe 25i could be a potential candidate for an experience that will help you deal with these addictions.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a good 3 months since my experience, and in that time since i had a month long period of infrequent smoking, and also some small interaction with the crys, however, i have not smoked weed in over a month and a half as of writing this today, and the small interaction i did have with crys, was absolutely minimal, and not uncontrolled and fiendlike compared with previous interactions. I have absolutely no doubt that my perspective and outlook has changed dramatically. Something greatly changed in my life in that experience, and to be 1.5months green smoke free basically cold turkey, is something that i know many regular stoners would be in awe of.<br /><br />I have started drinking a little more beer, in that it&#039;s not uncommon to have 1 r 2 beers a night, but i don&#039;t drink to excess, and some other things have changed in my life that it&#039;s been deemed reasonable to. I am quiet certain in the next month or two i will reduce the frequency of drinking to a more weekend thing, and its use doesn&#039;t concern me, it&#039;s more of a with dinner type event.<br /><br />This has been my experience, and i do suggest, if you intend on experimenting especially with 25i, or also dmt, you really, really, need to mentally prepare yourself, environment, have a long term ie 20h time plan, and most of all, understand that absolutely no mental planning at all will prepare you for what you are most likely to experience. And don&#039;t take 2 like i did, this was an obvious mistake.<br /><br />I also did try LSD, 1 tab, about 3 weeks later, from a reputable seller, and the visual effects in terms of technocolour and frames, walls breathing, confusion etc were very similiar, and i laughed my ass off for Hours, however i didn&#039;t recieve the spiritual awakening, and i again got the headache. Following that, was around the time i decided pschyadelics weren&#039;t my thing, the risk of ongoing damage to our precious consciousness and brain seemed like too much to risk, this is just my opinioun.
