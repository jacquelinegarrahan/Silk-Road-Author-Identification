				I&#039;m really loving all of the choices on SR and I&#039;m interested in trying new things. I was wondering what the difference is between DMT trip and the K Hole that comes with K or MXE. Am I right that you get the same feeling with both, but the DMT has the added bonus of visuals?

				If you get enough DMT on the first hit, and you&#039;re using a vaporizer, and you go &#039;behind the veil&#039;, you won&#039;t be thinking &quot;oh these are nice visuals&quot;. It&#039;s more of &quot;I just got a glimpse of the underlying fabric of the universe&quot;, except more ineffable. A monotheist might think of it as &#039;becoming god&#039;. <br /><br />Haven&#039;t taken K or MXE and don&#039;t plan to, but from what I&#039;ve seen/heard from others it&#039;s not particularly enlightening, although perhaps it can be. I never saw the appeal, maybe someone else can enlighten us.<br /><br />My 3 DMT &#039;breakthroughs&#039; (I&#039;ve tried ~20 times) were more intense than everything else I&#039;ve ever experienced, combined. I recommend DMT over K or MXE (or anything else for that matter), with the caveat that no matter how hard you try you will not be able to communicate the quality or intensity of the experience to others (unless perhaps they&#039;ve been there themselves).<br />

				DMT and ketamine are very different. Do some reading on erowid.org about each of them. <br /><br />DMT is my favorite drug of all time. Crossing the veil is by far the most magical, spiritual, religious experience I have ever had. Each time has been just indescribable. Fucking amazing stuff. When smoked at small doses it almost feels like an intense mushroom trip. I highly recommend not starting with a small hit - it can be uncomfortable when you only smoke a little, like paranoid and anxious. If you take a large amount it becomes much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Have you ever tried salvia and really lost your shit? Like feeling that the universe is collapsing and you are stuck in an infinite look of chaos and death? DMT is the only drug I have tried which is comparable in complete loss of reality. Whereas salvia (imo) sends you to a nightmare universe, DMT send you to a universe full of magic and other beings. <br /><br />Psychedelics and dissociatives are entirely different.

				So it sounds like DMT is something that should not be taken alone.

Unless the other people around you are also taking it.

				Thanks guys for the replies. I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll freak out the first time if I&#039;m alone. How do I prevent a bad trip if I&#039;m alone?

How do I prevent a bad trip if I&#039;m alone?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In my experience there are two ways to have a bad trip: 1. You don&#039;t get enough to &#039;break through&#039; and you&#039;re just intoxicated for 15 minutes (which isn&#039;t bad but it&#039;s disappointing which feeds back and can lead to a &#039;bad trip&#039;). 2. You attempt it twice within a short period of time; the second time will be disorienting, with a bunch of random sounds going off in the left side of your head, and you&#039;ll be really disappointed. <br /><br />So vaporize it (ideally in a vaporgenie), take it ALL on the first hit (or two), and hold the hit until no vapor comes out. How fast you do it, how much gets destroyed in the process, and how well you hold it is more important than how much you pack into the bowl.
