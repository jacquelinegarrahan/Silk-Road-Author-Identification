				I&#039;m an experienced tripper, I know myself well and am comfortable with most emotions a trip forces me to confront. However, I have been in a bit of a deep slump since the onset of some romantic uncertainty with my long-time partner beginning a few days ago. I feel undervalued, worried for her, and lacking the significant outlet for sharing my emotions that she has been for me. <br /><br />My best friend and I had plans to take eat some magic mushrooms tomorrow. I&#039;m worried because many of the feelings in my current state occur in spite of what I may know or think about myself, and I&#039;m afraid that in a trip, I would think the worst without the core self-valuing that always allows me to withstand the worst of a trip. I have had several of what some would call a &quot;bad trip&quot; but I would rather call formative and spiritually confrontational. This time, I&#039;m afraid of just plain having a bad trip. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure a number of you have been in similar positions- did you go ahead with it? Did you manage alright? Any words of encouragement (or discouragement) you may have for me?<br /><br />

				maybe you should postpone the trip for a little while. I&#039;ve never had a particularly bad trip, but if you have a lot of worries on your mind, they can come back and haunt you. At the very least don&#039;t go overboard with the hallucinogens if u got worries on yo mind

				I also think it might be a good idea to postpone your trip until you are in a more stable head space. <br /><br />Psychedelics have a way of getting your brain caught in a &quot;thought loop&quot; and if you&#039;re already in a negative head space, its more likely that you might get caught in a negative loop. Also one of the surest ways to have a bad trip is to be scared of having a bad trip.<br /><br />But, of course, ultimately its your decision.

				Oh, I feel for you... I really hope things become happier soon.<br /><br />I sincerely recommend that you postpone the trip.<br /><br />Personally things become magnified when tripping - If I am feeling happy, I become ecstatic. If I and feeling cold, or sad, things feel very uncomfortable. I have had some very sad experiences when im shrooming... and the last thing you want is one of these lest something goes wrong. <br /><br />You sound like you need some good people around you, some really nice friends... maybe go do something very sober, go for a nice walk, get some takeaways and a few beers and have a few laughs.<br /><br />Take care out there traveler.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I recently staved off a trip this week due to the same circumstances. Although trips have helped me through situations like this in the past, none have been as difficult as this but something in my subconscious is telling me to just hold off until it all is sorted.

				Well I have tripped at times when some of the tragic events in my life have affected me,and I did find psychedelics healing but it did take very dark and sinister turns during the course of my trips given the mental condition I was in,but the journey was something I wanted to go through and emerge,<br /><br />Be prepared if you do want to trip under circumstances such as a Broken Heart,it has its reward at the end or might not give you any answers<br /><br />Trip safe,
