				&quot;Paranoia strikes deep, into your life it&#039;s bound to creep, it comes when you&#039;re always afraid, step outta line the man come and he takes you away.&quot; -CSN<br /><br />Try to do something to help some people and the haters step up. <br /><br />&quot;how much juice you take out.......I WOULD WANT A HERO MEMBER OR ADMIN. CONTROLLING THIS NOR SOME NOOOOOB&quot;<br />Say freelife1(all in small letters for a small mind), when you base your decisions in life on a persons posts on a silly forum you reveal your smallness in the world. I could provide the referrals from some of the most respected vendors on SR but I was right in the first place, this isn&#039;t the time. Read the entire post it says I would not be playing.<br />&quot;Curious, are you Filipino?&quot;<br />Curious, minorthreat71, are you racist? <br /><br />&quot;So often the most hypocrisy found is strongest where those who cry for its removal gather.&quot; - Scarecrow, 2012<br /><br />Too many fools on this corner for this Scarecrow to hangout. <br /><br /><br />I FIND MYSELF WISHING I HAD MORE BITCOINS AND FIGURE I CAN&#039;T BE SO UNIQUE. HERE IS A CHANCE FOR EVERYONE TO GET A CHANCE TO INCREASE THEIR WALLET SIZE. <br />1. SEND ONE BITCOIN TO:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br />2. WATCH THIS POST EVERY MONDAY NIGHT AT 9:00 PM CST FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHO HAD THEIR NAME DRAWN. THAT&#039;S IT ONE WINNER TAKES ALL. THEY WILL ALREADY BE IN THE RANDOMLY DRAWN WINNERS WALLET.<br />3. KEEP IT SIMPLE - NO WHINING OR CRYING ALLOWED - IT IS WHAT IT IS. IF YOU DON&#039;T TRUST THIS TO BE ON THE UP THEN PLEASE DO NOT PLAY. OR WAIT A COUPLE WEEKS TO SEE IF IT SEEMS TO BE COOLIO.<br />THANKS AND I HOPE IT IS NOT AGAINST THE RULES. NP, I WONT BE PLAYING.
