				Before anyone says anything, I understand the rules and I am in no way offering anyone counterfeit money, nor am I speaking about spreading it via the Silk Road.<br /><br />Basically, here is the situation.&nbsp; I have been doing business with someone for 2 years.<br /><br />The long and short of it is he paid me with 25,000$ in 100&#039;s USD, that I believed to be 100% legitimate bills.<br />I tried depositing a few of them, and it turns out they are counterfeit. What is known as supernotes. I of coarse tried to find him, yet it would seem he has disappeared. Along with my product.<br /><br />I need to somehow get rid of this money and have the most amount possible. So I can hopefully forget about this situation as soon as possible.<br /><br />I can&#039;t get rid of it just by spending as that would literally take years. Passing bills here and there would keep me in this bad situation. I thought about selling them on BMR, but unfortunately from the rates counterfeits go for on there, my 25k will turn into, ~7k.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas or am I pretty much screwed? Honestly a website like zoklet bad ideas would be the place for this, but unfortunately they don&#039;t allow new registration.<br /><br />IF YOUR GOING TO COMMENT JUST TO DENY THE LEGITIMACY OF THE POST, THEN DON&#039;T BOTHER

				They are not supernotes if you or a bank could tell they are fake.&nbsp; Supernotes are higher quality than real bills.

				There is no such thing as more high quality than a real note. The goal of counterfeit money is to pass as real money. If it is &quot;better&quot; than real money it can be told apart. Man made diamonds are less flawed than real diamonds, and this lets them be identified by skilled jewelers. Supernote can be identified as well, but only by top experts after very careful examination. Very unlikely this guy has supernotes if his bank identified them.

				high quality counterfeit would generally be taken to mean a counterfeit that is passable as the real thing, with a higher quality counterfeit being more passable than a lower quality counterfeit, and a higher quality counterfeit requiring more skilled experts / tools to differentiate it from real notes. Thus it seems nonsensical to say a counterfeit can be higher quality than a real note, since being anything that differentiates it from a real note would make it identifiable and thus not a perfect quality counterfeit. I didn&#039;t realize you were talking about the quality of the images printed onto the notes, I thought you meant the quality of the counterfeit notes.

				Honestly when comparing these bills side by side with real money, I can&#039;t tell the difference. Iv never seen fake money like this. The bills were caught because of an issue with the serial numbers. Also, just as added info, the bank wouldn&#039;t give me the bills back and police were called etc...<br /><br />Assuming the bills I perfect, any ideas on passing all of them? The western union idea sounds plausible. The thing is that when the store goes to deposit the money into the bank, it would come up counterfeit, and I could see serious problems with my fingerprints all over the money. Unless I somehow where gloves when I hand over the money to western union?<br />I would use fake ID to send the money, which wouldn&#039;t be an issue, as iv sent money via western union with fake ID before.<br />Is there a limit on transactions? <br /><br />Only plausible thing I could think of is going into a western union wearing:<br />http://www.spfxmasks.com/ourmasks.php<br /><br />And sending it all to a bitcoin vendor that accepts western union.

The western union idea sounds plausible. The thing is that when the store goes to deposit the money into the bank, it would come up counterfeit, and I could see serious problems with my fingerprints all over the money. Unless I somehow where gloves when I hand over the money to western union?<br />I would use fake ID to send the money, which wouldn&#039;t be an issue, as iv sent money via western union with fake ID before.<br />Is there a limit on transactions? <br /><br />Only plausible thing I could think of is going into a western union wearing:<br />http://www.spfxmasks.com/ourmasks.php<br /><br />And sending it all to a bitcoin vendor that accepts western union.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If the bank caught these... I&#039;m pretty sure the WU will as well, no?<br />

				If you could mail them to an address in another country and use it to buy something there. Then return with what you bought that seems like it would work. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve thought of a million different things by now though. <br /><br />Before the big head bills came out I used to make my own money. Remember those 20&#039;s before the strip was included? Not going into detail but it worked for everything I needed to on the street at the time. Spent it at raves and on lots and lots of drugs. Also at strip clubs and bars and never heard a peep. <br /><br />**Please don&#039;t judge me on that. I was young and stupid at the time. ***

				Drip superglue on your fingertips, wait for it to dry and you won&#039;t live fingerprints.<br /><br />Go to a used car dealer and buy a car.&nbsp; They are hungry for cash and will take it by the buckets.&nbsp; Then resell the car, or if you need money fast have it scrapped.&nbsp; You will only need to do this a few times to get rid of all the money.<br /><br />I would do it out of state.

				You&#039;re going to have to hit the street and pull some moves, a kilo here a kilo there and pay cash, of course the street dealers aren&#039;t going to be able to spot them are they??<br />Then you open a vendor account and sell the product you purchased with your fakes&nbsp; ;)

				Just a thought - put glue on your fingertips, wait for it to dry, go to a casino or two &quot;disguised&quot; - meaning wearing different clothes than you usually would, maybe fake mustache and facial moles, trade the bills for chips and cash out an hour later?

				Yea casinos are a huge no go. Esp the ones in Vegas. Cameras covering every square inch, facial recognition, and some high speed software that pics up on biometrics of people that are nervous/doing shady shit.

				what about a casino on an Indian reservation or Niagara or some non-Vegas place. Try one bill mixed in, if you get away with it try more at a time.
