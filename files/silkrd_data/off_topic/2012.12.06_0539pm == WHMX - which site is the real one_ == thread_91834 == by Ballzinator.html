				I&#039;ve never used nor heard of either, but If I had to guess I&#039;d say &lt; http://whmxwxvfa2dves5k.onion/dollars.html &gt; is the legit one.<br /><br />The other one doesn&#039;t have a picture of the LED scanner to check quality on opening page, uses the email WHMX20@tormail instead of an original WHMX@tormail, states (in bad engrish) that the other site is indeed the scam which only gives me notions that it is the true scam site.<br />&nbsp;<br />Edit: After looking at both, now I don&#039;t really know. It&#039;s the email address that could only be the real defining factor. The scam message could actually be the owner of the site and he is just concerned about some mother fucker copying his site, but he just has poor grammar. Sorry man

Let me know when you want to go for it and I&#039;ll send you half the BTC to split the cost with you - I&#039;m in no rush! One thing that does concern me though is that they don&#039;t update the prices (as the site is made with images), but with the fluctuating value of Bitcoin, one would expect them to do so. As Bitcoin is increasing in value, this isn&#039;t much of an issue, but if BTC prices start declining and they don&#039;t update the note prices then that would be a cause for concern.<br /><br />Another possibility is that they set up the &#039;scammer&#039; site themselves in order to introduce an air of legitimacy to their own website. Generally speaking when you see a site warning you about a duplicate scam website that&#039;s out to steal your money, you&#039;ll start to trust them - they&#039;re introducing the idea that they are looking out for your interests, so you automatically become more complacent and begin trusting them.<br /><br />It&#039;s quite similar to the good cop / bad cop routine that police often use during questioning.

Id personally go for usd first rather than euros. Doesnt matter if you want euros in long term, save a bit of money and lets check out the cheaper ones first. BTW he says his usd are &quot;super dollars&quot; produced/purchased in Asia wheres as the euros they make themselves. MAKE SURE you take a tracking number. It will; cost 1 BTC to the EU and 1.5 BTC to worldwide.<br /><br />I am happy to contribute 1 BTC to the trial purchase. I think if everybody posts here if you want to add a coin to the purchase and then send it to Ballzinator or GG to do the deal?<br /><br /><br />1. GrahamGreene<br />2. Ballzinator<br />3. GrowHelp<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There is only 2.5 BTC difference between the prices of the EUR and USD notes, and I presume Ballzinator would be more comfortable identifying potential flaws on Euros than on dollars. The Euro notes would also likely be of more use to him.<br />As far as the issue of Super Dollars go, the only Super Dollars minted were $100 USD bills; the foremost theory is that they are minted by North Korea on the same presses used by the US Mint and distributed via North Korean diplomats to contacts in foreign embassies, notably Russia.<br /><br />The $20 bills are not Super Dollars, so this would give me even more reason to be wary. Did they specifically state that the 20&#039;s were?<br /><br />Your input is much appreciated though GrowHelp, as is your 1 BTC pledge.<br /><br />I would much rather Ballzinator go about this the way he wants to though - I don&#039;t want to handle other people&#039;s funds, and would be more than willing to fund half of the sample order, with Ballzinator perhaps taking contributions for the other half&nbsp; if he wishes to work it that way?<br /><br />This shouldn&#039;t really be under discussion in the forums though; I would suggest making a private messaging group, but that introduces concerns of its own regarding privacy issues and lack of openness. If we go about it that way then there would have to be strict rules governing it; no personal information to be revealed (name, address, age, precise geographical location etc.), no discussion of anything other than the idea of a &#039;group fund&#039; in order to mitigate individual losses on this purchase / the actual results of the purchase, and no person mentioning their Silk Road transactions, transaction history, messaging history or anything else of the sort.<br /><br />If we do wish to go down that route it would be important to act as though all of its members, including myself, are Law Enforcement. Closed groups attract these types of people and thanks to the anonymity provided by TOR and the internet in general, any one of us could indeed BE Law Enforcement.<br /><br />I welcome any suggestions or alterations to the above, or more pledges to contribute very small amounts of Bitcoin to this idea (with no BTC to be transferred to anyone until we sort out a &#039;plan of action&#039;.)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

Always have another real bill on hand so in case you&#039;re caught, you can still pay and take the fake one back and say you&#039;re gonna have its authenticity checked at a bank. Have only one fake bill on you at any time in case a checkout clerk calls the police. CCTV is your enemy. If you&#039;re gonna use the bills in a place where they have CCTV, wear completely different clothes every time and reveal as little of your identifiable features as possible. Use different combinations of head coverings, glasses, shoes and plain-colored clothes every time.<br />If caught, deny, deny, deny! Say you can&#039;t remember where you got the bill. It&#039;s also a good idea to not stash the bills at your home in case police obtain a search warrant (unlikely but I don&#039;t know what the laws are on this in different countries).<br />Did I forget anything?

				I have read a lot of feedback from different sites and forums, and so far it looks like WHMX do indeed produce counterfeits but its not of 10/10 quality. <br />Also a lot of packages have not been delivered, meaning either customs are on to it (highly unlikely) or they are selectively scamming people.<br /><br />Another thing I found is that the escrow that they use have an interesting small print. Stating in the events of buyer claim, if the seller declines to refund, Acrimonious escrow gets to keep all of the money. Which leads me to believe that WHMX and AE could be run by the same people.<br /><br />Be very careful!

				So does anybody have good news?<br /><br />Or what happened?<br /><br />Is this legit, or just another scam?

				Posted this in another thread, hoping to get the word out. Did an order, as of still I am confident that it is a scam and I won&#039;t get my money back $250 usd :/ I would much rather he never get any business again if that is the case, and I will let it be known. I&#039;m glad I only lost the $250. My experience:<br /><br />I have placed an order over a month ago, this time he used Acrimonous2. It seems he changes websites and escrow sites frequently. Needless to say I still didn&#039;t get any product.. He told me he had to cancel the transaction and &#039;hopes I get the refund&quot; I have still not received my refund, my transaction in escrow service was cancelled and Acrimonous2 is not responding to any of my messages. Definitely smells like a scam. I am trying to work with WHMX but if I don&#039;t get my money back soon I will be sure to make sure to get the word out.<br /><br />I will update if I do in fact get anything back, but I would hold onto your money until then.<br /><br />Btw this is the site I ordered from: <br />http://whmxwxv6lc22itzl.onion/dollars.html&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;he&#039;s the one with the whmx@lavabit and whmx20@tormail accounts<br /><br />But honestly I believe the two sites are one and the same. Reasoning behind this: if you look at the file names of the images, they are 1)identical and 2)the modified ones are saved as &quot;original image#+1&quot;. Would be simple for someone on the same computer to just one up the file when saving. Hope this makes sense.<br /><br />Note:Edited to add link
