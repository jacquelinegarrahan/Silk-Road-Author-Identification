				One benefit of having an ol&#039; lady entering her 30&#039;s is they turn into sexually charged teenage boys.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; I can hardly keep up anymore so I can&#039;t risk masturbating too much or she&#039;ll be pissed if I&#039;m not up for it.<br /><br />Yet drugs certainly enhance orgasm.<br /><br />Coke:&nbsp; Makes both of us depraived sexual deviants looking for group sex partners.&nbsp; Orgasms on coke are the best IMO.<br />MDMA:&nbsp; Good as well but not as good as coke.<br />LSD:&nbsp; Also can be great.

				Methaqualone is literally the best drug EVER made. I know most of you youngins dont know about the lemons. But, the best way I can put its like the best feeling the MDMA give you (that loving feeling) buy you can go to sleep at any time. Absolutely no harsh come down. Clean, clean, clean.....<br /><br />The last time I found it (about 8 years ago) me an my wife sat and talked for hours and just had a great ole time. then we fell asleep. I even hate comparing it to mdma (take the very best part of the mdma feeling and pretend it was mixed with benzos and opiates, thats what methaqualone feels like). Its such a wonderful feeling. I hope that I get to try it again someday....

				As both a &quot;sexually charged teenager&quot; female, as a previous post mentioned, I too get pissed when my bf masturbates in the shower and leaves me with none (and he, too, gets a choice of both!). However, for some reason my orgasms are always MOST intense after a day off benzos or opiates of any kind (I wouldn&#039;t say &#039;withdrawals&#039; so much.<br /><br />Also, the few times I tried amphetamines and would come-down, I&#039;d be able to have multiple, extremely intense orgasms, but never during the &quot;peak&quot; high.&nbsp; Summarily, EVERY drug (marijuana, opiates, benzos) makes it nearly impossible to orgasm while high.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried MDMA since the mid 90s, and never had sex. Might have to do so.

				There is an almost definite answer to this question, and that answer for the vast majority of people is methamphetamine. Any norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent like regular amphetamine or stronger is ideal. The reason why is because the good feelings you get during sex or masturbation are caused by dopamine release. Sex causes about a 200% increase in dopamine levels. Methamphetamine increases dopamine levels about 1200%, blowing any semi-common other drug out of the water pretty much. Due to the flood of norepinephrine, you will be super horny. Some people get so horny on meth all they can think about is getting poon or otherwise holding marathon masturbation sessions. That being said meth is toxic to the brain so you don&#039;t want to get in the habit of doing it... (easier said than done, btw I have never done meth but ive done a lot of regular amph and I also know everything about drugs).

				In my personal experience high doses of ritalin (methylphenidate), which is very similar chemically to cocaine, get me higher than amphetamine, but with a significantly more clouded mind. And it takes me like 15 minutes to get semi hard (I tried once lol) and thats about as good as it gets. And I don&#039;t feel horny at all, whereas amphetamine give me a minor to moderate urge to jerk the meat. Thing is I take max dose Cymbalta and Wellbutrin every day rx&#039;ed so that alters the experience (by making it a LOT stronger and longer lasting, about 8 hrs instead of 4, at the least).
