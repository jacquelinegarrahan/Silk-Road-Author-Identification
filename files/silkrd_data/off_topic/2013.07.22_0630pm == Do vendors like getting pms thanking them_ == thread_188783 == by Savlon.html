				I always wonder whether I should send a pm saying thanks to the vendor after I receive something. Especially if my experience with it was awesome. I mean I&#039;m sure they like getting thanked. Everyone likes it when people show gratitude but I can imagine it does get quite time consuming. I&#039;m sure vendors get lots and lots of PMs a day and I know it would get a bit irritating if you have to sift through however many thankyous before you get to something serious that needs responding to urgently.<br /><br />What are your thoughts?

				I send out thank-yous occasionally. <br />Noone has ever been offended by them but sometimes i dont get a response.<br /><br />I cant offer any advice from a vendors perspective as i am only a buyer.

				Good thread!&nbsp; Im the kind of customer that loves to thank vendors and give them feedback on their amazing products.&nbsp; Well all except those who have scammed me of course! but they usually delete their profiles before any foul mouth can begin and of course theres Strike, who doesnt check inbox... <br /><br />I always felt annoying but everyone needs a confidence boost no matter what.&nbsp; Or for those select few vendors who should be cocky as fuck deserve all the good word for their amazing products and honesty.

				Yes, we appreciate&nbsp; it. Vendors are people too. LOL. <br /><br />Considering that your PM has your username next to it on the inbox page, the key is &gt;titling&lt; your PM with your thoughts of gratitude. <br />This way we know what it entails and who sent it without having to open it. <br /><br />And many vendors remember who thanks them and often reciprocate with a little something extra next go round.

				&nbsp;:)...........We sure do......along with some good detailed feedback.....it softens us up and keeps our head on straight ....because there is always the customer who has an issue......I like to call them the &quot;not happy customers&quot;<br />you could give those customers a brick of pure gold and they would complain that it was not 2 bricks. :-[........<br /><br />So.....yes......you bet. :)

				We love feedback as we try to contact each customer to say thanks when possible. I agree a forum review would be better though as you can see I have been around for a while with great feedback on SR but my feedback thread is crappy due to no one ever coming over to post.

				I&#039;m not a vendor either, but what they say in their replies here make a lot of sense - positive feedback - helpful to the vendor&#039;s rating, helpful to other customers in evaluating the vendor for a possible purchase....&nbsp; &nbsp;and won&#039;t add to probably already overloaded inboxes of busy vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just wanted to say that I thought it very thoughtful on your (OP) part to think to ask the opinion of others before doing something that obviously had good intentions behind it, but you must have had some qualms anyway...&nbsp; &nbsp;always trust that &quot;gut feeling&quot;, &quot;hunch&quot;, &quot;intuition&quot;... whatever you wanna call it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I mean in everything, beyond just your question...&nbsp; &nbsp;all the best to you :)<br />

				As a buyer, I usually just opt to leave feedback in the vendor&#039;s forum review thread. I consider it more helpful to all parties involved. Potential buyers receive the benefit of my purchasing experience, and the excellent vendor receives an appropriately glowing review that is accessible to the public and helps attract customers. Win, Win!<br /><br />However, I was recently so happy with a purchase (and therefore, the vendor) that I sent my first-ever PM to them lettin&#039; &#039;em know just how happy I was with the mechandise, and they rather quickly responded in kind. There are some genuinely nice folks here on SR, and it certainly doesn&#039;t hurt to let a vendor know they&#039;ve made you happy... but I&#039;m sure many vendors have already over-loaded message boxes. Besides, it&#039;s more proper, productive, and beneficial to all involved if you sing their praises in the open forum.<br /><br />If you&#039;d really like to help them, that&#039;s the best way to do it.<br />Hell, do both!
