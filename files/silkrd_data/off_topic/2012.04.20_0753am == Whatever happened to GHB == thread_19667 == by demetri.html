				It&#039;s here on SR - it is just hard to find since you can&#039;t search the listings by 3 letters, and it is buried under Drugs -&gt; Other -&gt; Intoxicants -&gt; GHB.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/161<br /><br />It is certainly not as popular as other drugs.&nbsp; IMHO it is because the dosing is tricky, and people tend to knock themselves out.&nbsp; They are fine, but it freaks out their friends.&nbsp; People in my neck of the woods are pretty divided on it - it is kind of a love / hate thing.<br /><br />

				i had some friends who were really into GBL...I&#039;ve still got about 30ml kicking around my stashbox.&nbsp; I stopped using it though, after one particular incident:&nbsp; I was pouring from a large centrifuge into a small centrifuge for measuring and happened to spill a couple drops onto the Pilates ball i was standing over.&nbsp; well, immediately the rubber started to bubble and degrade and the ball popped.&nbsp; a few drops also fell on the floor and within seconds ate right through the finish on my hardwood.&nbsp; and i thought....&quot;and i&#039;m going to put this stuff in my gut?????&quot;&nbsp; haven&#039;t been able to bring myself to take any more since that day.<br /><br />nice high, though, if you dose accurately.&nbsp; nothing to go crazy for, but a nice high.

				Yeah, tried it a couple of times. For me, it was always a poor man&#039;s MDMA. OK if you couldn&#039;t get hold of the real thing.

				Yes, GBL is a strong solvent. I would never dream of taking it. GHB on the other hand is totally benign. The body even makes it itself. Big difference...<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/6de88ee4ce

				prices for gbl are a little oversized here in the sr...<br /><br />I used to buy it in legit clearnet sites, but from 2 weeks to now it seems that all the sites I knew are without stock. even I made some order right before they all ended without stock, and I haven&#039;t received anything, lost my money and they don&#039;t answer my emails.<br /><br />can someone give some clue about what could be happening? can someone provide some legit site that&#039;s working at the moment?
