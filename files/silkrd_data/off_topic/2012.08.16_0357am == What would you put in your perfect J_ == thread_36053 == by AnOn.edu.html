				So I&#039;m looking through the Road thinking what smokable items I could put together to make the ultimate jay/blunt.&nbsp; Obviously top shelf weed is a basic requirement and at the moment I&#039;m thinking of throwing in some nice hash, a little kief, some high end tobacco to spice up the flavor, and some of Buddha&#039;s Changa.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to also kick in some 2c-b but I understand that smoking it kills most of the effect.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;m wondering what wrapper to use, good papers or should I track down a Romeo et Juliette cubano (we need more cubano&#039;s here) and rip the skin off?<br /><br />So my question to the brilliant minds here is what would you throw in to the mix?

				I&#039;d mix in ketamine (I&#039;d actually prefer to snort it but whatever), black tar heroin, and ur-144. Would taste like doo-doo but the high would be pretty awesome. I someday plan to take all of my favorite drugs at once.

				My jeffrey would contain high grade marijuana soaked in opium then coated with some 100mic fentanyl gel. It would be rolled in a fine cigar and dusted with grade a cocaine before the leaf wraps the L. <br /><br />Then just for good measure it would be dipped in liquid pcp and allowed to dry out. I wouldnt smoke it until my dose of LSD kicked just as i start to peak on my high (1000mg) dose of pure mescaline though.<br /><br />Oh yea i would also take shrooms at some point during the night, lol.&nbsp;

				Mostly Maui Waui man, but it&#039;s got to have some Labrador in it. If I had the cash I&#039;d probably throw a bit of some Great Dane into the mix, it&#039;ll really blow your mind ya know? Get&#039;s you high as fook! ;)

				I would put down a light layer of rolling tobacco across the paper, than in the middle put some grounded up decent grade dank and sprinkle some kief or hash, place a rolled up paper filter at the end. Roll, spark, and puff puff. =)
