				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I am planning to take a plane with 5g MDMA (vacuum sealed, silk road stealth standards...) in my hold baggage. The drug will be in a bottle of shampoo in my toilet bag.<br />Do you think that is risky ?<br /><br />What if there is some MDMA left after my trip and I want to take it back. It wouldn&#039;t be sealed anymore but I would still put it in my shampoo. <br />Do you think that is risky ?<br /><br />Thanks for your advices.

				Is this in the USA? I have flown many times within the US and from the US to other countries and the TSA will rape your luggage. I would not suggest taking it with you, even if you think it would slip by the guards. Just mail it ahead to a good friend of yours and have it waiting for you at your destination would be your best bet in my opinion.

				Dude the best thing to do is to keep on you at all times.......in your pocket if it not too obvious something is there. i took a gram of cocaine with me to spainf rom the EU( i was paranoid anything bigger and they would think im a dealer lol) and it was like in my pocket all the time through customs, they never check your pockets or pat you down and full body scanners are very rare i think.<br /><br />Peace and chill out...it&#039;s easier then expected ;)<br /><br />Saying that though never again because of all the paranoia and anxiety you fell walking through customs.

				You&#039;re not allowed any form of liquid over a certain amount from my experience so it might be taken off you.<br /><br />Empty loads of Solpadeine capsules and fill them with the MDMA and put them loosely in a pocket of your bag with condoms and other tablets like multi vitamins etc. That&#039;s a lot of Solpadeine capsules though but it will work for a few!

				this is very simple know these 3 points -&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Most chances like 95% are that you can get to your destination with the MD with no problem, doesn&#039;t matter were you will hide it, i mean statistically. cause you probably wont get searched if there is not info about you or you will act suspicious.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. if you WILL get searched for drugs at the airport know that&nbsp; there is a VERY high chance that they will find it, doesn&#039;t matter were its hidden, they will empty your shampoo, check your capsules and everything else. they have seen it all.<br /><br />3. just in case you DO get caught keep in mind that importation is a VERY SERIOUS offense in most countries, even with super small amounts and even in countries that are not strict at all regarding possession of the same drug at same amount.<br /><br />so its better to mail it up front or just get locally at destination (you can always order from SR to your hotel)<br /><br />i did it a few time before many years ago (taking some drugs on international flights and borders, in pockets in shampoo etc...)&nbsp; i was never caught but today im sure it was one of the most stupid things i have ever done - the potential risk can be very high comparing to the gain of getting a bit high.

				Don&#039;t put it in the shampoo.&nbsp; Even if you put it in your duffle bag, they look really closesly at liquid containers. If they see that anything is in there they will tear that shit right open.&nbsp;

				You could always just pop it up your bum&nbsp; :D<br />My thing is to squeeze a cigarette filter out, empty out 90% tobacco then cut the filter in half and push half down on top of the tobacco&nbsp; Filter in the powder replace the rest of the filter and just carry it on you and just don&#039;t give a shit.<br /><br />If you are prone to paranoia though it&#039;s just not worth it and don&#039;t smoke the wrong smokes&nbsp; :D

VAGINA!<br />hand luggage liquid rules from the uk are max size 100ml and you can&#039;t have more than 10 containers. i&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s 100% uniform across the eu but very similar. imo it doesn&#039;t matter as much where you put it as to how calm you can act while smuggling. i&#039;ve had the pat down at security and weird questioning at customs many times, just keep cool, act like you&#039;re not doing anything naughty and it&#039;ll be fine.

				I wouldn&#039;t risk it--you should figure out a way to mail it.&nbsp; Even if drug laws are pretty lax where you&#039;re from, transporting them across borders is always a pretty huge offense.&nbsp; All it takes is you getting a random check and you&#039;re screwed--they&#039;ll find it in the shampoo container.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to do it you should read up on what liquids you&#039;re allowed because that&#039;d suck to just watch it get tossed, too.

				So I finally chose to take it on the plane. I hid it a the back of my laptop computer just on the hard disk.<br />I will never do that again, that&#039;s too much stress.

				I just came back from Europe and the only country which had the full body scanner was England / heathrow.<br />Everyone had to go through it.. People in transit only had to go through the metal detector though.<br /><br />In most places in EU it seems they don&#039;t even have customs... like Spain and Italy. I could of pretty much brought anything back in. <br /><br />Also dont put anything in a laptop.. they arent stupid and make you put the laptop through seperatly.. <br />
