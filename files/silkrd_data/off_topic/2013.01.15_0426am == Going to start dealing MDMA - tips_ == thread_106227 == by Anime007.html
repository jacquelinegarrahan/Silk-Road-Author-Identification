				Hey guys, I&#039;m going to start selling MDMA on a small scale and I would love some tips. I live in a decently-sized US city &amp; have good friends who use MDMA occasionally, one that said she would help me sell some of it. I&#039;m choosing to sell MDMA from SR for two reasons, the first being the financial benefit, which I plan to use for music concerts &amp; travel, etc; the second reason is because I would love to spread the love of real, high quality MDMA to friends because a lot of shit that is sold as MDMA is obviously not it. Now, I don&#039;t see myself doing this for a long duration, as the penalties for getting caught are terrible, but I believe that selling small amounts to people I generally know isn&#039;t too bad.<br /><br />I placed my first non-personal sized order of MDMA recently, 10grams. I know this is a tiny order for many dealers or people on SR in general, but here are my questions. What&#039;s the general order size that is less likely to get caught/set a red flag, 10-28g? I&#039;m ordering everything to my residence, so I want to be as careful as possible. I&#039;ve ordered a few personal-sized amounts from the Netherlands a few times and it&#039;s gone flawless. I know international is more of a risk, but the prices are too high domestically to consider it an option. As for selling to people, what are good measure to know who to sell to? I plan to sell to friends &amp; friends of friends and the like, perhaps people I know decently elsewhere. Any other tips would be highly valued, thanks guys.

				Just remember that with SR MDMA selling there&#039;s no real rush to move what you have, so way better safe than sorry. If you get 10 grams and sell it all in one day, you&#039;re up 800-1200$ with no product for the next 3 weeks and you basically have to start over again with your clients or push it to random people, which is risky as shit obviously. So it&#039;s much better to sell to your close friends and people you can trust and sell it slowly than to rush and make a dumb fuck up and end up in jail, you&#039;re gonna be waiting for a few weeks for the next shipment anyways. This means staying away from festivals and the like unless you&#039;re going to move a ton of product there and then stop - if you want consistent, go slowly.<br /><br />Just my 2btc&nbsp; ::) hope it helps

				First I would check the law&#039;s in your state, so you know what your looking at if you were to get caught.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s hardcore in my area, and to me wouldn&#039;t be worth it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Second,&nbsp; don&#039;t trust anybody.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not your gf, not your friends, nobody needs to know that it is coming from you, where your getting it, that type of thing.&nbsp; <br />A sad fact is, no matter how much someone likes you, if they get caught with something that is yours, there is a good chance they are going to exchange your name to get out of trouble.<br /><br />Idk man,&nbsp; If it were me and I was committed to going for it I would make some money and get out of the game asap.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really think that nobody can get away with selling forever, people talk.&nbsp; &nbsp;The key is to be clean and out of business before the house falls down on you.&nbsp; &nbsp; Good luck.

I only plan on selling to friends that I trust/friends of friends thru them. I do not like the idea of selling to someone that I do not have a good connection with as that&#039;s pretty risky. I do not plan to sell at festivals or large events, as that is risky enough. Slow and steady wins the race for sure. Thanks for the advice man :)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=106227.msg728314#msg728314">Quote from: Empathy101 on January 15, 2013, 05:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My random tips which may or may not be useful are....<br /><br />1. Do not text or accept texts.<br /><br />2. Try not to use a phone.<br /><br />3. Watch The Sopranos.<br /><br />4. Go out with someone and have them carry it. You just accept money.<br /><br />5. Watch The Wire.<br /><br />6. Try not to carry a phone on you.<br /><br />7. Do not keep it at your house if possible.<br /><br />8. Use the search function and find all the threads that have already discussed all this stuff.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the advice. I won&#039;t accept texts for sure, calls only. I see how it is wise not to use a phone and not to carry a phone on me, but it&#039;s an important part of keeping in contact with people, for whatever reasons. I just downloaded The Wire as I heard it is an amazing show. As for not keeping it at my place, where are some great places to hide it off premises with still somewhat easy access? <br /><br /><br />Can anyone answer my original few questions? Thanks guys.
