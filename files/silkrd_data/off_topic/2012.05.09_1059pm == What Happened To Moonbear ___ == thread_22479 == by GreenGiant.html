				My hypothesis was that given this information:<br /><br />1. He wanted to kill himself with a gun from the Armory.<br />2. He was storing large quantities of jenkem.<br /><br />It seems like a clear cut case of methane leak + ignition = moonbear explosion.<br /><br />This may also explain many hitherto inexplicable cases of human spontaneous combustion in world history.

				It&#039;s time that I came clean people...Moonbear has been in my basement this whole time living off of his own jenkem and the occasional rat or two. Don&#039;t feel too bad for him though on account of his skin has never been smoother, as I&#039;ve had him apply lotion generously every few hours. ;)
