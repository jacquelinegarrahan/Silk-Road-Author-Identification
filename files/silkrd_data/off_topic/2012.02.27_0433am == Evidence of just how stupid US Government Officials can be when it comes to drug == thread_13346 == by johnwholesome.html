				I love that documentary. Show it to all your friends who are skeptical. Anyone who tells you that ecstasy is more dangerous than alcohol (in other words, 90% of the fucking population) needs to be educated. Educate as many people as you can because it&#039;s really a travesty that millions of college students are dangerously drinking every weekend while a better, safer alternative is placed as a Schedule 1 drug.

It also depletes serotonin, causes hyperthermia, stress to the cardiovascular system, etc. I think it can be used responsibly in moderation for sure and have rolled a decent amount in my life, but I think it is kind of a stretch to say that it is safer than alcohol if both are being used in moderation. Alcohol used in moderation doesn&#039;t cause one out of fifty thousand people to die afaik.

I&#039;ve never heard of this allergy that you speak of, and it seems that the only reason people die is because they&#039;re dumb enough to drink too much alcohol in combination, they overheat in a super crowded dance room, or they drink so much water that their brains swell to the point of death. Alcohol is way, way more dangerous.

Afaik the incidence of &quot;severe&quot; to &quot;life threatening&quot; undesired side-effects are higher by many multiples in the most common otc pain medications, so it&#039;s all relative. Matter of fact, statistically you&#039;re more likely to die from a bee sting than from clean E.<br /><br />As for serotonin. The long term effects are not well understood still. But plenty of new, less biased studies suggest that even the changes that occur due to rapid exposure to high doses may reverse given enough time.<br /><br />&quot;Sabol KE, Lew R, Richards JB, Vosmer GL, Seiden LS (February 1996). &quot;Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced serotonin deficits are followed by partial recovery over a 52-week period.

Ain&#039;t that a kick in the head? You can OD on water! However, you really have to jug down gallons to get there. But then on the other side, rave, hot, sweating out a lot of salts plus paranoid about dehydration jugging down bottles like a madman and then forgetting to piss can get you there...
