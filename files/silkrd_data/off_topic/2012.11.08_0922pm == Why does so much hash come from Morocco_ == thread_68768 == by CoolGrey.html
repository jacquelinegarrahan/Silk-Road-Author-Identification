				I see a lot Moroccan hash on the Road. What makes Morocco such a big exporter? I assume the marijuana is grown there in the open air. Where do they do that? Are there like big plantations in the desert, or are there a lot of farmers making some money on the side?

				The close and far east has had a long history with marijuana production, hashish is an ancient cannabis concentrate that has never gone out of fashion.<br /><br />consider living in an Arabic country; regardless of if you are Muslim; the health conscious individual would shy away from alcohol because the heat of whichever country you are in can cause alcohol to be especially poisonous and harmful.<br /><br />compared to smoking hashish on a hookah; which wont poison your body.<br />its just historical evolution that such eastern religions prohibit alcohol consumption, its not really because god dictates, but because its better for the general population.<br /><br />smoking some 00 now. can you tell? ;D

In Morroco people traditionally used to smoke kief, even today a lot of people only smoke kief, especially the elders.<br /><br />WL
