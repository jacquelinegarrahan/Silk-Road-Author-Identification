				I always thought NJ was just fucking with us anyway...he had to much humor and snap to really be a cp sicko...a bored troll, more likely...kind of liked the fucker...and hey, anybody who had enough snap to use a character from HuckFinn can&#039;t be all fucked up anyway...

				Oh, I guess if you find it one of the uglier words out there, that&#039;s understandable. I always thought the uglier ones were along the lines of &quot;rape&quot;, &quot;misogyny&quot;, &quot;saviour&quot;, &quot;pickle&quot; and &quot;republican&quot;. Those make me shudder more so.&nbsp; ::)

				I thought he used the username &#039;niggerjim&#039; brilliantly.&nbsp; for those of you who *don&#039;t* know, that was Huckleberry Finn&#039;s sidekick, and the guy he floated down the Mississippi river on.&nbsp; It was one of the first and biggest controversies that faced education in this county: One of the best and most famous--and most antiracist-bootks ever published...used the terminology of the day, and many battles were fought, both to get rid of from childhood bookshelves, and to keep it.&nbsp; <br /><br />i thought that was probably why he used it, kind of an &#039;inside&#039; joke or something, as it&#039;s a tough battle: if you haven&#039;t read the book, then I don&#039;t think you can consider yourself &#039;well read&#039; but at the same time...it pushed a lot of buttons...the fact that this character used that specific username I found really interesting....

				11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights advocates, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities. The terms &quot;negro,&quot; &quot;oriental,&quot; &quot;handicapped&quot; or &quot;chick&quot; for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. &quot;Broad&quot; and &quot;chick&quot; were merely the feminine equivalents of &quot;guy,&quot; &quot;dude&quot; or &quot;fellow.&quot; The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights advocates have gone so far as to reject the word &quot;pet&quot; and insist on its replacement by &quot;animal companion.&quot; Leftist anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the word &quot;primitive&quot; by &quot;nonliterate.&quot; They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)<br /><br />12. Those who are most sensitive about &quot;politically incorrect&quot; terminology are not the average black ghetto-dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any &quot;oppressed&quot; group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual, white males from middle-class families.<br /><br /><br />

				Yep. Im a professor. Caught me. Totally. A fat, white, bearded professor. 2 Ex wives and 2.5 children.<br />Now I&#039;m free. Free to reek havoc! IF you know my identity there is no going back!!! I&#039;m going to run through the forest picking up small animals and then throwing them into the sky. Then I&#039;m going to set up a DMT Lab in every mail box I can find! Naked!!<br /><br />But really, trying to push civility and tact into a box by saying it comes from &#039;A privileged&#039; part of society is simply a way of trying to belittle those positive actions, and free yourself from the consequences of not being held to a level of common decency.&nbsp; <br />THe n-word is way different from your far out comparisons. Chick? Pet? Never heard anyone get mad at me for using those. I HAVE seen someone get beat the hell down&nbsp; for being over heard using the n-word. Pretty different. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitialAlch
