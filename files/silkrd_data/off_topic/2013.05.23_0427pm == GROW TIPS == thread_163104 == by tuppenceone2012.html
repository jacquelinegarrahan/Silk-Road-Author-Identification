				how we doing folks, i know a guy... who grows weed lets say this guy is real good at growing his weed as it is, but would like to know if any fellow growers out there have any good tips and tricks they do to boost yields ect<br /><br />person im talking about is currently ruuning:<br /><br />2x2x2 tent<br />6x 50L buckets<br />2x 600w lights<br />bloombastic boost<br />canna pk13:14<br />dutch pro feed<br /><br />tips he already knows...<br /><br />using small weighted objects and string to open plants up to allow more light down into the plants<br /><br />tips he&#039;s heard work<br /><br />cutting out grow heads to allow for a lot larger yield does or doesnt this work?<br /><br />also what tips you guys got :)??? stay high folks 420 ;)<br /><br />

				Tip #1. Buy a larger tent. 2 600w lights in a 2x2x2 tent is wayyyyy too much. If both those lights go into that tent how will the plants grow tall without burning the tops. 3rd the heat generated will kill the plants unless you have cool tubes with extractor fans pulling out heat straight from the light fixture. On top of that you will not be able to get the plants within 12 inches of the light, killing the height of your plants. <br />Tip#2 You can top your plants(cut the tops off) so that 2 new main bud tops will form from 1 plant. If you take that to the next step 1 plant can grow over a pound in doors if you keep topping and topping each new top. <br />Tip #3 You can tie down branches. It is called low stress training. You will open up more bud sites to allow light to penetrate. <br />Tip #4 Look up how to ScrOG ( Screen of green)

				Sounds like he is topping and using LST (low stress training) so I mean outside of keeping the plants really happy and healthy, checking the ph everyday and generally taking care of them 100% then it looks like you guys have already done all you can to get the top yields.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, I&#039;m not sure if he is using LST, if he is just tying weights to bend the branches down to get light to lower areas then he might be inadvertently doing some LST on them.&nbsp; If you pull down certain branches so that they are bent sideways, you expose them to more light thus they will start to grow more and more along their sides increasing your yeild.&nbsp; <br /><br />If It were me, I would probably just remove the lower areas that don&#039;t get light so the plant can focus trichome production on the areas closest to the light but I think your looking for quantity over quality so if that is the case you want as much bud as possible so don&#039;t remove anything.

				If you remove the top make sure that you don&#039;t remove more than you really want to. You need to cut the main stem off just above 2 side branches. So that the side branches form into the 2 main tops. I wouldn&#039;t trust just hanging weights off of them. Because one day if they get larger that weight may actually pull them down. I would just tie strings and drill some holes in the side of the pot or somewhere that you can just put tension on them to the point that they go where you want them. That way once they start putting one weight that tension will be released and wont pull down branches.

				I would never top a plant... that&#039;s it&#039;s big bad boy right there and the bulk of it&#039;s growth potential.&nbsp; You can encourage more &quot;tops&quot; to grow in a similar fashion just by tying down.&nbsp; The highest part of the plant always wants to be &quot;the top.&quot;<br />As the others stated, tying down and supercropping are your friends with this.<br /><br />CO2 additives to the air during veg and when the lights are on during flower help fill in some of your &quot;empty spaces.&quot;&nbsp; You can get tanks at any paintball supply warehouse/shop - and some grow shops even sell automated CO2 realease systems that will give you the proper parts per million... if you give them too much they close their pores and it effects photosynthesis negatively.&nbsp; Also, during flower turn it off for the night cycle, as this is when plants do the opposite, &quot;exhale&quot; CO2 and &quot;inhale&quot; oxygen.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried oxygen supplementation at night cycle - I wonder if it would encourage root growth.<br /><br />Your roots are almost as important as your top, as the underground volume of your plant is almost always equal to the above ground volume.&nbsp; I use organics, a little root stim, and even worms to aerate the soil and chew up and remaining un-composted soil.&nbsp; It makes happy worms and plants.<br /><br />I&#039;m also a huge stickler on using organic soil indoors, so you avoid bugs, have a controlled environment, and I think it tastes better and is more forgiving with mistakes than hydro.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll stop there and let some other folks tell you their stuff.&nbsp; I think I could write a book though.<br /><br />Another tip I can give you is to READ, READ, READ.<br />When I started I read close to twenty books.&nbsp; I read them all cover to cover, the best tips are just little notes hidden within paragraphs that all look the same.&nbsp; Skim repeated info carefully for those tips.&nbsp; I compared techniques and information and gleaned which would be the best to use.&nbsp; My favorite book of them all though has to be this one:<br />(*Warning!

				I agree with the guy above who said read up on scrog (screen of green).<br /><br />Basically it is a similar concept to tying down and LSTing - you&#039;re opening up as much of the plant as possible to light, in this case by using a flat, horizontal net or some sort of grid like structure to allow you to tie all branches down in multiple directions, ensuring each budsite is at equal height and therefore optimal distance from the light source.

				Also if you&#039;re at all unsure about topping, you can practice on all sorts of herb plants. I always top my basil, mint and oregano - it&#039;s especially effective with these types of plants because you&#039;re growing for their leaves not their buds. It&#039;s simple really. You pinch out the growing tip, the plant thinks &#039;what the hell just happened&#039; and in order to carry on growing sends two new growing stems up, one from each side of the topmost node.
