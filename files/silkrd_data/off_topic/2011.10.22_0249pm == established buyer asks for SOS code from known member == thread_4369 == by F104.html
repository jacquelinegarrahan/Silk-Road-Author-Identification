				I&#039;m asking for an SOS referral code from one of the long-term known members here, seller or buyer.<br /><br />Sellers can see my stats at main site when the site is up: member 4+ months, 13, 14, maybe 15 transactions (I can&#039;t recall). I think you can see the feedback I&#039;ve given too.<br /><br />thanks

				I had an SoS account a while back and I lost access to it. I have been looking for another invite for a while. I would LOVE to get back on there. ANyone help us out? (Sorry to thread jack but I am in need also so I thought it better than making an identical thread to compete with yours.) I am a seller with a decent rep if anyone cares. Click the little globe thingie under my avatar to see my seller profile.<br /><br />PS - SoS is safeorscam.com look it up if you don&#039;t know what it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o
