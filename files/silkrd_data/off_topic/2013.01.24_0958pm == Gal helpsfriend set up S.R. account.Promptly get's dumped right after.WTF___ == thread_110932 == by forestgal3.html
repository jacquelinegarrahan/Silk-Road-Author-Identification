				Here&#039;s my tale of woe.lol<br />A friend of friend starts chatting this here gal up on social media.Things are of a flirtatious manner,rapidly escalating to phone calls and plans for a meet up.I&#039;m thinking this is great!I live in the middle of the bush and have been experiencing a real man drought.I&quot;m thinking here&#039;s a man who seem&#039;s nice, is into partying and looks like he might potentially put out! So anyways I start to guide this fellow into&nbsp; a S.r. account.Explaining the in&#039;s and out&#039;s....bitcoins...wallet&#039;s etc.Guy is acting very grateful&quot;thank you so much for doing this for me.I&#039;m gonna send you a gram of H&quot;I&#039;m like okay....that&#039;s nice ...whatever..He repeats this several times..We carry on with our plans for the future and I continue coaching him into receiving his first batch of Bitcoin ready to spend.Finally after a few starts and stops he receives his bitcoin.He makes one more statement&quot;I&#039;m gonna send you a .25 what&#039;s yr address?&quot; Then.........nothing.........no phone calls.....no emails....Dealer tells me nothing was ordered for me...... A little more research&nbsp; and I find he has a girlfriend...........Cocksucker!!!!!! I done got played!!!!!!!!!!!The funny thing is&nbsp; I did&#039;nt set him up cos I thought I would get a reward&nbsp; but damned if I did&#039;nt get my hopes up !!!!!Haha That&#039;ll be the last time for this silly bitch..........you&#039;ll have to find some else to use now for your S.r. info&nbsp; &quot;hausboi&quot;.

				Hooking up off the internet is never a good idea to begin with, ya know?<br /><br />Talking about Sr, and setting up a basic stranger isn&#039;t a good idea either.&nbsp; &nbsp;I kind of think the more private you are the better.&nbsp; Somethings are not meant to be shared, not like that anyway lol.<br /><br />Sorry about it tho,&nbsp; we all do dumb thing&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp; Chin up!!

				Hi Ro,<br />Thanks .This guy was&#039;nt a stranger tho.Same friends,same social scene, same recreational drug scene.I would&#039;nt tell anyone about S.r. unless I did my research first.....instead of researching his drug credentials I should have looked into the female portion....guy was slick I will give him that.Fuck.lol

				forestgal... im a little confused.<br /><br />So essentially you got &quot;played&quot; for a SR account? You didnt actually give him your OWN money to put into his wallet and didnt spend any money on him right?<br /><br />So you got played for your time?<br /><br />SR is definetely not something to share with a total stranger though, lesson learned i guess?<br /><br />GIRLPOWER!

				That sucks, sis.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know this person you speak of.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried recruiting old friends to SR before. They don&#039;t understand the appeal.<br /><br />Sorry about your &quot;loss.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s probably for the best, he sounds like scum.

				Tough break. Id pity his gf if I were you, shes in deep. <br />As for this thread I think it should become an official sub forum &quot;relationship blues and&nbsp;advice&quot; haha. Theres a certain attraction to airing ones woes anonymously to people who wont prejudge. Especially for someone who spends a lot of time with typical stereotypical males.
