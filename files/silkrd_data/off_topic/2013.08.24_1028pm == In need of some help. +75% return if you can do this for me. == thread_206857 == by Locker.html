				Hi everyone,<br />Can I first just say I feel that the spare bitcoins thread is not the best place for such a question, simply because of the spamming of new accounts with little posts trying to get free drugs, so I am sorry If you wanted me to post it in that thread but I feel that it is redundant due to the amount of scammers on there.<br />I really don&#039;t like doing this but I have recently started using a new bitcoin service (VirWoX), who&#039;s fees have screwed me over more than I had anticipated. Even after the fees I was fine for the amount I needed however the rates had changed so I am a little short on a 1.35 btc order. :/<br /><br />It seems to me that there is a large amount of, lets say &#039;scammers&#039;, and people constantly asking for fairly high amounts and I understand that many of them, are slow to be trusted, however; personally I feel that I have been a regular member and contributor to this forum for a decent amount of time, and have also given out several, although small, bitcoin loans in the past to people. (However I fail to remember who they were, as this was several months ago).<br /><br />I hope you understand, that this is something that I don&#039;t enjoy asking, buy I have no options left as VirWoX isn&#039;t an option anymore. I understand this is a fair amount for a loan to an anonymous member of a forum, but I am short of 0.143 bitcoins, purely from VirWoX&#039;s fees. I, as I hope to believe, am a fairly well enough established member of the forum, I hope that someone would be able to do such a thing for me.<br /><br />I am next getting bitcoins around 2btc&#039;s on Friday (depending on the rates) from localbitcoins, and would be happy to give back 0.25 bitcoins for someone who is willing to do such a thing. I hope you can understand that this is not some scam or attempt to get free bitcoins, but I had not intended for the virwox fees to screw me over so badly. :/<br /><br />Thank you to anyone who can help, my silkroad name is &#039;lockerp&#039;, and as I said If things go to plan I am able to repay you .25btc on Friday.<br />I know that I have wrote a lot for just this but I thought if i was going to ask for such a thing I would make the effort to explain myself, and I hope you can trust and help me out with this one.<br />Locker.

				Anyone? <br />I understand it&#039;s hard to be trusted, but I can guarantee a +75% return of .25btc if you can do this for me. As it is a sunday, it would be best if I could place my order today, so if anybody could help they would help me out a lot.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Locker.

(Which is due to VirWoX), or that you are unable to trust me? I have already said that I would be able to give .25btc on Friday when I next get my bitcoins for my big order of LSD, Ketamine and Weed, and would have at least .5btc for paying back this loan. (even though I would repay before spending any of it).<br /><br />Locker.

				Hey man,<br />If I were you I would stop using virwox, its a complete rip off. <br />Start using https://localbitcoins.com/<br />You can buy bitcoins there online, no need to meet anyone. You can use bank transfers and other methods of payment. The price/BTC is also good.

On friday when I get some money I will be trying out LocalBitcoins to try again. <br /><br />Like i said, If anyone would be able to help me I would be able to give you .25btc, I really don&#039;t want to wait till friday (or likely later because of the weekend), to order. :/<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Locker.
