				I like lists. Here are my favorite drugs, in order.<br /><br />Zoloft + Abilify - without this, I&#039;d probably have killed myself by now.<br />MXE - my new favorite. I love this shit. <br />Magic Mushrooms - wish they were more visual for me, but mostly it just makes me go sort of insane and get stoned. Need more experience with it.<br />DXM - I had a very enlightening experience on DXM in which I resolved (successfully) to do better in school and forget my old friends. I didn&#039;t find it particularly fun though, just sort of weird and odd. Also makes music sound tinny and distant to me.<br />Pot - it&#039;s good to get a buzz, especially with some alcohol and just chill out. On the other hand, I&#039;m not a huge fan of it like some other people are, I feel like I&#039;m turning my mind off too much.<br />Booze - it&#039;s legal and it lets me enjoy time with my friends and get past my social anxiety. However, I drink too much and am probably fucking up my liver and if I could use other drugs out in public I&#039;d quit booze entirely for probably my benefit.<br />2c-b - not a very interesting or enlightening high. I also don&#039;t like that it makes magic mushrooms not work for like a week after using it. However, the feeling of being on 2c-b, being shitfaced and stoned off your ass is a very interesting high.<br />Opiates - would be up there with booze and pot if it weren&#039;t, you know, addictive as fuck. I don&#039;t feel good with opiates, but I don&#039;t really get &quot;high&quot; per se. Not interesting, not enlightening, not a very good contribution to my life.<br />MDMA - I actually had a bad MDMA trip when I took it. I think my pill was too strong.<br />PCP - I reluctantly put this on the bottom of my list because when a PCP trip is good, it&#039;s really good and some of my most memorable and productive drug experiences have been on PCP. However, when it&#039;s bad it&#039;s really bad and I&#039;ve heard too many stories of really unpredictable PCP behavior that has made me swear off it. It&#039;s actually the only drug I&#039;ve sworn off of besides tobacco. Speaking of which...<br />Tobacco - I nearly killed myself with this shit. So much wasted money for nothing, so much difficultly just making it through movies because I needed a cigarette. So many years wasted not working out or being physically active and therefor probably being depressed because of lack of physical exercise, which probably led me to being a bit fat which probably made me not get laid. Fucking cigarettes.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions on what drug I should try next? I&#039;ve already ordered some Ketamine and 3-MeO-PCP. I&#039;m also interested in LSD as I&#039;d like a very visual experience, but have yet to have one with any of the drugs I&#039;ve taken.

				MDMA<br />Bing <br />MDA<br />Ketamine<br />Mephedrone <br /><br />All mixed into one solid line of death. LET&#039;S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!<br /><br />And then Valium for when you need to sleep and Viagra if you pull when you are on the above. <br /><br />By the way on a serious note, I recommend EVERYONE try good quality Bing and good quality Mephedrone mixed into one line. It is SHIT HOT.

				If by &#039;favourite&#039; is taken into consideration not only the drug&#039;s immediate subjective effects, but also its long-term physical and psychological effects, my vote would be LSD, which is extremely rewarding psychologically, but also produces no deleterious physiological effects, even at relatively high doses.<br /><br />My next favourite, of the limited number of drugs I have tried, would be MDMA and amphetamine.

				In order from least favorite to most favorite, although they&#039;re all plenty of fun:<br /><br />4) Marijuana - Pretty basic stuff right here. I do enjoy getting high occasionally, but once I found what I think are the better drugs, I stopped smoking as much because the others are just top of the line. But so many of my friends smoke and do nothing else, so it&#039;s easy to smoke on a regular basis.<br /><br />3) Mushrooms - This and #2 are pretty much interchangeable. I guess there is a difference, but I can&#039;t really figure out what it is. I really just love tripping. I have great conversations, great thoughts, and when I go outside nature is just so beautiful.<br /><br />2) LSD - Same as #3 basically. I guess I give LSD the advantage because it&#039;s easier to take, and also it lasts much longer which I love.<br /><br />1) MDMA - 250 mg of Ivory&#039;s MDMA is my favorite all time dose of anything. I feel amazing, I love everyone, and generally good times are had by all. It&#039;s not even close. MDMA is my favorite drug.

				1. 4-aco-dmt - a lot like shrooms but no nausea, or body load. I love this drug. Everything else pales in comparison. <br />2. weed/hash - good old. goes well with everything. used to toke daily, now cut down to weekends/chill times with friends. <br />3. mdma - would rate it higher, but it feels harmful if taken too often. still, once a month i hug everyone.<br /><br />there are more I like, but these three are top.

				1. Marijuana-most consistent and reliable. plus I use it multiple times daily<br />2. Mdma- love electric music and nothing makes a show like molly<br />3. lsd- only had good stuff a couple times but some of the most memorable times<br />4. coke- I get horribly addicted the night I am consuming it but I always have a lot of amazingly introspective thoughts and conversations<br />5. ketamine- only did one line once, WAY to much btw. Was fucking amazing even though I accidentaly partially cut my hand off since no one told me to not stand up while in a hole lol.<br />6. 2c&#039;s and shrooms because they just don&#039;t always provide a good OR bad trip, can go either way and just get boring sometimes.
