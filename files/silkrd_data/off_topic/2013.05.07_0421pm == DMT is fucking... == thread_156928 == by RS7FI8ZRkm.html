				DMT is amazing for a while sure, but wait till you properly breakthrough and I don&#039;t mean going in to hyperspace and seeing crazy colours and patterns I mean completely disconnecting from the matrix becoming Shiva and then coming back to the illusion.&nbsp; DMT is great at first but you can go too far with it trust me, I&#039;ve seen it happen many times including to myself.

				DMT is amazing, but remember to use it as a tool for growth of yourself. It is even better when you meditate before hand and put yourself into an open mentality of receiving universal truth within you. I know this sounds out there; I am not a very spiritual person, but this has shown me a side of life I&#039;ve never seen.<br /><br /><br />Reggeatheage, what do you mean by:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156928.msg1105080#msg1105080">Quote from: reggatheage on May 08, 2013, 02:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> DMT is great at first but you can go too far with it trust me, I&#039;ve seen it happen many times including to myself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Meaning feeling overwhelmed by the trip, or something else?<br /><br />Good vibes all,<br />46

				I&#039;ve heard using a meth-style pipe is the way to go. <br /><br />I normally use one of those &quot;smokeless&quot; metal pipes, the one where you can screw a little metal lid on the top of the bowl that has a little hole for the flame?<br /><br />I usually try to smoke ~75-100mg in a bowl, its more than I need as i almost always have a little left over in the bowl, but its a good way for me to ensure I blast off. I don&#039;t like not breaking through. Smoking DMT and still being present in this realm is a weird feeling, i can almost &#039;feel&#039; the weakness of this reality, but can&#039;t break through it. It&#039;s not an uncomfortable or unpleasant feeling, just annoying because I know I can take it farther. I&#039;ve been told smoking DMT but not breaking through at psychedelic concerts is fun. <br />Might try it at Shpongle this Summer.<br /><br />DMT is amazing though. The only other time I&#039;ve gotten similar experiences was meditating on 300ug of LSD when I was like 17, and even then it wasn&#039;t as wildly out of body as DMT is<br /><br /><br />The first time I smoked DMT me an my girlfriend smoked it on the roof of her house as the sun went down, put on some Grateful Dead and sparked the bowl. Jerry&#039;s voice would get distorted, and slow down as prismic patterns engulfed everything. &quot;St.Stephen wiiiittthhhhhhhh a rooooooosssssseeeeeeeee in and out of the gardddddeeeeennn he gooooeesssss&quot; the music and lyrics were tripping me out and then <br /><br />BAM<br /><br />I was gone, there was nothing, what i could only try to explain as the simplest form of &#039;me&#039; was buzzing around as a ball of white heat, and all around &#039;me&#039; (if i could even say regard myself as &#039;me&#039; by that point) were these walls of electric neon fractals that were buzzing and melting and contiually changing. They glowed extremely vibrant neon colors of red, orange, yellow and pink. There was no noise, only a weird ringing and buzzing that i vaguely remember.<br />That whole out of body experience, while feeling like lifetimes, lasted probably like 5 minutes tops. <br /><br /><br />I fucking love DMT. But even THINKING about doing causes me to start getting shaky an anxious, like my sub-conscious is getting worried that it&#039;ll get blasted to nothingness again. <br />So i only do it like every 3-6 months, and i&#039;ll do it two, three times in a week and not touch it for another few months. <br /><br />A gram will last me like a fucking year or more.

The DMT had melted, but then when it cooled solidified back into waxy chunks. It turned a little darker red and became more chunky. My friend said if anything it&#039;ll be slightly more potent. I smoked some and its still awesome. <br /><br />I keep my DMT in a stash can somewhere where its room temp. all the time, and I&#039;ve got some of those silica gel bags that come with shoes an shit, to keep moisture an shit out.

I have yet to experience it myself<br /><br />Tried vaporizing it once, but it was too painful to inhale<br /><br />I guess we didn&#039;t do it the proper way ;D<br /><br />Maybe taking it orally through MAOI inhibitors is a better option,<br />if I am correct this is how they used it in the amazon.<br />I need to do more research on that matter;)

				Thanks for the link - I&#039;ve just placed an order from a domestic vendor for 50mg of DMT pre-loaded in a free &#039;machine&#039;.<br /><br />Not sure on dosing, but does 50mg sound like a reasonable dose for a first time user? The bonus is I&#039;ll now have the &#039;machine&#039; to re-use if I order more in the future :)

				ive blasted off about 50 times in the past 4 years, its awesome.&nbsp; ive got another packge coming today, but its the first time ive ever bought it. one of my relatives was making huge batches of it for college parties, and turned me onto a huge pile several years ago. took about 3 months, of 40s to do it all up. but it started out as magical candyland, then eventually became&nbsp; land of the reptoids. so i just never hooked up again. now im hopin the reps are gone and i can trip in peace.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Read up a lot on administration.&nbsp; Efficient administration is key to getting the most out of your DMT and not pyrolyzing or burning it.&nbsp; Check out dmt-nexus, as someone else stated before me.&nbsp; A lot of people are saying they use 60-100 MGs.&nbsp; That tells me automatically that they&#039;re wasting a lot of the product.&nbsp; That much shouldn&#039;t be necessary, unless that person has a natural tolerance to DMT.

				I had a question Japan but I think you just answered it when you said it was the strongest psychedelic experience. Exactly how much did you use? Also how much would you recommend for someone who just want&#039;s to experience a mild psychedelic experience on DMT opposed to the strongest experience ever?<br /><br />I&#039;m getting some in a few days but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m going to be doing it any time soon I just wanted obtain some just in case and so it&#039;ll be here when that time comes.

				Sensei -<br /><br />That&#039;s a real hard question to answer because it all comes down to whether you get the right technique when vaporizing it. If you&#039;re experienced or have researched a lot and you are certain you&#039;ll get it right then for a mild/medium psychedelic I would say about 15-20mg. But if you want to breakthrough then you&#039;re probably looking at about &gt;30mg. <br /><br />I used the Machine and found it very easy to use once the DMT had been melted on to the thick brillo that is placed in the neck of the bottle.<br /><br />But Like I said this was my first ever experience with DMT - and to be honest someone called BlakIris form the thread I started (see link below) gave me some very useful information on exactly getting it right - and that I certainly did!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158915.msg1125955#msg1125955

DMT can be sored well in an inert setting.<br />Even if you do leave it out, it only degrades into DMT N-oxide, which is still psychoactive, and can be made back into DMT.<br /><br />Your best bet for storage would be to take your DMT freebase and react it with fumaric acid to make DMT fumurate. Vaccum seal this, and put it in a mason jar that can be sealed. Mix some baking soda and vinegar in another jar, wait for the reaction to finish, and &quot;pour&quot; off the co2 into the mason jar (To remove oxygen and create an inert atmosphere)<br />Then all you have to do is seal your mason jar and pop it in the freezer. I&#039;ve kep quantities of DMT like this for years, and they still work.<br /><br />You can convert your DMT fumurate back to a freebase and vaporize it, or you can smoke it as a salt. The benefits of a salt is that if it&#039;s pure enough, it can be injected, or shorted, or plugged, if you&#039;re into that.<br /><br />It can also be mixed with Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then applied to the skin as a topical cream. It will be like injecting it, with dosage being similar.<br /><br />Best of luck in your DMT travels!<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br />The Andromeda Group

If you keep it stored well it will NOT degrade into other chemicals; I&#039;ve personally stored it for as long as 1 year with no difference whatsoever in the trip quality. It is not either as difficult to store as many people think (i.e. in a freezer as some do, or turn it into fumarate or dissolving it into a solvent etc.). Just keep it in a dark and cool place sealed in a non-metal or not-plastic container (glass is perfect) and you are good to go. Probably the most important things are that light and air should not come in contact with it (elsewhere yes, it degrades).
