How much would that place suck living at? And how much more would it suck to be an amphet SR vendor over there???

You are aware that North Koreans aren&#039;t allowed an internet connection, right? Being caught using it results in being sent to a prison camp indefinitely where you&#039;ll probably die in a few years. You&#039;re not even allowed to watch TV channels other than the one broadcast by DPRK itself. They have people going around making sure there aren&#039;t any TVs that have been tampered with to receive South Korean television. Violators are executed if they&#039;re lucky.

				North Korea doesn&#039;t really have internet, and I highly doubt any country is going to let a package sent from North Korea into their borders without being opened, scanned for radiation, etc.<br /><br />There are no North Korean SR vendors lol.

They do it because they&#039;re literally starving to death. All North Koreans are prisoners. They are forced into work camps and if they try to leave the country the gov&#039;t not only kills them, but they kill the rest of their family as well.
