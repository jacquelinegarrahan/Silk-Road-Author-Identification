				What are you guys thoughts on Marc Emery?&nbsp; &nbsp;He is still in Prison for selling seeds, right?&nbsp; I remember when Cannabis Culture had a full 10-12 pages devoted to his seed sales at the front of every magazine.&nbsp; I used to love reading all the different descriptions of the different types of seeds he had for sale when I was a weed n00b.&nbsp;

				Him so maybe karma bit him in the ass, and he&#039;s really in jail for child molestation. Nasty fucker, but I do appreciate what he&#039;s done for cannabis culture. Although there are many other seed vendors on clearnet and such. Too bad his own country gave him to the FEDS =[.

Great man when it comes to marijuana. Didn&#039;t know that he did any weird shit like that. I did see him on a documentary when he went up to a younger group and was smoking and talking to them for ever. Didn&#039;t look like they wanted him there after a while lol

				Well only heard about the good stuff he has done for cannabis so i have to say i like him. What i don&#039;t like is how his own government extradited him to the Us that is something that is unheard of most countries never extradite their own citizens to a other country so there was something fishy going on between Us and Canada<br />
