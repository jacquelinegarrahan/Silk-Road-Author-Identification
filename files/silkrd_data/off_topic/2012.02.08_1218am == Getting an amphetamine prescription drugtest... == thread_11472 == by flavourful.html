				So, today I went to the psychiatrist and was given a script for some amphetamine, however I have been taking adderall/vyvanse for the past month or so.<br />After being given a script for 1 month supply I was asked to take a drug test...<br />Will they take away my prescription if they notice I have been on adderall recently without a prescription?<br />also can anything else happen other than losing my script?

				Will they take away my prescription if they notice I have been on adderall recently without a prescription?<br /><br />&nbsp; -Depends on what kind of communication/relationship took place prior to being prescribed &amp; tested. Are you sure it was a drug test and not a thyroid test (this is usually standard with prescribing stimulants)?<br /><br />- If you test positive, then yes, you may, and likely will get cut off. Amphetamine can show up on a urinalysis anywhere from 1-5 days after the last dose. Your result depends on how frequently you have been using it, as well as how much time passed between your last dose and the piss test. If you weren&#039;t taking tons of it and didn&#039;t take any for 3-5 days before being tested, then you may have passed it. There are guidelines for what qualifies as a positive drug test. If a test does not give results higher than the guidelines, it does not qualify as a &quot;positive&quot; test.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />also can anything else happen other than losing my script?<br /><br />&nbsp; -Not sure what you had in mind, but probably not. It&#039;s won&#039;t be that big a deal for you. The worst I can think of is that it would go in your chart/medical record and they refuse to renew your prescription. If you do fail but have already established trust w/ him/her, might want to consider being frank/honest about your use and why when the subject comes up, it may go a long way. Good luck.

				was this a big hospital psychiatrist? because I go to a private practice type deal and they don&#039;t do pee tests and there aren&#039;t nurses walking around with buckets of pee. If your area is infested with crackheads, most of them will have probably tried to hit up the same psychiatrist with amps. By now, your psychiatrist will have hate towards all crackheads and will punish you with Wellbutrin or Strattera. <br /><br />From my reading, I&#039;ve concluded that you will most likely be thrown into the &quot;drug seeking&quot; pile. If you go back for round 2 - they&#039;ll still help you with drug therapy but anything that is a controlled substance will be off limits. <br /><br />Being blacklisted isn&#039;t the end of the world though. You could always wait a few months and then start over with another mental health facility. A realistic story to tell the new doc would be: <br /><br />&quot;Hey doc, awhile ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I had a prescription for a month but I realized that I couldn&#039;t afford the cost of visits/drugs. I am now financially stable again (or I am now on a different insurance plan/I am no longer prostituting myself/I called 1800-ASK-GARY/I found a million dollars on the street. Any of these will work) and would like to resume the amphetamine drug treatments&quot; <br /><br />Wear nice clothes. Don&#039;t be on drugs. Do not be over joyous or perk up if the doc mentions any of the fun drugs on your list. Most importantly, smile =) Psychiatrists deal with patients that are grumpy, depressed, elmo, or crazy all day long. When you walk in there all happy and shit - you will be the first smile he&#039;s seen from a patient in awhile - and will be happy to shower you with controlled II substances. <br /><br />
