				First off, i&#039;m not new here, I just created a new account for this venture. If I purchase a sellers account and list these in escrow, would anybody be interested in lsd gummy stars? They&#039;re verrrry strong and come in a variety of flavors, they taste pretty good too lol. I have access to quite a few of these so I&#039;ll mainly do bulk orders, but i&#039;d love to send out samples to a few trusted members to build my rep first :). I&#039;m not sure if I really wanna do this or not but if somebody can teach me how to cover every bit of security I need and how to properly mail stuff like this I think I may...<br /><br />If somebody can teach me how to clean a picture up so there&#039;s no way it can be traced, I can put some up of these.<br />Thanks!<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />My pgp key<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBE7O5aoBCAC4tfLjlae688/LGssdHFfDQWbWwLkpYUt11ya2zzhJiUw7KR+D<br />z67ud8Rk+hL0NsZPjk8X7jASw/522WWD6MJD4RJcUgSrrJJ6SeWnm0UHeUeTx0d3<br />Aj4sSsXMZ92O0E4v1HMmnPtgtu00r3zJ29iZS+QTi6UBKZcmB8sl1pW5tarvbotp<br />xmGljkVsvQR1B4sy58W7Db26CzO8BHgw/Qf9iCvoapnrymT9xdemJ2XoNDVeUECG<br />HXx/JrHzbIhpKFuu6b9cEmjuA3bNftXLpHsGCXJOytCXtHscCkrOqA8WcvCVuTlm<br />vGKAlU3cJq8Mmh2pxeT12/UVXcQ5SmSiH+wHABEBAAG0I0JpbGwgTmlsbCA8Z3Vt<br />bXlzdGFyc0BodXNobWFpbC5jb20+iQE4BBMBAgAiBQJOzuWqAhsDBgsJCAcDAgYV<br />CAIJCgsEFgIDAQIeAQIXgAAKCRCsdFZgOH50Wv4qCACajuXMUtgTqVQ0QHHfYwF0<br />zjs0dXWEBToFKyqMPAdP+LCrSCIMsInzcqvsywPraq+0phJNqevcRCH7d8Q11baw<br />OA6ppRRLNhS9Pxg1b+4EQadLCZ7DKI5R6o5n1UuR/g5+qYmLJwtA58OrFwDYErnW<br />ru0UreAuCLps0YQ+RafNU3cJIbq1Ovhqbis/XDlXmVpdfUPknM8j917+ctGA1Oee<br />mhJHb4EQFQqWUpHwvJuLyVhjllsxooCMrwg7aymrjUJUSeNWWCQmg69x4glUEvsK<br />bpVoK2O/BSfTMXjzyQs+Rh9ytnCo8YXm9ae46b2QU63dN96pyxCWsZPi6MQ/2Ohi<br />uQENBE7O5aoBCADhrN+qHZka6NqcvZy90WIzv5R/I1OHBTDOltcjaXxL6trVvm2p<br />1HOhxM1dhGSkSFhxTXS0aI+rdcEppz0mqdxTZzVKp9ubd9mm+kcEQ3NcTPB313Xz<br />UT9Fckoofn+00KNrTu1PWdTzX/PCWDPm6EFwM7LTxWITWNB52vPwzzMe8kgZzGyL<br />YfxGd3AMXscuR6/DFu+WGIDJooDFEYVqvCK3olBs3sHetBYSHqURRbK7EmipA/6z<br />IpFeoYLznt7+d9kTQh6atCBVn5hGHMpbQVND5/LT5JcMB2iny/NI358iGHLa4Cna<br />oahfWs2th+SRCVTtbxOqnACqZNb4TiybVr73ABEBAAGJAR8EGAECAAkFAk7O5aoC<br />GwwACgkQrHRWYDh+dFq24gf/Wo0F/hOjnRiE10FlxNfb33eTNTDAcPj4t6XuEocZ<br />MbGTToFhOVCJd6ZSnrhqbGueHkGHoJ9q6YgUtS4UTiBQBD0cX3cjTCJ13k55tJHo<br />8J0vshXzwUJQaCjErNpfk2NNqrXAQUGc644vNhW4uZ4/ChLCsozzt5yPmCtErk8L<br />Rm2lES+2Q8bdDzgvcu8Qtbd3G+aoQ+a1sK8LyfNi4jhvec8mPLWNRYvgqVqiZWLA<br />MEJUGsilHEgVivB0GWWb0UlJV6WmNFZOUY5/05WDEyjIV427Yz6XH6iCQwvBFpGc<br />lWvTgvUgZxCbgR+jnmPW28lqnvFj0UeoTaFdEAbIuxJ6dQ==<br />=z5x1<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

				Haha, something as simple as &#039;I&#039;m in North America shipping worldwide&#039; would suffice.&nbsp; The reason I ask is because depending on where you&#039;re located packaging and the way you&#039;re going to operate will change.<br /><br />Being skeptical is a good thing in this game, but you don&#039;t have to worry too much about giving some vague location details.

				As of now it&#039;s lookin like<br />25 Stars - $175<br />50 Stars - $325<br />100 Stars - $575<br />200 Stars - $900<br /><br />Prices will most likely be a little cheaper than this, I&#039;d just rather price them higher, then let you all know they&#039;re cheaper than to price them low and find out I told you all too little and have to raise it. :(<br /><br />Im gunna offer 5 star samples to 4 high ranking members on here with over 150 posts to establish a rep, and once again I WILL NEVER ASK TO FINALIZE EARLY OR PURCHASE OUT OF ESCROW.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t receive your package the first time and I see it was intercepted (even though i&#039;m 100% positive this will never happen as these look like ordinary gummy candies), I will reship free of charge. If it miraculously does not arrive again I will issue a 100% refund for established buyers. No questions asked.

				Have everyone who&#039;s sampling send you their address encrypted with your PGP in a PM.&nbsp; Send the samples in a plain white envelope with printed address labels.&nbsp; You want your envelopes to blend in with the business mail that USPS is sorting on a daily basis.<br /><br />Since you&#039;re sending LSD I really can&#039;t imagine you having any problems.&nbsp; Try to keep you packages simple and you should be golden.

				Well naturally everyone is going to be skeptical at first... I sure as hell am, but i kinda figure that we cant throw out the baby with the bathwater.. We cant write new people off because there are shiesty bastards out there. We HAVE to give new vendors a chance or else who will?!? Dont get me wrong, I&#039;m not sayin go out and buy 200 right of the rip (especially dont finalize an order that big early without hella feedback). But, there is a need for people who are willing to take the risk of losing some cash for the greater good of silkroad. Me personally, I&#039;m not stressing loosing 50 bucks if it turns out that Gummystars is being dishonest. Although I&#039;m by no means saying he/shes done anything to be looked at suspiciously. GS has been nothing but great to me so far. =D<br /><br />The Future of silkroad looks BRIGHT and its full of GUMMYSTARS!!!

This was the post I was referencing. You say that they&#039;ll last three days, and that when kept in the fridge they&#039;ve lasted over a month. So I just wanted to clarify, for my own sake and also I&#039;m sure there are others who have noticed so it would be good for you and all involved to get clarification. So each individual star is 140-160 ug right? So if I got 10, even if I did it once a week I would still need it to be able to last almost three months without degrading. I plan on keeping it in a container, and probably also wrapped in tin foil or something, in the fridge. I know acid generally lasts a fair amount of time if taken care of, but this is also somewhat of an unusual form(gummies) and with this post I just wanted to make sure. I&#039;ll message you as well, and I already did and you said they would last, but thought I&#039;d make a public post so that it can be addressed publicly on the forum.

				I have faith in you Gummystars, I have been watching this post for a while and just been waiting to see whats gonna come! I feel like you are reliable, lets hope I am right. You will have a lot of love and money comin&#039; your way if you prove all these skeptics wrongs, as for if you are a scam (not saying you are) You made yourself a little bit of cash and will be hated lol my hopes is for the first one :)

				Maybe scamming wouldn&#039;t be such a big problem here if people didn&#039;t make it so easy.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe how many people have released early to this dude, who has not had a single order delivered yet.&nbsp; Scamming is just going to keep being a problem if people are so eager to give their money away.&nbsp; Even if you can afford to lose 50 bucks or whatever, you are contributing to the larger problem.<br /><br />I hope to eat my words, but I&#039;m not expecting to.

				Maybe its just the psychonaut in me, but I tend to think the best of people. That said Im newish here so take this for what you will.<br />Firstoff, GummyStars doesnt seem to be acting in the same manner that other scammers on this site have (reading past forum discussions).<br />He&#039;s been very responsive to PMs and on the boards. Not just once his sale went up either - he spent basically a week on here prior to sales speaking with experienced sellers to figure out the correct procedures to use. <br />He hasnt asked anyone to finalize early, just offered it for a little quid pro quo. I think wanting to keep your stash re-upped is a pretty normal thing, and beside the possibility of a scam, this is a pretty damn smart initial business strategy - as can be seen by the drought in the sales of some reputable sellers.<br />As someone said earlier, it would be high time for him to have bounced already if scamming. I would imagine that by this point anyone on the fence is probably staying there until some of these samples arrive, so he really wouldnt have much to gain by sticking around on the boards and calmly urging patience - as he has done. <br />He isn&#039;t shipping outside the U.S. In my mind if you were simply here for a week or whatever to scam people why would you limit your profits by not accepting orders? especially since international orders would take even longer for shipping to arrive, thus elongating the scamming window of opportunity. Same concept applies in reverse, if he was scamming, why not say he was in Germany or something so that the amount of time before he was found out would be almost doubled.<br />When you take all this stuff together, it just doesnt form a legitimate pattern of activity that I think someone interested in simply robbing money from others would follow. <br /><br />Basically, Im a little nervous, as like I said, Im kindof new to this, but if GummyStars is a scammer he is the fucking Professor Moriarty of SilkRoad and I&#039;ve just been taken to school.<br /><br />But like I said, this is basically my first time in this rodeo, so take all this with a grain of salt. <br /><br />Cheers! everybody, and I hope in a week we will all be reflecting on how awesome those gummy stars turned out to be!

				I haven&#039;t placed an order with GS but I&#039;ve been watching this thread in hope that it all works out.&nbsp; The only thing I am skeptical about is the fact that he offers 10 extra stars if released early... on top of really cheap prices...&nbsp; how would he benefit from throwing in 10 extra hits for someone who is only paying for 5?&nbsp; I can tell you that is a definite lose in profit.&nbsp; 10 is a high number to throw in for free in my opinion, I would have less suspicion if it was one or 2...&nbsp; However, I&#039;m extremely cautious after being scammed twice and then getting fake cid from Unammedgrower...

				Let me get this right. His first send outs were on Nov 30th. 30th doesn&#039;t count as a business day.

				I wanted to stay out of this and just lurk around the thread but...<br /><br />I caught GummyStar&#039;s offer about 2 days before the bonus was going to expire. I sent a message letting him know I was interested and asked when the offer officially expired. So to try to get it in in time I hurried out to Walmart to get a MP. A little bit later I have the BTC.<br /><br />Oh no, I didn&#039;t realize there was a postage fee! :( So now I&#039;m about 1 BTC short and I can&#039;t check out. I message GummyStars and he says he&#039;ll send me 1 BTC that I can pay him back on. So I go to sleep and wake up the next day. Even worse yet the BTC exchange rate dropped just enough that I&#039;m still about 1 BTC short! Not wanting to cause GummyStars any more trouble I send a message saying that I&#039;ll just forward what I have available to his SR account (just like he did for me with the 1 BTC). Well the system didn&#039;t let all my BTC through so I did it in a 16 BTC and 0.37 BTC transfer. http://oi42.tinypic.com/16baasw.jpg<br /><br />Now, the next day (today) I see like 2 new pages in this thread of people freaking out. For whatever reason it starts to get to me - I&#039;ve had my concerns but it just seems like -everyone- is worried now. So I send a message to GummyStars letting him know I would rather just get 5 gummies through the regular escrow method and forgo the 5 gummy bonus he offered me and have him reverse the BTC I sent him (and that I would vouch that he did such in this thread since that would be very unscammmer-like to reverse payment). I&#039;m very worried now because he messaged me back asking if I had sent him money and that he doesn&#039;t know what my last messages meant with regards to me sending him money straight to his account. I have to state that in my transaction log it never showed up receiving 1 BTC from GummyStars so maybe SR doesn&#039;t list received payments (can someone confirm or deny this for me?) and he could legitimately be in the dark. His SR account balance should still register about $50 more though.<br /><br />So basically I forwarded GummyStars some money and he is claiming not to have any (current) knowledge of it. I&#039;m not trying to rip into him or make him look bad. I&#039;m simply giving the story as it has unfolded so far.

				The skepticism stems from consistent scamming in the LSD market; I&#039;m not sure how long you have been around here, but it&#039;s really been disgusting. If you keep it together and your product is legit and at good prices, you&#039;ll be successful.

				I&#039;ve been watching this thread for a few days now.. it&#039;s a damn roller coaster ride.<br /><br /><br />If you think this person is a scammer then ignore the temptation. Gummy-Stars sure as hell acts very professional which led me take a gamble and order some product.. but I will not finalize until I receive my product. <br /><br /><br />Will tomorrow answer all of our questions? I will surely be here to find out. Do a favor for all of us and stop with the accusations. No one here can make up their damn mind except for Gummy-Stars standing up for himself.

				My 2 cents. <br />From what I know about the mail system right now and from the experience of having a lot of orders pile up, I&#039;m feeling GUMMYSTARS pain, he seems legit to me. I don&#039;t know why, but if he does come off being what everyone is scared of.. he would be the first person in my life that has ever bluffed me so good... because I can read people. I would give this until Tuesday guys/gals. Mail system is indeed backed up right now, but I do know it&#039;s not going to be as backed up as a Tuesday delivery. The guy did remove the 10 star special for finalization, he wants you to use escrow... doesn&#039;t sound like a scammer to me. I would like to hear from one of the internationals that were turned down for sale, or if any internationals were given the option to pay... because he states he didn&#039;t accept payments from international. Which makes sense, if you read page 1/2, he is not familiair with the mail system.. and like when I started, it was only domestic.. until recently... he just doesn&#039;t come off to me as a bad guy. <br />Just my 2 cents.

Appreciate the offer though. I just personally know what your going through. This is awful to have to go through being new, but in a place full of drug dealers, you can only imagine we ain&#039;t the best of people.. were not doctors and lawyers.. so along with drug dealers you will find the lower life scammers.. and it&#039;s just to bad theres a whole lot and people are just worried. Try not to take offense. If you know you did right, just lay back and let your actions speak for you. If you mailed, they will show up. Your already semi known very well already due to this, so take it as a blessing. Your sales should go through the roof once this all blows over. There&#039;s a lot of money to be made on SR, instead of scamming do the right thing people. Provide a service, it feels better then scamming and karma is a bitch. Gotta watch out for her.

				It doesn&#039;t say much for the SR vendor rating system when Gummystars has a 100 rating and NOT ONE PERSON has recieved any product.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you see a problem with finalizing early people???&nbsp; Yes his score can plummet as soon as people start changing their rating but in the meantime you have a brand new vendor with a 100 rating that makes other buyers assume he is legit.&nbsp; &nbsp; Why did over 25 people finalize early???&nbsp; &nbsp;STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES I guess.<br />Sorry Gummy....I hope you make me eat my words but I&#039;m pretty sure I know where this is going.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nomad would call this Eager Beaver syndrome I believe.

				Well i have been lurking for a while on this one and I think it is fairly obvious you have all been scammed.&nbsp; In fact you people should be ashamed for falling for such a horrible scam, did you really think you would get 10 stars free if he sent you 3 or 5, because he needs to get his money back, well I hate to break it to you, but selling 13 hits of acid for 20 bucks is not how you make your money.<br /><br />Second did you read his resend policy, do you really think any vendor will send once, then send another, then refund you if the second doesnt arrive?!? are you all just that stupid.&nbsp; <br /><br />But he is such a nice guy, he was on the forums, he really helped me out, DUH! you think someone that wants your money is going to treat you like a dick! of course not, they are going to say whatever it takes to get that money out of your hands.<br /><br />And as someone who has worked with the people that lay real LSD in this country. his gummy stars are just plain stupid, if he was dropping L onto gummy stars dont you think you could pick a better medium for selling on SR, since after all you can drop it on anything.&nbsp; and he says he was putting the L in the mix of the gummy bears, well then that is just silly.<br /><br />Hate to break it to everyone but you have fucked off and screwed over.

				Furthermore, If there is so much controversy regarding this new seller, especially at this point, why have the current listings not been frozen until this situation comes to a conclusion? I just noticed there are 9 listings up under LSD, and people who do not frequent the forums are still ordering and finalizing early due to the 100% reputation -.-<br /><br />If this is a scam, Gummystars is making out like a king<br /><br />

				Why bother responding to messages???&nbsp; COME ON MAN...think about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION is the key to keep the scam going for as long as possible.&nbsp; He wouldn&#039;t have made as much if he stopped communicating with you.&nbsp; You want to believe in this fantasy of LSD gummy stars so bad and he feeds into that by talking to you the whole time...making you feel safe and secure so that you don&#039;t worry and start worrying in the forums or changing your rating for him.&nbsp; &nbsp;SHIT if I had bought from him I would have changed my rating from the perfect 5 for 5&#039;s that he is getting to a 1 at least until I get my stars at which point I would be happy to change it back.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been on the SR for awhile you will know we&#039;ve seen this thing before....it wasn&#039;t LSD candy to make your mouth water and your brain turn off...it was well written descriptions of PURE Crystal and bullshit labels.&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe the communication was really good while it lasted too.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now he comes on and says he will take down the listings...which as i write this he hasn&#039;t done...and if you don&#039;t get your stars by SATURDAY you will get your money back.....OMG it&#039;s tuesday...so wait another 4 days and then I&#039;ll take care of you.&nbsp; PLEASE.....<br />

Seriously, go read the past scam threads and LEARN from your mistakes! stop being so eager and throw BTC at the first too good to be true listing! always stay in escrow, and if you even think about releasing early, MAKE SURE IT&#039;s A VERY REPUTABLE SELLER!! <br />Good luck to ya&#039;ll. learn from this and move on with your life. and karma is a bitch for sure!!!

				thanks to those who bought my warning listing. we got it up close enough to the top to hopefully help some people save their coins. I canceled your orders this morning since he appears to be gone. keep your eyes out for others trying to pull shit like this. I will deploy listings like this from my account (I don&#039;t actually sell here, seller accounts were free when I signed up) Maybe more sellers will post listings like this before real money is lost.

				don&#039;t post the address! that is just plain wrong, scammer or not. I was just curious about the city. it might help to link some other scammers from here and elsewhere to being the same person. that could help figure out who they are by the way they speak in PM and their posting habits/ time zone. early detection of scammers is key! but bashing someones face in and posting pictures, or killing them isn&#039;t going to stop them, it will only stop them from using a scam seller account for purchases. making them harder to spot.<br /><br />the other side of that coin is scammer obfuscation. what was to stop him from having an ounce of weed sent to someone in iowa to throw the dogs off of the scent. I know that is a bit of a stretch to send an OZ for that, when just about anything off of the road could do the same thing, but what if you pummel some random pot-head who happened to be the target of some Bullshit that Gummy was planning? <br /><br />Bottom line is, I have read about other scams both buyer and seller from a small town in Iowa, and wanted to know if this was the same small town. Nothing more.<br /><br />finalization should be delayed, end of story. SR should force it, just like TFM does. if you try to confirm one of their shipments same day, you get a WTF error. I know Silk isn&#039;t here to babysit, but it would have saved alot of people a lot of money.

				This has got to be one of the most intense dramatic events that I have ever seen unfold on SR. As for what happened, I have to agree with a slightly modified &quot;slutwalk&quot; logic, we should teach not-to-scam at least as much as not-to-get-scammed. Right now there are no disincentives to scam people on here, sure people will bitch and moan and yell and threaten, but that, in my months on here, has never done anything to reverse or fix the scam. <br /><br />We need to, as a community, provide the disincentive necessary to stop scammers. An example must be made of a scammer who we are certain is a scammer beyond a reasonable doubt. We must also, however, be careful not to provide these disincentives to people who made honest mistakes. The hardest part of all this is finding the line between the two in this kind of charged environment.

				A large part of the disincentive could be that we are a community of honest, good-hearted people that nobody in their right mind would want to scam.&nbsp; It&#039;s an overly optimistic way of thinking, but it could be a surprisingly powerful.&nbsp; Obviously much more would be needed to minimize scamming, but I don&#039;t think &#039;an eye for an eye&#039; is the proper method.

				Boy it sure is easy to talk shit in a forum huh?<br /><br />sam with the little &quot;s&quot;,&nbsp; what is your interest in this situation anyway? It&#039;s pretty curious to me how fast you&#039;ll jump on anybody&#039;s post who&#039;s selling LSD, and you only have negative things to say about the transactions taking place, and transaction that happen to be none of your business, accept to watch the post and see if the vendors rep checks out or not. That being said I find it all a bit curious how you try to hi-jack these post, and stir up everybody&#039;s anxiety, which seems to serve no other purpose. If it&#039;s truly the welfare of others here on SR you&#039;re concerned about, then go and start a post asking others to not deal with these other LSD dealers. <br /><br />Are you dealing LSD too sam with the little&quot;s&quot;?<br />Is your product so lame you must stoop to these levels to eliminate the competition?<br />Or is it all just for a good laugh?<br />Or are you just a Kid, posing as an adult, cause grown folks know proper drug dealin etiquette?<br />And grown folks can figure the risk and cost involved for themselves when making a drug buy from an anonymous dealer online!<br />But thank God we&#039;ve got you here to keep our anxieties up during the whole process, what-would-we-do-without-ya-man?<br /><br />Let&#039;s all make sure to ask sam with the little&quot;s&quot; opinion, before we make our next deal now!.......

Are you getting these messages? And PLEASE edit that post! I am trying to remain a vendor here once this is all fixed and that is info that does not need to be disclosed on the forums! LTTM has one of my best friends address and I have asked her to save it and feel free to post it EVERYWHERE on the forums in the next few days if she still feels I am a scammer. But that was not needed at all and I am politely asking you to please remove it!<br /><br />Second to the guy who asked about DCN&#039;s sorry I forgot what your username was by the time I got this far into the message&nbsp; :-[ You may have missed it earlier, but I thought I had posted at one point stating that the DCN&#039;s weren&#039;t even registering for me and that is why I was beginning reshipping tomorrow 5 packages at a time, to make sure that I did EVERYTHING correctly this time. I spoke with another vendor and I am almost positive now that it was because I did not add the extra correct postage for the extra DCN. Forgive me if I am wrong and I hadn&#039;t posted that already, but I thought I had&nbsp; :-[

Mrgrey&#039;s request would have changed a LOT of things if you had answered him at the time, this is a TIME SENSITIVE ISSUE i am talking about, DCN are irrelevant now, why did you dodge him day&#039;s ago when he asked and it would have served as proxy tangible evidence?<br /><br />2. Do not go into business if you don&#039;t know how to run a business if you don&#039;t know the correct postage you need to research more before jumping into something that can hurt everyone<br /><br />3. Give people their money back if that&#039;s what they ask for, don&#039;t give them more gummystar&#039;s, give them their money back !<br /><br />I have to add a 4th here<br /><br />4. If you can&#039;t keep up with the messages being sent to you, you should not be vending here, if you forgot my name seconds after I posted, well wow.&nbsp; Even if you offered me 100 free samples, and I had a safe PO box in like Puerto Rico, I would still not take you up on it, simply because your business mannerisms are not that of a professional.<br /><br />If you&#039;d started doing things with a bit more business sense then perhaps this 21 page thread of used toilet paper wouldn&#039;t exist.

				so, did you already tear up his label or do you not know which order it was? I am getting confused.&nbsp; you would probably be better off if you hung up your seller&#039;s hat and just refunded everyone. you can write it off as a loss, people will be happy, and you can trip your own face off eating all the stars you have left. I know you already picked up some shipping supplies, but really, you forgot stamps. was the fake address a real address? what happens when someone reports a bunch of packages showing up on their doorstep with their address as the return? are these re-shipments leaving from a different ZIP code (better a different state)? or are you going to chance that too? you should just post an apology for getting in to something you didn&#039;t understand, send refunds, read about stamps, and how they work, then maybe try again in a year or two.

				&nbsp; I read this whole thread, bear in mind I don&#039;t have any vested interest, no buys, no rep here, and not a buy from Gummy. From looking it over, my guess is that folks will be receiving gummy stars by the weekend, provided Gummy is actually listening and refunding at least some buyers&#039; purchases.<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve shipped a lot of things, in volume. The photos look remarkably well staged for someone that at this point, doesn&#039;t have a reasonable dishonest motive in posting them. I just don&#039;t see the point in bothering if he&#039;s really a scammer. My guess, taking much of this at face value, is that Gummy really does have a supply, really does have the stars, and could afford the extras in establishing himself as a new vendor.<br />&nbsp; And wanted to make a hell of a big splash coming in as a new vendor. But he failed to do the proper research to set up his business, not doing the rl things that some of us can relate to, e.g. test market, correct shipping, customer expectations, etc, and he fucked up.<br />&nbsp; There&#039;s also the point of Gummy having made a purchase. Being new here, I don&#039;t know, but do scammers usually make purchases from their selling addresses? That too smacks of inexperience, just boneheaded misunderstanding about what we&#039;re really doing here.<br />&nbsp; mambosun and quinone have in the last couple pages been bringing up some valid points, and the fact that this has carried on as a discussion this long is really a testament to the community here, that this hasn&#039;t yet gotten too ugly. Yet. The points they&#039;ve brought up are valid, and the proof rests in whether refunds actually begin occurring. And the reshipments.<br /><br />&nbsp; Either this guy is the best lying motherfucker I&#039;ve ever seen (and I&#039;m good. Like, scary good) and this will end badly or this will go down in this site&#039;s short history as THE most epic misunderstanding ever and Gummy will get some business from me.<br /><br />&nbsp; But like I&#039;ve said in other posts, I&#039;m new here and I don&#039;t know shit about shit. Either way not a bad Wednesday evening.<br /><br />yakyak

				Hey, fuck it, you can overnight me some if it will make you feel better. I don&#039;t give a shit if you are LE, I have nothing here you can get me for anyway.<br /><br />It will prove you sent me some acid, but it won&#039;t prove you didn&#039;t rip any one off.<br /><br />FWIW, I think you&#039;re probably genuine anyways, so convincing me won&#039;t make much difference, but if you feel it will add credence to your situation then hit me up for my address.

				At this point I think it&#039;s likely that Gummy-Stars fucked up with postmarks. More importantly, why the fuck you people get so careless? <br /><br />There is a simple procedure that works:<br /><br />◄ new vendor sends out samples to trusted members of the forum<br />◄ trusted forum members confirm that they received sample and review the product and service<br />◄ vendor goes public with the goods.<br /><br />This way everyone can know that seller&#039;s packaging and shipping techniques are up to standard and works, and that s/he actually has the advertised product. <br /><br />Best of luck fixing this mess, Gummy-Stars.<br /><br />Bob A.

				Why gummy stars, bears and worms will never be a hit of acid!<br />1. lsd is soakes in to the fibers of paper hits!<br />2. gummys are like gelatin and cant soak in lsd. They have no fiber to soak in!<br />3. If you soak a gummy in water...the water will not enter the gummy, nor will lsd!<br />4. The one exception is if the chemist makes homemade gummies and has the lsd in the batter, before they harden!&nbsp; <br /><br />Are these so called gummys...HOMADE?&nbsp; MR. GUMMYSTAR ?

				DBone, <br /><br />Sorry man but your quite wrong about this. Gummy candies can easily be used as a means of conveyance for LSD. I have actually eaten several bears with liquid dropped onto them. A simple google search before posting would have cleared this up for you. Next time do a bit of research before immediately jumping to conjecture.<br /><br />1. Gummy candies actually soak up most liquids quite well. For example, I know people who soak gummy bears in vodka, and they normally swell up to about twice their original size, and do not &quot;leak&quot; any of the liquid out in transportation, eating, etc. Haha they can actually get you pretty fucked up.<br />2. Most liquid is an alcohol suspension of the LSD. Even if the acid wouldnt soak in as you claim, the alcohol would evaporate very quickly from the surface, and leave a surface residue of LSD. <br />3. Like Mambo said, I think he makes these himself anyway, negating your whole argument. <br /><br />Peace, people, lets give Gummy a chance, people make mistakes. I, for one, choose to trust in the general goodness of humanity, and I mean, how many people mess with Lucy and arent good people? Not many in my experience. I could be wrong, but lets just stow the hate for a few days and then he will either be vindicated or not. And then everyone can beat their chests even harder.

				Hey, well I would definitely take some gummy stars, in terms of being someone that you send some to to prove you&#039;re legit...I don&#039;t have many posts, but I&#039;ve been posting the last few days and keeping up with it...I also sent you a few messages...that being said, I doubt you&#039;ll do it for me, but it&#039;s worth a try lol.

What alot of newbies don&#039;t figure is that there is a COST to receiving free samples - giving up an address.<br /><br />If the free samples are worth $5, then you&#039;re giving up an address and thus INFORMATION to someone totally unproven for 20 quarters.<br /><br />That information is worth a helluva lot more than $5 to me. Maybe that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />Just looking for everyone to put it in perspective and stay safe...

				i think that it&#039;s more likely that GS is a scammer, given that he probably only returned 1 person&#039;s money... if he is LE, then that sucks because I gave the safe address of a friend of mine and my friend is now going to get flagged... good thing my friend is a goody two shoes that would never do anything remotely illegal and that my friend doesn&#039;t really check his mail there because my friend has a personal P.O box and i have the key to my friend&#039;s home mailbox hahaha. <br /><br />my friend will be fine, but my friend will be pissed off about it so i&#039;m sure i will have to stop using it... my friend will be pissed because i told my friend i would be getting mail there because my roomates were stealing my shit! i&#039;m sure my friend will be pissed when they realize what i ordered to their home (hope i don&#039;t lose a friend over it...) my friend will be even more pissed to know that i havn&#039;t been using my name on the deliveries, which is kind of going to suck, but i hope my friend understands (probably won&#039;t....)<br /><br />with regards to myself, i keep my stash somewhere else so i&#039;m totally not worried, i wouldn&#039;t place orders to my home ever, but that&#039;s just me.. i value my freedom... but it kind of sucks knowing i probably won&#039;t be able to mail anything there (and probably lose a friend :(...) it will be funny though if LE actually goes after my friend for 1 gummy sample for which there was no payment... it will be even funnier if they actually go through with whatever they plan and find nothing there. but i&#039;m pissed i gave out the address....... oh well i guess it&#039;s time to find a new place... won&#039;t be placing orders for a lonnnnng time i guess.... stoked i&#039;ve been broke and i&#039;m not expecting anything there!!!<br /><br />still hoping GS comes through... but at this point, i expect the worst. i&#039;d rather him be a scammer than LE!<br /><br />update this bitch if anyone gets their shit.... i&#039;ll wait till tomorrow before i have the talk with my friend....

He has been asked numerous times to produce DCNs but he always refused, he read the posts asking for DCNs and conveniently just keeps forgetting to address that fact. even people that ordered from him asked for THEIR DCNs and he says i cant give them for security reasons. bullshit!&nbsp; <br /><br />And this whole I order to my friends house, really who are you trying to convince, hahaha you fucking idiots... <br />

That doesn&#039;t change my opinion on the guy, and it shouldn&#039;t change yours. Even if he is a legitimate vendor, he has been handling his orders with zero professionalism and in this kind of business that just doesn&#039;t cut it.

So what is this all about?<br /><br />And what would I be &quot;stringing&quot; this along for? I&#039;ve taken down all my listings so nobody can place an order until this is fixed.

They are still in escrow and their packages were resent today. So what am I gaining from this?

				Look Gummy, no offense, but there&#039;s just no excuse for an overnight express mail package sent on Thursday not to arrive on Saturday.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m wrong, and if I do receive a package on Monday coming here to clear things up will be the first thing that I do.<br /><br />Until then I recommend everyone that&#039;s still in escrow with Gummy to use the resolution center to get their coins back.

				DCNs arent tracking numbers...<br /><br />GummyStars I hope you come through but you seem to sound on here like you are taking care of your customers, and refunding peoples money... but I have not heard from you. So I am not convinced. I am however fairly perturbed how the numerous addresses were supposedly so carelessly handled, and that my package never arrived but you never contacted me to explain your situation. Yet you claim to be legit? My 1/5 will remain until I am satisfied obviously.<br /><br />Oh, and I am gonna need about $700 bucks, since I immediately flushed my entire stash when I read you were LEO. A vial would cover it.

				To all whom have been inquiring about what were going to do with this guy, please use encryption. And no, I will not need funds.. he&#039;s right up my alley and as of tomorrow I will be quite busy tracking him and gathering information, my customers will be notified of delays. To whom who suggest it&#039;s his friends address. Who cares, with enough cash and time investigating you can find his ex, his enemy&#039;s.. pay a visit to his own mother.. everyone has a price. I will be writing a diary and taking photo&#039;s as progress is made. When he get&#039;s dealt with, I will post everything for all scammers to see.

				I&#039;m not saying he isn&#039;t a scammer -- he may very well be.&nbsp; But since he sent me the tracking number for an express package that say the post office picked it up late last week and that it&#039;s due to be delivered on the 13th, I&#039;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Not his fault if the post office is slow as shit.<br /><br />React however you like, but personally I think all these threats are for queers.

				This is just fucking embarrassing. Internet tough guys everywhere. <br /><br />You would have to be straight up retarded to threaten violence on this forum, I can absolutely guarantee you that there is some authority that is watching this page and as soon as you post the address either Gummystars is going to get a visit from the police, or whichever internet tough guy who threatened gummystars is going to be caught as well along with gummystars. Scammers should be taught a lesson, just be smart about doing it. Don&#039;t post someones address on a forum that has had articles written about by magazines and tv shows doing reports on it. For the love of god don&#039;t post the address here. You guys cannot be that stupid and incompetent.<br /><br />If you like Silk Road and the services it provides, just stop for a second and think about what you are about to do.

				Has everyone learned their lesson yet on not following SR guidelines concerning escrow?<br />If not please keep finalizing early and losing your btcs.<br />Just because a vendor tells you to finalize early doesn&#039;t mean that you have to do it.<br />There are plenty of professional vendors working strictly within the guidelines and have a shit ton of happy customers.<br /><br />Remember my lovely community just because something you want is only accessible today via a ridiculous claim for you to finalize early doesn&#039;t mean tomorrow there won&#039;t be someone right there willing to do it correctly and you not have to bypass any guideline.<br />&quot;Eager Beaver Syndrome&quot; is a bitch, don&#039;t let it take your precious btc&#039;s from you.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath

				The verdict is in: Gummy-Stars is 100% legit.&nbsp; Packaging is by far the most elaborate that I&#039;ve yet to see on SR.&nbsp; There is absolutely NO WAY any postal worker would ever assume that it&#039;s illicit drugs.&nbsp; Aside from not being able to test the product everything is grade A+.<br /><br />Congrats Gummy-Stars.&nbsp; Now lets have a fucking party.

				I am ready to see the hat eating video as well!<br /><br />one question first though, do the stars appear to be homemade, or could I run out to the candy store and buy a pack of them? because shipping store bought gummy candy to someone to prove you deserve peoples money is not out of reach. I really hate to continue the negative campaign against gummy-stars, but one possible reason I see for actually sending you something could be that Silk locked his account from being able to withdraw the BTC he had in it until things started showing up. <br /><br />I am glad you got something, so the hat eating should begin tonight, but praise should be held until others start getting deliveries, or you eat a star and tell us how fucking hard you tripped from it!

				Don&#039;t get too excited yet...GummyStars isn&#039;t even near out of the water. I still say he shouldn&#039;t be allowed to post any products until everyone else who has ordered from him receives their order that he has &quot;shipped&quot; or receives a refund. I&#039;m not doubting him, I have already considered this a loss, but I don&#039;t think we should allow him to sell anymore until all his wrongs are made right. I&#039;m sure everyone else would agree with me.

				Good question branflakes.<br /><br />I talked to Mambo in PM and discussed some things a few days ago.&nbsp; You can never tell who you are speaking to on the internet, esp. TOR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would personally like to see someone get these and test them before they allow GS to sell anything.&nbsp; At least more than 1 person should receive something and a bunch should get their money back.&nbsp; <br /><br />This things still seems totally bunk to me and I hate to say anything bad about anyone or anybody ( really ) but something about this entire thing still doesn&#039;t seem right.

				Also, I would like clarified why the original pictures in GS advertisement on the actual SR site looked nothing like the pictures MamboSun showed us previously on this thread.<br /><br />I mean MS&#039;s pictures looked awesome.&nbsp; So why wouldnt GS use this photo instead of a commercial sugary gummy that you buy in packs of 20 in the gas station?&nbsp; <br /><br />I never put an order in with this person and like I have stated I have no horse in this race other than making sure GS doesn&#039;t weasel his way into getting out of this somehow.&nbsp;

				Are you guys fucking kidding me?&nbsp; Gummy-Stars is legit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got the stars.&nbsp; He&#039;s proven himself.&nbsp; And just like with any other vendor - LSDirect, Mitanox, themunchies, etc, etc, etc - if you want to know if it&#039;s LSD you&#039;re just going to have to buy some and eat it yourself.&nbsp; This is the way it&#039;s been and it&#039;s the way it&#039;s always going to be.<br /><br />From what I can tell this thread is 90% blabbering from people that have no connection to Gummy-Stars at all.&nbsp; If his methods don&#039;t meet your standards then shut your mouths and move along.&nbsp; At this point people can decide for themselves if they want to deal with Gummy-Stars.

				Yeah, but Mambo, this hasn&#039;t been the case with all people ( vendors ).&nbsp; Not one of those vendors you mentioned had a start anything close to resembling this.&nbsp; I have been on SR for about 1/2 a year now and this is by far the biggest &#039;gotcha&#039; I have seen.<br /><br />If Gummy is indeed legit I would say someone but you should receive something and try it.&nbsp; At least get some fuck around town to try one Mambo, it isn&#039;t like you are losing out on much.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thing is<br /><br />1) You are the ONLY person to ( supposedly ) see these<br /><br />2) He has taken over $1000 of BTC from other members of this site and not delivered anything ( to my best knowledge )<br /><br /><br />

I think you have to take into account the scope of this thread and what unfolded over the course of a fuck ton of posts. Some people didn&#039;t get their money refunded or their stars. My advice to Gummy-Stars is to scrap this thing and start out fresh if he&#039;s really legit. Find a new and lighter medium to lay your LSD onto and assuming you&#039;ve learned from your mistakes, you won&#039;t have something like this hanging over your head.<br /><br />Over and out.

				Mambo..you are the only one here who received so far. I am making zero accusations here as far as association with GS and what not but..Buy a tester kit and test that shit out for LSD to even see if its safe, you have a slight duty considering the gravity of the last 42(?) pages to let everyone know the answer here. Or fucking eat one before bed and trip balls for a night. I have done acid in school for gods sake, you can do it in your own home. <br /><br />2 ways I see it here:<br />1. You have the gummy stars and are legit about everything (I really don&#039;t wanna re-read all this and confirm but if i remember you are pretty legit, MXE is taking my concentration away) and you LEGITLY don&#039;t have time to eat one..<br />2. You are paid off by GS to bullshit us all..or some sort of end-of-the-world type scenario here..so that GS doesn&#039;t have to refund, explain, etc.<br /><br />Honestly..This whole thing needs to be put to bed. Its a fuckin mess..<br /><br />-NS

				Hey Mambo.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So you think he&#039;s legit because he sent you some Gummy Stars?&nbsp; Do you know if they contain LSD?&nbsp; Answer: No.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you give one to a friend and get a report?&nbsp; &nbsp;I was his very first order and have yet to get anything, along with everyone else.&nbsp; Try to be objective.&nbsp; We have one person (You) who received anything but won&#039;t do it , test it, or allow anybody else to.&nbsp; Even a blind man can see this is VERY suspect.

				+1 to the dipshit part<br /><br />I came in here over 3 weeks ago, back before any of this shit and told you it was a scam when Gummy refused to give out DCNs and made up something security measures. When he was then asked to produce them by SR he said he did not have them anymore. If it was not for your tireless campaigning his scamming would have been called out ages ago and maybe some people would not have gotten fucked over.&nbsp; <br /><br />I actually think Mambo still believes Gummy is all of a sudden going to deliver, are you really that stupid? Maybe everyone else is right in thinking you are in on the scam.&nbsp; Me personally, well I think you just got played like a little bitch.&nbsp; You are in every topic with your hand out begging for free samples, and in return you suck the vendors cock. All Gummy had to do was look at in of your past posts and he new he had the perfect sucker. <br /><br />Send Mambosun a sample and let him suck the gummycock!!!&nbsp; well how did that gummycock taste mambo? did it have any lsd in it?? haha fucking gimp

				I don&#039;t completely doubt that he did just use me to try and fool everyone, but there are still reasons to believe that other packages will come.&nbsp; The biggest being the mail is super slow this time of year - if I could remember the tracking number I&#039;d give it to you guys so you could see that it took 5 days for an overnight express package to arrive.<br /><br />In the end it doesn&#039;t really matter, though.&nbsp; This shits a bust and it&#039;s pretty much just time to move on.&nbsp; I hope everybody learned their lesson about staying in escrow with new sellers, even if they are legit.&nbsp; :-/

				Apologize?&nbsp; Haha, to who?&nbsp; Get real, man.<br /><br />My final stance is that I just don&#039;t know what the fuck Gummy-Stars deal is.&nbsp; He scammed some, he refunded some, he sent packages to some.&nbsp; What category do you put someone with this type of track record in?&nbsp; I don&#039;t fucking know, you decided for yourself and leave it at that.<br /><br />I&#039;ll agree that enough is most fucking definitely enough, though, and I&#039;ve been trying to leave this thread on the most useful advice for a couple posts now:<br /><br />Don&#039;t finalize early with new sellers.<br /><br />Bye bye thread.

				Has been interesting. Since I live in the USA, I am very skeptical with any new US vendor because of the threat with LE. I would need the guy to prove himself with multiple successful sales and reviews before I would even get close to sending my personal address or a box that could be connected to me.<br /><br />I&#039;m older than most here. I have been ripped off so many times from street dealers in the 80&#039;s that they&#039;re a little funny now. Nobody was hurt... I lost money then and he earned some. I got better at it and would buy 1000 blotters at a time and play the Johnny Apple Seed to my community. LSD is something special guys... so is MDMA, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc...<br /><br />Nobody was the victim here. Everyone had their part in the drama many of us watched. From what I can tell, no one was busted either... that would of been the biggest crime here. Hopefully some new guys learned a lesson where they do not need to lose money or worse.<br /><br />Though overpriced, SR has allowed people like me to obtain clean psychedelics. Let the new vendors earn their keep here (by not finalizing early) and stick with the true purveyors of LSD like Paper, Street, Mitanox, themunchies, darkbanana, etc...<br /><br />Hope I do not offend anyone here... and I know enough about myself to know I do not have that power anyways... all part of that grand illusion.<br /><br />

				holy crap, what an intense thread lmao.. I can&#039;t believe I read all of that. I really wanted Gummy to be legit, but turns out nothing ever came in cept for Mambo and then everyone ganged up on him. Which was surprising to me considering he was the only person acting sane throughout this tedious process.... Anyway, I really picked an awesome first thread to read through.

				EVERYBODY RELAX. <br />Me and my girlfriend have bought the GummyStars vendor account along with all of his stock. We saw how big of an opportunity this was from the beginning but we knew the original owner could never actually make it work. He does nothing but smoke all day long and has absolutely no motivation to get up and do anything. So were taking over for him.<br /><br />If you placed an order with the original GummyStars and still haven&#039;t received a refund or your stars please post it neatly below this.<br />e.x. Ididntgetmystars - My name is Ididntgetmystars and I purchased 10 stars I still have not received. Please resend my order.<br /><br />Now that me and my girl are out of school we have nothing but time to devote to this. She&#039;s also excited to post up some of her edibles lol. They&#039;re pretty fuckin bomb. We&#039;re also considering domestic molly but not sure if we want to take that big of a step yet haha.<br /><br />Thanks<br />GS<br /><br />EDIT:<br />List<br />Hillbilly300 - I&#039;ll post again My name is Hillbilly300. I haven&#039;t got my stars. I ordered 5. Was expecting 15 because I finalized early... Please resend my order.<br /><br />Trystlb72456 - my name is trystlb72456 and i purchased 15 stars i still have not received. Please resend my order.

				Four FACTS everyone needs to swallow:<br /><br />1) Gummystars was a scam, from the beginning.<br />2) If you gave Gummystars, a NEW vendor OUT of escrow ANY bitcoins, they are LONG GONE.<br />3) No NON-scamming person(s) bought the Gummystars account.<br />4) We&#039;ll probably never know whether Mambo was just a pawn in all of this or not.<br /><br />Did I miss anything?<br /><br />Signed, Rational People

				I definitely think Mambosun was in on it. I saw another thread on here the other day where he just recently took a hit of lsd, but he didn&#039;t take the gummystar he got. If he was complaining about not having any time to take the gummystar to let people know if it was real then why did he have the time to take another hit of lsd? Seems sketchy as fuck. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad I watched this whole thing play out. I learned a bunch.

				I can only assume that the sheer novelty of the idea made people want to jump on it.&nbsp; Or the lower prices.&nbsp; But why would it be cheaper to dose gummy stars with LSD (however the fuck that would even work, I dunno), than to dose blotter paper?&nbsp; There are so many holes in that idea I don&#039;t even know where to start!<br /><br />But all that aside, yeah, his behavior alone should have been enough to out him as a scam.&nbsp; Even if he&#039;d been selling blotter acid, offering an absurd, unprofitable deal to people who finalize early should be an immediate red flag, I think?

				As someone who got scammed by gummy stars, I bought them for a few reasons:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; They were promoted as having a higher than average dose than a typical blotter.&nbsp; <br />2.&nbsp; At the time, GummyStars was also one of the few (only?&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember) US-based vendors. I&#039;d been burned previously by attempting to buy LSD blotter from a reputable dutch vendor.&nbsp; The blotter never arrived (I believe it was seized). <br />3.&nbsp; They were inexpensive (given the dose). <br />4.&nbsp; LSD in gelatin form is less exposed to air/light, which means it will degrade at a lower rate. <br />5.&nbsp; Gummy stars look like candy.&nbsp; Barry Cooper (former police officer, produced &quot;Never Get Busted&quot; video) said that he had never busted someone for drugs in the form of an edible.
