				okay so i have done ecstacy in pill form before but i know it had stuff other than just mdma in it. i have done it very few times though. i recently just bought some white mdma crystal from the road here and it was great no complaints or anything, it totally did its job. but i notice that there is tan mdma and white mdma, and i always see mda which i understand is a by-product of making mdma. what i want to know is what is the difference in the white and tan mdma? is one a higher quality or is it just a different making progress? and&nbsp; how do they differ from each other? also how is mda different in effect or dosage than mdma? i know these or newbie questions but i kinda enjoy the stuff and i would like to learn a little about it from experienced users before i start spending more money on it. thanks for any input ladies and gentlemen<br /><br />~crazyburnout

				MDA has a higher efficiency stimulating the 5-HTP receptor than MDMA does so the effects are much more visual and last a fair bit longer. MDA is also much less predictable than MDMA, so the effects from person to person can very widely (positive or negative). It&#039;s also quite a but more toxic and places more stress on your central nervous system and cardiovascular system. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know the answers to the other questions but I hoped this helped! :)

				The color of MDMA is not an indicator of purity. The stuff that causes the coloration is less than 1% of the total mass. The color comes from unreacted residual precursors or reaction byproducts.

				different colors jus mean the product hasnt been washed after its been made,it doesnt reflect on the purity of it.im not too sure about mda tho i do know it hits you harder than mdma&nbsp; 8)
