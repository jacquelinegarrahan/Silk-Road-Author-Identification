				Don&#039;t trust Bruce. That&#039;s the best advice I have for you while you&#039;re here. He will lure you in with candy and then the next thing you know you are the father and mother of 8 children. Its not worth it.

				I don&#039;t see why you place any value on karma, it&#039;s an inconsistent system that is not always representative of authentic views on a user.

				Because if someone new comes by, and doesn&#039;t know any better, they&#039;ll see the karma and get either good or bad thought about that person.&nbsp; And it&#039;s never good to be thought bad about.

				That&#039;s assuming that all new people are stupid and can&#039;t see that anyone can intentionally give negative karma out of no real good reason.

				Hey man! My name is ________, you can call me whatever. <br /><br />I love making new friends and meeting new people.<br /><br />I&#039;m new here(sorta) and psychedelics are my thing. I used to be an avid pot smoker, but unfortunately my new job has made me kick that hobby. I was a member of the SR for about two years before I decided to make a purchase and then I realized I didn&#039;t remember my pin so here I am starting fresh. I&#039;m a good ole country boy from the USA. I love drinking, hanging out, shootin shit, fishin and huntin. I hate the federal government, they are a bunch of crooks. <br /><br />Well there is my random about me. If anyone can track me down with just that info, touche to you sir, touche. <br /><br />See ya around, PsychedelicSphere
