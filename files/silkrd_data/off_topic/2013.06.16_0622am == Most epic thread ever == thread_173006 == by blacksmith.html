				Walked down a dope/coke-set (I&#039;m white) when I was 17; in a major city, in a not-so-good neighborhood to score some coke and pills. I think I was the only one not-strapped. I wasn&#039;t hurtin&#039; for the drugs, but I didn&#039;t know where else to get em other than faggot burby douchebag kids. The type you just don&#039;t trust...<br /><br />Even sketchier, I know mad people who&#039;ve been mercked in Camden NJ and Trenton NJ looking for dope or pills. Makes me look back like &quot;damn, I was so lucky... &quot; <br /><br />Live and learn!

				I once bet a guy 5â‚¬ that I could eat an entire fucking onion within five minutes. It was on a party and I was wasted on 25i and alcohol. I later invested the money in some weed :D

				Couple years ago I got kicked out of my parents house. I was over my friends house doing some coke, and I had the brilliant idea to go rob cars. I stayed up all night breakibg&nbsp; into every car on my own block until like 5 in the morning. Here I am walking around homeless with a backpack full of stolen shit. Cops started comin around, one pulled up to me and told me to be careful because someone has been robbing everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank god I look like I&#039;m 12. He must of thought I was on my way to school or something. I ended up sleeping under a bridge that night.

				The bong water was damn near black and brown and the smell makes me want to vomit to this day. And it wasn&#039;t even a proper bong, it was a coke bottle wayyyyy back in the day. It probably gave us all cancer. But it was worth it I guess. <br /><br />I got to throw bologna at a bitch&#039;s titties and ass at a party for Xanax bars once.
