				Right people!&nbsp; <br />we have a big announcement! <br /><br />TSC prides itself in offering the highest quality products that are available to source. We go to insane measures, paying, smuggling, travelling across the world just to find the kind of stuff that is unavailable anywhere else. We are so proud of the fact that a large percentage of you guys claim that out hash is the best on the road that I took it upon myself to personally search out other products that you would feel the same way about. <br /><br />One of my travels to source more hash took me to a small island off the coast of morocco where some travellers were raving about some weed they had bought in a small farming village near the coast in southern spain, these seasoned smokers were declaring this stuff to be the best they had ever had! How could I pass that up. So I journeyed 800km back to europe to the same coastal town and secured a steady supply. Now I have bought 200g as a tester batch to offer out to you people so you can tell me what you think. Everyone that has tried it so far has been fucking amazed at the quality and the high. over the next few weeks we will be modifying shipping methods and prices! I will put the trial listings up shortly. <br /><br />As with all our new products freebies will be put up in competitions in exchange for feedback<br />ACE
