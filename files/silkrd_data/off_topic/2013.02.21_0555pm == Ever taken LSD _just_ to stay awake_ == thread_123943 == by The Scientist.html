				Out of amphetamine and I have to stay awake for the next 24 hours. I only have LSD, mushrooms, ketamine, valium, weed, caffeine, and DMT. I want to save the mushrooms because I only have a few of them left. Desperate times call for desperate matters. Ever been in a pinch where staying awake was key and the only thing at your disposal was LSD (or any other psychedelic)?

				lol<br /><br />i have, actually.<br /><br />i helped throw a rave and was also selling acid there.&nbsp; every time i made a sale i would also take a tab, so i ended up tripping pretty damn good.&nbsp; well, end of the night came (beginning of the morning, actually) and i had to move a bunch of sound equipment and take down deco and clean and shit.&nbsp; so i took more acid and it did indeed keep me awake and fueled to do what i needed to do.<br /><br />in your case though, i think it might work against you.&nbsp; in my case i was already adjusted to trip space when i needed to get shit done.&nbsp; if u must do this, you should probably drop acid at least 4 hours before you have to start doing shit.

				You said you have caffeine available. I don&#039;t understand why you would even consider wasting your LSD and possibly fucking up what you&#039;re staying awake for in the first place.

				So you have caffeine, a stimulant that is basically designed for the sole reason of keeping you awake, and you want to take a psychedelic instead? Are you sure you aren&#039;t tripping already?<br /><br />EDIT: Ballz beat me to it

				you could try &quot;micro-dosing&quot; LSD, <br />but easier would probably be to use your K to stay awake - when you use little of it that&#039;s what it does: keep you awake... <br />
