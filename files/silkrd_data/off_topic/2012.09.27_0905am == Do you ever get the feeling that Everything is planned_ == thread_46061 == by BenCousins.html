Gangnam style is a more popular topic than any real world issue going on in America. Its painful for me to watch the masses eat shit like this up, its like jingling car keys in front of an infant. Is there really any other reason for &quot;pop culture&quot; than to keep people focused on bullshit that doesnt matter?

				Agree with Mr Less. There&#039;s no conspiracy. People are really that dim. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to believe the contrails were dosing us with sweet, sweet soma. But if that were the case, we&#039;d all be happier. Wouldn&#039;t we?

				I have no clue what gangnam style is and I guess thats a good thing...?&nbsp; I do sometimes get the feeling that POP culture is just a distraction to keep peoples minds occupied while the powers that be continue to do whatever the fuck they please with our tax dollars.
