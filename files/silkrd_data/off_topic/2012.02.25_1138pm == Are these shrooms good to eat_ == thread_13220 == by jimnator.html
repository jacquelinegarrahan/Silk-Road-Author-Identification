				I once went outside looking for shrooms. I found some mushrooms, ate them, got extremely sick, and had to go to the emergency room. I was so embarrassed when they asked what I ate to get so sick I said wild mushrooms. They asked why I explained I wanted to get high. Man that was a rough night I puked had diarrhea... it was awful. A nurse laughed at me&nbsp; :-[&nbsp;

				without looking a the pic...<br />Ask yourself...<br />a/ Is the vendor reliable? (sold shrooms with good feedback)<br />b/ Are they wild or specifically grown from known strain?<br /><br />Because if it was me I would not trust anyone with wild picked shrroms and on the flip side I would not trust myself giving wild picked to anyone.<br /><br />Research edibles and poisonous mushrooms and note the similarities and the proximity they grow next to each other.<br /><br />Im not saying the vendor doesnt know his shit but I am saying it is easy to fuck up.<br /><br />A couple(1?) of chinese nationals died in Aus recently because they ate death caps that looked liked an edible.<br /><br />It is doable for an amateur to ID a mushroom when it is fresh. (spore colour, bluing if active, gill colour etc)&nbsp; It is a lot harder to do once dried.<br /><br />Blue meanies? lol imo amateur listing. What stain is it?

He doesn&#039;t sell normally, he said he had grow too much and wanted to sell the extra. He grows them himself. As well as, he didnt say what strain it was from but he said he always try new strains

				I thought all amateur shroom growers keep records of what strain it is especially if they are selling them.<br />Blue meanies is a nickname for Copelandia Cyanescens but mostly a nickname for active mushrooms given by people who dont know what it is but &quot;appears&quot; to be active because it stains a blue colour.<br /><br />I stand to be corrected though ;)

				They look fine and if you got them from a somewhat reputable vendor you&#039;re fine.<br />Just eat everything in the bag, including the shake.<br />If you&#039;re squeamish and don&#039;t like the taste then people I know have put them in a blender with orange juice.<br /><br />Mushrooms are a great psychedelic, have fun!
