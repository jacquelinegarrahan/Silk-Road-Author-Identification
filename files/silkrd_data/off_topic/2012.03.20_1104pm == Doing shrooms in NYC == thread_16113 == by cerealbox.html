				I&#039;m gonna be doing shrooms for the first time with my best friend in NYC.&nbsp; What should we do and where should we go? Any part of NYC that&#039;s best to hang out in? I mean, near bleeker is great for drinking, but shrooms... I dunno Central Park? I also had the idea of going to a magic show, but my friend who has more experience with shrooms assured me it wouldn&#039;t be an amazing, mind-blowing experience, but rather I&#039;d giggle nonstop or just not enjoy it. Should I stay away from people for the most part so people don&#039;t know I&#039;m high? We normally just drink and smoke pot at the apartment, but I&#039;m told staying inside isn&#039;t a good idea with shrooms. But if we did, what would we do? Watch comedy? Watch something messed up? (I love watching dark, serious movies like Precious stoned - they&#039;re fucking hilarious).

				Definitely Central Park.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t handle being around people when you&#039;re high (fear of people knowing you&#039;re high or it&#039;s just annoying to you) than New York isn&#039;t a great place to be high in...<br />I rolled one time there and it was really fun!&nbsp; I&#039;d love to try acid or shrooms but sometimes I kinda give it away that I&#039;m really high ;D<br /><br />Wherever you decide to go I hope you enjoy it, New York can be a really fun place but you&#039;ve gotta know the right things to do.

				My dream has been to do acid in NYC- ever since I first took lsd that has been the one place I want to try it- lately tho I have been getting weird around people while on pysceldelics so I think im going to take a break and try it once I find myself is a more &#039;stable&#039; I guess situation- do central park -ride the merry go round, climb on the rocks (thats my favorite thing to do in central park) find a sick spot to check out the bridges- hit the village<br />have a fucking blast- Im so very jealous- you&#039;re going to have an amazing time

				I would advise against Times Square. Way too many people, and that&#039;s just begging for a freakout. I nearly freakout even when NOT on psychedelics, AND I&#039;m definitely no stranger to the crowds. I would also definitely advise against going to Times Square or down to the village (east or west) on the weekend. Trust me on this.<br /><br />I would say for harm reductions sake, you should stay inside until the shrooms have kicked in, and THEN see how you feel...especially since you&#039;ve never done them before. You might find that watching the bathtub fill up is the most beautiful thing you&#039;ve ever seen :)<br /><br />For the most part, being out in public and coming up on a drug you&#039;ve never done, and don&#039;t know your reaction to could be a recipe for a very uncomfortable time. Wait until you&#039;re an experienced psychonaut (and know your reaction to mushrooms) before you go making big plans for a public outing<br /><br />If you have roof access, I recommend going up there and watching the sky. That&#039;s pretty fun.<br />I did shrooms last week at a friends place, and we stayed indoors...it was one of my most fun mushroom experiences ever (thanks Galindoi!)<br /><br />We mainly laid in bed and listened to music. We also taped some big sheets of white paper to the walls... and would occasionally get up and draw all over them with colored markers. The next day you have some really fun art. <br /><br />Either way, have fun and best of luck!

				Ah sorry I missed the fact that you had never done shrooms before....I agree with MollyBloom in that case, once you have a little experience I highly recommend times square late at night 8)

				This was years ago, but last time I was tripping in the downtown area of a major city, I got pick-pocketed. Well I had fun until my wallet was gone. The guy was good too cause I had my wallet in the inner side pocket of my leather jacket at the time. It was one of those bump into you and snatch jobs. He didn&#039;t get much money, and I didn&#039;t have any credit cards then (thank god). Just be careful where you tripping at, be aware of people ready to take advantage of your &#039;distorted&#039; state of mind.

				If its your first time I&#039;d do slightly less than an eighth (like 2.5-3 grams) and 100% go to central park. This topic is actually really making me want to go do shrooms in central park sometime soon. It&#039;ll be such an adventure.

				I found out my parents are going to be out of town this weekend, so I&#039;m going to test my tolerance by eating just a stem. Then wait a few hours and see if I&#039;m okay to eat more. That way I&#039;ll be prepared for NYC the week after.

				I doubt you&#039;ll feel anything much off just one stem. You need .25 - .50 g for most people to feel even a hint of anything. <br />But every body is different... so meh<br /><br />I still say chew your dose indoors, wait 45 minutes and see how you feel, then go explore if you&#039;re feeling froggy<br /><br />I say this not only because of the inexperience with your reaction, but also because of the puke factor. <br />You don&#039;t want to be vomit-tey on the street, or subway, or even worse....a cab. Eww.<br /><br />Make sure to eat them on an empty stomach, and don&#039;t be surprised if you puke a few times anyway (especially if you take a high dose as someone suggested above). Don&#039;t fight it...that just makes it worse. You&#039;ll feel heaps better once you puke.<br />A few tablespoons of ginger or a few ginger candies really help with the nausea you might feel.<br />
