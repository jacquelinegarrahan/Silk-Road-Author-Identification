				Sometimes I look at people pigging out on food, and think of how it&#039;s not all that different to drugs, they way they are so addicted to certain substances.<br />I confess the the other day I ate like 2 whole boxes of these chocolate chip muffin things, they were just so fucking delishous.<br /><br />But I&#039;m pretty severly underweight... so I don&#039;t even care.<br />I confess, I do care...

				Ceiling cat said I jerk off too much :(<br /><br />Jelly legs, the only difference in people who overeat and people who do too many drugs is the social acceptance of one over the other. My wife and I talk about that alot. She is pretty much a tee totaler. Well, she was a tee totaler when I met her, after 7 years of marriage now she loves her some good acid or shrooms and she will usually hit a joint once or twice if I&#039;m smoking one (lol, I corrupted the fuck outta her, or freed her mind). Even though she doesn&#039;t do any drugs besides those and not often at all at that, she gives me room and doesn&#039;t bitch. It helps me to keep my own use under control since I don&#039;t have to hide it. I got some weird looks like week when I got VMM&#039;s meth and was geeked out a couple 100mg shots LOL. I always say, the only thing you should do in private is take a shit and masturbate, and the second one is negotiable. <br /><br />Hmm, maybe the point isn&#039;t so clear, but the only difference is social acceptance.<br /><br />Kurtz, this worries me, since history repeats itself. What if it absolves me twice and the second time undoes the first one? That would mean that every other cycle of history I would be good. Hmm, are you sure there is no other way?

				I think it&#039;s called culture, my friend :)<br />People with more weight on them in some cultures (men) are desirable by women because it shows that they can sustain themselves.<br /><br />A quick culture format by inhaling some DMT should do the trick, culture is not your friieennnd - Terrance McKenna.

				Without a doubt, much of what is consumed and called &quot;food&quot; is extremely addictive. The refined sugar I believe if consumed regularly is worse than doing cocaine on occasion. <br /><br />We are most likely all addicted in some way or another to certain foods. <br /><br />Pure natural living unprocessed food is a far cry from mcshits, twix bars, and taco bell or pizza hut. <br /><br />Not that I don&#039;t or haven&#039;t (even recently) eaten something fast, or processed... but I really work on my uptake of pure whole food types of supplements and try to minimize and limit all kinds of shit food. But you know... I value the vibrancy that comes from eating greens and juices. <br /><br />Just try for 2 days stopping eating bread, if you&#039;re a typical daily bread eater. You&#039;ll start buggin out like you wouldn&#039;t believe for a piece of bread. And this is not even going anywhere close to the billions of chemicals added to the food we buy in stores for all sorts of reasons. It&#039;s quite insane actually. <br /><br />Do you typically buy boxed foods? Mainstream brand names? Processed? Frozen? Everything frozen is worthless in regards to health. We have a health system that doesn&#039;t worry a shit about the food we eat, and food that has nothing to do with our health. <br /><br />We have better ways ;)<br /><br />

				At about 4:30 this morning I did eat half a bag of doritos.<br /><br />Ugh, reading this thread now I want more candy. Fuck I&#039;m addicted to candy, seriously. I eat ALOT of fucking candy. I&#039;m good for a family sized bag of mini-reeses cup every week in addition to random convenience store shit(random=twix and kitkat rotation).<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with yelling @ preschoolers, there are mostly little shits.<br /><br />I have to agree that shoving shit that tastes good down your throat is an addiction. I enjoy candy as much as I do drugs, no lie. I&#039;m just thankful no vendors on SR take advantage of that weakness by listing kitkat and the like with the drugs.

				Well, I&#039;ve done it again. I did kinda eat dinner tonight, though. I had a sandwich and some spicy chili doritos, but that was hours ago. I just made a run to the store and got me a king size Reeses sticks, king sized KitKat and a whatchamacallit, or however you spell it. I already ate it first and the wrapper is gone and no spell check for candy bar names. I also got a liter of pepsi. Last night was mountain dew, gotta keep shit in rotation, dig?<br /><br />I blame Mom n Pop&#039;s Jack Herer for tonights midnight munchie run. Holy shit is that some stout grass! Whoever grew it did a mighty fine job, mighty fine.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m all jacked up on sugar now. <br />
