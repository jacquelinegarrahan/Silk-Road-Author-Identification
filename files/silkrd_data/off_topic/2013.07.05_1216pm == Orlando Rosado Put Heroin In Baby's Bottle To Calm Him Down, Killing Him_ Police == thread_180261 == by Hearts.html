				PHILADELPHIA — A Philadelphia man charged with putting heroin and methadone in his infant son&#039;s bottle to quiet him, but instead killing him, was convicted Tuesday of third-degree murder.<br /><br />Orlando Rosado, 46, did not testify at the one-day trial, but the defense said Rosado accidentally put the drugs in the baby&#039;s 3 a.m. bottle during a heroin relapse. His son, Christopher, died two days shy of his first birthday in May 2012.<br /><br />Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said she based her verdict in the nonjury trial partly on Rosado&#039;s conduct afterward, when he gave changing statements to police, including an attempt to blame the death on his 5-year-old daughter.<br /><br />&quot;I was appalled when I heard that,&quot; McDermott said.<br /><br />Yet McDermott says she knows Rosado regrets his actions. He told police his son was &quot;his heart and soul.&quot;<br /><br />The case opened a window into the world of two addicts, mother and father, who sought treatment after their daughter was born addicted to heroin in 2006, and were seemingly doing well. It&#039;s at least the second case in Philadelphia in which a baby died after drinking a heroin-laced bottle.<br /><br />Medical records show Christopher was healthy, if small for his age, and there was no evidence of prior abuse or neglect. Photographs show the house was neatly kept, and the boy&#039;s mother said Rosado handled the overnight feedings, and boiled water to make the formula. And a friend came every day at 7 a.m. to take him to a methadone clinic for treatment.<br /><br />&quot;He was pretty good with the baby,&quot; said the friend, Giovanni Nieves.<br /><br />But Nieves knew that Rosado was still using, buying both heroin and methadone on the street. He was also being treated for bipolar disorder.<br /><br />When Nieves arrived the morning of May 11, 2012, a hysterical Rosado ran outside carrying his limp, discolored boy.<br /><br />The baby had vomited into his bassinet, apparently as the drugs slowed and then stopped his breathing.<br /><br /><br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/orlando-rosado-heroin-baby-bottle_n_3535583.html?ir=Crime

				Whats worse is that when I went searching for the link (because earlier I couldn&#039;t get on forums since it was down... right?)<br />I googled &quot;Heroin Baby news&quot;, and I get this as well:<br /><br />Baby died after swallowing parents&#039; heroin<br />A 23-month-old baby died after swallowing heroin left next to his cot by his drug-addicted parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;Daniel Jones died in his parents’ bed after ingesting a wrap of the Class A drug on May 29 last year.<br /><br />His mother, Emma Bradburn, 34, was jailed for four years yesterday after admitting causing or allowing the death of a child.<br /><br />Because of time spent in custody she could be freed as soon as December 2014.<br /><br />Her partner Simon Jones, 30, was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to manslaughter, but under judicial guidelines he could be free by December 2015.<br /><br />Social workers had placed the baby on an “in need” register because of his parents&#039; drug addiction, but they removed him from the at-risk list weeks before his death. <br /><br />http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10159244/Baby-died-after-swallowing-parents-heroin.html<br /><br /><br />Ugh... keep your kids away from your dope god dammit! <br /><br />Its just pathetic how some peoples parenting can be...
