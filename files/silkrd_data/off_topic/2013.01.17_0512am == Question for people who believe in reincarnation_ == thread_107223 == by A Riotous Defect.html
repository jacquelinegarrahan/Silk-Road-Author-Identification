				I don&#039;t know if anyone in here believes in reincarnation, but if you do I was wondering what you do to explain the continuation of the soul when it comes to&nbsp; rising birth rates and all that fine mess?<br /><br />I had a phase in my life where I worshipped the Goddess Fortuna and fucked around with Tarot cards all the time ( luckily for me I hadn&#039;t gotten to the point where I started wearing make up and nail polish, although I have been told my face is extremely ambiguous and could fit either gender if primped up ) and believed in reincarnation, and my explanation to myself was that at at one point when mankind was young there were a fewer number of souls, but the souls were &#039;fully-grown&#039; so to speak. When a person died, their grown soul would shatter into different seeds of life which create the next generation of humans. As this new generation grows, their soul grows with the experiences and individual lives that each person lives, and in turn when they die the process begins over again. The amount of &#039;soul seeds&#039; would vary from time to time which I wrote off as an explanation for the fact that it&#039;s not a straight-up correlation between ____ and amount of soul-seeds produced. <br /><br />Now, I also integrated a sort of past-lives sort of ideal to it as well, where I thought that the reason you might not remember exactly who you are or what you did, what time period you lived in, etc, etc., is because of the amount of seeds that were produced for your specific batch of seeds. Also, as you move further through the generations, the original souls get degraded and don&#039;t get recognized by people who are sensitive to their past identities. I don&#039;t think I know anyone or have seen anything on TV or the internet about people thinking they were fucking cavemen in their lifetime. <br /><br />But anyway, I&#039;m just a -tad- bit more rational now, and I really didn&#039;t completely believe all of that I just said, even when I practiced all this shit. I just thought it sounded pretty solid to me and I wanted a hobby other than playing video games and masturbating so I picked up a -sprirituality- which apparently is code in some language I&#039;ve created which means &quot;I&#039;m going to take a bunch of psychedelic drugs and empathogens and then try to divine messages from Fortuna or Eris in the smoke of the incense and cigarettes I&#039;m burning! That&#039;ll totally be more legit than a magic-8 ball!&quot; xD

				Well I know in Hinduism animals are included in re-incarnation, so maybe it is a correlation between animal population/human population?
