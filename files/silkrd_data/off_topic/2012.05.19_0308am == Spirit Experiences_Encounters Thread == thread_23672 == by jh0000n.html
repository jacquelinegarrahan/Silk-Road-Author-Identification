				I always thought that there could be a spirit world something more to life than what we can see physically day to day but I never truly believed until I had an encounter... I will never forget this experience until the day I die.<br /><br />To start ill give a little background. Im not a very spiritual person overall im not religiouse, im not a buddhist, I dont believe in magic etc. Well I was with this trini chick and she always told me that theres something special about her and that sometimes she&nbsp; sees spirits/demonds. This girl is also very religiouse and on top of that trini people are heavy into magic/voodo beliefs so I never really took what she said seriously....Well one day we decided to pop shrooms I ate 1/8 and she ate a couple grams. No big deal I wasnt expecting anything at all , I did the same exact shrooms a few days before and popped 7 gr had a good trip but nothing out of the ordinary.So we popped them and walked around a bit then came back to the building to go to my place, but I forgot my keys inside and everybody had left so we were stuck on the stairs. We decided to wait until someone returned and by this time I could feel the shrooms kicking in....she was sitting on the floor facing me and I was a couple stairs higher looking down at her. I cant remember when it started but I never did before and till this day never experienced anything like what came next...EVER <br /><br />I went into a trance and couldnt avert my stare from her eyes...they turned deep blue and I could see the ocean and stars like the milky way the colors were so beautiful I cant put it into words. Her forehead had a golden symbol on it with dots in a pattern around it and they all glowed in sequence, her brain was pushing the inside of her forehead and I could see her head bulging. Her skin looked like a lizard or snake with scales that where shinning all diffrent colours even some colours ive never seen before. There was this electricity in the air I heard a voice in my head talking to me&nbsp; I was terrified but it was so bueatiful and amazing I started crying. I saw visions of animals and places ive never been before, it told me &quot;your wrong&quot;...&quot;humanitys wrong&quot;...&quot;you only cause suffering&quot; ...&quot;the world is crying&quot;.<br /><br />There was more , it told me its name but I cant remember everything this happened more than 4 years ago. When I came out of the trance I was standing up and the girl was there just repeating my name...I was drenched in sweat and so exhausted I couldnt stand up and grabbed the rail and sat down. She told me I started mumbling and was shaking and crying just staring at her it seemed very long but was only a few minutes, I was COMPLETELY sober when it ended. She said she barely even felt the 2 g she took.<br /><br />To this day I dont know what that was God or a spirit but something communicated with me and used her as a means to do it...writing this brings back the same feeling I had and tears of joy to my eyes.

				My first breakthrough of a DMT trip... It&#039;s hard to explain but I, or rather my soul/spirit, was abducted by 3 aliens. Two were on either side of me and one was right above my head, kind of like a probing room or a hospital bed. They were digging something out of my brain by the tendril-full; I viewed it to be pain or weakness of some sort. The one right above my head, &quot;the main one&quot;, had an English accent. He was quit benevolent, but he loved sarcasm all too much. At the end he said &quot;You&#039;re welcome!&quot; as they dropped me off their spaceship and floated away on a hovering bench. <br /><br />The next dimension I traveled to 20 minutes later was a face to face meeting with another tendril-bearing alien. He wrapped his tendril around what felt like my soul, and I felt a shocking sensation; as if he was instilling me courage or a hidden superpower. He left shortly thereafter telling me, telepathically, never to forget what had happened here.<br /><br />Having experienced this contact made me wonder what the fuck is actually real. As of now though, I stay this course.

				This thread will be epic.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had any INSANE experiences on Psychs yet besides the ability to communicate some thoughts back and forth with friends.&nbsp; However, if someone told me they took a large dose of LSD and managed to walk through a wall I really would try and believe them.&nbsp; I think SO many things are possible that most people would just laugh at.

				I really suggest you try acid dude;<br /><br />If you&#039;d asked me two weeks ago if I believed in anything &#039;spiritual&#039; I&#039;d have pimp slapped you and told you to stfu. I&#039;m a man of science. But the other week on an acid trip (250ug if you believe the ratings), I had a spiritual experience. It&#039;s hard to explain but, there was a communication in the visuals, and in my mind. When you listen (or read) your mind isn&#039;t directly processing the letters and shapes. Instead they&#039;re processing the semantics of what that word means. It&#039;s a seamless process. Similarly, there were no words spoke. But I was gaining a great level of information from &#039;meanings&#039;. I&#039;d be riding the waves of the trip and communicating in a way I&#039;ve no concept of, then suddenly have these moments of clarity. Perfect, sober moments of clarity. And I&#039;d physically ask it questions out loud. And then the waves would come back and I&#039;d answer. I&#039;ve recently been told I might have liver cancer, and I&#039;m young (&gt;25). The news obviously hit me hard, but. My usual style of dealing with things is just not think about it &#039;que sera-sera&#039;. But I guess all my worries were addressed by lucy, and I felt totally at peace with the world, and now sober, I feel ready to accept any news someone could give me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Communicating what I felt in words does not cover it, there were so many dimensions and aspects to it. But the basic gist was that we shouldn&#039;t get hung up on the details of how and why were here. Or even whats after. Just existing is a fascinating thing. Our purpose in life is to exist. As our cells&#039; purpose in life is to exist, and plants and animals and trees and so on. I saw a framework to the world, and knew that this is how whatever I was communicating with sees the world, and how worlds are created. Everything seemed so logical.<br /><br /><br />Then, I had this sort of racing animation, of how all we know of science to the quark level could be applied to a higher degree. The scope of this animation is crazy, I&#039;ve never fathomed something so &#039;large&#039;. But in a similar way that cells contain several organelles, and each protein made of each amino acid sequence made of each pre-cursor molecule is made of atoms. And even past that, atoms are made of something. If you take this idea you can go infinitely smaller and smaller (atoms within atoms). But then you can also go the opposite way. And I raced through how each living thing on the world is contained in this tiny little sphere. Like a cell. Each living thing making its own impact on the world. When something dies it is replaced. We consume and excrete. We create. And the realisation that in all the galaxies we&#039;ve seen, each galaxy could be a cell, each planet could be an organelle, each &#039;thing&#039; could be various biological molecules. belonging to something science has no concept or reason to believe in. <br /><br /><br />Post trip. My science-orientated mind rationalised the majority of what I experienced. But for those few hours, I was the happiest. Free-est person I&#039;ve ever been. And where as before I would have pimp slapped you. I would now sit down, and listen, and ultimately keep an open mind.<br /><br />Now if only I could source some DMT.

I will never forget this experience until the day I die.<br /><br />To start ill give a little background. Im not a very spiritual person overall im not religiouse, im not a buddhist, I dont believe in magic etc. Well I was with this trini chick and she always told me that theres something special about her and that sometimes she&nbsp; sees spirits/demonds. This girl is also very religiouse and on top of that trini people are heavy into magic/voodo beliefs so I never really took what she said seriously....Well one day we decided to pop shrooms I ate 1/8 and she ate a couple grams. No big deal I wasnt expecting anything at all , I did the same exact shrooms a few days before and popped 7 gr had a good trip but nothing out of the ordinary.So we popped them and walked around a bit then came back to the building to go to my place, but I forgot my keys inside and everybody had left so we were stuck on the stairs. We decided to wait until someone returned and by this time I could feel the shrooms kicking in....she was sitting on the floor facing me and I was a couple stairs higher looking down at her. I cant remember when it started but I never did before and till this day never experienced anything like what came next...EVER <br /><br />I went into a trance and couldnt avert my stare from her eyes...they turned deep blue and I could see the ocean and stars like the milky way the colors were so beautiful I cant put it into words. Her forehead had a golden symbol on it with dots in a pattern around it and they all glowed in sequence, her brain was pushing the inside of her forehead and I could see her head bulging. Her skin looked like a lizard or snake with scales that where shinning all diffrent colours even some colours ive never seen before. There was this electricity in the air I heard a voice in my head talking to me&nbsp; I was terrified but it was so bueatiful and amazing I started crying. I saw visions of animals and places ive never been before, it told me &quot;your wrong&quot;...&quot;humanitys wrong&quot;...&quot;you only cause suffering&quot; ...&quot;the world is crying&quot;.<br /><br />There was more , it told me its name but I cant remember everything this happened more than 4 years ago. When I came out of the trance I was standing up and the girl was there just repeating my name...I was drenched in sweat and so exhausted I couldnt stand up and grabbed the rail and sat down. She told me I started mumbling and was shaking and crying just staring at her it seemed very long but was only a few minutes, I was COMPLETELY sober when it ended. She said she barely even felt the 2 g she took.<br /><br />To this day I dont know what that was God or a spirit but something communicated with me and used her as a means to do it...writing this brings back the same feeling I had and tears of joy to my eyes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Have you ever taken psychedelics?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Would it help? :-D<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Before acid I was the most un-spiritual person you could meet. People that hearing talk about it irritated me. But after feeling what I felt, it&#039;s changed my view. As a scientist I hold the viewpoint &#039;I won&#039;t believe it unless it can be proved, or I can experience it my self&#039; and expect you feel the same. <br /><br />Try LSD. I promise you that you will be amazed. If anything I think having a knowledge of science and being a critical thinker makes acid more interesting, because I&#039;m constantly reflecting over my trips and analysing things to a higher level than some might. I would love a research post involving psychedelics, not to take the supply, just to study more into it. Get some hard data.

				Personally I have never broken through on DMT before, but I&#039;ve had my world ROCKED by salvia, trumping any of my shroom/LSD/2c trips. I completely dissociated and had zero connection to the room I was in...<br /><br />When I was 16 I got stuck in Amsterdam Schiphol while traveling back to the USA with two friends due to a really stormy and harsh December and we basically had the choice to wait in a 15 hour line to get the next available plane, or we could get a hotel and sit around for two days and wait for the weather to clear and the airport to get people out. Needless to say, we chose to find a cheap hotel in the city center and adventure for two days. :P<br /><br />At one point during these two days we had picked up some 15X salvia extract and bought a small bong for while we were there. Having ordered some 40X online and ripped it out of a bong before, I was totally prepared for smoking it again- not. I have no idea why, but I tripped 1000 times harder off the 15X we bought in a smartshop, I guess you never really know how potent your salvia is from different producers. <br /><br />Anyway I completely cashed the bowl and my friend video taped my whole trip and as I was walking out of the bathroom where I hit the bong I exhaled because I couldn&#039;t hold it in any longer and I remember walking out the door and saying &quot;Get me outta here&quot; because the entire room warped like a spiral like you can do in photoshop. Then after my vision twisted and I was in the room looking at the camera my friend was holding, and my entire frame of vision literally ripped (zipped) apart. I distinctly remember seeing the outline of the camera and every other object unzip with a zipper like the one probably near your crotch right now. After this I could not see any part of the room I was in, I was shot in a 2-dimensional world, filled only with a flat wall of distorted colors. I remember thoughts racing through my head- I honestly believed that my entire life up to that point, my 2 friends, my family, EVERYTHING I had ever known, was complete bullshit. I knew I had just ripped salvia, but I was convinced that my place in the universe had been broken, something had gone seriously wrong, and I felt the presence of multiple higher intelligent entities around me, or the concept of me, whatever the hell &quot;I&quot; actually was. I thought that these beings were of some higher order or dimension and that it was their duty to keep order in the universe, and they were trying to fix what had gone wrong at my location. All of this was pretty overwhelming but not in a negative or positive way- it was more of a strange, neutral kind of experience. Eventually &quot;I&quot; came spiraling up this wall of 2-d colors and I was still pretty fucked up but was starting to come back to reality. I kept saying &quot;I&#039;m back, I&#039;m back&quot; to my friend who had been filming and I was laughing hysterically. All in all the experience actually lasted only 11 minutes but it felt so much longer. I watched the video of myself and I was basically a zombie, I couldn&#039;t really speak, just mumbled words like &quot;Whaaat?&quot; &quot;Whyy?&quot; I asked my friend, &quot;Are you doing this??? Who did this to me?&quot; although I have no memory of speaking or being in the room at all lol. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty agnostic when it comes to religion and things, and I don&#039;t believe that there&#039;s a single all-powerful being that governs the universe, but I do like to think all life is somehow spiritually connected on a deeper cosmic or inter-dimensional level that we are unaware of in our day to day lives. This experience really put me in my place for a while, as I was definitely not expecting to have my reality rocked so hard, especially considering I thought I had smoked 40X before. If I tripped that hard off of a 15X extract, that makes me wonder WTF would happen if I took the same rip of a legitimate 60X extract.... or who the hell knows, maybe the packet we bought had accidentally been mixed up with a stronger extract. Guess I&#039;ll never know.<br /><br />Phew.

				I had my most intense experience with my brother after he made me take far too much ketamine. At first the effects were pleasant but as the drugs took hold time began to apparently stutter and loop and then stretch out to an eternal present. I felt like I had melded with my brother and we were wrestling with some dark entity. It seemed like my normal life had been a brief illusion and this terrifying swirling maelstrom was the only reality. After a while I emerged from the k-hole. Our friend told us we had been wrestling with a bin bag on the floor with pitiful cries.<br />Make of my tale what you will

				Joywind, if you read the last line of my earlier post you&#039;ll see that I say exactly that! I guess you would say that means both are real whereas I would say neither are real.<br /><br />But as far as spiritual things not being amenable to scientific proof, this smacks of special pleading. Like the homeopaths who claim that double blind testing is not appropriate for their &#039;medicine&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#039;s just take out of body experiences. Many people claim to leave their bodies. If they can it should be easy enough to demonstrate. Let them read a hidden piece of paper on a floor above! There are plenty of anecdotes of people who claim to have done this. But this is all they are: anecdotes. There is a phrase: the plural of anecdote is not data. No one has performed this feat under controlled conditions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I personally can easily visualise what the world would look like from six feet above my body. There is no evidence that OOBE are anything more than vivid dreams.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sound philosophical reasoning can be used to support any position. It doesn&#039;t make that position true.<br />Take Descartes:<br />God is perfect. Existence is a perfection; anything that didn&#039;t exist would be less perfect than something that exists. Therefore God exists.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think we can all agree this lacks the punch of &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot;( I think therefore I am)<br /><br />Direct experience is the least reliabled form of evidence. If I over indulge in stimulants I may become convinced a black helicopter is pursuing me , but hopefully this is not the case.<br />Similarly if I take enough psychedelics I may believe I have slipped through the time membrane and the polyhedron creatures are laughingly explaining the relationship between gravity and time to what remains of my soul. In what we collectively agree to call reality I am just tripping hard.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong I believe psychedelics are truly amazing mind expanding substances.<br />I just don&#039;t believe in paranormal stuff. Most of it is so pedestrian and unimagiative. People return from death and spout banality? Aliens that suggest we are polluting the earth and shoud love one another ?<br />Tell us how to generate cheap energy you little patronising grey fuckers!

				&quot;Information has been obtained through the survival of consciousness after death which could not be obtained by the individual unless the mind can exist independently of the body. Of course, much of the evidence is anecdotal,&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If this were the case it would be a hugely important discovery; unfortunately like so many other phenomena when put to proper testing it cannot be demonstrated.<br /><br />&quot;One should not confuse﻿ one&#039;s own intellectual incuriousness with paucity of objective evidence.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;One should not confuse having arrived at a different philosophical position to oneself after many years of thought with intellectual incuriousness.

				Theres deffinately &quot;paranormal activity&quot; or a &quot;spiritual world&quot; and by those terms i mean a world that we dont yet understand....and by that i mean.... it could be actual spirits/entitys or just energy or just our brains working at a diffrent level/accessing a diffrent dimension etc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but its there.<br /><br />Ill give you another example of something that happened to me recently a few months ago. I wasnt on any drugs whatsoever nothing at all...I was over my friends place for a bbq and ended up sleeping there. That night in my dream I was in a hospital and people came up to me telling me that somebody had a stroke I cant remember exactly but I think it was my grandma that had the stroke. Well I woke up in the morning feeling stressed like I usually do after I have a fucked up dream...I told my gf about it but didnt think anything of it. Later that same day my friends dad calls from back home and tells us my friends aunt tried to commit suicide by drinking alcohol and swallowing all her perscription meds(not sure what they where) and she had a STROKE and almost died.<br /><br />If anyone can scientifically explain that to me id love to hear it because honestly things like this trip me out and id love to have a concrete explanation to it. I have never before dreamt about anyone having a stroke, I didnt watch any movies involving strokes, I didnt talk about strokes that day. I thought about pure coincidence but I find that theory harder to believe than religion :P
