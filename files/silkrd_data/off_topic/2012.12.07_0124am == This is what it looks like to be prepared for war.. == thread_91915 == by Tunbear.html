				..against the munchies!<br /><br />I recently started smoking weed again after a few few years off and for some reason I get the most INSANE case of the munchies, and I&#039;m usually left unsatisfied. I knew I was gonna smoke tonight so I stocked up, I also have microwave pizzas in the freezer ready to go, and ice cream :D<br /><br />I dunno what it is about weed nowadays but shit is just magic...food tastes epic. I had some stuff a few weeks ago that made me so super high that when I was sadded because I got the wrong ice cream, my brain actually tricked me into tasting it as the ice cream flavour I wanted.<br /><br />What munchies do y&#039;all go for ?

				So a summaryf of how bad my munchies gets..<br /><br />At 1:24 at the clock the post was posted.<br />I then started eating, and apart from&nbsp; 2 times to post on IRC how much I&#039;ve eaten, then instantly carrying on pushing food into my mouth like an etheopian at an all you can eat buffet.<br />The time is now 2:28<br /><br />That&#039;s just over an hour of just shovelling food into my mouth. Think on that for a second. When was the last time you ate just constantly for a solid hour and seven motherfucking minutes.<br /><br />Casualty list was s a snickers bar, 2 milky bars, one of those extra big chocolate orange bars...oh and 11 packets of crisps (chips for the US folks). And a bowl of ice cream. With 4 ice cream scoops.<br /><br />Bonus note: I sped up towards the end because I noticed how much food I was shovelling in, and got really excited, and then SPED UP MY EATING because i got super giddy to make this post.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...And I&#039;m still hungry...

				hahaha, I get the worst munchies too...<br /><br />But because I&#039;m too lazy(cheap) to buy my own food, I raid other people&#039;s fridges and pantries. <br /><br />Last night when I got high I went to a friend&#039;s and ate 2 bananas, 6 persimmons, 2 little chocolate bars, a liter of yoghurt and 4 grilled cheese sandwiches. <br /><br />And when I say &quot;ate&quot;, what I mean by that is just PUSH/SHOVE into my mouth. Later that night I felt like someone stabbed me in the gut, because in the amazement I forgot to chew some stuff, lol.<br /><br />Oh and also, don&#039;t know if this can go to this thread, but I&#039;ve really started tasting different cigarettes while being high, lol. <br />It&#039;s AMAZING, cigarettes really do have a taste(rather than that chemical one), mostly this musky, nutty taste, but it differs. <br />Menthols are the best, though.<br />Ugh am rambling again. lol<br /><br />~~sitamaja
