				Is it just really hard to come by, or is there just not enough demand for it for vendors to keep it in stock?

The effects are almost identical but just minus the bodyload with MOXY so really, when you ask yourself who really likes body load there wasn&#039;t much point in having both.

				interesting... heard that foxy was the best fuckdrug, but if moxy is also good then i may be interested :D<br /><br />what are the dosages like for Moxy? I only have a shittier scale that does two decimal places of grams, so if it&#039;s not too dose-sensitive i may grab some!

You could also weigh out 100mg and dissolve it in 1L of 5% alcohol solution (alcohol to kill bacteria) and drink 10mL of the solution for every milligram you want to take.
