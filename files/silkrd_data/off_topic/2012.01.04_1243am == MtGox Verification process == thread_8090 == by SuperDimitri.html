				So, they let me send money to my MtGox account, but then say it needs to be verified by my ID, or by my last bill. So,I tried to convert them back to usd and send to my Dwolla, THAT is also locked up. So, now I am sitting on BTC, but can&#039;t do shit with them. I saw some other posts about this, but they were are from a few months back. <br />Has anyone else ran across this problem recently? What happens if they decide not to verify my account? What happens to my money then? Lost forever? I didn&#039;t see any posts other than the griping over it. I&#039;m also griping, but I need some answers. <br />I was TOTALLY stoked not to have to pay a premium to get BTC on SR, and now I have no coin!<br />I also read that Tradehill doesn&#039;t send btc to SR btc addresses, is this true? Or even possible?<br />Thanks in advance!

				In my experience, Mt.Gox asks for ID when you connect to them using TOR.

				Seems like it! Never read any warnings otherwise. What&#039;s the point of anonymity, then?<br />

				If you&#039;re using BTC in your legitimate business, why would you need to connect to your Bitcoin exchange through TOR? The current implementation of Bitcoin isn&#039;t anonymous anyway, so I wouldn&#039;t worry about my account getting flagged. Be sure to tumble your coins a few times though.

				Actually, the whole tumbling thing is what caused this. It&#039;s now obvious I shouldn&#039;t have sent them to MtGox. Fuck, I am an idiot. I was dying to get some tasty nugs and get my seller account going. I invested a lot of time &amp; $$, and this stupid fucking mistake?!?!? Put on hold for an indefinite amount of time,or just totally stolen. <br />FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
