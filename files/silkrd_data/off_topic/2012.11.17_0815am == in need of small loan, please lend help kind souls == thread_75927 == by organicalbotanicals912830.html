				hey there, so about midday today I attempt to make an exchange with &quot;Cocezero&quot; after doing thorough research on the forums and through his feedback, everything looked legit so proceeded to attempt to exchange 700$ worth of moneypaks, The man decided he would profit off of my misfortune instead of sending me the bitcoins I deserved. It&#039;s going to be a rough recovery for this one, and i don&#039;t ever do this but I have no option other than to come to ask for help from other humans in order to get me back on my feet.<br /><br />what I am asking for is not unreasonable, In order to recover quickly from this I need around 30btc total, which would be paid back with an interest rate of 30%&nbsp; 14 days from loan date. I have no collateral to offer except a few kind words from others to vouch for my honesty and integrity. Also I have been a member here for over a year with 0% refund if that helps, my SR username is OrganicalBotanicals if you want to check stats.<br /><br />Loan Outline:<br />Type: Loan;Borrow<br />Amount: 1-30 BTC<br />Interest Rate: 30%<br />Payout Date: 14 Days from Borrow date<br />Total Payout: 39 BTC<br />Deposit Address: <br />1Fd65zSb6CDWzQ5cAcw75Lw5ueN9S7DdJk<br /><br />Anything and everything helps, Thank you for your kindness. Please message me after deposit and I will keep loan information data stored in a safe place. If you do decide to loan me some BTC, do know that I will BUST MY ASS to make things right with you within the two weeks.<br /><br />Thanks all, love and light<br />-OB<br /><br />(p.s. fuck everybody who profits off of other human&#039;s misfortune and sadness)

				SR is being DDOSed right now or I would check, thank you for whatever contribution you decided to make. You will be paid in full the moment I can afford to again. You did not ill-judge me as I will do everything in my power to reward your kindness. Thank you for re-instating a little bit of faith back in me for humanity as a whole, may your life emotionally and physically be filled with health, prosperity, and happiness<br /><br />-OB

				Hmm, I experience a connection reset almost every time I attempt to connect after maintenance. I can still get on no problem, but it takes a couple flushes before I can even get the server to respond. I just assumed that it was Direct Denial of Service because it was a very similar type of network behaviour, it&#039;s probably just an issue on my end though if it&#039;s working fine for you,<br /><br />Cheers<br />OB

				i just wrote sr to cancel my order from cocezero.&nbsp; i will not support someone who has scammed even one person.&nbsp; this is a shady game we play.&nbsp; but i for one,&nbsp; play with dignity, morality, and honesty.&nbsp; fuck with those things,&nbsp; i will play differently.&nbsp; eye for an eye.&nbsp; if you take $10 from someone, who is to say that $10 did not put food in a starving child&#039;s mouth?
