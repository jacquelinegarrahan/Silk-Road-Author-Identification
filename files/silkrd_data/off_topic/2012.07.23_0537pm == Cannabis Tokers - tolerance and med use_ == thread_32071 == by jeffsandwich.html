				Just curious on some of you fellow tokers of the great green herb.<br /><br />Do you pick up a gram or 2 at a time, an oz, or some real weight?<br />I don&#039;t like to hold &gt; 1 oz for legal reasons (why take more risk than necessary?) but getting anything less than a half seems like a waste and too much overhead compared to what it lasts for.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some of you guys resell, the Road has way better prices than my usual street guys (and often better bud) - but personally I don&#039;t have any interest in anything but personal use, fuck actually dealing with people :P&nbsp; Half the reason I love the Road is no having to deal with random sketchbag dealers.<br /><br />How long does an 1/8th end up lasting you?<br />Seems like a lot of you guys aren&#039;t into rolling papers, so I&#039;m sure it goes a lot further, and if you&#039;re getting medical grade but without a high tolerance, I&#039;m sure a small amount is knocking you on your ass.&nbsp; I like to roll a joint every couple days, I hate how much more weed it uses but for the same time span a joint gets me more in the zone.<br /><br />Any medical uses or just recreation?<br />It would be a total lie to say I don&#039;t enjoy just smoking bud, way more than alcohol (no hangover and drinking mass quantities..) but I found myself drawn back to weed after quitting for a few years because of the medicinal values.&nbsp; Stomach problems and headaches - cannabis works for me hands down much much better in 9/10 cases.&nbsp; It&#039;s about the only reason I sleep through the nights these days (which makes being out more excruciating) and I can totally say my overall quality of day to day life is much better because of it.&nbsp; Not to mention stress... no matter how bad it is, a bowl or two helps clear your head and lets you focus on the important things.<br /><br />That&#039;s just my take on it, I&#039;ve toked some of the best buds around the country and have quite a tolerance, so always looking for quality buds.&nbsp; A lot of feedback I read on vendor&#039;s profiles looks like there are quite a few more novice smokers, so reading &quot;great bud!&quot; isn&#039;t always an accurate response.<br />A buddy of mine just started smoking, been getting dirt 4g for 40, I dropped him off a couple of the WORST buds I&#039;ve gotten on the Road and he was torched. For him, that bud was a 10/10, but realistically it was more like a 6.&nbsp; Subjectivity :P&nbsp; Just curious how many of you out there are true connoisseurs and really appreciate the variance in the buds, or just like smoking buds and still able to get baked on any kind of leafy herb ;)

				I&#039;m not currently capable of this, financially, but my friend is.<br /><br />I prefer to have 1-2 oz of my favorite day to day strains, 1/4-1/2 oz of a few others I enjoy. I smoke throughout the day, varying between 2 and 8 bowls a day unless I go &quot;nuts&quot; and smoke 6-12 bowls in a row, progressing from cannabis to hash to budder.<br /><br />I smoke for various reasons medical and recreational. It keeps me from getting apathetic and depressed for any reason my mind can fabricate. It keeps me from getting angry at those close to me for things I imagine them saying or doing (I don&#039;t mean delusions I mean I imagine conversations and I sometimes can&#039;t help imagining my friends saying things they never would and I get pissed about it anyway). It keeps me from getting flashes of committing violent acts, flashes that assault all of my senses.<br /><br />I also really enjoy it in general, and it&#039;s wonderful for my creativity. It also often helps with social anxiety (at least the strains I like, some make me more anxious).<br /><br />Regarding the effect on stress in general, when I was in school my grades started climbing at an accelerated pace when I started smoking, as I was no longer too stressed to do homework. I was also more motivated to do chores around the house, improving my relationship with my parents. Cannabis did wonders for my relationship with my parents, until they found out I was smoking it. (Stuff with them is fixed now but I have to let my dad think I&#039;m Mr. Sobriety)

				i personally prefer 1/4s or more...but i am noticing that buying a gram here is usually a good idea before you get a lot. i have been somewhat burned by buying the larger amounts on here, only to have the product not live up to the hype of the listing. like you said, what&#039;s good to most isn&#039;t all that great to me. now i am switching to &#039;better safe than sorry&#039; mode for the larger transactions now, so buying a gram will be less disappointing if i dont like it vs buying a 1/4 with the same results. i love variety as well, so it&#039;s nothing for me to have 3 or 4 different strains of meds at one time. the better quality of medicine, the less i have to use...

				I use MMJ mainly for depression, it&#039;s kept me motivated through college, and now law school. I occasionally take a tolerance break, but I probably use about .5g a day. Although I will have those once-in-a-blue-moon weekends where I go through a OZ lol.

To be crystal, I smoke clear-headed, uppy sativas. Like Citrus Haze or Strawberry Cough (lately). We also currently have a stock of heavily narcotic L.A. Confidential that&#039;s a one (bowl) and done. It&#039;s all about what strain you smoke, and mindset.

				I am lucky enough to live in a country where amounts for personal possession is not illegal. So that doesn&#039;t worry me.<br /><br />Generally I use it instead of alcohol after stressful days. I have a bit of lower spine arthritis so it helps with the pain. I actually like having a bowl before I go to yoga class. Gets me in the zone and helps me stretch the lower back and keep it mobile. <br /><br />My only issue is that getting a wide selection of strains like they do in California would be great. I could target something for arthritis pain with less of a stoned feeling so I can still work with out many problems.<br /><br /><br />

				Weed with high CBD&#039;s is generally the most medicinal, although outside of dispensaries it&#039;s hard to find the CBD content of your buds. In general, I recommend a nice, heavy Indica, or a euphoric Sativa for daytime. For me, purple strains have been immensely helpful in dealing with pain and headaches, although they can be quite sedating at times. For pain before work in the daytime I usually go for a Sativa such as Sour Diesel or Kali Mist.
