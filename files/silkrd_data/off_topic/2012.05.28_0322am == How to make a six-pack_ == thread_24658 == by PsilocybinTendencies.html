				I&#039;ve never got to sport a six pack before. I think I&#039;d like to.<br /><br />I just got done doing crunches and leg lifts. Not that many, but I haven&#039;t exercised in a while. Did a couple pushups too for good measure.<br /><br />I was thinking I could do this every night, and slowly increase the number I can do.<br /><br />I might also combine this with one of those weight loss offerings to maybe shave off a touch of that baby fat (so the muscle I&#039;m trying to build is visible).<br /><br />Without use of steroids, is there anything you guys might add to this plan? I know I should eat more healthy, but that&#039;s difficult for me.

				lol if you are eating shitty food thats not good for you you won&#039;t get fit properly..<br /><br /><br />you basically need to change how/when/what you eat. Starting with a healthy diet, then slowly eating throughout the day, rather than just having 2 or 3 large meals, keep slowly eating, have like 8 meals a day. Thats 8 small meals, not&nbsp; 8 HUGE meals, have some breakfast, instead of waiting 4-5 hrs then heating lunch eat every couple hours a small portion, the key is to never be super hungry, or super full just a good median. <br /><br />then with that excersise is key, get on some fitness forums and read and learn! I have found a lot of those forums are full of people with information that are super willing to help out.<br /><br />If you can afford it hire a personal trainer for a bit, or atleast until you get a good routine going, then hire one again once you start to plateau

				Diet is a huge part of achieving a six-pack.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Increasing the number of reps you can do is a good idea.&nbsp; (If you&#039;re as nerdy as I am, you can put it into an excel spread sheet to see a graph of your progress as you go&nbsp; ;) )&nbsp; You mentioned that you wanted to lose a bit of fat, I&#039;d probably recommend a bit of cardio as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;d like you can PM me and I can give you more help.&nbsp; I&#039;m going for my master&#039;s in exercise physiology in a year, so I can try to answer any questions you have or write you up a training plan if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Getting a six pack has very little to do with exercising your abdominal muscles with crunches etc and a LOT to do with changing your body composition.&nbsp; That means eating well.&nbsp; Diet will be about 90% of your effort.&nbsp; In order to have visible abs you need to have your body fat % under 15% and more likely around 12% but this depends on your body and personal genetics.&nbsp; You need to check your BF% to know where you are at.&nbsp; Then just look online for information on lowering BF.&nbsp; Since having a low bodyfat % is a priority for body builders then some of your best information will come from &quot;competition prep&quot; diets and workout plans.&nbsp; But just a heads up a lot of those plans are designed for people that are taking steroids and other drugs.<br /><br />That&#039;s about all I can fit here.&nbsp; Do some research but what you&#039;re trying to do is lower your body fat.&nbsp; If you try to look up how to get a six pack you&#039;re going to get a lot of bullshit marketing.

				Everyone here is giving you great advice, also we don&#039;t know your starting point or how far a way from a six pack you are. One secret I will tell you(not really a secret) that will make things a lot easier, DON&#039;T EAT PROCESSED FOODS. Nothing from a bag, box, or can. Except whole grains(oatmeal,brown rice, wheat berries etc.) Eat lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and fresh lean sources of protein like fish, chicken breast, egg whites, lean cuts of beef. And a mixture of strength training and cardio 3-5 days a week. We could sit here and give you advice all day but you need to evaluate your goals and educate yourself on proper nutrition and exercise. It can be done, I&#039;ve lost 45 pounds and lowered my body fat from 36% to 14% but it takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. Hope this helps and like someone else said if you need more advice you can pm me and I&#039;d be more than happy to try and answer your questions especially about nutrition because it&#039;s a true passion of mine especially since I&#039;m a chef, I cook everyday of my life I went to school for nutrition science and I have two small children I&#039;m trying to keep on a healthy diet. So feel free to ask. Good luck!!!

				Wow thanks for all the great input guys.<br /><br />I think my inability to eat right is going to make this endeavor fail. My employment always feeds me junk. And I live with someone who can&#039;t make herself stop putting together yummy desserts. <br /><br />That would be a difficult habit to change for me. As for a starting point, I would only need to lose a little bit of fat and build some muscle to make it happen, I am not too far off at all. I am a pretty active person in general and I find excuses to get exercise, I&#039;ve just never been able to shave that little bit extra off and get cut, most likely because of my diet.

				Well people seem to have summed it up here but il throw in my .02 BTC.<br /><br />The key to a six pack is low body fat. Thats why really skinny people have six packs, if there is no fat to go over the muscle then your gonna be able to see the muscle. I think it would be a little lower than 12% body fat to get a good definition on your abs, maybe 8%. <br /><br />As for exercise then crunches are the best for abs, i would combine them with some planks, side planks, leg raises, bicycle crunches to get a good abs and obliques. However in terms of crunches i think i would aim to be able to do 4 (maybe) sets of 20 to 25 a day with about 90 seconds rest between them. Once you are able to do that i would think about holding books behind your hear or to your chest (depending on method) or just anything to weigh you down. Building muscle size is achieved best not through 1000&#039;s of reps but through heavy reps, i think 25 is plenty to be managing in a set and 4/5 sets is plenty to be doing.<br /><br />As far as the diet goes low fat and low carbs are probably the best way to go as far as weight loss goes. I would suggest that you probably increase you protein intake, whey supplements are the easiest way to do this, if you can afford it go for the impact whey as it has less kcal etc. As was said previously its about eating a few small meals rather than 3 big ones. The reason is that every time you eat you bodys metabolism kicks in which means it starts burning energy, so by eating more times a day you keep it going for a longer period of time. 6 meals a day would be fine and a protein shake can be counted as a meal (pretty sure thats right). Try to avoid carbs from say 6pm onwards, the reason being is they are the bodys immediate store of energy, if you eat them late and then don&#039;t use them they get converted into fat for storage.<br /><br />30-60mins cardio as many times as possible (up to 7) a week would be a great start to loosing the body fat. Try doing interval training as well which works on the principle you use 90% effort for 4 mins, 50% effort for 3 mins, 90% for 4 mins, 50% for 2mins or something like that. The point is you keep switching between moderate and intense. People seem to report better losses this way.<br /><br />As for working out your abs i think the regularity depends on how much you are doing. If you did every exercise i listed for 3 sets, i don&#039;t think you could do them daily, they would probably take too long and im not sure they would have time to recover properly (if you over work them then you will just pull/strain/tear something and this will stop you doing most exercise, you wont get a six pack that way!). So il suggest two programs;<br /><br />Daily;<br />3-4 sets of 20-25 crunches (key to a good crunch is not to bend your neck)<br />x3 1-2min planks<br />3 sets of 20-25 leg raises<br />Now this is only really working on your abs , once you get a decent show you mite want to start putting in exercises to work your obliques to give you some side definition.<br /><br />Now this routine i think would work 3 (maybe 4) times a week, say Monday, Wednesday, Friday;<br />4-5 sets of 20-25 crunches<br />4 sets of 20-25 bicycle crunches<br />x3 1-2min planks<br />x3 per side 1-2min side planks<br />4 sets 20-25 leg raises<br />This doesn&#039;t seem like much more but i think if your are doing them to failure (when trying to build muscle always push to failure) you will find that pretty exhausting, and should have a noticeable DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) the next day. Just to clarify in my opinion you would be far better off only managing to do 16 crunches on your last set because you had some weights on you can couldn&#039;t push any more, than doing 25 on your last set and feeling fine. If you are hitting 25, you need to add some weight.<br /><br />As for protein consumption, bodybuilders work on 1g per pound of weight i think. I think that is probably a little excessive but if you can hit 1g maybe 1.5g per kg that should be fine, you are not a competition body builder after all!<br /><br />Just to add this work out is based solely around abs. If it was part of a balanced work out i would either stick to just doing the daily routine, or doing the other routine as twice a week in combination with one of the major muscle groups (probably make most sense to do with Back as both constitute part of your &#039;core&#039; muscle group).<br /><br />A great great website for free, no bullshit, home work out advice for both weight loss and muscle building is scoobysworkshop.com i admit the guy is a little weird, and his videos may seem a little silly. But the guy knows his stuff, and baring in mind he is 50 he is in amazing shape. I have always found his website informative and pretty damn inspirational =)<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />

Hate it even more when he says shit like how lucky I am to have this and that. Dude lives my dream, video games, Doritos and weed to fill in the time between the hot booty call brunette from last night wakes up and leaves and the super hot with mental problems blonde that pays for all his drinks fucks his brains out tonight. I can live on that quite happily.
