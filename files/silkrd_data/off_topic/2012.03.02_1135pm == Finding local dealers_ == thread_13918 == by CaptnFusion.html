				This is a slightly broad question but I have a direct reason. I deal weed locally, I pick up an ounce and flip it in like 4 days. Ounces are boring though and I want to buy bigger. Any suggestions on where or how to find someone who deals half pounds or more?<br /><br />In addition, What about finding dealers for other drags? Any tips on that?

				Not really...much like in the business world..it&#039;s not what you know it&#039;s who you know.<br /><br />Just have to keep &quot;networking&quot; and meeting up with other smokers, ask where other people get their stuff from e.t.c<br /><br />obviously watchout for crackheads, &quot;too-good-to-be-true&quot; offers and potential robberies and you should be ok.<br /><br />but it does take YEARS to build up connections, which is why most people hold on to them so hard (and of course for business reasons = protecting their own investments)

				funny story, my friend used to move stuff for this middleweight gangster back in the day, when they first started business and agreed terms they were sitting at the guys house with him, the gangster and a big enormous black guy, the gangster gave him 2 numbers, 1 for product and 1 for muscle (pointed at the big black guy). got to the point where he would buy now pay later with the guy, then one day my friend went to pick up a large piece and as he was leaving he walked around the corner and was held up for his shit (i dont believe in coincidences) anyway the dealer beat him up and made him hunt around for money to pay him asap on threat of death (the awkward moment he told his dealer about the robbery he was held by 5 knife wielding scumbags) and this guy wasnt working so coming up with the money broke him for the year, and after being threatened with knives and guns for real, he was never the same again. actually wait that wasnt a funny story, it was actually fucking hideous. <br /><br /><br />anyway have fun dealing

				shit happens when you deal with retards, <br /><br />Keep your clientele to people you trust and dont put yourself in situations like that, there are people who make Millions of dollars in this business some more relentless than others but none the less there are the legit few and the reason they get away with it is because they use their head<br /><br />Best of luck,

				There are a lot of different types of dealers. I recommend you are discerning on who you work with. Best advice really. If money is your end, it will end you. Focus on quality, friendliness, and never ever front. Professionalism goes a long way.<br /><br />~Digi

				Glass Jars hold many advantages -&gt;<br />Plastic on a whole, generally &quot;grabs&quot; at trichomes, and makes it quite easier to break open the capitate stalked trichomes (the mature, and overall main constituent of high quality cannabis), which leads to the degradation of THC into CBN. (Also why all you people sending weed need an air bubble! ). Glass Jars can be used to further cure the weed and avoid molding, by jar curing as normal (open jars for about 30 minutes in a well ventilated / slightly windy area that is dark and dry. Closet with small fan works well. Then close the jar and let sit another 6 - 12 hours depending on the cure needed. Remember once harvested UV light will contribute to degradation of THC as well. Once cured, airtight is a must to avoid further breakdown. Amber glass jars are the best as they block UV light.<br /><br />Curing weed is essential, it helps convert THC-A to THC. Important! <br /><br />~Digi

				As for the poster who tried to scare me out of it, I only deal with people I know for the most part, and I never borrow money from a dealer. As for everyone thanks for all the good feedback, people on this forum are just great! And yea I already tend to use glass jars to hold my bud. As for the person saying 4 days isn&#039;t fast, consider that I&#039;m dealing dimes and only to people I know. Think about 70 dimes in an ounce. If I pick up a half pound and deal in half O&#039;s and O&#039;s that&#039;s only 8-16 segments to push which can be done faster with a network of dealers.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m buying my ounces from a dealer that used to deal small years ago but is doing weight now. He charges me more per the ounce then my other guy but my other guy is out of state so I can only pick up from him so often. I think I&#039;ll deal with the extra cost and build up a longer trust so I can meet who he gets his big weight from.

				There&#039;s a lot of good advice on this thread.&nbsp; I&#039;d just like to add my 0.1BTC:<br /><br />Patience is often the name of the game.&nbsp; You might find someone willing to sell you bulk for reasonable prices, but always be wary of &quot;good deals,&quot; and be smart about it.&nbsp; As Reseller mentioned above, use your intuition.&nbsp; Do your best to play the waiting game and find someone you consider trustworthy.&nbsp; Your name and face will be attached to these transactions, so you want to do your very best to make sure you are safe.&nbsp; Good luck!

				Get well known for good products, get into the right circle of friends that can introduce you to new dealers but you really need to gain respect and trust before the right people approach you, the rave scene is a good one to get into if you can will get to know alot of people involved with things like that.

				If you&#039;re around a college, look for the fraternity dudes and convince them you&#039;re going to be moving weight. I took the initiative in getting my connect. Used to get middlemanned all the time by this chico i went to middle school with. once dude realized i was pushing about 5 lbs a week, he started talking to me a little at the deals and i could tell he was interested. so i put my number on a piece of paper and discreetly slipped it into his hand. been steady fuckin with this guy for over a year, and it&#039;s got me hella paid. guy i stepped around wanted to rob me for awhile though, never could figure out my moves though ;)
