				He wants you to finalize early, this will put you completely out of escrow and you should only do this on trusted sellers, with good feedback both on here and on their vendor page.<br />After a few purchases you will no longer be asked to do this. This is to stop scammers claiming they didn&#039;t receive their package, but can be used in reverse, as they can pritty much get away with not sending you the parcel.<br /><br />Welcome to Silk Road,<br />Locker.
