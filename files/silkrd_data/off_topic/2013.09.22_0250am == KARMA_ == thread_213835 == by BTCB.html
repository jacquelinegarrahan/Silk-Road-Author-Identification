				Karma is treating others as you wish to be treated by others basicly, I include animals into that to and I dont eat meats or dairy bc of it.. For the animals but also for me since I know its the cause of cancer in humans since we are designed as herbavores and tricked intot hinking we are omnivores.<br /><br />When it comes to karma on this forum its kinda silly if you ask me, since people and specially vendors will probably &quot;act nice&quot; and use nicesounding words just to kiss ass on costumers, just so they dont get negative karma hahahahaa<br /><br />But saying what others dont wanna hear is what makes them grow and i think some vendors could have used some uglier words and have some opinions instead of caring about getting good karma..<br /><br />The karma on this forum is basicly there to make people shut the fuk up or get bad karma hahahaa but its still a forum for anonymous users so its kinda ridiculus to give karma to anonymous users depending on what they wrote.<br /><br />If I was a vendor that had alot of opinions that many could not handle but would grow if they knew about, then the karma could be negative to have.<br /><br />I cant really find something posetive that the karma in the forum do.<br /><br />But in rea life tho karma is a universal law, it can take some time but all krma has to be payed back so if you did to others things you dont want others t do to you, then get eady to pay that back unless you admits your mistakes and detach from doing them again. People think karma dont exists because it takes time to pay back the karma sometimes.<br /><br />In higher dimensions there is no time and karma comes back instantly and there is nobody going to higher dimensions unless you understand karma in this lowest dimension.
