				Look, the newbs are getting confused, it&#039;s perfectly legal to come here on the forums, its just when you buy drugs its not. So don&#039;t ever link your forum account with your SR account, and you&#039;ll be fine.

Why not create new ones and let your trusted vendors know its you through encrypted messages? <br /><br />You can never be too safe when conspiring to traffic narcotics through the hands of federal employees on the internet, deep web or not(especially not, that would be fucking idiotic. lol) imo.
