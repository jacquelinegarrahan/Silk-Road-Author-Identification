				Not to be racist or anything, but it seems so much easier with foreign chicas. Am I daydreaming, or is it easier by a mile?

				When you say foreign chicks who are you aiming that towards?? If you live in America girls from UK are going to be foreign chicks vice versa. I am assuming you mean ladies of color?<br /><br />PS: Whenever anyone starts a sentence with not being racist BUT.....you usually are being racist.

				I don&#039;t know if racist would be the word,, but maybe allergic to my own area haha. I guess the Anglosphere in general (NZ, Australia, UK, US, Western Europe to a lesser extent). (BTW, I am white , so would I be reverse racist? IDK)

				You cant really answer that accurately, because every country has their idiots, sluts etc. But definitely see differences in them though.<br />I like Europeans ;) Its all about how they grew up, culture, socialization and their surroundings and how many aspects of yourself you have In common.<br /><br />Soooooo it depends on YOU and HER ultimately.

				Well if I had to chose a country for me it would be Swedish girls without a doubt. I went to Stockholm in November to see Swedish House Mafia and the girls are all stunning and very friendly, in the UK where I live the girls are so rude.

				From the little I have seen (mostly online, so may cloud it), but I have gotten along well with girls from Asia and S. America. Why do you think this is? Anglo values? Or something else?

				You are absolutely CORRECT, sir.<br /><br />I&#039;m a white american man who moved to Southeast Asia, and the women here are fucking amazing.<br /><br />Hot, submissive, sexy, beautiful, and make awesome wives.<br /><br />Take a trip to Thailand or Cambodia, and meet the local women here. You won&#039;t ever want to talk to an American/western woman ever again.<br /><br />Asian women are the best!

What, and American women AREN&#039;T? Hell, in America, if you aren&#039;t a rich doctor or lawyer or CEO or whatever, and don&#039;t look like Brad Pitt, you might as well forget about getting a hot woman.<br /><br />American women are the BIGGEST gold-diggers.<br /><br />All women care about money, but Asian women are not as obsessed with money as western women are. Asian women are much more faithful than American/western women. That&#039;s why the divorce rate between Asian women and American/white men is only 20 percent, while the divorce rate between white American men and white American women is 60 percent.<br /><br />Obviously, the problem is American women.

				In High School there was this foreign exchange student from Germany. Very beautiful. I swooned her with my German 1 speaking level haha. I think it&#039;s really interesting having sex with foreigners, the language barrier was funny to work around too.

				Im an average white caucasian male, from England. I think the two countries where i got most attention from the fairer sex is USA and Thialand. In Thailand there are so many girls and when they see a white guy who is in his mid 20s average build they go mad for it. American girls are easy as soon as they hear you are english they will be all over you and the conversation will be very simple they ask you to say normal words like &#039;water bottle&#039; which for some reason they find hilarious.

				You haven&#039;t experienced a deep and meaningful relationship until you go out with a European. <br /><br />US girls are too artificial and fucking nuts.<br /><br />I would definitely include South America for the sex, I don&#039;t know about relationships there though. Fuck the racist who ranted about SA girls valuing only money. You wouldn&#039;t have a chance with a SA girl anyway with your pompous American accent you cunt.
