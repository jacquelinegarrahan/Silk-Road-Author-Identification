				Hi guys, <br />First of all I would like to say thank you to all the potential contributors. Now let me explain why I am posting this as a separate thread and not in the spare coins thread. Basically the reason is that I will not be able to give coins back in the near future as I have hit some financial hardship recently, and have really been struggling, however once I sort my self out, which could be a few good months I promise that I will pay back every single person who donated.<br />Now as to actual donations, I will have my birthday soon, and would really like to order some stuff of SR, but as mentioned above, I cant really afford it at the moment. My goal amount that I would like to collect is 1.80 BTC, therefore any donation, however big or small would be very much appreciated. Please forgive me if this begging is a bit inappropriate, especially that I am relatively new on here, but I am really desperate. However I do believe in the Brotherhood of the SR users, as well as Your generosity and understanding, as well as Karma. <br /><br />My username to donate to is: Meloniasty<br /><br />Once donated, please write down how much you have donated, so I can get back to You in the future and pay back (I will pay back the exact ammount of bitcoins donated, regardless of their value, unless you request differently)<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Meloniasty<br />&nbsp;

				While I&#039;m sympathetic to your financial trouble, you&#039;re asking for $200+ so you can have drugs on your birthday. I happily lend coin in the spare coin thread, but this is a bit much from a 12 day member to the forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are times I would love to make a large order, but for whatever reason I don&#039;t have extra cash, so you know what happens, I don&#039;t.<br /><br />Don&#039;t take advantage of peoples generosity.

				I got an easy method if you devote some time onto it, You are going to be most likely sitting on your butt applying for jobs 24/7 till you get a call for an interview. So while you&#039;re doing that might as well make 10$ each 2-3 hours.&nbsp; http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=566863&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to use my reff link but I&#039;d appreciate it.<br /><br /><br />This is how it works, you hear a song for 90 seconds , write at least a 2 paragraph review, rate it from 1-10 and click submit. Each review will get you at least 10 cents. If you review has some good grammar than it will be 18-25 cents each. You can literally write nonsense and bullshit on each review. Heck I even write almost the same review over and over again. I even put &#039;&#039;awesome guitar riffs&#039;&#039; on rap songs that don&#039;t have any guitars lol. Within 2-3 hours you&#039;ll make 10$. You can also just mute your browser and write random stuff as I do sometimes. Once you want to withdraw the money it sends it to your paypal. (Must have paypal it won&#039;t allow you to cash out) within 1-5 business days you will get the money into your paypal. It&#039;s legit and works I was a bit skeptical at first but it&#039;s all very fine. With this money you can send your self a check to your home and than from there do whatever method you do to get BTC.&nbsp; It is very little for 3 hours of writing paragraphs but if your sitting waiting and applying for jobs might as well. <br /><br />-note-(I suggest using the &#039;&#039;TORCH&#039;&#039; browser,as the website has a &#039;&#039;energy bar&#039;&#039; and each song you review it depletes a bit allowing you to do about only 12 songs every something mins. Now since &#039;&#039;TORCH&quot; is such a crappy browser it somehow glitches or freezes the energy bars from time to time, allowing you to do as much reviews as you want&nbsp; 8) ) <br /><br />I hope this helps you acquiring some money so you can at least order some goodies for your self. I personally ended up buying some earrings on ebay because the girl in me took over. But yeah, good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;
