				It&#039;s time to shed some light on some of the GOOD things the Road has done for it&#039;s members.&nbsp; Personally, as some of you know, a cut of Teachers from our friendly neighborhood mycologist ;) Rocker literally saved my sanity and my life.<br /><br />Having access to rare or hard to find psychedelics and the like (MDMA, etc) can really benefit people in a fugue and depressed state.&nbsp; Let alone the clinical evidence that backs these sorts of substances up, let&#039;s give the media something GOOD to bitch their tits off about.&nbsp; Let&#039;s plant a little seed in the minds of the proverbial &quot;naysayer&quot; and people currently against the Road, what it does and what it stands for.<br /><br />So post it up people!&nbsp; Let the world know how anonymous access to illegal and controlled substances has made a positive influence in your life!<br /><br />-<br />Take care all and don&#039;t forget:<br />Turn on. Tune in. Drop out.<br />J<br /><br />

				Lets see I&#039;ve lost about 35 pounds since joining SR ( thanks to some meth and speed usage,heh), Ive been exercising more, talking to friends more, having more sex (fuck buddies and drugs go together like peanut butter and jelly),Dancing more thanks to mdma, and just enjoying more in general. Yeah SR rocks, the drugs rock, and the forums are fun too!<br /><br />And I love a good positive thread in which to share. You know I think we drug users&nbsp; often get the bad rap that we somehow use drugs to escape or run from a bad life, but I think we can use them to enhance and enjoy. And I think thats what SR is really for, turning the negatives of drug use into positives. Heck, lets face it even people who are like CEOs and Rich cats in mansions, who have the &#039;perfect life&#039;, they let off steam and do hookers and blow and stuff. Drugs ain&#039;t just for &#039;losers&#039;. And SR helps make drugs more accessible to everyone and thats great.

				SR has given me and my husband back 20 years. Literally.&nbsp; I suspect that there are many on SR just like us who grow up and simply lose contact with anyone that could supply us with anything. I&#039;ve talked about it with close friends and they were just as at a loss as we were on how to find anyone or approach anyone else to find simple things like pot or shrooms. I had grown some shrooms a few years ago for our own use and it was a modest success but a lot of work and we had a child in the intervening years so we basically stopped all production in the house in the run up to me getting pregnant.<br /><br />Finding SR has enabled my husband and I to have enriched experiences together that we would not be able to have given our current lifestyle in a safe and meaningful way. I am in a comfortable job with no drug testing and this enables us to partake of pot that was unavailable 20 years ago. I find pot more stress relieving than any pill prescribed by any doctor.&nbsp; We&#039;ve now had 3 mushroom trips in just as many months (literally going away on a long weekend without the child and tripping on shrooms) and each of these experiences has brought us closer as a couple then we have felt in years. In short - SR has enabled us to live the life we WANT to live not the life we HAVE to live due to prohibition.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even been able to share some of my new booty with my close friends who otherwise had been at a loss. Now they are happy and content as well.<br /><br />Thank you to my vendors for being so discreet and having competitive pricing as well as good reviews both on SR and the boards.<br /><br />

Taking mind altering substances is satanic and wrong, unless the person who gave them to you is wearing a white coat. Then it&#039;s totally fine.<br /><br />Sometimes it just makes me sick knowing what kind of people live on the same street as me..

Some drugs are simply fun, others are unique experiences that enrich our lives in their own right. Many of us have medical problems and are unable to obtain their medicine in their respective states. Others cannot afford to see a psychiatrist month after month and thus turn to the underground to get their SSRI.<br /><br />And lets not forget that my life is a hell of a lot more fun now that I&#039;ve discovered the silk road! I work and go to school during the week, but after I&#039;ve finished for the day and on the weekends, I like to get high. Some people watch TV (I think it&#039;s bad for you, so I don&#039;t own one), some people eat (me, I try to stay healthy), some people unwind with a glass of wine, others go hiking or garden or work on their car. I get a little stoned during the weekday (also helps me sleep) and on the weekends I take MXE or do shrooms. Fun, relatively safe, and enjoyable. It&#039;s simply the hobby I&#039;ve chosen in life. So let me just enjoy my well-earned buzz after a hard day&#039;s work.<br /><br />tl;dr drugs are fun, enriching, mentally-stimulating and novel. I use them medicinally for depression, as part of therapy, and to help me sleep. Leave us alone, man.

				I&#039;ve only been here for a short time so I haven&#039;t really had time to walk down The Road properly yet. HOWEVER, I do think this place is brilliant, it gives those who decided to take careers in the exotic procurement business a chance to sell safely, network with other like minded individuals and meet a lot of interesting people in general on the forum. I for one am having a lot of fun already and I&#039;ve only just started. I see SR as a platform to do things the RIGHT way and really it&#039;s a very progressive entity. It makes me happy to see the amount of innovation, thought and dedication that people have to create this place and keep it going.<br /><br />All in all, long live The Road. :)<br /><br />

				There are a number of scheduled drugs which have no evidence in thier disfavor to show that they&#039;re harmful. Instead, the only criteria the DEA made was that they got you high - that&#039;s the real problem with drugs. It&#039;s enjoyable. But many of us are getting very useful experience from these products. But the DEA will only let us use drugs that aren&#039;t fun, like SSRIs. They call having fun &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;abuse potential&quot; is merely recreational potential, not a measre of ill health these drugs will inflict upon you.

				The Silk Road has done nothing but good for me. I do the following drugs: marijuana, MDMA, LSD, and mushrooms. Each of these drugs has actually made my life better, and made me happier without causing me to form a dependence. I was depressed for a long time. I actually saw a counselor for a good half a year. They tried to prescribe me something. It didn&#039;t help. Then I tried MDMA that I bought on the Road. It was a breathtaking experience, and from then on I was always happier. I ended up trying mushrooms and LSD, both of which I also got from the road. Both were amazing experiences and opened my mind greatly. I am now happier than ever. I don&#039;t do drugs very often, but I do use the Silk Road occasionally to get what I need and have a good time. It gives me something to look forward to. Also, I credit MDMA with saving my current relationship. Me and my girlfriend used it for our own couple&#039;s therapy, and it was tremendously helpful.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine my life without the Silk Road. It just offers me great times with safety that you can&#039;t get anywhere else. What the media fails to pick up on is that this is a safe alternative to dealing with sketchy dealers that might be selling you fake shit. On the Silk Road, everything is regulated by the members, so the scammers are ousted quickly. The quality is top notch because of the competition. Members actually test the drugs and post results to ensure safety and potency. It&#039;s a freaking paradise honestly. All this talk of child porn and that sort of thing? Well those bad things don&#039;t exist on the Silk Road. It is a place for people like myself to choose what we put into our bodies, and do it in the safest, cheapest way possible. So please stop reporting on child porn here, because that horrible smut exists on other parts of the Deep Web. Here, it would never be tolerated.<br /><br />I love the Silk Road. It&#039;s changed my life. I&#039;m happier than ever before, and I&#039;m never looking back. My depression is totally gone. My relationship is in a better state. I find myself looking forward to life instead of dreading it, all because of the Silk Road. I hope that some media sources read this post and understand that this site is truly amazing. Any attempts to take it down would hurt me personally, and countless others. Many of us have been personally touched by the experiences here, and the professionalism and friendliness of the best sellers matches no dealer I have ever met. Plus the administrator is an awesome guy that actually listens to our feedback and proves it in his changes. Everyone I know that does psychedelics is the coolest person, and we really love humanity and expect great things of it. The drugs I do open my mind in new and exciting ways, and I&#039;m always safe. The Silk Road allows me to have the peace of mind that I won&#039;t buy something that&#039;s going to kill me, or not work. <br /><br />So thank you Silk Road. I&#039;m sure I speak for hundreds of people when I say that my life would be worse without you.<br /><br />-DC

I do the following drugs: marijuana, MDMA, LSD, and mushrooms. Each of these drugs has actually made my life better, and made me happier without causing me to form a dependence. I was depressed for a long time. I actually saw a counselor for a good half a year. They tried to prescribe me something. It didn&#039;t help. Then I tried MDMA that I bought on the Road. It was a breathtaking experience, and from then on I was always happier. I ended up trying mushrooms and LSD, both of which I also got from the road. Both were amazing experiences and opened my mind greatly. I am now happier than ever. I don&#039;t do drugs very often, but I do use the Silk Road occasionally to get what I need and have a good time. It gives me something to look forward to. Also, I credit MDMA with saving my current relationship. Me and my girlfriend used it for our own couple&#039;s therapy, and it was tremendously helpful.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine my life without the Silk Road. It just offers me great times with safety that you can&#039;t get anywhere else. What the media fails to pick up on is that this is a safe alternative to dealing with sketchy dealers that might be selling you fake shit. On the Silk Road, everything is regulated by the members, so the scammers are ousted quickly. The quality is top notch because of the competition. Members actually test the drugs and post results to ensure safety and potency. It&#039;s a freaking paradise honestly. All this talk of child porn and that sort of thing? Well those bad things don&#039;t exist on the Silk Road. It is a place for people like myself to choose what we put into our bodies, and do it in the safest, cheapest way possible. So please stop reporting on child porn here, because that horrible smut exists on other parts of the Deep Web. Here, it would never be tolerated.<br /><br />I love the Silk Road. It&#039;s changed my life. I&#039;m happier than ever before, and I&#039;m never looking back. My depression is totally gone. My relationship is in a better state.

				great topic.<br /><br />i deal with depression and have my whole life.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t actually articulate this before reading this thread, but I&#039;ve been genuinely not depressed ever since i found silk road.&nbsp; I was smoking crappy regular weed and trying to score molly at raves when I went (but since the best raves are in canada i never brought anything back).<br /><br />since i&#039;ve joined up here i&#039;ve gotten into hash and oil which have turned my frown upside down.&nbsp; i&#039;m high as a kite all the time and that statement is not at all depressing to me.&nbsp; i see why hashish has been considered spiritual by so many people because it has been enhancing my life in ways i can&#039;t really describe.&nbsp; smoking oil has been great in a medical sense, because (for me) there is virtually no couch lock or comedown; i can still perform my job and go to the gym and walk my dog without having to wage psychic war just to get out of my chair.<br /><br />also, it had been a while since i did K and that was really pissing me off.&nbsp; i&#039;ve never been a constant K user, but I need to use it every so often to clear my head.&nbsp; otherwise shit just builds up and up and up until i&#039;m fucking miserable....a good tear with some K and molly will fix me right up.<br /><br />thank you silk road.&nbsp; i&#039;m praying to every god and angel I know that you live a long and happy life.

				Im eager to try out all the psychedelics Ive discovered on here. I think there is definitely a case for the occasional trip being good for you. I really need to rediscover that side of drugs instead of the copious amounts of alcohol and bags upon bags of cheap &#039;coke&#039;.<br /><br />So, for me, Silk Road is here to give me a choice in what I take instead of taking the only thing I can get my hands on...and that has got to be a good thing.

				I don&#039;t enjoy many substances but playing games after smoking weed is a totally enthralling experience for me. Same with drawing/painting.<br /><br />As I do not have many smoking friends anymore, I have very little access to anything locally. Anything worth the money or a person that isn&#039;t a stoned loser with a very short temper or anyone who&#039;s very intelligent when it comes to buying and selling. So it will help me enjoy my vice, every now and then, at a reasonable price and at a much higher quality than anything on the street.<br /><br />It has also given me an outlet for all my silly ideas. When I was very young I wanted to be in law enforcement and then after growing up with my dad (not an LEO, just a total controlling dick head), I became a firm believer that all people are just part of the bacterial system of Earth, each country is a vital organ and everyone needs to be allowed to do what they want as long as it doesn&#039;t remove from what other local people want to do or would inevitably cause harm to their immediate surroundings. Everything else is up to the governing bodies of each individual area, following the same general rules but without restraints. Tell people scamming other is punishable but allow most things to work themselves out. Don&#039;t lay blame on those who REACT to others ACTIONS. They made their decision thought about it and did it anyways. If someone feels recourse is needed and has the means to pursue, no one can stop them. This pertains to &quot;crimes&quot; as we see them now a days. Unwarranted acts of aggression are always considered &quot;viral&quot; to the bacterial body of Earth.<br /><br />So, yea, I enjoy this place when I have time to burn and information to offer up should anybody need it.

				REPOST:: STILL RELATIVELY RELEVANT, LOL ::<br /><br />Hello,<br />This is a throw away account, and no PM&#039;s will be answered or even checked. I am using multiple reflectors to get to this forum beyond simple TOR.<br /><br />Background (bear with me):<br /><br />I am a CBSA (Canadian Border Service Agent in a CCRA/ Canada Post clearing house. (the Candian version of the IRS in the USA). My job is secondary inspection, and I am what&#039;s called a team lead (first level management inside the government hierarchy).<br /><br />Three years ago, I was in an accident, the nature of which I will not disclose for security reasons. My rehab took over a year of exercise and a steady diet of Demerol (Meperidine) (50mg) IM, and Ativan (1mg) at least twice a day.&nbsp; Eventually the Demerol was switched out for Dilaudid (Hydromorphone).&nbsp; My physical health is better, but I have developed a nasty dependence on Opiates and Benzo&#039;s since that I have been unwilling/unable to kick.<br /><br />This was not a problem, as I had a friendly doctor, but lately the OXY scare has made even the most liberal MD switch people off to things like Toradol (Ketorolac) and Talwin (Pentazocine) in order to avoid the hassles from the CMA (Canadian Medical Association.) and lose their prescribing license.<br /><br />I know all the ER shopping tricks, and ER nurses and doctors do too. That is a pointless endeavour.&nbsp; I have acquaintances who are B.R.M (if I have to explain that one, you don&#039;t need to know), who hook me up occasionally, but they want unreasonable favors in my official capacity as payment.<br /><br />SR. Is a god-send.&nbsp; The prices are terrible for somebody like me on a government salary, but some creative juggling has allowed me to control my habit.&nbsp; I talked to several separate vendors who have expressed concerns shipping to Canada because of our strict customs regimen. So my gift back to you international vendors is some tricks of the trade to increase the likelyhood of you getting your packages through.<br /><br />1: Do not use brown bubble wrap envelopes with pre-printed BS looking return addresses that do not match the postmark.&nbsp; That&#039;s going to secondary.<br /><br />2: Never pack glass. It tinkles, in transit, even surrounded in bubble wrap, it&#039;s hard/impossible to hide it&#039;s shape from our BSX scanners. We seize more steroids than any other drugs because of this.<br /><br />3: Do not try to use perfume/cologne/coffee/patchouli/sage to hide tell-tale odours.&nbsp; Our dogs love all those smells, and again: Welcome to secondary.<br /><br />4: If you ship more than an ounce of anything, it will more likely get through if you make it look like a care package from family.&nbsp; Handwritten address, full return addresses, and neat careful tape jobs with your product safetly placed in some more innocuous container.<br /><br />5:Powders andd pills leave a very distinct outline on the outside of plain envelopes. Buy those cheap leather single credit card holders and put them in something like that. We see packages all the time with 20-30 little round punch-out looking holes in plain white envelopes.&nbsp; Welcome to secondary.<br /><br />6: Watch countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;These countries are updated monthly, but the following are a giant red flag and no matter how pretty the package, it&#039;s getting a second look:&nbsp; Pakistan, India, Netherlands, Greece, Afghanistan, Columbia, Panama, Portugal, Serbia, Croatia.&nbsp; Use- re-mailers, try to get your packages sent from anywhere in the UK (with the exception of Northern Ireland).&nbsp; Italy comes and goes as a red-flag origin, but is usually safe.&nbsp; If you mist ship from these countries, ship small letter shaped/sized documents, postcards are best.<br /><br />7: DO NOT SHIP LIQUIDS. I repeat, DO NOT SHIP liquids.&nbsp; They break, they leak, they condensate, they swish when you move them.&nbsp; We have a weight scale that rolls suspicious packages at 1.5Gs RMS and it tells us immediately if there is liquid in the package.<br /><br />8: Use exact postage.&nbsp; It seems strange, but illicits usually over-postage their packs, apparently Ted Kaszinski did this too.. odd.<br /><br />So those are your biggest hurdles shipping internationally into Canada.&nbsp; If you do it smartly, aren&#039;t overzealous, split your large shipments and avoid Montreal, Cornwall, and Vancouver&nbsp; clearing houses, I&#039;d say you have a&nbsp; better than 90% chance of getting your product through un-molested.<br /><br />Out.

				For me being a straight laced, Some what Techy Nerd, Non-Violent people lover. I came here because I got tired of thug dealers,meeting them in dark parking lots, worrying about getting mugged or shot. <br /><br />Here everything is anonymous. <br /><br />This is a safe place for responsible adults who like to use drugs, Yes there are responsible non violent people with college degrees and excellent high paying jobs , who like to do a little Cock or MDMA over the weekend or maybe your like me, I have no Insurance so a DR visit is $150 Cash, Plus cost of script at pharmacy $25-$30, Here I can order my 20-30 2MG xanax a month and it&#039;s still cheaper than the DR and that&#039;s if the he will prescribe me 2MG. In this day more and more good Doctors are shying away from prescribing controlled substances out of fear of being arrested,DR&#039;s all over the U.S. have been arrested, so Who suffers?? the patient!!!!!<br /><br />Oh also it&#039;s nobodys FUCKING BUSINESS WHAT I PUT INTO MY BODY SO LONG AS I&#039;M NOT HURTING ANYONE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />ONE LAST THING I THINK THIS NEEDS TO #1 RULE HERE SHOULD BE &quot;THE FIRST RULE ABOUT SR, IS WE DON&#039;T TALK ABOUT SR&quot; <br /><br />NOBODY KNOWS I USE THIS SERVICE. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m here for the weed, and only the weed.&nbsp; I LOVE that Silk Road gives me access to the high-quality stuff without having to leave the comfort and safety of my home.&nbsp; Frankly, without Silk Road, I would have zero access.<br /><br />I mentioned in another thread that I survived a serious traumatic brain injury and am now dealing with mental health problems like depression (? - not sure) and irrational thoughts.&nbsp; I really appreciate the relief that marijuana gives me.&nbsp; I would much rather smoke dope than ingest some strange chemical manufactured in a pharmaceutical lab.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Silk Road, for giving me the option to take a natural drug to alleviate my pain.

				I know the ins/outs of MDMA and would test dealers stuff right in front of them and walk out the door. Id ask them what its cut with id weigh it on my own scale infront of them people claiming downwards of .5 as 1g etc.. selling complete garbage pills as E <br /><br />moved to belgium 3 years ago and it was better I could get some nice nice MDMA at events, met a ton of loving people and had a never ending supply of w/e i wanted, they would go heavy they would chill with you, party with you everything. I even would give them a place to stay if they were having trouble &quot;most weren&#039;t big time dealers and just sold to get by, homeless or the whole occupy movement. <br /><br />Moving back to the states a few months ago I was almost laughing at what people were taking at some local events<br />before SR i just called up some friends in belgium and had them ship me ~50 speakers/defqons and 10g MDMA it was just vacuum sealed in a box with some other random stuff in there not really stealth at all. Friends tried that and rolled for the first time in their lives now with SR i stay domestic after reading a ton about customs etc.. Ive only done one order international since being on here..<br />100% delivery success to me so far /knocks on wood<br /><br />I never sell to people, I party hard and give it away, love everyone<br />pick up complete strangers to give them rides to events<br />pay peoples entry to large events or cover a hotel for a large event<br />&lt;3 the people &lt;3 the music <br />in a position to help some people feel good and it makes me feel good<br /><br />SR you are my US version of the Belgian community I love you!<br /><br />-HardPanda<br />

Literally.&nbsp; I suspect that there are many on SR just like us who grow up and simply lose contact with anyone that could supply us with anything. I&#039;ve talked about it with close friends and they were just as at a loss as we were on how to find anyone or approach anyone else to find simple things like pot or shrooms. I had grown some shrooms a few years ago for our own use and it was a modest success but a lot of work and we had a child in the intervening years so we basically stopped all production in the house in the run up to me getting pregnant.<br /><br />Finding SR has enabled my husband and I to have enriched experiences together that we would not be able to have given our current lifestyle in a safe and meaningful way. I am in a comfortable job with no drug testing and this enables us to partake of pot that was unavailable 20 years ago. I find pot more stress relieving than any pill prescribed by any doctor.&nbsp; We&#039;ve now had 3 mushroom trips in just as many months (literally going away on a long weekend without the child and tripping on shrooms) and each of these experiences has brought us closer as a couple then we have felt in years. In short - SR has enabled us to live the life we WANT to live not the life we HAVE to live due to prohibition.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even been able to share some of my new booty with my close friends who otherwise had been at a loss. Now they are happy and content as well.<br /><br />Thank you to my vendors for being so discreet and having competitive pricing as well as good reviews both on SR and the boards.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />IN a similar situation. me and wifey smoke and it just brought way way way closer.

I really don&#039;t give a shit about survival.

				Didn&#039;t read the rest of the thread maybe Im repeating some already said. Sorry in advance for bad english, also maybe a bit much text?- blame the drugs=P<br />Heres a few thoughts I thought Id throw out now, maybe I forgot something.. noticed I havent really thrown out a &quot;thanks&quot; in any way for this magnificent place and its community before either so thought it&#039;d be fitting here now.<br /><br />Proper quality MDMA from the amazing vendors here has been a great thing for my personal development and relationships I believe, and may even have saved me some health or atleast miseries over using unknown and more expensive powders from the street that I have had ill effects from in the past. I&#039;m actually not sure I would ever be able to assured of having real good quality MDMA if it werent for this place!<br />After use of this drug first many months ago now I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m also a more positive,caring person- I also think I apprecciate music more than ever before!;)<br /><br />Theres a plethora of interesting drugs that seems may provide beneficial or very helpful in some situations I am yet to explore and learn more about- powerful tools that thanks to misuse are normally unavailable to the public.<br />I am sure the stay here will prove very educational and beneficial for my wellbeing and also increased feeling of freedom in our increasingly restrictive, monitored and chained-up world<br /><br />Gotten (and getting=) my curiosity fulfilled by being able to explore some new exotic drugs I doubtfully would otherwise ever get my hands on, atleast of this assured quality and support around it. Thanks to this I will for eternity be able to pay back to these type of communities with my new-aquired knowledge in similar helpful and safe ways to ensure that other future users who choose to indulge will have a safe and pleasant experience like I had thanks to all these great, helpful and friendly-minded people being nice,honest and caring. Seeing the benefits of this makes the kindness and desire to help others be contagious and surely is a small part of eventually making the world a better place, little by little:)<br /><br />I have thru my until now short stay here and other helpful similar communities come to believe that the main key to most of the drug-problems of today around the world is simply education- knowledge on how (if at all) to use drugs to maximize benefit and minimize riscs. I think SR is a great beacon of freedom in this respect, among several things by the somewhat troublesome ways of first getting started using SR- that surely helps in this by filtering out most of the irresponsible users unwilling of studying to use the drugs safely before taking the leap to use, and further supporting and ensuring the safety of those who have studied enough to reach the confidence of safe drug-use themselves. I very much wish it will go on in a similar way even if more convenient ways of placing orders are found, to have supportive,friendly and proper information with focus on safety easily available coming with it and something that is considered something the user learn BEFORE putting any potentially riscy chemicals in their bodies as is common thru bad street-advice. Although reading here and looking up info on safe use and all is not technically required to use the site, I believe very few users do not. I&#039;m feel pretty sure that the average Silk Road-druguser is a much smarter and safer druguser than any one from the street, which again benefits the society as a whole saving many miseries of misuse. <br /><br /><br />Just having the choise - the freedom to if desired - is another great value the users surely learns apprecciate. A freedom that thanks to supportive and safe information easily available alongside it seems to benefit users idelogicaly by reminding us all that we as individuals are our own masters and the only ones who can or should be to decide things like what chemicals we wish to consume and for what reasons.<br /><br />Also I have gotten more into the usage and info around these technologies used. I wish for a great future for the .onion-networks and the Bitcoin, will support them any way I can in the future and hope to make it the internal TOR-network (.onion domains) my permanent home online some day if it&#039;s allowed to grow into other sites/networks/services if it proves resilient and where humanity can be left in peace to communicate without the chains and cameras<br /><br /><br />I very much look forward to a bright, informed and healthy future of learning more about different interesting chemicals - many that I otherwise thru the street would have gotten polluted, cut and dangerous versions of instead. I wish every drug user use SR instead of the street! And like most people here then naturally study and do research first.<br />Who knows, maybe I would have overdosed or had another unfortunate event often affiliated with street-drugs of unknown quality/type, had I not been able to get such reliable high quality as here.<br /><br /><br />I guess its impossible to put a number on the # of lives the site have saved by providing a reliable and safe alternative somewhat built upon requiring knowledge and interest before use, but I&#039;m sure theyre many, and the ones who now can relax knowing they get top quality and reliable drugs must be atleast similar to the population in a small city!<br /><br /><br /><br />Hmm.. that&#039;s all for now I think, I may have missed something but... <br />Sorry for bad typing, non-english and Im drugged and all atm=P just felt like throwing it out there now I saw it up.<br /><br />THanks again to everyone for making this place what it is.<br />Lets hope for many more years of educated freedom of choise!=))&nbsp;

				I&#039;m loving it! Best site I have ever found on the web and I&#039;ve been a surfer since windows 95 came out. Really since DOS but I wasn&#039;t so active then. The drug game is my genre. Not just getting fucked up but just communicating with the people who are involved. Maybe I like the idea of real freedom, of being a rebel against the establishment. I don&#039;t know but I blend well with this kind of community

				I thought I might as well contribute.<br />About a month ago, I bought 2 mollies. I was about to take one, when my best friend texted me. She told me that she was going to kill herself. She had been suicidal for a few weeks before this, so I drove to her house as fast as I could and I stopped her right before she could pull the trigger. We talked for about 10 minutes, when I realized I still had the E on me. I handed her one of the pills and told her to take it. Fast forward about an hour, and we&#039;re having one of the deepest and most wonderful conversation we&#039;ve ever had. I stayed there for a couple hours, until we both came down and talked some more. Long story short, you guys saved my best friend&#039;s life. If I didn&#039;t have those pills on me, she would have killed herself. Thank you.

Same with drawing/painting.<br /><br />As I do not have many smoking friends anymore, I have very little access to anything locally. Anything worth the money or a person that isn&#039;t a stoned loser with a very short temper or anyone who&#039;s very intelligent when it comes to buying and selling. So it will help me enjoy my vice, every now and then, at a reasonable price and at a much higher quality than anything on the street.<br /><br />It has also given me an outlet for all my silly ideas. When I was very young I wanted to be in law enforcement and then after growing up with my dad (not an LEO, just a total controlling dick head), I became a firm believer that all people are just part of the bacterial system of Earth, each country is a vital organ and everyone needs to be allowed to do what they want as long as it doesn&#039;t remove from what other local people want to do or would inevitably cause harm to their immediate surroundings. Everything else is up to the governing bodies of each individual area, following the same general rules but without restraints. Tell people scamming other is punishable but allow most things to work themselves out. Don&#039;t lay blame on those who REACT to others ACTIONS. They made their decision thought about it and did it anyways. If someone feels recourse is needed and has the means to pursue, no one can stop them. This pertains to &quot;crimes&quot; as we see them now a days. Unwarranted acts of aggression are always considered &quot;viral&quot; to the bacterial body of Earth.<br /><br />So, yea, I enjoy this place when I have time to burn and information to offer up should anybody need it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ｏｎｅ　ｄａｙ，　ａｌｌ　ｔｈｅｓｅ　ｐｏｓｉｔｉｖｅ　ｆｏｒｕｍ　ｐｏｓｔｓ　ｗｉｌｌ　ｂｅ　ａｄｍｉｔｔｅｄ　ａｓ　ｅｖｉｄｅｎｃｅ　ｉｎ　ｗｈａｔ　ｉｓ　ｓｈａｐｉｎｇ　ｕｐ　ｔｏ　ｂｅ　ｔｈｅ　ｂｉｇｇｅｓｔ　ｔｒｉａｌ　ｅｖｅｒ．<br />Ｔｈｅ　Ｐｅｏｐｌｅ　ｖｓ<br />Ｋｅｅｐ　’ｅｍ　ｃｏｍｉｎｇ．　ｗｅ　ａｌｌ　Ｌｏｖｅ　ｓｔｕｆｆ　ｌｉｋｅ　ｔｈｉｓ　ｕｐ　ｉｎ　ｔｈｅ　Ｈｅａｖｅｎｓ　ｗｈｅｒｅ　ｔｈｅ　Ｍｏｓｔ　Ｈｉｇｈ　ｌｉｖｅ　＝）

				For moi? SR means not having to risk my health taking unknown substances. <br />Also not having to deal with unsavory dealers is a plus.<br />Do I want to buy &quot;a gram of ket mate for a tenner?&quot; off Mr baggy trousers over here? <br />No. No I would NOT. <br />I would like to buy it online where I know what im getting. <br /><br />I also like the free market aspect to such a website.

				I was born with multiple disabilities. I wear a prosthetic leg that greatly adds to my quality of life, but at the cost of pain and soreness. On long days, when I come home the only thing that really helps soothe my pain is a few bowls of A+ medicinal. Unfortunately, where I live does not have access to medical marijuana and I am unable to acquire good medicine unless: A.) I deal with unsavory types and pay more for less quality with the added risk of being robbed/ripped off/arrested, or B.) Go online and read reviews and do ample research before finally deciding on the medicine that is right for me.<br /><br />It seems like a simple no brainer, I use SR because it adds so much to the quality of my life. I enjoy the tranquility that has been restored to my nights. I can now enjoy reading for a few hours before I go to sleep, versus before where I would think of nothing more than the pain.<br /><br />SR is the greatest thing that could have ever happened to a person like me; fair pricing on excellent medicine!

				Thanks for this thread. I read most of it and it nearly made me cry, it feels like coming <br />home, it is a cliche but not less true.<br /><br />That is the first thing SR gives me, like-minded people and people I think understand that <br />drugs (horrible word...) are not evil, au contraire.<br />SR gives me access to (psychedelic) drugs and what does that mean to me?<br /><br />I have used weed extensively in my teens and I did not realize it at the time, but it did <br />not do a lot of good to me. (sorry guys, but hang on). Hash as I called it, enhanced my <br />already depressed state, I stopped and I found love (the best drug -e-v-e-r-) and I had many <br />years (20 yrs) of having a caring family life, raising kids (nothing is more rewarding) and <br />having busy job. <br />There is a but, life especially the last 3 years was an uphill battle, increasingly so, I <br />was beginning to feel more and more empty of emotions .... <br /><br />Then, a year ago a very dear family member introduced me to mdma at a Warpaint gig. Without <br />her knowing this, the experience changed me, it was like a switch was turned on in my head <br />and there was light. Let me try to explain, I have been going through most of my life <br />fearing, fear of people, fear of stability, just fearful. That evening on mdma&nbsp; :-* (and the <br />morning after) this fear was gone, I was calm, just calm and alive. Remember I have never <br />known this state of being (perhaps a normal state for some..) up until then, I did not know <br />it was possible for me to be around people and be calm and the love I had at that time! I <br />wish to love people and compliment them. As it turned out the experience had a positive <br />effect in other areas of my life, I am more caring, understanding and I can concentrate on <br />what is important and what makes me and others happy (ish). I now do an mdma&nbsp; :-* trip every so <br />often and it relieves most of my fears. <br /><br />It is such an eye opener for me that I can be a responsible member of society and at the <br />same time organise time where I can trip and learn more about myself and feel connected - <br />again. (Life is worth living after all!!). Drugs (opiates mostly??) can and do so often <br />destruct lives, but I now know that drugs also can enhance and in my case, give live a new <br />lease.<br /><br />I now use weed (vapor) and it gives me a great feel for music and some mind fucks (!), no <br />more hangovers! <br />I now trip on shrooms and they make me see how beautiful the world is, shrooms make me happy <br />(low dose) and open that other eye.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to do my first LSD trip; it has been ordered here. <br /><br />Thanks SR and all who make this possible, may you be around for a long time to come. (I <br />cannot operate without!!) <br />&nbsp;:)<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve deemed myself a psychonaut since I first experimented with 2c-E. My second experienced really opened my eyes to new ideas and led to me making a few decisions that have, more or less, defined my life. I began to feel like an outsider looking in, not just at society, but into myself. I searched for a long time as an adolescent to find the next great trip or the next life changing experience but never having much luck, that was until I discovered the SR. A truly ingenious website that I&#039;m shocked to have never found before. It takes away that awkward drug dealer confrontation where it&#039;s hard to define the relationship, because while they may sell drugs, they are still a human being with the same wants and needs as the rest of us. This place has taken all of that away providing friendly customer service with none of the attachments but all of the security. <br />&nbsp; With the discovery of this website I have been able to once again explore the world of psychedelics. This time though, I am not alone in my journey. I now have a new partner in life that I can introduce to my once solitary world. Our venture has, I felt, brought us closer and opened up the door to help her deal with some of her personal problems. It also seems that it&#039;s made me more excepting of some of things she does, more patient if you will. There is still a lot more to be gained and learned from our trips (pun intended), but until there is, I believe that will give our relationship something to hold together with. <br />&nbsp; Also DMT... WOW! It brought about changes in my concept of our multiverse.&nbsp;

				A relative of mine in his teens at uni wanted to buy some E. <br /><br />He came to see me, telling me he could buy some pills with a MacDonald sign on them.<br /><br />Later that week in the North West of England a 15 yr old girl died after being spiked with these pills.<br /><br />They contain PED<br /><br />My relative took REAL MDMA thanks to SR.<br /><br />Left to th street he may have taken a fake E or even fake coke with RCs in there for the kick. NO coke whatsover. £20&nbsp; a gram says it all. But people get drunk and decide to buy this at 2.00am.<br /><br />I have put several people onto some pure drug they would buy regardless.<br /><br />I tell all my younger buddies and relatives NOT to ever buy E or coke from some club or street vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting my boss some decent coke and going out for a meal with my missus. SR might win me promotion and had already seen me get tons of easy overtime as I got some MDMA for the boss and his missus who loved it so much she actually texted me to say she loved me!<br /><br />Its good to be able to get people top quality drugs. I make no money. I will get a few lines of yayo so its all good&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I also got the manager of a local club some top hash. Now I don&#039;t pay to get in!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />SR is a good way to maybe get favors. Lets face it it. When you really feel like some drug and somebody delivers top quality then you would go out your way to help them.<br /><br />My boss and his wife went home at 12.30am from some social event. they had 1.7 grams of coke. UK coke. They went home with headaches and nausea. I told my boss about 100mg of washed coke lasting me all might and feeling great plus getting something to eat also! And sleep! (with a benzo!)<br /><br />So - the SR has enhanced my life - not that I used it for that but people I dome favors for now feel they owe me a favor. A boss, some director plus other workers who are useful at getting stuff for free! I got 500 foot of 2 by 2 wood just for getting 10 grams of hash!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />My women likes me more as I can now buy her a decent coke and have learned to wash it for her!<br /><br />SR helps me out. I need certain drugs to get along sometimes. Pain relief is big for me. I need some stimulants to do work that needs me awake! This brings extra wages. SR got me paid more. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Silk road, has brought me many things over the past month or so of my arriving here.<br /><br />all i can say is....<br /><br />Thank you Silk road!<br /><br />Thanks to you, i am able to purchase my illicit narcotics for private/personal uses without having to deal with shady characters in the real world, that could rip me off, hold me at gun point, many numerous unsafe scenarios. <br />Where as there are only 2 scenarios in which shit can go bad.<br />A. You get scammed<br />B. You get Caught shipping or receiving... <br /><br />Other than that...Silk road is a god send, Im sure im not the only one who is grateful to the fact many of us no longer need to scower our towns and counties in search of a reliable drug dealer to get our fixes. <br /><br />And to be quite honest, i like this process of getting my products so much more than anything else i&#039;ve tried. <br />Everything about this site, and its community, is amazing...and im glad i could be apart of it with everyone else.

				I want to speak for my sister regarding SR<br /><br />she has been overworked for years. stressed beyond anything I have endured and yet selflessly absorbs others problems for years. This resulted to make her closed up, almost apathetic, with a sense of depravity that i knew she was not meant to have or be. I told my bro-in-law that they both need to sit down one day and take MDMA for therapeutic reasons and see it through. I truly believed this was the drug that would unlatch her from this unnatural like behavior she conditioned herself to be through this stress.. she was always a optimistic person.<br /><br />it was tough...VERY tough talking them into doing it though (they are over 30 years old and JUST started smoking pot...this was a big step)<br /><br />i taught them everything..the chemicals involved..the brains response..the metabolic breakdown..neurotoxic possibilities...preventative steps, things to do after and the spacing between doses and&nbsp; the purity of it as i showed them the professionalism that is to be found with the right amount of research on Silk Road and then I let them decide.<br /><br />well they did it for the first time last week. and i said id coach them through it. i was there for the first 2 hours...it was mind numbingly amazing experience for me to see.<br /><br />they were children again...and more over..my sister said things and opened up in ways i never thought was possible...at moments they almost lost sight of what was happening...like..fear overwhelmed them and&nbsp; they panicked at the come up..and the sheer velocity of emotional oozing they were in...i coached them through it..played music that changed their mood.. and planted key words and ideas for them to jump off from.....i left when i knew it they were comfortable and and sense of &#039;auto-pilot&#039; existed...<br /><br />needless to say..the next few days i was ravaged with messages and calls from them thanking me...and my sister having gained more and let out more than she or even I ever thought was possible. I knew she needed this but i didnt know just how rewarding it was how immediate the positives were.<br /><br />to have such a pure drug of choice and have such wonderful people on this forum with knowledge and good insight is a blessing.<br /><br />having many transactions and plenty of drugs ive tried just for the fuck of it was and is fun..but to change someones life for the better...release stress and break down communicative walls...just open up someone and put them on a more positive path...well that is groundbreaking. This place can be whatever we make of it. for some, it can be a real dark and empty way of life...though i think that is few and far between., some for business and a very exotic and interesting one at that, other micro-profitting, self sustaining drug habits...yadda yadda, but all in all this is a community of people that i think work synergistically to a better life experience.<br /><br />.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				This an example of a typical day after SR came into my life:<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m going to take drugs all day today because I have the day off work. Cool.<br /><br />After breakfast I leisurely smoke a very pleasant .5g of high quality crack which I had received in the post a few days ago from a trusted seller on Silk Road. It&#039;s excellent stuff and really hits the spot. A very strong initial rush with a nice long tail as well. Whoever washed this stuff up did a great job and the cocaine they used is pretty fucking good as well. <br /><br />I then follow that up with .1g of meth which arrived in the post this morning. I smoke in my own time after a light lunch. I&#039;ve never tried meth and I have always wanted to give a go but to get meth where I live is impossible. When I saw it on Silk Road I thought well why not? I smoke the stuff in this glass stem bowl. It tastes revolting. To be honest I&#039;m not blown away by it. It&#039;s okay but I can&#039;t see myself ordering some more. Glad I tried it though. What a life it would be never to try anything new. Then I take the dog for a long walk. He has a great time. So do I. <br /><br />After I get back and dry the mud off the dog I have a cup of tea and smoke a match head sized bit of china white heroin on some tin foil. The china white arrived yesterday in the mail from another trusted seller on Silk Road. Hmm. Superb quality and it is the real deal. This is some of the strongest and cleanest heroin in the world - and I got it in the post off the internet! I stick the rest in a draw to have on another day. Then I drink a couple of beers and eat a light dinner. I should be asleep by midnight. Nice. Awesome day off. I&#039;m happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br />And this is an example of a typical day before SR: <br /><br />I&#039;ve decided I&#039;m going to take drugs all day today because I have the day off work. I get my shit together and head out. I get on the bus and go to XXXX. When I get there, I call up XXXX. Then I wait fucking ages, 30 minutes at least and enough time to get some nasty stares from the residents of this housing block I am on - they all know why I am here. Then some shotta on a BMX turns up. He gives me the customary aggressive head nod as he takes the drugs out of his mouth. I hand the money over, he gives me the drugs. I have to stick them in my mouth even though they&#039;ve just come out of his mouth. Gross. Then I get the bus back to my place. The whole thing takes two hours so its already nearly the afternoon of my day off. Better get moving!&nbsp; <br /><br />I open the drugs. Shit. The shotta or maybe XXXX has screwed up the order and I haven&#039;t got what I asked for. For fucks sake! He&#039;s fucking ripped me off, the cunt. I call up XXXX. XXXX says it isn&#039;t his fault and he&#039;ll get it right next time. I put the phone down knowing full well that XXXX is full of shit. But what can I do? Ring Trading Standards? I smoke the crack. It&#039;s incredibly fucking bad. It&#039;s so fucking bad I&#039;m practically burning 0.2g rocks in the pipe and I&#039;m still not really getting any distance. Fuck this. I smoke the entire fucking lot like some type of fiend.<br /><br />It&#039;s now 1.45pm.<br /><br />Time to smoke the heroin. I open it up and before I&#039;ve even tasted it I know its cut to fuck. The colour is all wrong and the texture is shit. And it looks fucking tiny. I stick it on my digital scales and it comes back as a 0.14 which means its fucking under weight. It burns red and short and after smoking all of it I&#039;m not even really that high. Fuck it. It&#039;s 3.30pm now. What am I going to do? Fuck it. I give my dog a biscuit and I head out. The dog looks kind of sad when I leave so I try not to look at him. <br /><br />Then I get on the bus and go to XXXX. I call up XXXX and place my order and he assures me he will sort out the earlier fuck up and that I am &#039;his brother&#039; or some shit. I wait fucking ages - fucking ages! - and, like last time, the passing residents in this concrete hell glare at me because I&#039;m buying drugs in there estate. They&#039;re staring at me like I&#039;m utter scum. Then some shotta on a BMX turns up. It&#039;s the same kid as before. Cocky fucker. <br /><br />I say to him &#039;You fucked up my last order mate.&#039; He looks put out and says &#039;Fuck you! I just deliver this shit. It&#039;s fucking XXXX&#039;s fault.&#039; I say &#039;It&#039;s your fault. You should have checked you had the right order before leaving.&#039; He steps towards me, head lowered and butts into me saying &#039;You fucking want some blud?! Uh? You wanna get mash up! These are my fuckin ends blud!&#039; I push him away and tell him to back the fuck up. Then we have an argument which ends with me saying &#039;Don&#039;t tell me what to do! You should be in school!!! I mean how old are you? Fifteen?! You should be at school. Not selling shit drugs.&#039; and him shouting back &#039;Fuck you! Prick. These are my ends yo! This is where I fuckin rep! If I sees you on road you&#039;re gettin shanked bruv! For real! Get me.&#039; Eventually we both shut the fuck up. He spits the drugs out of his mouth and into his hand. I give him the money, he gives me the drugs. They&#039;re covered in his spit. I stick the drugs in my mouth. We go our separate ways without either of us saying goodbye but he can&#039;t resist shouting &#039;Pussy-O!&#039; at me before he turns off down an alley. Little prick. <br /><br />Then I get the bus back to the flat. I spit the drugs into my hand and check out what I got. Well at least this time XXXX got it right. Then I have a smoke. The crack is shit but a little better than the last lot and there is just about enough in there to do something. I smoke the fucking lot in an hour. Then I smoke all the heroin. It&#039;s cut to fuck and tastes of mannitol which is used to treat urine infections in patients with kidney failure. Fuck knows what else is in there. Not much heroin that&#039;s for sure. Once I finish I sit about feeling frustrated because the drugs didn&#039;t get me where I wanted to go. Fuck it. I look at my watch. 6pm. I still haven&#039;t taken the dog for a walk. He&#039;s staring at me. Fuck it. I take the dog out. I walk to the bus stop.<br /><br />Then I get on a bus and go to XXXX. I call up XXXX and he takes my order. He doesn&#039;t say &#039;third time today!&#039; or any of that shit because three times in a day is standard for his punters. Fuck, some of them must do about 6 runs a day as they&#039;re fucked up beggars trying to raise the money for a minimum score which is 2 items. XXXX must have about 300 clients. Fuck knows. I&#039;ve known him for two years and I&#039;ve never even met the cunt. He&#039;s just a voice on a phone. After about forty minutes of getting glared at like I am the scum of the earth by a few residents of this urban hell a shotta turns up on foot. It&#039;s a different kid. <br /><br />This one must be new to the game because he&#039;s paranoid as fuck and he&#039;s looking everywhere and asking me if I&#039;m an undercover policeman and all sorts of shit. He&#039;s also scared shitless of my dog and seems to think I&#039;ve taken the dog along to attack him. He even ends up accusing my dog of being an undercover police as well. I tell the kid to calm the fuck down and stop being such a dick. He goes mental and says &#039;If blue boy sees me hanging out wiv some white prick like you and your stupid fuckin&#039; dog then I&#039;m gettin lock down blud! Straight! U get me?!&#039; <br /><br />The kid looks so young it&#039;s a joke so I say so. &#039;Yeah well you should be at school mate. How old are you? Thirteen?&#039; The kid tells me to fuck off. Then he spits the drugs into his hand and thrusts them at me. &#039;Here, take em. Take em. Feds is hot round ere! Come on man!&#039; I take the drugs. They&#039;re fucking wet with spit. &#039;Stick em in your mouth blud, stick em in your mouth!&#039; I stick the drugs in my mouth. &#039;Gimme money man! Gimme the P&#039;s, come on blud! Hurry up!&#039; I hold out the money which he snatches from me and counts. Satisfied he peels the fuck out of there without saying goodbye. I get the bus back to my place.<br /><br />I get in and spit the drugs into my hand. For fucks sake! XXXX has got the deal wrong again! I fucking call him up and tell him. He tells me that it&#039;s me that is wrong. I start to argue but XXXX calls me a &#039;blodclot crackead&#039; and if I have a problem then I should go round and see him and we&#039;ll sort it the fuck out. Well there&#039;s no way I&#039;m doing that. He knows it and I know it. XXXX is a crack dealer yardie type. I bet&#039;s he&#039;s killed people. Fuck it. XXXX is in total control here and even though I am a regular customer of his he quite simply doesn&#039;t give a fuck. I let it slide. I tell him I may see him next week and put the phone down. Dickhead. Next time I score I&#039;m going to ring someone else. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m short of dealers. I&#039;ve got about twenty or so on my phone. They&#039;re all just as shit and most of them I&#039;ve never met. Then I smoke the crack followed by the heroin. As usual its shit. <br /><br />I look at my watch: 11pm! <br /><br />Shit! <br /><br />My one day off is over. <br /><br />I&#039;ve just spent over £200 on shit drugs and it&#039;s time for bed. Fuck it. What a waste of a day. I didn&#039;t even take the dog on a proper walk. <br /><br />I go to bed feeling pretty fucking ashamed of myself and full of rage at the world. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Literally.&nbsp; I suspect that there are many on SR just like us who grow up and simply lose contact with anyone that could supply us with anything. I&#039;ve talked about it with close friends and they were just as at a loss as we were on how to find anyone or approach anyone else to find simple things like pot or shrooms. I had grown some shrooms a few years ago for our own use and it was a modest success but a lot of work and we had a child in the intervening years so we basically stopped all production in the house in the run up to me getting pregnant.<br /><br />Finding SR has enabled my husband and I to have enriched experiences together that we would not be able to have given our current lifestyle in a safe and meaningful way. I am in a comfortable job with no drug testing and this enables us to partake of pot that was unavailable 20 years ago. I find pot more stress relieving than any pill prescribed by any doctor.&nbsp; We&#039;ve now had 3 mushroom trips in just as many months (literally going away on a long weekend without the child and tripping on shrooms) and each of these experiences has brought us closer as a couple then we have felt in years. In short - SR has enabled us to live the life we WANT to live not the life we HAVE to live due to prohibition.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even been able to share some of my new booty with my close friends who otherwise had been at a loss.

				Now I can buy drugs without being scammed with shit.. the money is not the real problem, the problem is that the may sell you chemicals that are worst to your body that the drug itself, and they probably do nothing.. So, yes.. It has enriched my life...<br />Plus now I can buy a lot more of different drugs, before I was just limited to mdma, cocaine, weed and speed.

				Gone are the days of &quot;fronting&quot; money to unscrupulous street dealers, being shorted, having to buy inferior product or conduct transactions in ways that could easily reveal you as a buyer. I&#039;ve been able to talk to drug users with a brain, who share the same views on the current laws as we are mostly productive members of society. Society isn&#039;t harmed by the Silk Road as drug transactions are kept away from the public, and high quality drugs mean that there is less risk of a person contributing to society overdosing on anything cut to shit as an effect of prohibition.

				<br />I took LSD for the first time, bought two tabs from the road. Ate them both early in the morning, then went for a walk in the woods subsequent to listening to Todd Rundgren&#039;s &quot;A Wizard, A True Star&quot;. The substance and experience was interesting and highly rewarding, but it was not until I took a tab of 2mg 25I-Nbome that things truly become existential on the level of a ++++. <br /><br />Rather strangely, I have a fair amount of experience with psychedelics, yet had never bothered to purchase LSD prior to this experience. After consuming the 25I, I laid down at a grassy beach overlooking a local reservoir, and immediately began to trip harder than I have ever done so before. The trees, the water, the sand- I was acutely aware of the fact that everything around me was alive. This sensation was so piercing, so unicitous, that several times I found myself nearly asphyxiating myself due to the sensation of being empathogenically and entactogenically attached to all the life forms around myself. This was dangerous, and I learned a very good lesson that day- give, and take. Responsibility must be used at all times. The combination of these substances, although highly rewarding in experience, was irresponsible on my part, especially in lieu of the dose used. A rather profound thought instantiated this feeling of universal attachment to life- that is, the thought that the very reason we are alive as human beings is due to a process of biological sympathy,&nbsp; attachment to oxygen- give, and take. Inhale, and exhale. It was subsequent to that thought that I laid down in the sand, and saw a million strings (topological quantity in physics) in neon red and black, on an order of magnitude much larger than myself, overtake my closed eyelids. A million symmetric, pyramidal-goniometrically organized Vedic-type eyes danced upon these strings, and various related imageries dominated the whole of this trip. This sensation lasted for several hours. <br /><br />Upon returning home, later that night, the LSD became dominant- most likely instantiated by the 25I/Marijuana. I stumbled upon something I had encountered earlier in the day, Marshall McLuhan on CBC TV. Initially, I had listened to him discuss on YouTube the relation between Finnegan&#039;s Wake and LSD after a curious Google search regarding these two things. How fortuitous- how serendipitously engaging it was that I then stumbled upon the full album of &quot;The Media is the Massage&quot;. I filled whole notebooks, wrote 3 poems, and since then have written several essays on these basic concepts. I&#039;ve also purchased &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man&quot;, and it is one of the best books I have ever read, barring those of T.S. Eliot, Lewis Carroll, James Joyce, Alan Watts and Lao Tzu. <br /><br />Since then, I&#039;ve placed an order for more LSD...Ah well, it&#039;s a night for me- time to go pass the wake back to Jim Morrison.<br /><br /><br />

				Fuck me bottrop, that&#039;s the fuckin&#039; most awesome post I&#039;ve ever read!!<br /><br />That&#039;s exactly it, isn&#039;t it.&nbsp; The safe and easy access to mind/life altering substances for me at least, is a basic right.&nbsp; If my body and my existence is my own, then how I chose to live that is also my own (with the usual &#039;no harm&#039; provisos).<br /><br />If I want to drop an E on a Friday night, or have a trip with the missus on the weekend, why should ANYONE have to go through the current environment to procure said substances, as mandated by ridiculous governance?&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in being involved in the current real-world distro methods - I don&#039;t want to have to visit shady dudes in the projects, pretend to be friends with people I despise, go to clubs I don&#039;t want to go to.&nbsp; I just want my shit, and I&#039;ll decided the how, when&#039;s and where&#039;s.<br /><br />If there was ever an argument for decriminalisation, SR is it.<br /><br />So, really, this is my positive experience.&nbsp; Enhancing and enriching my life - as well as having a whole heap of fun - thanks to SR!&nbsp; No harm, no foul, much fun.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t that what life is all about?

				SR eliminated the need for sketchy clearnet vendors peddling RCs at outrageous prices. Getting to experience all these chemicals would just be a dream.<br />&nbsp;The idea just makes sense. People who won&#039;t risk their money on anything less than a (near) complete secure method. <br />

				If you wanna buy drugs you&#039;re gonna eventually - where else can you be assured that the dealer isn&#039;t gonna rip u off/stab u in the face, and their product is of a certain quality?<br /><br />If only street/unknown dealers had ratings, feedback and a forum where they and their product was discussed and reviewed!<br /><br />For those without fully trusted dealers this is perhaps the safest way to buy your drugs&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Long live SR!

				Weed is the only thing that&#039;s helped me control a stomach/digestive tract issue that is both humiliating and extremely limiting (think Crohn&#039;s disease.) Going on the Road, I can locate vendors who sell quality merchandise which is almost certainly not going to enrich gangs like the Zetas. Here in the US, local cops don&#039;t have to waste their time chasing small-time dope dealers, and the US postal service gets a much needed financial boost. Call me crazy, but I think the SR is an active force for good, and not just for me and my troublesome stomach.

				I also have a buyer account that I have bought pharmaceuticals under, and I am in love with SR. It sucks having to find this stuff out on the streets, it&#039;s way dangerous, and the dealers are usually hella flaky. I get the exact opposite experience when buying from SR. The vendors are very nice and very helpful. Quick turn around times, and the prices!!! I can&#039;t find some of the stuff I buy on the streets for EVEN CLOSE to the price I get for it on SR. Example: $5 a pill on the street but only $.60 cents on SR. Omg I fell in love in no time. It&#039;s a shame that us users are forced to risk our freedom and lives just to do something that is our right to do! Thanks to SR, and bitcoin, being able to order from the comfort of home, I can&#039;t even praise the site enough!!! I will be here for as long as SR is up and running!

However, when I started smoking weed, I felt like my life wasn&#039;t on autopilot anymore. I still deal with bouts of depression, but overall, I&#039;m happy I was introduced to marijuana. Now, I&#039;m at the point of my life when I know I have to stop smoking marijuana (as much) and focus on continuing to build the foundation for the rest of my adult life.

				The Silk Road enabled me to get my hands on LSD again for the first time since 2008 (four years). It&#039;s easy to get caught up in life and to feel that things are serious and tough, but to me LSD highlights the highly subjective and illusory nature of things. Tripping is always good fun, but I went for a record dose (though knowing the ug of a tab is hard, I&#039;d say a ten strip is usually a solid dose), and had an experience where I just revelled in the fact that humans have such capacity for happiness. It&#039;s not often one finds oneself with tears in ones eyes, all brought on by joy, but that&#039;s what I experienced, and I&#039;ve had a solid afterglow since then (something like 3-4 weeks, now). <br /><br />I love that the Silk Road is defiantly plugging away, insisting that people govern their own bodies. Middle finger up to the establishment!

				When I heard about SR I pounced. I&#039;ve wanted to do acid for years now but don&#039;t know any dealers so I&#039;ve been stymied. I was thrilled to find a place like this where I could not only buy what I wanted but also connect with others sharing similar interests. <br /><br />SR was the conduit for some awesome conversations and now experiences between my partner and me. I told her I intended to do acid again after many many years and she was nervous because she only really knew about what you hear in the media.&nbsp; As we talked, I learned so much about myself and why I was so interested in doing LSD again.<br /><br />Then I did find the right dealer (shout out mahakala!) who hooked me up with some fabulous candies and I tripped nicely on one. I chatted with a dear friend throughout the trip and got closer to my friend in ways we hadn&#039;t been able to before. Last weekend my partner even took a trip! The first time for her. It was intense and not that positive for her but it didn&#039;t turn her off, she can totally see how it would be positive and even wants to try it again with me as a sitter.<br /><br />As for me, I&#039;m looking forward to a larger trip I&#039;m going to take this Saturday. I&#039;ve been planing it out because it means something to me. LSD not just a drug, it&#039;s also an experience and a bridge to wider vistas. I&#039;m going to have my partner with me, I&#039;ll be chatting with my friend some, we&#039;re going to do some reading, it&#039;s going to be a whole range of experiences, sensual and mental.<br /><br />And don&#039;t get me started about the hash-oil brownies we&#039;ve become addicted to!&nbsp; ;D

				Beautiful stories fellows.&nbsp; *hugs*<br /><br />It&#039;s rather saddening that our government has taken our liberty away to experience life in its full spectrum with the help of various chemicals that the life has availed to us.<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it.&nbsp; Life can suck balls at times.&nbsp; Many things found on SR can help us through our rough patches or just open up our eyes into new dimension of reality we would have never experienced otherwise.

				Silkroad is giving&nbsp; the hope of living a productive life.I live in a small town and have been suffering horrible pain for a couple of years.Every doctor I&#039;ve seen here thinks that I am&nbsp; a drugseeker.Only now have appointments been made for me to see the proper specialists but in the meantime the quality of my life has taken a drastic downturn.Here on silkroad I can get the medication I need to keep me comfortable enough to work and clean my house.It&#039;s a fucking godsend.

				Ugh, I wonder, why people are always blaming the governments and the media? When really what should be questioned is the way of capitalism. I&#039;m a bit sophomoric here, but I can follow certain logic. The mass-media will never, EVER, write something good about SR, because it simply wouldn&#039;t sell. Let&#039;s have a test right here, which of the following has more of an appeal on a cover, this:&quot;Website selling lethal drugs, fake IDs and 100 things more illegal.&quot; or &quot;A wonderful place where one can buy (illegal) drugs and communicate with others.&quot; The latter wouldn&#039;t get as much attention as the first. Attention = money, money = capitalism. Blame our way of life, not the things that make it possible. As the saying goes, &quot;don&#039;t hate the player, hate the game!&quot;<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I have been a medical cannabis user for over 15 years for neurological pain. If left unchecked, the pain is so severe that it affects my ability to hold down a job and be a functional member of society. I moved to a new town in a new state where I knew absolutely nobody, and even after a few years I have only met a small handful of people who smoke, none of whom are able to supply me regularly for a variety of reasons. My quality of life has improved dramatically after discovering SR, with a steady supply of medicine I have been having solid weeks without pain, something that was rare with no access to medicine. I still have hope in my heart that it will be legalized within my lifetime (although, let&#039;s be real, my parents had the same dream go unfulfilled in their lifetimes), but even if it is legal I will continue to use SR because of the community and its emphasis on safety and quality.

				I&#039;m big into my downers by default, heroin and benzos. But love a good shot of meth or cocaine with it, even ritalin. Trouble is where I&#039;m from, while the heroin is all pure (it&#039;s produced here, so you buy it straight from the manufacturer or make it yourself) there&#039;s no cocaine and meth is expensive if you buy in small amounts. So the road is a good chance to have access to things we can&#039;t get locally. Cocaine, amphetamine sulphate (used to be big here, but meth has killed it)<br /><br />Also like the cheap benzos on here and some of the rarer stuff. I&#039;ve even bought some Heminevrin (Keith Moon Killers) which is rare as fuck. No way in hell I&#039;d have ever tried it without SR

				I&#039;ve been on the Road for over a year, newbie to the forums but a long time lurker.<br /><br />SR has been nothing short of a miracle for me, I still cannot imagine after many transactions and $2K+, that it exists. Clearly showcases human ingenuity. Kudos to the creators and the community! Long live the Road.<br /><br />Now for the positive story. I came here looking for LSD because all my local sources had dried up for a year, and I had been going through the roughest patch of my life. Luckily got a couple of legit stamps and it literally turned my life around on its head. Went from living a terrible depression and smoking 6 joints a day to being sober for 6 months with regular exercise, excellent work habits and a curiosity that never ends. Of course I attribute all this to LSD, but without the Road I would still be sulking in the corner of a smoke filled room wondering how the human condition is a pain in the ass.<br /><br />

				How has the silk road enriched my life? <br /><br />Its made the most well-stocked &quot;recreational pharmacist&quot; in the whole of where i live. You have no idea how good it feels to a) honestly tell soon to be customers you can get them DMT/Acid/Quartz MDMA by the multiple gram etc etc<br />and also b) support my life in a surreally honest sort of way - i can make 360 quid profit over a couple of weeks, keeping me fed and letting me visit relatives, meaning i dont need a job when my degree is such a busy one, whilst at the same time working for no shitty middle men or getting caught up in any of that dodgy shit. Self employment is bliss...<br /><br /><br />Cant deny the stash the SR has allowed me to get is just beautiful to just look at.<br />As is going out on 4 different otherwise rare chemicals just cos you can, SO easily. <br /><br />But dont publicise the SR!! i feel the way im doing it is better for the silk road than getting newbies involved who&#039;ll contribute to a less reliable market as sellers will be weary of them. Support the silk road by selling stuff you buy off of it, keeping the vendors in business and the SR cosy and reliable :)

				If you&#039;re in the professional world, it can be really hard to find anyone who will admit to or who is down for any recreational drug use. I went many years without knowing anyone who even smoked weed much less anyone who was into MDMA, H, etc. SR is a godsend to people like me who lack the connections to get into the delightful mischief that substances can provide.

				I found a prescription med that I need on a daily basis, as a matter of life and death, for WAY cheaper than the best prices you can get in a pharmacy as an uninsured person. And since nobody&#039;s asking me for a prescription I can stock up so I don&#039;t have to basically ask a doctor to give me permission to live a while longer every few months. Looking forward to peace of mind, independence from the government/medical/insurance complex, and a bit of financial breathing room thanks to Silk Road!

Literally.&nbsp; I suspect that there are many on SR just like us who grow up and simply lose contact with anyone that could supply us with anything. I&#039;ve talked about it with close friends and they were just as at a loss as we were on how to find anyone or approach anyone else to find simple things like pot or shrooms. I had grown some shrooms a few years ago for our own use and it was a modest success but a lot of work and we had a child in the intervening years so we basically stopped all production in the house in the run up to me getting pregnant.<br /><br />Finding SR has enabled my husband and I to have enriched experiences together that we would not be able to have given our current lifestyle in a safe and meaningful way. I am in a comfortable job with no drug testing and this enables us to partake of pot that was unavailable 20 years ago. I find pot more stress relieving than any pill prescribed by any doctor.&nbsp; We&#039;ve now had 3 mushroom trips in just as many months (literally going away on a long weekend without the child and tripping on shrooms) and each of these experiences has brought us closer as a couple then we have felt in years. In short - SR has enabled us to live the life we WANT to live not the life we HAVE to live due to prohibition.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even been able to share some of my new booty with my close friends who otherwise had been at a loss. Now they are happy and content as well.<br /><br />Thank you to my vendors for being so discreet and having competitive pricing as well as good reviews both on SR and the boards.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />LOVE, love, love, love this.&nbsp; :-*

				SilkRoad offers me an outlet for fantastic times with the assurance I&#039;d never get IRL. What the media chooses to ignore is that this is by far the safest and most secure option for such purchases, compared to dealing with untrustworthy dealers on the streets that will sell you whatever, without a care in the world. However, here on SilkRoad, it&#039;s the opposite, and if a scammer comes to fruition, they are quickly dealt with. The selection of products available is first class, as we&#039;re not dealing with a local marketplace, we&#039;re dealing with a global marketplace, which makes SilkRoad a lot more competitive. SilkRoad is the place that empowers people like myself to have the choice of what we put into our bodies, and do it in the most safest and knowledgeable way possible.<br /><br />SilkRoad has not only enriched my life, it has changed it for the better, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not alone in feeling this way, my life would not be the same without it. Thank-you SilkRoad :)

				My story: I have had clinical depression for years, and I have been on SSRI&#039;s for a long time now. However, even though I am taking a pretty high dosage of anti-depressants, I rarely feel like they are of any help. Plus I am too lazy and skeptical of getting a prescription for any anti-depressants that are more effective than the Cipralexes I am taking at the moment. So, I have instead turned to illict drugs of all kind, opiates, stimulants and weed. So far, they have provided me with more comfort than the legally-prescribed SSRI&#039;s. Silk Road has been my main channel for acquiring those drugs and I have forged some really good relationships with a handful of vendors who sell me those drugs. They have proved to be really fantastic people who provide me with a lot of drugs that give me strength to get through the daily grind. Thank you Silk Road!

				As many of you know, finding good quality drugs on the REAL streets is hit and miss at best. Especially when it comes to powders, you can never be sure of what you&#039;re getting and the prices are usually pretty unsatisfactory. SR completely changes the game. Not only are there hundreds of reviewers to tell you what you&#039;re getting before you get it, there are also plenty of people with reagent tests who can actually confirm that whats being sold is legitimate. It is for that reason that I love the SR.

				Well thanks to a new seller (Novartis) I finally have access to all the emergency medicine I need. I&#039;m talking things like epinephrine, diphenhydramine injection, Narcan, etc... I&#039;m a trained and nationally registered EMT and its absolutely ridiculous that I cannot have legal access to these medicine (only EMT-Paramedics and above can carry most drugs). Since I&#039;ve been an EMT I&#039;ve witnessed 2 overdoses, 1 of which the person died before the medic could get there and the other was very close, and someone very close to me suffered minor but still significant brain damage from lack of oxygen due to anaphylaxis following an allergic reaction. If I was carrying Narcan, diphenhydramine injection, and epinephrine I could have drastically changed the outcome of these situations.<br /><br />In short, SR has enabled me to prepare myself to face these situation again. The next time I witness an overdose or allergic reaction, no one has to die.<br /><br />Even if you are buying recreational drugs for personal use, SR is still a godsend. The more people that buy their drugs on SR, the less drug-related violence on the streets, the less overdoses and poisonings (because you have a much better idea of what you are getting). This makes it safer for both drug users, law enforcement, and innocent bystanders alike. Law enforcement needs to realize that the majority of the people buying their drugs on SR are the &quot;responsible&quot; drug users, those that just want to enjoy their drug of choice int he safest way possible without effecting anyone else.

				I was reading the above post about an EMT looking to have life saving meds on hand to help people in need. Just wanted to say that is fucking awesome and I hope I have people with that mindset close to me should I ever be in a position of life and death...<br /><br />That said... I must say that having discovered SR has made me feel like less of an outcast/isolated case of a recreational drug user just looking for quality and reliability and more like a member of a steadily growing following of people willing to openly cast off the myths of recreational drug use and offer support and info to each other. I think that&#039;s awesome and revolutionary especially in a world where oppressive governments are getting WAY out of control. I&#039;ve always held that doing right by others will come back to you, and this network of people is solid proof. I&#039;ve had a chance to do alot of reading in the forums. I think they are awesome, fun, insightful and informative... Anyways, see you all on the Silk Road!!

				I have been pretty devoid emotionally throughout my entire life, and I&#039;ve learned for the most part to cope with it but the entire thing had left me pretty lacking when it comes to genuine empathy/sympathy. I mean, I would talk to people and act concerned for their shit but really it just went in one ear and out the other. Then in college I met a friend who introduced me to empathogens and psychedelics, in particular the 2c&#039;s and methylone. <br /><br />I did these for a while sparingly and found that doing M1 every now and then really boosts my mood, has very few negative side effects, and leaves me with a genuine empathy and feel for the situations around me that I didn&#039;t have before. It&#039;s really helped me out more than anything has before. <br /><br />I got out of contact with the friend of mine and eventually found SR, which ( even though money&#039;s tight for me nowadays and it&#039;s hard to make the money for any purchases nowadays ) has made it simple to find the compounds that I feel help me regulate my mood and make me, in general, a better, more feeling person. <br /><br />Also, when I order from SR, I know exactly what I&#039;m getting and the feedback system allows me to not put myself in a risky situation. The anonymity of the entire thing protects me from dealers who in the real world could very much take advantage of me ( I&#039;m a smaller guy, pretty lanky and never been in a fight myself aside from a few scraps in early grade school ) which is a wonderful thing.<br /><br />And since you&#039;re going to buy what you&#039;re going to buy, there isn&#039;t that pressure to go out and do something you wouldn&#039;t want to do. I&#039;ve done a few drugs that I regret out of peer pressure, although now I realize they weren&#039;t so bad. At the time though, it was a major source of dissonance for me because I was just doing it because I thought people would judge me for not doing it. There&#039;s nothing like that here.<br /><br />Added to that the wonderful forum community and commitment to harm reduction and drug safety that most of the users on here have, and you&#039;ve just got a recipe for goodness... This site has done wonders for me, and I&#039;m glad that it&#039;s helped other people too.

				Alright, well here goes it. I kind of pop in and out of depression from here and there. Sometimes have some self-esteem.&nbsp; I found cocaine really helped with that.&nbsp; I know people think that&#039;s a bad road to go down, but it really wasn&#039;t for me.&nbsp; Just allowed me to be more confident and really kind of believe in myself.&nbsp; It never became a problem and it just used to done as a pick me up at parties at the bar.&nbsp; Then it got to the point where I can&#039;t find any clean coke out here.&nbsp; Shit just feels right away but then leaves with that shitty tweaked out, heart-pounding, can&#039;t sleep, kinda nauseous bullshit. <br /><br />So I stopped doing it.&nbsp; Just wasn&#039;t worth it anymore with how shitty I would feel for days after.&nbsp; So my confidence hasn&#039;t gone back in tank, but I have some mild self-esteem issues that still manifest themselves from time to time.&nbsp; And plus I just kinda like to get fucked up on the weekends.&nbsp; It eases.&nbsp; I know this is self-medicating talk but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s bad thing here. <br /><br />Long story short, I&#039;m glad I&#039;ve found a place where I&#039;m able to purchase cocaine and potentially have to worry about the shitty, speedy comedown, or barring that, score some benzos and keep them handy for when I am indulging and need a little calming influence.<br /><br />Gotta also say, the knowledge of the members of this site is amazing.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor but I&#039;d really like to find ways to be involved in the community.&nbsp; SWIM may have relevant schooling background if anyone needs legal tips or anything.&nbsp; I&#039;m always open to PMs and whatnot.

				I do enjoy taking some things recreationally, mainly weed every couple weeks on a friday night and a bit of mandy and speed three or four times a year. SR has been the best thing ever for a person like me, because as I&#039;ve gotten older, the stuff I get seems to get weaker and more expensive as I don&#039;t have those solid connections anymore. Weed has never been a problem, but most of my friends are like me and we don&#039;t go out raging all the time, but I do love to blow off some steam every now and then. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always had the feeling though that this can&#039;t last forever, so I&#039;ve definitely got enough stuff put aside to at least last me the next couple years. I love this place.

				I love SR.<br /><br />SR made me and about 50 friends of mine lives safer and better. <br /><br />Before SR: Me and my friends would obtain psychedelics rarely and dangerously often being sold fake drugs.&nbsp; Including one story of 5 of my friends taking DOX when they thought it was LSD tripped for over 18 hours. Estascy was hard to get a hold of except at raves where I think the first time I told E I took Meth or Piperzine staying up until 3pm the next day.<br /><br />After SR: The only psychedelics and MDMA that I know of is coming from SR in my area except for at raves.&nbsp; Other sellers are laughed at now a days because of the quality of products coming through here.&nbsp; More people I know are trying MDMA safety and loving every second of it.&nbsp; Being at a rave with around 40 of my friends rolling and telling me they love me and how I made everything possible is the greatest feeling in the world, espcially while rolling :). <br /><br />Because of my access of these drugs my personality has changed, I&#039;ve becoming more confident from my use of MDMA, and more content with life because of my use of psychedelics.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been buying these for the money at all, just to make me and my friends lives better, and it sure has. <br />Thank you SR.

				Before SR I only had 2-3 guys I could get weed from and it was always a pain to find. I was drinking alcohol to medicate and it was getting pretty bad, lot&#039;s of hard liquor. It was hard to quit without something to medicate, so when I ran out of weed I would always go back to alcohol. I found a short term hookup and managed to quit drinking for a few months, and then I found SR. I&#039;ve been sober for over a year now and there is no going back. Even when i don&#039;t have weed I still don&#039;t want to drink, it feels like I really accomplished something.<br /><br />Having a safe and secure place to buy drugs is a life saver. I certainly don&#039;t miss having to interact with the shadiest of people, not a big fan of guns being pulled on me.

				Greetings!<br /><br />Very short story about me and drugs. All of this happened after my graduated in university. <br /><br />I found weed one year ago. This moment was something like a first people on the Moon. This &quot;discover day&quot; was totally life changing day to better life. Now I&#039;m more communicative, happier, I&#039;ve got a new job, I&#039;ve began reading books a lot, world is more accessible, I want to do a lot of things now because weed opened my mind and gives me new senses. It&#039;s complicated to describe it because the words is nice but really austere. My soul feels nice and my body feels it too!<br /><br />Now I want to try psychedelic. I firmly believe it gives me door to knowledge, I want to open this doors. <br /><br />Camo

				Honestly, the road has been great to me. I was getting clean from all substances but mainly opiates and SR allowed me to get a low dose of K. It helped me out. I am sober. I&#039;ve been getting back in the gym and found some great vendors with quality pharm steroids. This stuff gives me the motivation to hit the gym and get healthy. I take it in responsible doses and take all precautions necessary ie doctor, blood work etc... It&#039;s also a wonderful community of people providing a supplement to entertainment for their weekends after a long week of work or school.

Since I&#039;ve been an EMT I&#039;ve witnessed 2 overdoses, 1 of which the person died before the medic could get there and the other was very close, and someone very close to me suffered minor but still significant brain damage from lack of oxygen due to anaphylaxis following an allergic reaction. If I was carrying Narcan, diphenhydramine injection, and epinephrine I could have drastically changed the outcome of these situations.<br /><br />In short, SR has enabled me to prepare myself to face these situation again. The next time I witness an overdose or allergic reaction, no one has to die.<br /><br />Even if you are buying recreational drugs for personal use, SR is still a godsend. The more people that buy their drugs on SR, the less drug-related violence on the streets, the less overdoses and poisonings (because you have a much better idea of what you are getting). This makes it safer for both drug users, law enforcement, and innocent bystanders alike. Law enforcement needs to realize that the majority of the people buying their drugs on SR are the &quot;responsible&quot; drug users, those that just want to enjoy their drug of choice int he safest way possible without effecting anyone else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 for this, just came across this post and can&#039;t thank you enough for the kind words. In addition to helping many friends, it feels good to help a community like this like we help those in need in real life who lack decent insurance or happen to make a mistake that could potentially cost them their lives.<br />Thank you!

				SR has made me want to live again! Seriously with all our freedoms being taken away from us bit by bit it has been a literal life-saver. It just feels so natural and right to be able to buy and share, discuss and learn from each other and reclaim a lot of lost time. It had been a very hard year but finding SR has drastically improved the quality of my life and the lives of all those around me..God, it feels like I&#039;m home finally! I&#039;ll stop gushing now but thanks to all!

				I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been said but I&#039;ll say it again -- Quality. Guaranteed quality. No running around to 10 different people, who all say their shit is 100 percent pure and strong, with not only no way to confirm their claims but nobody else to turn to if their product is shitty. <br />The stereotypical dealer is repulsive to me, and having to ask anyone for drugs that I don&#039;t know is just not the best idea sometimes. <br />I do what a lot of people do; buy and resell. But beyond that I maintain a reputation of quality. Since I&#039;ve started seriously purchasing from SR, I&#039;ve made around 100-150 sales. Not a single person has every claimed I had bunk material. In fact the comments are almost always the complete opposite -- that I&#039;ve mis-measured my doses or that I must have mistakenly given them LSD instead of 25c because it&#039;s so intense for the user. <br /><br />That&#039;s really what it all boils down to for me, because if an area has no access to the drug or such little access that the end product is cut down and barely there at all... well price won&#039;t matter if you can get the &quot;real&quot; shit. Know what I mean? Incidentally, I got a call from someone offering me &quot;heady blotter&quot; with no idea on dosage. They claim 100micrograms but I think they just pulled that figure out of thin air. Anyway I only bought 2 hits to see if it&#039;s the real deal. Ehrlich test will show me the truth. <br />

				A good and important topic. I&#039;ll just start with the general and move towards specific. First of all SR has taught me that while I may feel like an outcast and leper, there are many like-minded folk here who reinforce my view that exogenous substances unavailable thru legal channels may actually improve your life. But not necessarily. People an make very stupid choices yet still get help here,<br /><br />Also between here and Erowid, folks can make a much more informed choice re the substance&nbsp; and what to expect. It is one thing to read everything available on say LSD yet have no idea whether the product available on the streets comes anywhere close to being authentic--more threads should emulate the LSD avengers.<br /><br />On a more personal note, SR has reawakened my interest in music, has expanded my knowledge of politics and computer science, and made me a better teacher.&nbsp; As my daughters mature, this may be the most impotrant thing I can pass down.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Third--that I had an epiphany a few weeks back as I was coming down form a great LSD adventure, this is the stuff of revolution. Not SR by itself--the magic is in the cryptocurrency. I seriously doubt nation states like we have now will exist&nbsp; execpt as shadows 50 years from now.

				The road enriched my life because now I have safer access to high quality marijuana which I need on a daily basis. I also met a girl name Molly, introduced to me by UGS (Great Vendor). Molly literally cured my PTSD, I feel more free and in control than I have in a long time. <br /><br />I would like to see all drugs decriminalized and taxed, and for all the revenue to go toward education and treatment. That, I believe, is a very real solution to any country with a drug epidemic. I have used drugs for fifteen years, sometimes abusively, sometimes moderately. In my older age I can moderate a lot better than I could when I was younger, and thats great. For so long I thought I was doomed to die with a needle in my arm, actually ever since I first lit up marijuana thats what they all said. But here I am, the more experience I have the safer and more responsible my drug use becomes and I want to see that happen to my fellow junkies as well, as opposed to them being abused by police, abused in a prison, and possibly having their lives destroyed for something that is simply genetic, un-curable at the moment, and in some cases just not their fault. <br /><br />So long live SR and many thanks to you all, my life has truly been enriched by the road and I am always so pleased to see such level headed, responsible, thought out, advice and opinions from the members of this community. Sincerely, -thedopestjunkie.

				I&#039;d just like to say a few things:<br /><br />1.) I recently just turned 18 years old and I am still in high school. I feel I am more sophisticated than most people I come across. Probably the number 1 thing I like about SR is the forums because the members are usually also very sophisticated and there are a lot of people on here that are willing to help you. They try to help you even if a ask a dumb question. I love to help&nbsp; people as well so I love being treated the way I treat others. Also, obviously Silk Road is remote and anonymous but I sort of get a feeling of belonging to a big family when I&#039;m on here even though I am not well known or anywhere close to it.<br /><br />2.) SR makes the purchase of drugs better and safer. I feel buying them from other people is sketchy and also unsafe as you don&#039;t know at all what you&#039;re getting. You just have to rely on what others say which can be complete bullshit. On SR, you don&#039;t know 100% what you&#039;re getting but if you choose to do research on the vendor and what others&#039; experiences were like with them and their product, you can come pretty close to knowing 100% of what you&#039;re getting.<br /><br />Just wanted to give you my two cents on Silk Road.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />HighAllDay96<br /><br />Luke

				In short, I like the community. I&#039;ve learned a lot. It&#039;s good to know that there are like-minded people out there, good to have a place where we can talk openly and frankly about subtance use and abuse. Drugs are a complicated topic--impacts on the body, brain, politics, behavior, crime... w/r/t my overall view on drugs, I&#039;m still sometimes anti-, still sometimes pro-, still sometimes agnostic, but I do feel like I have a deeper understanding of&nbsp; the realities how drug use works and why people do what they do.

				I moved from a medical MJ state to the southeast side of hell....SR has helped me gain access to the safe MMJ, psychiatric &amp; pain meds i have no access to here, they cut my insurance so I can&#039;t afford to go see therapist for my PTSD(I had a nervous breakdown) or afford going to pain management for the little bit of pain meds i need to help me manage my nerve pain from my open heart surgery i had less than 2years ago...all because a few others my age have abused the system? I have no record for drug sales or usage but I get the 3rd degree everytime I go to er in pain which has only happened 2x since being here so it&#039;s not like i&#039;d be in the system for dr shopping. I was in a very low &amp; depressed place(because of no MJ to be found on street) when a RPG friend told me about SR, He placed the first order for me on his account until i could get bitcoins &amp; everything set up on my extra laptop. My life has changed so much since then! I&#039;m more myself a, got a hold of my business again &amp; started back enjoying my life....My mother has been able to quit drinking as thanks to the abundance of MMJ &amp; affordable detox drugs on&nbsp; SR...Even with access to all kinds of drugs, I&#039;m never greedy,&nbsp; I only buy the things i need thank goodness for this new precious resource I&#039;m lucky enough to be have access to &amp; be able to afford it. yesterday I had a wake &amp; bake with my mother &amp; went shopping with MMJ &amp; coupons bought on SR &amp; that was the first time we really had fun together in my life1 Thanks SR

				<br />It has given me wonderful potent clean chems to take the edge off when needed and help me put things into perspective. This life gets too hectic sometimes. I also feel the wonderful selection of trippy trips sold here give the brain a re-boot, or shakes the cobwebs out. <br /><br />For all this I am grateful. It has improved my attitude personally and professionally. Definitely helps me to connect with my fellow man and have more care in situations that I usually do not. <br /><br />AND has given me cat-like reflexes. But that&#039;s a whole nother story! lol

				For one, I do substantially less drugs now that I have this access. <br /><br />IRL, I have noticed an inclination to buy almost whatever came across my path, if only for fear of not being able to find anything else...ever?...i don&#039;t know...it was a bit of a hording instinct I reckon. Even a substance I wasn&#039;t particularly into, I would feel compelled to at least get a little bit for a rainy day. There&#039;s none of that now. Similar to the way I practically stopped drinking the day after I turned 21, rarity and novelty are taken way out of the equation. Access has not overwhelmed me, but almost the opposite. This is not to say I don&#039;t love my drugs. We&#039;re just at a different place in our relationship.<br /><br /><br />The drugs I do now are easily better on average, if not across the board, making me even less prone to picking up some random junk I may come upon in the streets.<br /><br />Speaking of streets, I have been doing exponentially less driving and or riding in suspect vehicles with my suspended license. In fact almost none. To and from work...about 5 minutes each way. No trips to anywhere unknown to risk arousing the attentions of any law enforcement professionals that might be lurking maliciously in some cutaway, just waiting to ruin my night/week/life by saving me from myself, and the world from me.<br /><br />Along with my SR usage has come a marked increase in my cyber awareness and security as well, and I think we all know how valuable that is, and will increasingly be. <br /><br />I have a much friendlier relationship with my mailman for sure. I got him a card for xmas. He&#039;s the best. <br /><br />all in all, its a beautiful thing IMO

				I like trying new compounds that I have never tried before. I can literally fill a piece of paper with all the different compounds I&#039;ve taken. For example, prior to SR temazepam was particularly hard for me to come by given my previous resource had expired due to the death of a celeb whom shared a name with our site. Nevertheless it turned out to be a good thing. Also I recently had the privilege of doing 2cb. And it was fantastic given I hadn&#039;t tripped in over 11 months since!

				I&#039;ve enjoyed being able to try compounds I would NEVER have been able to find otherwise, such as the 2C family, mescaline. I also like being able to get painkillers when I need them and not getting the 3rd degree from a doc. Also, since I am predominantly a pothead, I can get really good pot within 3-6 days in some cases.<br />Someone mentioned on one of the first couple of pp. of this post about playing around with banking - that&#039;s kind of fun &amp; challenging at times - where to get bitcoins &amp; what-not.<br />The book club bit is great, have yet to read the same books at the same time.<br />Lastly, but maybe most important to me is being able to talk about drug use without being judged or ratted out - VERY appreciative of that...<br />&nbsp;

				I can buy clean, high quality dope with no exposure whatsoever to shady characters on street corners - and this to me is perhaps the most significant improvement in my drug using career. Having lived in the Netherlands I do know what it is to be relatively safe from law enforcement when buying and even consuming drugs, but the process of buying on SR has made law enforcement irrelevant, as it should be, when the question of consuming drugs for recreational purposes arises.<br /><br />It has transformed my life. I can now go about my business without worrying where to score and so on. Further, I do think that the fact the SR exists and the sky has patently not fallen in is itself a great blow agains the War On Some Drugs. <br /><br />In other news, the eagerly anticipated documentary on the drug war - &#039;The House I Live In&#039;&nbsp; - is to be screened tomorrow night on BBC4. I can&#039;t wait to see this. Especially since, thanks to SR, I shall be stoned immaculate whilst so doing :D

				I have not made my first order yet... but silkroad has become the silver lining behind the dark cloud that hangs over purchasing goodies. It takes the danger of getting into an altercation with a dealer out of drug buying. It also gives education on on proper usage, safe habits, and good info on quality so you know what you are buying.

				Urgency-- the &quot;gotta have it&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />For many years I was fascinated with drugs, but I&#039;m not the kind of person who knows how to find drugs locally.&nbsp; I know a few people who smoke pot, but none of them know where or how to get things like LSD.&nbsp; I always felt this great urgency to jump at any opportunity to get some if they became available-- because I knew that I would most likely never have the chance again in my lifetime.&nbsp; When I found SR, I was amazed that it was even possible!&nbsp; To quote from a Stephen King book, &quot;It was like being given control of the moon and the tides.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the first orders I made was for acid blotter.&nbsp; It had lots of reviews, so I knew exactly what I was getting.&nbsp; It was a wonderful experience-- far beyond anything I could have imagined from reading trip reports.&nbsp; I loved it, and I would do it again, but that urgency is gone.&nbsp; I know what it is about, so I can just let it be.&nbsp; <br /><br />The same goes for other, harder drugs-- methamphetamine and opiates hold such a special place in our culture.&nbsp; We villify them and bloat their reputation simultaneously.&nbsp; They are notoriously dramatized in the media, and that made me want to try them.<br /><br />So I got some from SR.&nbsp; It was like opening Pandora&#039;s Box.&nbsp; I tried all the hard stuff, even the dissociatives. And now the pull of their weighty reputation has faded.&nbsp; If I had been offered any of these things through a street dealer, I would have felt strongly compelled to do it, because it&#039;s such a rare opportunity for someone like me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet now that I can have all of it again, anytime I want, I&#039;m not as interested anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sure, I understand the attraction, and I get inside jokes from Spun and Breaking Bad, Fear and Loathing and all those, but it&#039;s certainly not the earth-shattering experience that the media makes it out to be.<br /><br />This has been such a relief!&nbsp; The &#039;power&#039; of this mystery has greatly diminished now that it&#039;s no longer an unknown.&nbsp; A couple of times a month I still order something or other, because I like that thrill of seeing a package in the mailbox and knowing something special is inside of it.&nbsp; It&#039;s like getting a Christmas present.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the gravity of it is gone.<br /><br />I am incredibly grateful that SR exists, because it gave me the opportunity to do all the drugs I want in a private, controlled setting, in (relative) anonymity, in safety and without having to leave my home or involve anyone I personally know.&nbsp; I tell no one about it and for a few months it was my secret life-- this amazing, impossible secret I carry around in my heart.&nbsp; But the novelty of even that has begun to deflate like a balloon.&nbsp; Once all the hot air is taken out of it, it becomes clear that there&#039;s really not much to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The community here on the forums has also been amazing, because I am able to talk about my drug adventures, things I&#039;ve carried for so long, and see that soooo many other people have similar thoughts and experiences.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could do another huge post about this, too, but I&#039;ll save that for another day.<br /><br />Thank you SR, DPR and all others who have made this possible.&nbsp;

				1. Clean and uncut recreational drugs from the Road makes the street safer for kids and addicts alike.<br /><br />2. The Road provides a wide arrangement of recreational drugs available to researchers and academics for Science.<br /><br />3. Anonymous drug purchases keeps drug dealers off the streets and out of sight, which increases property values in certain neighborhoods.<br /><br />4. The Road provides a safer and cleaner outlet for one of biggest taboos of the &quot;Great Society,&quot; and a public forum for safe, sane, and consensual discussion of such taboos.<br /><br />5. Money for starving college students!<br /><br />EDIT: correcting grammar.

				I could always get most drugs sold here anyhow, the beauty of SR is the choice!<br /><br />For example, anyone can get cocaine in the UK - ask any 14 yr old riding a stolen mountain bike wearing a mountaineerig coat (with the hood up) and - bing! - you got coke, maybe 5-10%, but hey!<br /><br />Also, what I like here is the information and the drug harm reduction advice.<br /><br />Better to be upfront over that. Its no use arguing drugs are safe as houses - they are IF you take a test dose first (some people are allergic to MDMA for example) and KNOW you doses!<br /><br />Also, buy a decent set of scales!<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />PS - a report soon on 70ug of LSD odd subtickle and some old Ivory MDMA - 100mg. Wow! I mean, whoa!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Folks the honest to goodness truth is that SR has helped me decrease my usage of drugs and helped me see the light as far as drug use goes. Thank God for SR<br /><br />I been thru re habs and honestly they have served as a place to meet new connections for getting drugs. Same way as jail is a school for getting drugs and making your own drugs. SR is a real honest to goodness cure for my addictions. I think a big part of the thrill is the ability to be able to get these things. So if you throw it all at me at once like this then a big part of the thrill is gone.<br /><br />I love this community and hope to give back some how

				I&#039;ve found that SR has enabled me, in a semi-controlled environment, the ability to give things a try that I&#039;ve always been curious about.<br /><br />LSD was top of that list, having never been able to source it in the RW.<br /><br />Aside from that, being able to get some propper MDMA, has been a blessing. I love this stuff, and it&#039;s helping with my weight-loss.<br /><br />Furthermore, a regular supply of benzos (diazepam) has also helped me take control of my social anxiety disorder. <br /><br />Taking a couple a blues to overcome a crowded room, is a god send.<br /><br /><br />Long may SR continue.<br /><br />As long as people exercise good judgement, and is things in moderation, I can only think that SR is, for the most part, offering a great deal of help to a great many people.<br /><br /><br />Of course though, if you just wanna get off your face for the weekend, SR has that covered too. lol

				If I ever had kids, and my kids asked me about drugs, I would show them SR. I would trust SR with my children, but not street dealers.<br /><br /><br />With SR, you know with much greater certainty what you are getting, and I can teach my kids to respect drugs, and how to be responsible with them.<br /><br />For reasons alien to me, many 13-15 year olds on steam or skype tend to contact me out of nowhere, and ask me tough questions about sex, drugs, bdsm, fetishes, and other things.<br /><br />I answer those questions honestly, and try to keep them safe to the extent that I can. Kids are cool.<br /><br />Most of my adult friends hate kids, and think children are abhorrent, but I want kids one day. The fact that all these young teens look up to me, and trust my advice makes me feel warm inside.<br /><br />When they ask for a safe place to buy something, I refer them to SR, and give them a brief, concise lessons on how to connect, use openpgp, tor, and bitcoin, and links to some tutorials.<br /><br />It&#039;s better that my underaged friends buy here, where it is safe, then out on the street where they can get knifed, shot, mugged, or raped, or merely given poisonous cut drugs.

				Last year after a serious of hassling close friends (which is something I hate to do) and stressing waiting for text replies and wondering about cops I finally got put onto someone who had &#039;MDMA.&#039; I was so excited and after literally months of trying to track it down I wasn&#039;t phased by paying $30 a cap (Australia). I was put in contact with this guy by a friend of a friend who sells me weed sometimes (my first mistake was not using someone I trust) and figured the caps must be good if people are buying them. Boy was I wrong. I railed one at a party and about 10 minutes later I start feeling really cold, like I&#039;m freezing to death. My heart rate started climbing and climbing, I&#039;m hallucinating but not at all in a good way (lights from all angles are burning into my eyes), I feel terrible, dysphoric. I almost admit myself to hospital but lay down on the grass with my heart exploding in my chest, still freezing. <br /><br />I honestly believe that I nearly died from a relatively low dose. Later I found out that these caps were mixed with a much cheaper chemical called PMA/PMMA (street name &#039;death&#039;). I became so disillusioned with the drug world and depressed from this experience. That people care so much more for profit than other human beings. The silk road has completely restored my faith not only in drugs but in people altogether. Access to clean, safe chemicals even with harm minimization information available is a god send and is something that has the power to save lives (imagine if someone more adventurous than me took 2 caps, PMA has an exponential dose response curve.) So thanks for that sr.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been able to get the &#039;medication&#039; - OK - Drugs! That work for me. In my case, amphetamine in my late 40&#039;s, became a Godsend, especially since I hated stimulants of any kind, unless it was some energy drink to stay awake during some work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Diagnosed as Adult ADD. - There&#039;s all different clarifications. ADHD-Pi&nbsp; (primarily inattentive) Which was what I was told. - Doesn&#039;t &quot;primarily inattentive&quot; kind of get covered with &quot;attention deficit&quot;???<br /><br />Anyway, after a year of Ritalin, I started to think - nothing is ever going to work. It was this time my Dr stopped taking my insurance, that I went back to an old psychiatrist at a county hospital, where I was <br /><br />kept for a suicide thing. - Well he listened to me bitch about how &quot;nothing really works&quot;, then stopped my 3rd bitch session and said, &quot;What about adderall&quot;? - I said &quot;What about it?&quot; Another stim med?<br /><br />Well he convinced me it worked for people who Ritalin stops working for, and is indicated after 1 full year of Ritalin. - Well, the rest is history. I now know I probably had ADD my whole life. <br /><br />Was always told I had all this great potential, and IQ, etc. Yet I continue to screw off, and distract the class, and gravitate towards the troublemakers in class,, etc... Now I know. <br /><br />Had there been Adderall prescribed to kids back in the 70&#039;s +80&#039;s when I was in K-12 school, I probably wouldn&#039;t even be on this site. <br /><br />I found this site, because the amount of Adderall I required was above the adult male daily limit, which for the US is 60mg. ( 2 - 30mg&#039;s a day), - So I went searching for a way to &quot;supplement&quot; my &quot;government controlled&quot; rationing. - After getting it here and there from school age kids, and feeling kind of creepy, one college kid, told me about this site. <br /><br />That&#039;s where I started a year ago. Then I realized for the price of 1 - 30mg generic adderall pill. - currently anywhere from 15 to 25 American dollars. - I can get 1000mgs~! - ie; 1g. <br /><br />So my shrink retired. I no longer have to drive anywhere. I manage to find some trusted sources for the chemical that helps me tick, and keeps me from longing for a seat on the railroad tracks. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also done some firsts! - Tried Heroin. - Not wise, but hey, I really tried everything else. For some lucky reason, it didn&#039;t drive me back into the arms of prescription painkillers. I was told, &quot;just don&#039;t shoot it&quot;. - I listened. - Once every month or so, a nice 1/2 g or Gram, of some #3 or #4 H, snorted, maybe smoked for the rush. - Harmless, as long as you&#039;re careful of doses, and start with small amounts, if it&#039;s a new batch, to make sure you don&#039;t OD. - <br /><br />That, and other assorted benzos that aren&#039;t sold in the US yet, have been interesting. <br /><br />Trying pure opium proved challenging, though I managed. - The best so far, has been the &quot;Temple Ball&quot; - Opiated Hashish. - (usually 1 part opium to 4 parts hash)<br /><br />As far as hallucinogens go, I really did A LOT of quality acid back in the 70&#039;s + 80&#039;s, but I have gotten a few hits recently and stashed them away for a friend and I, when the time is right. <br /><br />All the MDMA&#039;s and the many other MDxx analogues or RC&#039;s (research chemicals) - That&#039;s for another generation. I&#039;ve tried a few here and there, and it just seemed like the bad side effects of cheap LSD or Mescaline, with no real &quot;trip&quot; or worthwhile feeling. <br /><br />Maybe I didn&#039;t do the right ones. <br /><br />But I&#039;m satisfied with what I&#039;ve done so far. - I&#039;ve gotten healthier. Since Amphetamine causes weight loss. - I never realized what a fat fuck I was! - Went from 240+ pounds, to around 170 pounds. - Just over 6 feet tall, that&#039;s where I should be. - I had hypertension, that is gone. - I had high cholesterol. - That is GONE. - No heart problems. When I eat, I make sensible choices. <br /><br />The only time I go back to unhealthy habits, is when I stop taking Amphetamine.<br /><br />Thank you Silk Road!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp;

But nothing seemed to work in the long run. <br /><br />Suicide WAS constantly on my mind, I just couldn&#039;t sleep with all the thoughts in my head for my failures in life, stuff I wish I did,etc.<br /><br />I said fuck it, let me take the plunge on SR,&nbsp; started reading more about mushrooms (which I always thought were extremely poisonous with all types of side effects). Come to find out they really aren&#039;t bad, we just have shithead politicians, horrible people that make laws and the pharma industry that leads it all. <br /><br />My biggest change in my life came when I ordered mushrooms from Galindoi. First time taking them was like a rush of happiness that lasted for hours.&nbsp; I was dumbfounded on how something that can make you happy is outlawed. The more I read about it, I decided to try<br />to treat my depression with it. <br /><br />In less than 3 weeks, I got rid of - heart palpitations, &quot;brain fog&quot; , shortness of breath when falling asleep, and I was getting random spurts of happiness through out the day. I couldn&#039;t believe in just 3 short weeks mushrooms helped me out that much. Do I still have a long way to go, you bet, BUT the mushrooms are now turning the gears in my brain trying to get me to fix the problems in my life rather than just coping with the problems like with anti-depressants. AND my personality changed for the better, I&#039;m more loving, starting to hate negativity, and am starting to be more social. <br /><br />I can imagine 6months-1 year of taking a tiny amount of mushrooms everyday like I have been doing will help me do more in 1 year than what I have been doing in the past 5 years. <br /><br />Depression is a killer..friends dismiss you, people look down on you, working,concentration is hard and so on. Life&#039;s short, and I just want to be happy. People like Galindoi and others are considered bad mean drug dealers by the law and I think that&#039;s so sad. I don&#039;t even know them and they have helped me more than anything in my life and theres no way I can ever be thankful enough to them. <br /><br />We really need more education on substances like mushrooms and lsd. It&#039;s amazing how smart we can be as people and then so dumb.&nbsp;
