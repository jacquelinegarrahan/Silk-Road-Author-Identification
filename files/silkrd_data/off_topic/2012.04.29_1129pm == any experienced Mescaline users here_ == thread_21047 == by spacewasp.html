				I&#039;m just wondering if anyone can give a good description of mescaline and what makes it unique.&nbsp; I have a pretty decent amount of experience with lsd, psilocybin, salvia, rc&#039;s, dmt....but mescalito is one of the few plant spirits I don&#039;t know intimately.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken san pedro a couple times, but never tripped hard enough to really meet the spirit behind the cacti.<br /><br />can anyone here tell me anything about it?&nbsp; are there any tips for maximizing a mescaline experience?&nbsp; does the experience of taking pure mescaline differ much from traditional methods of administration?<br /><br />also, whats the difference between sulfate and citrate?&nbsp; is one better than the other?&nbsp; and lastly, is there a vendor on SR that you recommend?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br />wasp

				i tripped mescaline once, at a music festival.&nbsp; it had been put in chocolates for transportation purposes.&nbsp; it was rather pleasant.&nbsp; it was spot on what h.s.t. says in fear and loathing.&nbsp; it takes a while to come up, and it&#039;s very subtle.&nbsp; but then all a sudden, after giving up hope, it kicks in hard.&nbsp; then it comes on in waves.&nbsp; it&#039;ll be really intense for a while, but then it gives you a break, to gather your thoughts, before smacking you again with more intensity.&nbsp; i would love to do it again sometime.&nbsp;

				Mescaline is pretty special, very warm and benign, quite distinct in nature from the tryptamines, I feel it would be really hard to have a bad time on it. Just hands down great stuff. I would definitely recommend access to nature, preferably on a beautiful day, to get the most out of your mescaline experience. Pure mescaline is more stimulating than ingesting in the form of cacti, most people seem to prefer pure mescaline but some prefer the whole plant experience...makes it much harder to ingest a full dose though. Peyote in particular has many more alkaloids than San Pedro so it will be quite a distinct experience from pure mescaline, while being very much in the same ball park. The different forms mescaline comes in...hcl, sulphate, citrate, acetate etc, will only differ in their molecular weights, so each require slightly different dosages to get to the equivilant place. Hcl is more potent by weight than sulphate for example so less of it is needed. GammaGoblin I can personally vouch for being a reliable mescaline vendor, I have a gram of his mescaline still waiting to be sampled...he should be restocking some time next month.

				&quot;Shipping is processed 2-3 times per week.<br /><br />We always send our products as priority letters. Larger orders will be split into multiple letters. No tracking is available (it&#039;s additional flag for customs). Labels are printed and products are vac-sealed. We ship from EU, but not Netherlands (so it&#039;s less likely that your order will be confiscated by customs). We would prefer that our country of origin is not discussed on the boards nor in comments.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of putting an order in. Someone should look into Domestic U.S though. I&#039;d be all over that for a grand price.
