				Yes right now, like the above said, there is a hand full of them, and they are around fairly often, its just much harder to get xtal here in the states than it is in the EU or other parts of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;You just have to place big enough orders to hold you over until the vendors your looking for have their listings up.

				i am a student of organic chemistry. One of my goals in life is to manufacture LSD, and make it widely available at the lowest possible cost. My motivation is philanthropic, not profit based. I think the world would be better if LSD were the drug of choice among the young, rather than alcohol, marijuana and other drugs.....&nbsp; This is my dream.... To introduce the next generation to the beauty of LSD
