				Me and my buddy always just walk around our neighborhood having amazing conversations and having great mindtrips. On beautiful nights the nature and the sky is just perfect. And we usually smoke on the comedown, it&#039;s just such a chill time. But if I&#039;m doing 3 tabs or more, I have a sitter to keep me in touch with reality and I stay in one room all night. I have conversations with my consciousness and sometimes get to a point where if you asked me my own name, I wouldn&#039;t be able to tell you. Some things my sitter has told me I&#039;ve said while on 300 mics or more:<br /><br />&quot;Am I God?&quot;<br />Him: &quot;What&#039;s your name?&quot; Me: &quot;Oh shit, I can&#039;t remember!&quot;<br /><br />Etc.<br />

I fully recommend sex while tripping.

				Well usually I just take it to chill with friends or go outside and enjoy nature. But I&#039;ve never had that life changing experience that some people have. I want to talk to God, or explore my consciousness, that kind of thing. I&#039;ll probably do it alone, just lay back and let the trip take me somewhere. Is that a good idea? I just want to have this amazing, almost spiritual mind trip basically.

Take a notebook and a pen; write down a 100 questions about anything. It can be about yourself, how to do things, about other people, why things are such a way, what you might wanna know about life, etc etc. The trivial questions should come out in the first 60 and then the last 40 hit real deep. And then I put my pen and paper down when finished and came back to read it on the reflection part of the trip. Wonderful inner-peace experience and it&#039;s one of the reasons I have a strong affinity for philosophy present-day.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21352.msg218705#msg218705">Quote from: philter3 on May 02, 2012, 04:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21352.msg218685#msg218685">Quote from: divinechemicals on May 02, 2012, 04:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Can someone help me out here, what is a good thing to do if I take 500 mics of acid at the same time?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Just BE.

I say you won&#039;t WANT TO stay in the room. And if I may suggest, steer clear of technology. One of the coolest breakthroughs of tripping I&#039;ve experienced is, the profound insight lies past the visuals. The lights and colors mostly a distraction from the hidden enlightenment; it&#039;s odd but I don&#039;t even notice OEV anymore unless I start to get bored.

				Sounds good, I&#039;m not looking for visuals this time around anyways. I really want a spiritual experience, I&#039;m hoping 500 mics can get me there. I don&#039;t know if I believe in God or anything, but I kind of believe that the universe is conscious and I want this trip to put me in a place where I can feel like I understand the universe more and maybe even communicate with it for a little while.

I wish you luck. If you want a completely memorable experience; DMT at the peak, outside.<br /><br />This is what I received from my most enlightening trip: You ARE (part of) the universe and you can tap into it&#039;s power if you wish. It&#039;s your choice whether to make it a constructive or destructive footprint before you rejoin the collective consciousness upon death.

				An LSD orgasm is a definite must-try experience. Whether it&#039;s sex or masturbation (although sex is obviously preferable).<br /><br />Another good one is, to have a shower in the dark... The idea popped into my head one day while tripping my balls off at home with some mates. I made sure I was in the shower and aware of the physical space around me, then called out for a buddy to stick his hand inside the bathroom door and turn the light off for me (to avoid slipping and smashing my head while getting back in the wet shower). Also had some trippy music playing on a small stereo. So much fucking fun! I was laughing hysterically the whole time and could see what looked like a mix of lasers and &quot;auras&quot; kind of beaming around the room. Sounds random but I ended up believing I was a little christmas elf, dancing and singing in the snow (shower).<br /><br />

				Riding Roller Coasters :o or doing anything at an amusement park when tripping is awesome, the general public looks funny as shit when your tripping. Mushrooms are great for this too used to do it all the time when we were teenagers ;D

				As much as I like Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, etc., I find their music too intense and chaotic on LSD. In fact I can&#039;t listen to any modern music on LSD, except on lower dosages. Baroque music sounds best to me when I am tripping. Even if you don&#039;t care for classical music, try listening to Bach while on LSD; you might develop an appreciation for it.

				Find a relatively light pollution free area that is also safe to be tripping at. Pick a night where the sky will be pretty cloudless if not completely cloudless. Bring a few friends ( at least one who is sober), some fold-up chairs or blankets, and watch stars and the universe pass you by. The most humbling and centering experience I ever had was doing this 2 hours into my first ever acid trip. Quite beautiful.

				I love to sit in the park and listen and watch the wind blowing through the grass. It&#039;s really like the earth is breathing. Then I adjust my breathing to try and match it.<br /><br />Lying on your back and watching clouds go by is amazing too.<br /><br />Also watching the trails birds leave behind. I remember one time on mescaline I was watching willy wagtails or swallows or whatever flying around a grassy field. The trails were chasing the birds! It was a bit like that old windows screensaver with all the 3d pipes extending all over the place.<br /><br />+1 for the strawberries but watermelon and mandarins are my favorite.

				This thread is great. Getting lots of inspiration for my next trip. <br /><br />Some of my favorite things to experience on LSD:<br /><br />1) Sex. I swear orgasms make me trip harder.<br />2) Watch or listen to some stand-up comedy. <br />3) Listen to an audiobook. I especially recommend Salman Rushdie, if you&#039;re into his stuff at all.&nbsp; <br />4) Watch something educational. I once watched a Nova special on fractal geometry that blew my mind.<br />5) Watch my rabbit run and jump like a little maniac. Visually interesting + good vibes.<br />6) Look at Google Art Project. It&#039;s like going to a museum without all the fucking people.<br />7) Find a quiet, dark place and meditate.<br />8) Cook a gourmet meal. <br />9) Sex. Because once is never enough. <br />10) Drink a nice quality beer and talk with the wife, friends, my shadow, whoever.

				Yoga is great. Last time I was tripping I did not want to stop doing child&#039;s pose. Quote from me: &quot;Now I understand why Muslims pray 9 times a day!!&quot; lol<br /><br />And for sure, having an orgasm. Having an orgasm while peaking on LSD was the closest I have come to smoking DMT without smoking DMT.

				A lot of the typical things to do have been mentioned so I will add a few odd ones.<br /><br />1.) Follow chickens around laughing your ass off at them. This only works if you keep chickens of course, but being a &quot;good life&quot; follower, I have half a dozen hens. Honestly, I cant stop laughing when I see their little faces and expressions. <br /><br />2.) Take a nice bath while lemon jelly/thievery corporation is playing. Im so surprised so few people do this, its just the best thing to do!<br />You come out the bath, all warm and relaxed and can just lie naked on your bed, chilling.<br /><br />3.) Watch something from your childhood and be transported back there. <br />Just dont watch &quot;the fox and the hound&quot;, an old Disney film. I cried for like twenty minuets, I would have lost some serous man points if I was with someone.&nbsp; :&#039;(

I&#039;m sure I could find a few snakes and crocodiles. Not sure where I&#039;m at these days on the ethical question but the zoo itself is well designed, large and has a real &#039;forresty&#039; feel about it. Not like the US and European zoos that I&#039;ve seen where there is just a fuck load of concrete everywhere and animals in really shitty environments.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21352.msg274961#msg274961">Quote from: slybootz on June 05, 2012, 05:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21352.msg274879#msg274879">Quote from: PaintingGalves on June 05, 2012, 04:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Gotta bump this and ask... has anyone been to the ZOO?

Its fairly large and well thought out - if I start bugging out near the big animals and their poo I&#039;ll just retreat with an ipod to the butterfly or bird enclosure or something. Amusment park sounds like a good idea but only have sub-par ones where I&#039;m at. Took up skydiving recently but theres no fucking way I&#039;m combing drugs with that until I&#039;ve got a few hundred jumps under my belt and even then the sensible first thing would be some MDMA rather than a hallucinogen. <br />

				An old deadhead I met at rothbury in 08 was telling me about how him and his buddies each ate a few tabs of that Jesus acid going around in &#039;94 and went skydiving.&nbsp; Blew my mind when he told me that, but I&#039;m definitely seeing it as more of a possibility for me in the future.

				I love doing trips at music festivals. This time next week, I will be tripping on some of the Dalai Lama blotter, at the best festival I have ever been to! I cannot wait :)<br /><br />Aside from festivals, getting immersed in nature is the business when tripping.<br /><br />And as previously said, you can&#039;t beat having sex!

				Wow, after seeing all these posts about sex on acid I might have to indulge. I&#039;ve always found playing on instruments to be a BLAST. I Highly recommend you musicians/percussionist/handymen out there check out Hank Drums on youtube and build some. Trust me, you take that to a group doing acid and EVERYONE LOVES IT. PM me if you need building tips 8) <br /><br />nature walks, good friends, and alone time/music are my favorite things to do on cid.<br />
