				If the idea could be worked out right I think it would be nice to have a bartering site around. Instead of btc for payment you could trade equal value amounts of drugs. Both parties could leave feedback about each other and their experience. This would probably open up the door to a lot of assholes trying to scam unless someone could think of way to incorporate a deposit type escrow system. To sign up you could have an amount of BTC in your account and it could be used to cover the other party in the event the product was never sent or was bunk. Each party would have tracked shipping and ship the same day. <br /><br />Anyone have any ideas on how this could possibly work?

				Or the bitcoins you set aside to cover the deal, you could just use to buy the drugs.&nbsp; :P Yes that would be a grand idea and we could call it silk..... silk road!

				Yeah it was a pretty fucking stupid idea. I was just thinking of the times I&#039;ve had an oversupply of one substance and wishing I could just trade it for something else. This works out great IRL but not so much when it&#039;s anonymous.
