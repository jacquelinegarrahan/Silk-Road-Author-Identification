				100% of the coins need to go to whoever we are helping. Nothing to administration etc. If that&#039;s the case, I&#039;ll pitch in, in spite of hardly having enough money to buy new underwear.

				modified OP to include SR listing and direct BTC address for donations to the toy drive and thanksgiving project. I will be happy to coordinate with anyone who wants to head an overseas effort (I don&#039;t know where to buy large quantities of toys and turkeys in the UK for example), but I will create separate addresses for each donation. Donate what you can. 100% will go toward toys from the toy drive account, and 100% will go toward food from the turkey account. No BS I want to do something HUGE for the holidays this year courtesy of the Silk Road community!<br /><br />Lets get started on a path toward giving a great Christmas to children who would otherwise not be able to :)

				I like your idea. I would consider helping with any UK effort, but I&#039;d need to know more about it first. Is the idea to make it publicly known that this is a Silk Road project or would it be completely anonymous? Have you worked out all the details of how to keep any participants (the one&#039;s obtaining the toys/turkeys) completely anonymous? PM me on Friday the 12th (or later) if you want any help with the UK effort.<br /><br />+1 for a good idea, I hope it works out. :)

				I don&#039;t have it all worked out quite yet, but I want it to be known that the donations are from Silk Road members. I am working on the details still, because we must also remain anonymous, but that is what we do here every day, right, deliver things anonymously. I know I will need some help with this if it gets the momentum I hope for.&nbsp;

				I hate to be a downer but this would get shut down just specifically for the fact of what it&#039;s &quot;tied&quot; to.&nbsp; Ignorance and fear would make anyone involved a target.<br /><br />That said though this is a very positive idea, I just don&#039;t know that communities would accept it, given what the SR is used for.

				They don&#039;t need to know until after the fact. But I think it should be known what our community is capable of doing for good and selfless reasons.

				Personally, I liked BigBill&#039;s method better. He gave out free grams of his jamacian oil to any canadians that gave to food-shelters during the CA Thanksgiving-week and he said that he&#039;ll do the same once the US Thanksgiving comes around.<br /><br />Not that I&#039;m against Wretched&#039;s idea. It&#039;s just that it is less direct with the charity and the like, that&#039;s all.<br /><br />And as a tinfoil-hat kind of guy, I&#039;d worry about the funds being misappropriated.
