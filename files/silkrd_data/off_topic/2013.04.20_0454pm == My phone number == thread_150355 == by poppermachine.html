				So I&#039;m kind of stuck doing nothing for the next few days and I&#039;m looking for a way to pass the time. Thinking about getting on a train, buying a burner phone wherever I end up and posting the number on here. Would any of you call me?

				Just realize that LE could track a burner phone, so if someone gets on the phone with you and they are LE you can consider yourself an ex member of the forums.<br /><br />Chaos

				And what would they do once I arrive where they are waiting for me? Even if I turn my phone off in between stops? What exactly would they be arresting me for? Conspiracy to talk on the phone about doing drugs? I literally hope I get like 10 phone calls all from people telling me they are the DEA.
