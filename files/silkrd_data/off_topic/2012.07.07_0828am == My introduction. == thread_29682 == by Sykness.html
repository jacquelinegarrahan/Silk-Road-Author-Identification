				Hello, people of Silk Road, My name is Sykness and I am new to the site and all of it&#039;s awesome qualities. From my understanding, Silk Road works as a system of rating, being a good buyer and also being a good vendor, and although I have not had either happen in my time being a member on Silkroad, I want to get in touch with the community because I want to be trusted. For what you may ask, well I see how some people become vendors on the site and earn extra or even make their living from doing so. I am currently a &quot;Street&quot; Vendor which before Silk Road you all had to deal with those people, but I want to become more. I want to become a top ranked Vendor of Silk Road and have the credibility as some of the other top ranked. As of now I am still a non-seller account but not for long. In the next week I will upgrade my account and attempt to also become a successful Vendor. Mostly consisting of Cannabis or &quot;Marijuana&quot; but not entirely. I have some fair prices in mind for when all that starts to happen, but what I want right now is to reach out to the community on the forum get to talk to people and see if I can gain some customers. If you&#039;re reading this and saying to yourself &quot;Wow &quot;cool story bro&quot; I would have to say it&#039;s the truth and I don&#039;t have much else right now other than my word. So please get in touch if you seem interested in me as a choice for a Vendor, I want to get people what they want. That way it satisfies the both Vendor and buyer.
