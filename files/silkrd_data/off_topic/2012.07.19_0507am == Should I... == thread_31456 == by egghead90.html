				It may add a little security but personally i use the same username on SR and on the forums, i use a different password on SR than on the forums because of that.

				Mine is, there shouldn&#039;t be a problem. As long as there isn&#039;t a normal personal connection, I don&#039;t see the problem.

				If both the SR main site and SR forum servers were seized at the same time, LEO could match up information between identically named accounts to provide for a more solid case against a given individual. This is, of course, assuming that said individual was dumb enough to disclose incriminating identification information in their forum posts. Your forum posts should obviously never discuss anything remotely close to your personal life, including family, friends, work, school, or location information.

				i used to post here using the same name I buy with, but eventually decided it wasn&#039;t a good idea for a number of reasons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Actually, I think i&#039;m gonna go back and delete all the posts I made with my old account because I think I may have said too much.&nbsp; nothing incriminating, but I sometimes wonder if there&#039;s enough info about my buying habits, general location, personality, etc to narrow in on me if there was ever a raid on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m probably making a big deal out of nothing, but I&#039;d rather be like a ghost here.<br /><br />Also, you can talk more freely about products and vendors if you&#039;re posting from a name different than the one you buy with.&nbsp; some sketchy vendors might keep addresses on file to blackmail people who talk shit about them.<br /><br />I think in the future I&#039;m gonna ditch my screen name once i start to get up around 500 posts.&nbsp; I like it here and want to keep posting, but I don&#039;t want to be the next celebrity username in a Gawker article.<br /><br />hey, on a semi-related note, is it a security breach to upload an avatar from my computer?&nbsp; I really want a picture of Guy Smiley from sesame street

Basically removing any extra property values on the picture that could link it to your computer.
