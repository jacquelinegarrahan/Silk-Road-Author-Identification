				I&#039;m looking for a trip report for speed. But not adderal. No. Just your regular racemic amphetamine sulphate (aka. street speed).<br /><br />Not meth either.<br /><br />All I can find are reports on adderal and such.<br /><br />But I understand street speed can be a little different than adderal since it has an equal number of left and right isomers unlike adderal which has 76% d-amp and 44% l-amp, making adderal a much smoother drug with less agitation.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do not have Adderal, but I can get speed.<br /><br />So will anyone do me this favour and write a nice little trip report for street speed? Or at least point out the major differences in feeling between it and adderal?<br /><br />Thanks!

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">TAKEN FROM EROWID<br /><br />Three of these friends and myself proceeded to do a line each of about 30mg in cover of the bathroom, and we used a crummy dance-cd cover to snort from. I really got that junkies-hidin-from-tha-law-type sensation, and it was kinda quirky and charming, aside from the bitchin itch in the nasal cavity. We then joined the party with perhaps a slightly exaggerated attempt at being inconspicuous. <br /><br />I wasn&#039;t quite sure what to expect, seeing as my experience with drugs is somewhat limited; I&#039;ve smoked hash about a dozen times and taken mushrooms twice, the latter being the defining experience for me, but alas I fear I have little to add to the many glorious descriptions of this masterpiece of nature. Suffice to say I enjoyed it tremendously, and it fulfilled all my criteria for the proverbial &#039;heaven on earth&#039;. Consequently, I kept comparing the two as the amphetamine kicked in. Therein lay my major error, for I soon discovered the opposite nature of these substances; in contrast with the &#039;shrooms incurring an intense one-on-one with your abstract and subconscious self, I now, after half an hour, felt as if every person and object withheld some special meaning, and that my altruistic discerning of as much of this meaning as possible was my singular purpose. <br /><br />But, intriguing as this was, I was still waiting for some major effect to kick in. It wasn&#039;t until after a couple more hours and the rest of my beer was gone that I realized that the amphetamine&#039;s constant plateau of heightened awareness, as opposed to uncontrollable emotion and generally annoying everybody, was the desired effect instead of a stepping stone. I had been waiting for a shift in my perception, but I had not only kept my normal perception, and cancelled out the drowsing effects of the alcohol, but infact gained an entirely new dimension to my sensory skills which, it finally dawned on me, lay entirely at my disposal to play with. <br /><br />The main difference from standard reality lay in the fluidity of which time moved. It was as though I was in an untouchable zone that moved me around, both physically and spiritually, with the precision and grace of a talented ballerina, as opposed to the lumbering and clumsy movement of regular time. No evil could touch me in this zone; while not completely euphoric, it was a sense of complete acceptance of any events that might occur. <br /><br />And the dialogues, oh man! I felt like Oscar Wilde as I postulated and jested my way through the crowd, coming up with instant sarcastic and otherwise witty remarks that I never would have even touched upon normally. Again comparing it to mushrooms, I understood that while the rantings one so definitvely believe to be the only true knowledge on a &#039;shroom trip generally aren&#039;t worth recalling(I taped one of the trips, and it was really lame), this was really quality stuff from a much more than sober mind. In regards to the mixing with alcohol, I am uncertain what effect this has on the amphetamine-high, seeing as this was my debut. However, I sort of got the impression that the alcohol neatly embellished the effect of the drug, without compromizing it. <br /><br />The zone continued for about five hours, and was rapidly wearing off at the sixth. So at 04am, I repeated the bathroom operation with my friends, and as the party wore off I joined one of them in retreating to his house, where I had a riveting conversation with his father, a prominent politician. I could explore every angle of a subject, and decide how to lead it in order to incur the optimal psychological effect. I don&#039;t mean to say that I was brilliant or anything, just that the process of choosing words was extremely satisfying, and no matter how trivial a topic was, I found everything genuinely fascinating. I stayed until morning, when I found it best to head for home. The remnants of the Pepper wore out in a nice straight curve. I haven&#039;t slept yet, as of 11am. <br /><br />In retrospect I think that, pleasant experience as it was, I&#039;d do good in restricting the eventual further use of amphetamine to as rarely as possible, preferably never. Although I have felt no urges as of yet, I am aware of the alure of escalating the use gradually without noticing it until you have crossed the line. It&#039;s more of a elixir of mental focus than a drug, really. And it cannot be stressed too much that this is not an encouragement to use it; I make these kinds of choices on a basis of learning what I can about any drug I plan on using, and my own relation to it, and then decide if the ride is worth the risk.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Addy for me is a &quot;Lets focus, get shit done, and learn as much as possible&quot; type of drug. I just want to go through my list of shit-to-do and check everything off. I actually feel pretty good on it too.<br /><br />Whereas speed is more of a &#039;higher state of functioning&#039;, you can process things faster, you have more energy and are more alert, you can communicate faster etc...

Horny as hell too.<br />Then for the next few hours (6 - 20 depending on dosage) the stimulation wears off and the next day your muscles feel a bit sore and may have a bit of a lack of energy.
