				I&#039;ve noticed recently that the more publicity a drug get&#039;s the sooner it becomes outlawed, for instance Salvia, now a controlled substance throughout the U.S. and it&#039;s Schedule 1 if&nbsp; I remember correctly. The Salvia boom hit a while back and soon a bunch of stupid teenagers where taking bong hits of the stuff and driving down major highways in the name of good Youtube videos. Within almost no time from the video going viral to it being aired on every god damn news channel in America it had hit Congress and was declared illegal. Now take a look at JWH-018, which is also a controlled substance (officially the scheduling is temporary but let&#039;s face the facts, how many drugs have been emergency scheduled and then been unscheduled, none, that&#039;s how many) JWH-018 was available on the market as herbal incenses for quite a few years, at one point I&#039;d estimate about a quarter of my towns population was using it. The reason it took so long to hit Congress for scheduling was that it never caught as much hype, Miley Cyrus wasn&#039;t smoking it, no one made a bunch of Youtube videos of them smoking it and driving down the road, and it never really made major news as a result. Now think about this, what if no one posted Youtube videos or blogged about the next and latest legal high? If we could somehow gain a consensus from just about every drug user that they wouldn&#039;t spam it all over the internet, it may never actually become illegal. If we can behave like normal people and not do anything stupid with the next legal high, that means no O.D.s, no Youtube or other social media publicity then we may just get to keep, well maybe not keep it but it will definitely fly under the radar long enough for everyone to have had there fun with it. So I say we all get together and tell every one of those idiots who thinks it&#039;s okay to take 3mg of NBOme&#039;s (I&#039;m sure you at least know one) sit them down and say &quot;GOD DAMMIT, YOU ARE RUINING YET ANOTHER GREAT THING! If you would quite blabbing all over the place about it maybe it won&#039;t be illegal by next month, but if you keep trying to O.D. and posting trip reports on youtube it will certainly be illegal in a flash. So what do ya say guys? Can we all agree on this?

				I just googled an article and it mentions one person dying of heart failure on this. The dose was fucking insanely high though so I&#039;d chalk this drug up as much safer than alcohol but of course the media will never see it that way.
