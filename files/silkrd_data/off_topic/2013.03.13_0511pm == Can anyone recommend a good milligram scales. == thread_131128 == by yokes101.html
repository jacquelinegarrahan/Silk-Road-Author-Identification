				these scales are made for weighing jewellery. Not really made for chemicals. works fine but only if you can get away with + - 5 mg. <br />Fine for DMT, MDMA, 2c-B.... but substances that are active under 5mg should be weighed with a more professional scale. <br /><br />I had something like this. bought it in a head shop. I don&#039;t know the brand and i don&#039;t have the scale anymore. Look around in the local shops. You need to test these before buying.

				for under 5 mg dosing i think what you really need is to dose it in liquid form. and get a syringe.<br />&nbsp;you could use a scale like the linked one.&nbsp; weigh out higher doses. put it in a liquid solvent and dose with drops or evaporate the solvent after measuring out the doses. <br /><br />&nbsp;all you need is simple math. problem solved. and its cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;i don&#039;t know much about scales but i did a search and a profesional scale used for Pharma for weighing 1 mg&nbsp; could cost 500 and up! that is a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;research liquid dosing and making blotters you&#039;ll get around the problem.<br />hopefully some ppl with more experience will chip in and share info. <br /><br />

				I got my mg scale from the vendor etizolam a long while ago. I placed my order and finalized it after 16 days and it still wasn&#039;t there but I didn&#039;t want an auto FE on my account....Had to wait a whole freakin month and a half or maybe even 2 months I don&#039;t remember for it to come...but it was a good price and definitely worth it cause I wasn&#039;t in a rush.<br /><br />Here&#039;s his profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a320190a0f<br />Here&#039;s the link to the scale: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/24ff255c03<br /><br />you&#039;re welcome.
