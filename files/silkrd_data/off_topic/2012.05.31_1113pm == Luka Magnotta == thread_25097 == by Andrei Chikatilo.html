				let me preface my reply by saying the video you want to see cant be unseen...that said bestgore is the host of the video the nyc had it but the canadian site bestgore is the host and also a huge part in helping to capture luca..if you must watch it nothing any1 can say will stop you&nbsp; but really consider what you want...it is real he does perform necrophilia and he does abuse that poor mans corpse...i cant say dont watch when i have but im telling you its far worse than anything you will see in mainstream web..i think its far more evil than 3 guys 1 hammer..that guy being off the streets is a great thing only issue i have is being extradited to canada...i know he committed the crime there but canada will not punish him like germany would bestgore has the full story and video...if you go just be ready

				the story in very interesting if you can stomach the grue...he actually set up a dozen or more dumdum youtube accounts to promote and hype the vidoe a week or more before he released it and flamed ppl who went to the vids to get the link and eluded that he killed his aunt and a homeless man and had video somewhere in the deep web..but yea he planned the murder and was hyping it on youtube before it even happened...bestgore is the site to check but if there vid wont work gorgrish&#039;s will...the bestgore community outed him on youtube on several of the accounts it wouldnt surprise me at all if he went into the internet cafe to check the pages...hes an attention whore...the kitten killing videos didnt get him enough exposure i dont guess .he was also directly linked to 2 other canadian serial killers i dont remember there names but bestgore has everything about it

				I wonder the thought process these people go through in their day to day life. <br /><br />I might think of smoking a joint and taking the dog down the park to fill in the day. I wonder how someone wakes up one day and decides to fill it with fucking corpses and eating them.

I heard he also taped himself performing cunnilingus on his aunt&#039;s corpse after forcing her to OD. Apparently a relative of his came forward on BestGore to out him, around the same time other members of that site were recognizing him from videos he posted of himself killing kittens. She claimed he also tried to murder his whole family by burning the house down as a child. Makes me wonder what his supposed relative was doing on a gore site to begin with though. I suspect such predilection for violence or a taste for it must run in his family.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25097.msg290200#msg290200">Quote from: anonaus on June 14, 2012, 01:17 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">yeah he was arrested looking at articles of himself on the interwebz. he was also in a relationship with karla homolka....look up her crimes were just as bad and similar in nature in they were also videotaped<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This was fabricated by Luka in an attempt to build acclaim around himself prior to him filming the murder of Lin Jun. He edited Wikipedia articles replacing Karla Homolka&#039;s husband&#039;s name with his own. Also, Karla and Paul&#039;s crimes were taped for personal enjoyment. They never attempted to broadcast their tapes.

You saw him alive and moving at the beginning of the vid. I&#039;m sure the motel the killing took place in has CCTV -- they would have seen him enter alive, and not come out.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying the vid wasn&#039;t sick shit. I&#039;ve seen a lot of that.
