				A total middle aged loser family guy ripped off a friend of a mine for a LOT of money.&nbsp; He lives in orange county, california.&nbsp; Total thief.<br /><br />My friend would like a couple guys to go to his house, knock on door and put a &quot;scare&quot; in him to pay up.&nbsp; Obviously nothing serious.&nbsp; Perhaps threaten him and his family if he dares to go cops about this (obviously fake as well).<br /><br />Anyone?&nbsp; Thx.

It sounds totally hilarious. Especially the part where the guy&#039;s a crazy loon with a gun on him, flips the fuck out over scary people threatening him at his house, and shoots somebody in the head!<br /><br />What a terrific prank.&nbsp; Man, I can&#039;t wait to see the look on the guy&#039;s face when he finds out it was just a joke.&nbsp; And hey -- I might get to, since he could have a $100 surveillance camera pointed at his front porch!&nbsp; Even if no one gets hurt, seeing your buddies perform will be comic gold.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the cops will think so too; they&#039;ll be making popcorn at the station and watching it over and over.&nbsp; <br /><br />The YouTube video will be a hit, and then you and your friend will get to come up on stage and talk all about how you did it on America&#039;s Funniest Dumbass Felonies.&nbsp; After you get paroled.<br /><br />--So yeah, definitely, go for it.&nbsp; And then come back and tell us how much fun it was to threaten some guy&#039;s life and family.&nbsp; Nothing could possibly go wrong!
