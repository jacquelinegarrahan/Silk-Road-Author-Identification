				I was figuring some random stores would be unaware or careless of the law involving products containing Pseudoephedrine had to be placed behind the shelf. Pretty much, I wanted to try Methamphetamine, I would buy it on Silk Road, but I don&#039;t have any money right now. Someone is willing to trade a gram for a box of Sudafed, so I figured I&#039;d try to find a box of this on the shelf, no luck, only finding the Phenylephrine. I don&#039;t have an ID or license so I&#039;m unable to just get it behind the counter, also not really wanting to get it off the internet. Honestly, I was planning on just stealing some, which is why I was wondering if anyone has been to a store selling it on the shelf? I&#039;ve checked pharmacies, like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, they only have the cards to take to the counter. If anyone has any suggestions that might be useful, it&#039;s appreciated. Thanks.

				Depends on what country you live in, but its unlikely.&nbsp; Its pretty common for cooks to use smurfs to source their PSE, because 20 random people each getting a single script for pseudo is not nearly as suss as one person getting 20 scripts, the idea is that the smurf buys the &#039;behind the counter&#039; stuff.&nbsp; Given that they aren&#039;t exactly gunna be regularly cleaning out the chemist, it is much less likely to raise alarms.&nbsp; I doubt the guy offering you this deal expected you to run around trying to find a pharmacy that has pseudo lying around in the aisle.

				Yeah, good luck trying to find one. I&#039;m 99% sure that you can&#039;t get pseudo on shelf (in mainland US anyways). They take that law very seriously and seem to be making it stricter each year. An example being something like a person is only limited to 2 boxes per month or something like that. They have that shit stored in a computer and everything. I guess your best bet would to try and have someone of age buy it for you. Preferably a close friend since your not going to want anyone to know you&#039;re doing ice. If more people went back to some old school P2P style instead of Pseudo recipes....<br />Either way, if you find some, just make sure it&#039;s not shake-N-bake. That method is disgraceful.<br />Good luck and happy hunting

				Dude you are going to be spending a lot more money making a gram then buying it. On top of that ephedrine is not the only difficult to obtain chemical. You have multiple chemicals, reagents, and solvents to buy plus equipment (no matter how crude). Any one of those chemicals or pieces of equipment cost more then just buying some. Not too mention the fact that you get a couple chemicals and soda bottles in one place and all of a sudden you are a manufacturer getting 20 years for trying to make $10 worth of speed.

				No.&nbsp; RP/I2 is the most common method of producing d-meth. Most of the meth for sale on SR at the moment is almost certainly synthesized using this method.

				No, the lightbulbs was just my own idea after mucking around with glassblowing for the last few days.&nbsp; The method I&#039;ve seen used most for nano scale(batches less than an ounce or so) mostly use any borosilicate(pyrex etc) flask that can be stoppered.&nbsp; Here is a youtube video of a guy running a &quot;simulation&quot; of the reaction(It looks pretty much identical to when I&#039;ve run it)<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBm2R1Ef6K4
