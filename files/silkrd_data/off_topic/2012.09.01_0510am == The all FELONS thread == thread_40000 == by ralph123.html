				anybody else committed a felony? or maybe 2? Yea it&#039;d be nice to have my gun rights back but as it stands I&#039;m allowed a muzzle loader or a fucking bow and arrow. So much for home defense I guess I have to listen for things that go bump in the night and then creep upon them and break their fucking necks.

				Man I cant even vote but I can get those rights back but until then I can influence a bunch of people.

				A felony is like a get out of jury duty free card for 7 years. And in some unfortunate cases may result in ass rape.... But hey... No fucking jury duty!! One could argue it&#039;s almost worth it....&nbsp; ;D

				You can still get a gun. Just because the State says you don&#039;t have the right doesn&#039;t mean you have to play by their rules. You are as free as you choose to be.
