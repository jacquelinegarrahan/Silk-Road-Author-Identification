				Just know that you shouldn&#039;t expect much back if you help this guy. I hooked him up with a great deal on a forward order months ago and never saw more than a few bitcoins for it. Always the same story, &quot;just a couple more days and I&#039;ll have more coins&quot;, got sick of the same routine and just wrote it off as a life lesson. This guy uses heroin too, (NOT that I hold that against anyone!) but if you&#039;re tempted to send him BTC for help I&#039;d definitely keep that in mind...

				Maybe he&#039;s for real? Maybe the only reason he cooked meth is because he had Vincent Vega in his house with a gun to his kids? MAYBE he is out on his arse, with his family in the cold?<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t believe it for a second, I think he&#039;s a junkie phishing for change!

				Somebody called the cops on my friend. They raided his house on an anonymous tip (he recently broke up with his crazy girlfriend) <br /><br />Him n his roommate sold reg weed on a small scale, but he had a big drug collection, hash, LSD, 2c-b, im sure he had a few pharms, probably some DMT... <br />He&#039;s been in trouble with the police before too..<br /><br />Anyways point of the story is the cops told his landlord that he was making meth. <br /><br />Shits ridiculous

				Yeah IF it is true I feel bad for you to have lost your home but at the same time I&#039;m not certain how Googling anywhere would prove your story is true. You could have just picked something out of a local paper or something like that. Also IF you were cooking Meth where your family were that really isn&#039;t the way mate. Business and family should be kept separate. And cooking Ice is dangerous as it is, why would you want to raise a child in that environment? <br /><br />

				If you would have said &quot;hey, I like heroin a lot and could use some BTCs so I don&#039;t vomit and shit on everything for a few weeks&quot; you may have had a shot here.&nbsp; Bullshit sob stories don&#039;t work when only a few people here seem to have empathy for drug users and dealers.&nbsp; Every single one of us here is either a user, dealer, or trying way too hard to fit in on a drug marketplace forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just do what the other desperate addicts do and set up a vendor account and hold a finalize-early sale.&nbsp; If the prices are low enough you know there will be idiots to take non-existent goods off of your hands, sadly.&nbsp; Overall, I give you a 4/10 on your attempt at getting charity BTCs.&nbsp; It would have been a 3/10, but it was so pathetic I felt ashamed for you and added a pity point.

				sounds like someone ran out of go fast lol <br /><br />i live in a bad town where we actually have a little patch of woods called &quot;hobo&#039;s jungle&quot;<br />one day i was at walmart and this guy came up to me with a gas can and told me some story about his family and this and that, y&#039;know some tweeker scam story. <br />i gave him 3 dollars to get the hell away from me, and went about my business. <br />2 weeks later, the same guy with the same gas can gives me the same story...<br />i told him he gave me the same story 2 weeks ago and i gave him 3 dollars<br />he told me he was still stranded and was still trying to raise money to get back to his family<br />so, being the southern gentleman that i am, i told him i&#039;d buy him anything in the store or buy him a 5 gallon gas can and fill it up, or take him all the way back to his supposed family wherever they may be. <br />he said thats real nice of you man you&#039;re a real nice guy blah blah i just need some cash to give to my wife so she can buy diapers and formula for the kid she knows what to get i just need some money so she can get it. <br />i was like whatever, i&#039;ll give him 2 dollars, not that big of a deal. <br />well some days or weeks later, i see this guy at walmart again...same gas can and everything, still pulling the same scam. <br />so this time i go up to him and i say whats the matter bud, you outta go fast. and he gives me the same fucking story...<br />i was like dude...do you not remember me, i&#039;ve given you money twice...not once but twice...and you gave me the same story both times. he walked off and i saw him like 3 more times that i went to walmart and he was always holding a gas can and begging for gas money but not gas...<br /><br />i think if you&#039;re gonna try to scam people you should come up with a solid story and solid back up stories and shit like that before you start trying to scam people.

ITS BAD<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s not all bad<br />Thank God I have forwarded this notice to you so that you can get your life together<br /><br />Dear Beloved ,<br /><br />As you read this, I don’t want you to feel sorry for me I am mrs Corazon Abaya sister to the ex-president of Philippines and merchant in Dubai .I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer and It has defiled all forms of medical treatment right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.<br />I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business.<br /><br />Though I am quite successful in life and mostly my business I was never generous,I focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.<br /><br />Now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.<br /><br />Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well&nbsp; I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul hence I have decided to give alms to charity organizations I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E and some countries in Africa and i discovered the funds ended up in the hands of directors of these organization with little or nothing for those how this generous donations are meant for.<br /><br />Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept money to themselves.<br /><br />Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit I have with a Security Company abroad.<br />I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10% for you, your time and also any expenses incurred during this Great task.<br /><br />Thanks and God Be With You as you respond<br />Hopefully,<br /><br />Email: abaya111@yahoo.com.hk<br /><br />Mrs Abaya Corazon <br /><br />Don&#039;t concern yourself that she spelled the Philippines wrong<br />and I had to correct it...I&#039;m sure she&#039;s legit
