				So i got a bunch of friends together with the intention of getting fake id&#039;s for cheaper (group rates would be cheaper) they all gave me the money and now it seems that the vendor i was going to buy from (crcr1) is a sketchball whom I should not give any of my money. He pulled all his listings and now people are starting to complain that he isn&#039;t delivering the id&#039;s. Now I&#039;m stuck with not enough money to buy id&#039;s from a legit vendor and I really really don&#039;t want to disappoint my friends and have to give them there money back. Any ideas on what to do?

				If they are your friends they&#039;ll understand. Show them SR and possibilities and figure it out all together.

				Does the &quot;legit&quot; vendor not offer group discounts? I&#039;d contact them and ask first. <br /><br />But if its still too much money, I&#039;d let the friends know that the previous price you quoted is no longer available and it now costs however much. If they don&#039;t like it, refund their money. If they&#039;re ok with it and give you more money, get the IDs
