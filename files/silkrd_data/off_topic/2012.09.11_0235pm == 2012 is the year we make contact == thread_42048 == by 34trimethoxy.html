				There will be other life forms found. Dont know if it will be this year, but I can almost guarantee the life form will be very basic like bacteria. Then everyone will just get really disappointed that they were probed by bacteria.

				Contact is not the issue.<br /><br />There are BILLIONS of stars in each of the TRILLIONS of galaxies.<br /><br />The universe will be teeming with life. If it exists here in such abundance, it exists elsewhere in abundance. You have to be really thick not to be able to comprehend this.<br /><br />The problem is actually DISCLOSURE by the govenments and shadowy agencies of the world.<br /><br />Should full disclosure be made, all religions INSTANTLY become worthless trash. Religions are still a HUGE way of controlling the masses. Always have been, always will be. The elite will never give that particular tool up.<br /><br />Life exists. Intellegent life too.<br /><br />Ever wondered where the tech has come from over the last 30 years??<br /><br />Cicero respects all lifeform, alien or otherwise. <br /><br />Intellegent alien life would probably see us as a parasite on the planet, unable to respect any of the creatures&nbsp; we share our planet with. Intelligent alien life would probbaly just prefer to wipe us out tbh.

				I hope something will happen in my lifetime but i seriously doubt it will unfortunately.<br />I know its not quite the same but the majority of western civillisations in modern history believe that they are living through the &quot;end times/end of days&quot; and I think in the modern world this religious fear has simply been replaced by aliens. <br />Stexo&#039;s right, the probability of it happening specifically in our lifetime is small.<br />That doesn&#039;t take away the fact that it is incredibly improbable that there isn&#039;t or hasn&#039;t been any other form of life in the universe.

The only solution I can see is colonisation of mars/some sort of huge space station.

It&#039;s infinite which makes it very likely that if life can exist in one place that it will exist in another.<br />In my opinion it is the idea of contact in our lifetime which is unlikely. It&#039;s almost impossible that there is no other life in the vastness of the universe/muliverses (depending on your belief about that particular gem)

				I would say that it depends on the definition of contact.&nbsp; If contact is a two way dialog where messages are sent and returned, it will not happen. If contact means discovring the presence of life in any form living or dead, it is a real possibility.

				&lt;tinfoil hat&gt;<br />If seemingly extraterrestrial beings present themselves this year, it won&#039;t actually be beings, just Project Bluebeam coming to fruition. <br />Assuming Bluebeam is real, the &quot;Mayan&quot; (not actually Mayan, as by their calendar it&#039;s 2013 now and doomsday has passed) date (12/21/12) would be perfect, and there&#039;s certainly been more than enough predictive programming that it would be unsurprising. <br />&lt;/tinfoil hat&gt;<br />As far as actual contact, meh.

				Don&#039;t forget alien contact seems to have been done multiple times throughout human history (just not given any attention by the mainstream history), not to mention all these monuments that don&#039;t seem to have been built by humans or have any human specific purpose like the pyramids.

				This is what I believe.<br /><br />1. Humans are genetically engineered descendants of the Annunaki. The Annunaki are 12 ft. tall blonde haired blue eyed humanoids that settled this solar system millions of years ago. Europeans are the closest genetically related to them. They founded Atlantis.<br />2. The Annunaki had a civil war that burned down this solar system. Ruins off the coast of Japan, India, Bimimi, and the pyramids are evidence of this, as well as other historical anomalies. Zues/Odin/Thor/God led the winning side of the pantheon against Satan&#039;s side. Satan was a genetic engineer who tried to take over. Jews descend from and worship satan. Satan is currently trapped on this world and is going to try to role out a NWO after the planned nuclear war in the middle east between Israel and Iran. He directs the masons and the jewish elite, as well as European nobility. He taught the jews fractional reserve banking and is in regular contact with the rockefellers and rothschilds.<br />3. The Nazis in WWII knew this and summoned the annunaki back with &quot;Die Glocke&quot;, or, the &quot;Bell&quot;. The Annunaki will come back to save us in late 2012 after war starts. Satan may make his appearance and try to lead humanity against the returning Annunaki, saying that they are aliens.<br />4. The jews are trying to change the DNA of whites by blending us with non-whites so that God cannot claim his patent on us when he returns.<br /><br />Apparently 9/11 was a planned false flag, but that they didn&#039;t expect the towers to collaspe. Either Nazi elements or Mossad elements did it to exaggerate the effect. For some reason the elites need to control the middle east before the Annunaki return, and since 2001 they have been going crazy trying to do this.

				That white rabbit website is one fucked up site, I still try to figure out what it&#039;s about! <br /><br />My thoughts on how humans came about are that we are probably the result of an alien experiment (or an experiment in progress) and the big tell tell sign for me is the fact that while we possess an incredible machine called the brain which has functionalities that even in 2012 we still only start to use them (like your pineal gland) we regularly use it far less.<br />Possible explanations for this (which i think are both true) are:<br />1) Brain is hijacked through young age by parents - TV - school - society - poisons in foods and medicines etc<br />2) Our brains are a copy of our &quot;owners&quot; (or what traditional religions call God) we are in the image of our creators which happen to be aliens. They just picked a life form on Earth e.g. monkeys and implanted them with their functionality. <br /><br />As such, the people in charge who are working for our alien owners (what David Icke calls Reptilians) are in effect treating as us cattle who always need to be under control for the purposes of their experiments. Us having control of our destiny is of no relation to them.<br /><br />Also a movie that for me is right on the money about the situation on Earth is &quot;Dark City&quot;. If you combine it with concepts from Total Recall (the original movie) and the Matrix I think they bring you closer to understanding the human condition.

At minimum, sustainable one way contact.<br /><br />You also need to keep in mind, that voyager that is some billions of miles away from earth right now, silently sailing through the cosmos has some of our worlds important information engraved on it. Should any life perceive it (depends on your definition of perception), then I would consider this contact - in the form of one way.<br /><br />If you are talking about the countless radio waves that are sent through the Universe from Earth everyday - Old TV broadcasts from the 60&#039;s are still traveling through space - then yes I agree, I believe some other form of life has detected them. It takes a long time for signals to be sent back, unless they can be transmitted by using some type of energy technology that bends time (this is VERY plausible).<br /><br />Some say that the Universe is it&#039;s self perhaps the greats form of life there is. In this ambiguous description contact has already been made.<br /><br />But I really have a feeling that 2012 will be the year, the great one, where IRREFUTABLE evidence of contact is made.<br /><br />Tesla did it a century ago - he also proposed that he knew how to split the world in half. To gain that kind of knowledge, you need information gained from contact.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t it funny that the US and German governments scrambled to seize all of his journals and findings immediately following his death? There is an interesting story I will post when I have more time.<br /><br />This is the year. Wake up those of you who think otherwise. We are on the cusp of something beyond imagination.<br /><br />Ron Paul / Contact 2012

NOTHING physical has changed from the &quot;good&quot; times before 2008, except from the fact that in our heads we believe we are in crisis. All the resources are there, all the factories are there, and everything is just fine. We have just been coerced into believing that we need to save the banks cause they are &quot;too big to fail&quot; when that is just a scheme to funnel money out of the economy and into the pockets of a few individuals controlling those banks. When we wake up to the illusion and stop believing it (like Icelanders did) the rest will fall into place. The best way to kill a snake is by cutting it&#039;s head of, and our current monetary system which is controlled by the Rockefellers and is based on the crazy notion of debt etc is the head of the snake.

				It seems 99% of the crazy people claiming to have had contact with aliens are American.<br /><br />I guess that makes though, America is the center of the universe afterall, aliens will likely go there first

				I love your avatar watestruck ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Btw seems David Icke event today 27th is actually even more important in awakening now. They are going to stream it live so it will be like a mass consciousness exercise. To anyone who understands mass consciousness, this has a very big potential. <br />

				I believe that contact has been made at least 6000 years ago.&nbsp; ET&#039;s provided the information that we required to continue life on earth.<br /><br />Pyramid&#039;s could not have been built with the accuracy they were built with at that time.&nbsp; Modern technology would have a hard time pulling that off with the same accuracy.<br /><br />Sphinx was around water as it has been worn by water.&nbsp; Any idea the last time water was in that desert??&nbsp; Research it.<br /><br />Life everywhere, only question is:<br /><br />Is it carbon based?<br /><br />

				Hey, a normal discussion goin on. . . <br /><br />I think contact will be made without any physical proof.&nbsp; It will be an abstract technique that allows intergalactic travel without the body and through the mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You cannot travel through space with a physical form. It will rot and decay on the trip and of not it will be contaminated with radiation if it survives the long voyage withot gravity. <br /><br />Leave the body behind and travel without it will be the answer.&nbsp; I think everyone whose tried DMT and salvia know ehat I&#039;m talking about. <br />

				Contact is secret; is the moment when everything happens!<br /><br />Contact is the answer; is the reason that everything happens!<br /><br />Contact! Let&#039;s make contact!<br /><br />3-2-1 Contact!<br />

				CLEARNET http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLj06244Yjc UFOs: The Secret Evidence<br /><br />Not nearly as lame as it sounds. For anyone genuinely interested in the phenomenon of UFO observation I recommend this documentary. It makes a powerful argument that the observation of UFOs is largely a function of the testing of US top secret military aircraft, touching on Project Aurora (Hello, X-Files fans) and the CIA&#039;s role in perpetuating the belief that these aircraft were not their own, and belonged to visitors from outta space.<br /><br />It seems an unlikely coincidence to me that aliens would repeatedly fly near large secret military bases with tremendous runways for decades on end without doing anything at all. It&#039;s humans. It&#039;s always humans.<br /><br />It&#039;s by Nick Cook and was on Channel 4 (UK) a few years ago.
