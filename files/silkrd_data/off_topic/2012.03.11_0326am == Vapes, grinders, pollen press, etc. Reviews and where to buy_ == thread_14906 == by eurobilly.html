				Now that I am enjoying a consistent supply of quality meds from the fine vendors on SR, it is time to upgrade my sadly abused equipment. I need a new quality grinder, preferably with a built-in screen and pollen catching compartment, perhaps a nice pollen press that makes those tidy little pucks of pressed goodness, a new piece or two of glass work and maybe a well designed vaporizer. I&#039;ve got some sweet honey oil that can be a bit awkward to work with, so looking for a device that can make administration of this product more efficient.<br /><br />I would like to hear some feedback from the community. What are your recommendations? What are the &quot;must-haves&quot; and the &quot;stay away froms&quot;? I was hoping to find a decent selection here on SR, but this category is pretty bare.<br /><br />There are no smoke shops in my area. Do you feel comfortable buying these items on the clear web or do you know of any hidden sites on Tor that are a better choice? I am willing to pay for quality gear. Not looking for cheaply made plastic junk. Thanks for your feedback...<br /><br />Peace and chicken grease,<br /><br />eb 8)&nbsp;

				grasscity is always good for glass, grinders, etc.<br /><br />you can get a cheap pollen press on ebay for 5 bucks, like i did.&nbsp; works fine.&nbsp; but if you spend a little more you can get a little better torque for a firmer press.<br /><br />if you&#039;ve got a lot of money to spend, you can buy an ill bong specifically for oils...these guys have a bunch: http://www.aqualabtechnologies.com&nbsp; &nbsp;This involves heating a titanium &quot;nail&quot; or &quot;swing&quot; with a blow torch and then dabbing your oil on the red hot metal.&nbsp; for me, this is a little too much dangerous stuff to be dealing with while stoned or otherwise intoxicated, so i just use a cheap oil burner (meth pipe) for smoking oil.&nbsp; <br /><br />make sure you buy glass online from a superstar headshop because too many sites will poorly pack the product so that it shows up broken.

				I use everyonedoesit too. I bought a titanium space case grinder from there. It was expensive but it will grind even the wettest bud. Well worth the money in my opinion
