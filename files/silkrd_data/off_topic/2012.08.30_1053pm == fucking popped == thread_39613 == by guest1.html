				Say you have learnt from your mistakes.<br />Volunteer at lots of charities.<br />Become religious ( or just look the part )<br />Change your life around and get a steady job.<br />Obtain a wife and get her pregnant, or if you have kids that works too.. that depend on you and have no other family that they speak to.<br /><br />Judges look at a lot of this stuff in your favour, what you mustn&#039;t do is get caught again during this time they have let you out not even for a minor offence. <br />I doubt you would go prison or you&#039;d already be there till your trial.

				Start going to church and do community work through your church. Like soup kitchen in the bottom of a church or w/e having a priest vouch for you is really good.

				Dude, firstly I am sooo sorry for you. <br /><br />Secondly,&nbsp; &nbsp;RUN!&nbsp; &nbsp;No Just kidding, Actually like the man said, you wouldn&#039;t be walking around if you were that bad off. You are gonna get it beat or significantly reduced. <br /><br />Lastly, please share how it happened to reassure us we are safe.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Stay strong.

				Unfortunately the best way to get let off easily is indeed to pretend that you are ultra religious, and I am sure a priest vouching for you would be extremely helpful. Of course this assumes you live in the land of the free with a promise of separation of church and state, where it is illegal to have drugs but believing in the God of your area will get you a reduced sentence.
