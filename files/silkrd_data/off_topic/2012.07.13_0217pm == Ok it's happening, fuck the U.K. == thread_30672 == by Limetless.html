				Lol I wont exactly say where I&#039;m going but you&#039;ll find out when I get there and I change my dispatch-from bit on my profile lol. :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about it for a while tbh and after a lot of soul searching and DJ Fresh - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnk4Hk-DKsg&amp;feature=related it has become clear that it&#039;s what I should do. I can&#039;t deal with the rain, cunts, rain, slags, rain and grey faced bastards that constitutes the U.K now and it&#039;s time to get a fucking tan. <br /><br />The wheels are in motion, shits going to happen. :)

				I lived in London for awhile and totally lucked out when I first got over there, locals were talking about how they hadn&#039;t had such a good stretch of weather like we were having in a long time. Towards the end of my stay it started to get rainy and cold.<br /><br />Anyways DJ Fresh is awesome and I have to say I would prefer UK to the US at this point. I had a total blast when I was over there. I have always loved EDM, especially DnB so I was in heaven. I am pretty worldly and have good manners so I didn&#039;t have the whole &quot;ugly American&quot; thing going on so I was able to make friends pretty quickly.<br /><br />Best of luck in what you decide to do.

				Me and the missus are talking about it seriously.<br /><br />That said, we are lucky we saved and its possible we can support ourselves but I would need work eventually but have a trade which is not common.<br /><br />The UK will go to shit fast.<br /><br />I live in the country but things are not the same, commuters have fucked up house prices so many natives children cannot afford to stay.<br /><br />Weather is depressing but I may pop some MDMA later on so its sunshine at midnight.<br /><br />Jeremy would rip me to bits.<br /><br />Bet he has done some yayo. I know people in the media and they spend BIG on the old coke.

				Lol nah I am not going anywhere where they speak fuckin English as a first language. I want a bit of fuckin culture and sun, U.S.A and Australia both go out the window because 1. I don&#039;t wana live somewhere where people are fatter than people in England and 2. I don&#039;t want to live somewhere where the Prime Minister can be called Kevin. I do like the U.S and Australia and had a very nice time when I visited them and would even go back to both but live there...couldn&#039;t hack it. <br /><br />Nah I wana go somewhere where I can flex my linguistic skills and be a proper expat. I want a country that has better family values than the U.K and U.S as well, want to have Mini-Lims one day and I think childhood is pretty broken in the U.K and it seems to be the same in the U.S as well, maybe worse actually. <br /><br />And I do love Britain but I don&#039;t necessarily like British society. I love the history, the eccentricities, raves and I quite like the Royal family as well because the Queen is like everyone&#039;s Nan. On the other hand though, the British government balls that all up for me because they do stupid shit like spy on us through the internet, have CCTV everywhere, have a shitty tax system, everything is fuckin dear (and I&#039;m not being a tight cunt on this), people who take drugs are demonized more than child molesters, the law (which is meant to protect us AND WE FUCKIN INVENTED THAT SHIT...no America, you can&#039;t rob that, you based your shit on us) oppresses us and stamps on our freedom and then treats people who should get a slap with some bullshit hippie attitude which makes everyone feel there is no hope and many other things I could list but I don&#039;t want to because it&#039;s too depressing. <br /><br />I do love Britain but you can&#039;t live in somethings history or it&#039;s eccentricities and although Liz is everyone&#039;s Nan I don&#039;t think she&#039;d be too up for me knockin out batches of Meph in the wine cellar of Buckingham Palace because the fumes might knock over her corgis and I wouldn&#039;t want that on my conscience. As such, I&#039;m off to a place where they can&#039;t wantonly spy on my browsing history and the rat-race isn&#039;t quite so intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I vote for moving to Spain.&nbsp; It is fucking beautiful there!&nbsp; Beautiful women, beautiful culture, weather, and best of all RELAXED drug laws!&nbsp; I really want to move there but unfortunately life, family, career and a minimal savings won&#039;t allow me just yet.&nbsp; Funny years ago I never thought Spain would be a place I&#039;d move to, but after visiting there, I day dream about it.&nbsp;

Yeah I love nature so much, I take photos and such on my old film camera. I`ve even climbed Mt.Fuji to the top several times. There is proper bud here, you just gotta meet me ;) You`re right though, its too risky dealing anything whether is be a citizen or Gaijin. Also I`m going to my hometown soon and they have Kiserus as well as Kizami. I`m willing to do a transaction for free (except the shipping costs) as a gesture of good faith.

				The Uk is pretty much a police state but with the TSA and the recent occupy movement America in some places like DC and New York are turning into a police stste your best bet is moving to the country. There are too many guns in the US for martial law to work and I for one would take as many of the pigs with me in case my country became like the UK. The UK took away everyones guns and ther are cameras all over london its just like 1984.

It&#039;s a simple and quite enjoyable way to pass the time. Bears on the other hand have fuckin claws and massive teeth and are stronger than Lions. Lions can rape you in the arse too if they have the chance, so anything that can beat a fuckin Lion can definitely rape me as well.
