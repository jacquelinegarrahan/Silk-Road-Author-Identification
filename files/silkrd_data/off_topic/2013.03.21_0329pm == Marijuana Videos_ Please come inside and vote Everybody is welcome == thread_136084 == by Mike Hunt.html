				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fl25bl_2cQ<br /><br />warning: This is a clearnet link so don&#039;t try to go there while you are logged into the TOR browser. I dont even have an account at you tube or google or face book. Fuck those privacy invading mother fuckers but I can watch a youtube vid with out signing up. <br /><br />The video I posted above is 15 minutes long and pretty cool. Please tell me your opinions if you want. I&#039;d love to hear it. Does anyone watch weed country on the discovery channel? Last nights episode really got me worked up. I don&#039;t see how these fuckers can go after non violent people who are growing a healing herb that was intended for us to use as we wish by God. Isn&#039;t there worse criminal types for them to be going after while using my tax dollars? <br /><br />I&#039;m gonna be posting more vids as we go as I find them. This one has only 851 views so far. Let me know if you have seen it. It&#039;s asinine the way the US government is wasting our tax dollars just because they want full control of the marijuana industry.

				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iksA-DD3990<br /><br />Does this video prove that marijuana cures cancer and prevents it in the first place?<br /><br />What does that say about a government that demonized a holy gift from our creator? Does it look as tho God is forcing the issue by condemning us with the plagues that is cured by Marijuana because of how it has been treated by those who push against it and use false propaganda saying it&#039;s evil?

				Marijuana, specifically the cannabinoid molecules within marijuana, are proven to have anti-cancer properties. Numerous medical studies from around the world have proven this medical fact for many years. And now,&nbsp; even the National Institute of Health has said that cannabinoids have anti-cancer properties. Now if our own NIH verifies the health benefits of marijuana, how can we still consider it a banned substance?<br /><br />Cannandinoids help the body to fight inflamation, kill unhealthy cells, prevent the growth of cancer cells. There is a great video on youtube about the cancer fighting abilities of marijuana. &quot;Clearing the Smoke&quot; and you will find the documentary. It&#039;s an hour long and one of the most educational videos anyone can watch. Completely based in science.<br /><br />Marijuana is truely a wonder drug. It&#039;s been used for health purposes by every culture that has indigenous cannabis plants, since the beginning of history. It has only been illegal for the past 70 years because of racist motivations by the US government. Medical marijuana will soon be legal in all 50 states and hopefully on a national and international level very soon. <br />

				I did see more and more information confirming that THC (not cannabis) could cure some forms of cancer, <br />IF eaten (not smoked) in very high quantities... <br />and that was already mentioned in very old hinduistic books (veda&#039;s) where&quot; bhaang&quot; was said to lengthen your life (curing cancer is lengthening your life, isn&#039;t it).<br /><br />In Canada more research has been done with THC to cure cancers, <br />so if you&#039;re interested you should be able to find lots of info on the clearnet.

				Actual peer reviewed science -&gt;<br />https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3358713/?tool=pubmed<br />&quot;Abstract<br />Recent advances in understanding of the mode of action of tetrahydrocannabinol and related cannabinoid in-gredients of marijuana, plus the accumulating anecdotal reports on potential medical benefits have spurred increasing re-search into possible medicinal uses of cannabis. Recent clinical trials with smoked and vaporized marijuana, as well as other botanical extracts indicate the likelihood that the cannabinoids can be useful in the management of neuropathic pain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis, and possibly other indications. As with all medications, benefits and risks need to be weighed in recommending cannabis to patients. We present an algorithm that may be useful to physicians in determining whether cannabis might be recommended as a treatment in jurisdictions where such use is permitted.&quot;<br /><br />I have allot more :) Happy to share

				I did an awful lot of research into what I term &#039;endocannabinoid therapy&#039;. Rick Simpson&#039;s method can be improved upon but the basic principle is fairly solid, the body&#039;s endocannabinoid system regulates most functions of the body&#039;s health. Immune system, bone metabolism and much more are mediated by the inernal cb1, cb2 and other cannabinoid receptors. From everything I have read cannabis can not damage this system but instead tends to create a peak performance state allowing the body to heal itself.<br /><br />To get technical cannabis does cure cancer. It triggers a Programmed Cell Death(PCD) in most forms of tumor. This was discovered by the US National Institute of Health in 1974 and then ignored.<br /><br />The problem with most medical applications of cannabis is volume, fucking around with 0.2g here and there is nothing. You need to eat 1g of concentrated cannabinoids per day. When you look at the lab trials with mice they tend to inject large amounts of THC or other isolated cannabinoids directly into the blood stream an this is the application that is efficacious in a curative capacity. It stands to reason that if one can ingest cannabinoids in high enough amounts reasonably directly into the blood stream some of these effects, particularly PCD could be replicated in humans.<br /><br />The cannabis community is VERY resistent to this information, they want to keep it to being used for minimising side effects from chemo as opposed to curing the cancer. I understand their skepticism but they simply have not done the necessary medical research, or seriously dabbled in application methods of concentrates.<br /><br />Rant over, sorry<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Agreed, ontop of that if you don&#039;t direct it to the right section it&#039;s not useful. People with colon cancer using the oil, rather than using defatted oil to make a glycerin enema and treating the affected area. <br /><br />Love for knowledge!

				Absolutely, I suspect Rick Simpson&#039;s 70% success rate is a direct result of improper application, there are a few digestive cancers it does not treat well and I suspect for example that sublingual triglycerides would be better for these than the traditional RSO application.<br /><br />Man glycerol suspensions under the tongue are soo strong, I can&#039;t imagine how much stronger it would be up the butt.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Hell yea +1 to CoinBoxsWeedBox and DoctorNoname<br /><br />Thanks guys for posting such educational info. This is the very reason I started this thread was to try to get people informed about the miracle of this plant. It&#039;s my intention to spread this message thru out the world as much as I can. I live in a closed minded region where it&#039;s still taboo to talk about marijuana in public. Mark Emory is one of my heroes.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t hesitate to write in this thread. I&#039;ll keep giving you + karma and even buy your products when I can. I&#039;m gonna do some checking up on you guys and if your doing things that are in league with my goals then I&#039;ll be donating to your accounts.<br /><br />also +1 to all who have posted here thank you and come back with info and opinions and please vote<br /><br />I also enjoy professionally grown mushrooms. Not trying to get off the subject but Is anyone else under the opinion that the images of highly magnified trichromes kind of look like the mushrooms? People who are experienced with eating cannabis know very well that there is a difference in eating it and smoking it. I ate 6 of those strawberry hash gummies at one time that I got from RosesGarden and It was more of a psychedelic experience that dilated my pupils. I did not have any kind of trips but it was a fabulous feeling of well being and euphoria.

				Just thought I would add that skin cancers can be treated with topical applictations.<br /><br />If you mix BHO products with coconut oil it makes a fantastic cream that works on most things but will cure skin cancer. Many caregivers recommend simply placing BHO straight onto the area and cover with a bandage.<br /><br />This is arguably the most convincing argument for cancer-curing properties as it can be easily photographed to demonstrate the remission.<br /><br />Mrs Doc has had skin cancer twice before I met her, so there is a chance I may get to test it out myself in the future. I guess this really isn&#039;t something I should be hoping for but willing participants for my human trials can be hard to come by<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Some great links confirming (as STB already knows) that cannabis does cure cancer. We have not only heard this for ourselves but seen it!

				If your mixing BHO into coconut oil, you can be aided by defatting / detarring. Get Everclear 190% proof, warm it slightly in a water bath, dissolve your BHO in, put into freezer for 48 hours, filter with a coffee filter (wet it first with everclear), participate out the ethanol ;) <br /><br />Now you have winterized BHO. Perfect for edibles / topicals.

				I had some 80%abv&nbsp; extract that was great for spraying on sore throats, it wouldn&#039;t have been much fun on the lungs though.<br /><br />I can easily make glycerin tinctures, just PM me if you are in the UK and I can do it as soon as I have BHO in stock, . The only reason I don&#039;t really sell it is that it takes me about 2 days to dissolve the BHO in the glycerin on the stirring hotplate and it would be a little awkard to bottle.<br /><br />I can&#039;t buy high proof neutral alcohol here and the best I get out of my pot still is about 80% from a second distillation so I can&#039;t do any defatting until I build myself a reflux still so I can get 95% neutrals.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in the UK, PM me, there isn&#039;t much I can&#039;t make out of weed<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Well if you ever want advice on how to make anything out of weed/concentrates just ask, most things can be made easily at home with the right techniques and SR means you can order concentrates, occasionally trim and stuff like that so you can make most of the stuff I can.<br /><br />About the only bit of equipment I have that is useful for making glycerin products is the hotplate/stirrer, but you can achieve the same thing with a double boiler, a spoon and some patience. <br /><br />All this talk reminds me, I&#039;ve got some glycerin sublingual lying around, maybe I should add a drop of lecithin, get it mixed and get buzzed...<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				CBD and THC have been shown to reduce the size of certain tumors including but not limited to malignant tumors. I believe this recent study was performed in a double blind study through Harvard. I would have to look this up again. Cooking with extracted oil in a olive oil is a good way to reduce the cancer sells and if it can reduce them it may be safe to say it kills them and gets rid of cancer. This is evident in clinical and many anecdotal studies of patients worldwide and as well in double blind studies. Smoking is always bad because smoke in any form increases cancer, even smoked fish. This is why there is a disproportionate amount of Norwegians with cancer, smoked fish. The best way to use cannabis for therapy is to ingest in orally with wood and proper diet. Cannabis alone cannot cure you unless you have the proper nutrition.

				Medical Grade: ~Cannabis Concentrate~ -<br />.............................**BIOAVAILABLE** <br />&nbsp;When working and talking with various patients across the globe, it doesn&#039;t take long to learn (and to agree, for good reason) that Rick Simpson&#039;s hemp oil is valued highly by those &#039;in the know&#039;. However, again with patients in the know, their biggest problem is that when it is made the &#039;traditional way&#039;, the potency and medicinal value that the resulting &#039;hemp oil&#039; concentrate contains, is simply not very bioavailable. <br />Meaning, that you pass most of it through your digestive tract, without absorption!<br />---------------<br />&nbsp;Even though it has been stripped from the inert plant matter, the potency is still not easily absorbed by the body; it bounces off cellular walls, and continues down your tract going &#039;in one end, and right out the other,&#039; without absorption!<br />&nbsp;-----------<br />Cannabis glandular material is notoriously difficult for the body to absorb, even if it has been activated, and even when it is in the form of a sticky filtered concentrate, such as BHO, or Rick Simpson&#039;s Oil. <br />It needs a &#039;vehicle&#039; such as oil, glycerin, or even alcohol, which drastically improves cellular permeability, in order to provide you with the most absorption and the strongest sensations. <br /><br />When you process in oil gently, for long enough, a solution is formed in such a way when the solvent (in this case, oil) creates a persistent &#039;coat&#039; on the broken down particles of the solute (cannabis glandular material)... once this occurs, you have a bioavailable &#039;solution&#039;. In other words, we choose the edible solvents we do, not only because they are effective at breaking down cannabis glandular material, but because they help our bodies absorb it!<br /><br />The specific oil source that you choose, dictates where in the body your oil is absorbed; This is also why the quality of oil matters, as well. Unless you know for a fact that your liver does not function properly, and that it consistently over-metabolizes both food and medications, you should start with medium-chain containing oils such as coconut oil and palm kernal oil, or to a lesser extent, clarified butter. These oils deliver potency via the portal vein and liver, where a kind of chemical conversion takes place as the liver metabolizes the oil, causing the majority of the Delta 9-THC to convert to the more powerful 11-OH-THC!!<br /><br />Choose the wrong oil, however, and you miss out on most, if not all of that conversion... which results in a much weaker, shorter-lived experience.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Common kitchen cooking oils such as olive, corn, canola and soy should be avoided, due to their long-chain triglyceride content, UNLESS you are one of the very rare people with a liver that consistently over-metabolizes cannabinoids. In this case I would suggest using either olive, grapeseed (low temps only), or sesame oils, because long-chain <br />&nbsp;cooking oils promote lymphatic absorption, meaning they almost entirely bypass the liver all together. <br /><br />It is a little known fact that you can achieve a RANGE of effects and results, depending how well you activate your material, and depending how bioavailable your oil is.<br /><br />A single strain, is not limited to providing only a &#039;single type&#039; of experience when it is eaten, like it generally provides when it is smoked. <br /><br />Edible cannabis can be more like vaporization, it can provide a range of experiences depending how you treat it, and the possibilities can be much greater than smoking, or even vaping! <br />&nbsp;<br />----------------<br /><br />The below describes the &#039;range&#039; of effects provided by different levels of activation, their benefits, and the desired outcome for the patients who choose them.<br /><br />Starting with:<br />The least activation, producing a bioavailable solution of mostly carboxyl-intact acid components; Continuing right through to decarboxylation, and active cannabinoids and chemicals, free of their carboxyl groups; And finally finishing with degradation and the byproducts of degraded THC. <br /><br />1.) - Some patients require &#039;inactive&#039; but bioavailable THCA, CBNA, CBDA and the other (to us) &#039;inactive acids&#039;, and in flowers those doses can range from .05g to as high as 4.5g, without &#039;doping up&#039; or intoxicating a patient much, if at all even at the highest doses. These are cold tinctures, processed with material that is as fresh as possible, without decarbing.<br />&nbsp;Cold, but most importantly bioavailable extractions (more than just &#039;juicing&#039; plant matter is required!), provide powerful anti-cancer/mutagenic, anti-seizure/spasmodic benefits and they provide wonderful pain relief without reducing sensation of touch, they reduce swelling and inflammation even in lower doses, and especially at higher doses, and they provide especially wonderful relief for specifically for MS, Parkinson&#039;s, as well as for generally frail patients, and also for those suffering from seizures. <br /><br />Where it takes literally only a day or two to build up a tolerance to the highest of doses, and these oils and tinctures do not make a person feel overwhelmed, they are wonderful for treating patients who suffer from very powerful seizures, and similar attacks. Cannabis is incredibly non-toxic, an incredibly larger dose may be given to both provide relief, and <br />to control the symptoms of more intense attacks, preventing further injury. These oils and tinctures are also somewhat mood elevating, but still, for the most part it&#039;s without that medicated feeling. You will have very good pain relief, without losing your sensation of touch.<br /><br /><br />2.) - The first sensations (following a cold tincture that has had no activation) of an oil or tincture with only limited or partial activation and decent bioavailability, are primarily cerebral. <br />&nbsp;In higher doses, these under-processed edibles can cause some mild anxiety and even paranoia in some patients; hyperventilating, &#039;room-spins&#039;, racing-mind/thoughts, even vomiting, these are not uncommon side-effects of over-consumption of THC and trace amounts of THCA, when they are consumed in quantity, minus some of the important experience-regulating byproducts, of degradation. <br /><br /><br />3.) - Then, some patients want to feel relaxed, nicely buzzed but still functional, and they need something that elevates their mood without gluing them to the couch. In which case edibles decarbed and processed in oil,&nbsp; are a great place to start. For those first starting out with edibles, I make sure their first few doses are about half of what they&#039;d normally smoke in a single session, or in a single day if they are heavy smokers. Once they know what to expect, the average dose most people are satisfied with (but at the sane time they are not too overwhelmed by), is right around the same amount used in a 24 hour period. It&#039;s strong enough to either keep them from smoking quite as much in a day, or it actually out-right replaces their smoking for the day. So if you smoke a gram a day, you&#039;ll want to eat between a half gram, to a gram in a well-processed edible. I like to split my daily dose into two to three smaller doses. Sometimes I take them in quick succession, sometimes I spread them out, and finish with a &#039;sleeper&#039;... Deciding what level of processing you need, can be the tricky part.<br /><br /><br />4.) - The longer you heat in oil (to a certain extent, up to four or five hours), the more &#039;body intensive&#039; the sensations will become, without a noticeable diminish in potency.&nbsp; At these levels of activation you have highly effective pain relief, that can sometimes be powerful enough to effect sensitivity to touch.... for instance if you have a low tolerance, you may notice that you become clumsy, or &#039;loose and wobbly&#039; on well-activated oil, you may lose some sensation of touch. Four to six hours in oil at 220 f, or longer, and I&#039;m either stuck to the couch, or falling fast asleep! <br /><br /><br />5.) Any longer than a few hours at such temperatures will reduce THC content. But while &#039;perceived potency&#039; diminishes, and the ratio of THC begins to fall, the material becomes overloaded with byproducts of degraded THC, primarily in the form of delta-8-THC and CBN, and when combined they are powerfully sedative. While their effects may seem weak during the time you can keep your eyes open, these oils and tinctures usually knock a patient out cold within 45 - 60 minutes, leaving them well rested upon waking the following morning (or afternoon)!<br /><br />************************************************** ***********<br /><br /><br /><br />This tutorial provides SUPERIOR results, to traditionally extracted &#039;hemp oil&#039;, because;<br /><br />**It takes activation into consideration.<br />** It takes bioavailability and absorption into consideration, meaning much more of your valuable medicine is actually delivered throughout your body!<br />** It uses 100% FOOD GRADE solvents and materials!!! With lab testing becoming more common, we are discovering more and more, that even the best purging methods do not provide results that are as complete, or as clean, as we first assumed. <br /><br />For it to be a truly medical-grade product, you do not want traces of the harmful byproducts produced by non-food-grade solvents, to remain in your medicine.<br /><br />************************************************** ***********<br /><br />- Medical Grade: ~Cannabis Concentrate~ - <br />Preface:<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel comfortable calling this a &#039;hash extract&#039; or hash concentrate, because for this tutorial, I am showing how to get a bit more out of the plant, beyond what we usually consider the normal medicinal (ie. psychoactive/sedative) components. The faster you rinse, the more &#039;pure&#039; your end product will be.<br /><br />That being said.....<br />&nbsp;Many people pay between ten and fifty dollars per bottle, for simple chlorophyll plant extracts!<br /><br />By allowing for a longer wash, we can pick up a good amount of chlorophyll, waxes and plant salts (which we&#039;d USUALLY want to avoid, for cooking/flavor purposes) and retain them for our own oils for improved digestion and skin treatments, along with the bonus of extracting a slightly greater amount of the potency we seek.&nbsp; These oils are best for topical uses, capsules, and peanut butter chocolate recipes, but if the plant matter has been decarbed thoroughly beforehand, many people do not find long-soaked extracts offensive for sweet, fruity or minty candies! <br /><br />In order to improve purity, potency-wise, you just simply need to wash/rinse faster, don&#039;t soak the material for as long, and to not give in to the temptation to squeeze the plant matter to get out the last of the alcohol... just let it pass through. You will remove less overall potency this way, meaning some will be left behind, but you have control over the purity of at least your first extraction.&nbsp; You may then save that &#039;waste&#039; plant matter to make additional runs using fresh alcohol, to retrieve the remaining potency, and additional plant extracts. <br />&nbsp;<br />I will be walking you through creating two concentrates: <br /><br />- An edible oil concentrate<br />&nbsp;- And a smokable/vapable concentrate<br /><br />If you would like to use the latter in your vape, you may, but be forewarned that depending on the style of vape the &#039;extra&#039; plant matter can make your device a bit dirtier, a little more quickly than usual. A quick wash is best for vaping, but a long wash still provides tasty results... just a slightly messier aftermath.<br /><br />I make small batches semi frequently, and I will set aside an incompletely-scraped dish of &#039;smokable&#039; concentrate, to be used with oil for the following batch of &#039;edible&#039; concentrate. The oil lifts the material from the plate very easily, so rather than troubling myself with a complete scrape (and where the smoking concentrate is only a &#039;bonus&#039;, or secondary/side goal), I just alternate dishes, and clean the one that was last used for making oil.<br /><br />So each dish makes a smoking concentrate, then immediately after, an edible concentrate, then once the oil is collected, the dish gets sterilized, and the process starts over! When I finish up for the day, I just add a little oil to the final &#039;smoking&#039; dish, process it, collect it, then clean. During busier days, without much effort you can easily make a couple hundred doses using minimal tools, average sized dishes, and that simple system. <br /><br />You will need:<br />- 2 pyrex/glass pie or casserole dishes (only 1 is required; 2 if you&#039;re making both)<br />- 1 + cup 190 proof grain/drinking alcohol, such as Everclear<br />- 1 large measuring cup or glass<br />- A simple double boiler<br />- Cheesecloth<br />- A fine Hemp or paper filter, or coffee filter<br />- 1 Tbsp coconut oil MINIMUM (for the suggested amount of material below)<br />- Pinch lecithin, to half a teaspoon<br />- Canning jar<br />- Spatula scraper<br />- 1 - 2+ oz&#039;s of well-ground material; this can be anything from trim, to your finest flowers...it can even be sifted hash, however with an oz and a half of hash, you will want to use much more coconut oil! The better the material you use, the more you&#039;ll collect in the end, and the higher the potency per gram, or unit of weight. <br />Again, I&#039;m just telling you what I used, see the end of the tutorial for help adjusting your own dose.<br /><br />Again: For suggested **DOSAGE INSTRUCTIONS** and oil-to-herb ratios, see below.<br />Optional, but -required- for heated evaporation: An oscillating fan.<br /><br />***SAFETY WARNING***<br />Without a fan, only utilize a slow-paced evaporation near an open window, until all but the very smallest amount of alcohol has dissipated. Then you may complete it in the oven, if you like. ONLY use heated and rapid evaporation methods from the start, if you have both good ventilation AND a fan. This will prevent dense pockets of -volatile and explosive alcohol fumes- from forming. If you can not meet those requirements, evaporate near an open window at room temp, it should be gone in less than 24 hours. Then you may add oil for edible processing, or you can scrape and smoke or vape the concentrate.<br /><br />*** If you have a gas-only oven, do NOT attempt any of the heated portions of this recipe! Simply use an electric hot plate, or utilize a longer soak, and evaporate in the open air until nearly all alcohol has vanished. ***<br /><br />I know it may seem silly to some of us: but if anyone is, for any reason, unsure how their oven operates, do NOT use it to evaporate alcohol. <br />

				Part two--&gt;<br /><br />-----------------------<br />- First, decarb your material - if you are making it for smoking purposes ONLY, you may SKIP this step. <br /><br />If you are making a dual batch, it&#039;s better to decarb than not to decarb at this stage. You only lose a tiny bit of potency when smoking, and next to none when vaping if you decarb first, but if you were not to pre-decarb a batch meant for cooking, it&#039;s a bit more difficult to do so later on. Almost every time I make it, I just like to reserve a little bit... maybe 1/3 - 1/4 of the batch.... for smoking. Just as a treat, and a bowl-topper. <br /><br />- Once you&#039;ve decarbed, mentally divide it into 4 or more portions (more, if you&#039;re using 2oz&#039;s or more). Dividing it into portions allows you to use less alcohol, to soak more material. You will saturate one portion, squeeze and strain, then use that alcohol to saturate several additional portions. Pouring a cup of alcohol into several oz&#039;s of herb makes straining and recovery much more difficult. <br /><br />- Prepare your double boiler with, besides the water between the two pots, enough water to fill the inner pot about half way, as well. Leave on medium heat. Either remove water from the base pot or lower the temp, if it&#039;s too agitated or boiling over. <br /><br />- For later, prepare your large measuring cup or glass, with four layers of folded cheesecloth, and a rubber band.<br /><br />- Add one cup of 190 proof grain alcohol into a large canning jar, place the lid on loosely, then sit in the water bath for 3 - 4 minutes to heat up. <br /><br />- Remove the jar from the bath.<br /><br />- Take your first portion of decarbed material, pour it into the jar. Seal the lid well, then shake the herb in the warm alcohol for 10 seconds. Re-lid loosely.<br /><br />Add to your double boiler. Let heat for 45 - 60 seconds, longer if you want a lot more chlorophyll, and a bit more potency. <br /><br />&nbsp;--------------<br /><br />If you replicate this exposure to heat and alcohol as closely as possible, it is safe to say that your waste material will contain less than 1/15 - 1/20 the potency it once had, before you began. In other words it&#039;s safe to assume that you should be removing WELL over 95% of the potency. (I&#039;ll explain a little from my and a close acquaintance&#039;s personal experience, at the end of the tutorial...)<br /><br />If you wish to soak longer, you may. Just know that the return is only slightly higher, while the amount of inert plant matter to enter the wash, increases exponentially, after such a long soak. Trace amounts of potency will invariably be left behind after straining. If you choose, you may save the remains and wash again with fresh alcohol, then save that batch for future use with new material.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />- Once you&#039;ve soaked and heated your material adequately, strain by pouring the bulk of the liquid through the cheese cloth, at first leaving the soggy plant matter behind. You will then want to divide even this small portion, into three or so smaller portions, so you can squeeze every last drop possible from the material. If you squeeze too much material all at once, you leave a surprising amount of liquid behind (this is evident after squeezing as MUCH as possible from a larger portion, then diving it into smaller portions and squeezing each again, only to find even more liquid can be removed).<br /><br />And just remember, if you want it &#039;pure&#039;, don&#039;t squeeze!... <br /><br />Just leave that alcohol behind for the following wash, to extract a &#039;dirtier&#039; concentrate. <br /><br />--------------<br />&nbsp;<br />Now, repeat this process accordingly with all the remaining portions, using your increasingly more green, and gold tinted alcohol. When you are on your last batch, pre-heat your oven, to 180 f. <br /><br />If you have a gas-only oven, skip this step. <br />--------------<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve finished straining your last batch through the cheesecloth, it&#039;s time to get out your fine filter.<br />Set it up in a metal strainer or colander, over a clean glass. Now, slowly pour your (what would now, be) fresh but unfinished &#039;Green Dragon&#039; through the filter. <br />&nbsp;Depending how well you used your cheesecloth, this may take more or less time. Do not be tempted to squeeze the filter until the very end! It&#039;s possible to create a &#039;bubble&#039; of alcohol and press it out faster, but do so at your own risk.... if you burst your bubble, you have to start all over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;You&#039;ll notice that your filter collects what looks like good kief... but don&#039;t be fooled, and don&#039;t wonder &quot;why it didn&#039;t work&quot;!<br /><br />They do contain some small amount of potency, by these are actually mostly-emptied and depleted &#039;trichome husks&#039;...these are the cuticle heads and stalks that once contained most of your potency. Now, it has been for the most part extracted. These husks do NOT instantly dissolve once they are emptied, they remain intact for long period of time long after their contents have been either removed, or degraded.&nbsp; The heads disintegrate more rapidly than the stalks, but in fact, we actually (however, rarely) find fully-intact and structurally unharmed trichome stalks, missing their heads, with some otherwise-fossilized plants.<br />-------------- <br /><br />Depending on the desired strength of your caps, and how much material you used, melt one to four Tbsp coconut oil. Without knowing you personally as a patient, or your level of tolerance, I will not suggest a specific amount:<br /><br />However - ***Detailed dosage &#039;advice&#039; and suggested oil-to-extract ratios are included at the end of this tutorial. ***<br />&nbsp;Again, I can not suggest that you use specific ratios without knowing certain information, except to say that I like my capsules and oil strong and concentrated.<br /><br />If you&#039;re serious about curing cancer, and you have built up a ridiculously high tolerance, you still need to use at least between 7 and 10 Tbsp coconut oil, per lb (pound) of your highest quality herb. Any less oil, and you run the risk of sacrificing absorption or bioavailability. <br /><br />Capsules (even a single capsule) made at the above level of potency should be kept far away from all users who historically only smoke or eat less than a few grams, per day. The capsules will each be capable of housing the concentrated potency from&nbsp; up to 3 - 4 grams of quality herb. And again, this is all variable depending on the length of wash, and the potency of the herb you&#039;re starting with. <br /><br />---------------<br /><br />With one batch of herb you may need more or less per dose, than with the next batch. And the number of grams/ml of potency extracted, per any unit of weight will also vary, and this alone can increase or decrease your total capsule count when using the same amount of oil. <br /><br />But all that being said, a Tbsp of oil per oz of good bud, will still be MORE than strong enough for 70% - 80% of the end-users. If you&#039;re looking for a very, very strong experience, start there, and remember that you should &#039;feed your liver&#039; at least once, no sooner, than 2 - 6 hours before taking your dose.<br /><br />And again, slightly more helpful advice for determining dosage is included at the end of the tutorial.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />- Now take your pie or casserole dishes, and be sure that you remember which dish is which, if you are making two batches. <br />I&#039;ve used just under 2oz&#039;s of primarily reasonably-frosty trim, and a few little buds, all of which has been curing in jars, for over 4 months.&nbsp; <br />Due to the advanced age of the trim, while keeping in mind that it was stored well, my decarb was slightly more brief (18 minutes at 220 f, and ten or so minutes in the hot oven after shutting off the heat.) In this particular batch I will be using slightly under a Tbsp of oil, for between 2/3rds - 3/4ths of my extract, or just around 1.5 ozs of herb. <br />&nbsp;That&#039;s right; all the potency of over an oz and a half of material, concentrated into just a spoonful of oil!<br /><br />The remaining 1/3 of the extract is evaporated for smoking purposes.<br />&nbsp;--------------<br />&nbsp;- The oil and the larger portion of the extract are whisked together, and then placed in the oven at 180 f, along-side the extract meant for smoking. Depending on the humidity, it will take roughly 25 - 30 minutes with occasional manual agitation to evaporate the smoking extract, and 40 - 50 minutes to evaporate the alcohol from the oil batch. <br /><br />After evaporation. Before heating further, add your lecithin now:<br /><br />Smokable:<br /><br />After you notice layers of &#039;color&#039; forming in your smokable dish, and it appears sticky but very &#039;dry&#039;, remove and allow it to cool on your countertop, on a heat-safe pot holder or trivet.<br />&nbsp;(Do NOT place on the stove top, especially if you have recently used, or plan to use a burner... people have shattered their dishes and lost all their material this way!). <br />Once it&#039;s cooled, freeze it... in a half hour or so it should be cool enough to scrape easily from the dish. Scraping immediately from the oven is possible, but can be challenging.<br /><br />Edible:<br /><br />Following evaporation, add lecithin, then freeze the oil for four - six hours.<br /><br />&nbsp;After spending at least four hours in the coldest section of your freezer (near the ice-cube maker, or on the rack/location intended for ice-cube trays), allow it to thaw until room temp. Placing it in the oven immediately after being frozen can shock and break your glass! Once thawed (it will be solid), if you have not already you may ***sprinkle with your lecithin and then SEAL WELL WITH FOIL***, and continue heating your oil at 220 f for an additional 60 - 80 minutes, before cooling it, and then finally either setting it aside for baking, or for inserting into capsules. <br />I prefer one more 40 minute interval at 220 f, along with another freeze between the two heatings, this may put some users to sleep, or it may give them the pain relief and strength they are looking for. It will absolutely provide strong sensations, but it may take a few batches for you to figure out exactly the range of effects and potency you&#039;re after.<br />The level of processing above, -minus the additional 40 minutes-, will allow for a very a strong, upbeat and motivational &#039;cerebral effect&#039; with decent pain relief, and maybe a bit of couch-lock at times... but it should still be processed enough to keep you positive and anxiety-free, without putting you to sleep, just so long as you don&#039;t take too much! <br />(Under-processing, or processing any less than described here, can potentially cause some patients -mild anxiety-, in higher doses.)<br />If you want a narcotic, sleepy, and irresistibly couch-locked stone, that is good for later in the day, then you should continue heating and freezing in 40 minute (heat) and minimum 4 hour (freeze) intervals, as many as you choose, up to a total of 5 or so hours of heat, depending on the effects you&#039;re after. You will likely be glued to your chair, after processing much more than 2 - 3 additional hours.<br /><br />Just keep in mind: Towards the end of a very extended, longer process, you may notice a slight -decrease- in perceived potency, and almost no heady, cerebral effects whatsoever.<br />However, you should also notice that much of your pain will vanish, accompanied by an almost total-inability to keep your eyes open, beginning about forty minutes to an hour after taking your capsule!&nbsp; Over-processed capsules may be &#039;weaker&#039; in some ways, but they are amazing for sleep!<br /><br />In most scenarios I would recommend non-colored capsules... there&#039;s really no reason to use or consume &#039;artificial coloring&#039; where it isn&#039;t needed. It is however useful for remembering which batch is which. <br /><br />The smokable concentrate... it&#039;s often almost rock solid when cold or low-room-temp, so I&#039;ll pry off a chunk, then flatten it out between my thumbnails, and make a thin hole in the center... it melts and burns SO nicely this way!<br />--------------<br /><br />**** Dosing Advice****:<br /><br />&nbsp;This particular batch, using 1.5oz&#039;s of somewhat frosty trim, made just about 19 ridiculously potent capsules.<br /><br />Four of which were immediately tested, and split between myself and three patients&nbsp; They were a bit &#039;too- successful&#039; for some of us *grin*.... The additional half oz of frosty-leaf extract made just under a gram of concentrate, to smoke. Which means, between three and four grams of concentrate went into those 19 capsules! <br /><br />Which makes sense, because; 1 Tbsp oil = 15 capsules, That, plus three to four grams of concentrate = 19 capsules.<br /><br />Just remember that 1 Tbsp of oil, all alone and without glandular material, will fill about 15 x 00-size capsules. Now, mentally add roughly another 3 - 5 capsules (sometimes more, or sometimes less depending on the quality/potency of the material) per oz of high-quality herb used, for the space taken up by the concentrate itself. If you know your usual edible dose is normally only a half a gram, then a single capsule from a batch that made 15 + 5 (20) capsules will be way, WAY too powerful! <br /><br />*** The point***:<br />You will want to eat roughly the same, or less than you would smoke over the course of a single session, or a single day if you are a frequent/heavy user.<br />&nbsp;- If half a gram of herb, is your ideal dose, then you want about 56 doses per oz.<br /><br />In which case, you&#039;re going to want to use roughly 3 and 1/2 Tbsp coconut oil, for 52 total 00-size capsules, combined with the capsule-space the concentrate itself will take up, to make roughly 55 - 56 doses.<br /><br />- If only a third of a gram is your ideal dose, then you will want to make 84 capsules or doses per oz. In which case, by using just over 5 Tbsp coconut oil, combined with your oz-worth of concentrate, you should be able to make 82 - 88 capsules (again, it varies, depending on the total glandular content of the oz/material used).<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />To fix meds which are too powerful/strong:<br />I would suggest filling a single capsule half-way, or fully, to take right away, before you fill any more, just to be certain that your entire batch of capsules do not come out much stronger, than you need them to be. If it&#039;s too strong, just relax and try to enjoy yourself. Then, when you&#039;re able to, just cut the remaining oil with a little more melted coconut oil. <br /><br />If instead, it&#039;s too weak (or you accidentally add too much additional coconut oil), you can choose to either simply take two caps per dose as needed, or you may save your oil until you make a second, stronger batch, and then combine the two. <br /><br />Once you&#039;ve made your second or third batch, it becomes like second nature, and it&#039;s very easy to create a perfect batch every single time!<br /><br />&nbsp;-------------<br /><br />Briefly:&nbsp; I was not located near the majority of the medical community, but I had the same curiosity many of us do: I wonder how much potency am I extracting from my plant matter with &#039;X/amount-processing&#039;? <br />After walking an old friend out west, through a few successful batches, I instructed him to go through the same process, using 6 very different batches of herb, containing three different local strains/samples of varying cannabinoid/potency content above 14% thc, but no higher than 19 - 20%. <br /><br />They were divided into 6 portions, three decarbed, three non-decarbed. Each portion/subject was again divided, into three or four smaller portions, for a series of individual washes. <br />Keeping in mind that the first portion washed, contains the least remaining potency, and the final batch washed (with already-potentiated alcohol) leaves the most behind due to the increased concentration and potency content within the wash, I had him send a portion of the -blended/combined- remaining &#039;waste&#039; herb from each individual batch off to a nearby lab for analysis. <br /><br />Those that had been decarbed tested positive for varying amounts totaling less than 0.80%, primarily THC, and a very minute fraction of THCA. Those that had not been decarbed also tested positive for both THCA, and in much smaller quantity, THC, and combined again, less than 0.80%.... all numbers were not 0.80%, some were much lower.<br /><br />Using the highest number I can remember, and assuming for the most waste possible, I think gives folks the most &#039;realistic&#039; expectations.<br /><br />We did this with oil extractions as well to determine how complete the extraction could be, with similar results; the more oil you use, the more diluted it is, and the less potency you leave behind. And the less oil you use initially, the more concentrated the resulting oil is, and slightly increased traces of potency are left behind due to that increased concentration. That&#039;s why it can be good to use a rather large volume of alcohol, with small divided portions, and why it&#039;s good a good idea to run more unadulterated oil through a batch of already oil-extracted <br />herb.<br /><br />&nbsp;I realize the above was a bit wordy, just in case it was a bit too overwhelming to comprehend, I&#039;ll break it down into quick steps. Combined with the above, you should be able to sort things out:<br /><br />The Basics: <br />- Grind and decarb as described in past tutorials;<br />- Divide into small portions<br />- Soak each portion individually, in warmed alcohol, for 1+/- minutes (less for more purity, longer for more impotent but healthy plant matter, cold for &#039;inactive/acid&#039; oils).<br />- Strain through cheesecloth, repeat with each portion until finished.<br />- Once last portion has been strained through cheese cloth, strain the potent alcohol once more through your fine filter.<br />- Add coconut oil to your dish for edible oil, but do not add it if you plan to smoke or vape.<br />- Add your alcohol, then allow to evaporate as required by your situation; with adequate fans and ventilation you may use the oven at 180 f or lower, and without adequate ventilation, just sit by an open window, away from heat and flames.<br />- Once evaporated, either cool, then freeze and scrape your concentrate made for smoking, or add your lecithin, freeze for several hours, then reheat for 90 minutes to 3 or more hours, depending on the desired outcome described above.<br />- Inject into capsules, or make into edibles, and enjoy!<br />

				Some people are so brain washed with the false propaganda that it&#039;s gonna take beating them in the head with the evidence of the truth for years before they&#039;ll finally surrender to the fact that MJ is not harmful at all. The only thing that even makes it a gateway drug is the fact that it&#039;s illegal still yet in a lot of places. That fact puts it into the hands of dealers who deal other worse stuff and so yea when you have to get your weed from the streets then you are gonna run into other drugs while trying to find the healing herb. <br /><br />Here&#039;s hoping I get the chance to travel to the places where MJ is legal and a part of everyday normal society. I really don&#039;t see it happening here before I am dead but I can always hope and try to think it into being.<br /><br />

The only reason cannabis is labelled a gateway drug is that dealers happen to sell pills, powders and who knows what else too on top of cannabis. Legalize it, tax it and we all win, right?

				I think so yea because that would also make it more affordable and would keep it from being so profitable to cartels and syndicates. What else is instead of our taxes going for the eradication of MJ and for housing innocent people in our jails we could have a booming Hemp industry and climb out of the debt hole. Yea it seems like a win win to me but big pharmacy and insurance stands to be the real losers along with the DEA who would lose a yearly 15 billion dollar fund from the government (our taxes) so they can eradicate weed and in prison innocent people.<br /><br />It seems to me that is the biggest reasons why it remains illegal on the federal level but they can&#039;t ignore the tax dollars it has been bringing in from dispensaries. I hear that one dispensary alone paid the government 3 million in taxes in one year. Now if it were legal across the board then the prices would drop and the taxes would be less for each individual dispensary but it would actually be more taxes paid because there would be a whole lot more dispensaries. Don&#039;t the government have a patent on marijuana since 2003? <br /><br />Our government is a cartel in my opinion but I say fuck it. I mean they want full control of anything that makes the kind of money that Marijuana makes. Just like the CIA took over the cocaine market in the 80&#039;s. I don&#039;t care if they have control as long as they would allow us to have it. Hell it&#039;s not like cocaine or heroin or LSD or crystal meth yet they have it as a schedule 1 in my state just like those drugs and say it has no medicinal value but who is so blind that they can&#039;t see the lives being destroyed by the drugs that they do allow?&nbsp; Mother fuck man I see people getting cut off their roxy 30&#039;s cold turkey and they fucking lose it! Going crazy acting retarded and robbing and stealing, coming up with all kinds of con games and they simply wont shut the fuck up ya know? They crazy and people who smoked for 5 or ten years can quit MJ and not be like that at all or at least I did as a matter of fact Marijuana is what helped me to beat my addictions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll always say it with pride: Thank you God for Marijuana. You can call it Hemp if you want I mean the fucking country was built on it. Where the pentagon stands now used to be a huge hemp field and it was the nations number one cash crop legally and it still is illegally. Rick Simpson may be right about getting people to stop using the word marijuana and start using the word hemp more often to identify it when talking about it but to me the word does not make it bad or good it&#039;s the way the person who speaks it is thinking about it and how they say it. To me the word &quot;Marijuana&quot; Is a beautiful word that identifies it truthfully and sounds better than &quot;Hemp&quot; or &quot;Indian Hemp&quot; but both words are ethnic in nature one being of a native American tongue and the other being of Spanish descent but I don&#039;t really care because to me America is still the melting pot and borders are bull shit. Maybe I&#039;m too free minded.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Whew Lord forgive me for this coming off as a rant and believe me when I say I would back Rick Simpson 200% I loved to watch that seminar he spoke at. He was great and Braver than most people and told the truth

				Please vote in the poll I&#039;d like to see everybody vote for the legalization of marijuana but vote anyway if you are against it. I&#039;d love to see what the majority is thinking on this most important movement in the history of mankind

This herb can be eaten, smoked, vaped, used as a topical ointment, and more!<br /><br />What effects would it&nbsp; or does it have on the economy? Can we bring back the hemp industry?<br /><br />

				Has anyone seen discovery&#039;s new show called POT COPS?&nbsp; Fresh on the heels of Weed Country is a new show that specifically centers on the police side of the &quot;Drug War&quot;&nbsp; It is interesting to get a glimpse into the massive grow scene in the Emerald Triangle.

I know it&#039;s dangerous over there tho because of the thieves trying to steal people&#039;s gardens. The police are not really helping things much. They are like a dawg after a bone. The more weed they eradicate then the better chance they have of getting more funds for it so it&#039;s their payday and their kids christmas and everything for them so of course their gonna be like that.
