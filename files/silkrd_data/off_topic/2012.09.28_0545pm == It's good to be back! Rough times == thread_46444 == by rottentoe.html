I have older kids somewhere in the teen years. While out getting ready for vacation they decided it&#039;d be so fucking funny to prank call 911. These are older kids who should of known the fuck better. Anyways, cops come, threaten to shoot the dog to get them to open the door then they proceeded to go through the whole house, including a locked laundry room and then a false wall. I thought we could use warrant issues because they got the warrant a few hours later while we were already at the cop station. I think the best we can do is go with a diversion so we don&#039;t get records. Fuck it sucks man..&nbsp; Neither of us have records, or have ever even hurt anyone. Harper Our MP wants to throw us in with fucking rapist and murderers over weed! And because I have kids, they were taken to Grandmas for two weeks while I had to prove I did not smoke weed with a strand test. I passed because I don&#039;t smoke, but what the fuck is wrong smoking some weed and hanging out with kids? I hate our laws
