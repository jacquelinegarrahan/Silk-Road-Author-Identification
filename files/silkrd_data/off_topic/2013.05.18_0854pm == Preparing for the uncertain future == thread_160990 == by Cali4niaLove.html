				I am not going to get into a big political debate and I am not interested if anyone wants to start one. <br /><br />The way I see it, you are either on one side of the fence or the other:<br /><br />A) &quot;Everything is totally going to be okay in the next 20 years, I don&#039;t have very much to worry about&quot;<br /><br />OR<br /><br />B) &quot;I see what&#039;s going on and I am preparing for any scenario&quot;<br /><br />Now, we know that SR is HIGHLY frequented by the Feds. If you don&#039;t think so, you are denial. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they have 24 hour monitoring on this website and forums. <br /><br />I AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYBODY TO SHARE ANY PERSONAL OR SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN THIS THREAD<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know who I am, check out my vendor profile on the Road. I recently retired from vending because I see what is happening. The government is trying to get a stranglehold on the internet, BTC, SR, gun ownership, etc etc. I decided to get out before the noose closed around my neck. <br /><br />I have been talking with the people closest to me and we are preparing our own personal Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, etc etc. <br /><br />No, we are not going to rise up and fight the government. We may be paranoid but we&#039;re not stupid. It&#039;s too late for that. They control all electronic communications and they have far more firepower and organization than any group of people could ever hope to fight against.<br /><br />I am looking to bounce ideas around with like-minded people who aren&#039;t blind and are actively preparing for multiple possible scenarios. <br /><br />TORMAIL: cali4nialove@tormail.org<br /><br />Or shoot me a PM. If anyone else wants to join the conversation, feel free to post your preferred method of contact as well.&nbsp;
