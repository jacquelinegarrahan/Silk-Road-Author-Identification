				The people I know have an absurdly negative view of LSD. They lump it together with PCP and heroin. They&#039;ll gladly take weed, cocaine, and even magic mushrooms, but they are terrified of LSD.<br /><br />Why are people so afraid of LSD, even people who take other psychedelics?

				I think there are two main issues. First, ignorance. Collect some reputable web pages to show them. The fact is, LSD is extremely safe. I think any reasonable person who actually looks at the available information will agree.<br /><br />The second issue, at least for me, is that it&#039;s been really hard to relate my experiences, even to very good friends, even when I really struggle to write down my feelings.

				That is a bit of a corundum most people that I know who are afraid of LSD are afraid of Mushrooms as well as most other psychedelics as well (excluding weed) they also are okay with cocaine,pills, and of course the all famous beer&amp;tobacco. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you say they are not afraid of (Psilocybin)mushrooms?are they in fear of them psychically i.e addiction,dependence etc. or is it more that they are afraid of them mentally(psychologically) ? To a certain extent magic mushrooms scare me a little more than LSD it is a much more spiritual,Introspective and deep trip for me but that is all subjective. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it is the first one the solution is as easy as your friends are stubborn to 50 years of consistent data stating LSD is less harmless than sugar and all that factual info. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it is the second problem than the solution is a bit more complex I first of course repeat with solution #1 just to show them that it is harmless and then from there offer them some. If they decline do not persist just do it yourself and show them that there is no danger by example, Be as open with them as possible and show them you are just the same as you were before and eventually that will &quot;hopefully&quot; lead to them wanting to try it with you and realize that it is not dangerous first hand :)

				I hope I can give some perspective from someone who doesn&#039;t like psychedelics.<br /><br /><br />With me, at least..&nbsp; Things like LSD and mushrooms give me an uncomfortable body load.&nbsp; They also exacerbate any kind of paranoia/anxiety that I tend to experience normally.&nbsp; I can take between 15-20mg&#039;s of 2-CB with no issues though, might be because it is clear-headed at those doses.<br /><br />I understand full and well that most common psychedelics are harmless, but when that body load kicks in, it&#039;s hard to convince myself otherwise.

				Loss of control, loss of identity, irreversible psychological changes, unwanted spiritual events, unwanted feelings and emotions.<br /><br />In terms of physical damage, MDMA is actually more dangerous. I&#039;m not saying MDMA cannot be taken without harm, but kandi kids and whatnot who take it without preparation can theoretically endure brain damage if they overdo it.

				fear of the unknown maybe? also, they may fear the power of their own minds. my girlfriend is comfortable taking mushrooms and other psychedelics, but is hesitant when it comes to lsd because she is not in full control of her own mind. that lack of control makes it difficult for her to be comfortable in the &quot;driver&#039;s seat.&quot;

				Ignorance would definitely be my guess. Personally, I never knew anyone IRL who had even tried it so there was definitely a stigma incorporated with it. That, combined with knowing absolutely nothing about it besides hearing only the bad stories, made it an undesirable drug to many people I know. SR is actually what has opened my eyes to the safety and recreational joy of LSD. Just my 2 cents! :)

				Propaganda and ignorance. The government benefits from people not doing psychedelics because the realizations people have during a trip undermine the idea of materialism (The driving force of capitalism).

				Cuz it&#039;s acid man, that shit will put holes in your brain, get stored in your spine, and make you legally insane. I know because it happened to my cousin&#039;s friend&#039;s brother&#039;s girlfriend.<br /><br />Edit: I probably should note that this is sarcasm just in case that isn&#039;t clear enough.
