				Title: <strong>HYIP Site</strong><br />

				Hello,<br /><br />So me and a friend of mine were looking for methods to make some cash.<br /><br />We started browsing HYIP Sites.<br /><br />Wikipedia explanation for HYIP: A high-yield investment program (HYIP) is a type of Ponzi scheme, an investment scam that promises unsustainably high return on investment by paying previous investors with the money invested by new investors.<br /><br />We read stories of the ones who got scammed while they tried to make money off of HYIP sites. So we said fuck it, why don&#039;t we open our OWN HYIP SITE?<br /><br />Okay, so we hired someone to make us a good looking template and a fully automatic script that works with LR and PM perfectly.<br /><br />We will open this site, and close it in like 45-60 days.<br /><br />We have bought a hosting and a domain with LR. The guy who works for us arranged a SSL certificate for our site as well. It is showing up as a green https:// right now.<br /><br />Before starting something like this, we need to reconsider the plan. We both using double VPN&#039;s, with 2048 bit encryption. The VPN passes thru two countries, Syria and Egypt. We also use Socks5 every time we want to connect.<br /><br />We paid for the domain and the hosting with LR. We don&#039;t have any personal/private info on the internet. The computers we are using are clean. <br /><br />We got good plans and a nice looking site that would trick people. We have also made a Facebook page and bought 2200 likes.<br /><br />The site was indexed by Google like a week ago, now it appears as the fourth site.<br /><br />The question is, can we make good cash that would be worth the risk?<br /><br />I read the letter of the owner of a HYIP site, and I would like to share it with you:<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Dear Invex Ltd. Players, <br /><br />This is a long message and will be the last news you will hear from us… until we open our next HYIP. We want, kindly, recommend you stop losing your time by looking after us. Anyway, for the cyber detectives, here is how we worked. <br /><br />1 - The basis is having 100% false ID documents. For $200 you get a really nice looking pack of documents, even nicer than legal ones <br /><br />2- We rented a nice apartment with fast internet in a nice city near the sea, with false documents. We then bought a new desktop computer and a new laptop, installed some fresh programs. <br /><br />3- We opened a bank account with false documents, put some cash on the account, and got a nice true debit card. <br /><br />4- We opened e-gold accounts and funded them from the bank account above. <br /><br />5- A bit later we opened e-bullion accounts, funded by… you, idiots who “invested” <br /><br />OK? Now we have e-gold, internet, a place to sleep, eat etc, all without possibility to track us. A major question was “Must we open a real company”. We decided that NO, as people are so stupid that they believe all what they read. And you know what? It is true Invex Ltd. and Lomax Group Corp. are pure fantasy <br /><br />Okay, let’s go to work now! <br /><br />1 - Opening a domain name and booking a server at the katzglobal scammers’ best place, paying with e-gold. <br /><br />2- Later, booking a dedicated server and paying with… the debit card coming from the bank account above <br /><br />3- Renting Prolexic, and paying them by bank transfers from…. an e-gold exchanger The gold came from YOU idiots who “invested” ! <br /><br />To specialists who want to track us by the IP addresses, we kindly recommend you to use Google and look at JAP, Freenet, I2P, TORR, etc. You will understand that our IP come from anywhere in the world, beeing chained between servers who cannot track them. And even if so, the last IP address, the place where we lived, was this nice appartment near the sea, that we left some weeks ago Oh, the computers were given to a charity, after the hard disks were physically deleted <br /><br />Other pros say “Let’s track the money”! Great idea, but don’t forget that even the ******* muslim terrorists cannot be tracked by the special services <br /><br />How did we withdraw all your nice donations? That’s easy, thanks to mygcard who supplied us hundreds of anonymous debit cards that our friedns and us used in various countries! Alain Vignard from mygcard received $20.000 cash in hands for helping us to find the ATM with no “$800/day limits”, and telling us how to use the cards at the best. Well, Alain tried to scam us later, but that is another story <br /><br />We also used bank transfers from the best exchangers, who have no problem at all sending $100,000 or $200,000 every 3 days to bank accounts in Panama, the BVI, etc Nice offshore places outside the EU and the US Track the money there, dear friends! <br /><br />Oh, about exchangers, we worked with one of them from Australia, and where a bit afraid at the beginning, as he wrote on his website that he “verifies ALL data” from his clients. LOL ! His fee is 2%, we kindly offered him 2% more “to preserve our privacy” Look at our dialogue by email: <br /><br />- HIM: 2% more is a good offer, but is your gold clean? We don’t want to work with scammers. <br />- US: Of course, what are you thinking? We are honest businessmen and just want to keep a low profile. <br />- HIM: OK, i can see you are not scammers, just send me the gold and 4% fee instead of the regular 2%. <br /><br />Thank you mister G. )) <br /><br />As I am in a very good mood, I will also explain you something: Most of the biggest HYIP are run by us, a professional team. And when other scammers try to enter our market, BING! If they are interesting people we try to buy them, if not DDOS attacks make them shutdown To be sure our rating is the best one, we also pay the admins of a few monitoring programs, including the biggest and “most reliable” (LOOOOL) one! <br /><br />Our business is to make money. We use 20% of the money we get to help poor and disabled people around each of us, 20% other is given to some “political” associations that fight against ISLAM (Hey guys from the Emirates, Bahrein, Kuwait, etc etc, did you read this? THANK YOU , and the balance is for us. <br /><br />We have currently a dozen of HYIP running, are going to close some of them, and of course to open new ones! We are working like this since a few years, and all is working fine! <br /><br />But you know, it IS possible to make profit from HYIP: Just do it QUICKLY! Look: teamaaronshara@bellsouth.net made $6,580 profit with us, including the commissions they got by sending YOU IDIOTS, to Invex. These people are really scumbags: They are making profit by making you lose! <br /><br />As a clever guy told in some forum, “there were no guarantees, so no need to cry”. YEP! We NEVER gave any guarantee to ANYBODY (unless Titanium plans, and you should notice that THESE guys do NOT cry on your forum, try to guess why…!), we even recommended those who ask for guarantees to go to their local bank They didn’t? THEIR CHOICE! <br /><br />When reading your forum and others, we really laugh! So, most of you were already scammed by other HYIP? By our HYIP maybe Anyway, it seems that you don’t understand what a teenager is able to understand! So, you continue to “invest” here and there, and that is good… FOR US! For you, I am not sure When I see a GREAT SPECIALIST, the “Andrewunknown”, proudly saying that he lost $40,000 into Invex but that he will recover from other HYIP, WE ARE LAUGHING, FALLING FROM OUR CHAIRS )))) Moreover in his list of “no ponzi”, LOL, some of them are from us ))))<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />As you can see, this guy is talking about big numbers. Could this be true?<br /><br />I am sure that most of you know about this type of sites, so yeah, please leave your comments below.
