				I&#039;m in the middle of a transaction with a seller of 110+ feedback. It&#039;s his &quot;policy&quot; that people with under 150usd purchases must finalize early. I sent him a message asking for a tracking number(so i would know if he shipped it - i&#039;d finalize right there if i had that sort of assurance). He responded saying that he only supplies tracking numbers if theres a problem.<br />&nbsp;Am I right in assuming hes not giving a tracking number because he doesnt have one yet? That hes covering his back by getting me to finalize before he ships ?<br /><br />Also, say I finalize early and it never comes / he screws me over (its a 130usd sale). Would I be able to change my feedback score even though I already left one? Or would he be immune from any sort of negative feedback?<br /><br />I look forward to your responses guys :)

				Personally if he has very good feedback I would Finalize Early if that&#039;s what he wants - as there&#039;s a good chance it wont actually be &#039;in transit&#039; until you do.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a new user then you have to offer the vender some trust too - it works both ways. I&#039;m newish (probably 10 buys) but I very rarely have to Finalize early any more.<br /><br />So basically if you&#039;ve read his feedback and he seems legit just go for it and finalize early :)

				Yeah, when you&#039;re a new buyers, without enough purchases, they can and do, require that you finalize early.&nbsp; You can either just put FE, new buyer in the feedback area, or just leave it blank, and yes, later you can go to &#039;Accounts&#039; and see the &#039;View Feedback&#039; and you are allowed to edit it.&nbsp; The only real help you can give yourself, is to study up in these forums, what is said about the vendor.&nbsp; Blow off the flamers and idiots, and see what other buyers say about the vendor...in *recent* threads too.&nbsp; Some of the worst scammers on here had extensive, wonderful, glowing praise all over the place on here...until they ripped everybody off.&nbsp; See &#039;Italian Pilot&#039; or &#039;Tony76&#039; or...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />Tracking numbers, ah, they&#039;re more for the vendor, IMO, to protect him from false claims by by sleazy vendors.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like them, but that&#039;s just me...mostly u just got to give it a little time, think of something else ha ha....<br /><br />But yeah, it&#039;s in transit, should be here soon, then u go back and edit the feedback, mention if shipping took to long, and how quality was, if it&#039;s not pharmaceutical, and don&#039;t describe shipping methods that might reveal too much about vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just part of the process.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve been here a while, you can stay in escrow.

				I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s sketchy - it&#039;s just a process of building trust. I have never had a problem by Finalizing early.<br /><br />Once your stats build up vendors will trust you and then you just Finalize when you receive the product.

				I am in the exact same position, just with less cash. As a new buyer I had to finalize early. To minimize your risk for the first few buys, use someone with the highest/one of the highest ratings. Good to see how I can update me feedback later as well.

				Yep, find theads specific either to your vendor, or to the drug you are interested in.&nbsp; Heroin, for example.&nbsp; I follow the main heroin thread, and I also follow the threads of individual vendors of heroin&nbsp; YOu can also send vendors a PM (private message) or ask a friendly sounding other member of the thread who they think is best and most reliable.&nbsp; Most of us are fairly friendly, especially to new members just wanting a bit of advice.
