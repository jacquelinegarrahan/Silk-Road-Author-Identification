				One thing I&#039;ve noticed is that acid-heads, shroom loons, and other psychedelicists are a bunch of pretentious, lazy hippies who think they&#039;re attained enlightenment because they discovered that they don&#039;t exist...&nbsp; Well I&#039;ve got news for you. You can&#039;t attain enlightenment the easy way.&nbsp; It takes discipline. You have to work hard for it, and if you&#039;re worthy, you MAY be granted enlightenment before you die. It&#039;s called Grace. Not everyone gets it and not everyone even deserves it...It takes hard work and discipline to find God, not personal revelation. The whole idea of the &quot;inner light&quot; is spiritualist garbage which originated in Quakerism.<br /><br />My impression of psychedelic users is they don&#039;t know shit. They annoy the hell out of me. I almost wish that silkroad only sold non-psychedelic drugs because we&#039;ve attracted so many liberal hippies on this forum.<br /><br />Psychedelic drugs have no productive value whatosever.<br /><br />As much as I like other drugs that, unlike psychedelics, actually have productive value or social utility, I really believe that people should say no to psychedelics. Look at Tim Leary, that burnt-out brain fried freak always uttering wishy-washy inanities as &quot;we&#039;re all one&quot;, blah blah blah. Psychedelic users don&#039;t seem &quot;all there&quot; to me when I look into their eyes. And then there&#039;s that effete lisping creep Terence Mckenna who think he &quot;sees&quot; machine elves. A pitiful man led astray by the hallucinations produced by his own bemushroomed brain. May he rot in hell.<br /><br />no-nno-nn-n-n-nooo.! i said NO! read with me morons, i said fucking NO!!!!!!!!! t-t-t-t-take it take it! TAKE IT! Tale take your shrooms and your acid and shove it. take it away now now now now. ENOUGH ENOUGH to make it stop????? to make it stop!<br />really now. NOw is the time. DO IT<br />munch munch munch munch on your psychedelic drugs, but they really munch on your eternal Self. Try not to will yourself out of existence.<br />Take it time, bitch. Take it time.<br />Don&#039;t believe me, two years ahead will do. And it won&#039;t be you.<br /><br />A lot of these fools who do acid and shrooms even believe they&#039;re God. Or that everything is God. lol..... Get real, smoke smoe crack, do real drugs, not these hallucinatory garbage drugs for glue-sniffing losers<br /><br />And yes i&#039;ve tried acid. It tells you the lie that &quot;you&quot; don&#039;t exist. If there is a devil thats what he would tell you...That you dont exist.<br /><br />I do exist. I am not God. And if any drug told me that lie again I would kill myself because there&#039;s no point in living of you&#039;re the only reality and you don&#039;t even exist. Life isn&#039;t an illusion. My mom and dad aren&#039;t illusions. All of this world is real. LSD and mushrooms tell me lies. Don&#039;t believe the lies and save your soul!

				I respect your opinions and wish you well in life but I myself respectfully disagree. I have done a few psychedelics in my life time (mostly weed and shrooms) and have not had any of the experiences you have described I felt the world was more real than usual and that because of that I needed to respect everything (my parents,the trees and insects,and other peoples beliefs) a lot more. To me psychedelic are have really just been a tool to see more clearly what should have already been common knowlege to begain with but was lost or some how forgotten. Peace and prosperity I wish you well :)

				This one gave me a good laugh :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t agree with all the attitude - but can surely understand why hes saying this ...<br /><br />Used to love psychedelics years ago, was a total crazy Acid head for the Hoffman, microdots, gelatine stars and liquid of the 90&#039;s, all there&#039;s need to know about psychedelics is to take them in the right perspective - no high expectation for enlightenment, no big disappointments like the OP apparently had :)

				LOL, I don&#039;t do psychadelics but to each their own.&nbsp; I only get annoyed when people get all Judgey McJudgerson....kinda like OP. <br /><br />At first I thought it was a joke, and thought it was funny.&nbsp; You know, like in a &quot;Oh that is kinda true some people do get annoyingly philosophic about everything while tripping&quot; way.&nbsp; But no, he was being serious.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not cool.&nbsp; I am much more annoyed and disturbed by people when they are high on Meth.&nbsp; I have seen a few people on Meth at the grocery store.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was&nbsp; screamed at for not noticing that one psycho tweaker had &quot;reserved&quot; the checkout lane with a bag of grapes while she went to go get the rest of her groceries.

				sounds to me like you took a trip down the rabbit hole and didn&#039;t like what you found. unfortunately, psychedelics have a tendency to show us what we need to see, which may not always be what we want to see. they are powerful tools and should be treated as such.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. They are Beautiful<br /><br />Truth is beautiful. Psychedelics cause hallucinations. Hallucinations are the opposite of truth. Therefore, psychedelics are not beautiful..(Okami-----&gt;)..............Hallucinations are truth just not the truth your used to seeing its all a matter of perspective. and Psychedelics cause hallucinations yes but all the things you see are from your own psyche so they are truth that is just harder to see and grasp.<br /><br />Quote from: Okamiyasha on Today at 02:38 AM<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. They make you happy <br /><br />No it doesn&#039;t. And even if it did it is a delusion of happiness, not real happiness, which only comes about through hard work and having a job, which the vast majority of psychedelic users will never have in their miserable lives.(Okami-----&gt;) I have a job i work for verizon&nbsp; so fuck you =].&nbsp; it is a delusion of happiness yeah right any happiness you feel is real period.<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. They give you Respect for other Life!<br /><br />Yes, they turn you into an effete liberal hippie who practices &quot;vegetarianism&quot;, believes in &quot;global warming&quot;, &quot;we&#039;re all one&quot; blah blah blah. (Okami-----&gt; ) why are you even on here? sound like a cop just saying<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. They have Great names like Lucy(unlike uppers that meth here in the usa is called shit and the best downers are called junk not very appealing )<br /><br />That is just part of the deception that psychedelicists use to entice you to their drug of choice. (Okami-----&gt;) im glad there my drug of choice sorry you dont know what your missing....<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Psychedelics are great all by myself or with a group of well minded friends. <br /><br />Thats another reason why psychedelic users are idiots. They keep taking a drug that they can take alone. A drug that has no social utility whatsoever. All psychedelics do is make you act like an idiot when you take them in public around thousands of people, as I have done several times by myself.(Okami-----&gt;) being alone and being able to pick your brain is such a wonderful thing on drugs or not. do some self exploring .<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Bad Trips are just Life Lessons. same with Good Trips its just all and experience that we are meant to enjoy&nbsp; and reflect on.<br /><br />Bad trips mean that an underlying mental illness is being triggered into activity by the drug, and may persist even after the drug&#039;s effects have worn off.(Okami----&gt;)<br />&nbsp;if you can not handle yourself you should not take it simple i always know what im getting myself in for i do my research and do not hurt myself.<br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. I can be tripping out of my mind and don&#039;t look as stupid as the people on uppers and downers. <br /><br />Thats because you&#039;re a hallucinating idiot and can&#039;t look at yourself objectively while you&#039;re high.(Okami-----&gt;) i video tape like all my trips so i can look back and see how i was so i know your wrong just saying....<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Psychedelics Have DMT in that class of drug and that my friends is a you know there is not even words for it.<br /><br />Fuh fuh fuh fuh.(Okami_____---&gt;) thats right you can say anything because you do not know and can not even grasp how wonderful that is.<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 9. THC is Psychedelic <br /><br />Psychedelic users trying to claim THC as their own is another part of their game of deception. No, THC is a stimulant/depressant, not a psychedelic. It has nothing to do with you people. You people make drugs look bad. I&#039;m a proud drug user and I wish psychedelic users didn&#039;t exist, and I wish that psychedelic drugs themselves remain illegal indefinitely just to make you idiots angry, while all the real drugs are de-criminalised. That would make me laugh my ass off, pointing my finger at you.(Okami----&gt;) you do not know what your talking about....<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 10. Nature is what it is all about.<br /><br />Then go hug a tree and get chainsawed to death by a logger.<br /><br />By the way: a big fuck you to you, too.<br /><br />(I know this thread was a response to my thread in order to antagonize me for no reason.)(Okami----&gt;) i will bro good idea ..... Peace and Love Okamiyasha =] :P

				I like what kitkat said earlier. Each to their own. LSD isn&#039;t for everyone and neither is a lot of things including weed which is one thing That I don&#039;t understand why everybody doesn&#039;t do it in one way or the other.<br /><br />My first ever LSD changed my life and my way of thinking for the better. I was 24 years old. Some friends of mine turned me on to a hit and a place to trip with great music and the setting and the mind-set was great from everyone there. Those two elements have a lot to do with keeping you on a good trip and as I matured I learned how to control my thoughts and with that I can never have a bad trip. With any kind of bad thought it is easy to remember to just relax and rest in the arms of the universe. Have faith in your God. Really their is never no reason for fear if you have faith.<br /><br />Each LSD trip is usually different so my advice is to try another dose, maybe a less strong dose. Ultimately it is your decision. There are some drugs I have tried and did not like til I tried again. Lucy is awesome and I am glad that i will not die with out knowing that experience. Just put on some music you like to change the trip all together

				The worst thing about the psychedelic community is the hours they spend moaning about Government misrepresentation of cannabis or psychedelics, despite the fact that they will be the first ones to spout off Government propaganda about drugs they don&#039;t use, or practices they don&#039;t follow. <br /><br />In my experience the cannabis and psychedelic communities are nearly as hypocritical as the &quot;Man&quot; they claim to hate so much. Kind of strange for a community that preaches tolerance and peace with such wild-eyed passion<br /><br />Just sayin&#039;....

				This is just my personal opinion but...<br /><br />I think that when used at the right times, psychedelic drugs are some of the most powerful, beautiful, healing and potentially enlightening experiences anyone can have. However, the states of mind produced by these drugs *can* be misleading. I have seen many people chase the psychedelic high because at first it facilitates higher order contemplation and understanding but then later on, these repeat users are unable to do those things on their own without the drugs. <br /><br />Psychedelic drugs have made a major impact on my life, both in the positive and negative. I have no regrets from using them though. Some of the insights I had during my experiences I still am understanding deeper to this day (several years after my last trip, by choice). They are not for everyone, and I am very much against their casual use. Though I took them at raves or concerts, the most productive trips were the ones taken in the privacy of my own home alone or with a friend. Psychedelics have an addictive side on their own. Not an addiction to euphoria or &quot;feeling good&quot; per se, but there is a draw to &quot;figure out&quot; what the experience is all about. And the answer is that the experience will probably never be fully understood on the individual level. <br /><br />(In my opinion) These substances are best used once or twice a year *at most* as tools to facilitate a deeper spiritual understanding of the paths that we walk in this great journey of life.<br /><br />Wishing everyone the best holidays.
