				ITV 2 +1 G! RED TEAM GO GO GO!!!! <br /><br />Hahahaha my favourite one is where he tells people off for selling drugs where he says &quot;STANDING ON STREET CORNERS SELLING DRUGS&quot; and I always think &quot;Fuck standing on street corners, sit on sofas!&quot;...then I have a line. :P

				I would have a line but got to go the shops.<br /><br />Jeremy Kyle is funny when he rants about the &#039;selling drugs on a corner&#039; shit. Most kids who sell drugs tend to sit on a sofa watching Jeremy and answering the phone because the average young dealer does not care about security and will send texts such as &#039;need a few oz of green&#039; or &#039;any coke?&#039; <br /><br />Back to Jeremy, some guy had a one night stand (usually a lie down) and wants the DNA test.<br /><br />Here he comes!!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Sparks joint<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Hey Lim, have you watched any of the Jeremy Kyle USA version?<br />Its fucking hilarious.&nbsp; They may as well have called it Jeremy Kyle versus the american people.&nbsp; Most of the time the americans are so busy mouthing off he has to remind them its HIS show.<br />As for the british version, some of my polish co-workers (yeah i know) cannot believe the kind of people that go on the show.
