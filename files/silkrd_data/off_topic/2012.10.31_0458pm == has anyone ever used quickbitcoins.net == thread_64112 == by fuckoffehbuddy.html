				I just did a bank transfer to CaptainMal at my local bank. Easy and quick! With Bitinstant being hosed at the moment, I thought it was a great alternative.

				I gotta give props to CaptainMal. Like fuckoffehbuddy I used to use bitinstant but since it went down; at least for bank deposit-&gt;bitcoin address I had to find a new method of getting coin. CaptainMal came through and quickly (about an hr on the weekend) but beforehand what stood out was a 100% feedback and a good forum presence, especially loaning small amounts to a number of people. Buying bitcoins can be quite shady and I thought I would provide some feedback on the forums for a relatively new vendor. Although i&#039;ve been on SR for almost a year, providing this review convinced me to create a forum account because I didn&#039;t feel I had much to add beforehand. I realize this is quite off topic but there is no CaptainMal review thread.

				I can vouch for quickbitcoins.net too, I&#039;m really happy with them.<br /><br />I buy my coins via Western Union online, and they send my BTC directly to my SR account in under 4 hours. I used to do cash deposits at banks via Bitinstant, that&#039;s gone now<br /><br />If you&#039;re willing to use CC, I would recommend paying with CC via Western Union online instead of buying directly with credit card. Less fees, and you don&#039;t have to go to their lengthy security check process.
