				How many of you out there are actually preparing for this &quot;event&quot;?<br />How do you think we will all go down?&nbsp; I have seen 2012, and until i saw that Danny Glover was in it, i thought it was a pretty good movie&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />What are your thoughts ??<br />Share, share!&nbsp; It might not be long before we get another chance to!

				Hey Adasel I think that the 2012 thing with the Mayan calendar and all is another gimmick just like Y2K was. I am thinking that if the Mayan calendar is authentic then maybe we may be going from the time of Pisces into the time of Aquarius see. It&#039;s just the end of an era if anything at all so don&#039;t worry and rest easy in the arms of the dragon. All is well

				while i don&#039;t buy into any of this end of the world mayan prophecy stuff, i definitely feel that there is a shift of the collective consciousness happening. on the 21st i&#039;ll be celebrating with my girlfriend (plus mdma and dmt) to usher in this time of change. we can only guess what the future holds, but here&#039;s an idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8v8mgwuubU :)

				I&#039;m just hoping my most recent orders get here for the 21st - if it happens I&#039;m going out in style, high as a mothferfucker.<br /><br />On a serious note though - its the end of the Mayan long count - a more accurate calendar than our existing one in terms of planetary and stellar movements.&nbsp; The age of aquarious just means the axis of the earth is now, and for the next 2600 years, pointing in the direction of aquarious the water bearer.&nbsp; If you wanna read some sort of supernatural deluge into this by all means, scare yourself shitless and start building an ark.<br /><br />Or do what I&#039;m doing...got the day off work, gonna watch half the world panic on the news while smoking some excellent weed and drinking a few whiskeys.&nbsp; Then maybe head out and do some Xmas shopping, cos you don&#039;t wanna take the chance of rattling all your cash before the 21st if we&#039;re all headed out in a bang.<br /><br />Or maybe a big sign will appear in the sky that just says &#039;Level 2&#039; - and everyone has to figure out how to move on from that.

				So whats the exact time the worlds ending?&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking at midnight im hitting the streets in search of a riot or at least to drink beers and mess with strangers.&nbsp; I don&#039;t buy into this shit at all and even read they found another calender that says we got more time, either way who gives a fuck, but I know some people will want to go mental for it or at least I hope so

				Some bullshit news report is giving and exact apocalyptic time of 11:11am on 21.12.12.&nbsp; Soooooo.... is this GMT? or the Mayan equivalent of 11:11am? - let&#039;s even go for mid-morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;Given the Mayans a Central American civilisation I reckon the only place that should be exercising the requisite amount of apocalyptic paranoia is Mexico/Guatamala/Nicaragua and the surrounding area(s).&nbsp; Maybe one of the ziggurats at Chichinitza or Teotihuacan will just take off or wreck the fucking joint.<br /><br />Level 2&#039;s still on the cards though, til at least 22.12.12.<br /><br />...unless someone forgot to carry the 1 when they were working this out.

				End of the world my ass, the Mayan&#039;s just couldn&#039;t be arsed after going 2000 years or whatever ahead. I think they did well for that, I&#039;d have wanted a fag break after 10 years.
