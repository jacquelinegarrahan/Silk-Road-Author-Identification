				I don&#039;t know about others, but this asking for &quot;1 or 2 btc&quot; is getting tiresome (especially now that that&nbsp; one btc is over $10). would you ask a stranger for $15-20 so you can get high? if you are only a dollar or two short, maybe i&#039;ll help you out, but asking for $20? really?<br /><br />

				agreed air. it&#039;s not that&nbsp; your asking for a dollar or whats its really like 20 its more that you dont have any rep or forum posts matey. I was going to help a fellow roady the other day because ive seen them around but it turned out he was joking.&nbsp; &nbsp;So what im tryng to say is get knkwn around here before begging
