				I have been tell from some guy on one other forum about some test address for Satoshi Dice who are pay out most of times due to small amounts of bets to these address. I have copy paste infos below:<br /><br />Notice how many addresses they have?&nbsp; If you know how to count, you&#039;ll notice 27.<br />There are actually 30 Satoshi Dice addresses, three are used to test profitability and<br />percentages.&nbsp; Payouts are actually determined on how many bets are placed per<br />address.&nbsp; If 0% of the&nbsp; bets are placed on a specific address, the win ratio of that<br />address is 100%.&nbsp; If 99.99% of the&nbsp; bets are placed on a specific address, the win ratio is .0045% (rounded) and at best .0099%.&nbsp; Of course the most common payout you could possibly get from Satoshi Dice is 1.004x your initial bet! Then comes the multiplier.&nbsp; The multiplier is pre-set, but not in stone. If you check their site again, you&#039;ll see some of the multipliers are approximate<br />and change over time.&nbsp; The other 3 accounts that have 0% bets on them (that will change after this publication) will pay out 100% of the time and multiply that bet&nbsp; by their pre programmed multiplier.<br /><br />0% means 0%.&nbsp; That means no one has ever bet on the address, so they will win 100% of the time.<br />Factor in the&nbsp; multiplier and you can quintuple your bitcoins with one bet, but then it goes down to 50%, then 25%, then 14.5%, etc..&nbsp; Get in while the getting is good, strike while the iron is hot.<br />My group uses these to get 100% returns, and ditches them off when the returns are below 99.9%<br />We make mad coin and pass the lower percentages off to you guys.<br />If you look at satoshi dice&#039;s website, they keep going with it until 98.1%, such greedy motherfuckers right&gt;<br />They say 98.100% but they don&#039;t have that amount of accuracy (scientifically speaking)<br />Personally I think they like that 98.(100%) trickery that works in modern society.&nbsp; Have you ever purchased something that was .99 of something? or 1.99? 199.99? it&#039;s all a scheme and satoshi dice deserves to go down for this.&nbsp; Thats why me and my group are publishing these test accounts ever week.&nbsp; Each week Satoshi dice needs to make new addresses so people don&#039;t complain about their losses.&nbsp; Each week they test new percentages versus different payouts.&nbsp; But in order to do that they have to make actual transactions, they need the BTC in the account with payments in and payments out so no one cries foul. Get FULL BTC RETURNS:<br />&nbsp;<br />1Dice86XH4QHNaYoUYnzdjq2LScm7k2KHt : Min: 1 Max: 1000 Multiplier: 1.004<br />1DicegjwQDEtbfXcXFZbmoScp9Q64TFoKa&nbsp; &nbsp;: Min: 5 Max: 500 Multiplier: 1.905<br />1DicezyPx16GqPNZ9f86KKqNXXrW2ML7i6 : Min: 10 Max: 250 Multiplier 2.993<br />
