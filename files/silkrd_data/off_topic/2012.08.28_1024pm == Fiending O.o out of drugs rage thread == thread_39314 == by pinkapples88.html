				I feel like a fucking crack head! I am going crazy :/ I ordered from the vendor that Ive ordered most of my weed from and its taking a lot longer than expected.Its not his fault he explained the whole situation to me this isn&#039;t another thread to bash vendors and its not a begging thread.Now back to the topic I have neverrr wanted to light a spliff so bad in my fucking life! I was patient like the first 5 days and had a good amount of self control but now I&#039;m fiending like a crack whore (no I&#039;m not fiending bad enough to suck dick for weed).Its 3 full days til my checks here then knowing my luck an additional day to get all coins situated because I&#039;m using a new website because virwox sucks camel dick.Then an additional 2-7 days for the weed to arrive from the vendor I&#039;m ordering from this time.On top of that on about day 3 or 4 of my weed being in transit I FE just because I figured if its been in transit this long its probably really on its way it might not have been and I might have got burned who knows.I attempted to contact the vendor because he said Tuesday but it didn&#039;t arrive today so I asked if its coming soon and it was read but ignored.None of thats really a big deal I trust the guy and I know he will deliver and even if he doesn&#039;t that&#039;s my fault for the FE.This is just a rage thread.I&#039;m thinking about spending 75% of my check on an assortment of drugs and a shitload of weed and indulging in the delicacy of the gods (shrooms,weed,DMT,lsd) to make up for putting my mind through the torments of not being in an altered state.For now I think I will settle with a blowjob and nut in my fiancees mouth to help ease the edge.If there is a single God/Entity he is cruel.Why couldnt you have just made the post office ship faster.And to the U.S. government learn how to run a business you fucking bastards you monopolize the post office and half offices in every city and town throughout the country then you run the business half assed.FUCK YOU.Just for this I am switching all of my bank accounts to online paperless same with insurance and all that.Time is money and you wasted my time.No wonder people all switched to paperless its because you suck honey badgers cocks!! suck a Labrador retrievers poody hole! To all female post office workers youre all cunts and to all male workers you are homosexuals/gay/faggots..(Assuming those are still the most offensive things to call males and females in the U.S.)&nbsp; Ok rage over.This lesson has taught me that I should hurry with my grow and that I need to order massive quantities from now on and stop using all of my drugs at one time..Instead buy lots more and then use them all in multiple smoke sessions instead.Ok rage is really over this time.I just hate being out of drugs.And dont say I dont have self control 5 days for me compared to some peoples 8 hours isn&#039;t that bad.Deuces.
