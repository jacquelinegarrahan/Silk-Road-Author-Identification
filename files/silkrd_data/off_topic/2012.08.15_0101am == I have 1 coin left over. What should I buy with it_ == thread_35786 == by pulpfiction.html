				So I have one coin left over, wondering what I should buy. I&#039;m not sure if I should go for the Ferrari or the house on the beach.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />So what are some suggestions of things that cost a coin or less (after shipping) that I should look into?

				You could buy that design you&#039;ve always wanted from some chick on the internet like you&#039;ve always dreamed ;) *cough*<br /><br />But seriously folks, my minor investments (lol) on SR quickly get spent on digital items... it&#039;s fun to see what you can get for under 1BTC there.<br />Just today I got<br />Friends S1-10<br />The Muppets S1-5<br />and a handful of awesome coupons<br />ALL for under $40<br /><br /><br />
