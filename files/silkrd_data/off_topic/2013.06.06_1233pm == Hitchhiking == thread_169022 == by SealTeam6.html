				Hitchhiking&#039;s entirely possible. Sometimes it&#039;s even fun, most of the time it&#039;s shit.

				I&#039;ve done it once. Some friends and I had no problem hitching rides from our campsite to the Furthur show, but then came the difficulty of hitching a ride back. In the acid-headed madness and frenzied ocean of tie dye, it was tough to find anybody in the headspace to take us back. We even considered ditching the very small quantity of drugs on us and asking some cops for a ride, but figured we are very far from home (Canada) and did not want to get near an all-American dose of police shakedown. We went to a gas station and started looking for cab companies in the phonebook- fat chance, these were the boonies and it was 1 in the morning. A very sweet girl (an angel, really) noticed our puppydog longing for direction and very kindly offered us a ride part way to the site. Her two friends were out back with another car, meaning we could split up and ride comfortably. She ended up driving us the whole way there, refused any compensation and insisted on an exchange of emails. Our friends in the car behind us had a very different ride- a lot more raucous and inebriated, and they even managed to swing a quarter of bud stuffed in a cigarette box. <br /><br />I hope not to ever be in a position where hitching is a necessity again, because the sunken feeling of failure can be truly dreadful. But there are rewards beyond mere rides when the universe unfolds in just the right way.
