				Haven&#039;t been on silkroad for months due to family troubles, missed you all ;D<br />Wanted to make an order this week and I usually go to vlad1m1r, but everyone&#039;s been saying he scammed everyone. Is this really true? I had used him for btc for a long time, for about £600 total, and have never had any problems with him in the past, and he seemed like a great guy, with great feedback. Does anyone know the story with him? Is it possible that he got busted/had to leave?<br /><br />I know this was a while ago but I have been gone for months. Also, is there any trusted services similar to vlad&#039;s that i could use? If not looks like I&#039;m going to try a bank transfer in the morning :/<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Locker.

				At some point he just disappeared from the forum. No farewell message or anything. I don&#039;t know what happened to the people who had outstanding orders.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never used his services, but if I understood correctly, he had some kind of BitCoin for cash in the mail service. Maybe the address/PO box he used compromised his identity and got him busted. It&#039;s hard to receive mail and stay anonymous.

				Probably the most likely tbh, I still have his address written down somewhere, and this wasn&#039;t a Po Box either, I just sent the cash to his/a friends house :/<br /><br />Locker.<br /><br />Edit: Damn, he really was a great guy :/<br /><br />

				I was never a customer of his, I&nbsp; have spoken with him a few times and I have read the threads about him though. Apparently his customers didn&#039;t get the BTC he owed them (He ran a Cash - BTC service). He deleted his account suddenly... So then a thread was made asking where he was. Because he owed money to A LOT of people. Somebody searched his username on Google, found his Youtube account, images of him, his real name AND ADDRESS.<br /><br />I read in the thread that someone has ripped HIM off, therefore he took the money to make up the amount he lost (we assume anyway).<br /><br />He seemed like a decent guy... But decent guys can make mistakes, or they can turn out to be assholes... either way, we&#039;ve lost vlad. And this has lead to fellow SR members being out of pocket...

				I used him too - before the first time I sent him cash, I read the forum, checked his feedback and chatted with him in PMs.&nbsp; I was still wary, but felt it relatively low risk given his presence and track record, so sent cash.&nbsp; Right at the point he scarpered with everyone&#039;s money.&nbsp; It&#039;s my belief he got caught up in the Pirateat40 ponzi scam and decided to cut and run at that point.<br /><br />He used the same nick on various clearnet sites, and it seemed he had SR users address their cash using his real name.&nbsp; It was even possible to find his Linkedin profile and at least one SR user called his work trying to track him down.<br /><br />Personally, I was able to withstand my loss, so chalked that one up to experience.<br /><br />However, he was also doing an investment / cash-out service for vendors, so there may be people who were scammed for alot more money that they couldn&#039;t afford to lose.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be at all surprised if the outcome of his scam has made life VERY uncomfortable for him given his address was well-known in the SR community.<br />

				Here&#039;s what happened to him, at least most recently - he came back and ran a scam, or so he says.&nbsp; He was prof Moriarty (and himself, and a thug, three actors in the play that we&#039;re aware of) and claims he got some folks to send BTC&#039;s in exchange for information about vlad/Nate&#039;s current whereabouts.<br /><br />I suspect he might be behind another current scam that&#039;s being perpetrated on vendors, no evidence except for writing style, but here&#039;s the last missive from our boy:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=100280.msg703009#msg703009<br />

				just trying to summarize what I have surmised to have taken place with this guy.<br /><br />I am new to SR and as I sifted through threads on security vlad1m1r came across as an incredibly intelligent guy who was well-versed in security. In one thread he mentioned his idea to become a personal BTC transfer service; many critiqued the obvious flaws and necessary degree of trust in making a purchase from him. So, he went on to complete some successful transactions, then disappeared with a significant amount of money. Only to come back using aliases that advertised to find personal info for vlad1m1r. People proceeded to give him money and he returned with bogus info from bogus YouTube accounts etc... Can y&#039;all verify that this was the case?&nbsp; I mean, that was a pretty ingenious scheme, though to purchase BTC&#039;s from someone on SR seems incredibly risky. He really made an effort to plant a good rep for himself; his responses to any questions on the threads were always helpful. Just kinda blows my mind.

				I deleted my posts in that thread because everyone was crying that I was shitting on their parade.<br /><br />When something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Rocker may be that 1% exception, and I hope that&#039;s the case, but I&#039;m highly suspicious of a $5000 drug giveaway, especially when each person wins more than a personal amount.
