				I read about these jokers that buy 2.5-3g on the streets of Camden for £25 or so, working out at between £29-£35 per 1/8th. What is the going rate though in your area? I haven&#039;t bought from a local dealer for a long time but I&#039;m guessing £30 is about average these days.

				The deals on wheels services in my city charge 20 quid for 2 grams, quality is highly variable but sometimes surprisingly good. The worst of them sells damp 1.7s for 20 and was aggressive when we made him come round and refund us.&nbsp; ???

				Good lord. Almost makes me want to put a wholesale order in on SR and start distributing real weights! I haven&#039;t seen a real 1/8th on the street for years and years but that really is taking the piss.

				Generally about £10/gram here (Brighton). Thai stick 1.7g / £10. I bet it&#039;s the same stuff as hashuk&#039;s.

				NO way, Camden is filled with crackheads and junkies, the only thing your going to be buying on the streets of Camden for 2.5g-3g @ £25 is ground up twigs, leaves, cardboard, clingfilm, bin liner, soapbar, folded up paper anything but weed.<br /><br />Nobody on the street really does proper &quot;1/8&#039;s&quot; any more, since 2007 or so...you need to have a decent contact/buying from a mate or buying from a grower.<br /><br />&quot;average&quot; street price e.g going to your local run-down council estate and ask-a-chav-caked-head-to-toe in Lonsdale gear&nbsp; = £20 @ 1.4g <br />&quot;real&quot; dealer price £20 @ 1.6g (could be slightly damp)<br />&quot;good&quot; dealer price £10/g (normally dry)<br /><br />All the weed I sell has been cured and dried to perfection, all the fan leaves are trimmed and any visible stems are cut off or I strip the bud off the stems and I sell that at 1.7g @ £20 with free delivery 24/7, or 3.5g @ 35.<br /><br />I have never ever seen a dealer (not even online) that goes into the amount of hassle I do in making sure the bag appeal is 10/10, but I like to outdo everyone else to make sure I get repeat business. <br /><br />I have about 100 regular customers and 35 &quot;on/off&quot; customers, I&#039;ve only ever had 3 disappointed customers...<br />

				Lol I was in London for vacation this summer and went to camden to score bud. No luck. I asked the dude holding a sign with a mohawk and studs (generally punk look/dead kenndys) and asked him where to score cannabis and the guy told me to piss off. <br /><br />WHY??? Camden is a cool place, but fuck those guys. All the shops selling paraphanalia are run by old indian/arab guys that are motherfucking HYPOCRITES. Oh, and FUCK chavs. I wish they could trade places with the jews in the holocaust. Those fuckheads deserve to die a slow and painful death.

				I&#039;m usually getting 1.6&#039;s of nice dry cheese/amnesia for 20 pounds, although i am friends with my local guy. TBH there is so much cheese around the UK, i&#039;m getting a bit sick of it, its 90% of what i smoke.&nbsp; After reading onestopshop&#039;s post just now though i might have a new regular supplier, prices like that for weed manicured that nice is good, real good. I&#039;m gonna pm you on the road.<br /><br />Its a shame its so expensive, and its painful watching the price of draw in america being quite low comparitively, quality wise/ variety wise anyway. I suppose when the UK finally gives in and decriminalizes/regulates/medicates ganga its always gonna be the same.<br /><br />We can dream right?..... Right?

				£20 an 1/8th used to be the standard price when I was buying &quot;off the street&quot; (not actually off the street but from regular dealers). It ranged from sprayed shit to dank nugs depending on what was available (what they could flip for the most money). <br />I used to know a hash bar in Whitechapel that sold 5gs of nice hash for £20 also.
