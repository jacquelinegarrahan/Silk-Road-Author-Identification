				I just am tired of the drama thats constantly happening and too many idiots and scammers and trolls here, it used to be a lot more of a community but that was way back when. I will only be stopping for acid every now and then from albionessentialols for personal use but its just a stress seeing all this negativity around here. For those who actually are good people in the community and you all know who you are if I have talked to you or not but I love you all and everything you guys stand for. Thanks DPR, thanks Nomad, thanks Limetless, and thanks to anyone else who helps out with this beautiful act against the drug war. I love this all! I will pop in every now and then to see how everyone is doing and to see if some grams of crystal LSD are listed unless I find a private vendor for that. Thanks again to you all! Just wanted to say bye :) It was great knowing everybody and was an awesome run :)<br /><br />Some of my best and last regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				I gotta stay here for a few more days though, I got some orders to finalize when they arrive ;D If anybody knows of some more family like private forums, please don&#039;t hesitate to send em my way, I am gonna miss the online scene :/ Or if anybody wants to contact me shoot me a message with your email and PGP key or your Pidgin OTR Email, I&#039;d love to hear from some people every now and then :) Thanks for the support you guys, you&#039;re making me wanna stay! I wish everyone could be so supportive on this scene. Thanks all again :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

You are some of the greatest people on this site. Thanks so much again :) I never would have thought I would be here knowing I made such an impact on the community.

				I am a newbie, but would also be interested in a community that is more focused on reviews, tips, pointing out new news, helping each other with issues,etc. instead of just calling everyone LEO and all of the other negativity around. I am not saying this place is that bad, just rough on a new guy&#039;s nerves is all.

Now it seems you disagree with the wrong person you get a fuck you. Plus its just getting too big and I know people IRL who found out about this place and do not treat it with the proper care and are really not safe about it. I know of a vendor on here who showed his vendor page publically to a stranger he had known for less than 60 seconds! It really worries me! I wanna be somewhere that gets the respect it deserves and people take the necessary precautions :P Best Of luck Trainwrecked!! been nice getting to know you a little bit :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				As one of the longer serving SR users, I can definitely agree with the view that SR has become less intimate and friendly. However, the lost of the close community spirit should be balanced with the benefits of greater competition and variety of products. I just hope it doesn&#039;t become too big - such that it invites greater scrutiny from the authorities. In fact, I think it&#039;s big enough and should now become a members only community with any new members joining by invitation only.<br /><br />True, there are more scammers than before, but of the 30-odd transactions I have made, only 3 have not arrived and for 1 of those I received a 50% refund. That&#039;s around a 10%failure rate.
