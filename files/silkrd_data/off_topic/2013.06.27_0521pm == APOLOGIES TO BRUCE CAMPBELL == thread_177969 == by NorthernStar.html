				May I be so bold as to say I&#039;m terribly sorry for the inmature way I dealt with some criticism from a seasoned vendor, I can say he has an unimpeachable record, and my utter nonsense should have no bearing on the grand scheme of things, Not that his reputation was ever in doubt. I&#039;m also sorry if I offended anyone else with my crass and disgusting compositions. Consider me ashamed and ostracised and an anti social individual. Once again my profound apologies to Mr C<br /><br />

				to northernstar: really though dude I&#039;d wager most people dont CARE how you feel or what you say about the user BruceCampbell (though about the actor you should watch it :p ) because your entitled. you just don&#039;t have to say so repetatively in so many different ways in so many places or in other words so very DAMNED LOUD.&nbsp; appologies are pointless and weak. just DO better (or , getting only very breifly into philosophy BE better if you can manage but DO better if you cannot) . ::)

				Uh, wow.&nbsp; Were you put up to this or something...?&nbsp; Well regardless, that&#039;s an admirable apology -- and such things are far from pointless.&nbsp; Worth much less than actions, but definitely not pointless.

It needed to be said.&nbsp; I&#039;ve abandoned the rarefied pure&nbsp; air of my idealized forest, and traveled all the way down the polluted town, that is I&#039;ve reformed I&#039;m rehabilitated and I&#039;ve reintegrated myself into a decent and proactive member of SR I&#039;ve embraced conformity, fundamental changes have been made. I&#039;ve ingratiated my self to Bruce. I hope he reciprocates.<br /><br />Thanks to HeartFireFlame...and Tedrux for the&nbsp; kind words, and of course the admirable and always charming SS. The road would not be the same without you!<br />
