				Wiley Series in Psychology, Policing, and Law<br /><br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br /><br />Gisli Gudjonsson is a Professor of Forensic Psychology at the Institute of<br />Psychiatry, King’s College, London, and Head of the Forensic Psychology<br />Services at the Maudsley Hospital. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological<br />Society and an Honorary Fellow of the Icelandic Psychological Society. In<br />2001 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Medicine from the University<br />of Iceland in recognition for his research in the field of forensic psychiatry and<br />psychology. Gisli has published extensively in the areas of psychological vul-<br />nerability, false confession and police interviewing. He pioneered the empirical<br />measurement of suggestibility and provided expert evaluation in a number<br />of high profile cases, including those of the Guildford Four, the Birmingham<br />Six, the Tottenham Three, the Cardiff Three, Jill Dando murder case, Kenneth<br />Erskine (the ‘Stockwell strangler’), Derek Bentley, the UDR Four and ‘IRA<br />funeral murders’ cases (both in Northern Ireland), Henry Lee Lucas and John<br />Wille (USA), and the Birgitte Tengs and Orderud cases (Norway). He acts as a<br />consultant on cases both for prosecution and defence.<br />Gisli is the author of The Psychology of Interrogations, Confessions and Testi-<br />mony (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992), The Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scales Manual<br />(Psychology Press, 1997), Forensic Psychology: A Guide to Practice (Routledge,<br />1998, jointly written with Lionel Haward), and The Causes and Cures of<br />Criminality (Plenum Press, 1989, jointly written with Hans Eysenck). He is<br />the co-editor-in-chief of Personality and Individual Differences.<br /><br />Preface<br /><br />The Psychology of Interrogations, Confessions and Testimony was published in<br />1992 and has been reprinted on several occasions. It was extensively reviewed<br />in the legal, psychological, psychiatric, and medical literature. Its publication<br />brought the issue of false confessions from a scientific perspective to the atten-<br />tion of the legal, psychological and psychiatric professions. It provided a much-<br />needed comprehensive and authoritative text for practitioners, researchers and<br />academics. The book had a major impact in Britain and abroad, which can be<br />seen from numerous legal judgments.<br />Reviewers’ comments on the original book provided invaluable information<br />about how the book might be improved and I have taken this seriously into<br />consideration when writing the current book. Ronald Fisher, in Contemporary<br />Psychology, pointed out that my attempt at completeness on occasions led me<br />to describe cases and introduce material that was not central to the main focus<br />of the book. Some other reviewers expressed similar views and suggested that<br />I focus more exclusively on disputed confessions, and provide a more extensive<br />analysis of how expert opinion in this area has affected the judicial process.<br />This is what I have attempted to do in the current book. In addition, since the<br />publication of the original book, the number of cases of disputed confessions<br />that I have assessed has more than doubled and I have testified in well over<br />100 criminal cases where confession evidence was disputed, including many<br />high profile murder cases in the appellant courts in Britain and abroad. All the<br />important cases are reviewed in this book and the psychological contribution<br />and legal implications discussed.<br />There has been increasing recognition in recent years that false confessions<br />occur and no legal system should ignore the risk of false confession. In order to<br />prevent future miscarriages of justice, complacency, lack of open-mindedness,<br />ignorance, unwillingness to accept mistakes and judicial cover-up must be re-<br />placed by a more positive approach to a problem that will not go away unless<br />we actively confront it. There are various steps that can be taken to reduce the<br />risk of false confessions and prevent miscarriages of justice. These steps, in-<br />cluding judicial, educational and psychological means, are equally applicable<br />to legal systems of Britain, USA, Australia and on the continent of Europe.<br />When I planned this book it was originally commissioned by Wiley as a second<br />edition of my previous book. As I began to write however, it became evident that<br />the field had expanded dramatically and this development has continued as the<br />xviii<br />Preface<br />book has developed. As a result, it is largely a new book rather than a second edi-<br />tion of the previous one. Some themes have had to be omitted from the current<br />book to accommodate new material. This includes some of the basic principles<br />and theory of interviewing, child witnesses, psychological techniques for en-<br />hancing memory retrieval and evaluating testimony and documents. There are<br />now other books available that make these chapters unnecessary and these will<br />be indicated in the text, as appropriate.<br />Accompanying new and important court case material, and important legal<br />changes since the original book, there has been considerably more research into<br />police interrogation tactics, psychological vulnerabilities and false confessions.<br />All the material that remains from the original book has been re-written and<br />up-dated to accommodate these new findings. The current book is larger and<br />more substantial than the original and the focus more international.<br /><br />GISLI H. GUDJONSSON<br /><br />

				Introduction<br /><br />On a Saturday morning in the early part of 1987 a 17-year-old youth was<br />arrested and taken to a police station for questioning. A few hours later he<br />had confessed in great detail as to how he had sexually molested and then<br />murdered two elderly women before leaving their house. The following day the<br />youth confessed again to the murders, in the presence of a solicitor. In spite of<br />the lack of forensic evidence to link the youth to the murders, the case against<br />the youth was potentially strong because (a) eye witnesses who knew the youth<br />by sight had placed him near the scene and (b) during interrogation the youth<br />had apparently given the police detailed and specific information about the<br />crime, which the police believed could only have been known by the murderer.<br />On the strength of the available evidence the youth’s case was referred to the<br />Crown Court, during which time he was remanded in custody. The case had all<br />the hallmarks of a successful crime detection, which would result in a conviction<br />for two murders and sexual molestation.<br /><br />Whilst on remand in prison the youth consistently told his solicitor and<br />his family that he was innocent of the crimes he had been charged with. He<br />claimed that his self-incriminating confession was due to persuasive police<br />questioning. Matters had been made worse for the youth by the fact that during<br />early detention in prison he had confessed to the murders to prison officers and<br />to a fellow inmate. The youth clearly had been interviewed quite extensively<br />and persuasively by the police officers, but he was a young man of reasonable<br />education and without any obvious mental illness or handicap. On the face of it,<br />the youth had confessed due to skilful interrogation carried out by experienced<br />police officers who had reason to believe that he had committed the crimes. The<br />murder enquiry was thus successfully conducted except for one important fact.<br />The youth was innocent of the crimes with which he had been charged. While<br />the youth was in prison on remand, the real murderer committed another very<br />serious offence before being apprehended.<br /><br />This brief case history, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9,<br />is one of many that are used in this book to illustrate some of the processes<br />and mechanisms involved in producing erroneous testimony, including a false<br />confession.<br /><br />The terms ‘interview’ and ‘interrogation’, as applied to the police investiga-<br />tive process, imply some form of questioning, whether of a witness to a crime,<br /><br />2<br /><br />A Psychology of Interrogations and Confessions<br />a victim, a complainant or a suspect. Both are essentially a way of gathering<br />information for use in further enquiries and perhaps judicial purposes. The<br />term interrogation is more commonly used in the literature, and in police prac-<br />tice, to refer to the questioning of criminal suspects, whereas witnesses and<br />victims are ‘interviewed’ (Rabon, 1992). Such a distinction is, however, quite an<br />arbitrary one, and the term ‘investigative interviewing’ has been proposed to<br />cover both the interviewing of witnesses and suspects in England. This term<br />has now been incorporated into police training and its evaluation (Clarke &amp;<br />Milne, 2001; Williamson, 1994).<br /><br />The purpose of the book is to examine in detail the various aspects of inves-<br />tigative interviewing and to highlight the factors that influence the accuracy<br />and completeness of the information collected. The emphasis is on the appli-<br />cation of psychological knowledge and principles to investigative interviewing<br />and confessions. The major issue addressed is to what extent psychological<br />knowledge and principles can assist the police, psychologists, social workers,<br />probation officers and the legal profession, in the gathering and evaluation of<br />confession evidence.<br /><br />The book shows that during the past 20 years or so there have been major<br />advances in psychological theory, research relevant to interrogations and con-<br />fessions, the law pertaining to investigative interviewing and the admissibility<br />of confession evidence, police training and the contribution of expert psycho-<br />logical and psychiatric testimony to criminal court proceedings. My previous<br />book, The Psychology of Interrogations, Confessions, and Testimony (Gudjonsson,<br />1992a), provided a detailed discussion of scientific advances, and their impli-<br />cations, up to 1992. Since then, further psychological and legal developments<br />have taken place and these are comprehensively discussed in this book. As<br />far as children’s testimony is concerned, which was discussed at some length<br />in my previous book, the recently edited book by Westcott, Davies and Bull<br />(2002) gives a comprehensive coverage of the recent developments in the<br />area.<br /><br />In view of the extensive amount of material presented in this book, which<br />comprises 23 individual chapters, it is separated into four main parts. In Part I,<br />entitled ‘Interrogations and Confessions’, the theoretical, research and practical<br />aspects of interrogation and confessions are reviewed. There are nine chapters<br />in this section of the book. The first four focus on interrogation, its contexts<br />and the tactics used by the police in the USA and Britain. Empirical research<br />findings are presented into interrogation tactics and the psychological vulnera-<br />bility of detainees. Two chapters enquire into the reasons why suspects confess<br />to crimes they have committed. Both theoretical perspectives and empirical<br />evidence are presented. This part of the book concludes with three chapters<br />where the focus is on miscarriages of justice and false confessions. Relevant<br />research and theoretical aspects of false confessions are discussed and case<br />examples are presented of different types of false confession.<br /><br />One of the chapters in Part I, ‘The identification and measurement of<br />“oppressive” police interviewing tactics in Britain’, is co-authored with Dr John<br />Pearse, a senior police officer at New Scotland Yard, with whom I have worked<br />jointly on cases and conducted extensive research over the past 10 years.<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />3<br /><br />Part II, ‘Legal and Psychological Aspects’, consists of six chapters. It com-<br />mences with a detailed discussion of the English and American confession law.<br />Differences and similarities between the two legal systems and legal practice<br />are highlighted. The chapter on the American law is co-authored with a New<br />York attorney, Lorca Morello. After discussing the legal issues and practice<br />there is a chapter on psychological assessment. The concepts of interrogative<br />suggestibility, compliance and acquiescence, which have become increasingly<br />important legally in the context of disputed confessions, are discussed in detail<br />within the context of the relevant theoretical and empirical evidence. Part II<br />concludes with a chapter on the effects of drugs and alcohol on the reliability<br />of testimony. In this chapter a double murder case of the false confession of a<br />heroin addict is presented.<br /><br />In Part III, ‘British Court of Appeal Cases’, the role of the Court of Appeal is<br />discussed and 22 leading disputed confession cases in England and Northern<br />Ireland are presented and the judgments evaluated. In all but one of the cases<br />the convictions were quashed, often on the basis of fresh psychological or psychi-<br />atric testimony. In the one unsuccessful case, the House of Lords later quashed<br />the appellant’s conviction and criticized the Court of Appeal’s decision to uphold<br />the conviction. The cases demonstrate how the Court of Appeal views confes-<br />sion evidence and expert testimony and how its approach to such cases has<br />developed over the past 12 years. I have carefully traced this development and<br />will show how high court judges have become more sophisticated in the way in<br />which they admit and rely on expert psychological and psychiatric testimony,<br />particularly as it relates to psychological vulnerability. The legal criteria for<br />admitting psychological evidence have broadened considerably. The courts are<br />no longer restricted to admitting evidence where there is mental illness or learn-<br />ing disability. Personality disorder is now judged as a potential psychological<br />vulnerability relevant to the reliability of confession evidence. Furthermore,<br />personality traits, such as suggestibility, compliance and trait anxiety, when<br />falling outside the normal range, are now regularly admitted into evidence to<br />challenge the admissibility and the weight of confession evidence. The impact of<br />psychological research and expert testimony on legal changes, police practice<br />and legal judgments is a development unparalleled in the rest of the world<br />(Gudjonsson, 2001).<br /><br />The cases of the ‘Guildford Four’ and the ‘Birmingham Six’ were the first<br />to have a great impact on the English legal system. They brought the risk of<br />false confession to the attention of the legal establishment and the public. The<br />chapter on these two cases was prepared jointly with my psychiatrist colleague,<br />Dr James MacKeith. We were both commissioned as experts to work on the cases<br />prior to their successful appeal. We review these cases and present some of our<br />medical and psychological findings.<br /><br />Part IV, ‘Foreign Cases of Disputed Confessions’, provides a detailed discus-<br />sion of seven high profile cases from outside Britain. The cases demonstrate<br />how different legal systems—American, Canadian, Israeli and Norwegian—<br />approach, view and evaluate disputed confession evidence and expert testi-<br />mony. As will be seen from reading these chapters, there is much to be learned<br />from cases in different jurisdictions. The dangers of coercive interrogation<br />4<br />A Psychology of Interrogations and Confessions<br />techniques, the risk of false confession and miscarriages of justice are of in-<br />ternational importance and all judicial systems must take these seriously.<br />In the final chapter of the book, ‘Conclusions’, I draw together the main<br />findings from the other chapters and provide a conceptual framework for future<br />work on investigative interviewing and confessions.<br /><br />This book is aimed primarily at practitioners involved with different aspects<br />of investigative interviewing. This includes clinical psychologists and psychia-<br />trists who have been asked by legal advocates to assist with the evaluation of the<br />likely validity of self-incriminating statements, such as confessions. Detailed<br />assessment techniques will be provided for this purpose, including the assess-<br />ment of specific and idiosyncratic psychological states and traits. The relevant<br />legal concepts, legal practice, Court of Appeal judgments and detailed case pre-<br />sentations, will be provided to assist expert witnesses in how to assess a wide<br />range of cases of disputed confessions.<br /><br />Police officers will find many parts of the book directly applicable to their<br />investigative work. The book is not a training manual for police officers on how<br />to interview, but it does provide police officers with a further understanding<br />of the processes involved in producing erroneous and misleading testimony.<br />In addition, it identifies the circumstances under which information can be<br />collected most effectively. At a policy level, the book has major implications for<br />police training.<br /><br />Social workers and probation officers will find several of the chapters useful<br />as they commonly have to interview and assess groups of individuals who need<br />special care, such as persons with learning disabilities, the mentally ill, children<br />and the sexually abused. The increased role of social workers as ‘appropriate<br />adults’ during custodial interrogation in England and the criticism they have<br />received in the past about their interviewing techniques of allegedly sexually<br />abused children mean that this book is going to be particularly helpful for them.<br />The legal profession will learn from the book what kinds of contribution<br />clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can offer to judicial proceedings. Case<br />histories will be used to illustrate specific points throughout the book and these<br />provide an important insight into how the judicial system deals with the prob-<br />lems created by disputed confessions. Many of the findings highlighted in the<br />book provide an important insight into safeguards against false confession.<br />Finally, the combination of theoretical ideas, empirical findings, case histo-<br />ries and leading Court of Appeal judgments brings together knowledge that<br />will also appeal to researchers and other academics. Hopefully, it will stimu-<br />late more research, both theoretical and practical, in an exciting field that is<br />already rapidly expanding.
