				I don&#039;t understand how anyone could be so monumentally stupid. I know she&#039;s just a kid but she&#039;s been in the public eye a while, she should know better by now. <br /><br />

				Exactly, in the Dorcester hotel as well which probably have camera&#039;s anywhere and everywhere. <br />Annoyingly, she&#039;ll get away with it purely because she has enough money to pay for extremely good lawyers.
