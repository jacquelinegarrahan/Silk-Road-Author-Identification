				Never been addicted, have tried numerous types of drugs but I&#039;ve always managed to quit or take a break whenever I felt being on the verge of addiction. Don&#039;t feel like trying highly addictive drugs like Meth or Crack. About the latter drugs, it&#039;s not only about fear of addiction but because of the brain damage they do. Not only from the aspect of memory and reasoning but also from the emotional point of view, which is the most important imo.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t feel like not being able to feel real joy or positive emotions for the rest of my life. <br /><br />Everything in moderation.

				I dont even want to try the highly addictive drugs because as chil said its not really worth it. I however have been smoking MJ pretty regularly but i dont mind it cos i only do it before bedtime and it helps me sleep. Apart from that i have tried LSD, DMT and mescaline but never felt that i was addicted to them.

				I think as long as you stay away from opiates and cocaine you should be OK. The other drugs can be psychologically addictive, but not physical.

				Cocaine and heroin (or perhaps I should say, opiates in general) are the only drugs that scare me.&nbsp; I have slammed both.<br /><br />I have seen both drugs screw up friends.<br /><br />Heroin bores the hell out of me, and has never been an issue.&nbsp; Its a great drug if you like staring at your foot.<br /><br />Cocaine, on the other hand, scares the fuck out of me.&nbsp; Even when just snortin&#039;, I want to go buy more when the stash goes empty.<br /><br />I keep my distance from Lady C, but still can&#039;t help myself whenever a line is put in front of my nose.<br /><br />- Bit

				I was heading towards meth addiction. I suddenly had a source that was cheap, convenient and screaming high quality.<br />I never ran out. And, I changed. It distorted me. I finally walked away from it and haven&#039;t touched it since.<br />I never will. Think long and hard before you start. Its a fast trip down.

				@BO89 - That&#039;s really really sad to hear mate, good on you for finally doing the right thing! Once the drugs start to run your life that&#039;s when its time to get serious.

				I&#039;m on probation till December i get urine tested yeah as we all know they dont test for LSD, Ket, MDMA and other Research chemicals<br /><br />the reason they only test for Weed, Coke, Heroin, Benzo&#039;s and Amphetamines is because they are linked to committing crime<br /><br />oh and welcome to SR by the way<br /><br />&nbsp;;D
