				http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/05/01/student-abandoned-in-dea-holding-cell-drank-own-urine-to-survive/<br /><br />Basically they arrested a California student because he had ecstasy, marijuana, mushrooms, and some prescriptions pills. So already they&#039;re fucking up this poor kid&#039;s life over a few drugs, but to top it all off they accidentally forget that they locked him up. He was left for five days without food and water, and he was forced to drink his own urine just to survive. He attempted to kill himself with his glasses because he was so desperate.<br /><br />But I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll still get prison for life, while the people that made this happen to him will get a warning and possibly a fine. Welcome to America folks.

				&quot;Surprisingly, Chong allegedly found a bag of methamphetamine in the holding cell, which he used to stay awake.&quot;<br /><br />Seems like that&#039;s a bit too far... I highly doubt there was just a back of Meth chilling in the cell.

				i wonder what the LEOs reading this think. Do they think they deserve to be punished for this kind of shit or do they think they&#039;re exempt? Would love to hear their opions on how this is somehow okay with a throwaway account or something.
