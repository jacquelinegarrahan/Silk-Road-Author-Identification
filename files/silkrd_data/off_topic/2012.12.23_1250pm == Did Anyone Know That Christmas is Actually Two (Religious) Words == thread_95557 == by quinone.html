				The word Christmas is actually Christ Mas.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is, it&#039;s the day of the year where we hold a Mass (a Church proceeding, like going to church on Sunday and singing some shit and then eating the &#039;body&#039; of christ, which is just some mass produced wheat product that i&#039;m sure the company get&#039;s a chuckle out of knowing what they are producing these for) for Jesus Christ.<br /><br />He&#039;s actually not believed to have been born on December 25th (Using the Gregorian Calendar, the current standard civil measure of the passage of &#039;yearly&#039; time.&nbsp; Funny thing about that is that the Gregorian calendar didn&#039;t come into use until 1582 lol).<br /><br />Regardless, there are MANY contentious claims on Jesus Christ&#039;s birth and nobody actually really know&#039;s when (IF) he was born.&nbsp; <br /><br />Christmas is just a day you are actually obligated to go to Church Mass if you are religious to give thanks and all that shit to a fictitious man (sorry i&#039;m Atheist, if you believe in God/Jesus I DO respect you and sorry for stomping on your religion, i&#039;m just bored and felt like being facetious :D).<br /><br />Instead we&#039;re too busy opening our gift&#039;s and that awesome PS3 you&#039;ve been wanting for Christmas :D.<br /><br />I&#039;m just incredibly bored right now so thought i&#039;d share that with everyone, cuz I know you all care !&nbsp; (lol i&#039;m fucked haha, but this is the Off Topic sub forum :P)

				I am not a Christian, but celebrating the birth of Jesus doesn&#039;t bother me at all. I believe that all religions are one, and Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the most singular personalities in the history of the world. I admire Jesus as I admire the Buddha, Krishna, Laozi, Socrates, and other saints and sages.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Regardless, there are MANY contentious claims on Jesus Christ&#039;s birth and nobody actually really know&#039;s when (IF) he was born. <br /><br />Christmas is just a day you are actually obligated to go to Church Mass if you are religious to give thanks and all that shit to a fictitious man</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry, but this is incorrect. There are multiple, early, independent, and non-Christian attestations to the existence of Jesus which has convinced the majority of scholars today that Jesus Christ was a real person.&nbsp; Few people who deny the existence of Jesus are actually trained in ancient history, religion, biblical studies or any cognate field. So extreme and so unconvincing is this claim to 99.99 percent of the real experts that anyone holding this view is as likely to get a teaching job in an established department of religion as a creationist is likely to land in a bona fide department of biology. <br /><br /><br />
