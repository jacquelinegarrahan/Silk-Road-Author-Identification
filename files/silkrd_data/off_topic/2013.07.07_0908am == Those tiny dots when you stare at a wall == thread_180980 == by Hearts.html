				I&#039;m very sure I&#039;m not the only one who experiences this, but when you stare at a wall or something, do you notice those very very very small dots all around your vision, usually they seem like they are white.<br /><br />At times if i stare long enough I see red and green on them, of course its even stronger when I close my eyes. It reminds me of static a little, because it seems like they are moving or are like clouds of smoke of some sort. Even If you stare at the white areas on your screen, do you notice it?<br /><br />I always noticed this, sometimes when I close my eyes I try to manipulate them and make figures and shapes, but It just ends up having a static style appearance anyways, but I still can do it.<br /><br />Sorry If I&#039;m not describing it right but I&#039;m sure other people get this too? could someone explain to me what this is? <br />I doubt its you seeing the cells of particles since its plain impossible to do so with the naked eye. Could it be related to layers of the eye that light gets filtered through that creates the effects? And even more vivid when the eyes are closed, since very very little light is passing through the eyelids, somehow intensifying the view of these microscopic &#039;dots&#039;?<br /><br />It just amazes me, how us humans operate, how we experience things, what we are... A complex machine that lives off energy, same with everything else... Could we have a soul? (I believe yes), why are we here? How can we enhance our mental capacity so that we can do more, to understand more, thus experience more.. Or are we just in the early stages still?<br /><br />Drugs are amazing since it gives us a different perspective of things that we normally view, because of the state we were in, we can bring back those experiences to our sober life to try make meaning of it... oh crap I&#039;m going really off track aren&#039;t I?<br /><br />But Just thinking about those dots lead me to this silly rambling.. Anyways, Can anyone out there who knows what I&#039;m talking about (The white dots we always see) please explain to me what it is?

Its within the darkness<br /><br />Heres some other guy explaining it, Its most probably the exact same thing I see <br /><br />http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread524631/pg1<br /><br />Here&#039;s one theory<br />&quot;My optomotrist told me about this phenomena after I told him about seeing things similar to what people here are describing.<br /><br />The blood vessels are actually in front of the retina. The white blood cells, which are much larger than red ones, cast shadows onto the retina as they go through those blood vessels. You don&#039;t normally see the blood vessels, or the white blood cell&#039;s shadows because they are normally filtered out of your vision.&quot;<br /><br />And another<br /><br />&quot;It sounds like you guys naturally trip a little bit. If adrenaline or dopamine is oxidized twice, it becomes adrenachrome and dopachrome. Both are hallucinogenics. If you produce this in high enough quantities, you&#039;re essentially permafried, ie schizophrenic. It sounds like you aren&#039;t there, but somewhere in between.<br /><br />If it bothers you, and ever gets out of control, look into orthomolecular therapy. Ascorbic acid and niacin will likely prevent hardcore hallucinations by recycling the NT&#039;s and preventing excess adrenaline production.<br /><br />If you enjoy the ride, carry on. &quot;<br /><br /><br />But I doubt its some kind of hallucination, but in the dark, If i try hard enough to look at something and imagine a face to fit the shape or something, those spots can help make that happen, thats why I try not to be scared in the dark, I don&#039;t know if im making sense but i know i&#039;m not the only one who&#039;s experienced this!

				Heres a good erowid read, not long at all and might describe it even better<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=21997<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I&#039;ve been smoking bud for about 3 or 4 years now. Within the last year, I’ve been smoking pretty much daily. I also love to trip. Besides bud, I&#039;ve done mushrooms, acid, DXM, ecstasy, speed, tranqs, pain killers, nitrous, LSA, salvia, and plenty of prescription pills. So it&#039;s safe to say I’m something of a vet with these sort of things. Whenever I smoke pot, however, I get this kind of vision that my friends and I have dubbed &#039;pixel vision&#039;. It&#039;s kind of like what I see when I look extremely close to a television screen, but on everything. Everything has pixels like walls (especially white), ceilings, floors, everything. I love it. When I do other drugs with bud, it magnifies the pixels.<br /><br />Somewhere over a year ago, I began to notice that I didn&#039;t need pot to see these pixels anymore. I can see them on most things even when I’m not stoned. I have permanent pixel vision and I think it&#039;s one of the funnest things ever. It doesn&#039;t distract or harm me in any way, except when I’m bored I can look at a wall or carpet design and it looks like it would when I’m stoned. Smoking pot makes it more prominent, but I’ve noticed that if I&#039;ve smoked pot the night before (which is most of the time), the pixel vision the next day is more prominent than if I hadn&#039;t.<br /><br />Is this because of all of the drugs I’ve taken over the last 4 years? Maybe. I&#039;d mostly attribute this to pot, though. Have I permanently fried my vision? Not necessarily. I still have better eye sight than a lot of my non-drug friends (I can read farther away signs and stuff). But there&#039;s definitely something not normal about my vision.<br /><br />The main reason I’m writing this is because I’ve never come across anyone else with this. Even my drug buddies don&#039;t really know what I’m talkin about. The only reason they understand is because they see it when they&#039;re stoned, but not sober like me. So, if anyone else has this condition, you’re not alone. I say enjoy it!<br /><br />Just be safe and happy trails! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its really interesting because I noticed it more when I smoked up and now its been ages since I have done weed, but I always have seen it when sober, I get hints of purple at times... I feel its a mix of the electromagnetic spectrum and vision, I get mostly blue and red colors with the dots but its not that obvious, I don&#039;t know how to explain it!

				Sorry for so much of the spam but I found out what it is! <br /><br />Visual snow<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow<br /><br />Visual snow is a transitory or persisting visual symptom where people see snow or television-like static in parts or the whole of their visual fields, especially against dark backgrounds. It is much like camera noise in low light conditions.<br /><br /><br />Theres a really good example of what I see in a gif on that wikipedia page, and on this <br />eyeonvision.org/visual-snow.html<br /><br />Its pretty interesting! I know I&#039;ve had this since I was a kid, since it says on wikipedia<br />&quot;Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is another condition which has resulted in the onset of the visual snow following the use of hallucinogenic psychedelic drugs. In HPPD, the symptom of the visual disturbances has been described[2] as aeropsia (literally &quot;seeing the air&quot;).&quot;

				I think they are called phosphenes, of which there may be several types.

				I get it too Hearts.&nbsp; Particularly when I look at the floor - carpets or floorboards.&nbsp; Less whites, but reds, greens, blues, yellows, purples galore.&nbsp; Have taken a lot of psychs over 20+ years and it ain&#039;t done me any harm.&nbsp; You&#039;re right, there are times when it&#039;s stronger then others, and I get it when I&#039;m straight/sober, even bored and just choosing to tune into it.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve still got 20/20 vision.&nbsp; And continue to take psychs.<br /><br />Never really bothered checking out what it was, just suspected it was due to taking plenty of acid.&nbsp; <br /><br />And then there&#039;s the time you tried to describe it too someone who can&#039;t see it and you just sound like you&#039;re tripping irrespective of whether you&#039;ve taken something or not, as you insist the pixels are there...<br /><br />And then you tell them that you can see them on their face and it all gets a bit &#039;Aphids! Aphids!&#039; from A Scanner Darkly<br /><br />Enjoy it.

Well it doesn&#039;t disturb my vision and I do have pretty alright eyesight, like 72-70 ages ago I checked. Haha I just thought every human had it, maybe other people do but just don&#039;t notice it, or don&#039;t have it at all!<br />Oh well were human in the end right? :)

				I always thought it was from me looking at screens too long and then my eyes expecting everything to look like a screen so it tricks me into seeing the world as pixelated. Probably completely wrong but eyes can be funny like that sometimes.
