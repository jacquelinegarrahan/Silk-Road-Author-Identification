				You haven&#039;t tried meth before and you wanna go straight to smoking? You should snort a bump of it first to get a feel for it. Then you can try chasing some of it off foil. Thick steel foil works better than thin aluminum foil.

				Tin foil is just fine... it&#039;s really easy.&nbsp; The whole idea is to make a channel that the meth will run down when it melts so that it doesn&#039;t get too hot.&nbsp; So you keep the foil tilted a bit to help with that and just kinda chase the smoke with a straw or something -- except straws tend to melt.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot easier than it sounds.&nbsp; When you get to the end of the foil, flip it around and repeat.&nbsp; Supposedly called &quot;running the highway&quot; and &quot;chasing the white dragon&quot; or some shit, but I&#039;ve never met anybody who actually calls it either of those.

Just don&#039;t open up a CFL lightbulb or you&#039;ll be smoking mercury which is flat out poison.<br />Eating it is the most efficient way to consume it. Wrap a bump up in a little square of printer paper and swallow like a pill.<br />Or snort a line, which burns like hell.<br />I really don&#039;t recommend slamming it with a syringe. SWIM&#039;s personal experience with that was awful and if you&#039;re inexperienced with it, it&#039;s really dangerous. Plus it&#039;s a really different high.

				Thanks for all the constructive advice folks.I think I might chase it to start now Aktion pointed out the mercury in bulbs :S<br />GRDR it doesnt take a man to stick a needle in him/herself as i do it everyday,not saying im not a man though ;)<br />Selfsovereignty,thanks for the advice but before i was pinning I had a few years practice running shit on the foil<br /><br />Its really quite rare here in the UK which is why I dont know much about it.You would think the country would be awash with it but quite the opposite.That rare that I tried making some a few years ago but fkd it up somewhere down the line and now the government has taken the active ingredient out of sudafed so havnt bothered since.need someone to show me how to do it properly and i could make a fkn fortune here!

				It&#039;s only the energy efficient light bulbs (cfl bulbs) that contain mercury. Regular round bulbs are fine.&nbsp; ;D<br />Just remember that you want to smoke vapor and not actual smoke.. and it turns to liquid real fast. Careful not to burn it or it&#039;s a waste. :)<br />Either way good luck and enjoy the ride&nbsp; ;)

I personally didn&#039;t like fucking around with foil.

				I have smoked DMT off of tin foil as well. It works, it liquifys and is a little tricky. The concept is the same as smoking meth though. You are just trying to vaporize it. Get a HealthStone glass slide and that will work for oil, and DMT/Meth in any bong. Just be sure to dump out the water for the Deams or tweak.<br /><br />On a side note I do not condone doing Meth via any ROA.

				I get what your all saying is that the meth turns to a very viscous liquid when heated so will run off the foil easily unlike h which is pretty easy to control.I might just get in the shed and construct something from a lightbulb then.<br /><br />Also from what ive seen,everyone uses a turbo lighter.is it because its a cleaner flame or hotter? the normal lighters leave lots of soot but turbos are no good for foil cos it rips it up.

				Tin foil is poo. I used to make pipes out of lightbulbs all the time, that&#039;s probably your best bet. It may take a few bulbs for you to get a useable one, however... I&#039;ve been thinking about making a video demonstrating how to make a proper one (or at least how I used to make mine) but it might be useless information.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Also, some people may disagree, but I&#039;ve been smoking meth for close to 2 years now and I have always used a normal Bic lighter. I think it would be difficult to keep your pipe completely clean when using it, as you can see mine does get a little black, but it&#039;s best not to touch the flame to the glass to avoid burning your gear and keep the black marks off your pipe. The picture below demonstrates about where I hold my lighter when smoking.<br /><br />http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/05/20/hCLOx.png
