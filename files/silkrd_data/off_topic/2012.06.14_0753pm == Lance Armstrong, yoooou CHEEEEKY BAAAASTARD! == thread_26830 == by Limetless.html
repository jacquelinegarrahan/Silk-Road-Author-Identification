				So looks like everyone&#039;s favourite cyclist is getting done for doping, cheating, trafficking, helping others to cheat, supplying performance enhancing chemicals and generally being a slag with no sense of fair play. <br /><br />Fucking LOL.

				He gets accused every year, find it amazing he&#039;s managed to wiggle out of them all so far since I&#039;m fairly confident given the evidence of all his past allegations that he is a doper, just like the majority of other cyclists. Joey Barton is another one I&#039;ve had my eye on, he&#039;s got textbook roid rage and a haircut that could only be used to distract women from his back acne and deflated testicles.

				You mean juicing?<br /><br />Idk man roids is fair play imo. If you can implement them and not get caught then imo you deserve to win. It&#039;s kind of like cheating. If you can do it without getting caught you&#039;ll go places not just in school but in real life. Deception is a useful fuckin skill and has some pretty damn good benefits.

But yea he has been fighting off these accusations for years, ive no idea whether i think they are true or not, ive never really followed cycling. <br /><br />For the guy asking for a clearnet link just go on the BBC Sports website and click on cycling

				Does anybody really think that all it took for him to win was doping? I don&#039;t believe there is a sport, including high school anything, that isn&#039;t totally overrun by drugs. Way to support a fellow doper!

				This has to be the 50000th time Lance Armstrong has been accused of doping.&nbsp; I mean come on, the guy won the tour 7 times in a row, with drug tests held at each stage. He&#039;s probably had more drug tests done on him than any other cyclist in history, and they all came up clean! I would be really surprised if this &#039;shocking new evidence&#039; gets anywhere close to proving anything.
