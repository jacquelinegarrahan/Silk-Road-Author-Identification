				(Created alias to only ask this question - I am a frequent SR Forum user but wish to ask this under a new nym)<br /><br />Lately things have been getting quite hot with my money-making and I am feeling uneasy about dealing in my area for the time being as my name is getting out too much. With some current charges against me I do not need to deal with getting into anything else or more specifically something that is looking to be unsafe for me. Sure the money is great when I can spend a grand on SR and make it into $2k in a week but an uneasy feeling is telling me to take a break just for a bit.<br /><br />As such, I still have around $5-$6k that that I would like to invest. I wondering if SR has any ideas. I&#039;m fine with any sort of suggestion, be it illegal or legal. <br /><br />Current Ideas - <br /><br />Spend the money to buy necessaries for a MDA synth. I am NOT a chemistry major, but I am intelligent and can figure out nearly anything I truly try to do. If performed I would sell on SR.<br /><br />Take trip to NL and stock up on a large amount of MDMA to bring back to the states. My area is dry for molly and it is what I currently buy/resell from SR.<br /><br />... I&#039;m out. I want something with a high profit of return while accepting high risk or legality (yet not asking for prison through means such as selling offline).<br /><br />Anything helpful is appreciated. Be it crazy or safe. ;)

				Buy gold!<br /><br />$6k is only about 3.5 oz and it is going up. With the way O-Shit is printing money I am betting it will be over $2k an oz by Jan.

				Well, I would say BTC. When I first got on the road 1 BTC was £2.87 now it&#039;s £7.31...double and something BTC will eventually reach 21.000.000 and my guess is that they will explode then.<br /><br />There is also a chance of losing some money, it&#039;s not certain but in my country we say that if you don&#039;t take risks you don&#039;t win.

The world economy runs gold.. not Americas economy<br /><br />anyway... what are you gonna do when china calls in its over ten trillion that the states owe them.. that&#039;s over 65% of Americas total national debt most of which is held by individual investors and corporations. <br /><br />the price of gold rising has to do with the states trying to get out of debt!! PEOPLE WANT TO GET PAID!!!<br /><br />Sadly it has not worked nor will work... buy 2014 I will bet that gold has hit less then 1000 an ounce maybe even less then 900...<br /><br />you don&#039;t have to believe me but I suggest you do...<br /><br />Its a sellers market not a buyers market... Gold that is!!! <br /><br /><br /><br />
