				You know its who I am, if I can help and I am asked I will.<br /><br />Usually its a couple bucks, cause that is all I can afford..<br /><br />One hit me up right after I had gotten a tax refund, and I gave him $20..so what..I dont care what he does with it..<br /><br />It is ironic to me to see someone holding a starbucks cup giving them dirty looks and making some sort of excuse..I mean you paid $5 for coffee for yourself, you wouldnt share that small a kindness with someone down on their luck?<br /><br />I really view it as treat others as you would like to be treated..somehow I hope the karma works out for me when I need it..<br /><br />I live in an area where the homeless hang..they are often at one of the parks I go to, they camp down the street when the cops arent rousting them..I am not at all worried about my safety or anything like that..they are ALWAYS kind and say hey hows it going or whatever..and actually none have asked me for anything when I am taking a walk around my neighborhood..<br /><br />One hit me up one night when I drove to the gas station and I gave him a $20, thats the only one ever to ask by my home..both of the guys I gave $20 to(years apart,towns apart) were very concerned that I realized I handed them that much..it really made me feel good to be able to make them happy..hell I hope they ate dinner, got some smokes and had a beer..<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll give money to homeless people with which I&#039;ve developed familiarity. I prefer to give food. I think giving money to homeless people is not a simple issue of kindness. Many homeless people are homeless by circumstance and need all the help they can get, but more helpful than money to them are tight, supportive, and motivating relationships- something connecting them to the society from which they&#039;re already so alienated. Many others are homeless by choice (or by default given their social philosophies), a choice I respect and will not eagerly donate to. I&#039;ve come close to taking the plunge myself and have good friends who do live this way. The general idea to this way of life is that money is as transient as anything, its transience especially apparent when smokes, drugs and candy are around. Here, your money is of little survival value and not totally necessary. Cut the middle man and share your fun stuff.<br /><br />My point- Food and genuine social contact are more helpful than the passive toss of a coin into the hat of a person that may as well be a signpost that reads &quot;repress your bourgeois guilt&quot;.

				helping someone to the point of dependency is certainly a issue, and very wrong.&nbsp; what about that mom who constantly gives their child money, even though they use it to support their childs dope habit; which certainly isn&#039;t helping that person.&nbsp; In the u.s. especially, i believe more people are homeless than not, by personal defeat.

				Usually I do not have much to give out, but I will at least acknowledge and reply to them. I do not think you are wrong for not giving to them, but so many people in the city just treat them like inhuman pieces of garbage by not even looking at them or responding to them. At least look them in the eye and say &quot;no, sorry but good luck&quot; if you are not going to give anything to them rather than just ignoring their existence. They&#039;re people too.<br /><br />On the other hand, who I FUCKING DESPISE are people with clipboards who try and corner you and get you to &#039;donate to their cause.&#039; They&#039;re almost always such pushy fuckers and act like they have a right to your time; fuck that I would much rather give a 20 to a homeless man that would spend it on a bottle of wine than give it to any of those &#039;for a cause&#039; people that pretend like they give a shit about you. I once stopped to talk to one, and he was talking about how they successfully closed a large coal factory. I then asked him &quot;so what happened to all the workers&#039; job?&quot; He just stuttered and mumbled something about how they were &#039;happy about it.&#039; <br /><br />goddamn assholes

				I give a few coins to anyone who asks for it as long as they look like their need for it is genuine. After my friends ask why and explain it isn&#039;t for the bus that they said it was for or it wasn&#039;t for a hot meal, it&#039;s probably for drugs or cigarettes or whatever. I know this but the way I see it, if someone is genuinely in need of money that badly that they would lower and degrade themselves to literally beg for it, then in my opinion they genuinely deserve it, no matter what the reason.

				Where I live there are a good bit on &#039;homeless&#039; and they hit the same spots all the time. I rarely give to them mostly because I feel like the ones I see &#039;begging&#039; don&#039;t deserve my hard earned money. Most of the true homeless I see going through garbage to look for food or clothes or anything they can get money for. If they asked me, I would probably give them money.

				I only give if they are doing something like music, selling something, offer to help me etc Or if they ask for food also. One day one girl and her daughter were asking for anything from flat to flat. She was really sad, probably she wasn&#039;t accustomed to do it. I took some food, and gave it to her. <br /><br />But there is a woman who is every day in the same fucking place all day, sorry, but.. really ? Do something, don&#039;t just sit down waiting for others to buy your food. I don&#039;t know, there are a lot of things that you can hand made and sell etc I know a person who took a lot of drugs and is crazy.. and does that. He is mentally insane and can, but you, who looks perfectly sane, can&#039;t. Fuck that.<br /><br />Another day there were a couple of really fucked up guys asking for almost no money. I just went to look if I had any money, and my ID card dropped. One of them saw it and gave it to me. Without any kind of shit, or give me anything that I helped you etc I didn&#039;t had any money and I was pretty drunk. I asked to some guys(friends ?) who were with me if they had money, they looked to another side and just waited a few seconds so the homeless left. Then they argued with me about how they looked, and that return my ID was perfectly normal and I had not to feel gratitude for it as It was what any person would do and how junkies etc etc they were. And similar shit. Fucking hypocrites. <br /><br />Well, fuck. If I lose my ID and some guy see it and returns it to me I pay him a drink in gratitude. He is saving me like lot of hassle and some bucks.. Why would I don&#039;t feel gratitude ? I have seen guys who take it, ask you money, or they don&#039;t return it. I saw a fucking medium-high class guy do that, and then is expected anything from anyone ?<br />Some hours later I found them, asking for the same, and the same quantity.. I really think they needed that money for real and no one give anything to them.<br />I felt really sorry for not being able to give them something like.. one dollar ?<br /><br />I simply feel that even if right now I&#039;m totally independent, living alone in my flat, doing a engineering degree, and all in all, with quite a bunch of money considering I&#039;m almost 19.. maybe I will have some problems. Maybe one day I do some shit and I fuck all over my life. <br />I just want to be treated as I treat them. Because I really know and feel that I could be me who is there begging for something to eat, or even if I hadn&#039;t eaten anything and I&#039;m starving, for some drug that I can&#039;t really pass without.<br />

				im always surprised at how indignant ppl get about the simple act of giving.&nbsp; the whole &#039;mine&#039;&nbsp; complex has always seemed indefensible to me.&nbsp; to&nbsp; be that person who can just release any possession; to actually discipline yourself to be able to give up any physical object, to&nbsp; whomever you will, and suffer no pang of regret or hesitation;&nbsp; that is an aspiration that i have always revered. i can think of no freer state of body and soul than to be able to give, without&nbsp; requiring the receiver to&nbsp; conform to some standard.&nbsp; yes, without requiring ANYTHING in return from the receiver.&nbsp; just to find out what any and every person wants, NOT NEEDS, and find out how to give them , or help them to get, whatever it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;in a world where this was the expected duty of each human,&nbsp; towards whomever they encountered,&nbsp; anywhere and everywhere...&nbsp; the entire culture of blame that is crushing the life from this race of humans, wouldnt stand a chance.&nbsp; evil couldnt survive, because when you give with no expectation of outcome, depravity cant survive.&nbsp; if every person was taught to help every other person get whatever they want, and stay true to that,&nbsp; things like fear, hatred, and blame simply could not survive for long. they would always wither and die as ppl felt how it feels to truly have their wants and needs met all the time.&nbsp; there couldnt be any hitlers, because as a child, all of the basic and extended needs would have been met. one after another.&nbsp; there wouldnt have been any angry soldier, any need to be heard, any history of abuse and shame and secrets. in any family or individual, anywhere.&nbsp; &nbsp; just the love, as each person reaped the benefits of nurture from all sides.&nbsp; &nbsp;and on&nbsp; a planet of ppl, who never fend for themselves, greed doesnt exist.&nbsp; wants disappear.&nbsp; &nbsp;replaced with the highest satisfaction there must be, humanity:&nbsp; getting all they have,&nbsp; by only giving.

You hit it on the head sealteam6. no matter the circumstances if the less fortunate of our society are not treated with a scrap of respect then we utterly fail as a society. although you will go broke yourself in NYC if you are giving to every beggar. Give what you can when you can and try to do the best for your fellow man/woman/child. we will all need a little help sometime, believe it or not, the time will come.

				The homeless people where I live only ever buy cigs/alcohol because a little change isn&#039;t going to get them an apartment, so I usually give them any food I have and in a few cases I&#039;ve just offered to take them out to lunch.&nbsp; It&#039;s just about the best thing you can do for them that is affordable for the average person.&nbsp; Many genuine people will thank you a million times while the extreme druggies will not even bother taking the food. It&#039;s good karma either way :P

				I always try to help when I can.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been down and out. I think so many people don&#039;t realize how close they are to being in the streets. Divorce, lost job, depression...snap of a finger it can be you too.<br /><br />I read about a group in Bitcoin Magazine called Sean&#039;s Outpost. (clearnet: seansoutpost.com) They do homeless outreach in Florida and fund the whole thing with Bitcoins. I wonder how many donations they have recieved from guilty roaders like me?

				I give some of my profits to the homeless, It&#039;s a long story but before silk road, I was getting ripped off as a hunter/vendor to keep anonymity. I&#039;m doing so much better with SR I like to give some of the shroom money back to people who need it<br /><br />You could actually say that Silk Road has helped people enough to make their own money for their own work to enable people to give back to people who need it - because middle men are no longer taking all the money
