				Bruce concurs. Bruce always identified with some of the other members, as if they were his own kind; not far removed from himself. He then took a big rip from his bong, exhaled, took that nice bit of fresh air in as if he were savoring something: perhaps his freedom, or the moment; whatever it was, it tasted purple, and it was good.
