				Hey,<br /><br />Thought I&#039;d spark this thread off as I&#039;m sitting in my room and heard directly beneath my room is my kitchen and I&#039;ve just heard some shit move.. it&#039;s probably my cat but it&#039;s still creepy.. hate this kind of stuff, yet I love to talk about it lol.<br /><br />&nbsp;About a year ago I was making a bacon sandwich in the kitchen and have heard a quiet tune on the piano being played (we have a piano in the conservatory which is next to the kitchen).. but there was nobody there and was also alone in the house at this point. This is the only thing I can say I&#039;ve experienced that was very strange and didn&#039;t have any explanation of.. could of been my mind playing tricks on me but who knows..<br /><br />Feel free to share your views on the existence of ghosts / spirits or even experiences of them..

				I spent a summer working in a building where the stereo volume went up and down by itself...sometimes while I was sitting next to the stereo. I never saw the knob move, but on more than one ocassion I turn the volume nearly off and a few minutes later it was LOUD. Used to freak me out. The owners just shrugged and said they were used to it.

				I personally want to believe in ghost and have had some experiences but I have never seen anything. I even like watching ghost adventures cause I&#039;m a nerd like that, ghost hunters can suck a dick. Anyways I was staying at my aunt&#039;s house and I woke up twice, once on separate days at 3 in the am to these horrible crying noises outside my window. The house and neighborhood was already creepy enough and then this happens. My family told me it was cougars but it sounded human mixed with an animal voice, the scariest thing I have ever experienced.<br /><br />The other thing was in the house I&#039;m living in now. For a week straight I would hear a females voice call my name. Sometimes it would be while I&#039;m going to sleep or while I&#039;m watching t.v. It&#039;s been months since anything like that has happened.

				I&#039;ve never had any personal experiences with seeing ghosts, but there were houses I lived in as a child where inexplicable things happened (stereos turning on in the middle of the night, doors opening then slamming, phantom feet running up the stairs at night), but I haven&#039;t really had any of these &quot;encounters&quot; for many years now.&nbsp; Although I will say I have started to believe in another realm of spirits coexisting with us while tripping on 25i-NBOMe or sometimes a high dose of shrooms; there&#039;s that eerie feeling that you&#039;re being watched, and I often see random flashes of light which seem like other presences.&nbsp; But maybe it&#039;s just the drugs.&nbsp; :P

We lost her first dog suddenly -- she went into the vet for a routine examination, and ended up having to be euthanized due to advanced cancer. <br /><br />We went out, and upon returning home, opening the inside porch door, for a split-second, I saw her sitting on the carpet, as big as life. My better half went without a dog for several months. During that time, at night, we would hear a thumping sound coming from the empty dog bed, like the sound a wagging tail would make. This repeated itself several times over the next few months, and stopped only when a new dog entered my partner&#039;s life. <br /><br />Carbon14<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s very odd to be honest, it&#039;s almost as if the guide dog was still looking out for your partner even though it wasn&#039;t physically present but spiritually present until a new dog came along to look out for your partner and only then the dog could leave her which is very touching if true!

				Hello, I&#039;d thought I&#039;d offer my insight into this.<br /><br />When I was young my father would tell me stories of spirits, witches, servents and something else.<br />Of plateaus, of the wait before we moved on.&nbsp; I would have dreams of talking to the dead.&nbsp; I would ask them to slow down because they spoke so fast.&nbsp; They were so heavy too.<br /><br /><br /><br />When I grew up, I grew up, I was taught energy is neither destroyed or created.&nbsp; We are energy.&nbsp; We are changed.&nbsp; We never go away. I can&#039;t prove that things are this way or that beyond death.&nbsp; I can&#039;t prove what I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; I know that there is something unseen.&nbsp; I know, that people don&#039;t disapear. Something happens, but we don&#039;t go away.&nbsp; I know that there are other things out there.&nbsp; Beautiful things and very dark things.&nbsp; In my hallucination, that is reality, I&#039;ve seen them.<br /><br />Reality is what we percieve.&nbsp; For some, silence is unknown.&nbsp; For others, color do not exist. We assume that we our minds percieve is all that there is. I belive that our minds are not capable of expressing to our consiousnes, what is in fact reality.&nbsp; All of us see in black and white.<br /><br /><br />
