				it sounded like pills and when i realized it wasnt addressed to me, i slipped a small piece of paper out a small opening in the package to see the drug info booklet, then was able to use a small LED light to read the prescription bottle. unbelievably i was shocked to see a bottle of 90 freaking clonazepam in my hands. 90 1 mg klonopin!!! dropped into the lap of someone with severe anxiety and a doc who wants to try stupid cognitive-behavioral therapy... stupid insurance im a freaking pharmacologist, give me drugs! lol<br /><br />it was unfortunately addressed to my neighbor and evidently the mailman got confused with all my SR packages and stuck it in my box.. i really wanted to keep it obviously, but the return address was from the veterans hospital and the withdrawal from benzos is hell causing seizures, with the delivery confirmation i didnt know if the old man could get more... so i decided to take it back to em. knocked twice with no answer a couple different days, and said if they didnt answer the next time id keep it, but the old lady unfortunately opened the door today and so i handed that three months of no anxiety over reluctantly.&nbsp; i was feeling dope sick and wanted those fuckers so badly, just taunting me in numbers ive never seen, let alone held, before<br /><br />gratefully the universe rewarded me doing the right thing with my abnormally long awaited package from opi greeting me later today in my box. never been so happy to see a package after worrying about the interception and mail delays... i was jumping for joy. another couple weeks without being sick, more time to ween myself down thankfully.<br /><br />anyone else ever found anything unusual or unexpected awesomeness in their mail boxes?

				That would have been a very nice surprise, but like you said, it was probably more needed by someone else. Especially being an older person, (I&#039;m sure what it&#039;s like where you live), but I would imagine that it wouldn&#039;t just be a matter of not having meds, but also the fact that they would have lost money as well.<br /><br />You did the right thing, and you got rewarded for it as well, even if it wasn&#039;t by the owner :D Not everyone would have done the same thing you did.

				Fair play for giving it back OP. You always get rewarded for being honest even if it&#039;s in a roundabout a long way down the road. It&#039;s all about the karma. :) +1

				haha, thanks for the support. lol it was one of the hardest decisions ive had to make recently :P<br /><br />awesome how everything works out with the cosmos if you just try to do what you think is right and treat others with love <br /><br />no one else ever had anything like that happen though? <br /><br />Also, wrong place but if anyone sees this and happens to know, in the US can i go to a regular doc to possibly get legit anti-anxiety meds or does it have to be a shrink? <br /><br /><br />THANKS. love the community :)
