				you&#039;re short on an order and have to beg the SR community for money.<br /><br />Hi everyone,<br />If you&#039;ve read up to this point, thank you. Now that I have your attention (assuming you&#039;re still reading), I would like to do something that I would never thought I would have to do: Ask the SR community for a favor, specifically in the form of money. Now, I know what you&#039;re thinking, &quot;Sdesu, if you&#039;re short on an order, why don&#039;t you just get less than what you were wanting to buy, and instead purchase the cheaper option.&quot; Excellent suggestion, but there is one problem: I can&#039;t. My method of obtaining bitcoin relies heavily on Sugar Mama (who currently has a waitlist for MoneyPak exchanges) as well as her minimum amount required for an exchange. Second, I am not sure how long this particular listing is going to last - It&#039;s an incredible deal that I don&#039;t want to/can&#039;t/won&#039;t miss out on. This can be made possible with your help. <br /><br />Well, I&#039;m short an unusual amount, $40 (Approx 4ish BTC). <br /><br />Because this amount is more than what most people would ask from someone, I promise to make it worth your gracious effort - I will do this by paying you back double whatever you loan to me.<br /><br />Another question you may be asking is: &quot;How do I know you won&#039;t take my money and never pay me back?&quot; The answer is &quot;You don&#039;t.&quot; However, hopefully my reputation speaks for itself on this forum, for what it&#039;s worth. <br /><br />For those of you willing to help me out, my SR user name is the same as my forum name: sdesu<br /><br />Respectfully,<br />sdesu

				If you snag the listing in my signature and let me see your buyer stats, and I find them to be good and worth the loan, I can get you that loan.
