				If you have drugs to sell but no seller account, I&#039;ll list them for you in exchange for 10% of the profit. In the description I&#039;ll make it clear who the item is from and that I take responsibility for the listing. When someone orders the product, I&#039;ll send you their address through PGP/GPG (keep in mind the buyer will be aware of this). I will only be working with trustworthy people with either a high post count and/or a great buyer reputation. As a seller my reputation is very important, so if your worried I&#039;d keep the profit for myself keep in mind that you&#039;d be able to ruin me if you wanted to. I&#039;ll confirm any deals on here so everyone would know if I tried anything. After payment is received, I&#039;ll send 90% of the profit to your buyer account or bitcoin address.<br /><br />I know some people will be skeptical about this but since this is not against any rules as far as I know, I think people deserve this opportunity. Since the buyers will know what&#039;s going on I think this is completely fair.<br /><br />If SR takes issue with this I&#039;ll remove the post immediately. I&#039;m definite not trying to break any rules here, just trying to make money.

				Im not speaking for SR, but I don&#039;t see why there would be a problem. You, the vendor, has a lot to lose, what if the product is bunk, or the buyer doesnt receive it. its your ass on the&nbsp; line. Not who you are selling for. I&#039;d only do it for people I know or trusted..

				I think there&#039;s a big security vulnerability that isn&#039;t being recognized here. Somebody with a lot of successful buys will have probably sent their address to many vendors, some of whom could have been LE. If you ever mentioned who you were proxy selling for, it could turn into a disaster if LE knew their address. The people you would be selling for would be placing a lot of trust in you to use very secure operations and communication. Just curious here, but moonbear, have you ever bought under your moonbear identity or given an address linkable to you in any way to anyone on the forums? You have to assume you&#039;re compromised if you&#039;ve sent out an address and if people also know you are now a vendor.

That was before SR&#039;s message about altoid being banned and all that, so I wouldn&#039;t do it if I was asked again. <br /><br />I appreciate you watching out for me, I really do.

				OKAY, lets get this straight.&nbsp; you&#039;re in high school (possibly college), studying to be a surgical tech, and you&#039;ve posted that the principal has already called you in for doing drug related searches from school computers.&nbsp; &nbsp;all that an LE agent worth his weight in salt would have to do to catch you is order from you, find out what postal code you shipped from, call around to local schools near your shipping postal code and talk to principals to see which students studying your field have been called into the office for using school computers to make drug related searches.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m not even LE, and i could probably track you down.

				Moonbear, from our short talks on here, I think you&#039;re a decent person, who I wouldn&#039;t want to be in prison. <br />Please listen to Mr.Grey, he is quite intelligent, and helped save me from making mistakes, as well. Don&#039;t take it with the wrong attitude. <br />I can&#039;t lie, and say I am not intrigued. If you listed for me, I don&#039;t see how you could get in trouble. Other than conspiracy, but a conspiracy is just that...no proof. <br />I know $$ has a spell on us, it&#039;s why they invented it! but take your time, research, and do the shitty 4 hours a day on the forums, trying to sift through the shit to find the gold. It&#039;s a long task, no one REALLY wants to help, so you are on your own in learning.

				At first I didn&#039;t mind him on these forums, but now I definitely think he should just leave and go back to browsing clan forums or whatever. <br /><br />Reading these posts proven of how unprofessional he really is. He is not taking simple precautions to avoid any trace that could lead him back to LE, first of all, post count doesn&#039;t matter at all. You state that higher post count makes you look like you aren&#039;t a troll, as a matter of fact it really does. It just proves you sit here and browse posting nonsense to up your post counts to prove to others a form of what you think is &quot;Professionalism&quot;.<br /><br />And browsing these forums at school is just not a good thing. At all.<br /><br />Are you AT LEAST encrypting everything?

I think moonbear comes across as a decent and even honest person. Also in the face of adversity he&#039;s kept his friendly approach, and seems to be appreciating the educational value of events so far. I think he&#039;s got &#039;some&#039; potential here. Despite the mistakes of this youthful ventures, the intent and the entrepreneurship is shining through (with the first proxy service at SR and all).<br /><br />Now moonbear.. people wont be able to trust you with their name and address for a little while after this. Take this opportunity to get serious about your game. Tell people what measures you will be taking to secure all transactions. EG:&nbsp; What measures are you taking to ensure that you are not at risk? How far will you go to protect your clients? Information security, tell us what you know and what your doing....<br /><br />^ This is not an endorsement of any kind, as I probably wont be utilizing your services. But if you are the young and honest person you present yourself to be then I can only try to balance the weight of this thread with some more words of encouragement (I don&#039;t disagree with the posters before me either).<br /><br />Keep in mind, you risk your rep&#039; here; your client&#039;s risk their livelihoods. This premise should be the basis for every step you take in forging your path as a vendor.
