				Well you must be reading this thread wondering what its all about.<br />The last couple weeks i&#039;ve been getting a place ready and a plan in order.<br /><br />Basically i need some startup funds to get a project to take off, about $5000 to be exact.<br />So what will this $5000 get you in return? Good question...<br /><br />I plan to get a new pill press from one of my contacts, about $2500. The other $2500 is for active ingredients, binders, punch sets, pill bottles/labels and other unforeseen expenses.<br />I will take care of production and distribution, and i already have a perfect location cleaned out and setup for production as early as tomorrow.<br />You&#039;re now wondering whats involved on your end... Well besides providing the initial startup funds absolutely nothing.<br /><br />Once project takes off, which would be about 3weeks after providing funds you will be paid 75% of all profits until your initial $5000 is paid back to you in full. <br />Once paid off you will then remain collecting 50% of all profits for another 6 months.<br /><br />Through some extremely conservative calculations i&#039;d expect to have your $5000 back to you in under a month from day of starting production easily.<br /><br />Please contact me if your legit and looking for a reliable business partner to make some cash with. All i require is that we both remain 100% anonymous to each other.

				Does it involve burning down a lab, melting bodies in acid and blowing up a man in a wheelchair?<br /><br />Not to mention the millions I make and then have most of it stolen from me and no way to spend the remainder.??

If you noticed i&#039;ve been a vendor for close to a year. I make a lot more than 5k and wouldn&#039;t be worth it for me to disappear for such a small amount lol. Use your fucking head.<br /><br />Please post questions only in this thread as I will only be answering them from now on.

				Likewise if you&#039;ve been a vendor for a year why don&#039;t you have $5000 to spend on this yourself? Especially if you think the return will make it very worth your time.<br /><br />This suggests you&#039;re either shit with money and likely will burn all the profit you make or that you don&#039;t intend to do anything you said in the OP.

				Well good question... I recently just mortgaged a new house so between expenses, bills and down payment I don&#039;t really have much to play with. I owe $120k and want to pay it back asap. So I figured I&#039;d get my little setup back up and running to supplement that.

				Sorry bro, no one is going to give you 5 stacks. And I&#039;m pretty sure soliciting on the forums for something that is &quot;out of escrow&quot; is against the rules... as a vendor you should know this.

				don&#039;t get too offended, that was just my humorous way of saying i would have some serious concerns in investing in such a manner. the concerns i can think of off the top of my head, and ones that you will certainly need to address in some way if anybody is going to take this seriously are...<br /><br />investing in a drug dealing operation is risky in itself, you could get busted or even killed for example. investing in an anonymous environment increases that risk ten fold, not only do we not know you, but we have no idea how you operate and how you avert risk in your operation. but then there is the tricky matter of you not wanting to give away details to an anonymous person who could potentially be a cop. what solutions do you propose to get over this hurdle?<br /><br />what if silk road was to close down? its hardly the most stable of business models.<br /><br />also if you used sr then the investor would need to finalize to enable you to put the capital to use. once finalized there is no resolution system in place to safeguard the investor. they wouldn&#039;t even be able to give you a bad feedback or score.<br /><br />do you work with other people or alone? is there any other parties that would ever be in a position to rip you off and leave you unable to pay back the investment?<br /><br />what makes you so sure you can generate enough sales to meet the repayment of the investment? <br /><br />i would have loads more concerns to be honest tho, that&#039;s just a few i could think of.<br /><br />i do also want to state that you should be very wary as LE could use this to worm their way into your operation. the reason i state this is so that by simply stating it here, hopefully it will be read by the pigs themselves and they will then realize that you are so then aware of the possibility and will not then bother in the first place. however they still could so do be aware and keep it in mind.

				if you&#039;re a vendor with product why don&#039;t you offer product as collateral against the 5 grand?
