				On the topis of sites being run by feds.. A few years ago there was a site called Shadowcrew, an underground trading forum for fraudsters and the like. They managed to bust one of the guys that ran the site, struck a deal with him and used the site to collect evidence. Ended up with ppl across the world getting arrested and banged up for many years. The safer you can make yourself with encryption and the like the better. So even websites that started off as legit can become insecure, always use encryption for anything that you don&#039;t want the law to be reading.

				At least in Europe LE cannot sell you drugs and arrest you. Legally. Though of course they can buy from you and arrest you.<br /><br />Running a Forum and screening trades between other people on the other hand is legal, and they have done it before. With success.

The problem that i see with SR now is that people talk too much.&nbsp; Get your drugs, get out. Its much safer for everyone that way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is why the other sites are private and invitation only as they do not want or need any exposure. The only chance to be invited is to be friends with somebody who is already on one. When it comes to these sites if you invite someone you are responsible for their actions so if they mess up so did you and you will LOSE your spot on them so people are always very careful about who they invite.<br /><br />And you cannot surf around and find them on any wiki because they are never listed or advertised anywhere for good reason.

				Haha no wonder none has come to me yet.<br /><br />I&#039;d probably commit some noob faux-pas and get myself and the person who invited me booted.<br /><br />Not saying I lack common sense, I just have shitty luck... or wait... maybe that&#039;s the same thing...
