				Firmly seconded riskyrik - I counted over 40 on the first 4 pages of Off Topic section of the forum.&nbsp; C&#039;mon moderators - is there nothing than can be done to stop this cunt or bunch of cunts from cluttering up forum space in some vain attempt to scam a couple of noobs out of a few £, $, EUR or [insert currency here].&nbsp; Plus these fuckers randomly spam everyone&#039;s message account.&nbsp; Anyone with a modicum of common sense is gonna check out the forums and find out they&#039;re a bunch of bullshitting bastards who are just gonna do a runner with any cash you send them.&nbsp; We all know and welcome the anonymity of the genuinely free market SR provides, and welcome new members with something to contribute - trade purchases, feedback (positive and negative) and constructive opinions/discussion.&nbsp; But there&#039;s always some annoying cunt that needs to be told to fuck off.&nbsp; And since the mods are the only ones with the capacity to do something along these lines, MODS GET THESE SCAMMING SPAMMING CUNTS TO FUCK.<br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; &nbsp;

				shroom, evidently they have looked into more ways of automatically preventing it, without much success<br /><br />someone more tech savvy than myself mentioned for some reason even a captcha wont work to stop it. i dont understand. and its not for the admins i do it, its for all the members of the community - stopping trying to remove it will mostly hurt the members more than anything imo <br /><br />unless everyone stopped buying on SR cause of the spam but i dont think even that would happen. it will just stop people leaving reviews and resulting in more scams

				Hey microRNA - if you&#039;re offended at my rant, it&#039;s really not at you, it&#039;s the spam, spam, always the spam - I didn&#039;t realise that there was only yourself and moksha who dealt with spambusting the whole forum, and we do appreciate your efforts.&nbsp; Maybe its cos I was up early/very late that I noticed a shitload more from that btkoin.com cunt than I&#039;d ever seen before.&nbsp; If you need a hand, and more virtual bodies to step up and help out, just ask.&nbsp; &nbsp;

So I help usually as soon as I see it. The Spam Busters idk exactly how many are regularly logged in but moksha and mircoRNA have been doing a superb job. The spammers use to only use 9 post then change username now i&#039;ve seen it rise to 25-32 posts before switching.

				seriously even a simple word filter that replaces links to the scam site with SCAM would do a lot to deter the scammer. I appreciate that mods are deleting the spam, but it just seems like a completely stupid way of preventing spam. Because it isn&#039;t preventing it. It is cleaning up after the fact. <br /><br />edit: also I would like to add that I am not bothered by the spam, but I find it strange that a captcha has not been enabled for people without a hundred posts or so

				IF you cant stop the spam (which I dont see why captcha&#039;s for every user with under 20 posts wouldnt stop it) then stop their reason for exisiting.<br /><br />By this I mean, in the Silk Roads Login, under it, write a post saying &quot;www.whatever.com&quot; is a FRAUD do NOT&nbsp; buy your BTC here. This can be updated as they update their URL.. <br /><br />If you stop the people from wasting their money there, they will stop the spam as it will be useless.<br /><br />ps- OP writting in caps is just ugly.

				a captcha wont work because these spamming sources use methods to solve them automatically, i am in favor of recommending an automatic filter or other means to the admins as well though.<br /><br />also, it would have to be up to 250 posts, which is the most spam threads i have seen a single username post at one time, generally the minimum is around 70-150 posts before switching usernames recently

				you can get better captchas that can not be broken by computers.<br /><br />examples can be, pictures of animals and you are asked to name the animal.<br /><br />even more fucked up text, ect, there is a whole write up about them online and which ones are easy to break.. the one used here are easy to break.

				according to another member these automatic spam programs arent using computers to solve the captchas - they are actually forwarding them to a service which uses economically less fortunate people to do it for next to nothing in pay so its still profitable, dont know if this is accurate but that could be one reason they wont work <br /><br />like nomad said, posting your ideas here wont help, PM the admins if you want to motivate them to at least try something else. i dont have any power to implement such changes
