				Ok so here&#039;s the thing.<br /><br />I am tired of where my life is heading, there is nothing I want to do and I have no motivation or reason to do anything. Due to circumstances in my past my education and mental health suffered, turning me into some sort of sociopath.<br /><br />Over the past years (I&#039;m 18-21 and live in Scandinavia) I have considered and evaluated probably every crime known to man. Anything drug related (importing, synthing meth/MDMA, growing weed, etc.), all forms of theft, robbery, identity theft, fraud even becoming a hitman (I kid you not). I must have spend a couple hundred hours reading news articles, and anything crime related. I know I&#039;m smart, creative and capable but I&#039;ve just stopped caring about everything. I want to get rich fast and am willing to risk death and/or prison. There are only a few options that are feasible for me to attempt and none of them are really good enough. I don&#039;t have the criminal-knowledge or the contacts to import large amounds of drugs or inside information to pull off a robbery bigger than a corner store. My options are extremely limited, I could buy drugs on silkroad in bulk and sell them, but I&#039;ve done&nbsp; some calculations and I would have to sell a lot to make a decent profit, and I doubt I could do it for long without getting caught when selling at street level. The other option is some sort of robbery, a jewelry store pheraps. But both options are relatively high risk for minimal reward.<br /><br />I want to get rich, not mega rich but well-off, to me that means a 1-2 million dollar house and an anual income of 150-250k USD a year. I&#039;m quite knowledgeable in economics and I already know exactly the sort of investments I&#039;d make and some ideas/options on how to launder the money. Anything less and I might as well hang myself. I&#039;m not kidding, I&#039;m actually suicidal I think, but I figure I might as well attempt something to make me rich and I might find the will to live. I&#039;m on the edge, I would prefer to do something that doesn&#039;t hurt anyone or does damage to society, but really I don&#039;t give a shit anymore, anything goes.<br /><br />This thread will probably take a lot of crap, but whatever, I&#039;m sure there are some interesting people on SR that have some interesting stories or advice or whatever. So post your advice/info/thoughts here or send me a PM.

				First you need to step back and consider the fact that money is the center of your existence. That is not a good thing to revolve around. Look at how it is making you feel. Think about placing at the center of your universe something that can help you reach the goals you wish to achieve. God, a special person(temporarily), good health. Personally until I was able to reach a point where I decided something greater than myself existed my life was, as yours seems to be, in constant upheaval and turmoil. Not making the changes will take you places much worse than where you are. Think about it and let me know how you&#039;re doing.<br />I don&#039;t think anyone will be able to tell you how to become rich but you may find a way to become. Then many of the desires you seek will follow.<br />Scarecrow

I don&#039;t get any enjoyment from helping people and there is nothing I aspire to become or achieve. So what&#039;s left? There&#039;s stuff I should be doing like studying but I put it off as much as I can (I always do it and I always get good rsults) but to what end? I can&#039;t stand people, I don&#039;t even want to go to the shop or leave my house at all for that matter because I don&#039;t like talking, socialising or being in the pressence of other people, and ahead of me is a life where I will be forced to do it for every day until I die.

Prison doesn&#039;t bother me much. <br /><br />It&#039;s easy to say &#039;get a girl&#039; &#039;get a job&#039; but like I&#039;ve already said, I can&#039;t get a job and I&#039;ve tried getting a girl, twice, I&#039;m not the kinda guy that would start a relationship with anyone, I&#039;m quite specific and 99% of all girls are the same. <br /><br />I know I won&#039;t find meaning in money, that&#039;s not what I&#039;m after. I&#039;m after the freedom and comfortableness that money will enable me to have, when I have that I can begin my pursuit for happiness. I don&#039;t really know what you mean about my writing, &quot;Go write the next harry potter&quot; isn&#039;t very good advice and it doesn&#039;t solve my short term problems. I am actually interested in screenplay writing but the chances of that working out is miniscule so I&#039;m not going to waste my time on that now, it&#039;s something I plan on ever doing if I have enough money not to work. I need to get out the situation I am in. <br /><br />

				I think you think&nbsp; that money will solve all your problems. Social and mental. IT will not! I have known many people with money and they seem to have more issues/problems that someone that is poor. first, I would go talk to a therapist. Possibly get on some medication, you are most likely depressed or bi-polar. Money only solves some issues temporarily, usually it just creates more misery.<br /><br />I watched a documentary on 10-20 lottery winners. Every single one lost their entire fortune and family and some committed suicide or ended up in jail for stupid reasons.<br /><br />You need to focus on what you are good at. I can tell your smart. If your good at investment/economics. Go back to school. It doesn&#039;t matter how old you are, you can always go back.<br /><br />I have close family members that have a lot of money and everyone of them are idiots/jerks and wouldn&#039;t want to spend 10 minutes with them. You need to work hard. There is no get rich quick scheme that works. But, take my first advice and talk to a professional.<br /><br />Good luck to you. Hit me up any time.

				Assuming you;re a US resident or hcan obtain a work VISA or an F1 VISA, enroll in nursing school.&nbsp; You can still get a 2 year degree and pull $120K after a few years.&nbsp; While it&#039;s a far cry form the relative and ambiguous term &quot;rich,&quot; which incidentally is impossible to define.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT - Scandinavia has very lack emigration laws.... I suppose the policy justification is keeping the US as white as possible,

You know, crime is also a great way to become broke and lose your freedom.&nbsp; And considering the fact that you claim such intelligence, and creativity - why not step back from crime and tackle a legal occupation(which many smart people have done to get &quot;rich.&quot;)&nbsp; You state you don&#039;t have any criminal &quot;know-how.&quot;&nbsp; so why bother with crime?&nbsp; If you&#039;re not good at it don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; Crime isn&#039;t as forgiving as riding a bike with training wheels.<br /><br />&nbsp; If you stopped caring, why did you come here? Why do you care about becoming rich? There isn&#039;t any point if you don&#039;t care.&nbsp; If you want to talk about limited options - think about living in some mud hut, nothing to eat, in the middle of Ethiopia.&nbsp; There is opportunity all around us, even in the worst of conditions(maintain this mindset)<br /><br />&nbsp; You want to get rich?&nbsp; Most rich people I know have to spend at least several hundred thousand annually to STAY &quot;rich&quot; and by large most of their lives are hectic.&nbsp; What makes you think that once you&#039;re &quot;rich&quot; these feelings of yours will subside?&nbsp; They most likely won&#039;t - if you don&#039;t get to the root of the problem sooner than later.&nbsp; It&#039;s fine to want some money, and get things you&#039;ve always wanted -but what is the point in just saying &quot;fuck it&quot; and doing illegal shit/destroy someone&#039;s life?&nbsp; Work toward it while trying to balance things you find fun, there&#039;s no rush to find a girl/keep up with the Joneses.&nbsp; Browse GDP per capita by country and maybe your perspective on rich might change.&nbsp; Besides, what is the worth of a million dollar home in a inflated bullshit economy(majority of the 1stworld nations)? Can you tell me its true value?<br /><br />&nbsp; You are right about this thread taking crap, you sound like me a couple years ago.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m on my way to outright purchase my first property, a gf going on 2 years(first one in my life), and a new puppy.&nbsp; Get to work, and stop thinking negatively.<br />

				abuttelmao&#039;s guide to being rich:<br />1. Be born a white male to at least a middle class family in USA, Canada, or Western Europe<br />2. Get decent enough grades in school to go to a good university<br />3. Graduate from a university and get a job at a multinational corporation<br /><br />Congratulations, you are more rich than 99% of the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sounds like you are already in this situation, and like most other people who are, you are too sheltered and immature to appreciate the lot you&#039;ve rolled in life.&nbsp;
