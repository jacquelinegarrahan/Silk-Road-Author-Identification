				I&#039;m going to do something I&#039;ve never done in public.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to reach down between my legs, past my balls and stick my finger in some sludge that&#039;s been brewing since past dinner. Now I&#039;m going to stick it up to your nose. <br /><br />&quot;DO YOU SMELL IT?&quot;<br /><br />Of course not. I&#039;m typing this from a computer possibly a million miles from you. I have no interest in actually demonstrating anything to anyone because I certainly don&#039;t have my webcam on or even pointed towards me. I don&#039;t even have a dirty asshole so get that shit out of your mind.<br /><br />Which brings me to my point. 1) I am an asshole. No, I freely admit it.&nbsp; I&#039;m the hardest on the people closest to me. Which brings me to my second point. 2) This world needs assholes -unpopular fucking assholes.<br /><br />Assholes like me will tell people to their face what they are.<br /><br />Now some of you whom I love and hold dear are probably wondering &quot;What the fuck? I thought assholes like you hated us. Why do you bother even breathing?&quot; Others are like,&nbsp; &quot;I thought you were some troll.&quot; (Again) &quot;Why are you breathing?&quot;<br /><br />-It&#039;s because I have an addiction. Yeah, except that this isn&#039;t a 12 step brainwash and I can&#039;t use that kind of help. But I am here to testify. My addiction is to living free. It should be your addiction too.<br /><br />So far it seems that this forum is filled with very nice people that want to help you. Don&#039;t be deceived. I&#039;ve been around some of these types before online and offline. They act stupid and weak because it unbalances you as an opponent.&nbsp; You can&#039;t smell their shit because they are on the other side of a computer screen. Their goal is to get past you to whatever it is that they want. Many idiots will give it to them.<br /><br />Make no mistakes about it. There are people here who have no other goal than to leach off of you and your well being. They are not just LE but also scammers and bums... avoid them at all costs because Law Enforcement will try to fit in with these scammers and bums. This is what they do. It&#039;s called recon. They are here now. They are also not your friends.<br /><br />LE is on the other side as well, selling things to people. I may have fallen for one of their stings.&nbsp; Have you ever seen a deal that seemed too good to be true? On the silk road I suggest that you pass it up. I&#039;m not mentioning dealers yet and probably won&#039;t (because I&#039;m not logging in again).<br /><br />To be certain, I haven&#039;t had a CB yet. I have had a very nice new postal lady come by and deliver the mail &quot;extra special&quot; -past hours and including non-postal UPS stuff. It may be general paranoia but it also may be LE coming by to size me up. In any case I&#039;m not taking any chances and am flushing my wonderful crystal meth stash down the toilet. (The stuff&nbsp; which I am not smoking right now -of course).<br /><br />I&#039;m also deleting this shit off my computer. <br /><br />One thing that I notice is that there are certain people (bums we&#039;ll call them) who seem suspiciously absent of a job. They seem to hang out online here a lot and admit to doing a shitload of drugs. That&#039;s awesome dudes. But your risky behaviour shouldn&#039;t put anyone else at risk. Stop pushing the boundaries of behaviour that it keeping everyone safe from LE (for instance). They are not your friends.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s not like I&#039;m a major player and in fact I&#039;ve barely dabbled in anything and I know some very decent attorneys. (LE -if you are reading this -you may contact me through my attorney)...<br /><br />A lot of you come here and play like it&#039;s a little game. It is a game. Like everything in life it is fun... but the stakes are very high. For now I fold.<br /><br />If and when this shit blows over; I may be back... or not.<br /><br />God Speed<br /><br />The little guy once known as,<br />Smegma Turtle<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Sure I was a troll. This is not my regular post identity, I used it for making jokes, trolling bruce and calling out the obvious cops in this message board.<br /><br />I was right. There are/were lots of vendors on SR that were fake and just cops. If you bothered reading about NOD&#039;s arrest -they got him because they got someone else who ordered from Silkroad. They &quot;randomly&quot; opened one of his mails. The question is of course -is how did they know to open his mail?<br /><br />Anyways, it&#039;s over. Sorry. I am your friend.

				Great post, man. This thread is just like real life. Self-preservation is the #1 law of nature. Period. As long as everyone can admit that they&#039;re a piece of sh!t to some extent....we can reach agreement and understanding. Until then, deception and lies.<br /><br />I am a liar, a saint, a sinnner, righteous and a scammer. All on certain levels (i&#039;ve never consciously scammed somebody by giving beans away, but she thought they were shitty, even though i tested them. She FELT scammed cause she had been rolling four days straight and and had a nice benzo regimen going. somehow i&#039;m the scammer. i&#039;ll take it). The four friends I have in real life (i have hundreds, but real friends. c&#039;mon people....words mean things) I would trust with everything I own. They value our friendship more than cash, possessions, etc. <br /><br />My final act in office was lending a guy .35 btc (about what i spend in a month on SR on my meager income, yeah, i lost my 94k a year job cause of a dui last year) in the name of good karma. This fool was ordering 21 btcs worth of mda. Karma came indeed.
