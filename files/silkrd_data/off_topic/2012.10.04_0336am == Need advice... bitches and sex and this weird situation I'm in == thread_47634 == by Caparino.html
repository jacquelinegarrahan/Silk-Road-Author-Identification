				Alright. So I started off this semester and college in a new part of the country; little back story about my current mental situation, my ex was a bitch and broke my heart. I fucked a lot of bitches shortly after but I couldn&#039;t really fill that hole of confidence she left me with and started doing speed regularly to momentarily fill it, and before I knew it... <br /><br />Complication #1: I had premature ejaculation that I didn&#039;t really know how to solve except getting drunk as fuck&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Now back to current times, I&#039;m in a new setting at a new college. Not really a big deal, but between going to college this semester and the last semester I went; I&#039;ve had a year of being a social recluse and that lack of pussy got my insecurities up once more. Now, there&#039;s this tall 6ft1 cute German girl that&#039;s constantly been wanting my dick. I&#039;m talkin full on flirting, talking about sex and innuendos all over the place, and then today she walks by this random guy studying at a table while we&#039;re walking into the cafeteria from class; and it turns out it&#039;s her boyfriend but she doesn&#039;t even kiss him in front of me. <br /><br />Complication #2: She&#039;s got a boyfriend, and my morals are telling me to do everything but fuck her.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />So we&#039;re both coming back to school from grabbing some coffee from an off-campus Starbucks today, and the bitch tells me how her first time wasn&#039;t voluntary... and I&#039;m like, what da fuck. It went something like, she was doing vocals for a band she had with two dudes in high school(why she would use imagery to further describe the situation to me, I have no fucking idea, but I&#039;ll still pass it on), the dude&#039;s whose house it was had his parents leave and it started raining outside so they went inside. &quot;I think me being in my wet clothes didn&#039;t help the situation&quot;, and that&#039;s when they forced her onto the bed and a minute after breaking her hymen, the dude in her vagina hit his balls on the edge of the bed frame and she got a chance to run into the bathroom. That&#039;s makes the next complication...<br /><br />Complication #3: She got her virginity basically raped, and now she&#039;s a closet nympho.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />So the pros and cons how I see them.<br /><br />Pros: I can fuck this fine crazy bitch to bring my confidence back up, fulfill all of my sexual fantasies cause I know she&#039;s submissive in bed, get rid of my sexual tensity build up--because honestly after you&#039;ve had a lot of sex, at first you&#039;re like &quot;I&#039;ve basically had sex with every body and personality type of woman out there so it really doesn&#039;t do anything anymore&quot; but stopping abruptly and not even getting a fucking blowjob in a year&#039;s time fucking sucks--and I don&#039;t have time to go parties while I&#039;m double majoring in Physics and Engineering and balancing a part time job, so this is the perfect thing on the side. I basically have a study/fuck buddy that I can fuck whenever cause she&#039;ll always be DTF... Smart, cute, taller than me, German American. Think of that Blonde Amazonian from Futurama ;)<br /><br />Cons: I&#039;m scared I still have my residual pre-jaculation tendencies because it&#039;s based on muscle memory and the last few times I fucked above the influence of alcohol a year ago, I came early; if I shoot early this time, it&#039;s just gonna lower my confidence with girls again and wanna avoid that. I really really have a problem with her having a boyfriend; I&#039;ve been in his shoes and that&#039;s a fucking terrible thing to happen to you--on the bright side, I&#039;m glad it happened sooner than later in when it happened to me, so I&#039;d really be helping this guy out (says my penis :P). <br /><br />All advice and input appreciated cause it&#039;s more than likely gonna go down in the next couple days&nbsp; :D

				MDMA...<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t help with the shooting off too early (which it should) at least you be all mellow about it and don&#039;t care...<br /><br />Actually, whether you do her or not, you sound like you could use a good E experience. Helps you with those deep-down anxieties and insecurities.

				Honestly dude, if the bitch is willing to cheat on her boyfriend, you are doing him a favor. Just don&#039;t forget what shes willing to do to him cuz she do the same to you. Fuck and don&#039;t get attached, maybe get her attached to you, that&#039;d be fun?

Mind you though, if you ejaculate prematurely viagra won&#039;t stop that, might even make it worse. On V my cock gets pumped up more than usual, you know, like thick veins all around. That extra tension makes you even more sensitive down there. So taking V might backfire.<br /><br />As for the E. Why not go with a very low threshold dose instead of a full roll? Like around 60 to 80mg. You will get mild effects with tremendous sex and anxiety relieve without the hassles of a nasty hangover.<br /><br />Also, if you prepare and supplement proper with Trypto/5-HTP you should be hangover-free on such low doses.<br /><br />Just brainstorming dude...

				Alright, I&#039;ll account for the boyfriend aggro now.<br /><br />Johnwholesome, so if I come on viagra then it won&#039;t get hard again? The problem isn&#039;t coming fast, it&#039;s the cooldown time between rounds 1 and 2! <br /><br />As for the bitch, naaaah, I&#039;m not getting attached for shit. I&#039;m gonna fuck her and make her do favors for me cept the homework, I&#039;m actually helping her out with that lol.

				Yo<br />Try some xanax for the prem ejaculation, its possible your PE is caused by anxiety possibly due from your ex cheating on you and it kinda fucks with your confidence, ive had a chick do that to me and i know its not very nice. The xanax will take your anxiety away and throw all performance head fuck shit out the window. <br /><br />And to be honest the German sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, tap then gap bro, she sounds like more trouble than its worth and it could be broken heart #2.<br /><br />Peace

				Just rub one out before you head out on your next date with her. Just make sure you clean up before she comes knocking on your door and theres no cum hanging off your ear. Because then she&#039;ll take it and use it as hair gel, lol. Kinda like in that movie &quot;theres something about mary&quot;.<br /><br />Remember when that happened in that movie? Lol.

				If you have mild premature ejaculation, in the instance you can last 5 minutes, but would like to go for 10, there&#039;s no need to worry. You&#039;ll be able to improve this situation by simply distracting yourself, when your close to coming, just think about something completely irreverent to prolong the action! ;) You could always use local anesthetic gel/cream, condoms for longer loving that contain benzocaine or lidocaine, different brands in different countries have different names, for example where I am, a good one is called Durex Performa, just google for longer lovemaking condoms in your country. And learn foreplay, it comes with experience, and is a great deterrent for premature ejaculation, and makes the time spent together a lot more rewarding and stimulating.<br /><br />Regarding your dilemma to fuck or not fuck her, she&#039;s obviously game, so the ball is in your court, just remember that choices have consequences, and would you like that to happen to you? Think long and hard about it, no pun intended lol! But wouldn&#039;t it be better for you to find a nice girlfriend, or fuck buddy (whatever you prefer) that&#039;s all yours, or have no strings attached, or would it be better to fuck her and risk the consequences, it&#039;s up to you, and only you can come to the best decision for yourself, but I would highly recommend before you do anything you get on top of your premature ejaculation first, as it&#039;s really getting to you, and is more than likely to control your fears until you conquer it.<br /><br />Best of luck with you decision, your double majoring in physics and engineering, and your part time job :)

				With only reading the first post:<br /><br /><br />I would be fucking that bitch in to text week.<br /><br /><br />Trojan makes a condom called something like &quot;extended pleasure&quot; or some shit. When I was your age I used them every now and again. The got some lube that numbs your cock.<br /><br />You will damn near have to take the thing off to bust your nut.<br /><br />So if you tying to remain slick. Have one of those condoms and one regular. Put that shit on fuck till the sun comes up, then act like its dry or bothering you and switch to a regular.<br /><br />&nbsp;= bust it on that fucking german bukakka freaks face!<br /><br />Hero points for pictures of the aftermath!<br />

				Alright so for short term of that premature ejac; I&#039;m thinking of desensitizing cream/that condom shroom mentioned, and doing calculus in my head to distract myself from getting too into it lol <br /><br />Princess, thanks for all your advice from the other side was kinda exactly what I was waiting for!

I have heard that desensitizing cream is a godsend for premature ejaculation, and if calculus will help, do as much as you can until you explode! I&#039;ve just done a quick google, desensitizing cream, in the UK you can purchase over the counter from Boots, and in the USA Walmart, there are also many online places that sell it such as Amazon and Ebay. Do keep us updated on how you get on, best of luck to you&nbsp; :)

Take both at least 2 hours before fucking.&nbsp; You can order these from a couple guys on here.<br /><br />The 100mg of viagra will make your dick so swollen with blood it will actually make it less sensitive(at least for me).&nbsp; Vardenafil is somewhat like viagra but has properties that fight pre-ejac.&nbsp; Learned through research and thanks to steroid use! <br /><br />Don&#039;t waste your time foreplaying with this cheating bitch if you don&#039;t want her to get wrong idea.&nbsp; It&#039;ll make you look like you want to put effort in to this fake relationship and possibly look like a bitch to her.&nbsp; If I read correctly, your plan was to be fuckbuddies or just just tap it once.&nbsp; If she is going to cheat on her bf, she&#039;ll do it right to you, she could be well fucking other dudes as we speak and she is playing YOU.&nbsp; I had a bitch(thought it was true love, yeah right) that cheated on me multiple times, literally felt her guilt in my gut every time as she was younger than me and I could read her too well, finally found out for real when a kid told me what was going on(shit he was probably fucking her too).&nbsp; Fucked her couple of friends so whatever.<br /><br />Also those desensitizing creams/gels may work, but I have heard of girls complaining that it numbs their twat too. Not that it should matter for this girl, but if you happen to use it with someone who you really want to pleasure, keep that in mind.<br /><br />good luck!&nbsp; typing this in the hospital on my phone from my car crash just for you!

And oh as far as the playing goes, fuck that shit. I&#039;m gonna hit it as much as I can before the bitch starts acting crazy, meanwhile I&#039;ll use her as much as I can. Oh and I read that about the desensitizing, that&#039;s why I&#039;ll coat it on my dick and then the condom goes on top :D<br /><br />So the general consensus is that viagra DOES make you last longer. So that combined with the cream and I should be good to go? I&#039;d take opiates but I&#039;m getting tested atm so I can&#039;t fuck around :/<br /><br />Joey my man, you know they&#039;re the hottest. Hahaha if the sex-aids don&#039;t come through for me I&#039;m definitely doing exactly that. Already thinking of any boyfriend aggro though. You know what this bitch deserves though? Me fucking her numerous times and getting it on video, then revealing it to her boyfriend, how&#039;s that sound&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Edit: The fuck is faygo?

				Sry to hear your getting tested i know all to well how that is (just figured if you could take mdma that wasn&#039;t a problem).. so the opiates or out<br /><br />But the Kratom i spoke of early does not show up on any drug test!! I&#039;m telling you this stuff does wonders for me and several close friends say the same thing...<br /><br />as far as Viagra, it didn&#039;t make me last longer but there were no &quot;long&quot; breaks in-between sessions (in fact if the wind blew up my shorts it was on).. I got no comment on the cream but i heard it will burn the shit out of her if theres any contact, and how can ya get head with numming cream all over your dick???
