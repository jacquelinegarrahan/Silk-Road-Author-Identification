				So with the amount of scamming pieces of shit on here seemingly growing by the day, is it maybe worth discussing what drives these fucking cunts, apart from the obvious desire for money over everything. What actually goes on in there head Id like to know? How do they justify their actions? How do you get to such a low point that you think its acceptable to steal from another human being without batting an eyelid? I suppose one good thing is that you can use these slimy fucks as a kinda yardstick: no matter how far you fall, youll never be as low as say a Nathan Jordan.

I know that they do get hit by scam buyers, and probably deal with some shady exchangers robbing their coins, but I doubt you could prove that any vendor (or probably group of vendors) has lost a quarter mil. to scam buyers. And that was just a single scammer over a single weekend, it doesn&#039;t take into account all the other rip offs that have done the same thing.

				I have to agree with wretched. There is no doubt some vendors get scammed by buyers regularly but the scale of scamming by some vendors such as the Tony76 one is way bigger than any perpetrated by a buyer. This is why Escrow is so important in minimizing the opportunity for scamming. I know it doesn&#039;t stop it, but it takes away the biggest and easiest opportunity a vendor may have at scamming.
