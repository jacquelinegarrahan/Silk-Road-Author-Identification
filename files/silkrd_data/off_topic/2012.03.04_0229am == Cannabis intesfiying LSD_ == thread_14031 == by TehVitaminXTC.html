				It seems to me that whenever I smoke on LSD that my trip gets well way more trippyier in the sense my whole trip has went from a ++ to a ++++. (most likely exaggerating but you get the point)<br /><br />

				You are simply stacking drugs, most people forget that THC is a psychoactive drug. I always suggest to smoke cannabis after peaking on any psychedelic.

				Yes, THC + LSD has the same effect on me. I love to smoke a bowl as I&#039;m coming down :)<br />Weed is weed, but weed on LSD is something different

				In general, I find that cannabis potentiates psychedelic chemicals.&nbsp; I often smoke twice when tripping: once while (or immediately after) dosing, and again as the peak starts to wane.&nbsp; The first smoke session is an intoxication transition, and the second tends to catapult me back into the peak of the trip for another hour or so.

				Oh man. I&#039;ve toked on both of my shroom trips and my acid trip and it was the best thing. In fact, with the acid trip I felt that I didn&#039;t really break through until I smoked. I had taken 120 ug and thought &quot;this is pretty cool, but is this really what LSD is like?&quot; so then my friends and I figured that we should smoke since when they were all doing these psychedelics in the &#039;70s they most definitely were smoking a ton of weed, and after a few puffs, that&#039;s when stuff started melting... Good times. :)

				it&#039;s a scientific fact.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember the details but it was something about blocking certain receptors and increasing the affinity to others.<br /><br />hopefully someone can explain this concept better.

				Mary Jane really has great Synergy with Lucy if you ask me, but it get&#039;s in the way of DMT I&#039;ve found. When mixed with Lucy it get&#039;s pretty far out psychedelic wise, but when mixed with Dimitri it really keeps me connected to the Earth, it keeps me from traveling to far off destinations.

				Oh hell yeah it does! The first time I smoked weed while on LSD I laid on a bed and listened to Hendrix with my eyes closed while I was overcome with pulses of energy and light flowing through my head to my feet then I started to feel like I was lifting away from my body. The feeling was really hard to describe, and it was slightly overwhelming since I was a noob with acid back then but shit was it incredible.
