				I got some LSD in mail. (P.S. English is not my first language)<br /><br />Day one:<br />19:00 my girlfriend took 1/2 of blotter.<br />21:00 she took the other half.<br />23:30 she is tripping balls, fighting with alien ships, trying to connect to my brain (while I was sleeping already) etc interesting LSD stuff happening stretched to 4 hours. Visuals were crazy, lights bright, she could hear each sound of the music.<br /><br />Fast forward two days.<br />20:00 I took one blotter. Feeling a little &quot;onset&quot;.<br />22:00 I took half blotter. Feeling nothing than &quot;onset&quot;.<br />23:30 now while I&#039;m writing this, I&#039;m not really high, not even close to what she was describing/feeling with only half+half. I can easily write this post, no visuals.<br /><br />Question is: how is this even possible?<br /><br />She is 55kg, I&#039;m 75kg.<br />Both systems free from LSD a month at least<br />LSD was stored in plastic bag, between pages of a book, in ~20-25 Celsius room temperature. No moisture, no light. (no degradation here)<br />Blotters are supposed to be 150ug. From TOP seller on Silk Road.<br />We are not experienced users, third time only.<br />

				Either the tabs were bunk and she exaggerated, or you have weird body chemistry. Try again in one or two weeks and see how it goes.

				Probably bunk tabs. Tolerance for LSD builds quickly so wait a while between trips. Although you should have felt something unless they were super weak or just nothing.

				maybe a really unevenly laid sheet?ive had one side of a strip seem to be stronger than the other side before perhaps something similer could of happened in your case.

				Thanks for the responses. I was feeling something. Or maybe unevenly lied sheet.<br />And after reading about this stuff - maybe my mind was not in the right mood/set. Source: www.psychedelic-library.org/

				It&#039;s possible some of the tabs were damaged but not completely destroyed. My guess would be uneven blotter and maybe also damage. But definitely uneven blotter, that seems like the most common issue. Easy for that to happen and not big enough of a deal for a lot of vendors to focus on fixing.

				Must have been one of those freak trips you always hear about, he tripped so hard that reality just became too real. ::)

				I honestly wonder how much placebo plays into this. I doubt you could trick yourself into actually tripping, but I wonder if it&#039;s possible to trip pretty hard by convincing yourself you took a large dose when it was actually fairly small.

				Placebo? I think with meditation one could reach something like LSD experience.<br />Next time (after ~1-2 weeks) I&#039;ll take two tabs and in the right setting with the right mindset. Then we&#039;ll see :)

You could definitely have some kind of spiritual, mind blowing experience on it, but it would probably be very different from LSD.

				The chemical structure of lsd is compromised very easily due to poor storage conditions. Its a very vulnerable chem.

				I posted about storage properties already at the beginning.<br />I don&#039;t want to point with fingers because maybe it&#039;s not the sellers fault in a way that he have no control about it?<br />I&#039;ll take from the other side of sheet next time and then we&#039;ll see about even/uneven laid. And if from two tabs will be nothing, then I&#039;ll post the seller. Will this be a fair deal?

Got any other sources? This is interesting to me.

				Well, I had the same experience.<br />Today I took my first LSD blotter (150mg form a top and well rated seller on SR)<br />I took it like 2 hours ago, and now I just feel a slight weakness and my head is a bit heavy, nothing else.<br />Maybe I will try and take a second one later. The blotter where delivered in a plastic bag, the whole package was ok and they were not damaged in any way.<br /><br />

				Just updating the above post... 1 hour after writing it the LSD began at last taking effect and WOW... it has lasted almost 24 hours.<br />I should have had more patience, maybe it took much longer to take effect as I took it right after lunch.<br />Anyway, really good trip, and I want to spend also some words about the seller PremiumDutch (I bought it from him):<br />Seeing that the LSD was taking no effect I wrote him to notify this: I didn&#039;t asked a for a refund, just told him what was happening<br />he was extremely kind and promised me some extra bonus on the next purchase (which obviously I will not request, as <br />the LSD was indeed good).<br /><br />cheers,<br />A.
