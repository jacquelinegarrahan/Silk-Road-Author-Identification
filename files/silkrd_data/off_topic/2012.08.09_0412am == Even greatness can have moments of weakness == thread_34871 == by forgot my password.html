				Today a person of intellect beyond your comprehension made a mistake today. <br /><br />I placed a order with a vendor that always worked out great for me and I&#039;m pretty sure he turned scammer. <br /><br />TL;DR<br />I forgot to check the forum before ordering, I was a dumbass for precisely 5 minutes today. I don&#039;t see how you guys can live this dumb all the time.
