				Genius suggestion!<br />Ok heres two:<br /><br />1st one:<br />I was on shrooms, did it the old aztec/mayan, whatever the fuck way and ate only fruit the day before and starved my self the entire day of dosing. ate an entire 1/8th, had a unreal time....it was about 5 am when i was coming down and i told my friend to drive me home (i was 17 at the time, in highschool, and snuck out the house to trip balls) as he was driving me, my dad calls, FUUUMMINGGG, im talking yelling like a banshee. The hostility in him triggered my trip or something, i got a bad vibe and realized that i needed to get myself home asap. I was so worried and needed to get there so badly that my friends driving didnt suffice. I thought to myself a car can not do it. I told him to stop the car and i began running, i look to the left of me, and my friend is coasting next to me, and says, &quot;ugh...what the fuck are you trying to do?:&quot;&nbsp; to which i assertively yell back &quot;running faster than you car will ever go....&quot; i look at him and we DIEEE LAUGHING...i literally thought i could run faster than a car <br /><br />Now the second is a really&nbsp; REALLY fucked up one.<br /><br />College years: I was at a fraternity party, we made all the chicks there drop E, shit was getting crazy. I ended up taking a bunch of xanax coming off my roll....did a bar, and drank a few beers (like a fucking idiot)&nbsp; anyways, i dont remember shit but this is the story told to me by at least 6 other people:<br />Apparently, i took a girl, was making out with her and told her to come back to my place (again, no recollection of any of this but good for me for auto-piloting sealing the deal with a bitch) I aimlessly walk to a room that isnt mine. I open the door and stare blankly into it...i get a tap on my shoulder (it was my friends room, it was him tapping me) he asks me to leave, I tell him to fuck off and that its my room and keep stairing into the room. He begins to aggressively tell me to leave and i push him (at this point the girl i was going to hook up with vanishes)&nbsp; now the reason my friend got angry was....i was starring in a room where his girlfriend was in, lying naked on his bed yelling for me to get out. And I was starring at her, like a fucking creep. I dont remember shit, but i ended up getting punched in the face. people told me i went down hard. woke up a few minutes later yelling &quot;why?&nbsp; whyyy ? while pointing at my bruised eye. I then FOR SOME REASON decided to take a shower. i left the shower running and people found me butt naked passed out on the floor. One person said they saw me laying on the floor using my hands on my body with a gesture as if i had soap in my hand (there was no soap in there) needless to say, it was a story passed around for a while and all parties were in good laughs (including my friend who punched me and his naked lady bitch) as for the girl i was gonna hook up with...not so much

				a while back we brought 7 grams of mephedrone between 4 people, we had already worked our way through about 5 grams, when another friend came over who had just come back from a heavy night of drinking in the local town. We told him that we were taking drone and he didnt know much about it other than it used to be legal. So with that knowledge he thought it was completely safe to be a dick (this is heavily alcohol influenced) He saw the remaining ~2grams of drone on the table and within about 20seconds he had sniffed the lot. I had never seen anything like it, he went into a sneezing fit spewing white powder everywhere and then he started to cough up powder. Then about 5 minutes later he literally started eating his packet of cigarettes, then he passed out onto the floor actually physically eating the floor. He was eating the carpet for about 3 hours straight, his mouth looked like a furball by the time he stopped.<br />But yeah alcohol can make a nice person turn into a right ego manic dick. But he repaid us for the waste of drone even though he doesnt remember anything but it was pretty funny watching him at the time haha&nbsp; 8)

				LOL at the 2nd story StickAFinger, +1 for that :P<br /><br />This one time at a rave I drank waay too much already before it even started. Dropped an E (heavy one, think the old blue mitsubishi) before entering, so the party was on... Inside of course more beer and I also dropped an MDMA cap with ~200mg in it, totally fucking blew me off the face of the earth. I have no recollection from ~12pm till 5am but apparently (i was told) somewhere in the evening I was waiting in front of a door (which I thought was the toilet) for like 15-30minutes complaining to everyone that it took freaking long before someone came out. Then a friend came to search me cause he got worried because I stayed away for so long, he found me staring at the supply closet door&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Also the weirdest thing happened around 5am, I suddenly &#039;woke up&#039; and from that moment on I can remember the evening :P It was so weird, when I &#039;woke up&#039; I couldn&#039;t remember what I did the 5-6hours before that and I thought the party just started, but instead it was almost over&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Last time I ever did so much beer + mdma, no fun.. Makes a good story tho, still hear it at least once a month and it happened like almost 5 years ago&nbsp; ;D

				This is the story of my first and only alcohol overdose:<br />I was on a school trip in Tuscany, Italy. We were basically a mob of 70 drunk 17-18 year olds. Okay so one night I went into a bar with a group of like ten people and we were drinking cocktails and stuff but the drinks they served there must have consisted of 60% pure alcohol because I drank three drinks in a short time, not thinking that this amount of alcohol would cause me any trouble. After this I went back to the hotel (about a 15 minute walk) and on the way I was consistently getting more drunk. I entered the hotel and from this point I have no recollection of what happened. This is what my buddies told me the next morning:<br />I entered the room which I shared with seven of my buddies and I had the top of a bunk bed so I managed to climb up and lay down. Then I realized that I&#039;m going to puke so I tried to get out of the bed as quickly as possible. I basically just rolled sideways off the bed, plummeting from 1.7 meters on the stone floor, landing on my stomach and face. I then sat up and puked on my buddie&#039;s bed. My other roommates were enjoying the show laying on their beds smoking joints. After I puked I had to puke more so I ran to the bathroom and puked my fucking guts out. Then I went to sleep. When I woke up everyone was looking at me with a big grin and I tried desperately to remember what had happened last night but I couldn&#039;t.

				Schooltrips, since many generations a big source for embarrassing, yet epic tales. <br /><br />I remember my schooltrip to Berlin when I was like 14-15 and we got 1 evening off... Ahaha teachers expected us to visit museums and shit, but we decided to hit the bar 8) Totally illegal of course, the smallest glass they had was a 0,5 liter one ;D All I remember is my first 3 beers and then all black till next morning I woke up in a bathtub, covered in my own vomit&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Friends later told me that I also fell out of a bunk bed, from the top.. I stood up and fell down laughing on the ground. Also a teacher showed up in our room checking in on us, can you imagine 5 14-15 year old drunk boys in a room.. epic stuff. <br /><br />Ahhh.. highschool... kinda miss it, although I never really properly enjoyed it :P<br /><br />

				I was at a carnival on LSD and stupidly decided to hit up the coconut shy in a state of profound disarray. I went into this zone of connectedness and knocked a coconut off with every single shot, including getting two with the last ball with the luckiest ricochet I&#039;ve ever seen. My friend then got the fuzz called on him because he kept hysterically demanding a unicorn burger from the food stall whilst interchangeably falling into bouts of manic laughter and shouting the phrase &quot;I swear officer she was only 15&quot; over and over again. I was having ridiculous visuals at the time and was having to hold it together and talk sense to my friend all the while his face is morphing with fractal beams of crystal clear multi-coloured light emanating from his soul, not to mention my sense of time was phasing in and out to a ridiculous degree. We must have looked insane.<br /><br />We ended up sheltering under a bridge where my friend tried to build a sundial out of a broken hub cap and some empty cans. An astounded look then appeared on his face and what seemed like a profound realisation passed across him, only for him to say &quot;The serpent king sleeps, he is nigh&quot; like it was the most important thing in the world. I remember it perfectly because he wouldn&#039;t stop saying it for the next solid hour. To this day he maintains that he had no idea what happened and genuinely believed himself to be a monkey God living in an alternate hindu style universe, where he observed the passing of universes from what he dubbed his &quot;ruby emerald star ship&quot; but then was pulled back down to earth because he betrayed his wife. He doesn&#039;t actually know how he &quot;betrayed&quot; her.. he just says that that was the distinct impression that he got. It&#039;s odd how fragile ideas like that sometimes carry so much weight when you&#039;re in a psychedelic state. <br /><br />

				This is the&nbsp; most fucked up ive ever gotten and one of the worst experiences ontop of that.....<br /><br />So me and a couple guys got pinched breaking into an apartment i guess a nosey neighbour called the cops anyway...I was drunk and had already popped a couple beans I had another 5 left in my pocket that the cops managed to miss when they searched me :P So while I was in the back of the cruiser I got them out of my pocket and hid them between my ass cheeks. When I got to the station they searched me again but again they missed them. They put me in a holding cell right away after the door closed I grabbed the beans and popped them all no water nothing....let me tell you that was the worst taste ive ever had in my entire life. Well after about 1 hour I was rolling so fucking hard the tiles on the floor where moving by the time the cop came in to interrogate me my jaw was clenching so hard I couldnt talk. They knew right away I had taken something and given my state took me to the hospital. i spent the night there and was taken to court the next morning...horrible fucking experience.

				I was rolling hard last night at a show, but nothing extraordinary happened.<br /><br />At one point I was outside in the smoking area and a few yards away there was a guy sitting down with the biggest grin on his face. He was just staring at his arm, and it was so obvious he was tripping balls. I was pretty happy just watching him trip.<br />I brought an awesome mask to the show, and whenever I would see a picture being taken, I would do my damn best to bomb it. This was no ordinary mask either. This was a really fucking creepy mask. I think I got in some good pics.<br /><br />There was another show I went to, my first night rolling actually, and there was a dude in the crowd with a UV sensitive white shirt on. You could draw on him with a purple laser pointer, which we so happened to have. I freaked the fuck out when I first saw it. My friend and I just couldn&#039;t get enough of it, and I think I payed more attention to the dude&#039;s shirt than I did to the music. We wrote things like 420, ROLL, I LOVE MEN (or was it COCK...), and stupid shit like that, and naturally, we drew a penis at one point.<br />We drew him some pecs and an 8-pack too. That was really fun

				This recent new years a couple of friends and i decide to make our first batch of weed brownies with a few o&#039;s of trim<br />. Anyway we get to preparing the brownies making oil and mixing it wIth the brownie mix once we get that all done and put in the oven. I lick the remaining batter that we couldn&#039;t get into the pan. 15 minutes later I tell my buddies dude i think i feel it from the batter but i&#039;m not really sure mostly thinking my body is fucking with me. They start to bust my balls saying i&#039;m full of shit etc. <br /><br />So once the brownies are done we all break a piece off for each of us not thinking any thing. My one bud and i kept going at the brownies because we had the munchies from smoking earlier in the day and 20 mins or so had passed without really feeling a coming up. That was a mistake no more then 10 minutes later we started to feel them kick in and they kicked in hard. I was tripping putnseeing shit like i took a hit of acid lol, I could barley move or talk we were so fucked up we didnt even go out for new years in a major party friendly city. My one buddy passed out at 1030 or so and we ate them at 900. Any way i had to be at work early next morning so i had them take me to work. i forgot to memtion we were outnof town so we had to leave at like 8 in the morning for me to get to work at like 11~ So sleeping in the back and they wake me up saying were at my place of work. They bust out laughing saying Dude trollsquad your eyes are fucking blood shot.&nbsp; I say i fucking bet man i&#039;m still fucking spinning like crazy.<br /><br />I go into work first thing my manager says your fucked go wash your face blah blah. All day she kept calling me out on being mad high. I kept leaning and could barley stand up staight she had a blast making fun of me.&nbsp; a few days later i decide to eat more brownies but i took it easy and had a very small squared&nbsp; to test the waters. To my surprise&nbsp; that more then enough to get me high<br />Tl,dr I ate super potent brownies about 5 times more then i really needed to and went to work barely able to stand the next day

				Background info:I had my fun with dxm when i was younger. I always seemed to have a good time except for the vomiting. You know how hard it is to guzzle down three bottles of cough syrup. I started developing tolerance over time. I happen to stumble across a website that sold dxm powder. I was so excited and knew i would get it cheaper for buying in bulk. Short on cash i was only able to purchase five grams.<br /><br />I remember sitting on my back porch smoking a blunt. (A honey dutch master cigar&nbsp; to be exact. that&#039;s back when i use to smoke cigs and blunts.) I added some about 1 to 1.5 grams of dxm into a shot glass, added some vodka and downed it. Dxm has this horrible taste that seems to be able to linger. Yuck. I finished my blunt and begin to roll another one because i knew once the dxm kicked in i would no longer have the ability to roll. A few hours passed and i begin to get visuals. I decided that i wasn&#039;t high enough so i downed some more dxm powder. (bad idea, but eh i was young, and thought i was superman.) The visuals got insanely intense and i memory was getting fuzzy. <br /><br />I remember stepping outside to smoke that next blunt and that&#039;s the last thing i remember. i remember tasting that blunt and then bam i was in the back of a cop car. When i realized where i was, the only thing i could think was. &quot;wow those lights are so pretty.&quot; Once i realized i was in the back of a cop car and i wasn&#039;t tripping i was in a cop car. Stupidly i discarded of the evidence by consuming the remaining powder. Apparently i was so calm when the police arrived that they didn&#039;t even cuff me because i was so young.&nbsp; Insane visuals, i remember hysterically laughing and the police asking me over and over what did i take. Every time they asked me that question i would begin uncontrollable laughing again. <br /><br />Then however much i consumed in the car made me black out. I woke up in a hospital. Apparently i had fell over and wasn&#039;t responding to any form of stimuli and my breathing was so impaired they thought i had overdosed. I remember waking up, looking around the hospital room, wondering if i had hurt myself. So i begin to check my body, realizing i was handcuffed to the hospital bed. <br /><br />I was still tripping pretty hard and when i would move my fingers, colors would spark off them. Purples and blues. It was so beautiful. The nurse informed that i was under evaluation and asked me what did i take. I told her that i hadn&#039;t took anything. She could clearly tell i was lien. She then told me that during the night i was kept screaming over and over the following words. &quot;Who am i?&quot; She informed me that they gave me ativan to put me out because they were afraid i was going to hurt myself or someone else. <br /><br />Even today, i sometimes have flashbacks of being in that cop car and in the hospital. It was a crazy experience that helped me grow and realize that every drug has it limits. Your body and mind has a limit. Every time you cross the limit of a drug or your body, You should be thankful you live through it.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Some people might find that story humorous. I know i do personally. But, then again maybe no one will find it funny because it&#039;s one of those. You had to be there/do it to find it funny. If you have never came through in the back of a cop car/jail/hospital/court. Then you might just think i&#039;m a retard haha. <br /><br />Respect oneself, Respect the drug, and Respect the experience.

At the time, it was winter break and I go to a commuter school were most everybody lives in the city where my school is located.&nbsp; I lived in the dorms, which were closed over break, so instead of going home (which honestly isn&#039;t an option) I stood in the frat house.&nbsp; On new year, we planned out a party and invited a shit ton of people.&nbsp; My buddy (we&#039;ll call him John) was selling me stupid cheap $100 ounces of shrooms which I was moving out of my frat house-I had about 12 grams going into this party.<br /><br />At this time I was kinda seeing (well, fucking) this girl (we&#039;ll call her jessica) and was desiring to trip shrooms that night.&nbsp; I knew she was coming up so&nbsp; I asked her via text if she wouldn&#039;t mind if &quot;did a hallucinogenic drug&quot;.&nbsp; She responded with &quot;I&#039;d rather you not :)&quot; which was a polite way of saying &quot;i don&#039;t want you doing fucking drugs&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />The night started off pretty slow-people were out at clubs and bars and there weren&#039;t many people here before midnight-maybe about 30.&nbsp; During this time I drank copious amounts of beer, liquor, jello shots, and even fucking champagne&nbsp; (fuckin frat parties).&nbsp; John came up here with his fat bitch girlfriend and had in his possession chocolate covered shrooms.&nbsp; He offered me two decent sized ones, and I accepted given the intoxicated state that I was in thinking &quot;Nobody will notice if I have a little body high&quot; The things were fucking gross as they were still kinda fresh!&nbsp; I vomited profusely shortly after consuming them, and was under the impression that I had &quot;threw up my trip&quot;.&nbsp; I went into the room I was staying in, broke open my hippie stash, and ate a handful of dried p. cubbies.&nbsp; <br /><br />I go back downstairs where I did a keg stand or two and went to the basement to see who I could grind on.&nbsp; We have all types of lighting we use for parties in our basement, and I noticed I started trippin when the lights were making all types of fucked up patterns on the wall.&nbsp; This is when the shit show ensued:<br /><br />I went back upstairs to find Jessica and her sister sitting on the couch playing a drinking game.&nbsp; Jessica, I guess, had informed her sister of my request to eat drugs, and she was the first one to notice that I wasn&#039;t right.&nbsp; I started avoiding them for the time being because I was starting to get paranoid they found out I was tripping.&nbsp; I started drinking any alcohol in sight in hopes of having my drunken state overcome me tripping my fucking balls off because these two girls were staying the night here and I REALLY didn&#039;t want them finding out I was fucked up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hid out in the chapter room with one of my brothers who recently went alumni who I didn&#039;t know very well prior to this.&nbsp; I just outright told him what I had done earlier in the night, and was actually impressed with how many boomers I had consumed that I was still able to form complete sentences.&nbsp; He reassured me that everything was okay, all while I&#039;m staring at the composite pictures (pictures we take every year of every member of the frat) fucking morph into little alien looking beings wearing suits.&nbsp; It was a VERY powerful mental trip.<br /><br />I remained in this room for a while when Jessica and her sister came into the room and sat down next to me.&nbsp; The guy I was with had left.&nbsp; I invited some of my high school buddies to the party&nbsp; who found me and proceeded to spark a blunt in the chapter room (which is very much against our bi-laws, and people DO care).&nbsp; After we smoked, I was gone.&nbsp; Jessica&#039;s cunt sister started saying shit to me like &quot;How are those Red Robin MUSHROOM and swiss burgers tonight?&quot; &quot;I bet those MUSHROOMS tasted good on your pizza earlier!&quot;&nbsp; I started getting horrible vibes, naturally, but still reenforcing the fact that I hadn&#039;t ate drugs.&nbsp; The bitches actually believed it!&nbsp; It astounded me, because at this point I had drank enough alcohol to intoxicate my entire family, ate &quot;a handful&quot; of mushies, and smoked a blunt of headband bud.&nbsp; Looking back, they were pretty fucked up as well.<br /><br />I find john who insists I eat his last chocolate mushie.&nbsp; I thought I was in the clear and already &quot;convinced&quot; jessica and her sister I was &#039;sober&#039; so I didn&#039;t hesitate.&nbsp; I went into a room off to our basement and consumed what I could of it, before almost immediately vomiting.&nbsp; This time it was bad-I could not stop thinking I was throwing up my soul and all of my emotions.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t feeling good at all, so I went upstairs to the room where I was staying.&nbsp; Jessica&#039;s sister went into the room with one of my bro&#039;s and fucked him so she was gone for the night (and thank god!)&nbsp; One of my bros passed out naked in my bed I was staying in, completely wrapped up in my recently washed sheets buck fucking naked.&nbsp; I rolled him off the bed onto the floor, where one of my brothers proceeded to draw on his back with a sharpie perm. marker (he didn&#039;t wake up).&nbsp; One of my brothers had broken down a door trying to break into a room to have a place to sleep, and another one (the one that drew on the other) was about as fucked up as I was.&nbsp; I DO have a 14 minute long video of all this happening I recorded on my phone, but have no idea how to share it with you all without giving away my anonymity :(<br /><br />Reflecting on what I just typed, you&#039;ve gotta read this story in the perspective of a guy drunk son of a fuck tripping shrooms trying to hide it from almost everybody to grasp how hilariously awful the situation really was. <br /><br />To sum it up, me and jessica about an hour after the sun came up (around 7-ish) decided to leave the shit hole frat and head back to her apartment, which she shared with her sister.&nbsp; Jessica tried to get her sister, but my bro was still balls deep in her so she declined to leave.&nbsp; The whole ride home I was just ready to pass out, and my shroom trip had mostly subsided.<br /><br />The next day I get a phone call from the president of my frat telling me that I have been suspended pending a hearing for possession of drugs as, while they were cleaning up, one of my bitch ass pledge brothers narqed on me and showed him a jacket I own that had a VERY small amount of dried p. cubbies in it.&nbsp; I was ultimately suspended for a total of 30 days, and stood with jessica the remainder of my winter break until school started back up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, It was one of those nights that is just summed up like being a fucking pledge-&quot;It&#039;s the most fun you&#039;ll never want to have again.&quot;<br /><br />Oh, and when I went back to my frat and found my sack in the hiding spot I left them-my 12 gram sack was reduced to 4 so I had ate approx. 10 grams total this night...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Some really good stories, so will share one of mine. <br /><br />After a football match (soccer to those from the US) a friend in the terrace invited me to a Halloween party. Had been drinking at the football so was pretty ok when a girl wanted to paint me up like a zombie. I got all painted up, then the guy I came with says &quot;Here, have this&quot; and handed me a shot. I slammed the shot and said &quot;That is some smooth vodka&quot;, &quot;No man, it was liquid acid&quot;.<br /><br />After about, actually I have no sense of time, so after a while I start trippin hard. I walk outside and just keep walking. Upon seeing a lamppost, I decided I should climb it. I climbed the lamppost pretty poorly and then noticed that I was outside the local police station. I had a rational thought and decided to call my gf for a pickup. I called, said I was on acid, told her to guess where I was and hung up. Calling, laughing and saying I was hiding from her went on for a while until I let slip where I was. This was around 3am.<br /><br />I only have a couple of buys on here so far, but I dont think she would like if I started ordering psychs. Seems every time I take some, I love it and go on some sort of adventure. She doesnt take it, so she doesnt find it so adventurous.<br />

				Last weekend my buddy and I decide that we would have one last shit show before shutting down for a while. We picked up 16 g blow and 2 g MDMA for the 2 of us. He also had some acid, but I did not partake in it. We went to this lakeside in the middle of nowhere with 15 other guys and go completely looped. I ate 1.5 gs of our MDMA ( it wasn&#039;t that good), and also&nbsp; a little over a gram of another buddies ( it was excellent). It want the first time I had bended like that, but it had been awhile. By the end of it, I had been awake for over 100 hours, and was experiencing some very interesting and sometimes disturbing visuals haha! The audio hallucinations where insane by the end of that bender. My brain hates me.

With 2.5 g molly and 8 grams fishscale it wasn&#039;t hard to stay awake&nbsp; :D. The first&nbsp; 24 hours was sober ( I work shift), the total time spent in bat country was 72 hours, but the time in total that my peepers were open definitely contributed to my audio/visual adventures.

				I originally intended to post a new thread about this story, but this was when it was still happening and I was high as balls. Anyways, it happened only a month ago.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered some MXE here and it always has been great. I&#039;ve had some funny experiences and I&#039;ve experienced a god-complex about 2-3 times. One time really thinking I was Jesus, here to enlighten all the stubborn people that don&#039;t know what in the world is going on. Other time I thought that when I would really marry a woman, it would be the perfect woman, so me and her combined would lead to our babies being gods, I&#039;ve tried to rationalize it but the result was always that the babies will be gods. But that&#039;s not the story I wanted to write... So here it goes<br /><br />I still (or again) live with my parents. There have been a couple of times when I intended to get high where I would take the drug of choice right before dinner, then have dinner with my family, go to my room and a few moments later I&#039;d be stoned. This has worked with both hash cookies and MXE. But on this particular day I&#039;ve thought to myself that I&#039;d rather take too much than too less since my last mxe trip was kinda mediocre. So I&#039;ve put a dose which I estimated to be 50-60 mg into my hand and consumed it. I don&#039;t have a scale so I always had to guess the right dosage. When it was in my mouth I kinda had the feeling that it was a little more than expected, but I didn&#039;t think too much of it. I went to dinner and it was fine. I felt the mood-lift kicking in so I started talking with my parents about several things. <br /><br />But then everything got out of control. The MXE kicked in, and it probably wasn&#039;t 50-60mg, but more likely 80-100 mg. I can&#039;t really say. I&#039;ve blacked out and my parents took me to the hospital. However I remember how my father put on my shoes and how the size of my mug was growing insanely huge. Then I remember sitting in a car and it really felt like I was having a dream. I don&#039;t have actual memories but rather sentiments from that moment. It felt like my life was like a loop or a pair of tracks and that I&#039;ve come across the same stations several times throughout my life. But it felt like everything was cycling in on this particular moment and I&#039;ve had the impression that my life, as if it was a movie, was finally coming to it&#039;s end. This end was kinda tragic but well deserved. A little site-note here, I&#039;m diagnosed with MDD and had some suicidal thoughts.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had so many scenes playing in my head which all led to the same point, the hospital, where I&#039;ve believed I&#039;d die. But I didn&#039;t, I wasn&#039;t even close to dieing, it was just this strange sensation that trip had given me. My parents told me that I had said that I could walk by myself, so they let go off me and I turned 360° and sat down (sounded kinda funny). I woke up in the hospital, still thinking it was some kind of a dream but thinks became more and more clear and I&#039;ve had to realize that his wasn&#039;t a dream and that I was in the hospital due to me being incautious. I wasn&#039;t really able to talk, but I&#039;ve somehow managed to say that I was on Methoxetamine. But that didn&#039;t matter since the doctors didn&#039;t know what it was. They&#039;ve run drug tests and everything was negative. They&#039;ve had assumed I&#039;d taken LSD and one doctor, who didn&#039;t know what she was doing, therefore declared that I&#039;m having hallucinations.&nbsp; I was still stoned on MXE, but I haven&#039;t had any hallucinations and I&#039;ve certainly not taken LSD.&nbsp; What the fuck.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve had to spent the night at the hospital but they let me go the next day. Right before I went I&#039;ve had a conversation with the chief of neurology of that hospital who actually knows what MXE is. The other doctors got their facts from Wikipedia. But he could tell me some stuff. He was wondering how I got it since it&#039;s kinda like the &quot;last resort to take for depression&quot;. He told me some facts that were also to be found on the internet, but he also said that it reduces the leukocytes, ergo weakening the immune system, which was new to me and interesting to know. The conversation was very interesting since there was this huge contrast of 10 doctors having no idea what mxe is and then him walking in coming up with facts like he&#039;s House. <br /><br />The story isn&#039;t really funny or fucked up, but my first clear thought in the hospital after waking up was that I&#039;ve fucked up. Personally I find the story interesting. I don&#039;t even regret it happening because it was a neat experience. By the way, my parents are cool with me taking drugs&nbsp; 8) They consider me smart enough to decide for myself what&#039;s the best.
