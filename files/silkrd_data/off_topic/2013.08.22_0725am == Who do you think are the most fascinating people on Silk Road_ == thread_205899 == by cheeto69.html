				Some of the people here are really just fascinating. The whole idea of internet drug lords is really interesting to me, and sometimes I feel like I enjoy the meta-game of Silk Road almost as much as I enjoy the drugs I get from it. There are a lot of vendors/administrators/users here who I think it would be super interesting to learn more about, but obviously we never will due to the nature of the business.<br /><br />In no particular order, here are some of the people I think are really interesting and would love to learn more about (but sadly will never be able to):<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts - does he have a family? What&#039;s his regular job? Where does he live? How has he run SR to outlive it&#039;s predecessors (e.g. Farmer&#039;s Market) so well? What goes on when SR goes down, and he comments that it&#039;s fixed but he can&#039;t mention why it was down?<br /><br />Tessellated - My top pick. I&#039;d be really interested in learning about LSD synthesis and the community behind it. Where the hell does he get LSD precursors, and how has he/his group gained the knowledge/materials necessary for LSD synthesis? Plus his new MDMA intrigues me. It&#039;s silver, unlike any MDMA I&#039;ve ever seen (I&#039;m currently staring at a gram of Tess&#039; MDMA on my desk) and he claims it&#039;s much more potent than other MDMA you may find (can&#039;t say myself whether this is true). Where does he get the connections for such good product? And in Canada of all places...<br /><br />jesusofrave - Where does he get so many drugs? How did he make himself such a big vendor so quickly?<br /><br />SuperTrips - Where the fuck does he get all those drugs from? I mean seriously, he probably mails out a metric shitload of drugs daily. My theory is that he/his organization must manufacture them, but the idea of creating so much drugs fascinates me as well.<br /><br />envious/Jannis - AL-LAD and LSZ? How the hell did they get their hands on that? I know they&#039;re sharing the same source, but where is this mystical lab manufacturing incredibly rare LSD analogues?<br /><br />StExo - Very highly respected on the SR forums, and I&#039;m very intrigued by his money laundering consultations. What does this guy do IRL?<br /><br />astor - Also very highly respected on the SR forums, and I&#039;m very curious what he does IRL to be able to give great security advice all the time.<br /><br />So, who do you guys think are the most interesting people on Silk Road that you wish you could learn more about?

				I want to know more about that livestr0ng guy! He seems like a really cool guy. How did he become so aweome?<br /><br />Jokes aside, I wonder the exact same shit. I&#039;d love to hear some of these people&#039;s came to be how they are and crazy, unique experiences. I want to know about people with close lab connections or who have their lab. I wan to hear how the big time stuff goes down and how they make the big bucks as well as all their tricks of the trade.

				it seems like you are trying to kiss peoples butts no offense. also you used he alot when some of these people might be women. <br />if people were to tell you there story they would probably lie anyway so as to not identify themselves.<br /><br />i suppose dpr might be interesting. but in situations like this the illusion is more interesting than the truth. think about Breaking Bad. People hear of this bad ass bomb making, meth cooking, hat wearing drug lord named Heisenberg. Who in reality is a middle aged old man in titey whities dying of cancer who loves his wife and kids. The illusion is more interesting.

				I wanna know how KKRoids has such amazing hookups.<br /><br />He sells on multiple clearnet forums and must have massive stockpiles of product, he&#039;s probably running the biggest steroid operation in Australia and he has connections with every major underground lab in Australia and many worldwide. How the fuck does he get so many roids in the country in their original packaging? No way is he doing it through the mail. He has his hands on pretty much every pharmaceutical product sold in bulk quantities and virtually every steroid in existence. How buff is he? He must be huge.<br /><br />Also, those European guys who source multiple kg&#039;s from real MDMA cooks. What I&#039;d pay to have those kinds of hookups, no-one in Australia has hookups like that, even the bikies are pressing shit pills with virtually no MDMA.

				I am very fond of SS.<br /><br />People like him are why I continue to have a sliver of hope. It is impossible to find someone who does not judge; or only give a shit about themselves. <br /><br />Too bad I have yet to find that outside of here, I have yet to find someone who is not an asshole who would fuck you over for next to nothing. <br />Does anyone ever actually take what you have to say to heart? They only do what society tells a &quot;loving&quot; person to do and say oh I am so sorry here is my shoulder to cry on. But deep down they don&#039;t give a shit. At least assholes who tell you straight up that they do not care about you or your problems are not being brainwashed fakers. <br /><br />Humans who actually give a shit about what is going in a &quot;friend&#039;s&quot; head/life are extinct. Fuck society, Fuck people.<br /><br />Cheers to SS.

				Ok ...I will admit it. I, like StExo&nbsp; do a bit of misinformation here and there myself as it is good practice since I&#039;m terrible at adjusting my writing styles constantly if I change nicknames or whatever, So when I decided to open my vendor account I got rid of my old forum nickname...I was Guru. <br /><br />But I think it is a little to obvious in hindsight.

				I wonder, especially with vendors whether Silk Road is just a job or a way of life. Some of the bigger ones especially, it must be all they think about and do.

				@Savlon, its a different story for each and every vendor. Some are full time SR grinders. Others are legit 9-5 citizens. Which ever way a vendor, or buyers story goes.. the ending is always the same. This place is a way of life ;)

				I am you Bruce. I am the anti-you.<br /><br />You act all smug, living in your Hollywood mansion. Well, Burn Notice sucked. <br /><br />Yes, I know who you really are. You even look down on us as you package up your Benzos. What is this -a hobby for you?<br /><br />I bet you didn&#039;t even read that screenplay I sent you.<br /><br />//This is my Boomstick

				OMG Partayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. I have a beach in mind. When I get tired of the online drug lord game and fancy trying to run a prison from the inside Ill arrange such a gathering. The coke will flow freely and bitches will wear nothing but glittery bikinis. <br /><br />Personally I think its fooooking impossible to run a large SR op 9 - 5, spesh considering the US time difference. You´r constantly on it, either packaging or customer servicing or snooping on here. I always thought starting out it would be a peice of piss, just waddle on the site and do a few packages. The reality is that its a way of life and not just a job <br /><br />ACE
