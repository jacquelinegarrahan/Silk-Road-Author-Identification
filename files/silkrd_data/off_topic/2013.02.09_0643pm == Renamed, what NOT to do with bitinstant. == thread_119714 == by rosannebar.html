				So I have always used the bitinstant, zipzap, walmart pay method.&nbsp; (deposited to blockchain)<br /><br />Last night I put in, lets say a shiny 500 bill.&nbsp; &nbsp; Got 466 bitcoins in my blockchain by the time I checked.&nbsp; &nbsp; Usually its there way before I get home.<br /><br />This morning, I did the exact same process,&nbsp; &nbsp;got home much later, lets say coming up on 2 hours now,&nbsp; &nbsp;and block-chain has not shown my deposit yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Still sitting at good old 466.<br /><br />I have a confirmation email like you generally get.&nbsp; &nbsp; But no coins yet.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; &nbsp; Not sure if I should contact bitinstant,&nbsp; &nbsp;or zip zap.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Grrrrr, always something, you know?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope its just a slight back up or something.

				It also says,&nbsp; &nbsp;*this website (blockchain.info)&nbsp; is asking to store data on your computer for offline use&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *allow, never for this site, not now* *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have no idea what that is,&nbsp; so I always just click no.<br /><br /><br />You Received<br /><br />20.85819 BTC ($ 280.23)<br /><br />Value at time of transaction $ 467.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; &nbsp; this is a copy paste of what it says on last nights thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep in mind,&nbsp; &nbsp;every other time I log on, it has 460, or 480.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly if somehow I lost the 500 I put in a couple hours ago, I will never use SR again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For someone that scrapes by and saves to make a purchase,&nbsp; to simply lose it,&nbsp; would deflate me like a balloon.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s just a slow day or something.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone have this exp before?

				I am right at the 4 hour mark now. <br /><br />Trying to play it cool.&nbsp; &nbsp; But when you have a wish list,&nbsp; finally get the coin to get it,&nbsp; &nbsp;and a huge chunk of your coins stop to visit the moon before they show up,&nbsp; you tend to worry :/<br /><br />Seriously tho,&nbsp; guess I will wait and see how it goes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is to hoping.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for the replies.

				Well, did you use any of the same info on the 2nd transaction as you had on the 1st?&nbsp; Same email address?&nbsp; Same bitcoin deposit address?&nbsp; Same name?&nbsp; Same birthdate?&nbsp; Exact same amount?&nbsp; If so, the 2nd transaction was caught by the fraud filter at bitinstant because the system thinks it is an accidental duplicate transaction.<br /><br />Contact bitinstant support and they will have to push it through manually for you.

				I never thought of that.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was an exact same amount, same info,&nbsp; however there was a day in between. and the other coins had already deposited yesterday, confirmed and all that junk.<br /><br />I contacted support, have not heard back from them,&nbsp; but thanks for that idea.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sounds reasonable.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				You said &quot;last night&quot; and then &quot;this morning&quot; -- so I assumed there was NOT a day in between.&nbsp; Did I read that wrong?&nbsp; It&#039;s basically anything within a 24 hour period ... so your first deposit &quot;last night&quot; started the 24 hour period ... which means if you then made another deposit &quot;this morning,&quot; that would still be within the same/initial 24 hour period.<br /><br />I only know this because back when I used to buy bitcoins that way, I had that problem a few times.&nbsp; Annoying as shit because it happened even when I used a different bitcoin address and different amount.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, keep bothering bitinstant support until they push your transaction.&nbsp; This is an issue on their end and they claim that they will refund you their &quot;fee&quot; if the mistake is on their part (and it is).&nbsp; However, they won&#039;t refund the fee unless you specifically ask --- seems they like to get away with what they can sometimes.&nbsp;

				Yeah SCOUT your right.&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#039;t a full 24 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; More like 19 hours or something.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have sent them 2 emails so far, going for a 3rd.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have yet to hear back.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The damn confusing part is the confirmation emails.&nbsp; &nbsp;First from bit instant then from zip zap.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You would think if it hung up with a fraud alert they wouldn&#039;t send that all good email out.<br /><br />Well,&nbsp; &nbsp;here I go.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am predicting a long weekend of trying to fix it and having no luck.

				Did you check blockchain.info with your btc address to make sure they didn&#039;t send the second one?&nbsp; I think it gets stuck in Bitinstant&#039;s system sometime AFTER the zipzap stuff.&nbsp; It goes through Moneygram/ZipZap just fine, and then gets caught by the fraud filter in bitinstant&#039;s system.&nbsp;

				You called it scout.<br /><br />Support from bitinstant got back to me.&nbsp; &nbsp; Said,&nbsp; &nbsp;* will forward to tech support, will take one business days to do manual transfer *<br /><br />To which I replied,&nbsp; so your basically telling me, I will spend all day monday waiting for them to do this, and possibly have my funds on Tuesday.<br /><br />He said,&nbsp; &nbsp;* in the future stagger the amounts by 50 or so, to avoid it getting caught up like this *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />So frustrating.&nbsp; &nbsp; But that is what it was,&nbsp; &nbsp;to of the same amounts in 2 short of a time period.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A disclaimer or some type of warning would be nice on bitinstant.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Really stole my thunder, but live and learn I suppose.

				Bullshit though because it&#039;s happened several times even when the amounts are different.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; <br /><br />They should be pushing it through for you IMMEDIATELY ... they usually do that for people as soon as they realize what happened.&nbsp; After all, they have your money, you don&#039;t have the coins, and who knows how the market will fluctuate.<br /><br />Did they at least offer to reimburse you their 4% fee?&nbsp; They should since they advertise that they will when the error is their fault.
