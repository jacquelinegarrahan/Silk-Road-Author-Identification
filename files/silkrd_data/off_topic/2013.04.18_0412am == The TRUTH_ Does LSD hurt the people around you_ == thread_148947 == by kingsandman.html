				First off, let me say that this is not a thread bashing LSD at -ALL-. <br />LSD is the ONLY substance that I partake in doing, and it is through my occasional LSD use that I have stopped all other substances, aside from the occasional xanax, and alcohol, which I will do once a month, if that.<br /><br />LSD has helped me realize some patterns that life throws at me, and unfortunately there is a pattern that I have noticed that makes me contemplate quitting LSD aswell. That pattern is, that within the first 36 hours after a trip is over, something bad happens to someone that is in my immediate circle of loved ones in my life. <br /><br />The degree of &quot;bad&quot; is always different, but it can involve injuries, it can involve making very bad choices, and also being caught doing things that they have been doing for years. And this is a recurring pattern, everytime I take LSD, within 36 hours I know something is going to happen to someone close to me. <br /><br />This might seem silly, but I am reaching out anonymously, for honest opinions about this experience. Some will call me nuts, some will relate. Trolls are expected. I know LSD has helped you all, but have you ever associated it with harm?<br /><br />Thanks for reading, hope to hear some honest answers.

				In order to consider if that&#039;s true, you&#039;ll need to tell us examples, or at least tell us if these &#039;bad&#039; things are results of your LSD use with any reason other than their temporal proximity. The title question is interesting though, often a real indicator of &#039;addiction&#039; is not the effect of the substance on the user so much as the use on the user&#039;s relationships. I think the answer to that question would be no, LSD does not categorically hurt the people around you, but just like anything that can be abused, there are situational exceptions. <br /><br />Edit: Yes i&#039;m fun at parties

				One thing I think psychedelics can do is cause strange or coincidental things that happen to us during our indulgence is to make us feel like they are directly caused from our using. How true that may be I&#039;m not for sure it&#039;s just my theory. There has been some strange or coincidences that has been happening to me lately and it&#039;s kind of been freaking me out and sometimes I wonder if there is a deeper spiritually connecting reason between the use of certain molecules and the following events that happens in a person&#039;s life after.

				I think you stated the obvious in your OP..&nbsp; LSD makes you very aware of patterns.. In life, in nature in your bathroom floor! What ever the case might be.. You just happen to be more aware of your surrounding and the people around you in that time frame and you ahve started to expect something to happen looking for that patter to continue..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;In reality I can say the same thing for the new or full moon.. Every time Mercury is in retrograde ect... ( Tho Mercury really does mess with me and my life goes haywire every time.. Things start going wrong and I go check the cycle and its always gone into retrograde.. LOL)&nbsp; But you get the drift.. <br /><br />&nbsp;Over all you are just &quot;more awake&quot; to the world and notice things a bit more that you might over look or not try and make a pattern out of if you had not just tripped.. They are unrelated dear..

				I don&#039;t know how long this occurrence has been going on but if its somewhat new maybe give it one more try. If nothing bad happens, cautiously continue use. If something bad happens try to quit or use another drug maybe. I don&#039;t believe your LSD use is &quot;cursed&quot; but that certainly is a series of crazy coincidences so why continue if its a drug you have a bad history with? I understand your just looking for thoughts and opinions of others but in the end, I think its up to you to decide. <br />+1 for reaching out how you did

				I believe there is actually evidence that demonstrates LSD specifically causes coincidental occurrences to seem to carry greater significance.&nbsp;

				I think me doing acid actually has a good effect on people around me.<br />I have become more open minded and outgoing and people pick up on the vibes. <br /><br />But i have had similar experiences like you. A change of reality after every use.<br />Its like changing channels on the TV.&nbsp; Next one- next one -next one just skipping from one to another. <br />This one that Im in right now is shit. The vibes are strange. <br />The moment i climbed out of my last trip i just knew i had to trip again. <br />

				I appreciate the replies everyone, +thanks to you all for your input and reflections!<br /><br />NewStem: The main reason I didn&#039;t go into detail was to remain anonymous.. but I guess a little detail wouldn&#039;t hurt. This past time I tripped, I learned that about the time I was getting to sleep, my mother was getting into an argument with her boyfriend, and he decided to choke her and punch her in the face during this argument. Since then, it has been a recurring issue, and she is now in the process of moving out of their home. About 12 hours after the previous trip, my other half, who is a lifeguard, passed out on her stand, fell all the way down and hit the back of her neck on the edge of the pool, and fell in unconscious. It hadn&#039;t happened to her before, and hasn&#039;t happened again since then. And almost a full day after my trip before that one, my dad was involved in his first motorcycle wreck. He has been into bikes since I was a little one, He was forced to jump off of his bike at about 40mph, and land in the grass, where he fractured his leg, and broke his ankle. If he wouldnt have jumped, he probably would have died. <br /><br />Sensei: I totally see where you are coming from. That&#039;s kind of what I&#039;m investigating here.. and the only way to find a true answer is to ask a bunch of people who use psychedelics too. LSD is a very powerful substance, and maybe I&#039;m not using it in the right way.. maybe there is no right way to use it. The way I look at it right now is, by being family, or even being friends, we are emotionally connected. We have memories, and maybe when I take this molecule, those memories become a bit scrambled, not permenantly, but maybe a small detail changes in my mind. Kind of like the movie &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, he goes back in time to change one thing, and it causes violent changes to that person&#039;s world. <br /><br />livestr0ng: I&#039;m with you man, in the end it is totally up to me. And the reason I posted this thread is actually because I was contemplating tripping again, but I was afraid there was going to be another consequence. I have 10 of Tessellated&#039;s blotters sitting right next to me, untouched and waiting to be explored. I seek guidance from those who have also seen the light :)<br /><br />AbsintheKitten: Maybe I am associating apples with oranges.. that&#039;s what I&#039;m here to find out.. but I totally feel you on the full moon, and mercury retrograde.. I&#039;m a huge fan of astrology, and mercury retrograde can fuck a bunch of shit up.. I actually used to warn people on other private sites when it was mercury retrograde, because orders would have a higher probability of getting mixed up! LOL but yes, I am more aware of the world thanks to Lucy and I see the world in so many different ways now, it&#039;s still hard to make a message out of everything..<br /><br />kmfkewm: Forgive me,&nbsp; but I can&#039;t tell if you were being saracastic or not.. can you maybe elaborate a little bit? Interested to hear about what you have to say!<br /><br />valakki: There has definitely been times where I took LSD and felt like a fucking rockstar for awhile afterwards. I&#039;m definitely more open minded, and I think about the world in ways that I never have before I took LSD. And as far as the changing channels and skipping chapters in your life.. The Butterfly Effect, man! lol.. read what I said to Sensei! <br /><br /><br /><br />

				anonman88 summed it up pretty well. your thoughts manifest into reality... so if you think &quot;bad&quot; things are going to happen, they probably will! it&#039;s the law of attraction at work.

				I feel like it might be an exercise in futility to try and change you mind. I&#039;m sure you have felt that these event may be related to your lsd use.&nbsp; I have only used lsd once, had a good time and went on with my life. No one likes to feel powerless in scary situations and the situations you describe sound as scary as they get, loved ones being hurt. I&#039;ll try to give you my thoughts on what you had happen even though I don&#039;t expect to change your mind.<br /><br />It is not you fault or even your mothers that she has a physically abusive boyfriend. It is a incredibly difficult situation, I know, I wittinessed more than my share of domestic and sexual violence in the household growing up. It sucks and no one wants to feel helpless, but you need to know that your mother&#039;s boyfriend abusing her is not your fault and there is nothing you can do other than to encourage their separation or legal action if warranted. I really hope they separate, choking and hitting are very serious and that can escalate past that.<br /><br />It seems that falling off of a lifeguarding platform is a risk of the job. You are sitting out in the sun for hours, it seems reasonable to consider that you could doze off and lose your balance or be overcome with heat stroke. I hate to be blunt but accidents happen.<br /><br />Lastly your father, I know many people who ride motorcycles. People that have been riding for any number of year, from a few to decades. From my experience, a great number of them have crashed, or put their bikes down for a multitude of different reasons, it can happen to the best of riders. Riding a motorcycle is dangerous. Crashes happen and there isn&#039;t much to protect you. I don&#039;t know of any way to link lsd use with another persons motorcycle crash. I can only think that the effects of lsd make it feel that you are to blame. It is not uncommon in other situations to feel guilt when someone we care for is hurt. We wonder why couldn&#039;t we help them? It sucks to think how many things we have no control over and we like to find ways to believe that we do have control. Even people not using lsd will find ways to blame themselves when bad things happen to loved ones.<br /><br />As for future use, that is 100% your call. Just trust your instincts and stay safe.
