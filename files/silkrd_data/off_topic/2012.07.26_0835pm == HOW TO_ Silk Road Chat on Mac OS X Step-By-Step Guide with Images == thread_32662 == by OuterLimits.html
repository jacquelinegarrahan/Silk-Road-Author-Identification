				For all the Mac OS X users, I have created a very detailed step-by-step guide that includes screenshots for every step on how to configure Adium to connect to the Silk Road IRC chat through Tor.<br /><br />Adium is basically the Mac version of Pidgin, it uses the same core &quot;libpurple&quot; that Pidgin uses for most protocols. This guide also covers how to configure the Tor Browser Bundle for Mac to use the same SOCKS port everytime you launch it instead of a random port, so that you only have to setup this configuration one time.<br /><br />Check it out:<br /><br />http://x35jfacrznhhtrfr.onion/tutorials/mac/chat/

				Is it set up to where the Mac users stay completely anonymous?<br /><br />I remember reading the other day about how Pidgin in Windows used a real tag from your computer.. so it pretty much gave away who you were. Idk that much about what&nbsp; I am talking about but I do know I read something like that.. somewhere on here. :P
