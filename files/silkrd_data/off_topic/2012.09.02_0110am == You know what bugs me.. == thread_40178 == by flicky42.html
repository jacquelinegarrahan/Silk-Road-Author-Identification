				When I&#039;m meeting people or hanging out with someone at a bar and I ask if they smoke. I usually have weed on me so I figure hey I&#039;ll smoke this person up to be nice and hang out. Too often I get the response &quot;no, but I do get drunk as fuck&quot; or some variation of it. I&#039;m not flexing my arms in a drug contest when I ask that. Maybe I&#039;m reading that response wrong but I&#039;ve heard it quite a few times and it confuses me.

				This just reminded me of a situation a few years back. I was at a concert with my mother (that&#039;s right I went with my mom) and we were near center stage in the lawn of an outdoor venue. Now my mother smoked pot when she was younger but left it behind for the same reason I did (severe paranoia...btw, thanks for that mom) but she does chain smoke Marlboros. There was a group of younger guys huddled near us. One of them walked up to my mother and asked if she smoked. Instinctively she told him that she did. I began to crack a smile because I knew she misunderstood. The guy asked if he could use her lighter. Still seems like this could be a cigarette situation to my mother. She happily gets her lighter from her pocket and hands it to the guy. Now for the funny part. He pulled out a VERY large hookah and before she knew what was going on, she had a lung full of righteous bud smoke. Her face was a funny as I have ever seen while she was trying to explain to him that yes she smokes, but she doesn&#039;t SMOKE....not that she has anything wrong with you people...I mean potheads...that smoke drugs...I&#039;m really not trying to offend you, but you are...I mean I didn&#039;t... whats going on,&nbsp; My son will explain it, I have to go.&nbsp; I have never laughed so hard at her reaction, and she did leave the concert in a fucking hurry, and locked herself in the car paranoid as anyone I have ever met.<br /><br />I know it doesn&#039;t really go along with your point, but it was the first thing to come to mind when I read your post.

For someone unsuspecting having a giant hookah pulled out of you is overwhelming and hilarious. But who the hell smokes weed out of a hookah at a concert? That&#039;s just begging to get caught, you can&#039;t dispose of the evidence.
