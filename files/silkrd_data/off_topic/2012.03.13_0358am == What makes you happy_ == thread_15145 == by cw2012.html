				Whether it be drugs, women, sports, working hard, working out, anything..<br /><br />It was just something I was thinking about and was curious as to what others might say here.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d have to say doing well at work, women, and working out would be up there on my list along with experimenting with drugs from time to time.

				I am reminded by an old 5Th Ward Boys track- PWA with Devin signing the hook. <br /><br />&quot;Pussy, weed and alcohol, it seems to satisfy us all&quot;...... Truer words have never been spoken.

				Being alive. I don&#039;t judge others for their desires, but I feel like when anyone lists some materialistic things and say it makes them happy, you really don&#039;t know what makes you happy. I thought the same thing in my young life when I tasted loads of money, and then it was gone, like that. And I realized that it didn&#039;t bring me happiness, because I was a shell; completely empty. Money comes and goes. If it&#039;s gone, I can still be optimistic in my life.<br /><br />Women I guess to an extent, but more so someone I can share a truly divine connection with. In this society, we seem to have forgotten what &#039;Love&#039; really is. There is no Love in this society, only lust and superficiality. If Sex simply made us happy, then there would be no need for Love.

				Relative freedom. And the means to circumvent certain restrictions on that freedom. To some extent, my work also provides some happiness (In a way, I make peoples&#039; lives easier and more enjoyable/comfortable by solving their problems with my very specific expertise.) I have a clean conscience when I rest my head at night, even being the dirty junky/meth head/fiend that our civilized society insists that I am.<br /><br />Never was much for happiness through materialistic gain, though I wouldn&#039;t judge others for being so.<br />

				fixing a bug when I am trying to configure a server or write a program or what not. Its the most fun text based game in the world. Bug slayer!!!! Always get a nice rush when the problem is fixed, particularly if it is one that takes a few hours and makes me want to punch a wall or something. <br /><br />Being dissociated away from reality is also fun times, gotta love ketamine. Of course it is also nice to see reality in super high definition and with limitless abstraction. Really anything that involves me not having baseline perceptions makes me happy. Sober perceptions are the worst sort of prison , I feel sorry for the people who live entirely contained by them.

				Doing good in school - Working out - Working - Meditating - Family - Girls - Lastly drugs<br /><br />I try my damndest to not depend on drugs to make me happy. They are like a nice bonus but ultimately if all the drugs in the world disappeared tomorrow I would still be one happy motherfucker
