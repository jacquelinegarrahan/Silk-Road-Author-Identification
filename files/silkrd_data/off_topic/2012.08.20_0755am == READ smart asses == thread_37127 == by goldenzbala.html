				Visit some firearm enthusiast forums. They have classified sections. It is still legal in the USA to meet someone face to face and privately purchase a firearm with no ID. Don&#039;t forget a thousand rounds or two to go with it.<br /><br />What are you thinking of getting?

				Wow what a good business dialogue you&#039;ve got there.<br /><br />I will MOST DEFINITELY look into this for you because I love being called a smart ass for no reason and then being threatened that the buyer (you) is above the rest of us and can &#039;detect&#039; scammers.&nbsp; Ccan you send me the blueprints to your scammer detection device?<br /><br />A better way of approaching this may have been gone like this <br /><br />&quot;Since the Armory has been closed, are there any vendors who were forced to shut down their operations there around with a robust selection of weapons?&nbsp; Please PM me your public key because I would like to discuss which weapons you have available and which I ones I am looking for.&nbsp; I am also concerned about security so could you let me know some people on here who can vouce for you?<br /><br />Thanks Guys,<br /><br />&lt;NotDouchebagVersion&gt;goldenzbala<br />&quot;<br /><br />

This has been something fear mongers and arms dealers have pushed for the entire history of our Nation. For fuck sakes, we have had SEVERAL presidents shot. Kennedy and Reagan to name a few. Did we ban guns back then? No. The right of Americans to keep and bear arms is enshrined in our constitution. Changing that would take more than an act of congress. I understand you have not been through a constitutional amendment process in your lifetime being as you are so young, but it is not something that just happens. Take some time and read here:<br /><br />***CLEARNET***<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution<br />***CLEARNET***<br /><br />Keep in mind when you are reading your right wing emails or websites that these folks tend to have an agenda, not only to push up the price of the weapons they are selling, but to keep them selling in as high volumes as they can. They have tried and true methods of scaring people into thinking guns will become illegal so they keep the market working in their favor. Good luck to you and I wish you well in obtaining a weapon legally when you are of age and have matured enough to own it safely. <br /><br />What is it a boy of your age needs a gun for anyway? &quot;They&#039;re gonna make em illegal.&quot; isn&#039;t a reason to own one particularly as even if they were illegal there would be a black market for them. Am I wrong?

It isnt a historical sovereign country. <br /><br />If Zionism decided England or the US was their homeland, invaded tommorow and threw everyone out of their houses and put in illegal Zionist squatters from Europe, Russia the US etc to take the land and houses they have been in for generations like they have to the Palestinians and the Lebanese in South Lebanon, would that be ok? Just because their man in the sky said it is? <br /><br />History doesnt lie, historical revisionists like Zionists and the religious do though but their lumpen&nbsp; :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />fuck that.&nbsp; there have been jews living in what is now modern day israel for centuries, they didn&#039;t just &quot;randomly decide&quot; that it was their homeland.&nbsp; no matter where the jews have gone throughout history, people have been nothing but hateful and suspicious towards them.&nbsp; well, this is the time when the jews say &quot;No More!&quot; and &quot;Fuck you all.&quot;&nbsp; If you want to exterminate us this time, you&#039;ll have to go through all our guns and tanks, cuz its been proven that non-violent resistance is useless against the christian/muslim majority that wants us all dead.&nbsp; we don&#039;t want to fight, we just want to live....but there are far too many people like yourself who don&#039;t want us to live.&nbsp; so we fight.
