				Hi<br /><br />well iam vending now for longtime. ups and downs .<br /><br />but now i think if i do it full time i can make a good living of it and customer service will be better and shipping faster ect ect.<br /><br />now i got a fulltime job and do the vending part time . but being a vendor is a full time job so 2 full time jobs is fuckin hard if you all do it alone. so my idea was starting a company or something to launder the money. but i need some help by other vendors or ppl that do it to.<br /><br />so they got a company/store for paying taxes ect ect .<br /><br />cause if i stop my job and get a lot of money in the bank every month without a job i strange for ppl around me and things like that,<br /><br /><br />PM ME or MSG me on SR if you got real good tips. <br /><br />iam located in the netherlands

				your best bet would be to open up a bitcoin exchange company, obviously your contrys rules would be different, but in canada as long as your under 5k there is very little documentation required interms of anti money laundering.. this way you can open up bank accounts in the companies name and cash your btc&#039;s out using that bank info and then wahhalla you only pay tax on the profit you make as you will be sending money to your clients. very cheap way to cash out.. but getting that company made and all the small details is what you would have to pay someone from your area to do.
