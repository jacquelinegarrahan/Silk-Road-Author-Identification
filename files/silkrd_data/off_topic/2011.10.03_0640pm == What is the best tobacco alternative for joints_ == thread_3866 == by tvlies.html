				I used to be a smoker so I don&#039;t want to get hooked again. I&#039;ve read that dried lettuce is good??<br /><br />Those smoking mixes look nasty and half off them contain stuff like eucalyptus which I would&#039;ve thought would mask the taste of weed.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that you can soak tobacco in water for a few days to remove some of the bad stuff, I&#039;m leaning towards this atm.

				Damiana, catnip and spearmint leaves. I used to roll that up with some really bad weed and the herbs made it taste good and the shitty weed still got me high. Much better than tobacco as long as the mint leaves aren&#039;t old and crusty.

Apparently dried lettuce (not even wild lettuce) is supposed to be very similar to tobacco when dried out in the oven. I want something with the qualities of tobacco that will control the speed at which the joint burns. Weed burns too quickly.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3866.msg32696#msg32696">Quote from: vanilla on October 04, 2011, 04:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Damiana, catnip and spearmint leaves.

And spearmint, again, if I would&#039;ve thought that that would mask the flavour of the weed. That&#039;s not something that I want to happen when I&#039;m paying money for premium bud.

				Damiana is quite wonderful is you find a good source. Taste great, smokes very smooth. <br />@Moksha - you must have had a terrible source. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				While making spliffs, try grinding the weed well, pack the mixture while rolling, and only use a little tobacco (1 cigarette-&gt;3 spliffs).<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Nah just catnip with the spearmint leaves gave it a nice flavor and the damiana made it smooth. If you have good weed then maybe just the damiana. I still like the flavor of the spearmint with weed tho. It doesn&#039;t overpower it just gives a hint of minty flavor.

				I&#039;m putting my vote towards catnip as well. It burns and smokes smoothly, has a pleasing taste and scent, and it&#039;s own mild effects that complement weed nicely. Just make sure to buy organic bud catnip, not the pre-ground stuff, and remember to remove the seeds as they burn harshly.
