				Yep, nothing better than that.<br /><br />I bet you guys know the feeling of listening to a song sober for the first time ever and you get the chills..<br />thanks drugs and SR for giving me that emotion again and again :) <br /><br /><br />Anyways, what music are you guys listening/raving/chilling to when&nbsp; you&#039;re high on ---?<br /><br />my favourite so far:<br />LSD + dubstep = it blew my fucking mind <br />never heard a more intense bass, every fucking ear drum hair was vibrating ( i used in-ears).

				I&#039;m really enjoying listening to music on MXE/K right now. I make an epic 2-3 hour play list in iTunes and sit back and enjoy the ride. <br /><br />What&#039;s different than being sober is that I tend to mix up a lot of genres. So I might have a dubstep song, followed by classic rock, and then a classical song. Drugs can make everything sound great together.&nbsp; :P

				Music is a passion of mine...&nbsp; both listenin&#039; and playin&#039;.<br /><br />My first LSD trip involved a lot of Pink Floyd.&nbsp; Many a Grateful Dead show on acid followed over the years.<br /><br />My musical tastes are all over the map.&nbsp; I could list about a gazillion bands that go well with one drug or another.<br /><br />But I should point out that music doesn&#039;t need drugs anymore than drugs need music.&nbsp; They both stand on their own.<br /><br />- Bit

				Well, as we all know, Dubstep is the frequency of god when you&#039;re on Ketamine. Generally though I just smoke weed, and play around with various opiates. I absolutely love shit like Jungle, Breakcore, Raggacore after (and before) a couple bowls. Anything with a complex, chopped breakbeat to get the mind racing. When you&#039;re on a nice Sativa, artists like Venetian Snares just blow your mind; there is so much going on, it&#039;s incredibly layered and complex.

				i am a big fan of both music and drugs independent of each other, but together they enhance one another and can make for some incredible memories.<br /><br />my fav drugs are psychedelics with acid being my absolute fav.&nbsp; my fav music to listen to on acid is pink floyd (that&#039;s a given), jimi hendrix, lynyrd skynyrd, the beatles (my all time fav band), etc.&nbsp; i listen to music a lot on mushrooms too.&nbsp; i enjoy smoking weed when i can (my job does random drug tests, boo!) and when i do i like to listen to pretty much anything.&nbsp; i like everything from james brown to hank williams sr.<br /><br />i remember tripping on acid at a park with my then gf and we had a beatles mix cd playing.&nbsp; &quot;i want you (she&#039;s so heavy)&quot; came on and i remember thinking, &quot;wow!&nbsp; this has got to be the heaviest song i&#039;ve ever heard!&quot;&nbsp; of course, it isn&#039;t the heaviest if you are talking about metal or whatever, but to me it&#039;s still the most acid oriented song i know of.&nbsp; &quot;across the universe&quot; is my fav song ever, esp. after hearing it on acid; it&#039;s just so beautiful.&nbsp; lastly, &quot;i&#039;m only sleeping&quot; is a wonderful song that i think was written either on or strongly influenced by acid.

				Music + Drugs + Girls = Perfection.<br /><br />However, sometimes I just like to get high on my lonesome and enjoy the delights of a substance such as LSD or 2CB with some tripped out psychedelic trance or mellow pink floyd.

The actor reassured Harrison when he started having a bad trip, telling him: &quot;I know what it&#039;s like to be dead&quot; - a reference to a shooting accident when Fonda was 10.&quot;

				LSD + Music = Bliss. On my first trip I started to get a little paranoid at times, but blocking out the rest of the world with earphones helped a lot to keep me calm, especially as I was in a busy place full of strangers for more than a few minutes.<br /><br />As for what kind of music, Tool, The Kills, The Cranberries, and Dubstep in general are bloody great when I&#039;m high.

Music always can always put me back in the right place on psychedelics. Tool is great, I also enjoyed Puscifer quite a bit. <br /><br />+1 more on the Beatles.<br /><br />All time favorite is the original N64 Donkey Kong soundtrack. Fantastic with a batch of shrooms and will likely be put into my DMT playlist that&#039;ll be in the coming days.
