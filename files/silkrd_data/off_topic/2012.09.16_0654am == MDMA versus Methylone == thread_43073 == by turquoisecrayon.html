				Can those of you with experience with these substances try to answer these questions:<br /><br />* Which substance produces greater compassion in you?<br /><br />* Which substance is more compatible with meditation and visualization?<br /><br />* Which substance is better for retaining insights and attitudes found during the experience into everyday life?

				MDMA by far to all 3 questions. I had a solo session with MDMA and it is way up there in my most spiritual experiences along with LSD and mushrooms. Yes, I did meditate, theorized about the universe and my personal life.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tried speed, but that&#039;s what I imagine methylone to feel like (somewhat). I did really stupid stuff on it.

				I&#039;m a big fan of methylone, but good MDMA is hard to beat. I would go as far as saying it was the king of highs. It beats heroin for me...even beats good coke.

				Hmm.. &#039;MDMA Vs Methylone&#039;? To me they&#039;re completely different drugs - Both with their own magic. Methylone is like a weaker version of MDMA, with more stimulation and its own unique magic.<br /><br />MDMA gives me more empathy and peace with the world than Methylone.<br /><br />MDMA gives me more music appreciation (Though M1 does give me a lot of music appreciation as well)<br /><br />Methylone is more stimulating IMO.<br /><br />MDMA has a longer duration than M1<br /><br />Methylone gives me a better after glow... For up to 3 days after the experience my mood is noticeably improved.<br /><br />MDMA is more relaxing, and overall a better experience for me. However,<br /><br />Methylone has it&#039;s own unique magic, I call it &#039;Awakening of the soul&#039; the only way to describe it is that I feel my soul has been given Methamphetamine, and something I lost as a kid returned.<br /><br />Methylone gave me a stronger rush, though I did take a high dose.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my trip report for M1<br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24922.msg264758#msg264758

				As someone who likes clean press&#039;s I will say mdma or nothing. Methylone is a garbage drug imo its like mephedrone blown out of proportion, MDMA has this feeling that just sweeps you off your feet and you feel lite.
