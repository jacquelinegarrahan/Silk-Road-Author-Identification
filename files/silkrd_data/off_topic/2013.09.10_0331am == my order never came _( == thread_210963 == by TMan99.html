				I made an order for a pretty small amount of weed two weeks ago and was expecting it at latest a day or 2 before the memorial day weekend. I got in contact with the vendor on thursday but he has not been very helpful. Saying he was &quot;looking into it&quot; with no more updates even after I pmed him on 2 other occasions for updates. I am going to open a &quot;resolve&quot; tomorrow if I am still being ignored, it is a top 20% vendor with a 5.0 rating, :(<br /><br />This is terrible, I have one pill left of a daily med that I use and have not been able to order it because of the uncertainty of this dissapointing small order. I have no fucking clue how I am going to be able to function without it now with my daily schedule.<br /><br />On top of this I am thinking I was scammed for something else legal I bought on clearnet for $300, as the tracking that guy gave me is not showing up. :( That is premature guess though.<br /><br />If my SR order got confinscated it is so small they won&#039;t bother going after me, but I am in terror I won&#039;t be able to order from SR anymore because everything was under a real address. This will really fuck me and my health, I will be screwed and will have to go on the street for drugs that are watered down so fucking much that it is probably not even worth it. (I don&#039;t see the plus in ordering to drops, hopefully that does not become my only option)<br /><br />I really don&#039;t want to rely on a MD to get drugs that won&#039;t help me as much as what I get here.<br /><br />Has this happened to anyone else? What ended up happening and if it was confinscated what will I be able to do to get my drugs, I figure I would get a letter soon.<br /><br />Sorry, this is just me venting :(

				I cant think of any drug you can get from a MD that you can get here that would be as expensive or quality <br /><br />Please try and remember that postal services loose things not everything is confiscated

I would have to get different drugs from a MD, the drugs I get here are superior for me and illegal. <br /><br />Fuck, I am so overreacting just because I was on a comedown and nervous as hell of running out. Oh Well.

				Just speculating, but I don&#039;t think you need any drugs you can order off of SR for the goodness of your health.&nbsp; Just listen to yourself.

				I just received a USPS priority letter that took over 30 days to deliver.&nbsp; It was crumpled up, dirty, and looked like it had been through hell when I finally received it.&nbsp; It probably had gotten stuck in a USPS sorting machine and after a month they finally noticed it there, extracted it, and delivered it like it was any other piece of mail.&nbsp; During this whole 30+ days the vendor that sent this letter to me was on vacation and slow to respond, and I was pretty convinced I was scammed.&nbsp; But then I checked the mail today and there it was after all this time.&nbsp; So, 2 weeks, that&#039;s nothing compared to a month+.&nbsp; It&#039;s rare, but the mail can be _really_ slow.
