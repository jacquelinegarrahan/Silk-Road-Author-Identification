				I don&#039;t really understand why homosexuals lament AIDS. You don&#039;t meet junkies who act shocked when their friends hit the floor. You don&#039;t run into multiple felons who think it&#039;s an outrage that they&#039;ll likely die by the sword. Part of the point/thrill of pursuing homosexuality is that it&#039;s basically dangerous and nihilistic. AIDS lamentations are kind of at odds with the whole thing. <br /><br />I never figured out why we&#039;re supposed to feel bad for homosexuals who contract AIDS. It&#039;s like feeling bad for drunks who experience liver failure. People pay the piper.

				whoa....can....worms....everywhere!!!<br /><br />I watched a documentary (I think recommended off here) that was about homosexuals hosting parties to catch aids, now I would imagine this is a severe extreme case and not every homosexual is out banging fellas every night bareback at the risk of catching aids. <br /><br />Alot of homosexuals might have unprotected sex but then again so do heterosexuals. <br /><br />What&#039;s the difference?

				Everyone has little secrets about themselves.&nbsp; Some are more outgoing about it.&nbsp; We are all people regardless and it&#039;s just something that&#039;s easier to spread as homosexuals.&nbsp; Heterosexuals still have aids, and can spread it just as easily to females, and vice versa.&nbsp; We&#039;ve all got opinions and you&#039;ve just got to learn that in the end, if you let other people influence you about your decisions, you have spent too much time being obsessed with what people think.&nbsp; You&#039;ll only have yourself and you must make yourself happy.&nbsp;

				...because it&#039;s not fucking fair?<br />Look, both homosexuals and heterosexuals make mistakes, have unprotected sex, just-don&#039;t-use-a-condom-this-once, but the homosexual is more likely to be infected IF his partner is HIV-positive - this also goes for accidents, for example a condom breaking.<br />You can&#039;t compare homosexuals to junkies, or drunks, or felons. At the most basic level, you have a choice not to be a junkie (don&#039;t ever take heroin) or a drunk (don&#039;t ever drink alcohol) or a felon (don&#039;t ever commit crime). Homosexuality is not a choice, it is something you are born with in the same way that heterosexuality is, and for that you are &#039;punished&#039; with an increased risk of AIDS. <br />I feel bad for homosexuals that die of AIDS in the same way that I feel bad for a very white person who gets skin cancer - yes they SHOULD have been more careful because of their increased risk, but it&#039;s not their fault that they have that risk!

				I like how in the new Liberace movie they cast a man in his 40s to play the underage catamite. I guess when Priests prey on teens its &#039;&#039;pedophilia&#039;&#039;, but when Hollywood homosexuals do it its all good clean fun <br /><br />The lesson gleaned from Liberace I believe is that the &#039;&#039;gay&#039;&#039; subculture is vulgar, tawdry, and aesthetically illiterate. Its the opposite of &#039;sophisticated&#039;. Liberace had the sensibilities of a circus geek or a carnival barker - and he fantasized about being Caligula. <br /><br />Gays are ultra-crude plebes and simpletons. It says something that people like this are presented as somehow inspired by the cultural commisars. <br /><br />Homosexual activity is by definition an expression of narcissism <br /><br />

				joywind, why are you so concerned about how homosexuals feel about AIDS and so interested in their culture??&nbsp; Sounds to me like you might be a little &quot;curious&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you may need some counseling to take care of that before things get out of hand... or you may end up with someone&#039;s &quot;thing&quot; in your hand.<br /><br />Good luck, bro! I wish you a speedy recovery!<br />

				&quot;Homo-enablers&quot;, what is this guy, Westboro Baptist Church or something?<br />OK no, turns out he&#039;s a weird combination of Walter Mitty and a frustrated wannabe gangbanger (I may have stalked a tiny bit&nbsp; ::) )<br />OK I&#039;m bored now, enjoy being a troll I guess...
