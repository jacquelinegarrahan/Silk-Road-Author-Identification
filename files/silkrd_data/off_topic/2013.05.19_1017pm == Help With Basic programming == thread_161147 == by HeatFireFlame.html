				Hi all, have already posted this in a topic,However i think it may be in the wrong topic. Thanks for all your help in advance.<br /><br />Now im fairly up to scratch with basic cryptography and anonymity, enough to keep myself anonymous in general. However i would like to start getting a bit more up to date with coding, programming and the likes.<br />Now i would ask you should i basically be learning HTML,APACHE or UNIX? I know their is a good guide to learning at W3schools. But im looking for the book A+ certification as apparently it&#039;s something you need to read when starting out. Does anyone know where i can find a free version of this book?(even a pdf file)<br /><br />also does anyone have any recommendations for getting started out with programming, I mean from scratch, Consider i know nothing, Right from the ground up;.Where would i start? To get a basic knowledge of the workings of Pc&#039;s,(i already know basics of this but would like to recap really)&nbsp; programming and coding.<br /><br />Thanks all.

				A+ certification has nothing whatsoever to do with programming.&nbsp; Ignore whoever told you that it&#039;s useful for that.&nbsp; UNIX is an operating system, not a language.&nbsp; Apache is a web server and also is not a language.&nbsp; HTML is a markup language -- which means it allows you to &quot;mark up&quot; text with specific tags -- it isn&#039;t a programming language though.<br /><br />Just start out with Python or Ruby and online tutorials.&nbsp; Either of those languages will be just fine; neither is better than the other -- the differences are just personal preference, really.

What&#039;s your preference, Python or ruby seeing as your helping me out with the advice it seems to be as good a place as any to start. And would i need to learn HTML before learning Python or ruby?<br /><br />By the way i wasnt told to read A+ cert by anyone, it just seemed to be the basis of some working knowledge, so i figured i would read it. <br /><br />So overall, Where to start? Any good tutorials?

				I taught myself, starting with Python. Did a lot of web tutorials and stuff, but to be honest, if you don&#039;t have a comp sci background, there&#039;s no substitute for a good book. I learned 10 times as much from Learning Python by Mark Lutz as I did from all the web guides combined. Understanding fundamental concepts is more important than memorizing a bunch of syntax.<br />

				libgen.org is my go-to place. Works over Tor and there&#039;s no torrenting involved. You can download straight from mirrors. :)<br />

				If you want to start REAL basic start with VisualBasic.<br /><br />More than programming you learn the core of programming, syntax, variables, arguments etc. Plus you can create boxes, buttons, calculator programs etc and test them while you&#039;re making them on a GUI (graphical user interface)<br /><br />When you want to get into actual writing of code. Like SS said Python is a great start. You could also start with Java as its used widely but I find people who start with Python have an easier transition into Java as compared to those who might jump straight into Java (not saying it doesn&#039;t work, just some people find it a bit confusing especially when you get into some more &quot;advanced&quot; concepts)<br /><br />In order here is what I would suggest to get a good grasp on things<br /><br />- Python<br />- Basic Java<br />- C/C++<br /><br />after you learn three you&#039;ll probably find yourself wanting to learn more yourself, programming is something that you constantly keep updating throughout life. If you get through 1-2 of these languages and realize it&#039;s not for you, then just try to improve your knowledge on Java and Python as much as possible

That link is invaluable, May i post this in my thread for the newbies? or course i will give credit. <br />Im on there now and have searched for<br /><br />python mark lutz&nbsp; got loads of&nbsp; hits, there seem to be many editions and once it gets up to fourth the title changes from learning python to &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming&quot; is there any difference? Also what about a program for running your code on, any recommendations? Thanks for your time<br /><br />touchthesky thank you, I shall look it up as well .

				one thing I did was also start doing some maths and science along with programming.<br /><br />Programming is basically all about logic. Math and Science teaches you to be very analytical and logical. Helped me out a great deal when designing algorithms and my code
