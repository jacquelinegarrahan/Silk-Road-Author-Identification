				He is clearly a cop, and I&#039;m not just saying that for no reason as many of you know. <br /><br />Some of the things he says are so outrageous that no reasonable person could sincerely believe it. Unless he were a Meth/Crack head, though, if that were the case, his Grammar would not be as good as it is. The combination of his good grammar, ability to troll to the max when accused of being an LE, and his ridiculous &#039;opinions&#039;(Vac Sealed Weed automatically = Schwag? The fuck?) - paint the picture of a person trying intentionally trying to say things to get under the skin of others without believing them himself. <br /><br />When you try to pose logical pointers to why he may be wrong on any kind of opinion he proposes, he gets extremely childish, and insulting, even if you did not insult him in the slightest. You disagree with him on anything - you&#039;re an LE in his eyes. Lol Seriously.<br /><br />He thinks all good vendors are LE? <br /><br />I mean, shit, Just look at his signature!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Common sense dictates that LE would infiltrate SR and its forum. They will pose as buyers and sellers to scam you and ruin your feedback and steal vendors&#039; drugs.<br /><br />Beware the highest ranked vendors unless you&#039;re comfortable buying drugs from LE.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve seen him argue time and time again that all high ranking dealers are LE who stole drugs from other vendors and sell them for profit. Obviously not the case when a high ranking vendor talks about his prices his growers give him and details of his business to a long term customer - information he wouldn&#039;t usually tell people.&nbsp; Not to mention these accused &#039;vendors&#039; getting consistent quality of product that does not point to it coming from multiple sources across the world.<br /><br />MisterDank does practically nothing but troll. His Karma: +1/-14 - that&#039;s rediculous.<br /><br />Why is he allowed on these forums? He does nothing but trash highly respected vendors, who many people have gotten pounds from for many months, of consistent product, and had indepth talks with. <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to jump the gun and call him a LE, even though his behavior SCREAMS LE - trashing every high ranking vendor on practically no grounds, trolling anyone who disagrees with him, even those who peacefully disagree. Not to mention the fact that he tries to slam the act of Vacuum sealing by saying it ruins weed. This is something an LE would want, an LE wants your package to stink, it doesn&#039;t want you sealing the smell in. Anyone who has ever ordered a vac seal bud knows it does not damage the product...I&#039;m not going to say for a fact he is LE, even though all signs point to yes, But I am going to say he is a TROLL, and this cannot be argued. I&#039;m sure everyone here on the forum agrees with me. <br /><br />I personally feel he should be banned for such LE behavior, and if not for that, he should SURELY be banned for trolling and starting Flamewars as badly as he does. It&#039;s god damn rediculous that mods haven&#039;t done anything about this yet. He is literally harshly negative to anybody who doesn&#039;t strongly agree with him. Even if you show signs of disagreeing, it seems he tries to troll you. Just look at any of his post anywhere! This can&#039;t be argued!

The last one I read about intercepting packages and stealing goods just got me thinking that he was actually already involved in some sort of scheme like that to be able to devise something so far fetched and diabolical. I would certainly be weary of any dealings with him needless to say for any who were not aware. I recommend some of the higher rated vendors personally.<br /><br />Be safe,<br />- miR

				If he wasn&#039;t a vendor, i&#039;d find him funny.&nbsp; However, as it stands, I do think it&#039;s quite worrying that people are giving names and addresses to someone who is obviously unstable.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(

				Every post he makes seems to be about &quot;cops or LE&quot;. <br /><br />I seriously doubt he is living in his own paranoid psychotic reality... I get the feeling that what he types is far too artificial. That he doesn&#039;t believe it himself. A strong vibe of a Cop Trolling. <br /><br />I&#039;m simply not going to acknowledge his post. The way he acts on these forums, insulting practically everybody... his existence does not deserve to be acknowledged. If he wants to make money as a vendor, then he should do so in a manner that a vendor should conduct himself, and not make an ass of himself and slander the community in attempts to get people away from quality vendors.

				Some cops are local yocals who never went to college.&nbsp; Others are college educated, and hold degrees.&nbsp; Some cops just work a job.&nbsp; Others invest in their careers.<br /><br />What makes you think you&#039;ll even be able to spot the really savvy ones?&nbsp; And what makes you think the ones that you&#039;ve &quot;identified&quot; are actually cops, and not just trolls?<br /><br />Clearly, we are all LE, and as such, should be banned immediately. ::)
