				I think I&#039;m becoming an SR addict. Before SR (like 2 weeks ago) I would come home from school and sit down and study. Studying came naturally. BUT NOW! Now I come home from school and I turn on the computer to see if something has happened to my order, then I browse SR, look at drugs, google them and read about them. When my parents ask me what I&#039;m doing I say &quot;nothing.&quot; And it gets worse. SR DOESN&#039;T EVEN LEAVE ME ALONE AT NIGHT ANYMORE! Last night I had a dream that I was out trying a job (something kids have to do in school here) and I was trying being an SR vendor. I traveled to a fabric out in the woods, in the middle of nowhere, in Germany. There was just this lab team and nobody else to be seen. They told me nobody even knows they exist. Then we drove around in a big black car all over Germany posting mail in mail boxes all over the country. The last thing I remember is that they told me to major in chemistry in college... <br /><br />My point is that SR is distracting me. I&#039;m constantly thinking about all the drugs I can have and waiting for my first delivery as a little kid counts the days left until Christmas. I used to be a good student, but now I find myself falling behind more than I should in school! WHAT TO DO? Did this happen to anyone else? Will it pass once I get that first delivery?

				It loses its novelty, and you will have more time to study again. I can remember when I browsed SR for the first time, seeing pics of heroin gave me goosebumps. But now, meh? Those are just drugs man. Shiny, cosy, wonderful drugs ^^

So, all I can recommend to you is if you really have no other choice than to FE in the beginning, then do so assuming that shit can go wrong with FE, and be happy if you get your stuff nevertheless.

If you get asked to FE for being new by those, just see what kind of a vibe you get. Good solid vendors will be polite in explaining to you why they require it, and responsive if you have further questions. If not, just come back to the forums and ask around if anyone had similar experiences with that vendor. You&#039;ll be okay in the end.

				Not to go all dad on you bro but seriously stay away from heroin.&nbsp; It&#039;ll fuck your life up before you realize it.&nbsp; Some people might be able to handle it in their life responsibly, but they&#039;re the minority.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen that shit wreck homes and it&#039;s just not worth the high when there&#039;s much safer drugs out there to be putting in your body.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and <br /><br />A) wait till you have your life in order before you decide to experiment with hard drugs, at least that way you know what you have to lose if you get out of control.<br /><br />B) be super careful.&nbsp; Consider safer options, because 2-3 years from now when you need to shoot heroin just to keep from getting sick you&#039;ll look back and be another statistic that wishes they could go back in time and talk to their past self about this decision.<br /><br />Obviously no one can tell you what to do or what not to do but it&#039;s good at least you&#039;re doing your research on things you have an interest in.&nbsp; I just opt to keep people away from opiates because they are a downward spiral into an uncontrollable hell.&nbsp; I, too started out enthralled by the idea of drugs being a click away from my doorstep but the novelty, as many said wears off and much of the same threads get repeated on the forums, so there isn&#039;t a whole lot to do here once you got your goods.<br /><br />We all here chasing highs though, just be smart about which poison you choose, for your own sake.&nbsp; I know my potential for addiction so I stay far away from those types of drugs myself, and lead a very productive/successful life despite my habits (mostly psychedelics and MDMA)

My plate is full at the moment, and if I wanted to do heroin I wouldn&#039;t even have time to research it, order it and do it before summer vacation. It&#039;s not gonna happen.

				I got addicted to SR when I got scammed. Since then I like to watch who I buy from, which has resulted in the accumulation of knowledge which I then share with my fellow Silk Roaders. I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m going to retire very soon though. I&#039;ve stocked up and ran out of coins. Just waiting on my last orders.

Other than that- maybe being on SR all the time is just looking for excitement you feel is somehow missing from your real-life?
