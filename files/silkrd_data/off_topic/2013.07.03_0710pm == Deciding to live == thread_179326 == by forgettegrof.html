				I recently made a thread in which I said I would take my life. I had considered it for quite a while, but I can&#039;t do it. I&#039;m not afraid to die, I just realize that there are people in my life who care about me, that I can&#039;t just give up like that. Life is so difficult sometimes, but it&#039;s a gift at the same time. I am too young and I finally am starting to feel hope. I realize that we&#039;re not made to feel happy, that we have to strive beyong our limitations and shortcomings. I am so thankful for this community and confidence in myself. I think I needed to sink to a low to realize what I actually had. I became greedy, I needed more and more for &quot;happiness.&quot; I came to realize that happiness comes from being thankful for what you have and my ability to love the individuals in my life. Life seems so uncertain, but that just means that I need to go out and strive for a life I can be proud of. Thank you, everyone. We really are all in this together, we&#039;re a family in a way...

				Life never turns out as planned so stop trying to plan life. Just go with the flow my friend, float downstream.<br />A good strong psychedelic experience every now and then never hurt either. In the end the only thing we really have are our memories and each other. Try not to let life stress you out too much, in the end were all dust in the wind.

				Life is a roller coaster of emotions. To experience the true joy of life you have to surf through the lows. It&#039;s something that everyone forgets every now and then, but if you push through it you&#039;ll see how great the rewards of life are. When you finally stop wallowing and decide to go through with life you see that it isn&#039;t as bad as you once thought before.
