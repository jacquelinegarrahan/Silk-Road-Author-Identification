				Hey all =) I wanted to know your opinion. I have been hooked on those stupid damn devil *blues* (roxies-whatever you wish to call them personally) for about oh 4 1/2 years now. Used to be a daily user but thankfully have managed to cut myself back to once or twice a month as a treat only-usually only 2 or 3 at a time cause the damn things are so fucking expensive anymore. Back when I started doing them here in my home town they were 9.00 to 12.00 bucks-now as you know they are up to as high as 42 dollars with some people including all my old in person dealers. I&#039;M OVER THIS!! I can&#039;t stand paying that much for a pill!! BUT DAMN they are so good. THEY ARE EVIL! If you have never tried them DON&#039;T-no joke-VERY addictive and the more you do the more you need. ANYHOW... sorry I digress... I know there are duladid-which is&nbsp; almost a twin... and methadone, seboxin (sorry I know that&#039;s spelled wrong) but what I want to know-cause I really don&#039;t want to go with any of those-is do you have any suggestions for something even comparable that&#039;s cheaper and works just as good? I wanna new drug of choice. I like coke but well that&#039;s expensive too and short lived and seems now that I&#039;ve been doing these so long nothing else really seems to hit me anymore. My tolerance is way high now. Used to be take 1 pill or do 1 line and I was great to go. Now it seems like I have to do a ton of anything to even get a small high. I&#039;m frustrated. I want so badly to get completely away from these damn things but as many of you know-those things call your name. Sorry if this all sounds retarded... I just really want some good opinions on something new and better =) please? I know some of you will probably yell at me to just go to rehab or stop them all together since I only do them once a month now-and I know that would probably be better but well-I still want my treats damn it lol. So there it is. Thank you!
