				Mimosa hostilis root bark is the most commonly used plant in DMT extraction because of its legality and relative high concentration of DMT compared to similar plants. Up until about a month ago, MHRB could be purchased openly and legally. In September, sonoransong.com was raided by the DEA and all of its MHRB was seized. The government began holding shipments of MHRB in customs. As a result of these events, just about every seller (that I know of) has ceased selling to the US and it seems inevitable that MHRB will be banned at some point in the near future.<br /><br />My question is how do you guys think this will affect the supply, demand, and pricing of DMT on SR?<br /><br />I don&#039;t question that a lot of DMT vendors have their own private sources for MHRB but at least some must have used legal, internet sources. Likewise, people (such as myself) who extract their own DMT don&#039;t really have that option anymore. My exhaustive searching has yielded little but some ridiculously priced Tor listings (I saw 10 grams/$40 on here. $40 used to get you 50 times that.) I think that, at least initially, there will be less listings and the existing listings will go up in price. My ultimate hope is that there becomes a black market demand for MHRB in light of the ban and it becomes readily available to purchase here. In the meantime, if anyone is feeling generous enough to share their own MHRB source with me in PM I would greatly appreciate it as I am currently shit out of luck.

				All the UK wholesalers are unable to source supplies now, I&#039;m guessing they were supplied by US companies.

				Have you tried ordering from mimosahostilis.mx? I haven&#039;t ordered from them since April but I didn&#039;t have a problem. The smallest amount they sold was 1kg for $95. Shipping was included.

If you know a place where I can buy acacia maidenii let me know because I seriously cannot find anything. If there are websites openly selling it they&#039;ve done pretty well at staying under the radar.

				Looks like it&#039;s time for Santo Daime to expand a little more :)<br /><br />It has been getting increasingly harder for mass amounts of Mimosa Hostilis to get into the US (for me) over the past 10 years. <br />Used to be that I could order kilo bricks for close to nothing and have it shipped, came through no problems from south america and western europe. <br /><br />Now pretty much all the suppliers from back in the day I used to know have now stopped exporting my way.

				I have 10kg of mhrb sitting in my basement right now, to lazy to process it right now though its a bit messy and I want to get some industrial gear first.<br /><br />Theirs tones of online vendors that still operate. They don&#039;t really advertise theirs sites and can&#039;t be found directly from a google search. But for people who search you will find! Prices have gone up a little bit right now my best source who no longer operates through a site when not selling to people who are not buying for a legit company sells 10kg/$800 +shipping&nbsp; 100/kg $5000 and 1kg is somewhere around $140, these prices don&#039;t include shipping. Ordering with a CC if fine but I recommend ordering to a PO box. Most MHRB vendors won&#039;t leave a trail for LE in or on the package.

				Source&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://sonoransong.com/wherediditgo.html&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Im currently the only domestic vendor of this substancef DMT left but its expensive due to this shit Sonoransong did.... Flooded the USA with his purple Dye and used Amazon when he had his own MHRB web page, There was no need to go to amazon if you have a site ::)<br /><br />They said<br /><br />We are no longer importing any more Mimosa Hostilis. Sonoran Song was built on our love for Mimosa, and we rose rapidly from relative obscurity to being the top vendor in a matter of months. We had the cheapest domestic prices, the best packaging, and the highest quality MHRB that anyone had ever offered. You loved our customer service, delivery times, and the excessive amount of free mimosa that we gave away. And we loved (and still love) you all. Unfortunately, we found that the US government had been casting it&#039;s ogre-like shadow over MHRB (and related material) for quite some time. They informed us (to our complete surprise) that our wonderful clothing dye contained a controlled substance -- something they called &quot;DMT&quot;. Instead of informing us of their displeasure with our infraction in a civilized manner, they decided to gather an army of men to raid our premises. On September 10th, 2012, our home and offices were raided. They took all of our clothing dye, along with a great deal of unrelated plant material. We witnessed first hand the &quot;war on drugs&quot; taking another violently meaningless stab at our cognitive liberty.<br /><br />Fortunately, the staff here at Sonoran Song were not charged with any crimes. However, the effects of the raid have been fairly substantial. Fearing a similar invasion of their premises, all of the remaining large vendors of MHRB in the USA have ceased carrying it. Many have also discontinued a number of other related plant materials. And, at the time of writing (October 2012), there are no longer any commercial harvesters/suppliers of MHRB left. Before the raid, there were two: Don Jose aka The Galactic Toad (Mexico), and Adenium Mimosa (Brazil). Don Jose seems to be on vacation, having ran away with over $10,000 of our money. Adenium, always a fantastic and highly reliable supplier, recently announced that he is no longer able to take payments for or ship any MHRB to anywhere.<br /><br />Please do not email or call us with any requests for MHRB - we do not have any, and will not import any more. We will also not be carrying any of the related planted materials. If any of you still have any refunds that are due from early September 2012 - please do contact us by replying to your original order email. We are incredibly grateful for all of the relationships that we have made over the past year, and hope to continue building them for many years to come. Thank you all!<br /><br />blessings<br />Robert &amp; the team @ Sonoran Song<br /><br /><br />
