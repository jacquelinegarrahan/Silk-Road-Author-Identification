				I just bought a quarter sheet of hallucinogens from a very reputable dealer and I decided to test it... turned out to be bunk as fuck. Read the reviews for not only the listing, but for every quantity of the product that I bought, and they all have good fucking reviews. Then why the fuck did I receive bunk tabbage?&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />P.S. I know these types of posts are usually from a level 10 grandmaster tin-foil hat crafter but I&#039;m just really disappointed right now.

When you say test, do you mean by reagent or by taking it? Also, if the vendor is HardHustle and the hallucinogen is 25i, I think someone made a comment in his review-thread earlier today about getting some bunk stuff.

				don&#039;t quote me on this but the lsd would need to be exposed to high heat (over body temperature) for a fairly long time for the lsd to be significantly ruined.&nbsp; unless the government KNEW exactly your package had lsd, it doesn&#039;t sound feasible that they would blast every letter with heat for a long time. i don&#039;t even know where in a mail sorting facility they would have the capability<br /><br />i&#039;d just talk to the dealer and let him know what&#039;s up.&nbsp; have you tried any of goods? how do you know they&#039;re bad?

				Absolutely not. This would take so much manpower that they cannot afford. I also would think people who aren&#039;t sending drugs through the mail would have a problem with this. The effectiveness of &quot;heat scanning&quot; to destroy LSD is also questionable. Also, LEO&#039;s do not want to destroy drugs, they want to arrest people for them to fill their quotas.

				No.<br /><br />But your tabs could could have degraded from oxygen or heat exposure. Those trucks and airplane cabins get fairly hot.

				too much fluctuation in temperature destroys lsd aswell.
