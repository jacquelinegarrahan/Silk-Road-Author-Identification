				I love jamming out on the guitar and learning as many songs as I possibly can. Anyone else play? What songs do you feel are a must learn?<br />Ill get it started with a couple that I feel any guitarist should strive to learn:<br /><br />-Stairway To heaven by Led Zeppelin<br />-Dust in the Wind by Kansas<br />-Wish you were here Pink Floyd<br />-Blackbird by the Beatles<br />-Melissa by the Allman Brothers<br />-Angie Rolling Stones<br /><br />Just a couple off the top of my stoned head. Any suggestions?<br />

				I&#039;ve been learning myself some guitar on and off for the past few years, per www.justinguitar.com and have been having a blast of it! I can play things I didn&#039;t think id be able to soo early.<br /><br />But the songs you listed are still a little out of my skill level.<br /><br />I know lots of open chords, some barre chords, power chords, and I&#039;m getting pretty decent at stringing them together.<br /><br />Also was working on the minor pentatonic scale and more recently one of the major scales... but these I am not so good at using. I&#039;ve been trying really hard, but it seems like if a song gets more complex than just rhythm and chords (if I wanna make it cry or sing), I just can&#039;t make my fingers work the right way with it. Can&#039;t get myself to where I&#039;m comfortable with justins beginners course enough to seriously progress in the intermediate, and I can&#039;t figure out why. I haven&#039;t played for a couple months as a result.<br /><br />As to your question, if I was a good guitar player, I would absolutely learn sultans of swing by dire straits (which is taught on justin&#039;s site). That song gives me full body orgasms.

				LOL. No stairway! It really is a great song though, and with all the transitions if you can play it clean it will make you a better player. <br /><br />What else is wrong with the list? I love classic rock. I can play a lot of newer shit STP, pearl jam, avenged sevenfold, but my inspiration comes from the classic rock bands of the 60s an 70s. <br /><br />How bout Neil Young? My my hey hey. Needle and the damage done. Oldman?

				@ Psilocybin <br /><br />Hey man sounds like you&#039;re on the right track. If you can play chords and bar chords just check out ultimate guitar. Melissa is all chords. Wish you were here is a little bit of picking but has to be the easiest song to learn (was my first). Keep at it.<br /><br />Justinguitar.com huh? Ill have to check it out.

				I spent like 2 years trying to learn, never got good because I never practiced. I want to be able to play an instrument but I lack the motivation to learn

				I used to strum the git-fiddle, still do occasionally.<br />I used to play Veil of Maya type of music, but then evolved into Protest the Hero type stuff.<br />(Both Veil of Maya and Protest the Hero are incredible bands, you should check them out)<br /><br />sdesu

				I play bass guitar. Don&#039;t know any theory, and I hardly remember any of the songs I&#039;ve learned to play, but I can improvise spontaneously, which is a lot more fun anyway.

				Hey yea trypt. Jamming is what its all about. I love to be able to play a song that I grew up listening to around the campfire and singing with some buddys. Good times, but nothing beats just jamming and creating your own cool shit. Especially when you have a few instruments.<br /><br />

				As a drummer, if i&#039;m having difficulty with a beat or breakdown, I find it heaps easier if I can play the song on guitar! If i had access to a piano, that&#039;d be so rad.<br /><br />I&#039;m a big believer in learning music while you learn the instrument, I&#039;ve got some brass and woodwind under my belt as well! The guitar took me about 2 yrs of proper practice before i would say I can play it, but now it&#039;s a tool more than an artists brush. I paint with my kit!!!

				Been playing for 5 or so years now, glad I picked it up tbh! Never good at sports, other instruments, not really alot hah, but I seem to have found my niche. <br /><br />Used to play alot of classic/hard rock. Aerosmith, Led Zep, Jimi Hendrix, The Eagles are all great to play to, but I also love the Chili Peppers, specifically the Frusch, playing alot of Pearl Jam lately and also The Strokes have alot of kickass guitar songs.
