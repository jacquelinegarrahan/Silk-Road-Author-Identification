				I&#039;m going to a major US city for a week and wanted to have a package sent to my hotel. Anyone have experience with this? Are vendors willing to do it? I&#039;m talking about a small quantiy of weed, nothing crazy. Thanks!

				I can&#039;t see how this would work out for you man. Unless hotels have changed since I&#039;ve been in one, you don&#039;t exactly have a box for mail to go to which means your drugs are going to be handled by at least one-three hotel staff members. I don&#039;t think anyone on SR would chance that shipment. <br /><br />Good luck to you though

I&#039;ve had legit stuff sent to hotels before I&#039;ve arrived in the past (ski goggles, a laptop, etc). I didn&#039;t think that would be the sticking point. Hopefully I can find a vendor willing to ship to a hotel - I don&#039;t see why not but figured I&#039;d ask here if anyone has experience with it. Thanks!

				I tried that once. I won&#039;t go into details, but it didn&#039;t work out very well.<br /><br />The best option, to get it to your hotel, would be to have it shipped to your home address, then send it to the hotel yourself.<br /><br />Works much better.

				It&#039;s no big deal.<br /><br />You tell the front desk you&#039;re supposed to receive something. Or just wait and see.<br /><br />How the fuck do hundreds of business people who travel much get their random shit they need whilst on the road? <br /><br />Just make sure the vendor knows the time factor and is okay with it before hand. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen more than a few successes. You don&#039;t even need a name on there, just a room number. <br /><br />There are rules in commerce fools. I imagine few hotel staff are going to go into someones legally binding shit. What was it again? A federal<br /><br />offense?

				The problem isn&#039;t so much hotel staff.<br /><br />Many hotel chains are notorious for misplacing, returning to sender, etc.<br /><br />As said, I don&#039;t think it would be that big of a deal, just as long as it is a small amount, that you can afford to lose, if it comes to that.

I&#039;ve had things sent before, and they just give me the package when I check in. It&#039;s also an internaional hotel chain, and I&#039;ve stayed there before. Now...to find the right vendor! Thanks :)
