				Which stimulant should I buy? I&#039;ve never had one before. Also, what&#039;s a good one to mix with dissociatives?

				Prescription or non-prescription. World of difference there.<br /><br />For Prescription the ranking is as follows from best to worst<br /><br />Desoxyn&gt;Dexedrine&gt;Vyvanse&gt;Adderall&gt;Ritalin the pricing of these also follows accordingly.<br /><br />Straterra I have not tried and wouldn&#039;t want to.

				It&#039;s generally not quite that way with other drugs. Most everyone agrees that Ketamine is the king of dissociatives. Heroin of opiates, probably acid or maybe DMT for psychedelics. MDMA rules the rave scene. Though there does seem to be more wiggle room for benzos. I would have thought cocaine or meth would top the stimulant charts. But you&#039;re saying it doesn&#039;t matter?

Cocaine does not do it for me at all, I have tried it probably fifty different times over the last twenty years. Each time is is about the same thing. Not really my drug, I have snorted, shot and smoked it. Crack was a little better but way too addictive. Not long term addictive, but once you get on a roll it goes until you cannot get any more. Each time I did that I would geek out for the night and then after sleeping I would not have the desire for it, but yeah I think crack is better than powder coke, both can go in the garbage in my book.<br /><br />I did meth for several years when I was a teenager; smoked, shot, snorted, ate etc. I liked snorting it the best, shooting is too crazy. Desoxyn is methamphetamine hydrochloride. Interesting thing is how the dosage of methamphetamine is, large doses are done by non-pharmaceutical synthesis. Average dose is about 0.05-0.20g at a time. Some people do more, some can get high with less. Desoxyn only comes in 5mg 0.005g! but it is still very strong.&nbsp; The effects are similar, yet very different at the same time. The benefits of desoxyn are the measurability of the drug, the standardization of the dose and the quality. Some people like the dirty shit in street meth. <br /><br />Ketamine is great, I would only buy a sealed vial though as people tend to put weird things where it is not needed. I love snorting K bumps fresh off the hot pyrex plate from the coffee warmer.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done street meth in decades, having health insurance opens the doors to pharmaceuticals. They are great for me. I didn&#039;t need to get smoked on it though. I would actually take as prescribed. Well after the first couple months of playing and the novelty wears off.<br /><br />Fentanyl is preferable to heroin but if I smoke all of my patches the heroin is very available. Plenty of dope dealers peddle in the park across the street from my house. I liked dilaudid, but hydrocodone is a very nice high. I hate acetaminophen though.<br /><br />I still have not got Opana yet, probably do that next.<br /><br />There are desoxyn for sale on the site, but in your case you might just cop some meth as it cheaper.

				My favorite classic stimulant is focalin aka dexmethylphenidate, the high is extremely similar to cocaine but i find it more euphoric and it last much longer. I think its going to come down to cocaine vs. amphetamines from there its personal preference. I have heard 4-FA is quite good but gentle, do you want long lasting energy and some euphoria or just short powerful rushes?
