				A friend of mine just got busted for prescription fraud. Well, kinda.&nbsp; The forged prescription he was using had a google # that forwarded to a throwaway. He had a &#039;secretary&#039; that answered the throwaway for verifications.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the pharmacy, instead of calling the # on the scrip, looked up the Dr&#039;s # and called the correct phone line.&nbsp; The Dr. said that the prescription was forged and for the pharmacist to call LE. <br /><br />The pharmacist told my friend that he knew it was a forgery and that next time he would call LE. My friend high-tailed it outta there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s the rub.&nbsp; He used his REAL NAME&nbsp; (fake addy) and did so on several occasions prior at different pharmacies.&nbsp; He also has used several fake ID&#039;s.&nbsp; He&#039;s spooked and in hiding. I told him not to show his face around here,&nbsp; or anywhere, for that matter. <br /><br />So what do you think, oh great minds of SR, how concerned should he be? Do you think they will investigate? Should he expect a knock at his door? Prescription fraud is at least 5 years, right?&nbsp; Personally, I think he&#039;s fucked.<br /><br /><br />

				my guess is the cops showed up after he left the store.&nbsp; the pharmacist didn&#039;t want to try and stall him til the cops got there, and didn&#039;t want a scene at his business.&nbsp; cops probably still showed up after he scooted.&nbsp; his name is now known, and they&#039;re looking for the correct addy.&nbsp; they have a team of monkies calling other pharms, to see if the same name has showed up, and if addies matched or differed.&nbsp; i&#039;m sure they have his face, from the store&#039;s security camera.&nbsp; yeah, your friend is fucked.&nbsp; he needs to at least skip state for a while.&nbsp;

				Have your friend drive like a maniac until he get&#039;s pulled over, that way you can see if he has a warrant out for his arrest or not. :P
