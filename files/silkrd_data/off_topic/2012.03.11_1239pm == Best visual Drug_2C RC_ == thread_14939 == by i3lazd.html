				2c-e is one of the most visual, it has very little mindfuckery, very clear-headed while patterning and melting persists on objects. Not sure there is much to learn or use this as a tool but it&#039;s very light on your body and easy on the mind while providing some very interesting visuals at times.

				I have no experience with any of the 2C-x&#039;s but I&#039;ve read that 2c-t-7 has great visuals. I&#039;ve also read that there&#039;s a risk of death if you take too much so be aware of that.

				sounds like youve covered most of the heavily visual stuff, i hear 2C-P is very visual but also very long acting compared to other 2C compounds so be careful, its also worth trying 25i-nbmoe, usually it comes in blotter form and is very visual. a friend of mine also had a nasal pump spray with 25e nbome in it, it hits a lot harder and faster with this method but if youre going to make one make sure you know how much the pump delivers in a hit and make your liquid mixture accordingly

				for me, DOC was incredibly visual, almost overwhelming at points. But it is VERY long lasting, ~20-ish hours long. 4-AcO-DMT and 2C-E were both very visual as well. 4-AcO was way easier on the body for me than any of the 2C&#039;s. 4-HO-MiPT had some fun visuals also.

				DMT and DPT are the most intense visual drugs... by miles. I don&#039;t even think this is up for debate. I mean... if you have heroic dosed DMT, you have seen real, animate things. That may sounds odd to those of&nbsp; you who have never smoked it, but there is no common hallucinatory shimmer or trick effect to the things that lie in wait in deep hyperspace- you are simply seeing them, as if they were in the flesh.

				2C-T-7, 2C-T-2, and 25D-NBOMe are the three psychedelics with the most intense and the best visuals.<br /><br />DOC and AMT are almost as good visually but they&#039;re way more smooth, and euphoric, feel a bit more like MDMA.

				I bought a whole gram of 2c-p off moniker a few days ago.. I&#039;ll let you guys know how it is and if he&#039;s legit (on another post) but word on the street is you only need 10mg and your off for a 10-20 hour visual trip.. I just bought a 1000-2000 hour trip.

				my only exerience was last weekend with 2c-E bought a 20mg sample and damn was I sorry I took all of it. Once I got over the Im gonna puke feeling it was pretty good with some speed grins and visuals. But those first couple of hours were horrible. I hate puking for anything. That stuff lasted about 12 hours but I really perfer LSD or shrooms. I eat enough shrooms to talk God and not feel sick in the slightest.<br /><br />Hilly

				&nbsp;@dr34dl0ck I&#039;m pretty certain all 2c-x substances are water soluble, and allegedly 2c-b is the least water soluble. However, I had no scale, so I used simple maths to work out a 2c-b : water ratio and drank it, and it dissolved very easily in standard bottled water and worked like a charm. You should read up about liquid measurement for dosing.
