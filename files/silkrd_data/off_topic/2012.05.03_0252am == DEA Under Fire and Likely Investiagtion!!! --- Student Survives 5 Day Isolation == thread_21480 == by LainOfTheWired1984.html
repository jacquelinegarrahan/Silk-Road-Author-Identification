				http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/02/dea-apologizes-student-left-cell/<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m sure others have already seen this, especially if you live in cal I&#039;m sure. But the DEA is now likely going to be the subject of its own CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION after leaving a college student in a cell FOR FIVE DAYS WITHOUT FOOD, WATER, HUMAN CONTACT! <br /><br />He was in intensive care FOR TWO DAYS after being found HANDCUFFED TO THE CELL. <br /><br />He said he ate a bag of white powder that had been left on the floor, which turned out to be METH.<br /><br />This my friends, is a strong, mainstream wakeup to the brutal and malicious mindset of the DEA and federal-drug agents in general. There is no concern for the human being other than to show its utter domination. Instead, this incredible human being managed to survive and has his story is blowing up all over the mainstream media.<br /><br />

				Yeah I saw this today. What a horrible ordeal. I guess he even broke some glass and carved &quot;I&#039;m sorry Mom&quot; into his arm because he thought he was going to die. From my understanding he was being released as they cooberated that he was just at the house to party and then they forgot to release him. Stupid! End the Drug War! End the DEA! <br /><br />But on a better note, I&#039;m sure the lawsuit will be a nice pay day!

				But guys, the drugs are all just so scary and dangerous. Isn&#039;t all the suffering really worth it?<br /><br />This is another in the long line of horrific atrocities against people who are only guilty of wanting to be in control of their own national boundaries (skin, mouth, etc.).

				Welcome to the prison industrial complex.....better get used to it! Its been going on for awhile now! undocumented immigrants have been getting this treatment for years. And when there done with them they still have to fill all those prisons? Its just like the drones. If you let them loose on the rest of the world they will eventually be used on us.Then we have have those private&nbsp; military contractors come in to protect the gated communities ......but I digress......I got pushed by a cop yesterday! fucking weird times man

				Hey, this guy will probably be glad this happened eventually.<br /><br />I mean yeah it was no doubt torture and horrendous, but he&#039;ll get a few million for it a couple years down the line.<br /><br />Fuck you DEA.
