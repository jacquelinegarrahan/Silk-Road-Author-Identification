				Anyone know what became of the option to use Bitinstant to send cash via Moneygram to an email address and then to a wallet via Coinapult?&nbsp; It was a pretty quick way to get coins in your wallet, whether it be SR or other, but since Bitinstant went down for a bit and came back it seems that option is no longer there.&nbsp; It was one of the &quot;Pay to?&quot; options, &quot;E-mail Address&quot;, but I&#039;m not seeing it.<br /><br />And if anyone knows a similar way of acquiring coinage and moving it to a wallet that&#039;s as efficient as that one was, please do tell...thanks in advance!<br />

				That&#039;s what everyone is saying, but I contacted their support to see if they&#039;re going to bring it back. I guess I was being a bit dramatic, I haven&#039;t done much research into Mt. Gox, but it looks just as simple. BitInstant &gt; CVS &gt; Mt. Gox Account &gt; Wallet (SR or a few diff wallets first to remain anonymous). I think it&#039;s even a little cheaper this way because you can try buying below market price. Am I right or wrong? Just trying to make sure this info is correct, I haven&#039;t actually tried this method yet.

				I&#039;m having this problem too because their interface with trustcash is effed up so you can&#039;t make a bank deposit either. I&#039;m going to try Blue Sky Traders http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/9f0dd63e28 as this vendor allows anonymous cash deposit at a bank and then send it to you via SR. Has good feedback. I&#039;ve been a bitinstant via trustcash to email or wallet user normally.

				Here&#039;s a copy paste from a few hours ago, after I messaged Bitinstant about the situation.<br /><br />&quot;The Bitcoin address and bitcoin to email options are temporarily off our site for system updates. These options should be back up in the next couple weeks. We are unable to process any new orders to btc wallet addresses or email manually or over the phone. If you&#039;d like to use our service for bitcoins you will need to create an account with one of the listed exchanges including Bitstamp, BTC-e, MtGox or PayPal. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.&quot;<br /><br />I have had Paypal for years, so I&#039;m giving it a shot. - If are thinking of this, beware, there is a note about &quot;adding funds&quot; to your paypal account-having nothng to do with BitInstant or SR, and it says that getting funds into your PP acct using your bank, may take a 3-5 days. Weird because, when I use Ebay, they automatically withdraw from my checking account. Could be since they started doing biz with BTC&#039;s<br /><br />They list a 2nd option on Paypal to fund your paypal account. - Greendot MoneyPak- I&#039;m giving this option a try. - Not taking any chances. <br /><br />I never did this, but I&#039;ve seen them near the Gift Cards and pre-paid phone cards at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; So here I go!<br /><br />I&#039;ll report back what happened. And if it works, I&#039;ll report back soon with how it went,&nbsp; the time it took etc.&nbsp; - It&#039;s almost 7:30 PM NYC time. Leaving now, should be back in an hour or so. - <br /><br />Stay tuned <br /><br />Jagfug<br /><br />PS BitInstant&#039;s customer service is second to none. When I was a noob, they were great with me. When I made stupid mistakes they were great with me. Also very fast response time for emails. <br /><br />So don&#039;t curse them out. They are doing YOU a favor. They&#039;ve had to fight money laundering charges just to keep helping people like you and me. The fee they charge is more than fair. So cool your druggie brain, and don&#039;t bite the hand that feeds your addiction. - TTYL

				Well here it is over 7 hours later, and this is a major problem BitInstant is having. - They claim as an alternative, to use one of the other option like Paypal. - I guess I should&#039;ve checked, Paypal doesn&#039;t get you bitcoins.&nbsp; All this did was make a payment slip up for me to go down to Walmart or CVS and pay them to pay Paypal, when I already have an account with Paypal. <br /><br />I feel like a fool. I figured since Paypal is listed on the right, along with the other bitcoin providers, that it would work. <br /><br />All I did was buy a Greendot MoneyPak Card, drive home, go back online, and get a ZipZap invoice. Which can only be paid by moneygram, and that has to be cash in person. <br /><br />If I were to follow through, I would be paying ZipZap, with Paypal, to put money in my Paypal. - <br /><br />Yes I know there were other options like MT Gox (ripoff) and other cumbersome and confusing alternatives. <br /><br />They should just take down the entire site of offer another workaround. <br /><br />So, my advice? Find another way, if the BTC to Email is the only way you&#039;ve been using, like me. <br /><br />I&#039;m waiting I guess till business hours to get an answer back. <br /><br />I&#039;ve sent emails to Bitinstant - ZipZap - MoneyGram and Paypal. alerting them all that there is going to be a flood of orders connecting them all together. <br /><br />This is a conundrum. <br /><br />I&#039;m open to suggestions. - I cringe at the idea of setting up another account with another bitcoin dealer, with a new password, and having to learn how they work. <br /><br />This is so disappointing. <br /><br />If I get any resolution to my problem I&#039;ll let you know, also I&#039;ll check back to see if anyone has a suggestion. Those other sites Bitinstant offers look confusing, and made by and for stock market computer geeks. - Such a pain in the ass. <br /><br />I am bummed out. <br /><br />Now I feel like cursing out somebody. Myself ! ! !- <br /><br />Well nothing good ever does last forever. <br /><br />I hope Bitinstant gets their shit together. - OR someone out there has an alternative to Bitinstant that&#039;s almost as easy. - Can&#039;t wait to start choosing new passwords, and learning another way.&nbsp; Oh Joy!

				BitInstant claimed this temporary glitch was due a small problem (undisclosed), Suddenly BTC to Email was put back up, only now requiring your DOB, and REAL NAME. <br /><br />So I guess my assumption that it&#039;s no big deal, was quite foolish. <br /><br />Sounds like the feds raided BitInstant, and were busted, as an accesorry to drug trafficing in all differnt codes laws drugs DEA laws. - In exchange for a lite sentence bring the site back online, and let our agents staff your computers. Now, after they said it would be weeks, the BTC to email is back, requiring your date of birth. - If they get you it&#039;s entrappment, but what lawyer, unless you&#039;re loaded with money, is going to defend you???<br /><br />This is VERY scary. - Do not trust this site. <br /><br />I thought they were trustworthy, there is no reason they need to know your birth date, even the name thing. - Asked my Name I used my nickname ( I have I&#039;d under both-diff SS#&#039;s)&nbsp; Yet they had my old legal name that I used once. <br /><br />Why would they need my name. I&#039;m sending money, not receiving it. - If someone sends me a check, I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s a gov&#039;t mistake, I fly like superman to cash it before they change their mind.)<br /><br />Them shutting down with no press announcement, no fanfare, just a small link and a vague story about &quot;improvements&quot;, saying weeks until it&#039;s back, then next day (yesterday Wednesday Eve Nov 7th 2012-) Bticoin to email is back up demanding birthdate??- How will they verify??? - Also it was so hastily brought back, that the choice of birth month drop down, left out December for most of the night. <br /><br />Stay away, until further information - Sounds like they&#039;re co-operating with LE ! ! !

				There are pretty much only 4 ways the feds can bring down SR or at the least hinder its operations. It looks like the feds could possible be attempting one of these strategies.\<br /><br />1. Is bringing down the Tor network which is pretty much impossible for the DEA or any other NAZI LE agency to do on there own due to the vast complexity of the tor network.. Aliens might be able to though. <br /><br />2. Militarized the postal system. Having a permanent military occupation of all postal facilities along with expensive detection equipment. <br /><br />3. Attempt to regulate, manipulate, and contain the bitcoin economy.<br /><br />4. laissez faire - Do nothing. This s my favorite one. if states continue to end prohibition on marijuanan and other drugs in the furture. eventually&nbsp; The Silk Road will become obsolete. and the drug war will be over. sort of

				MtGox seems a viable conduit from bitinstant, it introduces an extra step, but as long as you don&#039;t access them from tor, and don&#039;t trade large amounts, it appears they only require an email address for account creation.&nbsp; Am I missing something here?<br /><br />But now I keep hearing that bitinstant is taking much longer than normal to release coins, has anyone experienced this?&nbsp; I&#039;m really hesitant to pay the fees that even the legitimate BTC vendors on the road charge, and it seems that turnaround time is really variable, can take as long as 24-48 hours according to what I read and hear.<br /><br />Guess there aren&#039;t any more guaranteed quick methods to get coins, so may just have to get used to planning ahead - crap! ;)<br /><br />
