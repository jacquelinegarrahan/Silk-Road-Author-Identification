				So i have a bunch of Pure DMT, how to i make it orally active?&nbsp; I know i need to combine it to a MOAI but i don&#039;t know how.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any Chem majors out there wanna spread the love?&nbsp; Smoking DMT is cheating the mind of the actual experience.&nbsp; Amazing none the less, I just want the full experience.

				be sure you read up on MAOI&#039;s, they can be extremely dangerous with a lot of over the counter medications or prescriptions, even certain foods, herbs<br /><br />have you tried dmt-nexus.me ? there seems to be a wealth of information out there, MoonUnit refers to that place a lot.<br /><br />and why is smoking cheating the mind? smoked DMT is more intense in ways, and less in others. its cheating yourself not to have tried both, but the experiences are what matters. to think you are getting robbed by not having a long trip seems like a quick judgement. longer isn&#039;t always better.<br /><br />

				Smoking DMT is cheating the mind of the actual experience.&nbsp; ? it is the experience ? im confused.. smoking dmt is a short intense journey but you dont have the build up and relaxation compared to the 8 hour ayahuasca experience. Good luck

				ayahuasca gets its name from banisteriopsis caapi, a jungle vine essential to the brew. the caapi is combined with plants containing dmt (such as psychotria viridis). you can make pharmahuasca by combining dmt with harmaline, which can be extracted from peganum harmala (syrian rue).<br /><br />For pharmahuasca, 100 mg N,N-DMT and 50 mg harmaline is usually the recommended dosage per person. However, combinations of 50 mg harmaline, 50 mg harmine, and 50 mg, N,N-DMT have also been tested with success. As a rule, the fewer the Î²-carbolines, the less the nausea; the more DMT, the more spectacular the visions. The constituents are put into separate gelatin capsules. The capsules with harmaline/harmine is swallowed first and the capsule containing the DMT is taken some fifteen to twenty minutes later. The purely synthetic MAO inhibitor Marplan is also suitable in place of harmaline and harmine.

				you should look into &quot;changa&quot;<br /><br />or, you could just buy some caapi to make tea for use with your dmt.&nbsp; after you drink caapi tea you could smoke or eat DMT and trip off it mad hard
