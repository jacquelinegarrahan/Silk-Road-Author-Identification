				http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/laser-can-instantly-scan-you-anything-and-you-would-never-know-it<br /><br />That inconspicuous brown box above is reportedly a new kind of laser-based molecular scanner that can collect spectroscopic information from more than 150 feet away. It can instantly probe your clothing and luggage for chemical traces of anything--explosives, drugs, biological matter--and you will never even know it.<br /><br />So says Gizmodo in a mildly terrifying piece posted this morning about Genia Photonics’ laser scanning device, contracted by an entity called In-Q-Tel, which is basically a group of private technology incubators working for the CIA. The idea, reportedly, is to install this molecular scanner in airports and border crossings and the like, where it can deliver instantaneous (it analyzes in just 50 picoseconds) spectroscopic analysis of people and cargo from a distance--and likely from an unseen location. Authorities could scan everyone passing through an airport terminal, sports stadium, or customs check.<br /><br />Or it could scan everyone simply walking down a street. It’s supposedly portable, so it could be deployed anywhere from far enough away that the subject wouldn’t have to know about it. Reports Gizmodo&#039;s anonymous author:<br /><br />“The small, inconspicuous machine is attached to a computer running a program that will show the information in real time, from trace amounts of cocaine on your dollar bills to gunpowder residue on your shoes. Forget trying to sneak a bottle of water past security—they will be able to tell what you had for breakfast in an instant while you&#039;re walking down the hallway.”<br /><br />DHS says the technology will be ready for deployment in just one or two years. You can practically hear the privacy rights groups gathering their pitchforks for this one.

They have been building these 129 bases day and night, unceasingly, since the early 1940&#039;s. Some of them were built even earlier than that. These bases are basically large cities underground connected by high-speed magneto-leviton trains that have speeds up to Mach 2. Several books have been written about this activity.

				The late (and presumably murdered) Phil Schneider spoke about what he called an Electro Magneto Leviton Train System that traveled at speeds in excess of Mach 2.<br /><br />The VHST and its proposed routes, (vast advanced tunnel systems) at the time of it’s conception in the early 1970′s, fit and follow other underground base researchers findings as well as some of my own.<br /><br />An interesting aspect within the Rand Corp. document is the fact that the tunnels are way to expansive to pump all of the air out at once to create the frictionless environment needed travel at speeds in excess of 10,000+ MPH.<br /><br />The air has to be evacuated from the tunnel system in segments with large crucially timed mechanized door systems as the train passes through each vapor locked section.<br /><br />Electrical and mechanical noises would ensue from such operation of massive airlock doors throughout the tunnel system once the underground bases or VHST were fully operational.<br /><br />During this process strange air like sounds, hums, and mechanized sounds would persist especially if the tunnels were at a depth of 400 – 800 feet (semi shallow in underground base terms). Energy is also returned into the system as the trains decelerate.

				&nbsp;The CIA’s chief technology officer, Ira “Gus” Hunt, told an audience at an industry gathering, the GigaOM Structure Data conference, on March 20 that the agency strives to gather every kind of communication that exists—text messages, tweets, emails, videos, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />“The problem of Big Data,” Hunt said, “is the following: the database of useless information is 500 million gigabytes, the database of useful information is 5K. Our problem is, which 5K?”<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />“The value of any piece of information is only known when you can connect it with something else that arrives at a future point in time,” Hunt said. “Since you can’t connect dots you don’t have, it drives us into a mode of fundamentally trying to collect everything and hang on to it forever, forever being in quotes of course.”<br /><br />http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/cia-strategy-collect-all-data-and-keep-it-forever-130325?news=849534

				yeah i&#039;ve seen some research in a university with this using a terrahertz laser. though it wont be commercially viable any time soon - terrahertz lasers are extremely expensive. until a way is found to (relatively) cheaply produce them, i cant see them being implemented

				@ Jack N Hoff<br /><br />I agree that the american military industrial complex is totally fucked. Leading the charge for globalization, and the rabbit hole goes deeper than anyone would ever want to believe.<br /><br />However, the capabilities of your local police are a far cry from the military. We are not fully Orwellian just yet.. and this technology is realistically probably not going to be deployed in airports or streets due to the obvious privacy concerns. That does not mean &quot;they&quot; won&#039;t use it, of course, but that does mean you will have to pop up on federal radar before having to worry about that kind of surveillance.

				Damn some crazy shit Jack, lol as you can see they have done a great job into turning people into such greatly mannered Sheep lol, it is sad. I am sure part of the so called, &quot;HiveMind&quot; programming is to make people extremely skeptical, that way even if a tiny scratch of their &quot;hidden surface&quot; happens, most civilians will just turn a blind eye to it and think, &quot;hahaha yeah right&quot;. Heres a funny example, as I am sure most &quot;average&quot; people do not use high powered telescopes ever, yet they will all believe there is an object in space if they are told on the news or something. There will be no question to its existence. Why do people trust the government and the news so much? I would very much easily be able to believe an article or something, that stems from a journalist of some kind (regardless of their experience) than the scumbags we call Government. But maybe this is because I have broken through the &quot;HiveMind&quot;? I dont know. And yes there is some sort of &quot;hivemind&quot; being implemented on the people regardless of how its done, it is quite obvious. I have tried to explain chemtrails to some people and stuff, and I have had many people even give me the exact same response, word for word, It is actually kind of creepy to be honest. But it is true, we live in a nation of blind people, most completely dependant on their daddy government. People are slowly waking up though, I feel there are many more people with opened eyes than in say 2010, but not quite enough yet. I can feel it though... there is a revolution of sorts brewing, Its gonna be bigger than any other before, I almost sure of that.

				They also have RFID chips in all passports, ID&#039;s and even credit cards. These chips are extremely easy to hack, it is kind of scary. And someone, I wont name names because I will be labeled a conspiracy nut, but someone has EVERYONE implanted with thousands of little nanobots, dont bash on me either because I have done REAL research with my own 1000x color microscope and know what the fuck I am talking about. Only thing scientists at the Carnicom Institute have been able to find out is they are mostly made of silicon, and they turn the Iron in your blood from +2 molecule to a +3 which restricts the amount of oxygen being carried to all of your organs. Someone is deliberately killing us, literally snuffing us out. I am currently experimenting with colloidal silver, and if anyone is interested in trying to get rid of their own nanobots, pm me.

It started with relatively plausible things and soon developed to a full blown psychosis when he would think his gmail account was being watched -- and I mean REALLY watched as someone sitting and reading through his email-- because he was spreading &quot;the truth&quot;, and eventually led him to quit his job to run to the hills (sounds really really ridiculous) to prepare a bunker and stock food for the upcoming alien war that was to happen december 2012 (rings a bell?), and that I would know for sure he was right when the pyramids started to explode -- yeah THAT crazy). Of course, nothing of the sort happened. Neither the military appeared at his doorstep. So, i&#039;m not speaking about how cell phones can trace you, or about how bits of info you type everyday in the clearweb can be used to profile you, or how having a facebook account is obviously helping &quot;them&quot; keep track of you and what you do and what you know, because that is obvious. I&#039;m talking about really crazy shit. I&#039;m sorry i&#039;m kinda skeptic, and do want to believe some of these stuff because i find them interesting but some claims are clearly paranoid (and i dont mean &#039;oh i think my mails being watched&#039; kind of paranoid. I mean REAL schizofrenic paranoia).<br /><br />As for the projects the military ddevelops, of coirse there are things we don&#039;t know, for they are strategic stuff against other countries. Just because we are in a &quot;democracy&quot; and globalization and cosmopolitan countries and all that bullshit doesnt mean we are not at constant war risk. Simply vecause that is what we humans do. We create empires and destroy and slave everyone else. So I dont think military money would be spent in detecting what is in peoples bodies, but rather to develop crazy belical stuff, bombs, bunkers, things that would come in handy at war time. just my opinion, not in anyway &quot;the truth&quot; as there is not such truth. there is reality and we can&#039;t know everything about reality, that&#039;s just old and good instinctive fear.

				the control group is set by running the fibers through the FBI&#039;s machine that analyizes manmade fibers and has a database storing EVERY kind of manmade fibers and the differences between different manufactures and stuff. Guess what? NO MATCH, whatsoever. check out carnicominstitute.org if you wanna learn more about the nanofilaments, not much else to do about them but learn about them, but I encourage people to read about them, and then take their own skin samples and whatnot and check it out in a microscope, preferably colored. They are also known as morgelleons fibers, since some people get physical symptoms of sores that heal extremely slowly or not at all and produce fibrous materials and other very weird things from them. Lol I agree this shit is bat nuts crazy, but the craziness is not inside my mind I can assure you that lol

I do wish to open peoples eyes, but in the condition the world is in now I am mostly worried about my own well being and health and will use most of my energy for that purpose, not argueing with sheep =p

				Yes bro just laugh it off, just curious, are you ever in the middle of a sentence and know 100% the word you are about to say yet you completely forget it at the same time? And it pisses you off until finally you eventually remember the word? But usaully it is a simple word you cannot understand how you forgot it in the first place?

				Yep, but for somereason noone thinks that is significant, well I think its fucking nuts, why do we have ALIEN FIBERS IMBEDDED IN OUR LIVING TISSUES! but a good video that connects a lot of the things your are saying make this inconcievable (which it is very far from) is &quot;What Are They Spraying&quot; Its a pretty informative document on chemtrailing and its link to the fibers and other toxic chemicals showing up in soil and water samples ALL OVER THE PLANET, but I would assume documentaries just &quot;arent your thing&quot; cmos, lol

				Also, I am not worried about what people like or do not like, I am worried about hard facts, things I can observe with my own senses. I am not here to make crazy outlandish claims as everything I have said is backed by 100% true research. I also will not rant much more about it as most people who&#039;s eyes are still closed for whatever reason seem to never be able to wrap their heads around these ideas, without a speck of their own research automatically reverting to the same though, &quot;Oh that is fucking nuts, he is crazy haha&quot;

				Yes they are 100% proven manmade, their structures can only be described as a mix between genetically modified virus cells, a type of parasitic fungus, and 1 or 2 other things I cant exactly remember, trust me bro they are not natural, lab tests show they are majorly comprised of silicon which is commenly used in a lot of nanbot technology applications.

				They are made of fully inorganic materials, and small enough to fit inside a human cell. From a carnicom institute study first logged in May 16 this year, they found that the filaments are converting the Fe+2 in our hemaglobin to Fe+3 which makes it horribly inefficient at bonding with oxygen, literally depriving us of oxygen, haha makes me wanna get a tank of pure O2, anyone have a source for those??

				Well my thing is real academic research. Documentaries mean nothing. And actually you&#039;re being the one saying things you don&#039;t know about, like presuming i&#039;m some moron stupid sheep who believes what the tv is broadcasting. Actually, I did research and I do know what you are talking about. I had a friend mail me new parts of the truth everyday. I read them all, saw all the videos, etc. But never saw or read anything from someone trustable. And he would always come up with the answer &quot;that&#039;s because nobody knows about this stuff&quot;. So the plausible answer from me was &quot;so you&#039;re saying there is noone that believes all this stuff that has studied them for real and published it?&quot;, and he would say &quot;yeah, there is, but they are shut up by the government&quot;. So it comes to a point where it is plain fanatical religious thinking. You only believe your sources, they become sacred dogmas, any arguing that goes against it has a clever paradoxical answer (like the bible thing). And I really read all the stuf open minded as I am an open minded person and I do have my share of &quot;conspiracy thoughts&quot; that I believe are true. He simply couldn&#039;t convince me even when I was open to and wanting to be convinced. Even the psuedo academic stuff he showed me was clearly bogus for anyone who knows highschool physics. Well, guess I&#039;ll have to wait for &quot;the truth&quot; to come to me and stop bothering you guys. I&#039;m off to sleep, my benzo&#039;s kicking in. see you around the forums.&nbsp; ;)

				Oh yes and as for possibility of byproducts, these things GROW like organisms yet have no DNA, they are no accident I can tell you that, lol If you collect some you can literally grow them in a culture dish, their growth traits mimic the parasitic fungus I told you about, that is the only organism in the world that scientist could relate the filimentous growth of the fibers. They are literally nanobots, there is no other way to define them. They can only be measured with nanometers, they are completely synthetic yet behave as organisms. Some people that are very in touch with nature and their energy aura&#039;s can feel the electrical interference within their bodies produced by these nanofiliments, they hate it very much. Oh yes, ever laying in bed or something and get a weird, very faint crawling sensation that goes up your back? I used to think it was just normal, like an itch, but that is the nanobots moving lol. Freaky shit, but dont let it scare you, that is what whoever created these motherfuckers wants us to do, They are fear mongerers, so we must not give them our fear.

				yep, I have put a torch lighter to a clump of the fibers extracted from my mouth with grape juice before for an entire minute, It just bubbled up like when you melt plastic, and was just the same as it started.

				IMO these &#039;laser scanners&#039; are possibly Too sensitive and therefore not a particularly good thing to use for drugs, as there is drug &#039;residue&#039; polluting almost everything!<br /><br />IIRC they tested the air in various Italian cities and could find easily detected levels cannabis, cocaine and caffeine!&nbsp; <br />In fact they noted &#039;seasonal&#039; variations in the use of these drugs were easily &#039;measured&#039;!<br /><br />This would be similar to drugs dogs who&nbsp; &#039;flag&#039; people who are just wearing smelly clothes!&nbsp; It happens a LOT!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Can you imagine these scanners &#039;seeing&#039; EVERY MOLECULE of cocaine on EVERYONE&#039;S banknotes!?! <br />&nbsp;IMHO this is the thing which will stop these being commonly used to detect drugs.<br /><br />having them scan for explosives is another thing altogether, idk but I doubt the levels of &#039;explosive pollution&#039; are nowhere near those of illicit drugs!<br /><br /><br /><br />And as for these &#039;nano-fibres&#039; well, I haven&#039;t seen them &#039;move&#039; but i most definitely HAVE seen them!&nbsp; IME the &#039;fibres&#039; begin as a type of &#039;slime/infection&#039; which is very sticky and gooey, under the eschars (scabs) of people with this &#039;problem&#039;.&nbsp; Often it occurs after some illness where the immune system has been &#039;compromised&#039; to some degree.<br /><br />&nbsp;Much lick the way many viscous liquids will &#039;string&#039; when stretched, this stuff does the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is actually far more &#039;complex&#039; than this, as it appears to &#039;start&#039; with some type of fungal infestion on the skin, which seems to have 3 distinct &#039;variations&#039; as to how it &#039;manifests&#039; .... it&#039;s TRULY fuckin WEIRD SHIT!<br /><br />And yes, they ITCH LIKE FUCK!!!<br /><br />IF it is some type of &#039;bio-weapon&#039; it&#039;s certainly an &#039;interesting&#039; one!&nbsp; idk but why would &#039;they&#039; want to infect people with something which seems to be quite benign?<br /><br />I can only speak for myself but aside from the skin factors it seems to have no other negative &#039;effects ???&nbsp; maybe it&#039;s to &#039;soften us up&#039; for the kill!?<br /><br /><br />who knows?&nbsp; will &#039;we&#039; ever?&nbsp; I honestly have no idea!&nbsp; &nbsp;I have NO doubt there ARE many things going on, paid for and maintained by govt&#039;s like the us one which we know SFA about!<br /><br />The Chinese have a curse that says &quot;may you live in interesting times&quot; ... that is, &quot;interesting times&quot; are usually ones of great change and often turmoil!<br /><br />just my 2 satoshi&#039;s<br /><br /><br />hmmmm motek <br />

				Oh yes, they have Many mental side effects, that are very subtle, I have not been able to prove them 100% because I have not been successful in removing them, But 100% scientific fact from legitimate research shows their role in depleting the oxygen supply in our blood, they make our hemaglobin much less effective at carrying oxygen molecules, That is definitely not something to take lightly. Once I find a way to rid them of my body I will know much much more, and they do move and grow, but very slowly. and I bet if you had that goo that showed up on your skin tested by a lab, significant amounts of silicon would be found =( We are truely living in a science fiction movie lol =p

				@Jack N HOoff<br /><br />Mind=Blown<br /><br />I had a grasp on about half of these things but the tunnel systems and underground bases were actually new to me. Good sources from a good forum member. It would be childish to think SR will last forever, or even for a considerable amount of time,(10+ years) But even though the government will always have the upper hand, civilians will continue to innovate and create products, chemicals and ideas that this wonderful community will adapt to support our freedom. This isnt all about our habits, at least not for me, but our freedom. We are not free here and will never truly be free, But they better put me down or lock me up for life before i will stop fighting to hold the freedoms we have now.<br /><br />Sorta related&nbsp; :o&nbsp; Had a conversation with an Ex-LE about gun control today, and was pleasantly surprised when he backed up my position on the government attempting to reclaim our weapons. That day will come, we already have them shitting bricks with our AR&#039;s, and when it does expect to see me right up on my front porch fighting back until they shoot me dead. <br />

				those are called terahertz scanners I think.&nbsp; they already exist and customs has them but they are not portable and take several minutes to scan a package.&nbsp; I think a technology like this would violate the privacy of so many people, so throughly that there would be a public outcry against their use.&nbsp; still they are scary as fuck either way. imagine one of those mounted on a drone flying over suburban neighborhoods, dispatching cops to everywhere that it detected the smallest trace of illegal substances...

				Thanks Americans for voluntarily giving away your freedoms for a false sense of security! It would be OK if you Yanks just wanted less freedom for yourselves, (since it&#039;s your country, it&#039;s your business how you want to run it), but you have to force the rest of the world to go along with it. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t been to the USA in 20 years, while I&#039;ve probably been to 25ish other countries in that time.

				The easiest solution to a laser scanner is to use reflective packaging. If the photon can not penetrate the packaging the scanner can not detect the contents. No need for fancy jammers.

Reflective packaging could very well become a promising solution.

				Not A Sheep, Jack N Hoff and mmmm motek. +1 my friends for the best thread I have read in weeks.<br /><br />I started to truly believe in these &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; after 9/11, I saw those building destroyed by controlled demolitions and my mind was blown that a government could do that to it&#039;s own people. From that sickening day I too have been researching, but my research hasn&#039;t gone as deep into morgellons as yours Not A Sheep.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get lesions or scabs or weird goo or pus but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if I, and everyone else were contaminated. <br />Hell, we&#039;re all contaminated, the whole world is contaminated with plastic molecules and that&#039;s just from decades of plastic use and the actions of the oceans and the sun on plastic, and that was inadvertent pollution. Imagine what could be done if you put your mind to it.<br /><br />Plastic particles in every sea creature, on every beach, even th emost deserted pacific island, plastic particles in you and me.<br /><br />Heavy, heady stuff.<br /><br />Not A Sheep - If you do cure yourself with colloidal silver, how to prevent re-infection. Oh and what if your face turns blue, a dead give away you are onto &quot;them&quot; ;)<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				Thanks Pakchoi, right back at ya!<br /><br /><br />hey did anyone hear about the &quot;explosion&quot; tha apprently happened in an DUMB in Virginia last year?&nbsp; It caused a tremor of 2-3 on the Richter scale!<br /><br />I read somewhere it was the &quot;scientist vs the aliens&quot; and the &#039;scientists&#039; destroyed a tunnel for some reason!<br /><br /><br />It had been said they have numerous humans in some type of detention in some of these bases, which are used for genetic experiments!<br /><br />Personally I&#039;d put money, shit, I&#039;d put the house, the kids AND the car, on the FACT that the US (and other) govts HAVE some amazing technology they dont want the public to get their hands on, as it would completely upset the oil truck!<br /><br />IMO it&#039;s the restrictions on &#039;energy&#039; development, by the US govt (et al)&nbsp; which have fucked things badly!&nbsp; <br />sheesh back in the days of Nikola Tesla they were already working on complete control of &#039;power distribution&#039;<br /><br /><br />As well as restricting other information about a huge range of things!&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the UFO footage I&#039;ve seen suggests (to me) that many of these craft are terrestrial in origin. <br /><br />As someone mentioned, they govt tent to try and keep technology of this nature secret, in the hope of having a trump card in a conflict.&nbsp; <br />That they are prepared to &#039;sacrifice&#039; millions or billions of people to maintain the &#039;status quo&#039; which in all reality, is an impossible dream, demonstrates the sociopathic nature of this beast!<br /><br />Great thread everyone, I have to say, the level of intelligent discussion here surpasses every other forum I&#039;ve ever been on, (including the chemistry fora!)<br />It&#039;s great/awesome!<br /><br />m m m motek ;)

				The fucked up thing is if they took all that sick technology and brain-power, they could 100% develop a machine that could scan entire crowds of people for lung cancer/bacterial infections/etc for medical purposes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The govt could take care of its people, costing nothing after the initial pay-off.&nbsp; Of course, nobody wants to actually help cure people early, but instead sell them drugs when they are sick.<br /><br />Volatile compounds have been proven to be correlated with cancers and can be detected incredibly early, there is a huge survival rate.

				Ahhh, that would make too much sense DrDeepWood, lol besides I seriously think the U.S. government is more worried about reducing the population than helping people, haha you really dont think we have a cure for cancer?? haha, I guarantee we&#039;ve had more than 1 cure better than chemo for at least 5 years now. Either shits too expensive or more likely, technology being supressed to help fulfill secret agenda&#039;s unknown to the general public? Hmmm I wonder which one its? Obviously they do not give 2 shits about the budget so its probably not the first lol. People need to stop expecting the government to do everything, Nowadays the government is mostly interested in corporate and capitalist affairs, and the economy is so out of whack they are literally throwing papers and screaming blue in the face at conferences and stuff. Seeing how mostly all important research is funded by government, no wonder we are where we are. If we could figure out a way for everyone to contribute to the good of society more easily and readily, We could totally see more improvements within couples of years I am sure! But right now they just scimm money from the top of our budgets to use for things they want or even use OUR hard earned money in affairs that cannot even be disclosed to us!! I think we have a right to know a lot more than they tell us. We are even bonded for our governments debt by our birth certificates! They treat us like livestock, I really hope some major changes come about in the next 40 to 50 years, supposedly the concsiousness shift will be complete in around 49 years or so, who knows what may happen? lol
