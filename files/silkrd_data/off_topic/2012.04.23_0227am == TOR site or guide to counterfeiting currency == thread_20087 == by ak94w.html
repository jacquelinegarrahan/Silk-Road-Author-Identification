				I talking USD, a guide I can buy in bitcoins thru TOR on how to make your own counterfeit currency. <br /><br />I know people wash 5 or 1 dollar notes and make 20 50 or 100 all the time.<br /><br />So underground community don disappoint me where is the guide at?<br /><br />I recently found a ID making guide and that got me wondering

				I&#039;m interested in this as well. I will say there&#039;s a couple episodes of American Greed dealing with counterfeiters, some good tips in there if they&#039;re accurate. One was using hair spray to fake out counterfeit pens, and one was that counterfeit pens don&#039;t work on some paper (namely the kind they use in phone books). Don&#039;t know if those are true though.<br /><br />But of course, it&#039;s a sure fire way to get Secret Service on your ass fast, and they don&#039;t fuck around with counterfeiters.

				Lol, I&#039;m buzzed so forgive me, but does this NOT sound ironic?<br /><br />Dealer sells fake money at discounted rate (say 50 per 100), people who buy fake money use it to buy bitcoins, which are used to buy fake money AND drugs. <br /><br />Fuckin perfect. But you&#039;d need one hell of a stealthy op to pull this shit off. Like, INSANE web privacy, hardcore failsafes and a great legal defense fund.
