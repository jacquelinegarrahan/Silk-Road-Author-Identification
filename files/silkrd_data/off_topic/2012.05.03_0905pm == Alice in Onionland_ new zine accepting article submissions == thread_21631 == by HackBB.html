				As I&#039;ve been spamming on a couple of others sites we&#039;re currently in the process of putting together a zine for onionland. We are still in the early stages of putting it all together but we&#039;re currently accepting article submissions. Topics we&#039;re looking for range from privacy, security, hacking, fraud, perspectives on recent news and happenings on onion sites, and anything else you think would be a good fit. I thought this forum good for opinion articles concerning the recent bust at Farmers Market and security articles. If you have an article to submit you can use the privacybox below:<br /><br />http://c4wcxidkfhvmzhw6.onion/zine.msg<br /><br />Original content only please. We will be checking for any dupes of articles or posts already out there. Currently there is no deadline for article submissions. We&#039;ll be accepting new articles as long as it takes to fill up our first issue. If you have any questions just leave a reply here. I&#039;ll try to get back to you when I can

				I might write something and send it in.<br /><br />But it will probably be an article about a project I intend to do - &quot;365 - The other end of the telescope&quot; where I and a few friends will attempt to not be sober for an entire year, doing every drug known in the process, and doing a whole host of ridiculous things whilst on said drugs.<br /><br />Such as.. Doing a speech at a country club dinner on shrooms and heroin<br /><br />Interviewing the DEA on drug policy under the guise of being a European media company whilst on LSD<br /><br />and attempting to approach and seduce women on crystal meth.<br /><br />That&#039;s not all the ideas I&#039;ve had but if I were to write an article it would basically be telling the story of how I came up with the idea and also as a plea for funding from any potential readers.<br /><br />Sound like it&#039;d work or not?
