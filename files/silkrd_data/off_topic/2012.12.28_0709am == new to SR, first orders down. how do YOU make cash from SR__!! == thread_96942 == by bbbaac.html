				hey i recently found out about SR, got some bitcoins and made my first orders. first thing i ordered was 50 speed pills (worked out to about 175 dollars, so around 3.75 each) not bad. hopefully gonna make some cash off those. second i ordered 2 oz. (worked out to about 304 dollars so like 150 an oz). hopefully gonna make some money off that too. <br /><br />i live in ontario canada. was wondering if anyone knows some legit vendors FOR WEED that have decent pricing. and our down to help you make money . ie good pricing. the more you buy the less you pay. <br /><br />even if they arent in canada still mention them if the pricing and quality of weed is good. <br /><br />i also want to find a good supplier for e pills. the prices i seen were lke 1.3 bitcoin for 1 pill so thats not very good. i am on here to make money. <br />would it be better to get a order of mdma and make my own pills ? <br /><br />let me know some vendors and how you have made some money off SR. <br /><br />ANY FEED BACK IS GOOD . THANKS <br /><br />BBBAAC!!<br /><br />

				I&#039;d recommend some M39 chronic if you&#039;re here to make money. Never tried it but apparently it&#039;s your commercial good weed, and SR has some decent prices for it. I&#039;ve seen it as low at $1950 per pound.

				thanks. i will look into that.&nbsp; :D i know some stuff is put on there so you cant make any money off it because its already almost a ridiculous price already. but some things i have seen are actually decent. i wonder how many people in my area use it to bring stuff in, make money with.
