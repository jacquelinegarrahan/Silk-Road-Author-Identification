				I just had my first breakthrough on DMT, indescribable on so many levels. I&#039;m a very happy being right now :D<br />I&#039;ve been trying so hard for the past week to no avail, today I figured eh, why not just embrace the OEV and listing to some music, as soon as I started smoking, vision shattered saw spiraling geometric figures headed towards me, bright with my eyes closed, see through with my eyes open. After that i felled smalled back into the couch and then I lost connect with my body and was just something floating right over my forehead watching weird spherical robotic being argue with the bigger machine that was carrying it about not playing with me as long as he had wanted to. I had strong auditory hallucinations too, no sounds I had ever heard in &quot;real&quot; life. I was ready to give up on the whole trying to breakthrough thing and decided to just roll em in joints and just enjoy the OEVs and CEVs but boy I was wrong! My body felt like that beings were holding it back while I popped into a bubble like sphere just over my head. I&#039;m blown away lol. Just thought I&#039;d share.

				Isn&#039;t it the most awesome experience ever? I remember the first time I broke through, it was as if I saw myself as just a human being for the first time.

Deep thought is not practiced much anymore, you don&#039;t need these types of substances to obtain these types of views. After &quot;meditating&quot; for hour(s) on a particular thought pattern and letting it follow it&#039;s course you will become privy to some of your most inner thoughts and truest ideas.<br /><br />Deep thought is something that can be attained after only 30 minutes when the mind has been trained to focus. But without first allowing yourself to let your own imagination astound itself, you will cannot naturally come to these reasonings. Most of the time my ideas from deep though aren&#039;t even the sentences themselves. It&#039;s the impression those random trains of thoughts leave on you and the new creative mass of images, groupings of things, and differing approaches to problems that will fuel future &quot;breakthroughs&quot;. Sometimes these come to me immediately after realizing what I just thought and leave as quickly as it came. <br /><br />This is why I always keep a 2.5&quot;x4&quot; moleskine plain page book around and a mini-pen I found at a yard sale. Never know when you will drift off for a few blocks of your life and what might come of it.

				I just got started on my DMT journey. I am having trouble gauging my proper amount without a proper mg scale and the fact that I smoke it in &quot;joints&quot;. It seems like I am not getting all of the smoked material into my lungs, lots ends up in the paper. Do you think it would be ok to make a lightbulb vape and just eyeball amounts or should I wait until I have a scale?<br /><br />Thanks, and I hope to break through someday soon.

But I mean that&#039;s just an non-DMT smoker trying to remember what one DMT smoker said.

				ENTITIES. MANY. POWERFUL INTENSE PIERCING GAZES TO THE DEPTHS OF MY SOUL.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve not met with them, and want to (eek), you must recognize what you&#039;re dealing with as far as D substance. If it&#039;s not so clear/crystal and is a little/lot yellow perhaps it may have more plant oils in it and the delivery won&#039;t be what you need to blast off to the top tier. <br /><br />I&#039;ve personally have always just placed flakes/crystals on top of bud bowl and I recommend taking the largest deepest possible hits you can. I have gotten it done in one, but that was where it completely disappeared in the bowl. If it&#039;s clean you may only need one massive dramatic hit! If the substance is darker or brownish it may be oxidized and not good product at all. (I&#039;m no chemist so if I&#039;m wrong here don&#039;t quote me). <br /><br />Listen to some terrence mckenna for the dmt trip experience from a D-advocate/connoisseur. <br /><br />I was blasted with elvish-serpent like entities imbedding themselves into my consciousness off my first single hit. I was hardly aware of the possibility of such an encounter before the experience. <br /><br />Happy tripping!

				Damn there were a lot of errors in that post, I guess I was still tripping lol. Thanks for all the comments guys!!<br /><br />I think joints + DMT sprinkled throughout the length will be my weapon of choice from now on. I can&#039;t for the life of me handle the freebase pipes, it is always waaayyyy too harsh for me for some reason.<br /><br />But um yea blue gears, slime flowing all on top, reptilian robot things, those are some of the other things I saw and it was amazing :D

				I just smoked some more, I dont know what classifies as a breakthrough but I just saw something intense. <br /><br />A black and purple geometric pattern slowly morphed into a man standing there, although it was all made of this purple and black pattern I felt like he was in formal attire. He was standing with his hands clasped behind his back like a general inspecting me. I felt him look right through me, all my worries, intentions, and insecurities I didn&#039;t even know I felt were laid out for him to see. The set and setting for this weren&#039;t idea as I could hear the neighbors talking and laughing with kids so that freaked me out. I panicked and pull off the eye cover I had put on for the trip. I was still tripping pretty hard but ran out of the room. <br /><br />It was intense and I plan to go back soon to find out who or what this man was.

I&#039;d describe it as returning to the womb for me, I just become enshrouded in this cocoon of warmth and love. One small trip I experienced not to long ago brought all of my fears to life though, everything I&#039;ve ever been afraid of was just sitting there in my room with me, yet they were all welcoming and not the least bit frightening. I&#039;ve literally faced my fears and realized I have nothing to be afraid of.<br /><br />Despite all of this, it still scares me shitless every time I prepare to smoke it. It just has that strong of a presence, especially since I get the feeling DMT can turn on you horribly if not respected. ;)

				DMT is not really appealing to me but my roommate convinced me to order some with him so I&#039;m gonna try it soon anyway, but I have one question about the qualitative experience that I think would give me the best understanding of whether my trepidation is valid or not.<br /><br />When you smoke dmt do you instantly forget that you just smoked dmt, and then eventually remember once you snap out of it?

				Had my first full breakthrough just a few weeks ago, have been using psychedelics and DMT for a little while, but absolutely nothing can prepare you, is an experience of an entirely different order of magnitude than one has ever experienced previously. I was smoking a new batch of DMT and I guess I was a bit laid back regarding dosage and took one big lungfull...felt an almost immediate powerful shift so set pipe down...then BOOOOM! I came to facing the other way (was lying down on bed) and it really felt like some very powerful alien force was trying to wrest control of my consciousness against my will. The fact that I had ingested a drug I think was unknown to me at the time, and if I had been told it would have seemed completely irrelevant. Not sure whether eyes were open or closed. The terror I experienced is far beyond any I have ever experienced. My life flashed before my eyes like an inter dimensional flip book, I was transported at light speed through memories, completely vividly, I was there, every bit as real and vivid as real life, many places at once, despite the fear there was this profound feeling of experiencing power and interconnectedness with the universe... absolutely the most magical, profound, alien, bizarre, and amazing experience of my life. Pretty far from a &#039;recreational&#039; one though! Feel incredibly lucky to have experienced it; has opened up my mind to new vistas and possibilities I could never have imagined before.

				The first time is almost incredible. I have some DMT sitting upstairs, but I&#039;m uneasy about it because of my incredibly intense breakthroughs, and the fact that I purged hard the last time I enjoyed the spice. I better give it a go soon.

But when you smoke DMT, I don&#039;t think you forget that you smoked it so much as you start to immediately forget all the intricacies and details of all the things you had just seen. It&#039;s as if there is too much that your mind just saw to be able to consolidate it into memory. Many liken it to dreaming and how once you wake up, you lose big pieces of your dream and have a hard time figuring out what it was all about.

				I think I had a semi-breakthrough today. Just want to share this with you.<br /><br />I felt this incredible calmness. I felt as I had risen to some other place yet I still saw my room and my arms. I was between two worlds. I heard the kids playing outside and I heard weird alien sounds. My whole room was alive. Everything was moving and almost floating.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the kicker. I felt something trying to connect with me consciously but I couldn&#039;t see anybody. When I closed my eyes I felt as I had opened my eyes in another world. No crazy patterns or anything like that. Except I saw a being observing me and carefully coming closer. I think it was floating. It doesn&#039;t even remotely assemble anything I&#039;ve seen before. I&#039;m not even sure if it was one being or multiple beings. It looked blue and like some kind of energy? It may have had multiple heads or not. It was floating towards and perhaps around me. It was observing and learning me. Maybe welcoming me?<br /><br />At the same time I felt something else connecting or observing me but it did not reveal itself. I felt them getting more distant and distant. I wanted to see what my room looked like so I opened my eyes and everything was still &quot;alive&quot;. It felt so weird being in my body. My arms had changed position without me knowing. I didn&#039;t recognize my own body. My arms were also glowing and sort of looked different. I felt warmness in some places of my body. I think my arms and the back of my head? Not so sure anymore.<br /><br />Gonna try again in a hour. Has anyone experienced something similar?

				The first time I had tried this, I resisted.. and fought back, it quickly became one of the most terrifying things i&#039;ve ever witnessed.

DMT was a lot more pleasant. Probably because I didn&#039;t break through though. Gotta find a better method of smoking. used a lightbulb and couldn&#039;t get there even after 8 hits with half a gram in there. I just felt sick from all the smoking.

				Just saw this post and I had to make a reply.&nbsp; I was introduced to DMT about 2-3 months ago here on SR.&nbsp; I have done my research on DMT through erowid, and have watched that DMT Documentary on Netflix.&nbsp; IDK why but I had a huge boner for psychedelics so I decided to make a DMT purchase.<br /><br />I have since then made MANY DMT purchases from SR and I probably won’t waste much time with other psychedelics anymore.&nbsp; DMT has hands down the most amazing, spiritual, Zen, calming, and meaningful trips I have ever experienced.&nbsp; The first purchase was changa and this was extremely easy to smoke and has a STRONG psychedelic trip.<br /><br />I just packed a dry bong up with the changa and gently lit the herb.&nbsp; Remember, DMT vaporizes at a very low temperature, so less fire is better.&nbsp; I slowly chalked it up, ever so gently pulling on the tube.&nbsp; I did this 2 times as quickly as I could.&nbsp; I like to think of smoking DMT as a 30 second window, you have 30 seconds to smoke as gently and as fast as you can, while holding in the smoke for at least 4 seconds.<br /><br />Soon as I put the bong down I started doing what I call “Phasing&quot;.&nbsp; It’s like I am this big instrumental gong and someone comes buy and strikes my center with the mallet causing an enormous ringing/vibration.&nbsp; These vibrations emit from my center EXTREMELY fast, yet with a warm glow like feeling.&nbsp; Anyways, I was kinda freaked out at first so I started fighting the trance like state by opening my eyes.&nbsp; This was when I remembered that I was looking to enjoy this and I couldn&#039;t help but to flash back to all the other times I had tripped on mushrooms or acid.&nbsp; Then, all of a sudden, this knowledge comes over me and I knew that all those experiences in the past were just preparing me for this moment.&nbsp; So tripping balls, I re-close my eyes.<br /><br />Upon doing so I saw the most beautiful entity of all.&nbsp; It was definitely female or at least she had that presence of it.&nbsp; She had six arms and was swaying to the music I had chosen for myself (Animus Vox - Glitch Mob).&nbsp; She was sitting cross legged over a stone slab and on the slab was the most intricate lines that where changing constantly.&nbsp; As I sat there I had MANY thoughts RAPIDLY shoot through my brain.&nbsp; I was thankful for the music because it was almost a reference to my reality/time.<br /><br />After enjoying her dance and me trying so hard to understand what it is I am seeing, I knew I was starting to come down.&nbsp; Longing to stay with the entity longer I just laid there with my eyes closed, literally laughing out loud and thanking her for such an amazing experience.&nbsp; This was my first experience with DMT.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a lot of visuals I can&#039;t really describe, because they go extremely fast.&nbsp; It seems we only remember the last little bit of it because like someone posted earlier, it is almost like our body treats the trip as a dream.<br /><br />This experience is not a breakthrough, although I felt it was when I did it, it really carried no meaning to me.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t until my 4-5th time I had a breakthrough and let’s just say I had a conversation with an inner entity through thoughts alone, meanwhile he was showing me shapes and designs that would appear from his hands in thin air.&nbsp; This was all with my eyes closed (friends told me) and I would have sworn they were open because I was THERE.<br /><br />I am sure I sound crazy, but I can assure you I am not.&nbsp; I am about to graduate University with a bachelor&#039;s in CIS and I consider myself a very down to earth person.&nbsp; In fact before my experiences with DMT I was Agnostic if not an Atheist.&nbsp; Soon after my experiences, I knew something was changing inside me.&nbsp; Every time I came back I knew that this place I perceived was something more than just a hallucination.&nbsp; It’s almost like that movie Inception, once I was awoken to this dimension, I have desired nothing more than to return again. <br /><br />I keep meaning to type up my next couple trips but it seems the first one is the most vivid in my head.&nbsp; I think it is because the changa had MAIO&#039;s, which allows for a longer, more memorable trip.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />All in all DMT is EXTREMELY powerful stuff.&nbsp; Even in the smallest doses, it can be the strongest trip you will ever experience.&nbsp; Although it is overpowering, it can be a very beautiful and spiritual adventure if you just let go and accept you have no control.&nbsp; I always look for an entity, there is always one somewhere, sometimes even hiding, but they are there to guide you through and show you the most beautiful things.&nbsp; I have never had a bad trip but I think you honestly have to be an evil hearted person to experience one.&nbsp; DMT shows you what you need to be shown, that&#039;s at least my take on it.<br /><br />Well I have wasted enough time re writing my 1st trip report LMAO, none the less I hope you all enjoyed my experience.&nbsp; If anybody has any questions please PM me.&nbsp; I LOVE to share in people’s thoughts and experiences.<br /><br />Sometimes we understand more, when we understand nothing at all.<br />
