				Mine is pretty tame. MDMA for the first time. Browsing the net, waiting for FX. Get distracted. Write a few emails. Completely forget that I had taken anything.<br /><br />Then BAM. Eyes wide, mouth agog - I FEEL FUCKING WONDERFUL. (oh yeah...) lol. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you can do better. Let&#039;s hear yours. :)

				How about taking something and it turning out to be not quite what you expected? One time I was commiting to a night o&#039; mdpv and had put out a bump of low grade mdpv on my glass. I ended up having to go see a guy about a thing. while I was away my brother unknowing of my plans cleaned the glass and threw down some 2-cb. Well, he ended up having to go see a guy about a thing. I returned after he had already left. long story short, I ended up inadvertently putting about 25mg of bees in my nose. Ten minutes later I realized something was amiss&nbsp; :o, after that my night plans needed adjusting haha. <br />We ended up establishing a new rule about powder management in the home after that little diversion..
