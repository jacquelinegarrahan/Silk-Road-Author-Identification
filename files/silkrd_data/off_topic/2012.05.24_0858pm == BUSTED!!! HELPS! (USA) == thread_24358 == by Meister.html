				So I had a half gram coming in the mail and it wasn&#039;t supposed to arrive until tomorrow or Saturday, but it CAME TODAY!!?! I knew something was up when I went to my PO and the hefty chick that&#039;s normally behind the counter wasn&#039;t there instead it was some burly dude who kept eye fucking me with his baby blues. <br /><br />I went to run for it before the swat team swooped in but when I turned around there was LE getting ready to bust me. It was some old chick rooting through her purse but I KNOW LE when I see them! That old bitch was packin and I knew I was goin to prison!! So I opened my half gram and threw some into her eyes and booked it out of there yelling LAWYER LAWYER LAWYER!<br /><br />So now I know I&#039;m in some shit, but do you guys think it&#039;ll be safe to go back in a few hours and see if my package is still laying on the floor somewhere?

				If your package is on the floor, make sure you pick it up and write &quot;Return to Sender&quot; on it.<br />&nbsp;;)
