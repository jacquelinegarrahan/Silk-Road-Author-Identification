				Hi!<br /><br />Long story short, a scammer paid with a check for some of my product. Obviously, the check bounced, it fact it was a closed checking account. <br />I would have never have accepted it hadn&#039;t it been someone who I knew pretty well back in High School and just met up again after 15 years. <br />She insisted that the money was good, the account was open, and that there wouldn&#039;t be any problems.<br />Well it turned out that the account was closed, there was no money, and after calling and texting her she is obviously giving me the run around and ducking me. <br />But guess what? I have her closed account numbers. I am not interested in money, but I am interested in doing something that would make her think twice before she did this to someone else. <br />If I can&#039;t get my money back , then you won&#039;t be able to keep it either, and will lose more than what you took.<br />I need some ideas... what do you think?

				I don&#039;t know of anything you can do with a closed account number. I doubt the bank would assist in with contact information for the person if you explained they wrote you a bad check from that account.<br /><br />I would start with Googling her name and other info, a valid whitepages listing and your options get considerably more interesting.

				I know where she lives, however I want to take an approach that would be less confrontational and less traceable to me.<br /><br />I was thinking of using these closed numbers and writing a check to someone (salvation army), putting it in her name. <br /><br />Just trying to garner some ideas

				Something isn&#039;t right about this whole story.&nbsp; Nobody does something like this...what&#039;s the point?&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be too obvious that you would get all this information, so writing a bad check doesn&#039;t make any sense.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t retaliate on something so idiotic and you should drop it.&nbsp; Sounds like something a 12 year old would do.

				&nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t drop anything if anyone, man or woman, stole from me. I understand the pacifists point of view, but it&#039;s far easier to tell someone else to act in such a way than it is to actually do it and constantly think about it for years. I&#039;ve been ripped off, or attempted to be ripped off, many times. The ones where I&#039;ve gotten back, they&#039;re out of my mind for the most part, yet it&#039;s the 2 separate occasions where I haven&#039;t had any recourse or payback that I constantly think about, many years after the fact.<br /><br />Unfortunately, physical violence, when thought through, is both far easier to get away with and has a less harsh penalty than even printing counterfeit checks.

				My point is, if you are in a war, you want to make sure you&#039;re killing the enemy, and not some kid just running thru the trash heap.
