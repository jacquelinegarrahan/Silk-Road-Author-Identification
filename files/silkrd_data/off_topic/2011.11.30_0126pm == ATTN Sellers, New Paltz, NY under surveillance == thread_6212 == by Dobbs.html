				http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111108/NEWS/111080333<br /><br />NEW PALTZ â€” The president of the New Paltz Board of Education was arrested Friday and charged with possession of 8 pounds of marijuana that police said he received through the mail.<br /><br />Kerr was charged on Friday with a single count of second-degree criminal possession of marijuana, a felony. He was released without bail.<br /><br />New Paltz cops and federal postal inspectors have been conducting an investigation into marijuana trafficking through the mail that resulted in the arrest of another New Paltz resident last week. Town police did not say if the two arrests were connected. Police Chief Joe Snyder could not be reached for further comment Monday.<br />

				I don&#039;t know lol.&nbsp; I do know that the New Paltz, NY PO and most likely the Gardiner, NY PO is under surveillance with a drug dog.&nbsp; Thought sellers could take this into consideration if they got an order there.&nbsp; It might not make it to their customers.&nbsp; And buyers in that area could maybe have their stuff shipped elsewhere for a while.&nbsp;

				Is New Paltz where the Mohonk Hotel is?<br /><br />Nice hotel. I stayed there for a week a few years ago. There&#039;s a university or college there isn&#039;t there? I suppose that&#039;s where this guy worked...

Due to the illegal nature of this practice there are no statistics on what percentage of drugs are sent through in the mail due to being purchased on SR, but I strongly believe that it would only make up 1% at the very, very most. People have been sending drugs through the mail since before the internet was even created, and they&#039;ll still do it if (Science forbid!) Silk Road is no longer in existence.

Lots of non-SR people traffic drugs through the mail.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I just had to give this a BIG +1. While it&#039;s impossible for me (or probably anyone else) to quantify the exact volume of SR or the drug trade at large, let&#039;s provide ourselves with some perspective about what and who we are. In reality, we&#039;re a small community, less than 250 sellers at this point. It seems reasonable to me that there are MANY MANY more people (I personally know several) who don&#039;t employe SR to send drugs, but use another method of communication like their god damn cell phones (ya know, that little tracking device most of us carry?), and if they&#039;re really being careful, a prepaid cell.<br /><br />Granted, there are two senators and probably many federal law enforcement officials that get massive hard-ons fantasizing about bringing us all down, primarily because of what we represent. But (generally speaking) we&#039;re not that big. We&#039;re also not using methods that are very easy for traditional law enforcement to combat, at least not using traditional narcotics interdiction methods. Narcotics interdiction, even at the federal level, generally consists of:<br /><br />1. Bust a suspect<br />2. Interview / terrify suspect<br />3. &quot;Flip&quot; suspect (Suspect becomes dirty snitch)<br /><br />SR makes that game a lot more difficult, because we don&#039;t know one another. I&#039;m not saying that is impossible for some sophisticated analytic techniques to be used to monitor bitcoin traffic and follow the money or issue subpoenas to various SR-related internet services etc, but it&#039;s definitely not routine police work, and it seems to me that building that type of a case would take a lot of resources and be at least a little bit more difficult to explain to a jury. If anyone has any credible, verifiable information about any substantial bust that has ever occurred due to the use of SR (with good or bad practices), I&#039;m extremely interested in hearing about it!<br /><br />From the sounds of it, this package was probably discovered in transit, and not at an endpoint. So here&#039;s another quote from this article that I think could bear repeating.<br /><br />&quot;Kerr had simply signed for the package and within seconds had been arrested.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s my opinion that requesting or providing a signature is EXTREMELY bad practice. Just let the god damn thing go, it is never worth it.<br /><br />Rocker

				8 pounds? that can&#039;t be SR surely, who would be dumb enough to send that in one go? I thought most &quot;professional vendors&quot; would split the orders, my guess is he probably gave a friend money to pay for it and mail it over to him.

				How can you say whether or not it was or wasn&#039;t?<br /><br />Chances are likely that it wasn&#039;t, solely based on the fact that, as someone mentioned above, SR only constitutes a small fraction of the mail-based drug trade. But how can you say it wasn&#039;t?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure plenty of people have received large amounts from SR vendors. I would presume it was after some regular contact, and was probably done a little outside the framework of the site, but it&#039;s certainly a feasible idea.<br /><br />That said, how do we even know the man received his weed from the mail at all? <br /><br />Officer: Sir, where did you get these illegal drugs?? Your friend? What&#039;s his name!!<br />Guy: Uh... I got it through the mail!

				In order for the cops to have a case they would need much more than someone just receiving it in the mail. They would need proof that you were expecting the package.<br /><br />Of course if they get a warrant and find it separated in to multiple bags, or any communication from your dealer you&#039;re fucked.
