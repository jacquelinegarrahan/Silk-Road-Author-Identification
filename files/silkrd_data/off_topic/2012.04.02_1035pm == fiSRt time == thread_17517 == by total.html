				Hi guys<br /><br />It is going to be my first time via SR. Have read thru the forum, bc are on their way to my SR account. <br /><br />No uppercase letters in the address, &quot;do not finalize before the delivery&quot; - these all seem understandable, if not logical. <br /><br />I wonder if there is anything I should pay special attention to. The suppliers all get mixed reviews, there is always someone who did not get the shipment and was not refunded.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, wanna take the risk, I wanted to go for theEmporium, because he is getting positive response, only then to realize as the 1st timer I do not qualify.<br /><br />Should I write all the candidate vendors first, or if someone does not make a disclaimer, he&#039;s good to sell to a newcomer?<br /><br />Thanks in advance

				I would message the vendors you&#039;re thinking about buying from first.&nbsp; Just ask them some basic questions.&nbsp; It&#039;s really just a way of introducing yourself and gives you the opportunity to present yourself as a legit customer and not some scammer.&nbsp; I have good stats, but I still like to message a vendor I&#039;ve never bought from before.<br /><br />I personally never finalize early.&nbsp; For my first transactions i purchased from vendors who welcomed newbies and didn&#039;t require early finalization.&nbsp; Depending on what you&#039;re looking to buy, you might have limited options. <br /><br />Be patient.&nbsp; Most people, once they figure out how everything on this site works, are so excited to place an order that they don&#039;t do all their homework as far as researching a vendor.&nbsp; A lot of people get scammed this way.<br /><br />It can take some digging to find a vendor that fits all the parameters of what you&#039;re looking for (product, pricing, shipping location, FE, etc), but you&nbsp; can usually get what you&#039;re looking for as long as you&#039;re patient.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				Thanks. I have posted 3 eu lsd vendors to see what happens. <br /><br />One of them offers escrow, which is said to be a big plus. <br />Unless there are other significant advantages of the others, I&#039;ll go for the escrow one.
