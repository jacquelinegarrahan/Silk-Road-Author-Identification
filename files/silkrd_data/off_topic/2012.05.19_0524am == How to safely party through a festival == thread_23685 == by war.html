				Although I am still working on my Nbome master thread I also want to start compiling this since festival season is here!<br /><br />To make this thread truly useful we need to figure out which drugs can be taken to accommodate 2-4 days of festival fun.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll start off with something basic and then update the thread once more input is given :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Festival Drugs of Choice<br /><br />MDMA<br />LSD<br />Methylone<br />Alchohol<br />Shrooms<br />Nbomes?<br />Ketamine<br /><br /><br />These are the only drugs I have considered using at festivals but will definitely add in other peoples favorites as well.<br /><br />MDMA and Methylone should have cross tolerance and LSD/ Shrooms should also have cross tolerance.<br /><br />The best I have figured out is<br /><br />Day 1 - Only Alchohol (This is boring and needs to be fixed)<br />Day 2 - MDMA/Methylone (Need to figure out dosages and times still if considering a 12 hour festival day)<br />Day 3 - LSD/Shrooms/Psychedelics <br /><br /><br />This is what I have done on festivals but I personally think there are ALOT of other ways to have WAY more fun.&nbsp; I also think it would be REALLY fun to take 25i at festivals but apparently with vasoconstriction it&#039;s a &quot;really bad idea&quot;<br /><br /><br />Looking forward to input from everyone :)

				aMT would probably be good, haven&#039;t tried it at a festival but it&#039;s got a nice duration and generally positive effects. Seems like it&#039;d go well with methylone too.<br />For vasoconstriction I take vitamin C + flavonoids and my MindFood capsules.

While I have witnessed and indeed been a part of some pretty wonky dance moves whilst under its influence, it also is a fucking blast. Just do small bumps incrementally and you should be a-ok :)

				Day 1 1.5-2grams/kilo MDMA sleep with Ambien/Lunesta (If trying to sleep at a different time then normal)<br />Day 2 LSD, a little higher than normal dosing <br />Day 3 2-2.5grams/kilogram MDMA with amphetamine<br />10mg of valium to gently bring you back to earth<br />

				as long as you dont get k holed you will feel a euphoric/drunk feeling thats quite nice. If you are not experienced with k it would be a bad idea. getting K holed at a fest would be a very bad idea lol.

				Added Ketamine to OP.&nbsp; Since at most festivals you can&#039;t bring alcohol inside what is your strategy on pregaming vs when to start taking drugs once inside?<br />

				If you do any more than a bump of K, make sure you&#039;re on something euphoric (MDMA recommended). I did 4.5 fat lines of K over some 6-8 hours and danced my ass off. I&#039;ve never K-Holed once even as everyone around me sank into the pit.<br /><br />Mindset, Willpower, and an Assist (if needed) will keep you out of the Hole.
