				&nbsp;I&#039;m sure this has been discussed billions of times but I placed an order and auto finalize Is In 2 days. As I&#039;m 99% sure I have been scammed, I took It to the resolution center asking for a refund. Well the vendor hasn&#039;t contacted me whatsoever, and just got a letter from SR stating &quot;One of your resolutions will be expiring soon. Please make any last efforts to reach an agreement, and be sure to submit any resolutions or statements you would like Silk Road administrators to consider.&quot; <br /><br />Not really sure what to do or where to go from here...

				When did you submit the resolution? The message about auto finalisation is automatic. It usually takes support a little while to get back to you. Submit your resolution ie extension or refund. Message the vendor. Why do you think you&#039;ve been scammed? If you haven&#039;t finalised you should be ok.

				I Submitted a resolution around 4 days ago. The reason I believe I&#039;ve been scammed Is due to recent feedback given on the vendor. Same thing happening to me seems to be happening to everybody else who made a purchase from this vendor. Vendor won&#039;t respond to ANYBODY&nbsp; from what I&#039;ve read, there seller rating has dropped 2% the last couple days, Numerous 1/5 ratings. Is It to late to contact support? If not how would I go about It, I&#039;ve asked them for a refund OR an extension and still heard nothing back. I also have a second order with them a few days from auto finalization so I;d like to get It sorted out with the SR staff since the vendor Isn&#039;t doing anything. Thanks

				You submitted your resolution through the resolution center not through &quot;contact support&quot;, right?&nbsp; Just want to be sure.<br /><br />What % refund did you ask for?<br /><br />I think you can put in another request for resolution even if you&#039;ve already placed one that is pending.&nbsp; Ask for a 100% refund and put in the information you&#039;ve mentioned here.

				Agreed. You should hopefully get reimbursed. Was it an expensive order?

				Both orders were around $240, not alot for most people on here but to me sadly It Is.With the first order I click the resolve button under &quot;orders&quot; and asked for a 100% refund, explaining why I felt I deserved this. I should have done more research here but I&#039;m new and still learning. My question Is, If the vendor does not respond to my resolution within 2 days (which Is when FE) will auto finalize still go on my stats and will I still lose my money? I feel retarded for not looking Into this sooner

				Hi imghost9,<br /><br />Does the vendor list estimated shipping times to your country on their homepage? Also, do they have a T&amp;C that mentions a refund/re-ship policy? If so, you may want to decide what to do using that... <br /><br />That automated message seems to cause so much confusion... it&#039;s sent after 10 days, which is fine in your order doesn&#039;t have to go through customs anywhere, I guess... but, for example, recently I have waited 23 days for orders from Spain and UK.&nbsp; nbd because I expected it (I do lots of research before placing orders), but it&#039;s very easy to extend days in the RES Center :) and if the vendor doesn&#039;t agree (or doesn&#039;t respond), then the staff will eventually make a decision for you. Maybe based on the vendor&#039;s T&amp;C, but usually they just add days, I think.<br /><br />Hope this helps somewhat!<br />TB<br /><br />PS: $240 sounds like a BIG order to me!
