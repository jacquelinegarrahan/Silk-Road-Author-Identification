				ha ha, better put on my tin foil top hat! but seriously if a government were to be doing something like this then surely they would pick a more prevalent drug, acid isnt something that most people take regularly or that large numbers of people use compared to say coke, weed or the easiest of all to hide a compound in, pills of any sort. also there arent that many chemicals that are actually active at doses small enough to fit on blotter paper.

				- its unlikely any gov / DEA would produce LSD for monetary reasons alone its profitable but hard work...<br /><br />- aren&#039;t the brainwashing sessions necessary, being under the influence of whatever drug just puts them in another state of mind or more accepting of these foreign<br />&nbsp; ideas....otherwise you&#039;re just high, and since I doubt many of us waste the time watching telly news and adverts seems unlikely &quot;they&quot; are achieving much brainwashing.<br /><br />- it is very possible there are government run / funded labs producing it -again this would have to be for the purpose on infiltrating an organisation, otherwise LE could<br />&nbsp; use confiscated gear or even blank sheets to set someone up; but why LSD there are far more accessible drugs to use....its not clear to me...so unlikely to be<br />&nbsp; significant.<br /><br />

				Sorry for the long post, interesting read.<br />Full version @ hxxp://www.sfweekly.com/2012-03-14/news/cia-lsd-wayne-ritchie-george-h-white-mk-ultra/<br /><br />It&#039;s been over 50 years, but Wayne Ritchie says he can still remember how it felt to be dosed with acid.<br /><br />He was drinking bourbon and soda with other federal officers at a holiday party in 1957 at the U.S. Post Office Building on Seventh and Mission streets. They were cracking jokes and swapping stories when, suddenly, the room began to spin. The red and green lights on the Christmas tree in the corner spiraled wildly. Ritchie&#039;s body temperature rose. His gaze fixed on the dizzying colors around him.<br /><br />The deputy U.S. marshal excused himself and went upstairs to his office, where he sat down and drank a glass of water. He needed to compose himself. But instead he came unglued. Ritchie feared the other marshals didn&#039;t want him around anymore. Then he obsessed about the probation officers across the hall and how they didn&#039;t like him, either. Everyone was out to get him. Ritchie felt he had to escape.<br /><br />He fled to his apartment and sought comfort from his live-in girlfriend. It didn&#039;t go as planned. His girlfriend was there, but an argument erupted. She told him she was growing tired of San Francisco and wanted to return to New York City. Ritchie couldn&#039;t handle the situation. Frantic, he ran away again, this time to the Vagabond Bar where he threw back more bourbon and sodas. From there, he hit a few more bars, further cranking up his buzz. As he drank his way back to Seventh and Mission, Ritchie concocted a plan that would change his life.<br /><br />Now in his mid-eighties and living in San Jose, Ritchie may be among the last of the living victims of MK-ULTRA, a Central Intelligence Agency operation that covertly tested lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on unwitting Americans in San Francisco and New York City from 1953 to 1964.<br />&quot;I remember that night very clearly, yes I do,&quot; he said in a recent interview. &quot;I was paranoid. I got down to where I thought everyone was against me. The whole world was against me.&quot;<br />After the day had bled into night on Dec. 20, 1957, Ritchie returned to his office in the Post Office Building and retrieved two service revolvers from his locker. He was going rogue.<br /><br />&quot;I decided if they want to get rid of me, I&#039;ll help them. I&#039;ll just go out and get my guns from my office and hold up a bar,&quot; Ritchie recalls. &quot;I thought, &#039;I can get enough money to get my girlfriend an airline ticket back to New York, and I&#039;ll turn myself in.&#039; But I was unsuccessful.&quot;<br />Out of his skull on a hallucinogen and alcohol, Ritchie rolled into the Shady Grove in the Fillmore District, and ordered one final bourbon and soda. After swallowing down the final drops, he pointed his revolver at the bartender and demanded money. Before joining the marshals, Ritchie served five years in the Marines and spent a year as an Alcatraz prison guard. But the cop had suddenly become the robber.<br /><br />It was over in a flash. A waitress came up behind him and asked Ritchie what he was doing. When Ritchie turned around, a patron hit him over the head and knocked him unconscious. He awoke to a pair of police officers standing over him. Ritchie says he had expected to get caught or killed.<br /><br />The judge went easy on him and Ritchie avoided prison. He resigned from the Marshals Service, pleaded guilty to attempted armed robbery, paid a $500 fine, and was sentenced to five years&#039; probation.<br />Ritchie&#039;s story is certainly peculiar, but not unique. Other San Franciscans were unsuspecting participants in a strange research program in which the government effectively broke the law in an effort to fight the Cold War.<br /><br />Seymour Hersh first exposed MK-ULTRA in a New York Times article in 1974 that documented CIA illegalities, including the use of its own citizens as guinea pigs in games of war and espionage. John Marks expertly chronicled more of the operation in his 1979 book, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate. There have been other reports on the CIA&#039;s doping of civilians, but they have mostly dished about activities in New York City. Accounts of what actually occurred in San Francisco have been sparse and sporadic. But newly declassified CIA records, recent interviews, and a personal diary of an operative at Stanford Special Collections shed more light on the breadth of the San Francisco operation.<br /><br />There were at least three CIA safe houses in the Bay Area where experiments went on. Chief among them was 225 Chestnut on Telegraph Hill, which operated from 1955 to 1965. The L-shaped apartment boasted sweeping waterfront views, and was just a short trip up the hill from North Beach&#039;s rowdy saloons. Inside, prostitutes paid by the government to lure clients to the apartment served up acid-laced cocktails to unsuspecting johns, while martini-swilling secret agents observed their every move from behind a two-way mirror. Recording devices were installed, some disguised as electrical outlets.<br /><br />To get the guys in the mood, the walls were adorned with photographs of tortured women in bondage and provocative posters from French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The agents grew fascinated with the kinky sex games that played out between the johns and the hookers. <br />The two-way mirror in the bedroom gave the agents a close-up view of all the action.<br />The main man behind the mirror was burly, balding crime-buster George H. White, a Bureau of Narcotics maverick who made headlines breaking up opium and heroin rings in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the U.S. Few knew he doubled as a CIA spook for Uncle Sam. He oversaw the San Francisco program, gleefully dubbing it Operation Midnight Climax.<br /><br />&quot; was a real hard head,&quot; said Ritchie, who regularly ran into him in courtrooms and law enforcement offices in downtown San Francisco. &quot;All of his agents were pretty much afraid to do anything without his full approval. White would turn on them, physically. He was a big tough guy.&quot;<br />American chemist Sidney Gottlieb was the brains behind White&#039;s brawn. It was the height of McCarthyism in the early &#039;50s, and government intelligence leaders, claiming fear of communist regimes, were using hallucinogens to induce confessions from prisoners of war held in Korea, and brainwash spies into changing allegiances. What better way to examine the effects of LSD than to dose unsuspecting citizens in New York City and San Francisco?<br /><br />The mind-bending laboratory on Telegraph Hill was called &quot;the pad&quot; in White&#039;s leather-bound journals. White&#039;s widow donated 10 boxes of his personal effects to Foothill College in Los Altos Hills after he died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1975. Now warehoused at Stanford, the journals, letters, and photographs provide a window into the mischievous life of a secret agent during the Cold War.<br />Before White joined the narcotics bureau, he worked in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a World War II-era intelligence agency that preceded the CIA. In a quest for truth serums, White and other OSS agents slipped concentrated tetrahydrocannabinol acetate (THCA) into the food and cigarettes of suspected communists, conscientious objectors, and mobsters in the 1940s. The experience wasn&#039;t a prerequisite for working in MK-ULTRA, but it helped.<br />Dr. James Hamilton, a Stanford Medical School psychiatrist, knew White from their OSS days. He was among the small group of researchers who had clearance to the pad. Gottlieb visited, too, but Operation Midnight Climax had no regular medical supervision. And that became problematic. The first CIA brothel that White and Gottlieb ran in New York City had already gone awry. U.S. biological warfare specialist Frank Olson either jumped or was pushed from a 10th-floor hotel window in 1953, nine days after the CIA gave him LSD. When a CIA chemist, who was sharing the hotel room with Olson, met with police, they found White&#039;s initials and the address of a Greenwich Village safe house on a piece of paper in his pocket. The New York City operation was temporarily suspended when police investigated Olson&#039;s death, and restarted later.<br />White, a native Californian and former San Francisco newspaper reporter, yearned to return home. In 1955, Gottlieb let him.<br /><br />Aside from Gottlieb&#039;s scattershot visits, White, now a &quot;CIA consultant,&quot; had free rein over the S.F. safe houses. Ritchie says that White&#039;s right-hand man, Ike Feldman, ran around dressed like &quot;a hot-shot drug dealer.&quot; Ritchie adds: &quot;He tried to act like Al Capone.&quot; The pad quickly became something akin to a frat house for spies. &quot;Eight-martini lunches&quot; were enjoyed regularly, White noted in his journal. And on some occasions he watched the dubious research unfold while sitting on a portable toilet a friend donated to him. It was his &quot;observational post.&quot;<br />What went on in the pad, apparently stayed in the pad.<br />Dr. John Erskine has lived next door to the location since 1954. &quot;I had a feeling that things went on there that were none of my business. It wasn&#039;t overt. People weren&#039;t screaming out the windows,&quot; says Erskine, standing outside the acid house. The property is undergoing renovation. Just a few months ago, a construction crew pulled microphones, wires, and recording instruments out of the walls.<br /><br /><br /><br />
