				so i will be attending a festival later in the summer, and it would be my first one. <br />basically here is the situation. I have a couple ideas for sneaking stuff in and what drugs I should do. I just need someones opinion. <br />day 1 = 2cb, weed <br />day 2= mdma or lsd, weed <br />day 3 = (depending on what I do on day 2) mdma or lsd, weed, cocaine (for energy) <br /><br />I dont want to be completely shot for the 3rd day so thats why for the cocaine. would shrooms be a good environment during a festival?&nbsp; <br />I want THE most energy for day 2, (my favorites are playing then) <br />can you roll two days in a row? <br /><br />and for sneaking in... I have this little petri dish thing around 2&#039;&#039; . it looks like a bigger container for bho wax. <br />I was going to stick my stuff in there and tape it to my scrotum. I dont want the cid to evaporate. my only fear are drug dogs and for the dish to fall out while being inspected. <br />also for the weed. I was going&nbsp; to grind a shit ton up and stuff it in one of those dishes and tape it in the same area too. I would love to have blunts but that it impossible. what about a one hitter, joints, bowls? <br />is there anyway to reseal cigarette packs? <br />thanks!

				This is the epitome of first world problems. Lol<br />Have you thought about switching cocaine for amphetamine. It&#039;s more suitable or a festival because you won&#039;t need to have more every 30 minutes. Speed lasts 6+ hours.<br />And you can take it multiple days in a row without being too unhealthy.<br /><br />IMO this would be a good plan, because day 1 you won&#039;t need any stimulants because you will not be very tired. You will be on day 2 and 3.<br /><br />Day 1: LSD / hallucinogenic<br />Day 2: MDMA and use weed for comedown.<br />Day 3: Amphetamine. Possibly with alcohol or weed. But you will need A LOT more weed or alcohol than normal. SO be careful you don&#039;t drink too much. The Amphetamine is so powerful and it kills off the downer effects from the alcohol &amp;/or weed quickly.<br /><br />If you ever have too much stimulants, have 0.5mg xanax.<br /><br />But don&#039;t mix stimulants because unless you are experienced with them, you will find yourself having far too much energy for your own good.

				OP - you shouldnt roll multiple days in a row, as this can do serious damage to your serotonin re-uptake receptors (not to say I havent done it a few times).&nbsp; I think your lineup is good, consider swapping 2c for lsd on day one, then stick with mdma day 2 for your favorite acts.<br /><br />holy shit i feel bad for you aussies.&nbsp; Ive only gotten caught sneaking drugs into a festival once, and it wasnt hidden at all (just sitting in my wallet - bad idea on my part).&nbsp; Ive also never seen any dogs at a festival.&nbsp; Ill be sneaking in my first bulk package into a festival soon, so hopefully Ill be successful.&nbsp; If anyone has any particularly good stealth ideas, please do PM me :D

				I got a pair of skate shoes with a hidden zipper in the tongue. I can remove the foam insert and then have a space with enough room to fit ~50 size 00 capsules per shoe. All the festivals/clubs Ive been to in America havnt had dogs. If they did I definitely wouldnt use this technique, or would at least just have it mylar bagged and sell by the gram.

				Do a search and you&#039;ll find quite a few threads on this.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my guide a posted in another thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95420.msg677208#msg677208">Quote from: Drippy on December 22, 2012, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) How to get it in &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Getting what you need into the festival grounds will be the easy part.&nbsp; Generally for any size of festival besides very small local ones, they&#039;ll have a quick car search.&nbsp; Their sole purpose in this is to make sure you don&#039;t have any glass or wood from off the property (has to do w/ insects/diseases that put their trees at risk).&nbsp; Just make sure you don&#039;t stash anything in the cooler, and chances are they won&#039;t even come close to finding it.&nbsp; You really have to play it by ear, but worst case scenario if I see they&#039;re ripping apart cars I&#039;ll often just get out and walk to the ticketing area.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95420.msg677003#msg677003">Quote from: opensky on December 22, 2012, 08:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you know the festival ground well, it is not too difficult to sneak in. <br /><br />Wired fences in the way? Metal plyers solve that easily. Quick way to get free admission and your stuff into the grounds no problem...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would absolutely NOT suggest sneaking in if you plan on vending unmentionables, unless you have a plan for getting a wristband or (preferably if you&#039;re a pro) credentials for VIP/vending/press/artist/staff/production.&nbsp; Having anyone w/ any sort of authority catch you w/o a wristband/laminate/sticky is just asking to be searched.&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting what you need into the concert area (if you&#039;re at a larger festival that has security between the stages and camping) is where things get a little more difficult.<br /><br />1. ALWAYS smile, and NEVER do anything to suggest that your time is being wasted by the 300lb dude cupping your balls in search of a flask of apple pie.&nbsp; They&#039;re working while everyone else is partying, so anything you can do to make them feel like they&#039;re a part of the party vs being the person trying to harsh your mellow helps<br /><br />2. My GOLDEN RULE is to show them you&#039;ve done this before and have nothing to hide by removing everything from your pockets (I like to throw everything in my hat and hold it in front of me), and if you&#039;re wearing a backpack have it in front of you with all the pockets open.&nbsp; If you have a hoody or something in there they&#039;re going to have to remove to search you, remove it for them and drape it over your arm.&nbsp; Anything you can do to speed up the process and show them you know you&#039;re about to get searched up and down is going to make it a lot less likely that they scrutinize your bag/pockets.&nbsp; Often I&#039;ll see the people in front of me get their shit RIPPED apart, and then when I walk up w/ everything presented in front of me ready to go I just get waved by w/ hardly even a glance into my bag.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use obvious/well-known places like your shoe, tucked in your belt, or openly in your hat.&nbsp; If you have a Grassroots hat w/ a secret pocket I&#039;d also be wary of using that, as security has caught onto that after 4yrs of that crew running around festivals lol.&nbsp; Secret pockets in backpacks, underwear, belts, shoes, etc are a good idea as long as they&#039;re well placed and well constructed.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use a pocket w/o a zipper and risk losing product just b/c it&#039;s a sly spot.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest against using battery compartments in flashlights as they often get checked, but usually cameras are ok (make sure you have press credentials if it&#039;s a DSLR though).&nbsp; Generally security doesn&#039;t want to touch your expensive camera, but they&#039;ll rip apart the $5 flashlight you have sitting by itself at the bottom of your bag.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to refrain from going over some of my more stealth methods publicly, but just use your head and you&#039;ll be able to think of a million sly spots to stash stuff.&nbsp; If security allows flags/blow-up toys and whatnot that&#039;s a good place to start brainstorming, especially if you&#039;re trying to get something bulky in like weed.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Who to sell to/where to sell/how to avoid LE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This will largely depend on your friend group attending the festival.&nbsp; Obviously it&#039;s always MUCH safer to only deal w/ friends of friends who are referred, but some people justify the risk of working w/ strangers is worth the reward.&nbsp; I generally will never mention anything to strangers, unless I&#039;ve spent a few minutes chatting w/ them already and can tell they&#039;re on the level.&nbsp; If you do decide to sell to complete strangers...<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Don&#039;t yell like many people have suggested already in the thread - feel like this should be common sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; Don&#039;t be that shirtless sweaty rolling bro that darts through the crowd super fast whispering &quot;flame molly, WoW family fluff needle point&quot; into people&#039;s ears.&nbsp; It&#039;s creepy, and it won&#039;t attract the heads who know how this system works and will make transactions run smooth, but rather the first time fest goer who was just openly yelling asking if anyone had seen their sister molly or lucy a moment ago.&nbsp; I always prefer to have a very brief conversation w/ a group of kids that look cool, and then casually ask if they&#039;re doing good on [insert whatever I have here] tonight.&nbsp; More personal interactions make people feel much more comfortable, and give you a chance to briefly evaluate your future clientele before even mentioning anything.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; For something that samples are often asked for, have a little tool (mini coke spoon, key, etc) to hand a small sample that YOU&#039;VE measured out of a bag other than the one you&#039;re selling out of.&nbsp; Do NOT just hand people you don&#039;t know gram of moon rocks and expect them not to take a point rock as a &quot;tester&quot; then not buy anything.&nbsp; Generally I just prefer to say &quot;I&#039;ll stand here while you take a dip of what you buy, and if you don&#039;t like it you can punch me in the face&quot; instead of giving out samples.&nbsp; If they&#039;re not ok w/ that, then they were probably just looking for a free dip anyways. <br /><br />4)&nbsp; As I rule of thumb I will NEVER, regardless of whether I&#039;m selling to strangers or not, do business w/ someone who approaches me.&nbsp; Instead, only work w/ those who you&#039;ve approached.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if they have dreads and are rocking some limited release flatbrim w/ GDF wings on it and a $5000 wrap around their neck - kids who know what&#039;s up are NOT going to be asking randoms for drugs at a festival.&nbsp; Undercovers are not limited to people hired to do that at the festival.&nbsp; Often LE will get kids busted to flip on others by having them run around trying to find drugs while they follow them, watch the transaction, and then bust both of you (then obviously separate you and let the other guy go w/o charges).<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Try to do the majority of your business during the day and within the camping area.&nbsp; This eliminates a lot of the undercover presence, as generally undercovers are in the concert bowl looking for dumbasses, not sitting at a campsite smoking a bowl w/ a bunch of other wooks.&nbsp; Besides, you should be enjoying your festival and getting down to music at night.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; Space out the exchange of money and drugs - do one first, wait 30sec-1min, then do the other.&nbsp; Change of hands w/ a small something followed by change of hands the opposite direction w/ a wad of cash is what LE is looking for, and they generally won&#039;t do anything if they don&#039;t see money handed off right away.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; Do NOT sell drugs at your own campsite to people you don&#039;t know.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need word getting around that you&#039;re the man in the area w/ the fire shard, and that your tent is &quot;right over there ::points at tent::&quot;.<br /><br />8)&nbsp; I would highly suggest have a cheap wirelocked safe well-hidden in a car that you can drop stacks of cash off in.&nbsp; It&#039;s not gonna stop someone who&#039;s determined, but is enough deterrent to keep your friends girlfriend from trying to pluck a couple bucks off your stack when she goes back to the car to get sunscreen.&nbsp; Putting a luggage lock on your tent is NOT going to deter anyone, so have a plan as to how money and excess product will be stashed.&nbsp; However, keep in mind the melting point of whatever you have and how hot your car is going to get.&nbsp; Also, make sure there is a backup key or two w/in your crew for when one of you inevitably loses theirs.<br /><br />9) For powder drugs, keep quantity stashed in something that absorbs moisture if it&#039;s going to be humid.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen ounces of cocaine basically ruined for the time being at festivals before.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and update this w/ any other info I think of, and feel free to pick my brain about anything I haven&#039;t mentioned.<br /><br />Cheers! -Drippy<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Good bunch of tips Drippy, +1. Also I&#039;ll add my ideal way of selling.<br />3 people, 1 with drugs, 1 with money and 1 who sells product. The guy who is selling only ever has ~$200 worth of product + money combined value. Once he sells out, he gives the money to the money guy then goes and gets product from the product guy. Then if all else fails your group will always have the money as there is no way that guy is getting caught as he does nothing illegal. If the sell guy gets caught, he quickly empties his pockets and runs into the crowd. With MDMA, the $200 worth of product if selling .2g for $20 thats only 2g, aka $40 lost product based on SR prices. So, nothing really to be worried about.

				If you&#039;re really desperate, you could get an iPhone and open it up. remove the battery and put drugs in there.<br />You need a screw driver to open it up though. So perhaps attach a tiny screw driver onto your key ring and bring it in. <br /><br />That&#039;s pretty much a last resort. The chances of them opening up an iPhone is pretty much zero.<br />Othe phones may work too, but a lot of them have covers which come off very easily.<br />

I have a few responses and an anecdote.<br /><br />4) Last festival I was at I was talking to this older dude, maybe 40 or so. He seemed to be an old time dead head. He was saying that he just got out of federal prison (5 years) a few months ago. Allegedly the feds were chasing him across state lines and followed him for 11 states. He had a really nice silver wrap and I was talking to him about getting one made for me...... Then this girl I had met came over, it was her birthday so I handed her a tin foil packet of 120mg MDMA (4sale) as a gift. She walked off after saying thanks. This dude instantly was like oh what do you have ect..... I was candy flipping fairly hard, and it was my first time too. He got me to come back to his campsite to talk business and hugged me and shit saying he was family and all. Showed me his &quot;GDF wings tattoo&quot; I didn&#039;t think that was weird some people are like that, especially at this smaller festival. As we came into his camp site he handed me a one hitter packed up, I hit it and passed it back and then he hit it. And he started asking what was up with the molls and shit. I mentioned a price or two and he started visually getting excited (tightly squeezing handfuls of leaves, breathing heavily, ect...) and I mean like overly excited. <br /><br />He actually said &quot;I can get how much for how much?, what for what?, what is IT again?&quot; <br /><br />and thats when the alarm bells in my opened mind started going the fuck off. He started showing me all this shit he could trade. None of which was illegal, a Kite with LED&#039;s on it, glow sticks, LED poy things shit like that. At this point his silver wrap hanging off his chest started warping into a Police Badge, the visuals were hella strong.<br /><br />At that point I took of my sunglasses and looked him in the eye and he just sat there and looked back and asked how much it cost again. I felt like I could read his mind, I thought I was about to get arrested. I didn&#039;t have shit on me I keep it in the car, and I NEVER reveal what I drive.<br /><br />Then I came up with a plan. I was like &quot;Ok let me go get the MDMA and the scale and I&#039;ll come back over here and we&#039;ll get you sorted out.&quot; I did not go back there.<br /><br />Crazy thing was I sold .75 to this one dude that seemed pretty straight, and he was hustling that back out at like 150 a g by the point. And as we were chilling that old dude came over dapped him and they knew each other. So IDK what the fuck was up. Maybe I just sketched out and was tripping to hard (2 JOR bikes, and a Ninja Turtle), or maybe he was LE. I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know if people can get out of jail early in exchange for becoming a CI. But if you can I could easily see some scum bag doing 5 years, and being like &quot;Yea let me work this festival or two I&#039;ll get you cases.&quot; Its hella easy to get cases at a festival where everyone is on drugs......<br /><br />5) At the festival I have in mind nearly every arrest related to a CI or an undercover is in the camping area. Its also where the dealing goes on.<br /><br />7) I offered MDMA to my neighbors and they said &quot;Oh its you that has it!, there was this dude with an LED hoola hoop that was over here telling people you had shit&quot; my immediate fear was it was that older dude. Anyway I sold it to em&#039; and it was straight. But yes this is an important one. Don&#039;t sell at your campsite.<br />&nbsp;<br />I usually find who ever is already out there working the show, wait till they run out of shit and then offer them MDMA at 50 a g, for quarter or something. Leave them some profit margin and let them do the dirty work. If they don&#039;t have the cash for a whole Q I&#039;ll sell them and only them 50 a g, for as many g&#039;s as they want. Gives you a layer against LE. I always keep the shit in my car and go get it once a deal is struck. And you better believe I watch my back and verify I am not being followed. If I think I am I don&#039;t go to the car, I just walk back in the gates (haven&#039;t had to do that yet, but thats the plan). Its all a shell game. Don&#039;t let them know where your campsite is or your car. And do not mention what kind of car it is. I know when you drive something cool it can be tempting to talk about it, but save that shit for those sexy females :)

				yall are overthinking it entirely. go buy you a vac sealer and vac seal all your shit up. unroll your tent and put all your shit tucked into the tent and reroll it up and pack it neatly back into the tent case. if you have a tent that is boxed up, you can even take the necessary precautions to tape the box back up, making it looked like it was never opened.

				dude wondercow what show you talking about going to? because if your at a festival you shouldnt be having to go through such extremes to get shit in. i would walk through security with a king size joint in my mouth ready to light up and as long as i didnt have glass on me i was fine haha. <br /><br />if your talking about a venue type deal, is it really worth all the trouble? why not pregame before you go in. imagine going to jail for smoking a joint at a show. fuck that

This happened to my friend, we got busted my security smokin a bowl in the stands of a big event.....he had 50 pills in his pocket. the security were holding us by 1 of our arms and as soon as his foot stepped of the bleacher stairs and onto the dirt......he bolted and barely had enough time to bring his stash from procket to tighties (he was using the same method) then security tackled him. I got kicked out too but not searched (i had nothing) when I left the entrance&nbsp; I could see him against the wall and PD had him and was searching him. didnt check inside his underwear and let him go even tho he was obviously rolling face. lol. then it turned into a late night search for whippets on hollywood blvd. Ahh those were the days lolz

				In terms of selling, what about this for a tactic: Offer people dabs of a bag of a non-illicit substance (salt, sugar, creatine, whatever) telling them its the goodies.&nbsp; A CI cant (under most circumstances) actually consume any drugs, they just buy them.&nbsp; This way, youre ensuring that whoever is sticking their finger in your bag isnt LE or associated with LE.&nbsp; After they lick their finger and say hey this tastes different, you offer them a real dip (or whatever sample your wares happen to be).<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I can&#039;t tell you much about the drugs and their effects as I&#039;m not a big user. But as for stealth, of course it is better to be prepared and the saying applies &quot;better safe than sorry&quot;. However it really isn&#039;t that hard to get gear in. I know someone who got a shit load of pills in just through having them in a plastic sandwich bag at the bottom of an opaque yazoo milkshake bottle. They were drinking the milkshake as they passed into the festival and nobody thought to check it. Also going in with big crowds will make you more suspicious, so it&#039;s best to roll in on your own or with a buddy and meet up with your gang later on. Hope this is of any help.
