				As the subject says I got some pills from Supertrips. I got them because a few of my friends wanted them so I bought 10 of them for a good price and split them. I held on to a couple, even though I never really got into ecstasy like any of my friends did, but I&#039;ve been a pothead for a long while now and love psychedelics.<br /><br />I&#039;m debating on taking one or maybe just a half a pill. I&#039;m not into raves or even parties or bar hopping much. I was debating on taking it more for therapeutic purposes.<br /><br />Anyone have any suggestions on this? I was planning to take one after everyone in the house is asleep and just listen to music and maybe playing some videogames. Would this be a good idea? Anything I should take into consideration before I wash one of these down?<br /><br />Any suggestions/comments are more than welcome.

				It depends on which particular pill you bought from ST. Is it the 120mg ones, or the 200mg one? For a first time, your typical dosage should be 100 mg (unless you are &lt;75KG in which case 80 would be good). You will SERIOUSLY enjoy it. Seriously.<br /><br />You might not want to do it alone. While I&#039;m sure there are many who enjoy rolling alone, there&#039;s just a spirit of camaraderie and together-ness that binds people who are flying high. Think about all your pot buddies, all the people you enjoy hanging out with getting high. Now multiply that awesome closeness by 100 and mix in some killer Electronic Dance Music. That&#039;s how epic it can be. My first time I tried it, I was extremely glad to be around thousands of people feeling music coursing through my very soul.<br /><br />The first time is always the MOST magical, just like LSD. You COULD do it alone... but you SHOULD have a Plan E ready. Plan E would be going out to a kickass club playing awesome new music (EDM baby) that you can dance to with a couple of friends who are rolling with you. Buy a pack of menthol cigarettes (as mentholy as you can get it&#039;s sooo goooood), and get a bunch of water to drink. Don&#039;t do alcohol, don&#039;t smoke weed, don&#039;t take anything other than water. Split a pill to start, finish the other half 3 hours in. You need friends because talking is awesome and partying is even better.<br /><br />MDMA is a social drug. Do it with people! There are many many guides on the forums on what to do high. I&#039;ve outlined some basics (1 pint of water an hour is good) so do some research if you want to really roll hard.

				i was going to say id definitely recommend you do it surrounded by some good friends or a lover...<br /><br />i see you taking it alone and either crawling into bed with your partner and eventually waking them up to tell them how much you love them and offer a massage or calling all your friends super early in the morning and waking them up because you just want to talk and tell them how great everything is including them :P

				Thanks for the info.<br /><br />Unfortunately being around my partner is probably out of the question, because other than weed she gets sketched out when I take anything. She&#039;s ok with me doing it as long as she isn&#039;t there and I stay safe. I can&#039;t have her around when I trip anymore because of this. She gets freaked which in turn freaks me out and all hell breaks loose in my mind.<br /><br />I would love to have going to a club as an option, but I live in the middle of fucking nowhere. My friends who normally roll live hours away from me so it isn&#039;t easy. I could hold off and make plans to go out with them if I can make arrangements to have a place to crash and all I guess, but it all seems such a hassle just for a pill.

				Once you&#039;ve used stimulants for a while, you can actually have a really good time on your own, surfing the web, listening to/playing music etc. <br /><br />But for the first few times, it&#039;s definitely better to be around people you enjoy hanging out with and rolling together. You don&#039;t even have to be at a club or bar, just being in the same room talking and putting on some music can be a real cool experience.

				mate do it,youll have such a time...i wouldnt advise taking it on your own for the 1st time cus once it starts to kick in youll want to be with people whether it be for talking or jumping about the place youll want someone there,since you dont want to hit a club wait untill you can sort a house party or something with your friends believe me itll be well worth it.

				Thanks again for the advice. Maybe I&#039;ll see who&#039;s having a Halloween party this year or something and take it then.<br /><br />Whenever I do decide to, whether it be alone or with people, I&#039;ll post back how it goes. If anyone else has any advice or suggestions I&#039;m still open to it!

				a halloween party would be perfect exspecially if its a fancy dress you would appreciate it when rolling...my only advice is to have food a few hours before and top up on the old vitamins before and after.and i say do it with people only because when your on your own an it kicks in youll be ringing everyone to do something since its that livly.keep us posted love to hear 1st timer experiances...happy tripping.

				Take 100mgs and keep the rest for a redose later. 20 mins after taking the redose it&#039;ll hit you like a bastard and you&#039;ll fuckin&#039; love it.

				I would say doing the first time alone is probably the worst waste of a magical experience I can imagine. E has become what it is today for its empathogenic qualities. The body high etc. is really just icing on the cake. If you do it alone the first time, you risk needing company so much that you will start obsessing over how to get people together, wasting have of your roll with compulsive phoning or something.<br /><br />So, no, I would under no circumstance recommend doing E alone for the first time, you would cheat yourself out of one of the most profound empathic experiences there is. They call it the love drug, kinda sucks if noone is around to be &quot;lovey&quot; with.<br /><br />As you progress in your use, it can be really nice alone, if only to compulsively jerk your limp gerkin to gonzo porn for 3 hours straight, but in the beginning you&#039;d really miss out.

				My fellow snake, I suggest you take ~100mg and then just wing it from there. Let the four winds blow you safely home...<br /><br />Oh, and I would redose when coming down from the peak. Have fun :)

				Follow my advice, it works! And yes, getting people together will be truly worth it. A Halloween party might be great, but do take into account that when you roll you will feel so awesome other people will want to know what you&#039;re on. Be careful who you talk to! But talk to everyone if you can. EDM man, it&#039;s great. You should try downloading or creating a playlist of EDM before you roll. You may or may not like it, but IF you do it will blow your mind!<br /><br />Here are some nice suggestions:<br />Sebastian Ingrosso - Calling<br />Afrojack - Can&#039;t Stop Me Now<br />Antillas &amp; Blinders - Top of the world (this song is exactly how you feel when you roll)<br />Eva Simons - I Don&#039;t Like You<br />Avicii - Levels<br /><br />Try those. I hope you like them!

				personally i would take it once im in the place,i cant give you much advice on when to take the other half since i always bang the whole pill but i would think once your feeling the come up hit it again,if the pills are clean you should pass out not a problem...for a few hours at least.i have friends who sleep straight after taking them,if your tired youll sleep.
