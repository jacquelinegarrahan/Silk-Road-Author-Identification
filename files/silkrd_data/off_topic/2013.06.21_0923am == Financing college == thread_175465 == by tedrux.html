				I want to attend University Of Advancing Technologies for their BA in Game Design . I need some one to help me get there though. firstly I need some one to hold my hand through figuring out how to pay for it and kicking me in the ass to make sure I do things on time /in timely fashion. I need a co-signer.&nbsp; I wonder, can we start a SR Scholarship? lol. like &quot;we&#039;ll pay for your education with drug money but you gotta put it towards educating youth and if you reneg on payments we&#039;ll cut off a finger for every month your payments late&quot;. I&#039;d do it. I don&#039;t have ANY ONE to co-sign a loan . its one of the only things I think might matter. but then again Im not teribly sure i wouldn&#039;t flunk out or that i could find a job even if i could make it through school. I imagine some prerequisite testing might be in order.&nbsp; just fantasizing I guess.

				Programming is one of those areas where you can get a job almost as easily without a degree, provided you have the skills.&nbsp; There&#039;s so much information and tutorials and books out there.&nbsp; If you put a few hours a day aside, within a week you&#039;d be able to make a basic text based game.&nbsp; The only real benefit of getting a degree is the fact you pay for it makes you work harder, and having people round doing the same thing makes for competition.

				&quot;University Of Advancing Technologies&quot; sounds like some bullshit school with non-transferable credits that hand out useless degrees. Maybe you should speak to a counselor at your local community college or university.

I agree that you can learn programing just as well from books as you can from uni but it is in no way as easy to get a job! Unless doing freelance work its very hard to get a job in programming without the qualification!

				I think you should see if this is really what you want to do first before considering Uni. A big part of any game developers work revolves around object orientated programming (c/c++) these languages can be learnt for free,<br />**Clearnet<br />(www.cprogramming.com/)<br />&nbsp;and my advice would be have a go before jumping head first into a Uni course you clearly cannot afford. Also for some good instructional videos search &quot;TheNewBoston&quot; on YouTube he has some fantastic script tutorials which are tailored to newbies.

				well honestly I&#039;m all hyped about creative lead for tech that doesn&#039;t exist yet. I wanna do &#039;Alternate Reality Funducational Games&#039; where they are going through these lessons that just aren&#039;t possible with the standard feed of your five senses. (and yes, smart asses. I know there are more then 5)
