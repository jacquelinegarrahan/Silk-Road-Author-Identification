				The Newbie Forums is a holding pen for people under 50 posts. Everyone that has reached the mark can&#039;t go back and post in there. <br /><br />My conjecture: Besides quarantining spam, it&#039;s utterly useless and holds back people who might want to actually contribute.

				But, I was in the middle of several conversations that I wished to continue!<br /><br />I didn&#039;t like being restricted to the newbie forums, but that, at least, was understandable and reasonable.<br /><br />But once I started several conversations that I wanted to continue, now I&#039;m (in effect) banned from the newbie forums?<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t see the sense in that.<br /><br />I did nothing wrong!

				It is kind of hard for veterans to help the newbies when they cant post in that section. Hopefully admins will fix this issue.

				It seems a little weird to me also. I&#039;d like to contribute everywhere I can. But I cant anymore.&nbsp; :(

				It does seem a bit counterproductive to actively ban veteran members from assisting newbies.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t that the stated purpose of the Newbie Forums?

				Not sure why some can or could &amp; some can&#039;t, but have heard several places that only newbies can post in that forum, or at least those under 50 posts.&nbsp; But we&#039;ve posted &amp; started threads with no issue, so maybe leeway for vendors?<br /><br />NCK
