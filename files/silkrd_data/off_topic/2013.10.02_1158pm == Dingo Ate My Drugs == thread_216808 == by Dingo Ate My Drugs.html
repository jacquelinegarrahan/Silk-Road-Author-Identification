But I am against exploding envelopes, etc.<br />Anyway my email is: dingoatemydrugs@Safe-mail.net<br /><br />Look out for me. I&#039;m not sure if I want to start from square 1 again. I liked Atlantis...<br />After finally getting back up on my feet I have been knocked right down, but this time I don&#039;t know if I want to recover.<br />Fuck this, fuck the Government. Silk Road would have been doing FAR, FAR LESS than 0.1% of global drugs sales anyway.<br />Why don&#039;t they go out and look after real crime.&nbsp; My house got broken into a few years back. The local police didn&#039;t even have time to stay more than 5 minutes.<br />They could not have cared less. They just concentrate on little petty things such as minor speeding offences, drugs, jaywalking, littering, etc.<br />I know that&#039;s irrelevant because the US was the one who shut it down, but I&#039;m sure the 2 countries are much the same.

I was doing fine until a while ago when I got some very large expenses which were not foreseen.<br />So all my free cash went to that and I had to start small. Back to buying QP&#039;s of weed, etc.<br />Finally got the ball rolling again and had thousands in escrow and a few thousand in Silk Road ready to use for O/S purchases.<br />And now I get hit again. Just makes me feel crap and I don&#039;t know if I have the motivation to start again.<br /><br />All I want is another source of income to help pay for my life expenses. The Government takes away a massive amount of my income and also taxes ridiculously on food, clothes, cars, everything!<br />How am I supposed to get ahead in life with this? And I refuse to be one of the majority of people who work 9-5 and spend hours every day commuting to the job which they hate, just to pay the bills. Fuck that! <br />The Government is all corrupt anyway. So many secret deals and hiding everything from the citizens. Very unfair.<br />All I was doing was providing products which are less harmful and addictive than tobacco &amp; alcohol. (Weed, hash, MDMA). Even other drugs should be legal. We deserve the right to choose what we put in our own bodies.<br /><br />Maybe in a while...<br />All the best to you!
