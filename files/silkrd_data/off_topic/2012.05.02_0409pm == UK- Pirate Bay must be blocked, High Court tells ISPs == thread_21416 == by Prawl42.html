				No matter what they do, they can&#039;t fully block it yet. There is few ways of going around the stupid blocks, you can still easily use piratebay. Just a matter of two websites which change ip&#039;s etc, I&#039;m not into torrenting much, but I used piratebay lately while it is still blocked.

				The Pirate Bay is down for me. Is it down for you? It may be, since the site has confirmed it is experiencing “a quite big” Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. It’s unclear who is behind it.

				All of the TPB proxies still work to connect to the site, like http://unblockedpiratebay.com<br /><br />If anonymous is behind this, all I can say is those involved are ass clowns.

				I use a fair few different sources for torrents/downloads, I like Filestube which searches Rapidshare/Mediafire type sites for new UK EP&#039;s DnB, Dubstep, Grime etc and isohunt, piratebay, and used to use BtJunkie for the more mainstream downloads LP&#039;s or films......I find it absolutely pointless to single out thepiratebay.org/se/whateverthefucktheychangeitto.com anyway, It&#039;s just another attack as they have failed to fuck them over before, Limewire, KaZaar, Napster, Megaupload....The endless cycle of taking one down, then other one&#039;s popping up or a different way to get around it etc...Never ending cat n mouse, much as in the drug game!! ;) saying that though. I guess it serves to forge new paths of exploration and thus, improving the way we get our free shheeeeeeeiiitttt!!

When I put my tin foil hat on, I think it could be a lot of different people, could even be a government agency itself, or very easily could be a Russian group who runs one of the other torrent sites.<br /><br />Will be interesting to see how this plays out, because TPB has been on top of their game through all this bullshit.
