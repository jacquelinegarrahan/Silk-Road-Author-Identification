				Here&#039;s my ideal breakfast following drug use, no matter what my DOC was for the previous night.<br /><br />I&#039;ll make a scrumdiddlyumpious breakfast sandwich by spreading peanut butter and jelly on two pancakes then stuffing the shit out of them with eggs, bacon, sausage, bananas, and top it off by drowning it in maple syrup. I make all of this in a bowl and eat it with a spork so I don&#039;t waste anything. Mmmm, diabetes never tasted so damn good!

				Call it gay, but a run and some water always make me feel better. Followed by some eggs over easy with toast and a LOT of bacon. <br /><br />Unless I&#039;m recovering from, as Lim said, cunts. Then I get a 1.75L bottle of Svedka Vodka (It&#039;s cheap) and some xanax. :D

				Proper scrambled eggs &amp; bacon on English Breakfast muffins, a full cafetiere of coffee &amp; a spliff. <br />Scrambled egg has to be done SLOW. Knob of butter on low heat, 2 eggs, gently beat with wooden spoon, when still soft add a little single cream and turn off heat.

It&#039;s perfect drunk food.. as is proven by the sheer amount of meat/salad/mayo that you&#039;ll see on the city centre streets at 3am on the weekends.

Man I fucking love 24 hour shops&nbsp; 8) Those guys have got some serious resolve.

I&#039;m within an hour of there so I know the scene pretty well. The Maze does some pretty good jungle nights &amp; there&#039;s some legendary sound systems (like Desert Storm). Highness &amp; rubadub are cool too, especially when all the students are away. Stealth is one of my favourite clubs in the country, although Basslaced &amp; Detonate are a circus of roid-pumped 5&#039;6 30-somethings and the sort of lardy girls who wear argos clown pendants + hoop earrings. Basslaced on mushrooms= never again, like being at a sci-fi jeremy kyle after party&nbsp; ;D

				Christ-on-a-bike that sounds like something out of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I&#039;ve watched that on Ket. Might have to avoid Basslaced. <br /><br />But yeah I agree on your general overview of Shottingham, it&#039;s a fairly decent city but it&#039;s just surrounded by the who&#039;s-who of human shite lol.

				Getting back on subject I do love English crumpets with egg mayonnaise or peanut butter and cheese or marmite.<br /><br />I dunno if the Americans on here know what an English crumpet is but basically along with the cup of tea, it&#039;s what built the British Empire.

I just think that anywhere north of sayyyy Nottingham you may as well wipe the map and just put &quot;Thar be Dragons!&quot;. Like what you just said about Pikelets? What kind of daft fuck word for a Crumpet is that. <br /><br />And I enjoy the peanut butter crumpet after like a 2-3 day bender when you know you are hungry and can eat after you have come down. Yano when you get between the 48-72 hour mark and you know you can eat again then. Also, BUTTER AND JAM? That ruins the crumpet, it&#039;s gotta be a savoury affair for me. Like with scones. I can&#039;t deal with a sweet scone, it isn&#039;t natural. They have to be cheesey and with peanut butter or they may as well just FUCK OFF! :P
