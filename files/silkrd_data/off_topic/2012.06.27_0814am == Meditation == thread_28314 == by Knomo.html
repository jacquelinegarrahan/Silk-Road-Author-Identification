				Was wondering if any of you ever meditated. <br />And if you do, do you meditate every day? And why ^-^ <br />Or meditation before taking a psychedelic, you do it to calm your nerves or to actually prepare the mind for &#039;whats coming&#039; ?<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to get into it myself, at the moment I&#039;m working with a simple breathing technique, but I can&#039;t get my mind to stop thinking random thoughts.. It just keeps flowing and flowing..<br />Maybe someone has some tips and tricks to &#039;stop thinking&#039; ::)<br /><br />Peace&nbsp; :)

				Hi Knomo,<br /><br />I meditate a lot of the time, but not every day. I try to do it most days, but wouldn&#039;t beat myself up if I missed it for a few days.<br /><br />When you&#039;re starting out, you should get a guided meditation on youtube and just do what the person tells you to do. That is how I started and it worked well for me. <br />After a while doing that, I did a course on meditation, specifically mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is all about being in the present moment. This is where I learned that it is OK if the mind drifts off for a while during meditation.<br /><br />As for meditating on psychedelics; I did it for the first time on acid the other night at a festival. It would never have occurred to me to do it until I read about people doing it on here. All I can say is that it was unbelievable. I was sitting a bit away from a music stage, but could still hear the music. The beats of the music sounded so organic and every beat, I was going further into my mind; it was simply amazing. I&#039;d highly recommend it.<br /><br />Best of luck with the meditation,<br /><br />Psy

				I meditate every day, often more than once. It&#039;s how I keep my head on straight when shit hits the fan. My daily routine is to wake up somewhere around noon before heading outside to tan by my pool. I take the time off to just lay there and ponder life and whatnot. Other times I like to meditate is before blasting off with DMT, while I&#039;m on LSD/shrooms, or when I&#039;m just plain ol&#039; pissed off. ;)

				I&#039;m completely serious. :D I live in the desert mate, everyone tans here whether we want to or not. I heard sunshine helps with depression, so it&#039;s my first priority when I wake up. Not to mention it get&#039;s me all nice and sweaty so I can roll around with my babe. ;) I&#039;d love to have you over for a swim, but it&#039;ll be awhile before I host any more parties here. Two of my refrigerators are broken so I have no room for food, my ice machine broke so no ice for refreshments, and this has nothing to do with partying but my drier broke down as well. FML :-\<br /><br />It&#039;s shit like that which makes me meditate. I fucking hate being broke and unemployed, anyone want to hire an apprentice?! :)

				Yeah it&#039;s true, &#039;vitamin D&#039; is made from sunshine 8) Keeps you from getting depression and other nasty stuff.. But damn, the desert... Must be hot :P<br /><br />So you meditate to &#039;forget&#039; your daily &#039;troubles&#039;? Must like sleeping a lot too then :P<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna start with 2 times a day 10-15minutes, once when I wake up and the other around 4-5pm.. Hope I can find that inner peace ^-^

				I have been known to do this:<br />When a thought enters your mind, don&#039;t fight it. Instead acknowledge that your brain is thinking and let it pass. Focus your attention on the air traveling in and out of your body especially between the two front sinuses just above the eyes. If you can feel the air that is outside your body move as you inhale and exhale you are pretty focused. Do that till you no longer have to force yourself to do it. Do it till you are as aware of your entire body as you are of your lungs and airways. Once you are aware of yourself, let your consciousness drift. Let go of the focus and you will become similarly aware of with whatever is around you. Be mindful of everything but don&#039;t try and focus on it or filter it. Just like thoughts acknowledge what you are aware and let it pass naturally. If you find you can&#039;t help focusing intently on some detail or thought just resume focus on your being.<br />also,<br />Have you ever reached the point where you have stopped thinking but your brain still spits out meaningless strings of disconnected sounds and fragments like a sort of mental white noise? It honestly makes me feel something has corrupted my natural way of being somehow and is preventing a state of just being.

				I love meditating, myself. I usually use visualizations to achieve my goals, such as imagining cleansing water taking away all the little bits of energy (or emotions) clinging from over the course of the day.<br /><br />It&#039;s also fun to share meditations such as that with a significant other, as it generates a simultaneous sense of relaxation and closeness.

				I find it hard to meditate due to circumstances but about a year ago, for several months, I got heavily into it and it was amazing, I was much more relaxed and focused in my daily life, my dreams became extremely bizarre and vivid, almost psychedelic. Once you get past training your mind not to think it gets really interesting.<br /><br />I was achieving some pretty cool states in my long meditations, kind of like fully conscious dreams, one time I came to this place and I wasn&#039;t human but I was like a cell floating by this immensely huge organism and its size was awesome, it was like the scale of a gas giant if I where a man in a space suit. I was below this gargantuan organic shape that was to complex to describe, it was warm and glowing and I felt its comforting warmth (kind of like the warmth of a good roll or an opiate). I just floated below it at some distance basking in its warmth as it was performing complex functions that where not visible to me but I know they where occurring. I&#039;m not religious at all but being in its presence felt divine. The experience really stuck with me, I will remember it forever.<br /><br />...But maybe I just have some latent psychological problems, lol. Anyone else experienced anything weird like this when meditating? Not sure what happened, I do have waking dreams from time to time so I&#039;m guessing my brain was dreaming whilst I was awake.
