				Well, we already know how to travel forward in time -- get in a ship and come close to the speed of light.&nbsp; Outside the ship, time will &quot;flow&quot; more quickly than inside the ship (relatively speaking, both you inside the ship and everyone outside the ship would experience time flowing normally).&nbsp; The closer to the speed of light you get, the more pronounced the effect.&nbsp; So basically, going 99.99% the speed of light means you&#039;re traveling into the future.<br /><br />But I take it you mean traveling backward in time.&nbsp; Well the last I read, nothing we know outright prevents this from being possible... and if you actually were able to go faster than the speed of light, you&#039;d be able to arrive at your destination before you actually left -- so I guess maybe you could do something with that and just repeat a whole bunch...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know; but if time is basically a fourth spatial dimension that we obviously experience very differently than the other 3, it can&#039;t be possible.&nbsp; I mean simply by virtue of traveling back in time, you would yourself travel back in time to the state you were in.&nbsp; As in, just like moving an object to the right of a table: the object moves to the right.&nbsp; You can&#039;t move it to the right and expect it to end up anywhere but right where it goes.<br /><br />... I&#039;m explaining this incredibly poorly.&nbsp; But basically, time travel is always paradoxical.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even need to consider the grandfather paradox, that&#039;s just a weird human concept: the paradox arises the very moment matter &quot;pops into existence&quot; in the past.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t there originally.&nbsp; It&#039;ll displace molecules that will be in different positions.&nbsp; Without alternate dimensions, it&#039;s always a paradox.

				you cannot undo the past. even if you stood in the &#039;past&#039; it would still be the present/ future of now because thats just how the human mind works. if it didn&#039;t work that way you wouldn&#039;t know you;d traveled back in time.<br />however the physics of it seems to be that you cant go back in time, fate is reality, intelligent design is correct , black holes were placed stratigically to maintain some form of balence and to stand as reminders and that black holes are actually gateways , probably to other dimensions and maybe in some way to heaven.&nbsp; this is speculation , not me stating theory as fact (not that you should get so upset at something that you try to say is so obviously nonesense- you dont rage when I say I tangoed with a purple penguine) <br />if I could go back in time Id run away to the town my beloved lives in , save her from the trauma she went through and grow up with her and make sure she never met her fiance. . also I&#039;d write the script to butterfly effect just to be able to have a chuckle at the universes sense of humor.

And then there are the theorized wormholes, where traveling through them would either pull your forward or back in time (To a specific point, not unlimited time travel) depending on the direction you travel in, along with a huge distance covered as the two planes fold over each other where the wormhole would act as a shortcut.<br /><br />To tedrux: Black holes are not wormholes.

But to come back to your earlier explanation of time traveling, wouldn&#039;t traveling along the edges of the universe grant an amplified effect of traveling forward in time? And then there are the theorized wormholes, where traveling through them would either pull your forward or back in time (To a specific point, not unlimited time travel) depending on the direction you travel in, along with a huge distance covered as the two planes fold over each other where the wormhole would act as a shortcut.<br /><br />To tedrux: Black holes are not wormholes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, I was referring to something very specific.&nbsp; Had nothing to do with physics.&nbsp; Just some irrational mistakes I made during an important week.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have been so fucked up... drugs aren&#039;t always good.&nbsp; Some people seem to forget that -- I certainly did that week.<br /><br />Yeah, I don&#039;t know much about what you&#039;re referring to... but you&#039;re right, I do remember some theories about wormholes that end at specific points in time.&nbsp; I really can&#039;t comment on that, I just don&#039;t remember anything I&#039;ve read about them.&nbsp; The problem with worm holes is that they depend on absolute symmetry.&nbsp; By approaching one side of a worm hole, you disrupt that symmetry and the worm hole would collapse (so I read).&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s impossible, but it&#039;s certainly a tricky problem.<br /><br />I will say that no, I don&#039;t believe traveling at the edge of the universe would increase the time dilation effect.&nbsp; Although that kind of depends on what you&#039;re talking about, I mean the rest of the universe isn&#039;t in a single inertial reference frame -- everything is moving relative to everything else, soooo... I dunno, maybe it would increase the effect with respect to some reference frames but not others.&nbsp; That would only be because the difference in velocities would be even greater though, I think.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; Frankly my brain kind of starts boggling when I try to think of the entire universe while factoring in relativity like that :P<br /><br />Time dilation also happens with extreme gravity.&nbsp; Same phenomenon.&nbsp; So here&#039;s a question for you people that I&#039;ve never been able to come to a satisfactory conclusion about: what happens if you try to pull someone that&#039;s right outside a black hole (not past the event horizon) back out with a rope?<br /><br />What would happen?&nbsp; As you approach the black hole, time dilation becomes more and more extreme.&nbsp; The different parts of the rope are going to be experiencing time dilation at different rates.&nbsp; So the part nearest the black hole is going to be moving unbelievably slowly compared to the part way, way out where you&#039;ve got somebody pulling on it (pretend it&#039;s Hercules pulling some unbreakable rope or something, whatever).&nbsp; But the part of the rope way, way out where you&#039;re pulling it is going to be moving very quickly in time as you pull it relative to the part the guy close to the black hole is holding on to.<br /><br />... so wtf happens as you pull the thing?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been able to figure it out.&nbsp; I suspect my problem is that I&#039;m trying to fit time dilation into some modified intuitive sense of absolute time, and that there really isn&#039;t any paradox at all because there is no absolute time... but I&#039;ve never really been sure.

I&#039;m explaining this incredibly poorly.&nbsp; But basically, time travel is always paradoxical.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even need to consider the grandfather paradox, that&#039;s just a weird human concept: the paradox arises the very moment matter &quot;pops into existence&quot; in the past.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t there originally.&nbsp; It&#039;ll displace molecules that will be in different positions.&nbsp; Without alternate dimensions, it&#039;s always a paradox.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>:o that was actually pretty well explained.. at least for simpletons like myself :P<br />thanks for sharing that..

I mean you can&#039;t magically create more rope to fill in the space as you pull it apart, so... well I really just don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always had a great deal of difficulty really deciding what would happen.
