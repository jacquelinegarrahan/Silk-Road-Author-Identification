				So my boyfriend was using fb on my ipad, the other night, and he forgot to log out of it before he went to sleep...<br /><br />Since i use it to read shit on the way to work, i picked it up and put it on my bag, and when i opened it on the train, the last thing he sent his friend was open on the home screen after i unlocked it...<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t see this relationship lasting...&quot;<br /><br />a line of a message he sent his best friend.<br /><br />Im sort of sad, but hey, i shouldnt have read it.<br /><br />Have you guys ever found out something you didnt want to by reading/looking through your other halfs personal things?

				Did it once, wont ever do it again.<br /><br />I would probably confront him about it, and say that it popped up when you went to use the ipad.<br />And ask him what the deal is, or whats going on. Better to talk about it and sort it out/fix it.<br />Because if you pretend that you didnt see it, you will still be acting different and he will see this for sure, probably ask whats wrong, you&#039;ll say nothing, then he&#039;ll get more pissed off with the relationship.<br /><br /><br />/end Dr Phil mode.
