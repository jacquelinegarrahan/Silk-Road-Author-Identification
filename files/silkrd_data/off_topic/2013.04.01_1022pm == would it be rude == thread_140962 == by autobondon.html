				would it be rude for me to cancel an order?<br /><br />so i placed an order for some stamps from DD last thursday night/friday morning and its till processing<br /><br />i see that some people have said his shipping has been a little delayed but on his page it says weekend orders go out monday and i put mine in before the weekend<br /><br />he is compleatly backed up on messages apparently so he hasnt even read mine<br /><br />i dont want to ruin it with him because i hear good things but i want my product to be shipped and theres plenty of others with good stuff and great shipping<br /><br />not sure what to do, also wondering if i do cancel do i get a full refund of my btc?

				no it&#039;s not rude at all. it has been a long weekend though so he&#039;ll probably be even longer than otherwise in catching up. i don&#039;t know the vendor but cancelling would make no difference to him, i don&#039;t think he&#039;d even be aware of your order. as to the amount of btc you get back it depends whether the order is hedged or not and the sr commission is non refundable afaik.

				My orders are backed up too.&nbsp; Long weekend and everyone is out of town with family -even vendors it seems. <br /><br />It&#039;s nice that they don&#039;t mark it in transit and then Leave it there though.&nbsp; It&#039;s better they leave it processing so you can cancel if yu need to.&nbsp; That&#039;s why it&#039;s been left in processing , it&#039;s for you to be able to cancel if you need to.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure he&#039;s seen it but is busy with family stuff. Usually means company is over visiting and they have to hide everything for a few days. Hehe. <br /><br />Not rude at all.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s rude. I mean, the &#039;cancel&#039; link goes live on the buyer&#039;s end after a few days for good reason. I doubt the vendor will be too upset over it, and if they are, maybe not someone you would want to work with anyway? idk...<br /><br />RonSwanson, you give good info... damn gurl.

				8) yesmate i&#039;ve been around longer than my forum account would suggest lol <br />i&#039;m drawing a complete blank on how you know if a processing order is hedged... i know it says in your cart so if it doesn&#039;t say on your orders page then add the item to your cart again and check there?? commission depends on the value of the order, feel like doing some maths? <br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000

				yeah that sounds right. i think you lose another 6% or something if it&#039;s hedged but don&#039;t quote me on that. stick with it if you&#039;re not in a mad rush. if he&#039;s back sorting his orders i&#039;m sure he&#039;ll get to yours soon...

				I try to find something local. My dude tells me &quot;Hey it will be a few days man&quot;. I then get in contact with another dude if I &quot;need&quot; it. Rude, no. Business, yes. I understand everyone is busy and we should all show respect and patience. But, the vendors need to also see that this is a competitive field and in my eyes the &quot;principles&quot; that we (as outlaws in this field) hold true even in the cyber world. I am not saying a dealer should be available 24/7. But, being prompt and also maybe updating a user page informing all customers that you aren&#039;t going to be around for some time is all I could ask for in that situation. 8)
