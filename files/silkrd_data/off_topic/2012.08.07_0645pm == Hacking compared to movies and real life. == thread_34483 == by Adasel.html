				I have recently become very interested in hacking, and then i watched the movie &quot;hackers&quot; and i was a bit like hmmm.<br />I mean lets have a basic scenario.&nbsp; Lets say you wanted to take down a company, maybe even hold them to ransom for whatever reason.<br />Would it even be remotely possible to a)shut down a company&#039;s cctv service from a remote location before entering the premises<br />and b) have someone on the outside do some kind of attack so that said company&#039;s internet gets shut down.&nbsp; Then all it takes is a phone call to bring their servers back online.<br /><br />Those are the only real-life scenarios i can think of.&nbsp; Then i wondered if even these are possible.

				First of all the movie &quot;Hackers&quot; is in no way a good representation of real life hacking. I think the only film I&#039;ve seen that was close was The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (the Swedish one at least, haven&#039;t seen the American one.) I remember one scene at least where she&#039;s using SQL queries to get information. Can&#039;t remember if they showed how she got access to the database to begin with, though (I was pretty drunk when I watched it) so movies isn&#039;t a good place to look for real hacking. I&#039;d recommend you start reading posts in reddit.com/r/netsec (warning: clearnet) to get a better idea about real hacking. There&#039;s also plenty of literature out there. If you&#039;d like to practice common techniques used to exploit websites I&#039;d recommend hackthissite.org (again, clearnet.) If you really want to delve into the &quot;hacker&quot; community there are conventions throughout the year (at least in the U.S.) like DEFCON where you can learn a TON. Hope this helps point you in the right direction.
