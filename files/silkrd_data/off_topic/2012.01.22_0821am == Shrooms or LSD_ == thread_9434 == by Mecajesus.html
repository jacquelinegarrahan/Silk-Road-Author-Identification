				I&#039;m just wondering what would give you a trip. Regardless of potency.<br /><br />Like which would you most likely see hallucinations from, with a better trip.<br /><br />I&#039;m saying as in you took equal dosage of one another.<br /><br />Also is DMT any good?<br /><br />What is your opinions?

				Id say LSD is a better and has better visuals, but thats my opinion.<br />Shrooms are good but the bodyload can be bad someime.<br /><br />If you took an equal dosage you&#039;d only feel the LSD since its weighed in micrograms(ug)<br />not grams like&nbsp; shrooms<br /><br />Yes DMT is good but intense so i wouldn&#039;t recommend it for a first time psychedelic user.

				You&#039;re really oversimplifying psychadelics. It&#039;s not like there&#039;s some simple comparison as in 1 hit of acid = 1.5g of shrooms. It&#039;s just not like that. Apples to oranges.<br />Since you&#039;re obviously a new user, I&#039;d recommend acid for your first time. It&#039;s longer in duration, but tends to be more forgiving and not as likely to give a bad trip. But you may want to do more research before you jump into this, psychedelics give some cool visuals, but that&#039;s only like 20% of the experience.<br />I haven&#039;t had the chance to try DMT myself, though I&#039;d like to soon. But supposedly it&#039;s hard to have a &quot;bad trip&quot; because it&#039;s so short and it&#039;s so intense that it&#039;s completely overwhelming. I&#039;ve heard a few people say that DMT was their first psychedelic and it worked out just fine. That may be what you should be looking for, since you seem to just want to hallucinate a lot.

				Aliahad is right, the situation here is being oversimplified.<br /><br />Both mushrooms and acid will give you a psychedelic trip, but the trip will be much more than simple hallucinations. Do some research on both and read up on some trip reports as well.<br /><br />As I was told back in the day... mushrooms will teach you your roots, lucy will help spread your wings and show you the connectedness of the universe.<br />However this is also an oversimplification.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be afraid of DMT for a first time psychedelic if you aren&#039;t afraid of being amazed and quite possibly having your view of reality shattered. I have a friend who used it his first time and certainly loved it. Though I also know those who enjoyed a first time on a half 8th of mushrooms and those who enjoyed a full 8th. Those who enjoyed a hit of acid and those who enjoyed four hits of acid. It all comes down to you and what you are ready for. Read up on them as you will certainly think differently on these substances as well as hallucinating, but if you can remember that you will NOT be stuck tripping forever and that when you think you are having a bad trip you are able to remember that you are JUST TRIPPING, then you will probably be ok. Have friends you trust nearby and be in a safe environment. Set and setting are KEY.

				Mushrooms and LSD are VERY different experiences.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found that LSD gives me a lot of energy and makes me really really happy.&nbsp; However, LSD also makes me extremely ADD, and my thought processes are fairly messed up.&nbsp; It&#039;s really difficult to act normal or &quot;maintain.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;ve often said that, on acid, everything seems like a good idea no matter how bad of an idea it may be.&nbsp; For example, I once took a hit of acid one night intending to watch a trippy movie, but after about 10 minutes, I got bored with the movie and got in my car and started driving.&nbsp; Somehow, I ended up at the grocery store at about 1 AM, where I bought a box of popsicles, then I got on the highway just because I felt like driving really, really fast.&nbsp; It started storming while I was driving, and I ended up about 30 miles from home, sitting in the parking lot of a closed gas station in the middle of a severe thunderstorm eating popsicles in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Also, the amount of fun one has on LSD is typically in proportion to the number of people around you who are also tripping.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like mushrooms as much, personally, as I&#039;ve found the muscle-relaxant effects to be fairly unpleasant.&nbsp; As opposed to the energy LSD gives you, mushrooms mellow you out a lot more, to the point where it becomes a bit of a hassle to move at all.&nbsp; However, I&#039;ve found that the visuals on mushrooms are more obvious and vivid.&nbsp; On LSD, visuals are usually quick and catch you by surprise, such as trails on moving objects.&nbsp; On mushrooms, you can actually watch the patterns on your carpet move and spin around.&nbsp; Also, mushrooms never really &quot;fucked me up&quot; as much as LSD did; in other words, it&#039;s easier to &quot;maintain&quot; and your thought patterns are less erratic and chaotic.&nbsp; Mushrooms are probably better if you&#039;re used to weed and just want to veg out on the couch (alone - personally, when I&#039;m on shrooms, I just plain don&#039;t want anyone around) and watch shit.

				As others have eloquently said in this thread you are obviously new to psychedelics, other wise this question would be out of the matter.<br /><br />The first time I ever tried a hallucinogen (ruling out salvia) was 3.5g of shrooms. It was an awesome trip. Very intense visuals and mind-boggling thoughts. It just shoved me into another mind-state that was very hard to comprehend. I had to keep telling myself that I was tripping on shrooms. Compared to acid (which I tried later on) it was a lot more disorienting and confusing. I had a lot more visuals on shrooms though than acid. But visuals are not the trip man. I repeat, visuals are not the main part of the trip. It&#039;s the way it skews your perspective on your immediate reality, the way you process the information you are receiving from your environment. This is what can scare most people. It totally changes the way you think. And it you won&#039;t be &quot;normal&quot; again until you go to sleep and wake up the next day.<br /><br />I took 4 hits of acid once. It was very intense also, but less disorienting than the shrooms. The trip is more &quot;clear&quot;. On acid I see a lot more patterns. I remember I was staring at a white table cloth, and I was able to see so many patterns in something that had none. I was falling into the pattern. It was so awesome...too awesome. I became nauseous and immediatly threw up the sugar cubes (it was the cleanest puke ever haha) and I felt amazing. Walking on acid is so fun, or riding a long board/bike. You can&#039;t gauge how fast you are going and it is just so exhilarating. Acid wasn&#039;t as euphoric as shrooms though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both of these trips were spontaneous. No planning at all. But I have some of the best friends in the world to trip with and it&#039;s always a good time. You just gotta be sure you have no obligations and you have a clear conscience. You have to know your self very well or your in for a loooong ride. You can&#039;t go wrong with either substance. I&#039;ve never done DMT, but I would advise against it for your first experience.
