				It seems like she is trying to help and make the world a better place. But, her recent idea (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=33602.0)&nbsp; to weed out the kids by her acting as a paid intermediary and providing test kits and drug danger information seemed a little excessive. Possibly a bit pretentious.

				No, I could never hate her ( &lt;3 pine ). As far as I know, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and ideas. She pitches ideas &amp; opinions, some are good, some less good. It would be worse if she wouldn&#039;t bother at all. Like the PGP club is a really good way to teach everyone to use PGP. What I can&#039;t understand is why would the OP have a problem with this?(My bet is on jealousy :) ) And who the fuck cares if she is really a she, this forum is anonymous, I can be a blue saber tooth cat...&nbsp; I would love to see what the OP has pitched/done for this forum...<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Personally I think Pine is a great contributor to the SilkRoad community. <br /><br />Especially with his/her? Threads related to using PGP as most new users don&#039;t bother with or know how to use PGP which puts them at greater risk.<br /><br />Plus you got to love that avatar 8)<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				Is this thread fucking for real?&nbsp; I thought I was trippin for a sec.<br /><br />Pine is pretty smart, certainly interesting and is passionate about this place which apparently are traits that piss off some cranialplegics.&nbsp; I never read her/his posts about getting kids out and maybe it was pretentious but who really gives a feck?&nbsp; Throw some ideas out and see what sticks.<br /><br />Besides, Pine could be as annoying as the bastard child of Glen Beck and a Shih tzu but would pale in comparison to the douche that decides to start a thread about it.

				Things I like about pine:<br />1.&nbsp; Seems to genuinely want to help the community.<br />2.&nbsp; Seems pretty nice for the most part.<br />Things I don&#039;t like about pine:<br />1.&nbsp; The picture is known to be a fake from clickflashwhirr online, it isn&#039;t her.&nbsp; It creeps me the fuck out that he/she pretends to be the woman in the photo, just having the photo is one thing but pine has been actively pretending to be the woman in that photo including having a thread about naked pics etc. is just fucking weird and I would appreciate an explanation.&nbsp; In any event I highly doubt anyone intelligent would wear a vanity scarf.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; I agree that pine has a holier than thou attitude, this wouldn&#039;t bother me because pine actually seems to be somewhat knowledgeable in some fields, but it&#039;s just such a contradiction when they&#039;re also pretending to be a woman and posting about naked pics etc.&nbsp; Beyond that pines idea to filter out immature users was one of the stupidest ideas I&#039;ve ever heard, as far as I can tell there isn&#039;t a single person on these forums who agreed with it, and she even argued that it was a good idea because of the human psychology of letters vs internet pages, I mean what the fuck?&nbsp; Honestly I don&#039;t find the pgp club to be at all useful either, there are already so many completely satisfactory tutorials on here and on the clear net where you download pgp that it just seems irrelevant.<br /><br />So I guess I fit the no. 7, pine just rubs me the wrong way, but that&#039;s ok because pine helps some noobs etc and seems to be a fairly valuable member of sr community.

				I guess we&#039;re all just butthurt because when that clickflashwhirr thing came up all of our dreams were dashed to pieces, honestly I think that everyone would like pine if he/she would just quit pretending to be the chick in the photo and remove that photo, all it serves as now is a reminder that there are no chicks on the internet and that we can still fall for it, I guess I just don&#039;t see the point of a serious poster pretending to be a hot woman.&nbsp; Anyway, how pine always talks about how he/she doesn&#039;t do drugs as if trying to impress himself to LE that he assumes is reading his posts as an unbiased source also annoys me, that is a big part of the holier than thou attitude I perceive emanating all around those pixels.

				Yes I find HIM arrogant and manipulative in getting groups of people to love him.&nbsp; <br /><br />He uses a picture of a girl as his avatar and all the retards around here swarm around him because of it.<br /><br />He has given SOME helpful advice, but almost everything i&#039;ve read from him are clear and simple answers that have already been discussed in great depth, in other words he&#039;s done little more to contribute to this community then anyone else, yet people flock to him as a god because he has a picture of a girl as his avatar.<br /><br />He is also brash, and almost rude for unnecessary reasons, not to mention his answers (it may just be a language barrier issue) are disjointed, reciprocal, repetitive, and contradictory to his own statements in the very same post.

They are just ideas. I got a lot of flak about my views on drug legalization for example (aside: Not that it affects the validity of my arguments one way or the other but I&#039;m not sure the people who support legalization realize that most SR vendors and staff completely agree with my general point of view on this matter, DPR himself made a entire thread about the subject describing the rationale). Frankly there are some people whose entire raison d&#039;être is summed up by this picture:<br /><br />https://xkcd.com/386/<br /><br />If you think I&#039;m wrong, that&#039;s perfectly valid, but don&#039;t let it bother you into starting antagonistic threads, that is child-like behavior.<br /><br />Lastly, on the subject of arrogance. Look closely at this picture:<br /><br />https://secure.flickr.com/photos/clickflashwhirr/5483790718/lightbox/<br /><br />Do you see arrogance? I think the picture shows somebody who is confident that they are exceptionally attractive and is not afraid of that fact. I see a very Roman looking face and a very Roman attitude, that instant in time shows a great sense of dignitas about her a Roman would say. That to me is admirable. I also have ideas that are absolute in my mind and I am not afraid to declare what I believe to be correct and some others to be wrong. People who constantly nitpick, interpreting every single idea with a relativistic perspective I have zero time for and I think they have weak minds, there is a Giant Difference between a lack of available evidence and merely being indecisive. There are some things that are true, will always be true and that is that.<br /><br />It is of course, always possible that I am dead wrong. The door is always left open since while some things are absolutes, it does not imply pine actually knows what they all are. I always welcome a sharing of opinions. I am not a theist but I have read the Bible in its entirety. I am not a Communist, but I have read Das Kapital. Differing opinions do not phase me, or I would not bother to start threads soliciting them, I have no time for sycophantic behavior.<br /><br />Having strong opinions while welcoming new ones with the possibility of changing ones mind is ancient Western tradition. You will notice this place is called a *Forum* and that its inhabitants belong to an *Agora*. It is clear to me that the OP does not have the courage to present his or her true anonymous identity, instead choosing to hide behind alts to express personal grievances and is therefore a coward by definition. You do not belong here unless you respect the traditions of the West. Since you lack the veritas to show your true face, you do not.

				I assume most girls on the web are guys, lol ;P<br /><br />I don&#039;t find Pine annoying at all. In fact, I commend her/him for making it easier for the non tech-savvy users on SR to not become intimidated by PGP and the likes. Yes, there are a ton of guides out there that will show one how to use PGP, but some people need someone to hold their hand while he or she is going through the process. If Pine is willing take time out of his/her day to help another person become comfortable with PGP then we have no right to criticize Pine. We should help each other try to use SR as securely as possible, so we can make LE&#039;s job as hard as possible.

They are just ideas. I got a lot of flak about my views on drug legalization for example (aside: Not that it affects the validity of my arguments one way or the other but I&#039;m not sure the people who support legalization realize that most SR vendors and staff completely agree with my general point of view on this matter, DPR himself made a entire thread about the subject describing the rationale). Frankly there are some people whose entire raison d&#039;être is summed up by this picture:<br /><br />https://xkcd.com/386/<br /><br />If you think I&#039;m wrong, that&#039;s perfectly valid, but don&#039;t let it bother you into starting antagonistic threads, that is child-like behavior.<br /><br />Lastly, on the subject of arrogance. Look closely at this picture:<br /><br />https://secure.flickr.com/photos/clickflashwhirr/5483790718/lightbox/<br /><br />Do you see arrogance? I think the picture shows somebody who is confident that they are exceptionally attractive and is not afraid of that fact. I see a very Roman looking face and a very Roman attitude, that instant in time shows a great sense of dignitas about her a Roman would say. That to me is admirable. I also have ideas that are absolute in my mind and I am not afraid to declare what I believe to be correct and some others to be wrong. People who constantly nitpick, interpreting every single idea with a relativistic perspective I have zero time for and I think they have weak minds, there is a Giant Difference between a lack of available evidence and merely being indecisive. There are some things that are true, will always be true and that is that.<br /><br />It is of course, always possible that I am dead wrong. The door is always left open since while some things are absolutes, it does not imply pine actually knows what they all are. I always welcome a sharing of opinions. I am not a theist but I have read the Bible in its entirety. I am not a Communist, but I have read Das Kapital. Differing opinions do not phase me, or I would not bother to start threads soliciting them, I have no time for sycophantic behavior.<br /><br />Having strong opinions while welcoming new ones with the possibility of changing ones mind is ancient Western tradition. You will notice this place is called a *Forum* and that its inhabitants belong to an *Agora*. It is clear to me that the OP does not have the courage to present his or her true anonymous identity, instead choosing to hide behind alts to express personal grievances and is therefore a coward by definition. You do not belong here unless you respect the traditions of the West. Since you lack the veritas to show your true face, you do not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol, this is why I agree with the holier than thou attitude comment so much, pretending to be a girl on the internet to manipulate people is stupid period, don&#039;t try and justify it with ramblings on philosophy.&nbsp; Why the fuck did you choose that picture as your avatar in the first place if as you say, you want to be judged for your actions, why not just leave it blank?&nbsp; Your post oozes hypocrisy and your ramblings about roman faces etc are so out of place that I don&#039;t even know what to say.

				Hey Pine, all I can say is I find the women in that picture very attractive, confident and sexy. I respect you anonymity. I&#039;ll just go on fantasizing you really look like that pic. And to those who say their are no women on the Internet, that&#039;s just silly. I have recently met some very lovely young engineering students from one of the most respected technology schools in the world. They can go stride for stride with any male at the same point in their life. It is certainly true there&#039;s a shortage of women in technology, but the number is not ZERO! Rock on Pine. Who gives a shit what the haters think, Say what you want to say. It&#039;s a wild new world here. People are free not to read your posts if they don&#039;t care for you or your attitude. But know there are some of us who will read them.

				I&#039;m really surprised to be reading this, pine is one of this forum&#039;s best contributors.<br /><br />Pine has never tried to pretend to be the girl in his avatar, I remember him posting links to clickflashwhatever&#039;s page when asked about it a long time ago.<br /><br />Admittedly pine&#039;s last idea about preventing kids from using SR was not great, but usually his posts are accurate, detailed, and helpful.&nbsp; Look back at pine&#039;s early posts if you want to see him dropping some serious knowledge (lately I feel his initiative has been to help out new members, so his recent posts may seem reiterated or more simple).&nbsp; <br /><br />Much love to you pine!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

It certainly comes across as something with personal motivation rather than a passing opinion.<br /><br /><br /><br />FWIW, I enjoy reading Pine&#039;s educational and informative posts. I may not always agree with everything he/she says, but I&#039;d sure as hell rather read the discussions he/she initiates/provokes rather than some of the drivel posted here. Regardless, even if he/she was annoying I&#039;d see it as irrelevant considering the time and effort he/she devotes to helping newbies in a non-daunting and friendly way. Those sorts of actions are worth a hell of a lot around here IMO.

				I think Pine is great, just like most of our resident clever fuckers.&nbsp; Anyone who feels like Pine is trying to come across as a know-it-all should ask themselves why they feel so threatened by clever people.&nbsp; Maybe the problem is not Pine&#039;s intellect, but your own?<br /><br />As for the he/she factor, who gives a flying fuck.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like you&#039;d ever get to lay a chick from an anonymous drug forum anyway, so why does it matter.&nbsp; It&#039;s like me getting pissed at the guy above me for pretending to be a mushroom.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />EDIT, I meant the guy above the shill.&nbsp; ;)
