				just finished up our Grand Daddy Purple ... trying to find a good vendor with a sativa-dominant strain .... but so many vendors are currently out of most of their stuff.&nbsp; envious of how many options you have going there!

				Last thing I smoked was meth :P <br /><br />I actually don&#039;t know what strain of weed I have right now. I never really got versed in it and have just bought locally what my friends recommended. I&#039;ve only smoked a few different batches (could be all the same strain for all I know--they mostly looked the same) but my friends have assured me after smoking it that it was &quot;good shit&quot;. Perhaps at some point I&#039;ll shop around here on SR and try some different strains so I can actually tell the difference between a few. <br /><br />Cheers!

				Makes sense. I really want to try some strains that give energy or something. The shit I smoke mellows me out and has quite the body high I guess since it&#039;s as if I just sink down into my seat and don&#039;t want to move except for food! I can&#039;t really let myself smoke daily since it hits me for a couple hours and makes it harder to get anything done. Gotta love that smoke though!

				Snoopish -- You should try a sativa!&nbsp; Your experiences in the past with weed that causes &quot;couch lock&quot; have probably been with an indica strain.&nbsp; Those are the ones that keep you stuck to the couch, not wanting to move, not wanting to do much of anything -- they make you sleepy, really relaxed, etc.&nbsp; Sativas, on the other hand, are more &quot;uplifting&quot; and &quot;energetic&quot; -- they can make you feel more creative too.<br /><br />See if you can find a good sativa ... or sativa-dominant hybrid if you can!&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably like it better, if you don&#039;t enjoy the couchlock feeling.&nbsp; (i don&#039;t either!)

				i just grew some killing fields from sannies shop, it grew really nicely, very purple, alright yield, but the quality is just out of this world. Haven&#039;t even cured it yet and it tastes amazing and smokes very smooth. One of the most potent strains I&#039;ve had in a while. I&#039;d love to share it with you guys, but I can&#039;t even grow enough to keep myself stocked.. If I can up my game a bit I&#039;m sure it will be a hit around here.

				Only one eighth left for that deathstar OG! Everyone wants a piece of death apparently lol. IMO eroma OG has bigger nugs because the flower is inherently bigger. Either strain will probably put an insomniac to bed though.

I don&#039;t get paranoid so much anymore, I just lose my short-term memory :X For an example I put the lighter in my pocket and moments later when I need to use it I&#039;ve forgotten that it&#039;s there &lt;.&lt; Then I&#039;ll search 3-5 minutes and finally find it in my pocket X_X... Also I&#039;ve realized that if I start being paranoid about my lock then it means it&#039;s locked, when I don&#039;t then it isn&#039;t. Funny how that works :P<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				wax is prolly the most concentrated form of weed out there right now. one way to make it is to use a pollen extractor +some butane. The end product is very gooey and dank tasting. usually need a skillet to smoke it, its like this thing you heat up with a torch then put under a special bong extension, then you dab some wax onto the skillet to get real high. You can also use wax to top up your bowl with some bud and kief and whatnot, will get you high as a kite lol. Flavor is in so relevant with waxes cuz of the high concentration. i can get some that are above the 80% THC level.

				depends on what the wax is made from. if you make it from chronic don&#039;t expect some mindblowing wax. I guess the best way to tell if its potent is to look at the thc content (if its lab tested ofc).

I have got a small sample of PPP (Pure Power Plant) which I have listed and in my opinion the PPP has more crystals and is on par with the Blueberry in regards to the high.<br /><br />Hope you guys enjoy<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/e4cfec961a
