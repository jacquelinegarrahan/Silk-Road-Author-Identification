				I suppose the drug legalization would truly be complete if people used other narcotics more than they do alcohol, <br /><br />I like to drink alcohol in serious amounts quite often, and since its legal, cheap, readily available and such, i usually think little off it - as most people i suppose.<br /><br />When looking at it rationally i suppose alcohol would actually be one of the most dangerous drugs available. Take 5 times the effective dose and your dead, while structural use i probably quite deadly as well. Taking some barbiturates to help you fall asleep probably is safer than taking a bottle of wine, but most people prefer the latter, and i suppose its a bit more fun mostly too.<br /><br />Proper absinthe may be interesting though. When the wort is limited to legal amounts i suppose its mostly the alcohol at work, especially since absinthes often have 70% or so by volume. I reckon that would knock me out long before the green fairy pays a visit. Although i&#039;m not usually a big fan of hallucinogens, i think it would be interesting to see what it does when the main effect is not from alcohol.

That said, I admitted to myself in complete honestly that alcohol + mj makes a very nice combination. It (the alcohol) is not just a castoff, garbage, government-pushed drug. I mean, it kind of is those things ;) but it&#039;s got some things going for it, too, namely: taste, and effect. It also takes some serious work to poison yourself. If I knew a bunch of teenagers were going to get into a case of beer vs. a bag of GHB, I know which situation I&#039;d be more worried about.<br /><br />So... favourites. Darker beers - stout and porter. Vodka seven lime. Gin tonic lime. A good sangria. Good wines, though someone else has to pick em. I do a little whiskey drinking but would almost always rather have rum.

				What substances have you used to substitute alcohol? <br /><br />I&#039;ve found it very hard to get something that results in similar effects. Sure i can get the sedative effects from something else, but the combination of just some stimulation with sedation kicking in eludes me.

I&#039;d likewise be interested to hear some suggestions.

Also, i like scotch. usually on the rocks, sometimes with water. and eventhough i kinda quit drinking to focus on my drug use, i had a very good scotch the other night in a beautiful, historic bar.&nbsp; and it was yummy. wish i had had a cuban to go with it...<br /><br />Fun Fact: yeungling&nbsp; is the official beer of God&#039;s Waiting Room! <br /><br />CHEERS!

				Trash, if you like Belgium beers, see if you can get anything from Unibroue in from Quebec in your area. They do award-winning double and triple fermented beers without the super sweet stuff that Belgium also turns out (I cannae stand cherry fricking beer. A dry apricot or the like otoh...).

				today(yesterday?) i finally tried ketamine which is supposed to be similar to alc but i thought it was way overrated, found mxe more enjoyable, both make me ridiculously chatty and pretty silly. now i&#039;m taking a shit ton of this &#039;dietary supplement&#039; called phenibut which is pretty chilled and &#039;supports feelings of wellbeing and relaxation&#039;. it&#039;s making me feel pretty nice, i stacked it 2 times before managing to put my shoes on and it has made me walk more special needs than the k earlier. anyway apparently this phenibut stuff works on the same receptors as ghb so it&#039;s like ghb jr i guess. i don&#039;t know much about it really, it&#039;s not mine. kinda makes me want to chain smoke but not enough to be bothered to roll :)
