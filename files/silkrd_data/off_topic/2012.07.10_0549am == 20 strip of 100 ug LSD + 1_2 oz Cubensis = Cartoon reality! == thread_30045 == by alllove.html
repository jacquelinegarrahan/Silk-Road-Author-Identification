				I tend to trip alone a lot and prefer the private introspection rather than hearing others talk nonsense (although not always true). But on this occassion I dropped the 20 and 1/2 oz at the same time and after about 2-3 hours, nothing was sharp anymore, it was all rounded and the colors turned more pastel than usual. I had never experienced anything like this on any other drug but it literally felt like my reality had turned into a cartoon. Of course I was also smoking bud the entire time but getting back to the fact that I usually trip alone, friends unexpectedly arrived and I COULDN&#039;T STOP LAUGHING they all looked like characters out of Linklater&#039;s &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; I probably looked crazy but my friends have come to expect a level of weirdness lmao. Just thought I&#039;d share :P

				Damn, I can&#039;t say I have. That sounds insane. I actually had my first out of body experience about a month ago, on a high ass dose of shrooms. That was absolutely nuts.<br /><br />I honestly had no idea it was actually possible, I thought it was just some Hollywood plot device.

				For such a heroic dose I was expecting something much more insane haha. I took 2 Shiva&#039;s (from Mitanox) and smoked a lot of weed. During the peak everything was infinite mechanical snakes, slithering in and out of every pore of my existence.

				I have done a half ounce of shrooms before and experienced things that I can&#039;t even really express in words too well, but they were like wormholes from the ceiling and experiencing myself&nbsp; as a different person and my consciousness as a whole different type of being. There was me the Earthling and then the awakened me who was infinite and knew everything. It was a priceless experience.

				That is nutty alllove. I once took 6gs of mushrooms and 4 hits of good lsd and it kind of felt like they canceled each other out. but i still was tripping just in a weird way that felt like one would cancel the other out and it would come in waves
