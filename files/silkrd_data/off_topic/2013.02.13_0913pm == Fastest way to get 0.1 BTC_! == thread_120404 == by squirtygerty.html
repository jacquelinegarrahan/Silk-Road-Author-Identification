				I added the required amount of BTC with a little extra and a few hours later it was in my account.<br /><br />Unfortunately when i went to send the money the vendor had readjusted his price and I&#039;m now 0.01 BTC short.<br /><br />What&#039;s the fastest way to get 0.01BTC as I wanted to order something tonight.<br /><br />Cheers, Squirty.
