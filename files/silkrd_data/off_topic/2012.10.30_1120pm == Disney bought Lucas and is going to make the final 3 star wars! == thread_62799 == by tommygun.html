				WOW!<br /><br />Disney to make new &#039;Star Wars&#039; films after buying Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion<br />Oct. 30, 2012, 5:48 PM EST<br />LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A decade after George Lucas said &quot;Star Wars&quot; was finished on the big screen, a new trilogy is destined for theaters, since The Walt Disney Co. announced Tuesday that it was buying Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion.<br /><br />The seventh movie, with a working title of &quot;Episode 7,&quot; is set for release in 2015. Episodes 8 and 9 will follow. The new trilogy will carry the story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia beyond &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; the third film released and the sixth in the saga. After that, Disney plans a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie every two or three years. Lucas will serve as the creative consultant for the new movies.<br /><br />&quot;For the past 35 years, one of my greatest pleasures has been to see &#039;Star Wars&#039; passed from one generation to the next,&quot; said Lucas, chairman and CEO of Lucasfilm Ltd. &quot;It&#039;s now time for me to pass &#039;Star Wars&#039; on to a new generation of filmmakers. I&#039;ve always believed that &#039;Star Wars&#039; could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime.&quot;<br /><br />Bing: &#039;Star Wars&#039; fans on Blu-ray release<br /><br />Disney CEO Bob Iger said Lucusfilm had already developed an extensive story line on the next trilogy and that &quot;Episode 7&quot; was now in early-stage development.<br /><br />The Walt Disney Co. announced the blockbuster agreement to buy Lucasfilm in cash and stock Tuesday. The deal includes Lucasfilm&#039;s prized high-tech production companies, Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound, as well as rights to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise.<br /><br />Lucas was hailed as a cinematic visionary when the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; came out in 1977. But he had become an object of often-vicious ridicule by the time he released 3-D versions of all six films in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise earlier this year.<br /><br />Die-hard &quot;Star War&quot; fans had been vilifying Lucas for years, convinced that he had become a commercial sell-out and had compounded his sins by desecrating the heroic tale that he originally sought to tell. They railed against him for adding grating characters such as Jar Jar Binks in the second trilogy and attacked him for tinkering with the original trilogy, too. Any revision -- from little things like making the Ewoks blink or bigger alterations like making a green-skinned alien named Greedo take the first shot at Han Solo in a famous bar scene -- were treated as blasphemy.<br /><br />The criticism grated on Lucas, who vowed never to make another &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie during an interview with The New York Times earlier this year.<br /><br />&quot;Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?&quot; Lucas told the Times.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope they&#039;re better than episode 1 &amp; 2.<br />+1 Tommygun&nbsp; :)
