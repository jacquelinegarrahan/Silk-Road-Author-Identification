				I really never felt the same way I am feeling right now... Castles in the sky... Colors brighten up ... Every thing is mesmerizing...<br />&nbsp;<br />5 years ago, all the friends decided to do some smack (Told each other we will do it just once) But then there was no coming back.. And 6 years in vein.. Every time I had a friend to overcome any addiction in this world ( Mary Jane) .. And many times telling my self that I want something which would go deep in my brain .. And still I am (Awake) not like those Opiates which makes you relaxed and gives you a sense that you are on top of the world (Yes actually you are) but not for long, Not till these fuckin opiates get deposited in every tissue of your blood cells... and then you cannot live without these .. And then you use them with breaks in between telling yourself&nbsp; you would decrease the dosage and finally will not abuse these opiates again... <br /><br />Today I cleared out many things with my dad. The fights which were going on from a long time and never ending.... And i finally decided not to leave home and would stay with my parents.. And will get a job, and establish myself and will do things in proper manner from now. Now I came to know how things are used in a proper way .. No substance abuse, Do it enjoy it and don&#039;t use again the next day, or next day, or next day.. But use it in a perfect setting.. <br /><br />Grow spiritually and evolve. Shine like the sun and and shed light on the one&#039;s who are ignorant, and spread knowledge. Because in the end Knowledge is power....<br /><br />Stay Safe,<br />psytrip

				I&#039;m glad that it has benefited you. It opened me up in many ways too. Don&#039;t forget though that MDMA is a neurotoxin. My short-term memory has been impaired by taking MDMA too many times. Don&#039;t take it more often than once every few months at most.

Even if you take it once a month, from the next day you should exercise and eat healthy and get enough sleep to recover your lose from the trip.. Anyways stay safe and respect the substance and it will respect you back.... <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120542.msg827585#msg827585">Quote from: camomug on February 15, 2013, 07:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve been looking to try some MDMA for a while.&nbsp; I have a friend getting some speakers from Supertrips so hopefully I&#039;ll get to experience this <br />I hear nothing but good stuff about MDMA, very excited to try it out<br />Any recommendations for a first-timer?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It basically depends upon the purity of the molly, so if your stuff is more than 80% pure, make it anywhere between 100- 120 mg, feel the effects and may be if you need a booster, take another 40 - 60 mg when you are at the peak.. Taking a booster is not advised mainly but most of the people does (including me lol)... :-) And from the next very day don&#039;t even think about touching the substance for about a month.. generally its 2 months.. Anyways, enjoy your Trip :-) and spread the love...<br /><br />Stay safe,<br />psytrip
