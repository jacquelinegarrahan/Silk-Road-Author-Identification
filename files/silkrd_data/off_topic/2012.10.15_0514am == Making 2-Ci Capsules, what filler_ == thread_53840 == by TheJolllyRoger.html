				i agree, i really dont think you should use any filler - just put the 2c-i in the capsule<br /><br />why do you think you need to use something else?

				Good point! its just i read online a filler helps you from getting the serious&nbsp; &quot;whack&quot; when it becomes active so to speak. But most people like that so...<br /><br />i scrapped that idea and stayed up all night making up 50mg caps of 2C-i haha! listing is here<br /><br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/f4b16204d6<br /><br />First three people to order get one 50mg Cap for free!

				i might not be remembering correctly, but you dont think thats too much for a single dose? <br /><br />i think you should cut them in half and then sell them as two, that way people can more easily control their dosage. some would only need half the capsule i believe especially if they are new to psychedelics (more thinking if they get it from someone who gets it from you and are just told to take it but not the correct amount inside). or worse they might think its a single dose and alright to snort, then empty out the capsule and insufflate the whole thing which could definitely be a bad idea <br /><br />just kinda overly cautious and am always for measuring out smaller doses and taking more rather than larger doses and taking too much all at once

				ok i did more research to check what i said and i just want to reiterate i think you should either split the caps in half or third, or even write 50 mg on the capsules to ensure people know how much is in them. even that would dangerous though because many people dont do the research they should to determine dose or do not have an accurate enough scale - i think you could be the more responsible one and ensure others safety in my opinion, because the problem is when people get a chemical in a capsule they will often assume that is the proper amount to take. they wont know they NEED to split the 50 mg in half<br /><br />low doses on multiple sources are listed around 5 mg. common are on average around 15. most people find no need to dose over 20 mg. and very strong doses are around 25-30 mg.&nbsp; since your capsules will be twice what is recommended for a very strong dose, i just want to recommend trying to avoid anyone having a bad experience. it could just promote negative opinions or dangerous situations imo, but i am extremely concerned about the well being of others, in addition to always trying to promote responsible, safe drug use. just at least please consider this request

				Yeah i hear ya man but im sure we&#039;re all responsible adults and educated drug users here like? Ill add &quot;double dose&quot; to the add now too, I also mention in the first line of the Ad&nbsp; twice that they are a heavy dose and to be careful, i say...<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;5 strong does (50-56mg 2C-i) in pink and white size 3 capsules, take care as these are quite strong if you haven&#039;t swam with the 2c&#039;s before!&quot; so thats a fair enough waring for any adult i think? i took 60mg last wknd in one go and thought it was downright amazing, my mate took a 50mg and loved it too. <br /><br />ill be making 25mg ones tonight for the lesser tolerant people though man and ones with 80mg MDMA and 25mg 2c-i in them too, which is an absolutely amazing combination imo!<br /><br />Peace

				i honestly didnt check the add, so at least you mention that its about twice a normal dose<br /><br />you are right too though, most people with experience can probably 50 mg and isnt too likely to kill anyone or anything just that i dont think it is wise to assume the only people taking the caps will get them directly from you and read the warning<br /><br />plus we are definitely not all responsible adults on the site unfortunately<br /><br />irresponsible adolescents have the same access to your products, not that adults are necessarily any more responsible.<br /><br />you would not believe the amount of people that seriously inquire asking about the joke in my signature. i tell people to do research on chems they want to ingest - but they still request my samples (that i am not really offering) of mptp - which is a freaking precursor to a neurotoxin that causes parkinsons symptoms and death! people will sadly unwittingly kill themselves if given the opportunity <br /><br />i just dont want anyone to further bad publicity about the site, chems, or hurt themselves especially... sorry for kinda trying to suggest you do something, hope you didnt take it the wrong way
