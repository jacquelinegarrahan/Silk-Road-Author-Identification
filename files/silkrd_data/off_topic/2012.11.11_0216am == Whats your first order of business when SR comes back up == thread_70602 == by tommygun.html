				For me I&#039;m spending a good chunk of BTC, don&#039;t want that much sitting in there again.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason why buyer advice is to only deposit what you plan to spend asap, now I get it :)&nbsp; <br /><br />That and maybe order to a couple fake addresses lol

				Order 50g of Blow that I&#039;ve wanted to do since Friday lol. <br /><br />And gutted Nugsy, I did all my orders and posted them out just before the site dropped out so I don&#039;t have anything to do when it comes back. What I am going to do instead however, and what I am having quite a lot of fun doing now is watching all this drama unfold and see some of the retarded comments that are emerging.

				Start praying that the vendor I ordered a half oz of MMJ from can get it out in a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; It would have been really awesome if he could have shipped it within the two days after I placed the order, which was two days before the site went down.&nbsp; Not like it says on his vending page he gets packages out the same business day or next or anything...&nbsp; Now I&#039;m waiting over a week on a package that I really really need.&nbsp; What bad timing. :/&nbsp; Here&#039;s to hoping everyone&#039;s vendors are able to ship things out in a reasonable, timely manner, and we&#039;re all able to get our goods asap.<br /><br />LONG LIVE SR!
