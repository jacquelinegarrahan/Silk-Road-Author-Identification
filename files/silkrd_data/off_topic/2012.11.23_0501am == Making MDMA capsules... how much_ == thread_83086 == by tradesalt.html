				I recently got some clean, tan molly shards, and I put 120mg of the sandy/slightly shardy pieces in a size #1 capsule (already a small looking cap) and it looks like a tiny, tiny amount in there. Since there is no filler, I am wondering if people are going to eyeball it and think &quot;you skimped out on me you sketchy fuck!&quot; When in fact 120mg is a damn good amount of clean crystal.<br /><br />What are your experiences/habits with moving capsules of molly?

				if people know what they are looking at and you tell them the weight, you will have no issues. i know people who out put 80mg in their caps and sell them as &quot;points&quot;. at the same time though, we would sometimes fill the caps as a half gram, just to move larger amounts in a club or something, but if you do that, make sure the person understands it is not meant for them to take the whole thing!

				Thanks for the feedback guys, I appreciate it.<br /><br />Problem is that I am already using size 1 capsules which are tiny. In addition, they don&#039;t make capsule filling machines which are any good for size #2 or #3, and filling caps individually takes way more time than it is worth. If I cant fill 25 or more capsules in a go, it is to inefficient. <br /><br />I am thinking of maybe mixing in a small amount of caffeine powder, as most people typically like a less mongy and slightly more energetic roll. I would explain this to any buyers, as I have nothing to hide - I like my rolls like that too.

				Don&#039;t use caffeine, instead try something like dextrose. It&#039;s cheap (like 3-4$/kilo) and doesn&#039;t give a nasty comedown like caffeine.

				Knomo, thank you for your insights. I actually have used dextrose from the store here in producing mushrooms before, so I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t think of that. You are the man, thank you for sharing you wisdom. I want to do right by my customers. You&#039;re a huge help.

				A good cut in MDMA caps would be something like vitamin C or vitamin E powder. At least that would help with some of the neurotoxic effects of MDMA. Not overly expensive ether. :)

				Hi guys,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been making MDMA caps for awhile with size 0 capsules. I&#039;ve come most people prefer 125mg, which is convenient considering that is an 1/8 of a gram. You just have to know what to expect with ~100mg of a substance. it isn&#039;t very much once you get accustomed to weight. MDA for example is pretty volumetric compared to MDMA, but at the same weight in my findings. Size 1 doesn&#039;t fit my machine. <br /><br />Sometimes I use an excipient filler such as a lactose, but most people I know prefer just plain substance. <br /><br />It all comes down to many variables, such as the size of the cap as well, thus giving the perception of smallness. A person will eat less if given a small plate, but eat more if given a bigger one. A wider glass looks more full than a tall one with the same volume. Why? Perception. Just know what to expect. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also been tinkering around with these formulas, which have all been made in small batches and for the most part tested. Some stolen from trip reports on erowid and this and other forums adjusted to the average per pound user IMO. <br /><br />Scale accurate within 3-5mg:<br /><br />2C-B 25mg capsules (~22-27mg)<br />MDA 125mg capsules (~125mg)<br />MDA 125mg +12.5mg methamphetamine capsules (~138mg)<br />MDMA 125mg capsules (~125mg)<br />MDMA 125mg + 20mg 2C-B capsules (~145mg)<br />MDMA 125mg + 12.5mg methamphetamine capsules (~138mg)<br />MDMA 100mg + MDA 50mg capsules (~150mg)<br />MDMA 100mg + MDA 50mg + 10mg methamphetamine capsules (~160mg)<br />MDMA 100mg + MDA 50mg + 50mg cocaine + 10mg methamphetamine capsules (210mg)

A person will eat less if given a small plate, but eat more if given a bigger one. A wider glass looks more full than a tall one with the same volume. Why? Perception. Just know what to expect. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also been tinkering around with these formulas, which have all been made in small batches and for the most part tested. Some stolen from trip reports on erowid and this and other forums adjusted to the average per pound user IMO. <br /><br />Scale accurate within 3-5mg:<br /><br />2C-B 25mg capsules (~22-27mg)<br />MDA 125mg capsules (~125mg)<br />MDA 125mg +12.5mg methamphetamine capsules (~138mg)<br />MDMA 125mg capsules (~125mg)<br />MDMA 125mg + 20mg 2C-B capsules (~145mg)<br />MDMA 125mg + 12.5mg methamphetamine capsules (~138mg)<br />MDMA 100mg + MDA 50mg capsules (~150mg)<br />MDMA 100mg + MDA 50mg + 10mg methamphetamine capsules (~160mg)<br />MDMA 100mg + MDA 50mg + 50mg cocaine + 10mg methamphetamine capsules (210mg)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this is rather interesting.how well does the mdma + 2cb go down with each other?<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very nice indeed. Although I prefer to take the 2c-b as the mdma peak is wearing off. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />im going to have to try it,is it more enjoyable than taking 2cb on its own? 8)

				What would you guys recommend adding to ~100mg of mdma to make it more of an energetic roll.&nbsp; Preferably something that won&#039;t keep me up for days.
