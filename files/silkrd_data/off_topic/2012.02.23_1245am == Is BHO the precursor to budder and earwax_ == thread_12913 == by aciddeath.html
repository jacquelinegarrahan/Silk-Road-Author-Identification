				Can someone clue me in here...<br />I have read multiple articles and seen multiple videos on making earwax from bho and &quot;budder&quot;<br /><br />So what&#039;s the deal? <br />Is ISO hash / BHO the starting point to budder or earwax?

				Iso-hash and BHO are completely different. Dunno if youre referring to Isolator Hash or concentrates made from Isopropyl alcohol based extraction, but theyre still different.&nbsp; All the &quot;iso hash&quot; ive had has been solid, whereas BHO is obviously liquid.&nbsp; As far as the relationship between BHO and Budder, from my experience Budder is just a term for fluffy, whipped concentrate made just like BHO.&nbsp; I think earwax is something like that as well, but I&#039;ve never run across anything called that.&nbsp; Hope that helped at least a little!

				grandaddyturtle!<br />You are correct isohash and BHO are completely different -- the primary different being the solvents used to extract the THC.<br />Again, &#039;isolater&#039; hash refers to hash made using a &quot;cold water extraction&quot; method whereby all the non-soluable oils (THC!!) fall through what equates to different micron size silk screen.<br /><br />I will have to disagree with you that BHO is liquid.<br />BHO is only liquified when the&nbsp; temperature is raised. At room temperature BHO takes on a &#039;hard candy&#039; texture that (when using high quality starting material) can be translucent/amber. If you squish a piece of good BHO in your fingers to warm it up you can turn it into a translucent flat piece<br /><br />All of the budder videos/pictorials I have seen show the same process you describe, heating and whipping the concentrate until it turns into a more waxy consistency. I believe that is where the term earwax is derived from, looks like earwax<br /><br />I read some article on hightimes about &#039;budderman&#039; and his &#039;extremely secret highly researched recipe&#039; but it mostly sounded like nonsense after reading through the pictorials/videos

				Earwax and the shit here in the dispensaries in the US is just whipped or dried out fluffed honey oil essentially, stripped in a tube with butane extraction and then vac purged a few times if it&#039;s really high quality.

				Budder is whipped BHO. They make the oil, purge it accordingly, then whip it with a small tool under some heat so it remains a liquid. Basically just creating pockets of air in the oil to make it easier to handle and dab, plus it looks 10000000x tastier. Not more potent, but usually of higher quality.
