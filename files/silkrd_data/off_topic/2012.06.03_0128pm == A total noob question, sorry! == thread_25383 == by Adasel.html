				Hi there guys, total noob here hoping to soon part with some bitcoins.<br />I thought it best to look around first, get a feel for the place and become a part of this cool community.<br />However, reading a lot of posts the term Finalize Early or FE, pops up a lot.<br />I may not know much about market transactions and the like, but could someone help clear things up for me?<br />

				Hi,<br /><br />FE is basically you finalise the transaction before you have received your shipment...<br /><br />Usually as a measure of secuirty we use escrow on here where as once you receive the shiment and confirm it online the money will be released to the vendor but with FE you are sending him before you receive the shipment...so you kind of lose that advantage or secuirty you had if you did not receive the money or the product was a scam then you could get your money back but with FE you can not<br /><br />Since your a new guy a lot of vendors will ask you to FE but if you go with domestic vendors they should be cool with you using escrow unless it&#039;s big amounts just go with good vendors that have a good reputation and look on the forums to see the reviews aswell bro you should be fine

				Vlad, thankyou very much mate.<br />I was thinking about using some &quot;test&quot; money.&nbsp; Not that i dont trust anyone or anything but surely you can understand someone in my position, using a service for the first time.<br />What sort of rate could you give me on, lets say, £50 for arguments sake?<br />
