				recently heard<br />the story goes, she was a stripper on the side and when her newspaper found out she was fired.<br />after some time she released a book title &quot;story on an angry stripper&quot;<br /><br />a news presenter commented to the effect, &quot;what&nbsp; is it about being a stripper that stops you from being a good journalist&quot;<br /><br />- isn&#039;t that what we&#039;ve been saying all along about designer drugs or generally getting high?!<br /><br />- forget for a second the view drugs are far more harmful blah blah blah, its the same point &quot;of course you could still hold a job&quot;, but being<br />&nbsp; a journalist / stripper is far more topical and makes interesting news!<br /><br />i cant wait for the opportunity to use this analogy in conversation haha.<br /><br /><br />Peace<br />

I think in her case it was about the fact that she was in a position where she had to be seen to be a good role model to young girls she was teaching. Also if the boys at the school had found out she&#039;d never have heard the end of it!<br /><br />It surprises me a bright woman who&#039;s a Journalist would want to be a stripper anyway. I suppose it must be about the money at the end of the day. Shame we men can&#039;t pull in so many Benjamins by standing around in our underwear! :-)<br /><br />V.

I for one would never complain. ;D
