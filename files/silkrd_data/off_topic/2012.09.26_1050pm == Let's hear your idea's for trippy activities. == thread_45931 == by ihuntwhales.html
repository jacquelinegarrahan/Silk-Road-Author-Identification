				Well, we all know everyone has their own favorite series of activities to perform during their trip. Some like engaging in introspective thought or conversation, others enjoy listening to music, some even enjoy going to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World and riding space mountain after consuming an eighth of shrooms (this guy).<br /><br />However, I&#039;m looking for some good ol&#039; fashioned fun during my trips. I&#039;ve always liked light shows but have only been in a couple situations to where kids were actually performing them. So here is my list of things I intend to do while on the psychedelic mindset. Please feel free to add any ideas that I haven&#039;t come across yet. (P.S Not all of these are meant to be innovative or wild ideas, i.e listening to music.)<br /><br />Successful Ideas:<br />- Spin glowsticks<br />- Glow bubbles (Break open a glowstick, obtain bubble wand, blow glow in the dark bubbles...mind fucks the rookies every time.)<br />- Music (Also would like any music preferences or suggestions for mindblowing trippy shit. I tend to listen to a very wide variety so I&#039;m open for anything except the hell screeches people call &quot;country music&quot;)<br />- Visiting an amusement park (granted you can keep composure)<br />- Haunted house<br />- Going to see a movie in IMAX 3D and sitting in the front row. (Let me just say, thanks to 40 Mg of 2C-I taken before seeing The Avengers at midnight, for two hours of my life I was Tony Stark)<br />- Sex. (Depending on how kinky of a person you are, you may want to wait to come down off the peak before you start off on any lustful adventures, but my god is it worth it if you don&#039;t)<br />- Visiting a museum (Wyoming Dinosaur Center is the best I can think of)<br />- Longboarding (I don&#039;t longboard and I see a lot of potential pain involved here, but a few people I know will longboard the entire god damn time so it must be entertaining)<br />- Planetarium (Gotta say, this one was badass, be prepared for liftoff) <br />- Skydiving (ONE DAY)<br /><br />DON&#039;T FUCKING DO IT ideas:<br />- Driving (It is fun, but so is fucking prostitutes...and we all know how that goes, am I right!?.....right?<br />- Going to a party (Unless combining alcohol and any of the 2C series, which we call either hulk mode or psychedelic cocaine, being around drunk people when you&#039;re tripping is the most uncomfortable and annoying shit ever. They are loud, belligerent, careless, repulsive, and you will end up seeing a lot of your friends in a way that you didn&#039;t want to.)<br />- Jumping off a bridge into water (Just don&#039;t do it. I know one of you fuckers has considered it...p.s it&#039;s awesome)<br />-Swimming (depends on the psychedelic)<br /><br /><br />Would anyone care to add to the lists?<br />-<br /><br />Would anyone care to add to the list?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been to a planetarium on 5-MeO-MiPT. Intense shit. Planning on doing it again after snorting 1-2mg of 25i ;D<br />Lasers are fun too.
