				Yes folks it&#039;s one of these annoyingly subjective questions, but with a slight twist:<br /><br />PLEASE STATE IF YOU HAVE/HAVE NOT DONE DMT IN SOME FORM YET.<br /><br />Thanks.

				lucy is my favorite<br /><br />dmt is nuts, but too intense for me, it can mindfuck you to the point of insanity...<br /><br />lsd, is much more forgiving. very loving and very beautifu<br /><br />mescaline, is the simliar but completely different then lsd, nothing but love and beauty and awe<br /><br />ketamine is just freaking awesome and fun <br /><br /><br /><br />i never like to pick favorites, all psychedelics heal me. but if i had to choose....<br /><br />1. LSD<br />2. Mescaline <br />3. Ketamine

				My favorites starting from:<br /><br />1. lsd is king. there is absolutely nothing that comes close in my opinion. mixes well with pretty much almost everything and to me it is the ultimate substance for everything, but especially for festivals and raves<br /><br />Weed is something i will smoke and eat until i die. I can&#039;t imagine ever being without it or not around it. <br /><br />Dmt is epic, i love it because of its short duration, i can do it daily and enter the psychedelic state of mind when i don&#039;t have time to drop long lasting psychedelics. But this is something i do when i am home alone chilling out. i love doing it while on lsd :)<br /><br />Shrooms are fun, never ending giggles for me, i like them especially somewhere around 2 - 3.5 grams while drinking tons of alcohol :) THey are also very fun with K(if i don&#039;t have booze) or mdma (although i honestly grew out of mdma, i like mda mucch more :))<br /><br />Ketamine is amazing, i love it but it does not compare to the ones above. <br /><br />Mescaline is rad but its too mellow for my likes, i have only consumed via san pedro cactus and i have drank a lot of horrible tasting liquid and have not tripped nearly as hard as i have on mushrooms or lsd. I am still hoping to find good shit one day so i can really go out there :)<br /><br />RC&#039;s: Some are better than others, from the ones i have done my faves have been 4 aco dmt and 2cb. straight up epic, but i&#039;d rather do lsd.<br /><br />It was hard for me to come up w/ this but here is a rough list of my preferences. I must say i&#039;m very high and i probably forgot some good shit along the way. There is too much good stuff out there!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I always go by to mushroom.<br />My favorite in terms of duration and sensation.<br />I always end up in nature and feeling connected.

				:( feeling left out, still not tried DMT however im gonna be a rebel and answer anyway! but i feel there could be a slight caveat here, mt preferred is generally shrooms, but that may be down to two things, first is that they were the very first psych i ever took so i have fond memories (it was a truly epic experience and on xmas eve too! the story of that trip is a great one, maybe one day ill post it up somewhere) second is that by a huge margin ive taken more shrooms than any other psych ive ever had so i know exactly how to get the best from my shroom trip, there is definitely something to be said for &quot;mastering&quot; a psych if you will, but that may well all change once i get some of that changa or some mesc or some DOx, god damn i need more money, this list is still way too long im also very very keen to get some of either 4-aco-dmt or 4-ho-dmt, may have to have a pm to swish see if he doesnt have some stashed thats not listed! (and for those that have tried it how does it compare to shrooms)<br /><br />@watmm<br /><br />psychs in general and control freaks dont mix, you just gotta let go and go with the flow, its the advice i give to anyone taking a psych for the first time, never ever try and fight or control it, thats something that only comes with experience

				My top 3: <br /><br />1. Ayahuasca <br />2. Shrooms <br />3. Mescaline <br /><br />I have yet to try pure DMT, LSD, Salvia and MXE / KET. Silk Road makes this possible.
