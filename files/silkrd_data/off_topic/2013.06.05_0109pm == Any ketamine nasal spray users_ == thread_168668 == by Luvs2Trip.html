				Ok so i read that you could do ketamine in a nasal spray and this interested me a lot as it said it makes it more effective!<br /><br />I&#039;ve scanned the forums and the internet and found a good link that tells you how to make ketamine nasal spray<br /><br />*Clearnet* http://www.legalhighguides.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=5389<br /><br />I just find the whole thing strange because it would appear to only have benefits such as less pain on the nose, no blocked nose, more absorbent, and better effect (all this is from what i have read). But I have known a lot of K users and never seen any of them adapt this method!<br /><br />Is there anyone on here that uses this method and can maybe answer some questions for me?<br /><br />A) Is the effect of the nasal spray the same as doing plain old lines<br />B) Whats the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s if any<br />C) Could you just buy a saline spray and mix the ketamine with the saline mixture that&#039;s already in there?

				I used this for heroin.&nbsp; It worked okay, but had post-nasal drip.&nbsp; Also I think I over-dilluted it.<br /><br />With K I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned about post-nasal drip, because it does work orally, though with less bioavailability.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not too concerned with dosing amounts, I think a nasal spray would be a good way to go; especially since one technique of usage is to just take small amounts of K until the user reaches the type of high they&#039;re after.&nbsp; For more accurate dosing use a syringe, minus the needle (up the nose), instead of a sprayer up the nose.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m going to start myself on low-dosing K, and will probably start with lines.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be concerned about dose.&nbsp; If I could easily get my hands on a syringe I would try that.<br /><br /><br />-PB

				What&#039;s a good OTC nasal spray where it is easy to open up the bottle to add the ketamine (or other drug)?&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to give this a try.&nbsp; I usually inject my ketamine though.&nbsp; Way better absorption than insufflation and no nasty back drip.
