				I am very grateful for being able to use this awesome site. And I know I sound like a whiner, but I implore to the operators at SR, could you please invest in some new servers that won&#039;t be overloaded 50% of the time, or more??? I&#039;m sure a good deal of you feel the same as I do. If I&#039;m crying over this to much...let me know. Maybe I&#039;m missing something here. For all you computer geniuses, could you explain how this can be fixed?

				Not sure but maybe you haven&#039;t read all the other posts hehe...<br /><br />We are under a DDoS attack....<br /><br />Below is from DPR<br /><br />UPDATE (05/03/2013 0545 UTC): The attacks have been coming non-stop since my last update.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been able to keep the site open more than half the time with only minor issues such as limited image uploading for vendors.&nbsp; Every hour we are making progress and I am feeling much more confident that we will come out on top within the next few days.&nbsp; Still, expect some unannounced down-time here and there.<br /><br />UPDATE (05/01/2013 0238 UTC): Silk Road is open and accessible.&nbsp; As soon as the attacker finds out, he will likely change his tactics and try to take the site down again.&nbsp; Hopefully he won&#039;t be able to, but time will tell.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/30/2013 2022 UTC): Still working on a solution.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t given up hope that we will be able to go forward as a public market without limiting access.&nbsp; We are putting all of our efforts into making that a reality.&nbsp; If that changes, I will let you know here.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/30/2013 0035 UTC): We have come a long way in the battle, but still do not have the upper hand.&nbsp; It&#039;s looking more and more like a restructuring of the tor software or even the tor network will be required to mitigate the kind of attack we are under.&nbsp; If this can be solved by modifying the tor client software running the silk road .onion, then it will be a matter of patching and redeploying the hidden service.&nbsp; If it is a network issue, it will require the cooperation of the Tor developers, or running a new network of nodes.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t given up hope for a faster solution, but if one can not be found, then we will move to a semi private scheme where users will be given access through many private URLs.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep everyone updated on how we will move forward, but please be prepared for a few more days at the least of no access.<br /><br />UPDATE (04/29/2013 0715 UTC): Just want to let you all know I&#039;m still here and we&#039;re still doing battle behind the scenes to get the forums and main site running again.&nbsp; It is incredibly discouraging to have everything we&#039;ve worked so hard for taken down by some anonymous and malevolent person, but your kind words of encouragement do wonders for our moral.&nbsp; We are on the cutting edge of anonymity technology here.&nbsp; The attacks being used against us MUST be overcome if Silk Road and any anonymous public sites are to have a future.&nbsp; Thank you again for your patience with all of this, and pray that we make it through stronger than we started.<br /><br />We are being attacked once more.&nbsp; This time the forums are under attack as well.&nbsp; Access is intermittent, so hopefully some of you can read this.&nbsp; We are doing everything possible to overcome this latest attack.&nbsp; Please be patient while we find a solution.
