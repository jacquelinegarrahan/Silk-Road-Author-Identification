				good afternoon everyone, how are you all on this dreary day? just thought id say a quick hello before diving straight into asking any dealers from the UK able to supply good weed and MDMA? also I see some gloriously awesome looking thc lollipops for sale, are these any good? as id like to go around the streets getting stoned with no one knowing :D also before I posted about anxiety issues and being a bit socially awkward in some instances even though im a salesmen (kinda funny really) its more a hot itchy rash around the neck and gritting of teeth and just wanting to crawl and hide somewhere for 1000 years =p. im also after something that kind of &quot;removes&quot; the side of me that cares as such, so I can concentrate on selling and studying (student too) what wonderdrug would you guys and gals reccommend. <br /><br />looking forward to getting to know you all!

				benzos, or amphets.<br /><br />thc tends to make me even more introverted and quiet. but speed gets me yacking.. if you take too much you can always pop a few benzos to sleep (even though that&#039;s a really bad cycle to get into, and can destroy your life if you let it).<br /><br />if you&#039;re looking for therapeutics and you have health insurance i&#039;d just go see a doctor, you can get all kinds of amphets and benzos prescribed to you and probably at a cheaper price than here.

				Yo just do some meth! But not too often, lol. It&#039;s excellent for what you described, removing social awkwardness, helping you concentrate, et cetera. <br /><br />As far as THC lollipops, VortexMilkMan has them I&#039;m pretty sure, and I&#039;ve never tried them but I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re great. And VortexMilkMan is a fucking amazing vendor!<br /><br />But the UK is like the best place to get MDMA so I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll have any trouble finding some lol.<br /><br />WELCOME TO SILK ROAD!

				Hi, for those anxiety issues, you should probably go see a doctor. My doc prescribed me bupropion, which I see as very useful, and yes, you just give less of a fuck about things, also you&#039;re overall more awake and in a better mood. Its effects resemble Ritalin.<br />I do smoke weed though, but I can only really enjoy it on my own, since I become very introverted.
