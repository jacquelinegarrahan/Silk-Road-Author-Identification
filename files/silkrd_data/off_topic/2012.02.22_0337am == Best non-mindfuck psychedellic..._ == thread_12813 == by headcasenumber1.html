				I&#039;d like to take a poll to find my perfect fix.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of my favorite drugs experiences were coming down after a night of excessive MDMA use back in my early 20&#039;s.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used much in the past 10 years, yet I&#039;m hoping to find a drug or drug combo that has similar effects (perhaps without the excessive MDMA use).&nbsp; What I really liked what that I had a semi-psychedelic experience, almost 100% visual with almost no mind fucking.&nbsp; The visuals were very realistic, almost felt like being in a movie.&nbsp; &nbsp; I could (if I really wanted to) turn the visuals on and off, which was really nice as well. <br /><br />I&#039;m very sensitive to drugs with a mind trip (LSD/Shroooms/Even weed) and generally don&#039;t enjoy them.<br /><br />So... is there any such substance or mix of substances that would be the perfect match for me?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Bump.<br /><br />I am also interested in finding out the answer to this question.<br /><br />I get too anxious and paranoid to smoke weed anymore. I used to abuse it daily for around 5 years or so and became too wary of developing some kind of psychosis, so I quit and have never looked back.<br /><br />I love the visuals and deep philosophical thoughts that I get with LSD, but I sometimes find myself feeling very tense and exhausted on this drug, with seriously uncomfortable bodyload during the comedown.<br /><br />It would be great to have a list of alternative psychedelics to experiment with.

				&quot;(LSD/Shroooms/Even weed) and generally don&#039;t enjoy them.&quot;<br />if you don&#039;t like psychedelics then don&#039;t do them.. they aren&#039;t for everybody. <br />Some may disagree but as far as chill psychedelics go i recommend mescaline.

				I think the psychedelic experience by definition is a mindfuck..Just the degree you&#039;re mindfucked really depends on the dose.<br /><br />For example, maybe you&#039;re just experiencing a mild expansive headspace where the deeper layers and intricacies of your own thoughts are rendered more clearly. Or you can get so fucked up you forget who you are as an individual, becoming one with the universe and having incomprehensibly complex ideas shown to you through an infinitely detailed flowing fractal lexicon. :p<br /><br />The psychedelic phenomenon is a sacred gift, and damn useful tool. You mustah rern to frow with-ah the mindfukuru, young grasshoppah. Seriously. Having your ego&#039;s self-important dick kicked around can be an invigorating and fun experience. :p

				From personal experience some of the 2c&#039;s have the properties you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />For me 2C-E caused no mind fuck, however for some people the body load and nausea can be unpleasant. I never felt the nausea while on it and the body effects never amounted to anything more than some muscle tension.<br /><br />I may not be the best person to use as an example for this though since I didn&#039;t seem to get much mind fuck on shrooms or LSD either...

				I must just be weird then. Even with large doses 2ce didn&#039;t cause what I would consider mind fuck. I suppose I tend to have a very high tolerance for psychedelics though, so that&#039;s probably why I didn&#039;t get mind fucked.

				Due to recent FF (Nombe 25i) mistake, I would recommend Nombe.&nbsp; Took it at a rave and had a great fucking time.&nbsp; Mostly visuals, with very little of my mind spinning out of control or the tortuous introspection (Glad I experienced it) towards the end of trip.<br /><br />Also, love ketamine when coming down from MDMA.&nbsp; It kind of restarts it for me and then you get some good visuals.

				I recently tried 2C-P and thought it was very visual without the mindfuck nature of LSD. However, I only tried it once so limited experience there. Additionally it is rather long lasting so it may not be for you... Also I&#039;ve heard that 2C-E is very &#039;clinical&#039; so that doesn&#039;t sound like it&#039;d be a good choice (think I saw that on Erowid)

				others disagree with me but from personal experience i find 2C-B the most clear headed trip ive taken especially if you dont nail loads of it, also 25i nbome is very visual with lesser mind fuck, but i certainly wouldnt say AMT, i found that one of the most mind screwing drugs ive taken, i spent hours utterly convinced that if i just concentrated a little harder i could phase my hand through an envelope and pull the letter inside out without ever opening it, there wasnt much in the way of visuals but it was a night of some very very odd thoughts and ideas. as for 2C-E it isnt massively head trippy and has a lot of visuals, but its also very body load heavy and did make me sick. <br /><br />to be honest it sounds like psychedelics arent really youre cup of tea. however you mentioned mdma or rather the tail end of it, i know its not nearly as visual as lsd or the 2c-x compounds but maybe MDA could be the way to go (when you take mdma around 6% of it is converted by your liver into mda so that may have been what you were getting) youre not going to get mad patterning and such of a full psychedelic but itll give you the eye wiggles and sparkles at least. as grandthefttaco said above if you want to go down the trip route just ease in and learn to go with it, the mind fuck is part of the fun. alternatively you could preload with a mild benzo, it will lower the visuals some but itll help ease youre anxiety and maybe help you enjoy the trip<br /><br />

				I have to agree with Foxy here, AMT is absolutely amazing. The Soviets used to use it as an experimental anti-depressant in the 60&#039;s i think.<br /><br />Complete Euphoria is the only way i can describe it, ive never ever been so happy. I did it at a 40mg dose, lasted 12 hours (about 2-3 to really come up) and i slept fine, had zero come down, woke up feeling happier than i did the day before i took it. <br /><br />In the UK it&#039;s legal and at 40mg doses i pay next to nothing a hit, its very cheap!<br /><br />

I also have 25C (2c-c is one of my favorite 2cs) and it is quite visual. &#039;<br /><br />25I is fantastic for a club!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I took a tab of Foxy&#039;s 25I last night and hit a club, had a blast- had incredibly coherent conversations and danced my ass off, made out with this cute asian girl, smoked a blunt- had a kick ass time jamming at my house after words just get down with it- i dont know how higher doses would be but, i was content at one tab and was normal as shit but my visuals were definatly a bit tripped out and i was feeling goofy as hell- planning on taking 2 tabs at a fest after I try out Skyys rolls next week

				I tried to get a sample from a very popular someone who lists that they give out samples on the forum, even paid for the postage.&nbsp; This was back on the 20th.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t want to bug this person but I sent a message and my order was never processed.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not going to fulfill sample orders then fucking remove them as a listing and stop wasting peoples time.&nbsp; I never tried an RC and thought it would be a cool way to sample.&nbsp; I&#039;m sick of fucking flakes or people who just don&#039;t give a shit.&nbsp; Either do what you&#039;re going to say or go fuck yourself.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I suggest 2c-i, I had a GREAT time on it and NO mindfuck at all.<br />Also, if you really want to be fucked (visually) then I&#039;ve HEARD that mixing 2c-i with DXM is fun and has a very low mental load.

				Any vendors want to turn me on to an RC sample.&nbsp; Like Methylone or something cool.&nbsp; I&#039;m really hoping to get into the RC scene but would like to try some of this shit out first before laying out big BTC.&nbsp;
