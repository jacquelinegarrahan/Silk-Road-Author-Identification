				I just want to vent here for a second about my frustrations so please indulge me for one minute.<br /><br />Over the past few years it seems that my stomach has become the most sensitive piece of shit in the world.&nbsp; It seems to me now that almost ANY drug I consume orally besides cannabis causes me to vomit after a period of time.<br /><br />Tonight I tried doing some pharmahuasca.&nbsp; Consumed 250mg of Harmine HCL.&nbsp; Then 20 minutes later 130mg of rogerpete&#039;s DMT.&nbsp; 40 minutes later - puking my guts out and dry heaving.&nbsp; Just great.&nbsp; The experience was still nice but of course did not last as long as I hoped.&nbsp; So i consumed 70mg more when it started to wear out.&nbsp; An hour after that back in the bathroom.&nbsp; Usually I can take more of whatever it is after the first time getting sick and handle it.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t work with DMT.<br /><br />On NYE I consumed 200mg of The ILF&#039;s MDA.&nbsp; Was feeling awesome.&nbsp; Then an hour in same thing.&nbsp; Trip to the bathroom until I was dry heaving.&nbsp; This time it worked well enough to enjoy most of the night but FUCK.&nbsp; Ecstasy is one drug I haven&#039;t had as many issues with but seems like I&#039;ve lost that ability as well now.<br /><br />I have probably vomited at least 10g worth of mescaline up over the past few years .&nbsp; I used to waste so much because I would take an extra strong dose to make sure some if it stayed, and then consume more after the first time getting sick.&nbsp; Since mescaline lasts so long I&#039;ve gotten better at taking smaller doses and spacing it out to avoid wasting.&nbsp; But I still always get sick.<br /><br />I am not a big coke guy but just wanted to experiment in December a little bit.&nbsp; Snorting coke caused me to puke also.&nbsp; I have heard of this happening to others if they do too much but I don&#039;t think this was the case with me.&nbsp; Just my stupid stomach.&nbsp; At least it seems to tolerate me blowing lines of K without issue.<br /><br />When I used to smoke weed more heavily and then go on trips where I had to break for a while I would go through withdrawal and start puking in the mornings if I had even one single beer the night before.<br /><br />And it goes on and on.... but it doesnt even stop with drugs....<br /><br />If I get a good whiff of dog shit or piss I now sometimes start gagging out loud.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ever actually start throwing up but still WTF.&nbsp; Many other smells cause this too.<br /><br />So anyway that&#039;s my story and thanks for listening.&nbsp; It is really frustrating to me and I really wish there was something I could do but I really dont think there is.&nbsp; Should I visit my doctor and tell him that my stomach is not letting me consume drugs properly?&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Anyone else dealing with this sort of stupid bullshit?<br /><br />One of my good friends was born without a gag reflex and has never vomited in his entire life.&nbsp; It has definitely caused him to be in some shitty situations at times when he did consume too much of whatever but I envy him so much.

				Hey I don&#039;t do drugs, I prefer to wait for other to do them and then I have sex with them when they are helpless. But that&#039;s not why I am posting. I wanted to suggest you might try two things:<br /><br />1. Get some anti-nausea meds and take them forst. That works for me if I am having a bad stomach day.<br /><br />2. Try taking the oral stuff anally. No joke, it might work. Probably others could comment. But I would prefer sticking some random powder in my ass to throwing up! I hate throwing up more than I hate prostate exams.<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying.<br /><br />Modzi

				Thanks for the ideas.&nbsp; I never thought of anti-nausea medicine.&nbsp; Might have to give that a try.<br /><br />To be honest the act of puking is not what bothers me.&nbsp; I do it so often now it is just a part of life.<br /><br />I just hate the fact that I am wasting stuff I paid money for but more importantly that the experiences don&#039;t last as long as they could.<br /><br />Not sure I am ready to shove anything up my ass quite yet.&nbsp; I heard of many people doing this with ecstasy back in the day and always thought they were crazy.&nbsp; Wonder if I will turn into one of those crazies soon!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				2 week course of prilosec 40mg per day. just take it when you wake up and don&#039;t eat for an hour. if it&#039;s your tummy and not the redic amount of shit you&#039;re taking everytime, that should help fix it and at least delay you completely destroying your tummy. good luck.

				hey did you consider smoking weed? It works for some people. THC has its antinausea effect (when not overdosed).<br /><br />Speaking of me. I thought my stomach is strong &#039;cause when almost everyone of my co-trippers puke from clean dxm I just feel uncomfortable on my belly for ~30 minutes.. but this year I tried fly agarics (dried, boiled, dried AND boiled, all recipes I found) - and I puke 100% after ~2 hours. Effect is weak and I ALWAYS vomit. <br /><br />Also, kissel may do the job. It makes your stomach less sensitive to chafe. Good luck man.

				So as far as plugging at clubs go it may or may not be dooable. You have to figure some folks IV or toke at clubs and most of them just hit up a private spot. If you were to find plugging works for you it could be as simple as having a little oral syringe with you and taking your dose in the bathroom. Once you do it a couple times in a safe spot, you&#039;ll figure out how to get it in there and out without leaking all the goodies.<br /><br />I never feel the need to poop after I do it personally. We&#039;re talking about a thimble full of water so it&#039;s not exactly a huge amount of anything going up there. I know some people just shove pills up there and often report that they need to go take a dump but I think that has more to do with a solid pill being in there then a tiny amount of liquid. I&#039;ve heard most of it gets absorbed within just a few minutes so as long as you can clench down for a little bit you should be fine. Like I said before though try it at home first, I can see it being a little odd if you do it at a club a drug fart on the dance floor but has never happened to me or my girl.<br /><br />If you want to try it with other drugs just do a search for plugging (drug name). You&#039;ll normally end upo on bluelight.ru and almost always see a bunch of people flaming the idea and one or two people that have tried it and can say if it works or not. Most anything that is able to be taken orally can be taken rectally. I&#039;ve done, MDMA, MDA, 2CB, Ambien, stuff like that and never had an issue. Have heard Heroin and Meth go up the bum pretty well.<br /><br />Anyway, give it a go sometime, you don&#039;t even have to tell anyone you did it. But if it makes the stomach happy and gets you where you want to go it&#039;s worth a shot.<br /><br />Good luck!

				I&#039;ve always had a pretty shitty and weak stomach, albeit the only drugs I throw up with are DXM and Alcohol and when I do take either of those its a 95% chance so I know I will vomit at one stage of the night but eh..worth it sort of when I&#039;m dry.(I&#039;ve only done lsd, mdma, dxm and bud though so safe to assume any other nauseating drug I would throw up too lols)

				Wondering how you&#039;re feeling, and if you&#039;ve made any changes to your life to affect a positive change in your upper GI tract?<br /><br />I used to have to take all the prescription antacids for GERD when they started coming out. The first big one being Zantac, which was Rx only (US) for several years. I&#039;m talking my late 20&#039;s through my mid forties. My father who&#039;s still kickin, still takes them, but I don&#039;t. I&#039;ve just about totally eliminated coffee from my diet. I may get that one cup. 8 oz - not the giant one. Like once a week, if I&#039;m in the mood and the coffee is fresh. - Definitely stay away from that burnt overpriced shit at Starbucks. Though I hope that whole &quot;trend&quot; with &quot;barristers&quot; and the most emasculating way they want you to ask for coffee, has gone the way of MySpace. <br /><br />My gastroenterologist told me coffee was the biggest offender. He said you won&#039;t hear much bad about coffee because Coffee Lobbyists are like an extension of the drug cartels, only the legality makes it all the more cunning. He showed me a study where the majority of pancreatic cancer patients were overwhelmingly huge coffee consumers. A best friend who&#039;s a plumber by trade, I told this to, and he agreed, (a lot you can learn from a plumber!) He said, &quot;You should see what it does to the drains at coffee shops, and diners, 7-11&#039;s etc. The plaque that forms inside the coffee drain pipes, is almost impossible to remove, even with sulfuric acid.&quot; Usually he recommends they just replace them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Something to think about, though I wasn&#039;t vomiting, the cessation of massive amounts of coffee everyday, just to stay awake at work, was killing me. Now I tend to use baking soda and water to balance my ph, which also helps the absorption of amphetamine. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll go back to an alternate version of my initial advice. - If it makes ya puke? It&#039;s bad for ya! <br /><br />Last but not least, find a &quot;nutritionally oriented&quot; physician. Not necessarily homeopathic, because there are a lot of quacks in that group, who always have a certain brand of supplements available for purchase on a table in their office. <br /><br />Good health to you, and I hope you can resolve this issue in the year ahead. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				Thanks for sharing your experiences jagfug.&nbsp; <br /><br />I rarely drink coffee.&nbsp; When I used to be a pothead I would use a combination of coffee and weed to achieve this nice mental balance throughout the day but when I don&#039;t smoke weed if I drink coffee my mind goes crazy.&nbsp; And now I only smoke socially on occasion.&nbsp; Since I can&#039;t handle caffeine very well when sober I rarely consume coffee anymore.<br /><br />In general in life I am extremely healthy.&nbsp; I eat almost all organic foods.&nbsp; We belong to a CSA and have local farm fresh vegetables delivered every week.&nbsp; I eat very little meat.&nbsp; I don&#039;t work out too much.&nbsp; Just lift weights.&nbsp; But I go on a hike with my dog in the hills around here usually once a day for a little bit of movement.<br /><br />Most of the time my stomach is fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s really just bad smells that I think will always make me gag - and drugs which I can&#039;t consume.&nbsp; And yah, I know drugs are bad for me and this is why my body is trying to get rid of them.&nbsp; But my MIND loves them so it&#039;s frustrating.<br /><br />I have not yet taken any recommendations in this thread although the Alkaline water makes me very interested.&nbsp; I am going to order some natural bottles as was recommended - and then try out one of those devices that makes it naturally if I feel like it is making a difference.<br /><br />I also am strongly considering plugging mescaline the next time I trip on it.

				I can relate. Every time I do shrooms, I have to puke in the middle of the trip. Last time I thought the nauseous feeling would subside after a few minutes but it lasted for more than an hour, making my trip horrible.. Other than that, my metabolism messes up with most of my experiences, I can&#039;t seem to roll more than an hour and a half. I HATE THIS.

				Update to this thread..... I think I have fixed my problem.....<br /><br />My entire life I have always tried to either fast or eat very little when I take these harsh substances.&nbsp; I always thought processing the drugs quickly was the key to making it though without puking.&nbsp; But I am finding that when I have an extremely FULL stomach beforehand, that the slower digestion seems to fix my issue.<br /><br />I took 900mg of mescaline yesterday and did not throw up.&nbsp; On a very full stomach I took 350 at first, then another 350 about 75 minutes later.&nbsp; My friend and I were walking outside in the hills during this.&nbsp; About 15 minutes after taking the second dose I became nauseous.&nbsp; At this point I lied down and just laid at the sky and took in the view while eating fruit and nuts and drinking water.&nbsp; Each time I got up I wanted to throw up so I just kept lying there and eating more and more for about 30 minutes or so.&nbsp; Eventually the nausea subsided and we kept moving around a bit.&nbsp; My friend wasn&#039;t feeling very much at this point (he had only taken 400 on a full stomach as well) so I gave him another 250mg dose and took 200 for myself about 2.5 hours after the initial dose - mainly because I was so excited that I wasn&#039;t puking for once.<br /><br />We walked for a little bit more and then headed back to my house.&nbsp; I took a shower and at this point started realizing how hard I was already tripping - and that the last 200mg I took probably werent even affecting me at all yet.<br /><br />Man did I have a strong trip.&nbsp; I saw fractal patterns on everything.&nbsp; In all light.&nbsp; Even when&nbsp; tried to eventually go to sleep I was seeing fractal CEVs that I kept focusing on and trying to get closer to in order to see what they were truly composed of.<br /><br />Anyway, I think I have beaten my condition and the solution is EATING!<br /><br />Thanks everyone for your thoughts.
