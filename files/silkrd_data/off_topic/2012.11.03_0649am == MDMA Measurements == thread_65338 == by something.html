				Hey, I&#039;m relatively new to recreational drugs and I don&#039;t know much about the terminology. I&#039;ve only had MDMA sold to me as a &quot;point&quot; - whereas on SR everything appears to be sold in grams.<br /><br />What&#039;s the difference between these two? I just want to be able to compare the rates I get on here with the rates I can get through local means.

				Welcome to the wonderful world of drugs! A point is simply a tenth of a gram. On the street, grams tend to go for an average of $100, so a point would be around $10 usually. I&#039;m almost sure that the rates on SR are far better than anything you will get locally. Congratulations on getting here, and welcome to paradise.

				Haha, that&#039;s mental - we all paid ~60 for our point. We live and learn I guess - now to get on with not being charged too much.<br /><br />Best ways to search for prices on the forums? Things to look out for?<br /><br />And, as someone who&#039;s new to all of this, a good place to go to ask questions about safety and dosages? Not necessarily SR or TOR, but I have trouble finding sufficiently neutral sources at times.<br /><br />Thanks!
