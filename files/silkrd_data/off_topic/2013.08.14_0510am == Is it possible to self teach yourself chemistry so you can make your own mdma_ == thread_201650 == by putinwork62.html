				Yes, it is.<br /><br />Although learning how to do a tech, and then actually understanding the chemistry behind how that tech works are two totally different things. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend doing the latter however, as if you fuck up, you&#039;ll know why. You&#039;ll also have a mastery of the technique and will be able to improvise, and optimize what you&#039;re doing to achieve a higher quality product. <br /><br />If you really wanted to, you could learn the necessary chemistry within 6 months.

				Its possible to teach yourself anything including chemistry, or what you are going to want to research organic chemistry, Strike was self taught and there are many others, mind you it may be tougher than being able to be in an actual lab environment with other chemist teaching you, but there are many many resources out there.

				Thanks for the feedback guys i really appreciate it..... One quick question I would really like to learn chemistry in general because i love science but one thing i&#039;m worried about is the &quot;dangers&quot;, How do at home chemist protect themselves from danger when doing chemistry ?

				Teaching yourself basic chem would be a really difficult challenge with a lot of reading, but it is doable. <br /><br />You could also just read a basic tek. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this because if something along the lines goes wrong, there will be nothing you can do about it. A lot of meth lab explosions happen for this exact reasons, something goes wrong or people don&#039;t use required precautions and the chemicals react in a dangerous ways.

				If you are going to be pioneering new clandestine chemistry synthesis&#039;s then yes you need to know chemistry very well. If all you are trying to do is complete one of the hundreds of well-known and published synthesis&#039;s (which the vast majority of drugs come from) then all you need to know is how to read, follow directions, and learn how to use some lab equipment. In the case of MDMA, following BrightStars synthesis is not difficult if you can read and obtain the chemicals.

				I think if you just watch enough &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;&nbsp; you will know all that you need to know about chemistry.&nbsp; Wear a yellow suit, a filter/breather thing is a must (with two canister filters), and you will need a small revolver.&nbsp; Those are the basics; don&#039;t complicate it.&nbsp; If you can marry a blonde woman with huge tits, that helps obviously.

The &quot;guides&quot; he was selling were mere google searches of nothing special (someone emailed me a couple of them). And the sources were a fucking joke that would get anyone busted (which might explain why none of his minions are around). Funny thing was he was recommending overseas sources (you know what a big deal it is to get barrels of oil through customs???) when I knew of at least a half dozen sources here in the US you could get the same stuff from with cash and no ID! I will admit I was a bit curious about the peptide bonding he was alluding to with regards to LSD synthesis, but out of all the bs out of that guys mouth that was the only thing that peeked my interest (and for all I know that was bs too).

				Yes it is. If you are having a hard time teaching yourself there are general chemistry and organic chemistry classes at your local community college. As long as you are of average intelligence and willing to put in the work to learn chemistry you should have no problem.
