				So I happened to see a listing for SR t-shirts and got the thinking..<br /><br />Would wearing this shirt out in public be the equivalent of an undercover LE wearing an &quot;I&#039;m an undercover&quot;<br />shirt?<br /><br />Just seems ironic that with all the tor, BTC, PGP, and trying to stay as anonymous as possible, one would conjure such an idea.<br /><br />Not that I&#039;m trying to slam this vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;m just high and my thoughts are....well you know....&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I had the same thought. I wanted to buy a silk road shirt or a bitcoin shirt or something, but I know that&#039;s a bad idea. If you wanna stay safe, dress and act like a square. No &quot;legalize it&quot; shirts or dreadlocks or anything like that. Be as nerdy and white as possible and live a normal, upstanding life otherwise. That&#039;s my philosophy anyway.

				You know how your girlfriend has special outfits that she only wears behind closed doors when she is REALLY happy with the way you&#039;ve been acting lately?<br /><br />&nbsp;Not everything you like and own is worn in public.... come to think of it.. not everything you own and like is something other people even want to see ON you (or me :P )

				I believe the T-shirt just has Silkroad&#039;s Camel logo and no words.&nbsp; Only if someone knew that the Camel was Silkroad&#039;s logo, then would the user be identified.

				A little? Wow, WAY ahead of myself. Buuuut,<br /><br />I firmly believe that if the SR keeps growing as it is, and gaining support and funds (DPR was diving out 1000&#039;s of dollars in prizes for 2 days straight) it WILL be a force to be reckoned with. <br /><br />Some people only ever see the negative.

				Its not negativity, I would like nothing more than longevity for SR.<br /><br />But when you start talking about revolutions and freedom fighting shit...<br />You&#039;re talking about governments and LE that take down people like Pablo Escobar,<br />infiltrate terrorist organizations, invade countries and topple governments.<br /><br />Whatever though, everyone is entitled to their own opinions.&nbsp; More the power to you,<br />Where there&#039;s a will there&#039;s a way..<br /><br />In my opinion,<br />The first rule of SR: You don&#039;t talk about SR.

				Wearing an SR shirt is a VERY BAD idea.&nbsp; This goes against keeping a low profile.&nbsp; You kids who want to wear this shirt need to realize what you&#039;re involved in is not a joke and should learn to keep your mouths shut.&nbsp; &quot;oh I&#039;ll buy one, lol&quot; yeah real funny. You think it will give you cool points?&nbsp; Yeah tell your cell mate how cool it was when you wore that shirt.&nbsp; People who wear this shirt are the same people who have big mouths and brag to everyone about what they are doing.&nbsp; LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS, SHUT THE FUCK UP!&nbsp; Quit bragging, quit telling groups of people at parties.<br /><br />Think about it, you&#039;re in public telling everybody who sees you, &quot;I BUY DRUGS ONLINE&quot;&nbsp; What happens IF a cop sees you?&nbsp; What IF you get pulled over wearing it?&nbsp; Pretty sure you&#039;ll become a &quot;person of interest&quot;&nbsp; WTF, why not just go turn yourself in now?<br /><br />YOU MUST ASSUME 100% THAT &quot;OPERATION ROAD BLOCK&quot; IS CURRENTLY IN FULL EFFECT WITH MILLIONS OF LE DOLLARS BEING SPENT AND MILLIONS OF MAN HOURS ARE BEING USED AS A GLOBAL JOINT EFFORT TO TAKE THIS SITE DOWN AND BUST AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY CAN IN THE PROCESS.&nbsp; WISE THE FUCK UP AND SHUT YOUR TRAP.<br /><br />I hope it&#039;s just a few not-so-bright buyers who want these, and not vendors.

I might wear it riding down town to grab a sandwhich, and i would definitely wear it to a festival. <br /><br />EVEN if an authority figure recognized the guy and camel on the shirt, I wouldn&#039;t have anything on me, nor would i give them personal information.<br /><br /><br />I totally understand the security issue, but ITS A SHIRT WITH A FUCKING CAMEL ON IT. <br />Calm down. Think LOGICALLY<br /><br />Anyone who knows what that is, either is someone who goes here, or a LE who comes here, even if an agent saw you wearing it, what can he do about it?
