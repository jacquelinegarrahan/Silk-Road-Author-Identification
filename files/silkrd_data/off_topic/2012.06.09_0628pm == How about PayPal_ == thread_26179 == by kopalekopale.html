				Or as I call it GayPal... I dont know how many of your nice fellows are familiar with it but it truly is the only safe way to do ANYTHING SHADY! You can easily create a fake account and withdraw your money then ship the goods and the buyer can never loose too... I personally have years of experience with paypal. And while I DO HATE IT it is the only way to do business over the net these days... The billions of paypal transactions are not monitored by any legal entity anywhere. It is safe to say that paypal is much more illegal than anything on silkroad or the armory. So tell me what you think?

				First off, Paypal IS ITS OWN LEGAL ENTITY. They can lock your funds and audit the shit out of you if make any kind of suspicsous transaction. And they do have to answer to the government all the time for shit on a daily basis. Why do you think you have to jump through hoops to get a verified Premier account (involving proof of address, SSN, Bank Account/Credit card, ...etc. Read the T&amp;C before you post about that which you obviously do not know.<br /><br />-1 for being a dumbass and/or troll

				I see no one here has ever used paypal for illegal business. It is understandable to be afraid of something you dont understand. Let me enlighten you... I have years of experience receiving money over paypal for ANYTHING I have posted on sale anywhere (that includes many fake items) And guess what? I never use my real name. Paypal does not care what you do outside of paypal. Thats the point. Paypal is not a legal entity. It is a corporation. Billions of dollars go through it every day for transactions that are marked as something legal but really theres no way to prove anything. I have many accounts using fake names, fake addresses, fake everything... As far as the outside world is concerned I am sending money to a friend OR I am buying a watch for 500 dollars lets say... But in reality I talk with a seller here and we agree on. That way I am protected and the seller is protected because he can withdraw his money and send the goods after that. He can even use my money to buy the goods and send it to me afterwords. I think some people are feeling guilty of their activities and thats why they are afraid. Paypal cares about taxing you and nothing else. Of course you wont put &quot;IM BUYING A GUN&quot; in a title of an invoice... Its a way for money to go from point A to point B it doesnt matter why the money is going from point A to point B no one cares. No one can incriminate you for sending or receiving money. As far as anyone is concerned you are selling pictures, art, whatever... No one can ever connect what dumb comment you made in my post with your paypal account without having full access to your PC... and even then its not certain! Think about it if you have the brain capacity to understand it. If not please stop yourself from further embarrassment and stupid comments in my post... I know its not your fault but still. Have a good day!&nbsp;
