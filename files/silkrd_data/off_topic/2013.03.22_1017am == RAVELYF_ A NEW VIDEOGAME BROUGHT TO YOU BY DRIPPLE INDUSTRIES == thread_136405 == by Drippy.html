				Dripple Industries is proud to present a whole new direction for the RPG genre!<br /><br />&quot;The year is 2017, and after the world economy collapsed due to a new currency called &quot;bitcoin&quot; raves have become the only thing keeping civilization together.&nbsp; As an upcoming hero of the scene, you have been tasked with a grande quest filled w/ fame, fortune, excitement, adventure, underage girls in neon spandex, and, of course, fire-ass pills.&nbsp; Rave your way up the ranks until you reach end-game content where YOU will be in charge of booking and promoting the utmost fire rave parties and achieve top ranks on the global status boards!&quot;<br /><br />Here&#039;s a quick synopsis of the first zone...<br /><br />&quot;A bird flies onto your window sill clutching a small piece of paper in it&#039;s talons.&nbsp; Upon inspection, you find no information but an address.&nbsp; Most would discount it as a carrier pidgeon gone astray, but as a true raver you now realize it&#039;s ON&quot;<br />&quot;You&#039;re all out of rupees from raving so hard last weekend!&nbsp; Pop an adderal to increase speech ability, and find Strict Mother of the Rave Child to ask for $20 to buy a new work shirt&quot;<br />&quot;Find your backpack, but keep in mind it only has 15 slots when packing&quot;<br />&quot;You hop a cab there, but Burly Bouncer who doesn&#039;t like you is guarding the door.&nbsp; Find the back entrance before DJ Mawldawg goes on!&quot;<br />&quot;Back door is being watched by Henchman of the Promoter, pickpocket Mawldawg&#039;s girlfriend who&#039;s puking while coming up on what seems to be Fire Pills for Epic Hologram Guest Pass&quot;<br />&quot;You have entered Secret Rave Dungeon, please proceed to the dance floor&quot;<br />&quot;It&#039;s too crowded in front of the stage where you entered, find Sparkle Bunny to learn Dice Throw Dance ability&quot;<br />&quot;Dice Throw Dance ability acquired, but Enraged 16yr Old who&#039;s clearly eaten Pure Speed Pills will not let you past!&nbsp; Equip Candy Bracers of the Rave God and Glowstick Nunchaku of the Lost Ages to use Swift Lightshow ability!&quot;<br />&quot;Enraged 16yr Old resisted!&nbsp; Candy Bracers of the Rave God can be double-stack upgraded using 2x White Mitsubishis&quot;<br />&quot;Enraged 16yr Old is now entranced, but you&#039;re out of mana!&nbsp; Seek blue pills to replenish.&quot;<br />&quot;Blue Dolphins found, but your gag reflex is high and you know from experience that you have to chew the blue pills for maximum mana - find the water cooler located in the back alley&quot;<br />&quot;::GASP:: the water cooler is surrounded by Zombie Ravers still stumbling around from last night, use decoy shady baggies of bath salts cut 80% w/ flour to lure them away&quot;<br />&quot;One of the Zombie Ravers was really a Professional Rager in disguise!&nbsp; He alerted the others, and you&#039;ve now been cuddle puddled!&quot;<br />&quot;Use Scroll of Nitrous breath to buy yourself 30sec and FLEE&quot;<br /><br />...to be continued (by all of you hopefully)<br /><br />
