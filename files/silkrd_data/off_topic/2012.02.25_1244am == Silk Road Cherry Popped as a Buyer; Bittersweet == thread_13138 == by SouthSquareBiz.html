				It all started on February the 4th. I contacted said vendor about pricing, product, and shipping. I got great communication, the answers I needed and the confidence to put my bitcoin out into the digital world.<br /><br />Ever since I saw my package &quot;processing&quot;, so were my emotions. It&#039;s international, it&#039;s contraband, I have to sign. To make matters worse, it was &quot;processing&quot; for four days. No worries, I was &quot;in&quot; and that&#039;s all that mattered.<br /><br />On that 4th day, I saw that we were finally &quot;in transit&quot;. At this particular point, I was plugging in my DCN twice a day, every day. Looking at postal carriers in my city, in my neighborhood, on my route. I could never be too careful. If I go down, I want to know I did all I could in my power to be &quot;aware&quot;.<br /><br />So, from the 9th to the 13th, my package is sitting in customs not doing a got damn thing. First time shipping or receiving international so I don&#039;t know what to expect. I stay cool...well, as cool as you can when you are trying to run a local business with an international connect. That distance can mean anything can happen......and it did, yet I digress.<br /><br />My package tracking finally tells me it is out of customs. When I say it merely took 2 days for the package to hit NY. I was truly impressed. This was the 15th of February mind you. So, I am thinking it&#039;s coming any day now. My package sits in customs from the 15th to the 23rd. My gut tells me, something like a controlled delivery is not going to happen, but something won&#039;t be right when I get it.<br /><br />11:30 EST I get a knock on my door. It&#039;s the post office. It&#039;s FOUR hours before my post man comes. It is a woman......that I&#039;ve never seen deliver mail to my house. Not nervous, but looking at her in her eyes, her truck, my next door neighbors driveway&#039;s, down my street, in the trees, wherever. <br /><br />I sign. She smiles. I close the door. I watch her walk to her truck. I watch to see if she gets on any electronic device. I watch to see if she is being followed. I listen if any sirens are to come up in the next 5, 10, to 15 minutes. <br /><br />Package looks a bit small, for what I ordered. Standard envelope, like I read from reviews of the vendor by buyers. I inspected the package and on the long side of the package, a nice neat slit had been created on the long side of the envelope that revealed 60% of my order was MISSING. I have a feeling this happened it customs, since it sat so long.<br /><br />I make it a point not to get emotional about this business. You what you are signing up for when you get in! For a split second, I was madder than a motherf*cker, but I look to improve on every situation. The bright side was, I have the ability to facilitate the 40% I DID receive, recoup my principal, and stand to make a little profit. I can&#039;t change the 60% that I didn&#039;t receive but have to make sure that I open communication with the vendor so that it never happens again.<br /><br />I would love for veterans all the way to newbies to weigh in on what you may have think happened between the near East and NY.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, it is going to take much more than a rocky first purchase to keep me away from the road. I don&#039;t know my connect, my customers don&#039;t know my connect, and that is the way it should be. LOL!<br /><br />
