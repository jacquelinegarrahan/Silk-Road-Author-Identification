				And so, the mile stone has finally been reached and I have finally passed into the 5 figure post count. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to thank God, my family, God, the orphans, God, Theo from Dragon&#039;s Den, God and all the people on the forum that wind me up so much and piss me off enough to post about it, God and most importantly the people I love on here.....you know who you are....and I&#039;ll be seeing you later.....bitches. <br /><br />Does anyone have a spare cigarette? I do not have any.....

				Congrats Limetless for clocking up 10000+<br /><br />Here&#039;s what&#039;s fucked up though. I am 100 posts away from being a Hero Member, so on 500 posts I will have the same status on SR as you with 10000. Hardly seems fair to give us both status parity. I think SR should create a new category for the 1000 and 10000+ members. How about.......<br /><br />1000+ = &#039;Legend Member<br />10000+ = &#039;SR God&#039;<br />

I have no like bad feeling about it at all, saying what I said above I think it&#039;s for the best because I am probably too direct with people. Can&#039;t change that because that&#039;s just me, like trying to get night to be day. I just hope I managed to do some good while I had the job, I feel I did so I can leave it thinking I did some good. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for volunteering your time Lim we will have a line in your honour<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s all a brother can ask for Cousins.&nbsp; 8)

I had to play catch up recently because of a back-log so that might have delayed it a bit. Should be next week I would think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am in the same situation, but i am hopeful!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm interesting. Like I said most of the people have got theirs, specifically the Brits and the Yanks but if I remember correctly you two are both from the same country so maybe that country is just being gay. I can&#039;t actually check because I don&#039;t keep the info but thinking back I think I&#039;m right. <br /><br />Just hold tight, they&#039;ll get there. :)

				I can confirm that i recieved my sample; its been a few days since i got it and i have consumed it all.<br /><br />i can vouch for lim when he says that his meph is one of the cleanest that you can get, there was very little jitteryness, lots of euphoria and an amazing energy lift. still burnt my nose like a motherfucker and kept me awake for 40+ hours but it was alot of fun, reminded me of the old days; pre-ban.<br /><br />it did confirm for me though that im not much of a meph man, coke is definitely my adrenaline upper of choice. but Limetless&#039; stuff is still class.
