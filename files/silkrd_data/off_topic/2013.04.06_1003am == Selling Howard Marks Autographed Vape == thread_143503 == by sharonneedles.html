				Oh my mistake - No longer selling publicly here.<br /><br />I organised his recent tour in Ireland! He&#039;s some man. It was the second time meeting him, he comes to Ireland a lot. We smoked the shit out of it in a friends house the morning after the show - we brought a volcano and my vape as well as some homegrown and really nice hash. He didn&#039;t touch the green, he&#039;s only a brown man almost by religion :D Some great conversations were had and then he flaked off to the airport stoned off his tree. History for the Irish cannabis movement was made that day - a lot of momentum moving forward. <br /><br />He lives in Manchester now but is originally from Leeds, is that right?
