				Not from most of you guys, obviously.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />But way too many people are against opiates. They only portray the junkies, not the people using it because doctors are douche bags and are stingy as hell with pain meds because they&#039;re abuseable.... <br /><br />Let me tell you, opiates save me, and SR does too. It&#039;s freakin&#039; cool. Pain can be unbearable sometimes, and doctors like to give you T3? Fuck that! I&#039;ll take something that works, like diamorphine... <br /><br />I don&#039;t use it daily, but when my pain is pretty bad, I definitely will. They&#039;re just super helpful! Doctors are stingy asshats a lot of the time. My friend&#039;s doctor is smart and prescribes her Dilaudid RIGHTFULLY (she&#039;s not lying to get it; she has the pain), but my doctor is loathe to prescribe me codeine for pain way worse than her&#039;s.<br /><br />HAH. Yeah right. I&#039;ll self-medicate.<br /><br />Anyone else here like this? You manage your drugs just like you would if they were prescribed, but you&#039;re not prescribed because of jerkass doctors?

				How can you be addicted to something that you don&#039;t use daily or go into withdrawals for? It&#039;s just like loving Lactaid because it helps you digest milk.<br /><br />Silly goon.<br /><br />@45mypet<br /><br />Agreed. :)

				I&#039;m definitely avoiding opiates because of how addictive they are; I bet I would love &#039;em though. I love weed... I love being really high and relaxed. I was going to get some opium but I hear it&#039;s overrated and fuels opiate addiction. Not disagreeing with OP but... the hate is often warranted.&nbsp; :o

				If you use a substance in the way it should be used (with respect, responsibility and knowing what you are doing/what the substance is and does) there&#039;s nothing (absolutely nothing) wrong on using it. It doesn&#039;t exist anything in nature that has not a function and nothing that should be banned.<br /><br />As I said you in another thread ancient Egyptians used opium (and papaverum somniferum in general) a lot and they surely weren&#039;t addicts nor junkies. They used it for pain, to incite joy in certain circumstances and to have mystic dreams.<br /><br />If just because some people cannot use the substance responsibly themselves you have to ban it (and certain substances can really be lifesavers for certain people - opiates are lifesavers for those having chronic pain, for example) you are just caught in the morality trap, that turns as &quot;bad&quot; a perfectly neutral action to not blame the person committing it.<br /><br />If you use a weapon to kill a person it&#039;s not the fault of the weapon, but of you as an user. Banning the weapon will serve nothing, it will surely not change the individual that committed the crime or the motive why s/he did so and all those users that would employ the weapon responsibly now cannot use it no more. Just like the proverbial: &quot;throwing out the baby with the bath water&quot;.

				The only opiate users I know are very junky like in nature.<br /><br />First they run out of money, then they start doing junky things for money.<br /><br />Now if the person can always afford what they need then they can be functioning in society, but I don&#039;t see that very often.

The vast majority of them are such.<br />But that&#039;s the fault of society as a whole, not of the substance. Frankly speaking, and especially in the western world that should be the so-called &quot;modern one&quot;, the knowledge and behavior of 90% of the people leaves very much to be desired and many things have been corrupted and/or forgotten. However everything in nature is/runs-in a circle (the ancient hermetic magicians called the symbol representing this the &quot;Ouroboros&quot; that&#039;s a serpent in form of a circle eating its own tail) and after a period of rain the Sun will shine up again.

				Ok you and many other people in this country need to stop blaming doctors for this shit. They prescribe them WAY more than you can imagine and the reason many of them are cautious is because the DEA WILL call a doctor that prescribes an amount of opiates each month that they deem to be too much. The same thing goes for psychiatrists with adderall and other stimulants. <br /><br />The DEA is making medicine a difficult practice, not the doctors.

				I know that, flicky. But doctors are FAR too hesitant a lot of the time. I have legitimate, chronic pain, yet I get basically nothing for it. They may get contacted by the DEA, but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ll get into trouble.<br /><br />They&#039;re able to prescribe these drugs for a reason.

				I am so tired of hearing this one. Leave us chronically ill people alone.&nbsp; We know our limits, we know how much to take, and NOT the MD&#039;s! my partner&#039;s one, he can&#039;t prescribe to himself or me DEA would be all over him/her.&nbsp; So, I share my pain meds (only when they in pain of course) with them.&nbsp; What a fucking shame, an MD can&#039;t prescribe to themselves? Imagine 16 yrs of school to become specialized in healing and helping and you can&#039;t help yourself. ???&nbsp; Since they knows what the hell&#039;s wrong with them they don&#039;t need another MD to tell them what&#039;s wrong, just pays a visits fee for nothing to get meds prescribed.&nbsp; However, I am on them for life and yes I take them daily, and I am tolerant and dependent on them. DO NOT CONFUSE TOLERANCE WITH ADDICTION, this is also stated in EVERY pain management agreement you will ever see and sign which I am in.&nbsp; The only other choice I have is to be in pain every day. Recently my MD (not my partner) just out of the blue decided to prescribe me less. BTW, I passed EVERY drug test, I did not improve, and I am on permanent disability when I asked why, the MD stated I think your 60mg dose is too high?&nbsp; There are other medical conditions that cause absorbancy issues which I won&#039;t get into. I am NOT a junkie, I don&#039;t snort, shoot, or plug it. Don&#039;t place opiate users all in one bucket.&nbsp; Remember I am in the circle of physicians, I see what goes on. Yes, MD&#039;s will loose licenses, and get hauled away for over prescribing, and that &quot;pain management&quot; thing, do you think those MD&#039;s are anymore protected, NO.&nbsp; They are resistant to prescribe also. This is the truth! I got so tired of fighting it that I made other sacrifices to be able to afford my supplementation here, and here I am.

				Opiates are wonderful, too wonderful though. I am glad I don&#039;t have any real life connections anymore. I think I might buy some heroin on SR though, having to go through BTC vendors and bank transfers and that fucking shit would probably keep me from doing it too often. Probably.
