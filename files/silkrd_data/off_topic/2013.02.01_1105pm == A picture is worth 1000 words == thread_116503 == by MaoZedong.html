				One thing that really grinds my gears is when I click on a weed vendors reviews and I start reading, and this person has literally written a NOVEL to describe each strain in this vendors sample pack. Like dude, I understand that all weed is different but I don&#039;t need you to describe the exact details of each of your sample strains that you get because when I place my order, it will probably be from a different grower/harvest/strain. <br /><br />That&#039;s why with weed vendors, don&#039;t read into the lengthy reviews too much. Reviews should be based on their packaging and the dankness of their nugs and then the vendors should post a picture of their current strain. I only deal with one weed vendor and I trust that he knows his shit more than any other vendor on the road. <br /><br />Yeah, just have wasted a little too much time reading silly weed reviews sorry&nbsp; ;)<br />

				I like a bit of a description, something besides &quot;will blow your fucking mind&quot; or whatever. I do like weed to do that, but a bit of a description (even a subjective one) I find helpful (sometimes). zB, the times I&#039;ve ordered Sour Diesel strains that were actually Sour Diesel to me had a bit of a sharp taste, like real strong tea (Tannic acid) with a less than pleasant citric acid taste. It&#039;s been a couple of years, but I had a strain the vender called &quot;Maple Leaf Indica&quot; which was very balanced with no bitter taste or sour tinge. Wish I had got some seeds &amp; the soil / fertilizer recipe.

Everyone loves to hear a strong recommendation.
