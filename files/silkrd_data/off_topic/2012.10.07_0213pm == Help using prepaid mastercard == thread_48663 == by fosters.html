				Hi everyone, <br /><br />I have recently purchased a prepaid Mastercard (wasnt from silk road but they are available here) and I&#039;m having some problems using it. The card is in Polish Zloty and I am in the UK. <br /><br />As far as I am aware, I should be able to top this up in any Post Office, and this card should work in cash machines, but when trying to do either of these the card responds as if it is inactive, however when logging it to the online banking website it clearly states the card is active. <br /><br />Does anybody on here have any experience using these cards? Could it be that this card is not available for use in the UK? Is there another stage of activation I have missed? <br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any replies.<br /><br />Fosters

				please dont trust this forum acct<br /><br />they have been spamming the board with offers after specifically being told to stop <br /><br />they are trying to scam community members and i dont recommend you send them any info that could enable them to access to funds - they will likely tell you they will send you btc for it or something<br /><br />if they wanted to offer you real help they would do it freely over the forum not hidden in PM so people cant warn you against what they say

				i know why your posts keep getting deleted its cause you already have posts that say the same exact thing up yet you go and post four more, which when they get removed you go and post another five... even after you were warned to stop. have some respect for the community and stop spamming. <br /><br />there is absolutely no reason for you to constantly beg for an opportunity to rip people off. its dangerous, and not recommend so no one is going to help you. <br /><br />if you are legit you have all the freaking information you need, you were given info on exactly what to do<br /><br />yet you refuse, claiming bs like i wont trust reputable btc vendors with my money pak to give them the code...&nbsp; even when there are reputable btc vendors who during your repeated spamming offered to exchange for btc within 15 min. so you try to get random anonymous people to do the transaction with cause they are so much more trustworthy. more like cause they are more vulnerable to being taken advantage of instead of the other way around

				sorry to hijack your thread fosters, just initially wanted to make sure you were aware of the risk<br /><br />sorry i dont have any specific knowledge of your situation but i would suggest you contact someone affiliated with the card if you can unless you obtained it through some sketchy means or something. they will be able to straighten the situation out the fastest. if you cant use it in the uk then maybe at least they can direct you somewhere online to exchange it. <br /><br /><br />dont finalize early early - you are lying, you have like around ten posts still open that are about exchanging money paks. just bump one of them - its not like all your posts are deleted and you cant get your request out, its just the obvious repeated spam saying the same thing over and over again which is disrespectful. and hero members arent any more trustworthy while being the last ones to fall for something like that. janky even said he would do exchanges in 15 min if you would stop spamming and actually read the forum but you missed it. a whole five hours he was exchanging you spent wasting every ones time
