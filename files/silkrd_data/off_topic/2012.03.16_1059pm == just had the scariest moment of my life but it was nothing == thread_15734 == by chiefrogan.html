				literally as i was opening up some goods that had come in the mail today, DING DONG goes the soul terrifying doorbell. fuck fuuuuuuuuuck fuck shit how how how the fuck, i believe were my initial thoughts. might have had a major panic attack. i quickly and carefully looked through the window and its two dudes in blue jackets and beanies. FUCK its definitely undercover police. fuuuck fuck fuck! <br /><br />ill break here and maybe others might share if they had been in my circumstance.<br /><br />well ended up racing to put my package backtogether so i could at least claim i looked inside and at least a &quot;wtf is this&quot; defense. then i slammed on the button to my computer and threw the usb in a heater vent in the floor. i went back to the window to look a final time before considering bailing out the back to sure to be waiting cops or face the music. however they were no longer at my front door and when i finally got the balls to go out there, i see a flyer taped to the door. turns out they were just random solicitors. hahahahahaha i laughed the biggest relief laugh ever and immediately went for some xanax. <br /><br />&nbsp;it was the biggest spike of instant fear followed by a complete reversal&nbsp; of that feeling. gave my body a loop and i feel a natural high of adrenaline. fuck me i hope that never happens again<br /><br />

				get a no solicitors sign that stop all of them but the god nuts one. also just dont answer the door if you dont know who is at it. the cops will not knock or ring the bell if they had any real proof they just get a search warrant and knock the door down.
