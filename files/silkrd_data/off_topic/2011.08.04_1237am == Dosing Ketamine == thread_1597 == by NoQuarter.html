				Title: <strong>Dosing Ketamine</strong><br />

				Last night I blew half a gram of ketamine over the course of two and a half hours or so.&nbsp; Because I had only done K once before, I started off with what was a low dose according to erowid, 0.03g (30mg).&nbsp; Felt kind of mellowed out after fifteen minutes or so, but nothing more than that.&nbsp; I ended up working my way up to blowing a quarter gram at once, and still surprisingly didn&#039;t feel much more than a slight calming effect and maybe a bit of body euphoria.&nbsp; I trust my source, so I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s real ket.&nbsp; She &quot;borrowed&quot; it from her family farm where they give it to their horses.&nbsp; One thing I neglected to think of was crushing the crystals.&nbsp; I know crushing it into a fine powder would increase surface area, and therefore maybe effectiveness.&nbsp; Is that where I went wrong?&nbsp; How much does one usually take to get into the k-hole?&nbsp; That&#039;s where I got last time, and that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking for.&nbsp; Thanks!

				the first night i got k, i snorted 100mg, and that nearly put me in the hole, <br /><br />i did it the night after and figured i had built up a tolerence so snorted 220mg, that trip was weaker then the first..<br /><br />maybe the first trip is the most intense?<br /><br />try injecting it, that is my next step, although im scared of needles lol

				ketamine tolerance builds super fast.<br /><br />However, .2 should put you close if not into a hole.<br /><br />be careful. :)<br /><br />IM dosages are significantly lower, do your research as well.

				ive actually done tons of research on it, it terrified me for a long time, then after i took e laced with ketamine, i fell in love. that was 3 years ago and ever since ive been wanting to try it, the most popular method of getting to the hole, not to mention the most effective, is through IM injection. only crazy motherfuckers do IV. <br /><br />before i ever inject myself with ket, i would most likely post a thread on the forums to ask for opinions&nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><br />speaking of which, anyone here have any experience with IM injections?
