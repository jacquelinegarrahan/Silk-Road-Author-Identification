				Yay! I found some old oxycodone I lost from a painful dental visit that I lost and regretted losing at the time. I&#039;ve had 7 beers of the course of about 3 hours if I&#039;m being conservative. I just blew a 0.06 (I reccomend everyone buy their own breathalyzer). Should I eat some magic mushrooms, a small dose of 2c-b or take some 325 mg oxycodone? If oxycodone, how many? I have 10 btw.

				What are you looking to get out of your high? If it is euphoric and numb with a sense of well being then the oxycodone sounds good, but watch it since you drank.<br /><br />If you are looking to relax and explore your mind and self and are in a good mood then I would eat the shrooms.

				Well, what I&#039;m in the mood for is MXE, but I don&#039;t have any. Was going to do shrooms with my friend tonight, but he cancelled on me, so I&#039;m all alone. I could just check out and do some oxycodone, which I&#039;m leaning towards because I just found them buried in a junk drawer and I&#039;m very happy about it, I could stay up all night on 2c-b which would be good today since I don&#039;t have work tomorrow and can sleep in or I could do magic mushrooms because, well, they&#039;re magical. Not really sure which I want, so I started this poll to let the people decide.

				I&#039;m also gonna do shrooms next weekend so maybe I should wait so they&#039;ll be more potent? (it&#039;s a problem with me since I&#039;m on an SSRI).

				Yah, man just wait for the shrooms, so it will be more special next weekend than doing it two consecutive weekends. Trust me, I use to grow my own shrooms and have ate a bunch and experimented with the frequency of tripping and the longer apart a trip the better.

				Well I don&#039;t know the mg of oxycodone, you said 325mg but that is the amount of acetiminophen in them, the amount of oxy will be like 5 mg/325 or 10mg / 325.<br /><br />I would do only 10-15 mg of oxycodone and that will give an uplifting buzz. I don&#039;t know how to recomend a dosage safely not knowing you or your tolerance with the fact you have been drinking added to the mix. It is better to go little way an hour and a half then take a little more if desired, than take a bunch at once.

				it says oxycodone APAP 5-325 MG Mallin<br /><br />i have no tolerance. only do opiates when they&#039;re prescribed and i just found this from like, 6 months ago. high tolerance for alcohol, though.

				Then only take two or three of them and wait for 1.5 to 2 hours before deciding to take any more.<br /><br />This is enough for you to feel the effects, but will not be real strong and overpowering, but more of a nice mellow comforting buzz that you can function and enjoy your night on doing whatever it is you decide to do.<br /><br />Don&#039;t keep drinking htough.

				The weed will kick in the buzz from the oxycodone big time. Weed always potentates an opiate high really well in my opinion.<br /><br />I would of recommended more of the pills, but just gave you the lowest dosage for minor effects to be on the safe side, because I would feel bad if I said eat 5 and you got nauseous and too high. Safety first especially when advising dosing on forums to strangers.
