				I know this WAY off topic for SR, but I&#039;ve noticed a few posts relating to Lou Reed and/or the Velvet Underground - must be that SR-people just dig Lou or something, idk - so i figured I&#039;d make a topic, see if anyone wanted to share their Lou reed stories ...<br /><br />For me, I can honestly say that Lou Reed changed my life. He (and his music) saw me through some pretty tough times. All in all&nbsp; &nbsp;Lou taught to me quit caring about waht others (and myself) thought about me; I eventually accepted my [perceived] abnormalities, my anxieties, and my insecurities in a very existential way. so much so I almost began&nbsp; treasuring my faults to point that I pretty made up my identity - because in the end now matter how much like an outcast you feel like, Lou will always there to let you know you&#039;re not alone...<br /><br />a tad sentimental I know, but that&#039;s Lou. Oh, Lou also inspired me to learn the guitar....never seen him live though&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Anybody else got love for Lou and the VU?

				First few VU albums are truly amazing.&nbsp; Other than that I&#039;m not really a big Lou Reed fan.&nbsp; He seems like a real asshole and all I can think about when someone mentions Lou Reed is that he liked to take girls home and have them shit on his chest.&nbsp;
