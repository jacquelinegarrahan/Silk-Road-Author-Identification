				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing i like best about MDMA, is that it shows us the best possible version of ourselves.&nbsp; When I look into the mirror, I don&#039;t just see a guy with giant pupils and sweaty, greasy skin, I see the best person I can be, and I feel as though it has potential to transform so many lives, if only more people would roll....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;...I&#039;m still a true believer, in that I don&#039;t think we would have wars anymore if the world leaders all took MDMA in the presence of the right people, people they would listen to, when the walls fall down, we are all free! Peace, love, and all that good hippy stuff! fuck war!
