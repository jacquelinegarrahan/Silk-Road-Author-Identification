				Been looking for new ways to bring in some capital. Being that this forum is filled with people with the drive for financial gain and the intellect to find/operate on the Road, I figured this was a good place to get some suggestions.<br /><br />What are some of the ways you bring in extra cash? Having a job and selling drugs are already in action, what I&#039;m looking for are little innovative strategies or skills that help you bring in some cash flow. I&#039;ve already dabbled in the stock market and had the misfortune of filling out online surveys (don&#039;t waste your time).&nbsp; Any suggestions are appreciated.

				I sell candy out of the back of my van. The van says free hugs on it. Sometimes I dress up like pedobear and go hang out in kid&#039;s toy stores and sign autographs and charge a dollar.

				I eat nothing but Ramen noodles and poop at gas stations to save on toilet paper. I also ride a bike, shoplift, and pickpocket people. My pickpocket level is only a 60 so I get caught sometimes. I need to level up so I can get some new perks. Then I&#039;ll really save some money.
