				Can I urge all Aussie drug users to take part in the Global Drug Survey, details and link here:&nbsp; http://www.theage.com.au/national/historic-survey-to-shed-light-on-drug-use-20121117-29j53.html<br /><br />The important bit is this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&#039;&#039;Most governments are interested in drug-use patterns among the sickest and most disadvantaged.&nbsp; But that represents a fraction of the people who use drugs,&#039;&#039;.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Policy makers need to understand that drug user -/= junkie and maybe we can go some way to putting an end to the ridiculous, deadly and immoral &#039;War on Drugs&#039;.<br /><br />It takes a while to complete, but it&#039;s important :)<br /><br />p.s. It has a specific section on Silk Road<br /><br /><br />

				Very very true!!<br /><br />Out of everyone I know just about all of them will occasionally use recreational drugs, this includes doctors, psychologists, IT specialists, hairdressers, nurses, electricians... I could go on all day but lets just say the range of professions span a large section of society. All are happy normal well adjusted people who enjoy the occasional substance without causing any detriment to their otherwise regular law abiding tax paying existences.<br /><br />Criminalising a large section of society for making an informed choice about what they put into their own body is indefensible, I am an adult and I know the risks, I do not need a government to legislate on my behalf when it comes to this issue.<br /><br />Locking people up for non violent drug offences is waste of lives and money, oh yes and it also doesn&#039;t change anything apart from destroying the lives of those who are unfortunate enough to get caught in the system.<br /><br />Many years ago during my raving days (late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s) I thought I would see real change is the legislators drug law policy in my lifetime. A entire generation of kids growing up enjoying the ecstasy revolution who knew they were a part of something special, things were really changing and it scared the shit out of governments as it was exposing their bullshit lies and propaganda. Back then we knew we were rebelling against main stream societal norms and we all took drugs on a massive scale and LOVED IT!! Pretty quickly we all started to see through the facade of what had been fed to us over the years, we started to realise that maybe drugs weren&#039;t so bad and we wouldn&#039;t end up smacked out junkies if we took the occasional pill. I also thought and hoped that when this generation where the ones occupying those government positions writing legislation things would change but alas not. We are still hearing the same rhetoric from our governments and Australia is I hate to say getting if anything worse on this issue instead of better. <br /><br />Attitudes to drugs have changed massively over the past two decades and many drugs are now generally considered just as socially acceptable as those legal drugs alcohol and tobacco. Unfortunately our legislation hasn&#039;t kept up with this trend and we still deprive people of their liberty for what is essentially a health issue. Take the drugs out of the hands of criminal gangs by decriminalising them and the entire argument that props up the existing system crumbles instantly.<br /><br />SR is the natural evolution of the free market economy and changing attitudes to drug use, it will eventually scare the shit out of our governments too so we should be prepared to defend it vigorously.
