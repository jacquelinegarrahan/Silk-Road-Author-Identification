				At the early age of 14&nbsp; I experimented with my first drug, Oxycontin. I was selling them 2 other middle schoolers and some girls said it made them horny and I should do them with them so I did lol. <br /><br />After that I quickly tried alcohol and pot. By the time I was 18 I had also tried coke, xtc, xanax, meth, and all kinds of prescription pills.<br /><br />By my early 20s I had tried every single kind of illegal drug aside from Mescaline. And some types of prescription pills. I had also done drugs every way they could be done including IV.<br /><br />During these years I watched my best friend try meth and turn into a tweaker. I got bored of meth and we dont talk anymore since meth is his life. <br /><br />A good friend of mine that was a fire fighter got injured on the job and he was taking a ton of pain pills and he began shooting them up. We were good friends and we were shooting up together alot. He had tons of the green oxy 80s in addition to roxy 30s. But after a while I got bored and now I dont really talk 2 him either. But he is still hooked on them hardcore...<br /><br />While living in a big city I was exposed to crack by a cocaine dealer. For about 2 weeks I went on a crack binge. The binge started with me purchasing a $500 cookie. The guy really hooked me up the cookie fit almost perfectly in a cd case and it was about twice as thick as a cd. It was some really potent crack. By the end of the two weeks I had bought that $500 cookie plus a few hundred dollars more. But once again I ended up getting bored and just stopped doing crack all together to seek out some perfect drug that would satisfy my needs.<br /><br />My roommate was a coke dealer and he had access to high quality coke. During this time I decided to try powder coke. His stuff was so good I was selling it 2 friends at double the price and I was essentially doing as much as a ball a day for free. The coke was super potent and at the time I didn&#039;t realize how good the stuff was. But I got bored of coke within a few days. In fact now adays I wouldn&#039;t do coke for free no matter how good it is.<br /><br />I enjoy xtc and I do that every now and then. XTC still makes me happy but XTC isn&#039;t really a drug I can use on an every day basis so I find myself searching for other drugs to use in conjunction with XTC.<br /><br />I tried shrooms and I enjoy the enlightened thinking and they are cool every once in a while but once again they just aren&#039;t something I want very often even though I enjoy them.<br /><br />Acid is great but I don&#039;t enjoy doing it more than maybe once or twice a month.<br /><br />I enjoy Ketamine but its only fun 1-2 times a month.<br /><br />I really like laughing gas but it doesn&#039;t last long enough.<br /><br />Alcohol is my least favorite drug. Despite being in college you wont catch me drinking.<br /><br />I smoke cigarettes once in a while. If I am taking adderall I will smoke a few or if im on another drug like xtc or acid I will smoke. Alot of my friends are amazed that I can smoke for a few days, usually when im on adderall all day long, and then just stop once I run out of cigarettes. I usually smoke maybe 7-15 days per month but I never smoke everyday. I also dont smoke while I am working or during classes or between breaks for classes.<br /><br />I honestly have to say pot is probably my favorite drug but it is such a pain in the ass to smoke weed and be discrete. I have turned too using edibles instead. <br /><br />But all in all I have come too the conclusion that I use drugs to escape boredom. I remember a psychologist once said that I have a &quot;Constant need for stimulation.&quot; I think drugs are one of the many things I use to satisfy that need for stimulation. I also enjoy things that give me an adrenaline rush and things I know are dangerous. I enjoy sky diving, para-sailing, cave diving, doing stunts on a bicycle, and even fighting gives me some kind of rush. I don&#039;t seek the rush I get from fighting but the feelings and physical reactions my body has from a physical confrontation are somewhat enjoyable too me. I use sex to escape boredom also and since I am young and know tons of girls my age sex is easy to come by but I know it wont be like this forever. Breaking rules like stealing or vandalizing a police car also give me a rush that I enjoy. I enjoy pushing my luck with cops, like if I know where a cop lives I dunno why but it turns me on to steal from him or break his windows. Its really fun as fun as an drug I have ever done and I haven&#039;t been caught. <br /><br />I often think that I am different than most people that use drugs. Because throughout the years I have done every single one of the most addictive drugs their is including shooting heroin, smoking meth, smoking crack, shooting/snorting oxys but I have never desired to do any specific drug too the point that it interfered with my life or my health. I can honestly say I have never been addicted too a specific drug but I do think I am addicted too getting high. But the way I do drugs is weird and its very rare I meet anyone who does drugs the way I do them...meaning they do all kinds of drugs without having a preference or an addiction. I feel bad though because other people have watched the way I do drugs and then they think they can do the same.......which is how more than 1 person I know got addicted.<br /><br />A friend will see me shooting heroin and then she will be like I thought that stuff was addicted but your not using it everyday. Then she tried it and now heroin is her life.<br /><br />Just like when my best friend saw me hanging out with meth cooks and smoking free meth all day but then when the supply started getting low and I was asked to purchase it I went to sleep. My best friend saw how I acted and my actions gave him confidence that meth wasn&#039;t addictive and that he would be able too control his use similar 2 the way I controlled my use.....But too this day he is still on meth hardcore. The last time I did meth was just 2 hits and it was about 4 months ago. Prior to that it had been around 1-2 years. I dont like meth at all these days and like coke I wouldnt do meth if it was free.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even know what to call some1 who does drugs like me. I know I have a problem but other people are heroin addicts, or crackheads, or tweakers, but me....I don&#039;t know what to call some1 who chases all manner of highs as opposed to a specific high. I know I have a problem because I have shot heroin, which I still do maybe 2-3 times a month and I have shot other drugs also......But I can control myself and I don&#039;t become addicted.<br /><br />It would be fun to meet some1 who does drugs in a similar way that I do them and try 2 better understand why I do drugs the way I do and how come I have been able to resist becoming an addict while so many other people I know are addicted to specific substances after just trying them a few times.<br /><br />Post why you do drugs and some of the experiences you had that led to your current drug use pattern.

				i&#039;d try using an e-cig/vaporizer for pot use. like yourself, being discrete is key and as long as i exhale the vapors outside my clothes/hand/face don&#039;t stink up nearly as bad as if i were smoking a bowl/joint/bong/etc.<br /><br />edibles work too, but i prefer smoking as well.

				I have had that same effect of &quot;getting bored&quot; throughout my drug using career.&nbsp; I jumped from one substance to another so frequently that I never had to deal with any serious withdrawal symptoms.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t something I purposely tried to do, for sure.&nbsp; But it was beneficial.&nbsp; So, no, you aren&#039;t alone.

				I do heroin every once ina while now. Its ok but its not like omg this is it this is all I need or anything. I like it and it feels nice to get the warm rush from shooting a good amount of high potency stuff......But I dont like it enough to do even twice a week. In fact I dont think I have ever done heroin 2 days in a row. I usually just save what I have left after the first day so that I dont have a tolerance. I also shoot diliduids, opanas, oxys, roxys, really whatever I want but none of them are so fun that I do them that often. <br /><br />Right now I been stocking up on drugs from Silk Road. I got a box with a few 10 strips of acid, 2 grams of K, like 50 xtc pills, 10-20 xanax, 20-30 valium, maybe a quarter gram of herion, a half OZ of shrooms, some weed edibles, adderalls, a few roxy 30mgs, a few diludids, and I dunno what else I got in there. But my goal is to basicly have a box filled with any kind of drug I want that I can just take out any time and do. But I also wanna have a good bit of each drug. RIght now I have mainly xtc/lsd.

				Why do I use drugs?<br />Escape from my sad reality I guess.&nbsp; Not that I have it any harder than anyone else, I just feel like I&#039;ve lost something essential between my transition from child to adult, and drugs give me that feeling that I&#039;m a kid again.&nbsp; Everything is newer, more exciting, tastier.&nbsp; I wasted probably ten years of my life just sitting there smoking pot though, I used it to escape my shitty marriage - well, used it to escape my dissatisfaction that my wife is a messy pig hoarder.&nbsp; I can&#039;t deal with this mess any other way, when I&#039;m high I don&#039;t care about it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got her down to only two rooms she can really hoard in now, but an awful lot of stuff gets piled onto an awful lot of other stuff.&nbsp; Makes it really hard to find things, be organized in any way, be on time for anything.&nbsp; I once spent 1/2 my day looking for my keys and wallet because I dared to take them out of my pants pocket.&nbsp; These days, I transfer the keys/wallet from dirty pair directly to clean pair.<br /><br />My first drug was LSD, a replacement for a pot purchase I had originally intended to try.<br />It was a blast.&nbsp; Since then I&#039;ve only played with LSD, pot(and any derivatives), opium, dilauded, alcohol, and a tiny bit of coke I found in a baggy by the burger joint down the street.&nbsp; I smoked that in a bowl, figuring if it was heroin it&#039;d not kill me that way. (yes I&#039;ve watched too much Pulp Fiction) It was OK, but underwhelming considering the hype.&nbsp; Funny thing is, if I really wanted to try it I could have gone crazy on it when I lived in central America for awhile... they had coke at the bars, everywhere.&nbsp; I guess watching some naked zombie eat maggots out of a trashcan made me realize the dangers of coke.&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />Your lack of addiction probably has a lot to do with the drug carousel you&#039;re on.<br />You don&#039;t stay on something long enough to get addicted, and you know there are other fun highs out there to try, so you don&#039;t go back again, and again.<br />I am just the opposite, even though I am a lightweight...<br />If I have a bag of weed, I will almost sit down and smoke the whole bag until it&#039;s gone. (At one point I was smoking 1oz of hydro and 1/4Oz of hash per week, gotta love per diem)<br />I&#039;m like that mouse on crack that keeps hitting the lever for more crack.<br />I don&#039;t do many hard drugs, if ever, but I love gorging on pot, scotch, and LSD.&nbsp; Though I find when I&#039;m on L I smoke more than usual, and the effects aren&#039;t very pronounced so I feel it&#039;s a waste of good pot.

				I do it because I just like it. It&#039;s like the topping on the cake. Others like to drink wine and like to be delicate about it, I have that with drugs in a certain way. First is socially acceptable, the latter is a taboo. Not only using it is interesting, I like to read about it too. Through the years I collected a couple of meters of literature on drugs history, the war on drugs, health effects. <br /><br />I had a great childhood and come from a warm family. In highschool I kind of was addicted to pot from 15 till 19 years old, smoking everyday. I was just bored I think. I rather listened to music. Could have done better in highschool because of it but repaired it by working my ass of in college/grad school.&nbsp; Never got depressed about it or something, that&#039;s not in my family. Besides that, it&#039;s just a fuckin plant. <br /><br />MDMA/MDA/MDEA has been in my life since I was 15. Used on and off, sometimes up to 20-30 times a year (especially as a teenager) currently is in my life for a few times a year (festivals, special occasions). These drugs give me some much pleasure. Never a real hangover when used in moderation. Compare it to getting really drunk. I just lose myself with booze and it get&#039;s me really sick the next day. <br /><br />I had a difficult experience a few years back with one of my best friends losing his life because of a drugbinge over a weekend (just a normal guy with a good job, no known mental problems). I did that too now and then when I was 20-28 years. He lost it on a sunday evening after doing, coke, mdma, booze, ghb and ketamine. The ketamine probably got him in a acute manic state and he couldn&#039;t handle it. I stopped using drugs for a year, but got to the conclusion that when my friend would started riding a motorcycle for instance he also probably killed himself too.<br /><br />Came back to the fun I have when going to a festival and doing some mdma and a bit of coke. I&#039;m very cautious with it and don&#039;t lie about it (I hate that) to my girl and loved ones. Never use on working days, only 1-2 a month in the weekends or in vacations when I have time and feel like it&#039;s the moment.<br /><br />Through SR I got some awesome stuff that I put in my &quot;box&quot; for special occasions. Like collecting exclusive wines or whisky&#039;s...&nbsp; :P SR is awesome!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I will be doing this for the rest of my life. I did so many different drugs. Makes me smile when thinking about it, especially because the moments I did it was with good friends on awesome raves etc.. I got in some crazy situations as well that could have gone really wrong.. <br /><br />But, bottomline is that it has a place in my life that I&#039;m currently happy with. Smoking is accepted, eating fat until you are morbid obese, driving motorcycles that can reach 300 km/h, doing rugby, all those things I don&#039;t do because I consider them more dangerous and riskyer compared to my druguse, so why wouldn&#039;t I be allowed to ingest some fine chemicals now and then as a taxpayer and responsible member of society?

				I used to be a heavy drinker.&nbsp; Mostly beer and wine.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t handle hard liquor anymore.<br /><br />Since SR, I&#039;m back to using coke regularly and I&#039;ve stopped drinking completely.&nbsp; Overall I feel better and don&#039;t miss the effects/after-effects of alcohol at all.

				I use drugs because they provide me with fun, pleasure, whatever.<br /><br />-I use ecstasy around once a month. Shit is the most fun I have ever had. And I haven&#039;t even been to a rave yet. I can&#039;t wait.<br />-I drink probably once a week or every other week. It helps me socialize. I&#039;m an introverted person who doesn&#039;t really like other people, so alcohol (and the occasional ecstasy roll) helps me be around others.<br />-I sniff heroin [and shoot up] 2-3 times a month [and once a month, respectively.] One of my old co-workers quit our work several months ago, and it&#039;s something we do now- get together on the weekend, and get high and talk about work, ladyfriends, etc. I don&#039;t *love* heroin though, it&#039;s nice to sniff and kinda fun to shoot, but it&#039;s far from my favorite thing to do. And I get so blasted from shooting, I can barely walk.<br />-I sniff coke pretty rarely: maybe once or twice a year. Really not my thing, but I guess it&#039;s kinda fun if I get together with a bunch of old friends from school and we go driving around high.<br />-I take adderal whenever I get it. Keeps me awake and focused, and makes me feel pretty good.<br />-I smoke weed whenever I get it. Strangely, it&#039;s the most psychologically addictive substance I use, so I don&#039;t pick up too often. I&#039;ll get a bag and sit in my room and just smoke 4-5 times a day, every day, until I use it all. I do love it, though. Listening to music, watching movies, doing...ah...adult things, and of course, eating, are all amazing.<br />-I eat shrooms on occasion, every couple of months or so. Very fun and enlightening.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s about it for things I&#039;ve used more than once. I&#039;m looking forward to trying other substances SR has to ofter.

				I only really fuck with weed on a regular basis.&nbsp; I work in a creative field and nearly everyone around me blazes, so it sort of goes with the territory.&nbsp; I&#039;ve experimented with some opiates and *mostly* dug the experiences, but it&#039;s nothing I&#039;m all that attached to or would want to do with any frequency.&nbsp; Hard liquor is cool, but I don&#039;t have much use for it when I&#039;m holding bud in terms of getting faded (though I do have a soft spot for good beer).&nbsp; Shrooms are the bizness, but I have no interest in doing them with any frequency.&nbsp; Never done X or dropped acid, but I&#039;m down to try either given the right circumstances.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would never ever touch H, white girl or crystal and am not into injecting anything.&nbsp;

				I smoke weed whenever I have it, but I don&#039;t really actively seek it out anymore, but since I have friends who smoke a lot it&#039;s pretty much always available. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done MDMA and couple times and I loved it.&nbsp; Easily my favorite drug, and have been doing it about once a month since I&#039;ve had access to it. <br /><br />Mushrooms are pretty fun too, I usually feel very introspective when I&#039;m on them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done them maybe 2-3 times.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also experimented with some research chemicals such as 2-CE and 4-ACO-DMT, and have enjoyed them as well.&nbsp; I hope to try LSD and DMT soon, but I don&#039;t like to trip on any psychedelia more than once every couple months.&nbsp; <br /><br />I drink most at least 1-2 nights a week mainly because I&#039;m in college and that&#039;s how people I know socialize.&nbsp; Compared to other drugs I don&#039;t find alcohol that great, and probably wouldn&#039;t drink nearly as much if it wasn&#039;t so common. <br /><br />I enjoy opiates but limit myself so I don&#039;t build a tolerance or get addicted.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only done pills though...not sure if I&#039;d try Heroin or not though, if I did I wouldn&#039;t IV it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t IV anything&nbsp; mainly because the vains in my arms aren&#039;t that easy to find, so it would just be too much work, but also because that feels sort of junkie-ish, and I don&#039;t really want people finding out that I&#039;m an IV drug user. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to say why I do drugs at all.&nbsp; I suppose because I enjoy the experience, and they help me relieve boredom.&nbsp; I suppose I&#039;m psychologically addicted to &quot;getting high&quot; in a sense, but I don&#039;t let my drug use prevent me from doing fairly well in school anyway.&nbsp; Part of me thinks that one of the reasons I try in school is so that I can help make sure I can afford to keep using drugs when I&#039;m out of college and most living expenses aren&#039;t being paid for.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to find the balance between living a normal healthy lifestyle, and using drugs at the same time.

				I started smoking weed as a kid.&nbsp; It was fun, plain and simple.&nbsp; Thirty five years later, I use weed to combat my Lupus.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t have it at least three times a week my Lupus flares and I cant function or walk and I get that moon face that goes with it and lots of pain in my joints.&nbsp; If I do have it I&#039;m fine.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even get diagnosed with Lupus until I quit smoking weed for a few years for work (drug tests etc).&nbsp; I tried drinking but that really makes me sick now.<br /><br />When I take the Lupus meds that the doctor prescribes I get nauseous.&nbsp; I smoke week also to combat that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got a vaporizer this week, and ordered some edibles and liquid.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get away from smoking, for health reasons.&nbsp; I hear mouth cancer can get us life long weed smokers.<br /><br />As a teen I tried lsd, mushrooms and coke.&nbsp; Those really screwed me up so I stay far away from them.

				OP, I guess I am similar to yourself though not quite as extreme (no heroin or meth for me) - I was also on the search for THE drug that would make me finally feel truly fucked up, would make me remember why I started the journey - however, almost a year ago exactly I started doing psychedelics fairly regularly. It started with a 5 day long shroom eating fest, went through a couple OZs then I finally got my hands on a steady L connect. Since then I have tripped almost every weekend when I had it (From mid-april till late summer it was difficult to find other than SR). Since then I have found that there is no drug that is going to satiate that need, that want for something more, rather I have become more accepting of who I am as a person and the plans I have for myself and the manner through which I am striving towards bringing those plans to fruition. I too have lost too many friends to meth, coke, and heroin - some I started, others were the one&#039;s who got me into the &#039;scene&#039;. <br /><br />I do them now because they are fun.... with psychedelics being my personal favorite

				I posted once before what my reason for using drugs was somewhere else, but then removed it for reason of image.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lost that interest in image because everyone here uses for one reason or another. My use I consider medical. I would like to say boredom, but it&#039;s chronic depression. Here and there someone tries to say it&#039;s the drugs causing the depression, but I simply pass them by. I know me better than you.<br /><br />I woke up one Summer late to load up for work. I was self employed with a lawn service. I was dead. Dead in the head in the most unusual way. I thought I only needed to rest.&nbsp; I did rest a day. Then I was OK. It came back.<br /><br />6 months later, there I was asking docs what was wrong. I had not &quot;partied&quot; for 4 years prior. Not even a beer. Not even tobacco. I was 28 and being a so called good boy. Something died. I began use of medication. <br /><br />For 20 years I played by the rules for the most part; see a doc, try a Med, end up disappointed in the medical field and the typical treatments for depression.&nbsp; <br /><br />For much of 20 years there were many days spent or wasted away in a state of anhedonia. That&#039;s lack of pleasure. I lost girlfriends because I was no fun. Many a day I managed to get out of bed only to move to another room to stare at a wall. I felt much heavier than I was and wouldn&#039;t socialize. I needed a life and always knew it. I lost jobs and in general was disliked for my silence. I had a secret and hated it. I played by their rules long enough.<br /><br />For a couple years I&#039;ve longed to venture into my own ideas for treating depression. All my life I was a do-it-yourself kind. I studied everything I could think of and had tried everything else legal. <br /><br />Let&#039;s jump to today. My latest and most promising effort is with methoxetamine, the ketamine derivative. It&#039;s a drug who&#039;s mastermind raved over it&#039;s probable antidepressant quality.&nbsp; Some hospitals have introduced a ketamine protocol for emergency depression treatment. With methoxetamine or MXE you take a very small amount every few days and it has a residual effect that carries you through the off use days. It works. Depression comes in flavors, and mine can be melancholic by my own diagnosis. That means depression with agitation. I&#039;m bright and I figure this brightness coupled with an uncooperative brain region results in the flavor of my depression. I want to do so many things yet conflict sets up when so much want to meets too much can&#039;t. Therefore agitation. This is where benzodiazapines come in. Clonazepam is the best for me.<br /><br />Currently I am attacking most of my brain by using a combination of low level drugs. Methoxetamine, tramadol, clonazepam, and zyprexa a kind of benzodiazepine of the thieno variety. As I write this my mind is clear, free of repetitious noise as I call it, and I&#039;m full of desire to do ; to do anything. I write all that I have because my entire brain is now in complete cooperation with itself. I feel hopeful and content, which is to say happy....for now as long as everything keeps working.<br /><br />When you&#039;ve experienced a great deal of real depression and come back to just normal, let me tell you how high that makes me. <br /><br />When you stare death in the face and are pulled back from the edge, sweet tastes sweeter, and the sun shines brighter and feels warmer. My meds as I call them, sometimes make me high. This is cool too.<br /><br />I&#039;m proud of my ideas being carried out under clandestine circumstances. In the end I suggest you go with what works. Don&#039;t believe doctors know everything or are capable of cures. Be an active participant in your endeavors, and never wander somewhere and say fix me. Don&#039;t stand by while different doctors try different, and all too often the same things. If you believe or knew at one point you were genius,&nbsp; then you still are.<br /><br />Become an investigator, a chemist, a courageous physician and heal thyself. <br /><br />My party days are years behind me and I realize my brain chemistry is a tenuous thing that I don&#039;t care to rattle or shock. When Silkroad came along I knew it was time...game on. <br /><br />Why do I do drugs? I want to be a better man.<br /><br />Do you understand the name now?<br /><br />Subdude
