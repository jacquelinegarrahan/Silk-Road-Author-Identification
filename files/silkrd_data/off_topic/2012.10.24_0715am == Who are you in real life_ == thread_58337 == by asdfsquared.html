				I always wonder this about people on the road.<br /><br />Myself? <br />College Upperclassman. Hard science major. early-mid 20&#039;s.<br />Used plenty of drugs in the lower levels of college.<br />All my big hookups from back then have failed out (surprise)<br />But need consistent hookups for harder drugs: SR. <br />Dress across between hipster and skater.<br />Drugs of choice: Opiates (3-4 day binges, then quit b4 wd&#039;s), Blow (at bars, when I have $), occasionally MDxx<br />Drugs of hatred: Weed (hate the feeling)<br /><br />What about you all?

				Well educated, mid 20&#039;s.<br />Have plenty of RL hookups but the prices are insane for everything. (Past five or so years the price of a pill has gone from 1 to 10, weed gone from 160 to 280+ per oz)<br />Dress: Jeans and something with a hood.<br />Music: Rock, Rap, Electronic - No chart, pop or tweener crap<br />Choice: Weed, 24/7. Some psychedelics, LSD twice a year maybe. Shrooms if im in amsterdam. MDMA i only do now when I feel like I have something big about to change in my life, i&#039;e to help me make a decision about something. ( i used to be crazy on this stuff, every friday to monday without fail, earphones in, jaw clenched and ready for raving.)<br />Cant stand: I hate alcohol, cant fucking stand it. Beer, Spirits you name it. Im not a fan of the culture or the people who have deemed it fit to tell me what i can and cant do while they guzzle down their substance of choice, become violent and cause harm to others or themselves be it mentally, physically or verbally. This is tough for me as im originally from the land of Guinness and drunken fools!<br />

				I&#039;m a famous religious leader trying to buy as many drugs as possible to save people from going to hell. <br />Also, I like to take MDMA occasionally because it brings me closer to Jesus.<br /><br />Anyways, I don&#039;t mean to be paranoid or anything but I don&#039;t think sharing details of our private lives is a good choice.

One day I was parked near a school, and I saw a fight break out between few black dudes on a basketball court. It was basically one guy versus two. The two guys pulled out knives, and I thought something really bad was going to happen to the one guy. I was getting ready to call the police, when all of a sudden the one guy&#039;s mom comes running in screaming. She pulls him away by his ear.

I decide to pick everything up and move to the west coast that day and be a cabbie out there.<br /><br />Believe it or not, on the first day of my job on the West Coast, the first person to get into my cab was the same dude whose mom pulled him out of the fight. My mouth was pretty much just hanging open due to the extreme level of coincidence.

One day i was driving my car on the West Coast when i saw a bus with flashing police lights ahead. I assumed a dangerous situation was happening so i jumped out of my car swam across the river to a restaurant and called my football coach to tell him i was safe. While he was glad i was safe, about a year later i was driving my car topless through northbridge at 10am on sunday morning when the same police officer from that original dangerous scene pulled me over and warned me that it was infact too dangerous for me to remain on the west coast.<br /><br />I was promptly moved over to the east coast to a new football club when during a bonding session with the new lads down Chapel St I ran into to the same officer who promptly told me &quot; Welcome to Revolver&quot;

				On a serious note, I&#039;m an activist and revolutionary involved with open source software and hardware, countereconomic agorist left-libertarianism, various anarchist initiatives, animal and teen shelters and hackerspaces.<br /><br />I sell drugs to fund no-kill dog shelters and rescues, open source software projects that desperately need the money, and gay teen shelters.<br /><br />Funny how screwed up this world is that a guy like me has to resort to this?<br /><br />Thankfully, you guys are awesome, and I am glad I thought of this.
