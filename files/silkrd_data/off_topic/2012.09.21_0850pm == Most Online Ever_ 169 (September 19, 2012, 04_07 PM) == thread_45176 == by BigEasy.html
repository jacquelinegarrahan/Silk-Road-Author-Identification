				Much as we&#039;d love it to go on forever, sites like SR do have a limited shelf life. The authorities will eventually catch up with the owners. On a positive note, if SR does disappear, another similar site will spring up in its place. Cat&#039;s well and truly out of the fucking bag now. It&#039;s just too great to order drugs from a rich and varied menu from the comfort of one&#039;s armchair.&nbsp;

				what is the point you are getting at with your title? should it be that the admins must have reset the counter during some sort of maintenance. There have been lots more people logged in than&nbsp; that both during the 4/20 sale, and the big store outage (I don&#039;t remember if it was march 2012 or if it was before that....doens&#039;t matter) both of those days, it was hard to get a post in because you would almost always get a warning about &quot;your IP posted less than 1 second ago&quot; since we are all using the same IP. if you are trying to make the point that SR is growing......it has been for over a year, and it still is :)
