				You could go on virtual dates with other members by running Jitsi* over Tor.<br /><br />Of course, you&#039;ll want to hide your face, but you could get creative with it. Pick a theme and wear costumes/masks.<br /><br /><br /><br />* Or something similar: https://tails.boum.org/todo/VoIP_support/

				I don&#039;t know about that. I&#039;ve known some female drug dealers and sure know a lot of female drug users, so it should be pretty natural some of them might be using SR. Anyway dating on SR? Not my thing unless you would want to go on a date with LE.

What cannot hurt us only makes us stronger. But I do not agree with the, &quot;in your face&quot; attitude many queers express. Straight people don&#039;t get laid as much as us, so its mean to continually remind them that we&#039;re getting our rocks off, and they&#039;re going to go home and drink alone. Not like I don&#039;t bang girls too. Bisexual is probably the best label for me, if I must so be labeled. <br /><br />How goes the love life? Tonight I&#039;m gunna bang a beautiful boy, but I&#039;m sadly out of weed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and why wouldn&#039;t you lol sexuality is pretty fluid. i&#039;ve been with men in the past and i will in the future. nothing wrong with a bit of variety! it&#039;s the spice of life as they say. hah straight guys do have to make the most effort, some get overly bitter about it. then there&#039;s the ones who are obsessed with getting in on a 3 way like they can&#039;t believe 2 girls can have a good time without a cock involved.. <br />got rage against the machines take the power back stuck in my head now thanks arse bandit :D i&#039;m outa weed too i been awake for 32 fucking hours as a result! at least you&#039;re getting laid<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Aside from being able to say, &quot;I have done this&quot;, whats the point of a threeway? I have been in one with two girls, but I can only take so much strapon! Thank god they weren&#039;t as rough as I&#039;m going to be with this boy... ;3<br /><br />

				I this this is a cool idea, but I guess the problem is you&#039;d have to lie about so much. What you look like, where you work, where you live, your personality.<br /><br />... So actually it&#039;d be just like regular internet dating ;)
