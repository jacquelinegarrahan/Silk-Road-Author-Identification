				I am constantly bothered by them and their stupid propaganda. I&#039;ve tried everything, I told them I&#039;m an atheist, I even took their stupid flyer and ripped it in front of them, I&#039;ve told them to get a life. Nothing seems to work, so any ideas should be helpful.

				I thought troll, meant following, like in a thread, but not really contributing, just like stalking. No?<br /><br />Are they really bothering you that much? Like how often/ Once a month? <br /><br />They&#039;re usually nice guys, if you tell them nicely that you&#039;re not interested, sure you&#039;ll take their pamphlet, maybe you&#039;ll read it. That usually satisfies their &#039;mission&#039;, which is to &#039;witness&#039;. To go around<br /><br />and try to get others interested in their church. Is that so horrible? I&#039;ve never understood why many people make fun of them,&nbsp; or act like they&#039;re being harassed or something. I suspect it makes them uncomfortable. <br /><br />Really the most harmless of people that could show up at your door.&nbsp; Why such hatred?<br /><br />I know the guys who visit my neighborhood, and have chatted a few times at the door with them. I guess I&#039;m just more open minded than most. I&#039;ll hear what they have to say. If I have the time. <br /><br />Or I&#039;m &#039;feeling good&#039;, because of an earlier visitor to my door. The mailman! <br /><br />Hey! Just be glad it&#039;s not someone from DHS Borders + Customs! Or some other LE concerning a certain package, yadda yadda yadda...........&quot;come with us please, you have the right to remain silent&quot;<br /><br />After that scenario, two guys that want to chat about their church, seems kind of appealing!<br /><br />Why such vitriol against such gentle people?<br /><br />Meanwhile the only religion that teaches their followers to kill those that don&#039;t believe, treats women horribly, and kills homosexuals because of what they are, you rarely hear criticized. <br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t want to be called an &#039;Islamophobe&#039;! <br /><br />LoL @ Avon - that was a good one!&nbsp;

				They run into me like every other week. I don&#039;t like them because they are brainwashed beyond repair and they try to make other people join their stupid cult. Religion is at the core of most problems of today&#039;s world, no matter if it&#039;s called islam, catholicism, protestantism or some other shit. People are brainwashed and then this brainwashing starts to extend to their family, friends and people that they come in contact with. <br />Being so &quot;gentle&quot; is what makes me hate them so much. They act like that in order to manipulate you. Of course most people like you will say &#039;but look at them, they are so innocent and gentle, I&#039;m sure their religion true religion because they are such good people&quot;. Appearances deceive my friend, their cult is totalitarian, does not allow any sort of dissent, they are alienated from everyone who is not part of their cult. In fact, their only interactions with people outside their cult is them trying to manipulate and convince people into joining.

				I always invite them in. I let them talk and I discuss their views and how my views are wildly different. I try to change their minds while they attempt to sway me. If you have the time, it makes for some interesting conversation. I always enjoy spirited religious debate among the true believers, so I like when they stop by (and I think some of them like talking to me as well). If you get bothered during conversation, just let them know you need a minute to shoot up before you continue in your conversation, and they will probably be ready to leave.

There&#039;s nothing to be mad about. I probably didn&#039;t word my post too well and perhaps came across a little short in my response. Sorry for that as that wasn&#039;t my intention. I don&#039;t have any emoticons to add to my posts at the moment. It&#039;s been that way for my last 6-8 posts now. Might log out and then log back in and see what happens.<br />Raz, you have been a little picky lately with certain things. I noticed you had a dig at a spelling mistake I made with &quot;per se&quot; instead of it being &quot;per say&quot;. You have to factor in a level of tolerance for people such as myself who may have over indulged insome potent gear. I would like to point out a boo boo which you continue to make just to even the score at 1all. When you sign out at the end of your posts, you write Piece out, drive safely and eat plenty. The piece should be peace as piece is used for a piece of paper.<br />Raz, from my point of view, there is no issue with anything, nor has there ever been. My opinion of you is the same it has always been so I hope you feel that way too. We might of got our wires crossed at some stage but I hope things get back to the way they were. Truthfully, how did all this bullshit begin anyway? Fucked if I know anything anymore, time for a little shut eye. Till next time........ <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wado :) couldn&#039;t answer that as I was flirting with word limit. Lol, again as per last night, I tease and crack a lot I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve noticed! Picky? Who, me? Lol, just having a crack here, nothing too serious. I&#039;m aware some of you are french-kissing bongs right now and farting cocaine according to ONE odd post I saw yesterday :o , still, I got all the tolerance for you guys but I can&#039;t resist slapping you forum members on the ass and then running around the corner to hide like a juvenile fuck. That&#039;s just Raz being Raz as opposed to being genuinely upset over the fact you wrote yogurt instead of yoghurt ....... (YOU FUCK!! Spell-check should have picked that ^&nbsp; :o :o :o ) ....... getting back, I have only had my period on the forums once, and that was the other day when I hadn&#039;t slept and a couple of other things I need not expound here. Besides, I&#039;m back on the pill. I&#039;m fine from here on out. :)<br /><br />Um. What the phuc Wad. Ooohh...... did you just say Raz spelt something wrong? ??? [Edit. Sorry, I just got it. Phuc, Wad... fuck-wad lol, sorry I just got it&nbsp; :D ] Back on track, hang on what do you mean by peace not piece.... Usually it is spelled &quot;peace&quot; granted, but there was this odd quote I came across once that said in part, &quot;Oooohhhhh, that&#039;s a B-I-G organ....... ay, Carl? Ba ha ha....... Look, peace man.... a piece here.... a piece there.... Ba ha ha.....&quot; It&#039;s taken from that. I wrote it incorrectly the first time I was on BMR and I let it stick because of the quote, besides, it&#039;s charming I presume. ;) Or maybe not, I don&#039;t really care, it&#039;s just one of the many individual writing mannerisms I have. Everybody is the same, we have a propensity to make mistakes..... I just do it on purpose, it lends a little individuality.<br /><br />pmsl.... piece as in piece of paper.....Good phucking grief.... (See, you there you go, another &quot;mistake&quot; I make with phuc instead of fuck.....again at BMR, when I started I didn&#039;t want to say fuck b/c I thought I&#039;d be booted...... yeah, that&#039;s what they used to do in some chat-rooms..... it was sTuPdGrL if I remember, which I do, that had that quirk. Anyway.... Piece out, Wado! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol..... O0 . So basically it&#039;s from that.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				So, true story my mom still loves to tell to this day. I was 13, it was soul saving season in Southern California and the missionaries were a knocking. First the Jehova Witnesses and then the next day the Mormons. Told them both I really needed to find god but didn&#039;t have time right at the moment for them and asked each to return the same time on Saturday. I spent the next forty minutes attempting to convert all four of them (they travel in pairs) to Zoroastrianism... I think my house ended up on some sort of list after that... they never came back.
