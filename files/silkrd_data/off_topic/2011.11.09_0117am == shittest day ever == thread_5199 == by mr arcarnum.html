				worst day ever happened yesterday, fucking girlfriends guinea pig died in my arms, I know it sounds pathetic but the critter was so goddamn cute and amazing, just coming up to his 3rd birthday, he hadnt eaten all day and seemed a bit grumpy and had a croaky squeak but he&#039;d had it before and been absolutely fine, decided to give him a bath and dried him with the hair dryer as usual, left him a couple of hours in his cage in the dark, I picked him up gently and he fitted and stopped breathing, ran to the vets as fast as I could but he was gone, fucking bawwed my eyes out in the vets, was my girlfriends first day of her new job too, took two cuttings of his hair for her cos he had a awesome blonde streak for no reason and he was grey the rest. dont know why im posting this on here to be honest but it just sucked so bad to have him die in my arms.<br /><br />R.I.P little buddy :(

				Awww, I&#039;m so sorry sweetheart. ):<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had luck with guinea pigs. I got 1 from a friend of my mothers several years ago, and it died within a month from unknown causes. Then, probably a year or more later, I got 2 beautiful calico guinea pigs, a mother and her baby. They lived about 5 months before the mother died, again, I have no idea why, and shortly after the baby died. I was devastated, because they were fine the day before, then I wake up to find them stiff in their bedding.<br /><br />I hope things look up for you, it&#039;s always horrible to lose a pet.<br /><br /><br />&lt;3

				Once my friend had a guinea pig and it got loose and they didn&#039;t realize.. He was hiding in the gears of this exercise bike.. so when he went to exercise on it the guinea pig exploded. <br />(moral of the story is that the death could of been much more fucked :P haha)

				Sorry to hear that guy.<br />It always sucks to have death in your life.<br />I was walking my kids home from school a couple weeks back, they&#039;re 5 and 2 years old, and some guys decided to use my side-street as a way to get ahead of traffic on the main (this never works, no one will let you in when you try to cut in this city) instead they ran over my blind neighbors cat.<br /><br />They crushed part of its head and it was flipping out like crazy.<br />I yelled at the fuckers to slow the fuck down in a residential area, but I don&#039;t think they speak English.<br />Anyhow, I shielded as much as I could from the kids, so they are OK, but I really feel for the blind guy.&nbsp; He lives alone, and I haven&#039;t seen much of him since.&nbsp; I do see smoke coming from his chimney, so I&#039;m sure he&#039;s still alive, but I think it would be so lonely being blind at his age.&nbsp; He needs a hug, big time.<br /><br />Pet store animals are often inbred so badly, they don&#039;t last too long.&nbsp; I probably wouldn&#039;t buy another one of those suckers, they also have very short lifespans, even without inbreeding.<br />Bury him in peace, and give your girl a hug.&nbsp; Don&#039;t apologize or she may wind up thinking you killed it.

				Sorry about that man.&nbsp; Animals have this way of being so lovable and then have these damn short life spans.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a cruel joke.&nbsp; &nbsp; I had a cat seize and die in my arms once while the vet left the exam room to get &quot;the drug&quot;.&nbsp; She went on her own terms but it really sucked.<br /><br />Give it some time and you&#039;ll find room for another critter of some type in your life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel for ya.&nbsp; <br /><br />BigFlake
