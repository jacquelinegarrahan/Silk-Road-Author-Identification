				Well, I&#039;ve never done anything except raves/after hours clubs/parties on it, I kind of feel like there&#039;d be no point otherwise. I dunno.

				Outside of the party/club/rave scene MDMA is a really awesome social drug. It&#039;s excellent to do with a few close friends, or even complete strangers. MDMA is an empathogen so you&#039;ll have super deep conversations and lots of touchy feely bonding moments.

				I think I can honestly say I prefer using MDMA with a few of my closest friends all laid up in a bed with our favorite music playing, a few trippy lights and a few drinks. The connection you have with people is amazing, especially when you have the opposite sex involved, this is a must ;)<br />But then using MDMA out raving in he right setting is still mind blowing amazing.

I did that for the first time recently after years of heavy use and drinking as much as i could when high. It was so lovely, really clean, i got no come down. Felt great the next day and could even sleep at some point in the night/early morning. I do find though i crave alcohol when on MDMA, i can drink so much its ridiculous!<br />

				I prefer to roll hard...obviously ;P<br /><br />Seriously though, I like to roll safely.&nbsp; <br />Pre and Post Load and keep it to every 1-3 months to keep the magic going.<br />My serotonin receptors have taken such a beating in my life time, that I&#039;ll do everything I can to keep them from burning out again.<br /><br />Good friends, trippy lights, shag carpets, vicks, massages, etc.&nbsp; All the typical things that make rolling fun.<br />It&#039;s definitely best in the right environment with everyone rolling at the same time for sure though.<br />Concerts, festivals, house parties, outdoors, in the pool, anywhere that is comfortable and entertaining.<br />I vastly prefer MDA over MDMA for Concerts/Light Shows/Festivals though.<br /><br />Guess it just really comes down to personal preference.<br />Whatever you enjoy doing, you&#039;ll enjoy it that much more rolling.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Vanquish

				When I was younger, I had a couple of pills of some of the last legal pharmaceutical MDMA, um ever. It was less speedy than the stuff that you can buy now. The trip was enlightening, relaxing even.<br /><br />Perhaps someone has some that they could recommend. I usually candy flip but I wouldn&#039;t mind a nice relaxing evening with some friends.

				I prefer to roll at concerts/music festivals but lately Ive just been rolling with friends at house parties or when were all going out to a club.<br /><br />Smoked a small hit of DMT in the center of the crowd at a music festival this summer while rolling &amp; on 2C-I, that was pretty fucked up. Not doing that again lol

				I&#039;m a loser with no friends, much less friends or even acquaintances who don&#039;t think that all drug users (except alcohol) should be given harsh prison sentences.<br /><br />So I usually wear headphones and play with various light sticks, disco balls, and other toys.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been to a club or bar and don&#039;t intend to try, but I did hit up Ozora, my first festival, this year and I could see doing more of those, but just maybe.

Did it have much of smell? <br />Very jealous you got to try it when it was legal. Bet the quality was consistently excellent back then :-)
