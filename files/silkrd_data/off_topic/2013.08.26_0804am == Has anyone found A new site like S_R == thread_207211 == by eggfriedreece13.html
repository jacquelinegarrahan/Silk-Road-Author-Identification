				I used to vend on Atlantis before moving here so I guess you can call that tried and tested.<br />[CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion<br /><br />From a customers point of view I find the site better and buy from there but as a vendor I prefer the fact there is more traffic here, Just more scams on vendors too :(

				For the type of market SR is and being the most popular it seems to be the best there is. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be swayed from SR.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ever.<br /><br /><br />:)<br /><br />- IW

				You should hit The Evil Wiki: http://wvk32thojln4gpp4.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br />or maybe a Tor Search Engine like Torch: http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion<br /><br />Lots and Lots of Scamming and Phishing going on. Be careful who you trust.

				No shit Kiwikiikii. SR is more than a market place. It is a business that the owners of it profit off of. If I were in their shoes I would be blocking competiting sites also. It doesn&#039;t matter though. 95% of the business is here anyways.<br /><br />

				Well, I just noticed that the very first link on The Evil Wiki... the link to Silk Road&#039;s &quot;Protected&quot; Site... is a phishing address. I no longer trust any of that site&#039;s content and I suggest you do the same. Although there&#039;s good stuff among them, ALL link and content sites are full of scams and phishing sites.<br /><br />Be careful. Be suspicious. Be wary.
