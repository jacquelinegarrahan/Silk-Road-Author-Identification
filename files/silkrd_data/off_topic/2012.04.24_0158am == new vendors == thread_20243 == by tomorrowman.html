				I know a lot of new vendors &#039;donate&#039; to get their names known but i didn&#039;t. I think a lot of it is your ability to let people know you are there and that you are a professional at what you do... focus on &#039;fast ship times&#039;, &#039;excellent packaging&#039; and just plain old &#039;good customer service&#039;.<br />I will be the first to admit my pricing is not the best but where I excel is in the areas mentioned above. When someone orders from me (when I have stock! thanks 420 sale!!) they KNOW it will ship that day or the next day AT THE LATEST. That I will msg them if something happens or just msg them to thank them for their order (not as much now, too busy!)<br />I am sure there are plenty of &#039;professional&#039; buyers on here who will tell you that price is not the only factor.<br /><br />Good Luck!!<br />TJ

				Answer questions. Don&#039;t require FE. Be nice. Be professional. Offer cheap product to start, no ones going to buy a 250$ Oz off you when you have low feedback. But, a 15$ g would be doable. (Or 1 pill vs 100/.25g vs 3.5g) etc. Advertise yourself in the products offered forum. Take advice, and don&#039;t be a dick about it. If you get reviews saying your packaging sucks, fix it. <br /><br />Slow and steady my man, slow and steady. <br /><br />ALSO, if needed, ask those who you ship to to make sure they leave an honest review in the forums and in the feedback. =]

				If you can offer something unique that others can&#039;t, you&#039;ll get noticed, IMO. The users of the SL aren&#039;t one-off drug addicts, but rather responsible, mature dabblers. Offer a price and a product that can&#039;t be beat and you&#039;ll get some loyal customers in no time. It&#039;s basically monopolistic competition. Distinguish and differentiate yourself and you&#039;ll be somewhat of a price-maker. Sell a homogenous product and you&#039;ll be a price-taker.<br /><br />Source: microeconomics.

				Start with professional packaging, professional service. Wouldn&#039;t hurt to be active on the forums and advertise there as well. Giving discounted small amounts or samples certainly speeds up the process but it isn&#039;t necessary.<br /><br />If you got good product and service from the start you&#039;ll go a long way on the Road.

				i&#039;ve heard that coke isn&#039;t really addictive, just psychologically so. is this true? if so, I might try it. If not, I&#039;ma stay away from it. And I include chemically-induced cravings as being chemically addictive.
