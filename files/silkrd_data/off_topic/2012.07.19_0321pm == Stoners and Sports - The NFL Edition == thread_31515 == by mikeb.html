				hey guys. i figure i&#039;d start some sports banter if that&#039;s ok with you all. weed and/or football are usually the 2 things i have in common with most of the people in my circle. let&#039;s talk about the upcoming season. what team do you roll with and how do you think they will do this year? maybe we can even ask some of the cool vendors to give us some football specials also :) i get down with the Falcons all day! i think the squad will do decent this year. i say 10-6. just too much of the unknown going on right now. new OC and DC, new players, and on top of that, each game is home one week and away the next for the entire season. can&#039;t really build any momentum when you have to travel every other week, IMO...

				Eh, I think we need a new coach, hes been long overdue for a replacement ::). But I guess you&#039;re right, the team seems to be a hit or miss every year, can&#039;t say my MLB team is doing much better though &gt;.&lt;

				FMP...if McFadden can stay healthy, i think the Raiders can win the conference...that&#039;s a big ass IF though...<br /><br />krypto...i was thinking we could all make some friendly &#039;wagers&#039; on here. something like the loser can pay the winner in btc to get them a nice gram of whatever...

				cool shit bros. we will revisit the closer it gets to the season. maybe we can make it simple and have everyone pick a winner from each game for each week and whomever picks the most winners for the week will get the pot...maybe a tiebreaker or two...but nothing too elaborate...

				I love sports but not into American sports. Never been but plan to go some baseball or Football USA style. Watching it on the TV is not the same. You got to be there. In the UK this usually means threatening opposing supporters and singing songs to the police.<br /><br />I&#039;d like an SR pool so that might make me watch some American NFL<br /><br />What drugs would be best for this?<br /><br />I like a beer and smoke with the lads before football. <br /><br />Watching on TV, cannabis beer, maybe coke if its a big game and you may win the pool!!<br /><br />I think the Miami Dolphins will win this shit.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />

I am a Bears fan and I swear I felt near cardiac arrest last season. Sooo rough with all the injuries and 3rd string qbs that looked like they were playing with some sort of palsy.<br /><br />My favorite football tradition is to eat shrooms when the Ravens play the Steelers. I don&#039;t have much preference for either team but the rivalry is always particularly intense especially while the TV screen is melting :D <br /><br />And count me in on the pool&nbsp; 8)

				love that name, weedsaves&nbsp; :D but you prefer benzos?!?!?! you just like em both then...nothing wrong with that!!!<br /><br />well at least your boys got Forte squared away and an above average receiver in Marshall. those linebackers are getting a little old, but i still think they will be solid. sucks to have to play GB and Detroit twice though...

				Weed is my lifelong buddy that will never let me down. Benzos are for emergencies and rough trips, which is pretty much what the second half of our season was&nbsp; :&#039;( I wouldn&#039;t actually use up my benzo tolerance for football games tho. That would take away from the action. I watch sports for the intensity. Which is why I love psychedelics + sports&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Forte and Marshall are good weapons but they are useless if the O-line continues to miss blocks. And yeah Detroit and GB are tough, but such great rivalries...so intense!!!&nbsp; :)<br />

				i know all about horrible O-lines bro. Cutler has taken a real pounding over the years, so hopefully this year will be different...but man, your boys have to face Megatron AND Rodgers more than everyone else. i feel as long as you got Urlacher, old or not, you always have a chance on defense...
