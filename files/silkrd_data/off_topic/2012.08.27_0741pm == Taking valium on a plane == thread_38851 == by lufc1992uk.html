				I am going to Florida from the UK soon and want to take some valiums on my carry on luggage, would I be able to just stick them in a bottle of aspirin or paracetamol pack? They are unmarked/blank blue valium pills from the vendor Black Tuna Gang.<br /><br />cheers.

				I&#039;ve taken a number of legal and illegal pills through airport security and never had an issue. As long as there&#039;s no plasticy-explosive stuff (which valium shouldn&#039;t have anyway) you should be fine with putting it in with aspirin, skittles, or, if you are so inclined, up your ass (though I wouldn&#039;t recommend this route since they might pick it up on those body scanner things.)

				They won&#039;t notice or care.&nbsp; The only thing you would have a problem with would be bringing along more than a single person would require.&nbsp; Then they might think you are distributing.&nbsp; Leave that part to SR.

				TSA has let a lot of shit go in my experience, but I guess that&#039;s dependent on who&#039;s working, which airport, etc. Got caught with a gram of bud in my bag one time (legitimately forgot I had it in there), and I was called over and the man just said &quot;Keep this hidden better next time&quot;, gave me my bag, and let me go to my gate :). But this is obv not the usual scenario. Put it in a regular pill bottle, I&#039;ve always brought ibuprofen on planes because of my headaches, never questioned about it once.

				Put them in your case... not in hand luggage, if it&#039;s in you hand luggage, put them with some painkillers and if questioned, you&#039;ve a fear of flying (For anxiety) - My other half does it all the time... Your stressing over a real minor thing, (Just one or two in handluggage is fine)<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken acid in my hand luggage.... Don&#039;t worry, the thing to remember is why do you need say &gt;10 pills for a plane journey. (We&#039;ve never been prescribed them and we fly +10 times a year (I travel for business)&nbsp;

				The TSA doesn&#039;t care if you have a personal amount of pills in your bag. They are not going to check everyone&#039;s pill cases and make sure they have a prescription for them, that would take too long and it is not their job. I have carried countless number of different drugs on a plane in small quantities and never been even suspected of anything. Unless you are bringing 100+ pills don&#039;t worry, just keep it in your carry-on bag.
