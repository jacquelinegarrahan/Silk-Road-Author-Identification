				I&#039;m not quite sure where I fit the model just yet as I&#039;m only getting started and &quot;friendsource&quot; bud. <br />No real contacts but I guess I&#039;m independent at the same time since I&#039;m only liable for my own operation.

				It has been a while since i saw it, but as far as i remember it is quite informative.<br /><br />If you like documentaries and such, about drugs you should check out this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172947.0<br /><br />

				Very informative indeed! Also quite entertaining! Especially the import smugglerguy thathat snuck the coke thru customs in a ciggie box. Man..it must be nice being a step ahead of LE! I&#039;m not trying to be that big tho. The most interesting part is how these dealers all had a problem getting high on their own supply. That shits sooooooooo true! I tried it, and for the most part, it left me too paranoid to conduct big business (or any business at times lol). Kudos to you if you can! Ps...weed doesn&#039;t count...

Maybe it&#039;s a side affect of addiction but I always plan to live an understated life and if I ever do go bigger an make money put it into a real business and get out in&nbsp; good time.<br /><br />It seems to be the downfall of every dealer on that documentary and I guess it must be the ego/honest side of drugs like coke/mdma that you cant help telling someone something you later regret<br /><br />That said&nbsp; I do smoke weed but cant enjoy it like I used to as it makes me more paranoid thinking &quot;What if I made a mistake, DNA, fingerprints...Maybe the government has all our dna in secret&quot;&nbsp; <br />Been trying the new rule of shutting off SR work related stuff when smoking and assuming I&#039;m just being paranoid and it helps.

				nice documentary<br />i always thought that you could always keep a part of the drugs for yourself if you&#039;re dealing with large quantities and eventually you&#039;ll probably get bored of it<br />i think that would happen with weed, i don&#039;t know with coke though, never tried it
