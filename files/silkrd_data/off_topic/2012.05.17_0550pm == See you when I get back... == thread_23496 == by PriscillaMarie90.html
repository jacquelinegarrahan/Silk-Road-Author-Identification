				Thought of you again today Pris and how the government&#039;s War on Drugs has once again brought down a harmless person in a chance situation. There was so much I wanted to talk to you about before you left but once again chance dealt a hand that did not allow us to communicate. <br />You are a very special person that has so much to contribute without a hint of spite in your motives.<br /><br />Stay strong and dont let you government mandated torture break you. You&#039;ve done nothing wrong only a victim of the governments histrionics and ancient mindset to impress other unimpressives. <br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath

				Dang, I am just returning to this post to read all your replies, thank you all so much for your support :D<br /><br />I got 2 felonies, possession and possession with intent to distribute(which i was actually innocent of intent to distribute, but my word against theirs i guess)<br /><br />Was sentenced to 10 days in jail followed by 28 days inpatient drug rehab + 2 years probation<br /><br />Did a 2 for 1 thing(is what they kept calling it...) and only had to do 5 days in jail but wow it was the WORST 5 days of my entire life, hands down.. :&#039;( But that part is over and the rest will be a breeze, not to mention I am walking on sunshine cause it&#039;s a deferred sentence so it wont go on my record.<br /><br />I never carry drugs on me anymore lol so at least I learned that much, I guess. You guys don&#039;t know the feeling of reading all your responses on here and all the support I love this community so much, a thousand times thank you all!! &lt;3
