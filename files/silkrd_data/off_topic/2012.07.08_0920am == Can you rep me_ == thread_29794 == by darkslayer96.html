How to give reputation has been repeated so fucking much that you should be able to figure it out by a quick search, but apparently you&#039;re too lazy. ::) Also, having atrocious grammar pisses me off and is an easy way to receive more negative karma....just saying. It doesn&#039;t take a genius to learn the basics here, it took me an afternoon after all and I&#039;m a fool.
