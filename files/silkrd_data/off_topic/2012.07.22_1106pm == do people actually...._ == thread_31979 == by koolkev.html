				yeah right, i totally agree! everything is fine here, except for weed. decent hash is really hard to find on the streets and i&#039;m glad to shove another 20 bucks up dutchshop&#039;s ass for his zero zero, but c&#039;mon vendor guys, lower the weed prices...

				I like sellers such as Puffbuddy who have good deals for good bud for smaller sizes like a quarter. You cant complain about 60-80 dollar quarters for a pretty good bud.<br /><br />And then theres bud from sellers like Lexiesadie that gets you blasted after a couple hits. Its honestly worth the money.<br /><br />Other sellers have bud that is very pretty and what not but either its really expensive or its lacking the potency.

				I only buy bubble hash and oil.<br /><br />The bubble hash is way cheaper than I can make because I don&#039;t grow my own plants.<br />The honey oil is almost the same price as if I made it. But that $20 discount, not having to make it yourself and leaving it to professionals with high-end strains is worth the risk.<br /><br />But weed, never. The medicinal herbs from Colorado and California are already flooding the streets across the nation and are way cheaper than on the Road. <br />

				Where I live, mids cost $40/gram, where good stuff costs $70+, so SR is a godsend for me. We don&#039;t have access to shrooms, LSD, hash, cocaine, meth, heroin, DMT, MDMA, ketamine, or anything else really, so buying from SR can almost always guarantee being able to resell it at several times the SR price. People buy shrooms at over $1000 an ounce where I live; apparently nobody is willing to grow them. Good weed on SR costs less than our shitty, old shake that&#039;s been stored in a non-sealed container for months&nbsp; ::)

Meth is also ridiculously priced. As you mention, so is blow. Most pharms and opiates are through the roof. But you&#039;re paying for the convenience. Most don&#039;t want to have to social network on the streets to find good deals.&nbsp;

				Im surprised alot of people dont order weed off here. For where I live its considered one of the cheaper drugs listed. Its more like opiates and coke that are ridiculously priced imo. <br /><br />The best priced product on here thats domestic has got to be mushrooms.

				many weed prices are so high because i suspect many vendors just resell what they buy from dispensaries. the prices at most dispensaries are still pretty high. <br />We grow and make everything we sell on the road ourselves which is why my wax prices beat dispensaries prices.

				On SR you&#039;re not just buying the drug. You are buying the packaging (to get the product to you undetected), which for weed, as pungent as it smells and the mass it has, must be somewhat intensive.<br /><br />I know I have gotten orders of stuff not nearly as smelly as weed, in powder form, that the packaging looked to have taken significant time and cost to prepare, as compared to sending a regular envelope through the mail. As well as compensating the person supplying you here with for the time they take to pack and ship your goods. <br /><br />You ain&#039;t just buying drugs, you&#039;re buying a drug supply service. If you want them cheaper, go get into your car and go get them.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor, but I don&#039;t think most of the folks who bitch about prices have put a lot of thought into all the hassle and time it takes to be one. <br /><br />All I&#039;m attempting to do is show why I don&#039;t think most drugs are that expensive on here. There is more than meets the eye.

				I have one friend who buys hash locally.<br /><br />I have another who orders weed on SR. And hash. The weed he gets is fairly comparable to the hash my other friend gets, and when my first friend gets weed it&#039;s relatively just sad.

				Have yet to buy anything on SR as I&#039;m new and just getting familiar with all this but east coast prices on ganj is average... zones are 350-375, qps are ~1300.. but I&#039;m trying to find someone with legit medicinal herbs (I am diagnosed with a disease) with a secure caregiver. But from what I&#039;m reading this shit is legit, honestly I&#039;d say good prices on a lb would be $2000-2500.. I&#039;m thinking Cali prices but haven&#039;t thought of the packaging price, just a new member advice haha

				I do, and here&#039;s why. <br /><br />I have a local dealer that I can get good quality weed from for $20/g and $60/eighth. I&#039;ve gotten Chem Dawg, Banna goo, Blue Dream, Alaskan Thunderfuck, and a couple other popular strains from him before. Problem is that I never know what he&#039;ll have, and he runs out sometimes. Here I can get the same prices, but I know exactly what I&#039;m getting and where its coming from. If I want I can even buy stuff straight from whoever grew it. Its just awesome to be able to have this kind of choice. <br /><br />Another reason - all the people around here that sell commercial weed are sketchy as fuck and hard to find. If I want to make a batch of brownies or something I&#039;d rather buy some schwag off of here than deal with having to hunt them down and potentially get shot.

				i dont smoke anymore,but i wish i found SR when i did. where i live anything that isnt mids is 20 dollars a gram, and that can mean anything from seedless mids to killer chron. so you never know what youre going to get. the weed on here is about the same price, consistent quality, grown by professional growers, is the actual strain it says, and you can buy organic weed. so in my opinion SR is better than the average dealer because you know what youre getting.

				I do sometimes.One reason is they have a huge selection of different strains,keifs,hash,oils,waxes,budders,and edibles.Plus you can find weed for decent prices here on SR I just picked up 4 grams for $25 including SR fees and priority shipping.You just have to look around awhile not all vendors sell there 8ths for like $70.

				Wow, I have been thinking the same thing. I have bought my bud soley from the road for over a year now, and at the begining it was amazing. GREAT bud, some of the best I have ever had, at prices my local dealers could not match for the quality. 80 quarters, 150 halfs, and 280 ounces. Now I am getting to the point I am going to refuse to buy any bud on SR. Why pay for overpriced, leafy, mediocre bud? It makes me so mad to see all these price gouging pricks (yeah, I know someone is going to say &quot;if you can source it sell it for what you want&quot;, whatever) and people are STILL buying the shit?<br /><br />Don&#039;t even let me get started on the acid market now.....I am consistantly seeing a decline in ALL product quality and an increase in product price. If we don&#039;t get more new blood who are willing to try to change the market (trust me, lower some of your prices and I am sure you will get 10x the orders. That&#039;s just how it works) instead of being greedy I don&#039;t see much hope.

				I ahve nice medicinal quality weed, not the best of the best but really strong and good. I sell locally for $3000 - $3200 a pound. Shipping little batches seems like too much of a hassle, but I would love some regulars who want maybe a half pound sent.I can pack the shit out of it but it takes time for sure.&nbsp; I am just worried about how to send it without getting my face all over cameras and shit.<br /><br />I also have Oxy 30&#039;s I sell for $20 - $30 depending on quantity. so let me know if any of you want to try my stuff. I am SR if you want the protection of escrow, etc. (I&#039;m new here and there).<br /><br />Sorry if my BS is off topic or whatever but it seems in line kind of. my temp email is <br /><br />bruce.bb23@yahoo.com if you want to hit me up. Again sorry if I f&#039;ked up posting this.
