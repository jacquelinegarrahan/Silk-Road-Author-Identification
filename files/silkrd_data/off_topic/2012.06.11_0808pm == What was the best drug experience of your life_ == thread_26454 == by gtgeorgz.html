				So yeah, basically what was your best experience on drugs? and what happened? <br /><br />I&#039;m super bored right now and procrastinating coursework so it would be interesting to hear some stories..<br />for me it was probably the first time i ever did MDMA at a free party, but difficult to remember haha.. or last, last sunday night with mephedrone. That feeling where my mates and me are all on the same level on drone, going crazy to my favorite music, whilst attempting to hot box the shit out of the huge room we were in, oh my, was heaven.&nbsp; :D<br />

				My first MDMA experience. It wasn&#039;t long after my relationship with my girlfriend ended, she got with another fella quickly and to be honest if it wasn&#039;t for MDMA I&#039;d have knocked his teeth to the back of his throat. <br /><br />Ohhhhh that magical magical pill... I got a little nervous upon the initial rush but I when I peaked for the first time I&#039;d describe the feeling as &#039;floating on heaven with the gods&#039;. I plugged my headphones in and listened to my favourite Eminem track - &#039;Beautiful&#039;. I was amazed at how I could observe my situation without feeling any anger or sadness. I was on pure bliss...<br /><br />Nowadays my best drug experiences are with Mephedrone, most euphoric rushy stimulant I&#039;ve ever had.

				I once did 40 whippets while on a medium dose of 2C-P. That was the first time I experienced total dissociation.<br />I also once railed 4mg of 2C-P. That was the most intense trip I&#039;ve ever had.<br />The first time I did methylone was pretty good too.

				The first time my ex and I snorted her whole script of ritalin and we just stayed up all night and day just talking.<br /><br />Then when I tried e for the first time. I felt like a crackhead in the corner for the first half hour after I dropped and it hit me so fast and the ex and a friend decided it would have been cool to play Revolution 9 by the Beatles while my first time.

				OMFG.....I made that mix once...lol.....Kind of.<br /><br />Back in music school I crushed up an 20mg adderall with a 30mg oxy and a gram of street grade coke. I snorted that shit in little bumps for about two days (maybe three...cant remember) without sleep during my finals. And I remember my 5 mile walk too and from music school felt like it took 15 minutes.<br /><br />Looks like I was a NAZI......ROFL

				LSD<br />2 hits<br />plain white paper<br />roughly 5mm x 5 mm<br />no taste<br />2003 <br /><br />A light trip that made me feel so in love with the world, so unconditionally blissful, mindful- that I wanted to stay that way forever. I wanted to go out and ease people sufferings, to paint, make music, explore the mysteries of the universe - with the most childlike curiosity. Out of more than a thousand drug experiences, if I had to keep only one, that would be it. <br /><br />Under the influence, one can honestly believe things to be true, have a set of goals, ideas, priorities... but when the drug is no longer in effect, they can drastically revert back to normal. A life of being perpetually high on methamphetamine would likely not be a long and fulfilling one. So even though the labrat has tried every (relatively) popular hard drug, some of which produced euphoria beyond his wildest dreams, they were not the &quot;best&quot; experiences. Heroin comes second because it was a &quot;lower&quot; type of experience. It&#039;s definitely a giant, but after the experience, there was no desire to do much except sleep and get more heroin -&nbsp; and I judge an experience on its effect on me as human being.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I believe that this LSD trip fundamentally changed me. Despite all that I&#039;ve gone through since that time, I always remember that one piece of sunshine I was gifted - allowing for a more mature, positive perspective on life&#039;s shittiest moments.<br />

				Yeah yeah, the good old Nazi drugs...<br />Ever heard of &quot;Panzerschokolade&quot;? It means &quot;tank chocolate&quot; and it&#039;s a mix of meth and caffeine.

				It&#039;s hard to pick the best... one of my faves though is my first time with DMT. I didn&#039;t fully blast off on my hit but I was in half cartoon world half reality. I don&#039;t mean the kind of cartoon world most people think of when they hear about trips... it was too fun to explain.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />The same night after my second hit I traveled through a few different dimensions, it was pretty easy avoiding the red lightning.

				Yeah, I know what you guys mean. I have to prepare my mind to take a hit of DMT, I get a little anxious too. Once your off though, you really have no choice but to relax your mind and let it mindfuck you. DMT is extremely powerful, no lie.

And it is thought to be responsible for the whole &quot;after death experience&quot;.<br /><br />Check out : DMT - The Spirit Molecule

				K-holing, without a single doubt in my mind. Before the experience I thought &quot;yeah, I&#039;ve K-holed plenty of times&quot;. I was to be seriously schooled.<br /><br />It convinced me that ketamine was a true hallucinogen. At first I saw things around me change, the whole room was 2 tone black and red, as if it was a sketch, then I completely lost all external senses. Spatial dimensions seemed so trivial, they were part of a much larger universal structure, which I could move in without actually moving. For about 3 days solid after the experience I was trying to find someway of expressing it, or explaining it, I still can&#039;t explain it today, as is evident...<br /><br />weirdly, I can&#039;t remember my first roll, probably because I started doing it with really small doses, complimenting other substances

So far (in order) my best drug experiences are<br /><br />1. First MDMA pill (Got me over a broken relationship)<br />2. Drone + K, Still felt the euphoria from the Drone whilst tripping balls from the K<br />3.Drone on its own - Amazing drug, take it more than MD these days, you don&#039;t lose the magic with Drone.<br />4. Good quality Coke - I felt like the DON, like superman, could chat with anyone without about anything and the euphoria was great.<br />5. K on its own, I prefer K with stims, but K on its own is still an awesome drug.
