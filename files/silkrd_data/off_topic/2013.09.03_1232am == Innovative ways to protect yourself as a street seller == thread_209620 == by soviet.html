				(Reposted from Security...feel like this is more of an OT post. Woops.)<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that you&#039;re a small time dealer, moving &lt;$1000/month. How do you cover your ass on all bases? Most if it is common sense, but there are some problems that are rather intricate. <br /><br />1. Controlled buys. You sell to someone. They get caught or they give it to a friend who ODs and they get in trouble. LE gives them a sweet deal if they help set you, the dealer, up. Let&#039;s assume that all of your sales now are controlled buys. How do you protect yourself? Consider the following scenario:<br /><br />You force all clients to use casual code-talk when they call otherwise you won&#039;t sell to them. Your person calls and wants to buy. You meet up in a very familiar club/other crowded place that doesn&#039;t have video surveillance where you can easily discern whether LE is in the building. You sit in a dark corner, out of sight. You check your man for a wire. You don&#039;t leave fingerprints on your product. You make the deal. If LE tries to hit you now, you can say that you were just meeting up to hang out and you have no idea where your man got the drugs from (assuming you aren&#039;t in possession of more product)...right? Now if LE hits you BEFORE the deal you can either swallow the drugs very quickly, or run and dispose of them in some creative way. Either way, there won&#039;t be evidence enough to convict you of possession/distribution, right? <br /><br />Would this be plausible? This method may seem paranoid, but I doubt that anybody in the drug game has ever regretted being too careful. <br /><br />2. Communication. What is the safest, most convenient way to communicate with customers? Making everybody speak in code over the phone seems like a hassle. Would a throw-away e-mail work? One only accessed through TOR? The thing with using that e-mail is that you lose the plausible deniability of &quot;i was just meeting my friend here to hang out&quot;. Are there any useful apps I should know about?<br /><br />3. Storage. How thoroughly do police search your house? Do they check the backyard? Would having pets (ie cats) throw off the scent of the drug dogs? I know that the usual advice is to keep a clean house, but if that isn&#039;t an option? Would taking a bunch of weed/mdma/cocaine and rubbing and/or sprinkling it on the doors/walls/floors etc of the house confuse the drug dogs to the point of not being able to find your real stash(es)? Any super-awesome hiding spots? <br /><br />Any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated. I understand that LE monitors these forums, so if you have any sensitive info or advice that you don&#039;t wanna post just PM me. I&#039;ll send you my pgp key if you want. This is my second time writing this fucking post out because my browser crashed the first time. Let me know if omitted any key points. <br />
