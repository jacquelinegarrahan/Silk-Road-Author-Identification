				This newbie really appreciates everyone&#039;s contributions to the forums. But specifically I like Pine and Ballzinator just to name a couple. Whether or not they realize it, some of their comments have been extremely helpful to me. Im slowly digging my way out of a deep depression thanks to them. All the best everyone!

If people simply didnt agree with being gay they wouldnt have commented. You took the time to go into a lengthy tirade. It indicates some sort of issue on your part, I´m sure, where you are going out of your way to hurt people...

				There is one vendor/writer who stands out from the rest. He sells only in the ART section of SR. Who would have thought? Oh wait, nomad bloodbath did. Everything seems to be typical blackmarket until someone ventures into his odd corner of the market. Also he is a smart fucker for selling only art.<br />Not to mention his posts are glorious, though I have seen a minute fraction of them.<br />Im not sure how joywind chose his name.

				Guru and microRNA were both vast improvements on some past moderators from my readings through older threads.<br />Hate to see compassionate mods treated so bad they reject what they loved.<br />I really have no idea why they are not mods but it doesnt seem like there are any rly and a spam buster is still needed to fill that void.<br />Strange times.

				It&#039;s my understanding that all mods have been &quot;stealthed,&quot; and their accounts appear the same as anyone elses -- they just still have mod privileges/access.&nbsp; So it may not have been the case at the time of that paranoid thread (or it may have been), but either way... it seems the matter was resolved quietly and effectively enough.

There is no anonymous censor. This forum? Yeah, it lets you delete the posts you&#039;ve made. It&#039;s kind of hard to miss. Every post of your own has a big &quot;delete&quot; option on it. Why, just scroll up and see for yourself. Now stop being a paranoid fuck, for fucks sake.<br /><br />Fucking hell... at least know what people can do to their own posts before you go assuming shit like that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Oh i see - silly me. Im glad it was just me being retarded and not censorship.<br />BlarghRawr is currently my favourite SR peep.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, I&#039;m sorry I was mean about the way I said it, since you&#039;re nice enough to take it in good stride. Also, thank you for the vote of confidence. :)
