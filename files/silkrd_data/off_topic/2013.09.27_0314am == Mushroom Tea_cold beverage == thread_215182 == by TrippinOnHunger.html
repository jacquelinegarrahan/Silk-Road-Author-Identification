				Can someone explain to me step by step on how to make drinks with mushrooms?&nbsp; What kind of strains do you prefer?<br /><br />I saw a recipe of getting shrooms, mixing it in a drink and leaving it in the fridge for 1-2 days... But I dont know how much of what to use.<br /><br />I ask because Im thinking of buying an O of grounded penis envy but not 100% sure yet.

				I find it is best if your mushrooms are dried out properly so you can crumble them to dust with your fingers. Put your mushrooms in a pan with some boiling water and slowly simmer for about 20 minutes. Estimate how much water will boil off so for example. If there is 3 of you then pour 5 cups of water into the pan and after 20 minutes boiling there will be 3 cups worth left. Once boiled strain the mushrooms out. use a colander or even a pair of tights or something so you can squeeze all the juices out of the soggy shrooms into your brew. Then thats it. Fill up your cups! You can add tea bags if you want and milk or whatever because the taste is vile but I don&#039;t bother usually I just wait for it to cool a bit and down the full cup in 1 go. Another alternative is to chuck some jelly cubes into the pan with your brew in and leave it to cool and set. You will then have shroom jelly which is much easier to stomach if you hate the taste. Hope this helps&nbsp; :)

				You can also use a coffee grinder to grind the mushrooms into a powder. They should be as dry as possible for best results.

				You&#039;d make it like you would make any other kind of tea; Grind them up, heat up some water, let soak for 15 min or so.<br />I like to make tea bags out of coffee filters and string so there isnt many floaties in my tea. It is also good to make with black or green tea to add flavor<br /><br />have fun;)

				Hm, letting it simmer for 20 minutes? I read that the water should never boil and you should make it like a normal tea, with water just under boiling temperature and then let it sit for 10 minutes. With as fine grinded material as possible.

My method in the past, however, was to boil up around 100-150 Psilocybe semilanceata per person in a saucepan, simmer for closer to an hour or more then add the resulting liquid to tealeaves in a pot and brew as if it had been ordinary boiling water. Not only did they not seem to lose much strength but the mushroom taste became minimal (to the extent that a regular tripping friend once had a cup without telling me that he had to go to work later and never realised what had happened until he started coming up).<br /><br />That was in the past tense because I like my mushrooms self-picked (the feeling of personal connection to them seems important to me) and I haven&#039;t been hunting for quite a few years. I may very well do so this season, though :)

				Grinding shouldnt be a problem since Im planning on getting an O already powdered since SR prices on shrooms are ridiculously high...<br /><br />Thanks for the helpful information!&nbsp; How long can I let the tea sit without it losing potency?&nbsp; Can I make it in advanced or should i drink it right away or within the day?<br /><br />Also does it smell bad?&nbsp; If I make it at home while my moms home will she notice?

I know that they&#039;ve already been spotted around this part of England so the season is upon us. Someone who recognised me at Stonehenge in June told me that my favourite grounds in another area of the country have been covered in fungicide :( It seems, therefore, that I&#039;ll have to search around locally again (it&#039;s been so long that I can no longer remember exactly where the little local areas were).<br /><br />My semilanceatas are easy to spot – nipples on the top and skinny stems that bruise purple :) This guide might help for identifying other species (Clearweb): http://www.shroomery.org/12460/Psilocybin-Species
