				Just look at the threads in SR discussion, it is becoming unuseable due to the spamming and the number of people being scammed must be huge, which will in turn affect the reputation of the forum and the main site.<br /><br />Come on mods, sort it out, either add mods with spam removal powers, block any submission with keywords, give us a report button so that after 5 reports it is auto hidden until a mod approves it.<br /><br />There must be solutions that will work on .onion sites.<br />

				Well, I think you&#039;re being dramatic but yes indeed there are ways on improving the forum, I would even say many. It&#039;s just that I guess people don&#039;t have time as there are thousands of customers with tens of thousands of issues and enquirers and a hand of administrators that can properly look into these matters.<br /><br />I would suggest a monthly fee in order to post, and a board for newbies that a MOD can update from time to time. A-Z guide even tho it&#039;s there already, the wiki but noobs are sometimes idiots and don&#039;t bother to read it...<br /><br />There will be a change soon I predict because if we get pissed they also get pissed..<br /><br />

				This is not a problem that can&#039;t be conquered. There are some solutions:<br /><br />- adding the domain name of scam sites to word filters (for everybody with less than 200 posts)<br />- appointing a group of Spam Busters that can hide threads until a mod has verified them<br />- blocking threads that have the same title<br /><br />The SR management just needs to be willing to implement those.

				it is just php not rocket science it would be trivial to refuse reposts with the same content, or throttle posts from an individual user, or any number of other ways to deal with it even a sledge hammer to crack a nut run a script every 5 minutes that deletes mostly duplicated posts from the database.<br /><br />If the site admin is overloaded (although god knows deleting this crap must be more time consuming than putting in a fix) I&#039;d be happy to work on it for free they could send me the code I&#039;d fix it and send back the diffs for inspection, no security risk no need to reveal server location admin ID or anything.<br /><br />It is actually a bit of a worry if they haven&#039;t the time and smarts to quickly squash this kind of spam bot how safe are our bitcoin deposits, private messages, and transaction records?

				I think they&#039;d rather work at the SR itself rather than the Forum. Still, that spam could indeed be easily been adverted with a few lines of code. Even an automatic removal of all other offending posts &amp; the user itself.<br /><br />It&#039;s annoying that I also got PM-ed by the damn bot.

				Heh, good one owenk. I agree that SR could help change some minds. But then again, I don&#039;t see many politicians doing some MDMA to understand a bit more of themselves and the world. However, it&#039;s a matter of time until we, the users of SR, will hold more power on the world than them. They&#039;re dying. I&#039;m good with that :D.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as always, there will be THE FEW who will fuck it up for the many. In this case, people who abuse substances and damage themselves or the ones around them. First, we&#039;ll have to solve THAT issue. When there&#039;s going to be a license that you&#039;re smart enough to take substances or to vote, the world might advance a bit.

If you research these spammers, they are spamming many other forums, this is a widespread spamming and scamming operation. To be fair, the Spam Busters and some of the Global Moderators here are dealing with it much more efficiently then the other forums they are spamming on (some of the forums I saw the spam has been left there for days on end!). The people that fall victim to btkoin and their other guises, I hope very few are stupid enough to fall for such a scam, pages of spam across all the discussion fourms written by spam bots using random usernames that aren&#039;t proper words such as &#039;yhrtujytri65&#039;, if people fall such an obvious scam, I do feel sorry for them, but they should have been more vigilant, the scam is very obvious. Follow this post to keep your inbox spam free http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=52370 as for the spamming on the boards, let&#039;s hope DPR and the Administrators come up with a suitable solution in the very near future, and this never ends, long live the Silk Road forums! :)
