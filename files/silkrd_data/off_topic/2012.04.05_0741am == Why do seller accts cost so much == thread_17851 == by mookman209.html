				I have a decent amount of stuff i could end up offering! Even something thats not on the silk road atm (gabapentin/ neurotin)!! 300mg tabs!! but its too much to start a sr account up. and who knows I may have a few pain things / antivirus/ other programs/ services / random items n stuff haha I am sure i could fill a decent profile and eventually get my cash back . Oh btw how much would someone be willing to pay for gabapentin if you know what it is? I already have an idea from a few people but would like a second opinion on how much. BUT WHY SR WHY!!!

				I have a lot of decent stuff i can offer also but i for one am not complaining about the seller account opening fee at all its mere pennies if you cant afford it then how can you afford to sell stuff on here? Its that price for a reason if it was any less you&#039;d get alot more scammers and people that aren&#039;t serious.

				I wish the seller price was $500 honestly. If any one could sell scamming would be a major issue as the seller could simply say customs must have taken the item.

Ha ill have to save some of my sells of gaba and maybe buy one! haha if you see me on SR im going to be trust worthy haha, and hopefully a chatty friend :P.
