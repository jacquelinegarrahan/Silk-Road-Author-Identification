				Ok so now Jeremy Kyle is in the U.S has anyone from across the pond seen his show? Would anyone like to speculate who would win in a fight out of the following - <br /><br />Jeremy Kyle VS. Jerry Springer<br /><br />Jeremy Kyle VS. Mori (however the fuck ya spell it)<br /><br />Jeremy Kyle VS. Montell Williams<br /><br />Or a Royal Rumble between the 4 of them.....<br /><br />Sorry U.S....but your guys look like pussies compared to Jezza I&#039;m afraid.

				Jerry Springer doesn&#039;t fight, he turns away in disgust and lets his security handle it. Mauri (is that how you spell it?) would just confuse the fuck out of him as he brought out 3 screaming crazy ghetto chicks all claiming Jeremy Kyle is the father of their babies, paternity tests to follow.
