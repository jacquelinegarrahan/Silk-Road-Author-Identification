				I do it weekly.&nbsp; I find it really easy to make.&nbsp; Purging is the difficult part, but once you know how, I don&#039;t find that difficult either.&nbsp; I can do a batch in under an hour now.&nbsp; It turns out great :)

I&#039;ve noticed everybody&#039;s got their &quot;technique&quot; for releasing the butane into the chamber, but hers mine I hold the extractor tight an press slowly till I feel the extractor pressurized.. I continue to hold the tip of the butane in the extractor and begin to sort in a circle motion shake it up an down.. then begin releasing more butane into the chamber.. I&#039;ll do this 2-3 times.. last one with a good little shake..<br /><br />from there you can purge or just set the dish in some warm water and watch the butane start to evaporate away remember to wait for the butane to completely evaporate.. ;D<br /><br />as far as purging goes, I can&#039;t help you :P<br /><br />An please remember safety first! butane is a highly flammable (derp) so do your best to keep your eye brows an such! :)

				I don&#039;t know if you&#039;d consider me an &#039;OG&#039; lol, but this is essentially the method I use.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTVRYk0Zdg4<br />&#039;New Method for making BHO&#039; on youtube if you do not want to follow the link.<br /><br />This is kind of like the thermos method slightly altered.&nbsp; Another step I take is winterizing (removing plant fats/waxes/etc).&nbsp; To winterize from the last step in the video, wait for the butane to be evaporated mostly.&nbsp; Add enough everclear and stir it around to dissolve the oil in the everclear.&nbsp; Filter the everclear through a coffee filter(s) (I wet the coffee filter with everclear before filtering it to prevent loss of oil into filters).&nbsp; Drain everclear solution onto a flat collection plate (I use a square pyrex plate).&nbsp; I place the plate flat on top of a pot of boiling water (essentially a double boil) to evaporate the everclear.&nbsp; I scrape up the oil with a paint chipper holder thing which is made as a grip for razor blades.&nbsp; Depending on how dry you let it get, and whether it dries spread thin or as a pile, will determine the consistency in my experience.<br /><br />http://buymarijuanaseeds.com/community/threads/ethanol-re-extraction-of-butane-hash-oil.148673/<br />This is a forum post showing the winterization step I describe.<br /><br />It&#039;s a very cheap and easy process, I would recommend to any serious marijuana partakers.

You said your friend got 4 grams from a 1/2 oz? That would be a 35% return...never seen or heard of anyone getting close to that high of a return..except with bubble hash or kief that is..Perhaps he didnt fully purge or plant matter got into the oil like you said..<br />How fully and tightly are you packing your extraction tube?

				Does the yield make a difference to you per say?&nbsp; What you&#039;re doing is extracting the cannabinoids, and you can repeat the process a couple times if you&#039;d like to ensure you don&#039;t lose much if anything.&nbsp; I would say that it&#039;s more about how efficient whatever you&#039;re using to smoke/vape/whatever it is.&nbsp; Even I can make oil go a long way and I smoke constantly, but it&#039;s because I have an efficient pen vape made for concentrates.

				Bubble hash is so simple, doesn&#039;t involve petroleum products and doesn&#039;t need purged to further clean it.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll stick with that.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;ve made BHO plenty of times back before purging and before I found out that there is left over chemicals in it but I don&#039;t know anymore with all this purging shit.&nbsp; Bubble hash is beauriful, delicious and easier to handle. :)

				I use Everclear as a second wash to get rid of not only plant fats and waxes, but I believe it also gets rid of the left over butane.&nbsp; Butane dissolves in everclear, so once you evaporate all the everclear, the butane is gone.&nbsp; Butane is a non polar solvent, and grain alcohol is a semi polar solvent.

				Leave it to the &quot;professionals&quot;, unless ofc, you have the proper environment/equipment and knowledge to do so. Too many noobs blast a ounce through just a glass tube then heat purge it for a few hours, not realizing this is not the proper way to do it...There&#039;s so much misinformation out there I don&#039;t think anyone should try and make it unless they know 100% what they are doing. Kids blowing themselves up, people smoking hash not even purged, just people being idiots...<br /><br />Also, water hash is where it&#039;s at. Learn that, way more fun.<br /><br />
