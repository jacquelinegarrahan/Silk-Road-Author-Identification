				Im so pissed, I don&#039;t know where to begin.&nbsp; I have absolutely no enamel on my teeth and have been told by multiple dentist that ill be needing dentures or something for years. Well, im in my mid 40&#039;s and while I haven&#039;t taken care of my teeth like I&#039;ve should have, there is no reason why I should be losing all my teeth.<br /><br />Im getting some implants soon and my dad knows that I take opiates ALL LEGAL!!! The first words out of his mouth were &quot;its all those drugs you took&quot; Are you kidding me? I would like to see one scientific study saying that opiates cause you to lose your teeth, especially when you have very bad enamel and other factors. <br /><br />When I tried to argue this fact, all he could say &quot; I dont believe that&quot; I did say that the only stufy that I have seen is called meth mouth, but that has nothing to do with opiates. And opiates do make your mouth a little dryer and can cause a little trouble, but not that much...<br /><br />Can any of&nbsp; you provide any studies that sway either way? I would appreciate it.. <br /><br />Im so pissed, I could spit my last tooth out!!!

				If your opiates cause dry mouth that would be similar to meth mouth.<br />The dryness allows bacteria to grow. Other wise I haven&#039;t heard of anything that indicates<br />that it&#039;s drug related.

				I&#039;ve been doing drugs for almost 10 years and I have great teeth. I brush/floss daily and visit the dentist every six months. It&#039;s all about maintenance.

				I was told at a very early age that I didn&#039;t have hardly any enamel at all. Plus,I would only brush my teeth a couple times a day and floss just a few times a week. i tried daily, but hated it. So, Im sure its a lot of factors. but for him to come out and say &quot;its all those drugs that you are doing have cause it&quot; yet he knows that I only take prescribed medication. And that doctors would know if that was a concern. <br /><br />When I told him that the only thing that I&#039;ve heard of is meth mouth is mainly because they just dont care about their teeth, he scoffed at that. and basically shut his ears. I sent him a long email asking him to find me any credible evidence that that taking pain meds causes your teeth to fall out. I could hear his wife in the background telling him to shut up. but people are so one tracked minded. He thinks that I have this huge drug problem (little does he know that I only take a small percentage of what i take and get rid of the rest)<br /><br />It just pisses me off. Im sure hes sitting back thinking, &#039;well, you shouldn&#039;t have done all those drugs&#039; What the fuck?&nbsp; I have only took what the damned doctors prescribe.... I guess he knows more thant they do, fucking idiot...

				Did you live in an area where they put fluoride in the drinking water.&nbsp; They did where I grew up and when my parents moved us to an area that didn&#039;t, my brother and I had to take a fluoride tablet every day to assist enamel growth on our teeth.

				I sometimes go a week without brushing my teeth, I&#039;ve flossed maybe 10 times in my life and haven&#039;t been to the dentist in over 14 years yet I&#039;ve got beautiful teeth.<br />Here&#039;s my formula:<br />Protein + exercise = healthy teeth (and healthy everything else).

				well at least your excuse sounds a little better than mine, my teeth are literally in bits, i have 3 totally broken ones, and not a single tooth without a filling/hole/crack, also all 4 of my wisdom teeth rotted out, was this from my wanton drug abuse? no its because i lived and worked in a pub for many years and when youre running round like an idiot sweating youre bag off its all too easy to down that half pint of pepsi to quench your thirst, little did i realise i was drinking 8-10 pints a day of the stuff, its worse for your teeth than fucking meth im sure. but yes ive had many people assume its somehow to do with the drugs ive taken, people (usually clueless people) seem to love to throw that accusation around as the first line for any problem you may have

				In the past I&#039;ve had issues with opiates. I don&#039;t think they can directly cause enamel decay, but when I was on opiates I craved sweet drinks like crazy and drank way more soda than I should have (I&#039;ve heard that&#039;s common on opiates). That&#039;s what I blame for my dental problems.

				Sorry about your teeth&nbsp; man. People who don&#039;t use drugs can be very ignorant at times. It sounds like your Dad doesn&#039;t have a clue.
