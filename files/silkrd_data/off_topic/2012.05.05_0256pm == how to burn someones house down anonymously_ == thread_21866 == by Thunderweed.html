				Some dude fucked me over by giving me a wad of one&#039;s surrounded by a 100 for a QP, then drove off quick before I noticed. I have his cell number, and my friend is working on getting his address. We plan to burn his house down, does anyone have tips for doing it anonymously?

				You didn&#039;t even look past the hundred in the roll. BIG MISTAKE!<br />I&#039;d say the best way to do it anon is to get someone else to do it and make sure you&#039;re far away with an alibi, just in case.

				IMHO not worth it for a QP mark it down as a life lesson and move on.<br /><br />buut if you are set on burning his place down, are you certain no one innocent will be affected? wife/kids? it may seem like a easy thing todo but be able to live with the consequences..<br /><br />&nbsp;

Lol.<br /><br />It really depends in all honesty. <br />How large of a house does he have? <br />What kind of neighborhood does he live in?

				Break in when he isn&#039;t there, ensure all windows/doors are shut, set up a matches so they strike upon opening the door, pull the gas pipe out the back of his oven to start a gas leak, leave without being seen. <br /><br />If you live within 1-2 mile radius you&#039;ll hear if it&#039;s worked.

				Use a laser to ionize a path towards his house from the sky during a lightening storm. I can&#039;t take credit for this idea though.

				Just mind fuck him, do completely random things to his house like leaving animal parts all over his drive way/garden right messages in latin all over his house, just completely mind fuck him for months until he snaps and has a mental brake down, THEN burn his house down.

				I honestly don&#039;t know the details of how it works, but the smart people who I listened to talking about it made it sound like you can pretty much use a laser to make an enormous lightening rod over a target

				the best way to get an alibi is to go to a party near by where you know everyone is going to be piss drunk. when everyone is passed out/too drunk to notice dip out for a bit and set up the gas line /matches on the door like has been said above and come back to the party and crash. that way you have an ass load of people to back up your alibi to some degree and if they say they saw you dip out you can just claim that they were intoxicated and you stayed the entire night. maybe leave your shoes on so that you can have marker marks to prove your presence. I&#039;ve heard that sitting at home and playing some vidya by yourself also works but there&#039;s nobody to back it up

				Honestly, just from what you&#039;ve said burning down &quot;his&quot; house is unjust. It belongs to his parents, don&#039;t punish them despite the fact that they raised a pile o shit. Instead, figure out the parent&#039;s work or home numbers and take away his money that way. You could go all over with it, pretend to be a cop, warn them of his dealing. Maybe ask them to toss his room to find it. Or you could pretend to be a scary drug dealer, make some idle threats. Regardless you can get him long term instead of hurting innocents.<br /><br />-Cheers

				Get a cigarette preferably super king size or put a few together with a rolling paper, get an old match book and stick the cig in the end of one the match&#039;s put it near a pile of newspapers at his door, or someone or soak the newspaper in petrol then chuck petrol over his door, or doors, then run like fuck and be out the way before the fire starts, it&#039;s a sort of time delay works awesome as fuck upto 5-15minute delay.
