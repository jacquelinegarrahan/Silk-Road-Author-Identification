				Why not a prepaid debit/credit card?&nbsp; There is also physical gold which would be easy to store and anonymous to sell in small amounts.

Somewhere in your home where only you know it will be.<br /><br />Take a trip to a sex shop and/or go online and there are all kinds of &quot;safes&quot; that look like household items you can stash your bread in.<br /><br />Honestly, you can walk into any grocery store or Target or Wal Mart and buy gift cards and make ALL your purchases like that, anonymous. You have to use cash to buy those cards.<br /><br />Part of your problem solved.<br /><br />If you are just super paranoid, I can PM you two sites I use where you can get reloadable anonymous Visa/Mastercards without ID verification. Really meant for international travel, but you get the picture. I hope this helps.

				Mason jars are a bad Idea because they have metal rings so metal detectors can find them so use plastic 1-3 gallon ice cream containers (no metal no Detection) also they are water proof

				There is a guy on HackBB who is selling anonymous debit cards loaded with cash in exchange for bitcoins. I have never used this person so I have no idea if they are legit or not. However, the website does have escrow and it&#039;s been around for just over a year so if you are willing to trust them you can give it a try.<br /><br />The link for hackbb - http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion
