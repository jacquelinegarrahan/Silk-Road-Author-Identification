				He clearly states they are fake, that&#039;s why he hasn&#039;t been banned -- if you purchase it knowing it is fake, I don&#039;t think you can claim &quot;scam!&quot; when you receive it and confirm that it is indeed fake.

				Respectfully, please explain to me how this differs from the vendor selling forged silver.<br />Direct quote from you:<br />&quot;The entire purpose of these &#039;forged&#039; bars is to deceive others.&nbsp; Counterfeit currency is not permitted to be sold here.&quot;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164931.0<br /><br />Yes, I see the word currency. But wee all know that OCs are far more valuable than gold.<br /><br />And counterfiet X pills containing pipes? Please justify why this is oay when we all know the dangers of piperazines, a compound nobody would intentionally ingest. Yet we all know they&#039;ll be sold deceptively to people who do not know any better.<br /><br />I strongly object to this and believe it&#039;s entirely unacceptable. Tell me why this is acceptable in your eyes please.

				I do see the OP&#039;s point, selling fake drugs can only have so many uses.&nbsp; The most likely of which would be for resale on the road or in real life which could potentially cause people to get scammed or not get their pain meds.&nbsp; &nbsp; They could also be used as placebos to see if someones pain is all in there head.<br /><br />Who knows but the vendor is using SR and staying within regs.&nbsp; If our only concern is that people will resell this stuff as real then even reputable vendors selling real goods run the risk of their customers cutting their products for resale, there is always risk in non regulated goods.&nbsp; <br />

				He states very clearly that the listing is for fake pills or counterfeit pills both in the listing title and its description.&nbsp; Unless DPR says otherwise sometime in the future, it is not prohibited.

				Ah, well if he recently got caught and changed his descriptions then that is shady indeed.&nbsp; I hope people don&#039;t buy from them and check the forums.&nbsp; Who would buy with someone with such low feedback.<br /><br />Maybe people just like to gamble and complain so they find vendors like this to do so.

				Yes, people ARE buying despite his feedback. Why are some people still buying these fake pills even though they are now labeled fake? To defraud people on the street/IRL. <br />You can see by the feedback that the majority of buyers are happy with their fraudulent purchases. What scammer wouldn&#039;t be? <br />Try to conceive the many types of harm that could come to people on down the line as these fraudulent pills get sold and distributed.<br /><br /><br />The silver guy was also upfront about his bars being fraudulent. I man sure, the SR charter/rules state fraudulent cuirency is prohibited. But drugs are the reason this site exists. Is it really good for the community to deem fraudulent drugs acceptable?<br /><br />To be clear:<br />These are not &quot;knockoff&quot; gypsie pills. These are DUMMY PILLS, void of any active compounds AND/OR pills that contain DANGEROUS chemicals such as PIPERAZINES with no use other than to defraud unsuspecting individuals, IRL or outside of SR most likely. And from that, many individuals are likely to be harmed in a number of ways from toxcicity, death, defrauded of their cash, pain unmanned, addiction unmanaged, and violence IRL.

				Ok, one more time I&#039;ll explain what this Vendor did!!!PLEASE READ!!! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.<br /><br />He stated his pills were from India, they are counterfeit, but they were NOT BAD QUALITY, and BUZZ is still good. This is now between to of his postings for endocet 10/325 and the IR 30mg Roxies.&nbsp; His review looked good, this was over 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; The reviews were obviously fake, I know that after the fact.&nbsp; After the submit buttons was sent, two more reviews come in declaring they were all fakes from two other buyers, no active ingredients.&nbsp; I tried to cancel, and too late.&nbsp; Received product, and yep as fake as fake can be.&nbsp; Selected link to my purchased items and whoa! now it says he is &quot;giving away free fakes?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; It&#039;s ALL a scam, this vendor needs to be suspended.&nbsp; Other people are saying similar to what I&#039;ve been saying.&nbsp; See the 5 + different threads on this Vendor.&nbsp; He has been reported to moderator, admin,&nbsp; been in resolution with more multiple buyers and still he sells here!!! WHY WHY WHY!&nbsp; Yet there is another thread stated from yesterday about his benzo&#039;s being weak to nothing.&nbsp; Look up his name, you&#039;ll see it everywhere

				Mossman you are correct.&nbsp; I am a chronic pain management person. The pills left me with an incredible headache, I was very concerned what the hell I had ingested.&nbsp; This man is going a double whammy on us.&nbsp; Ist he lies about the pills, say they are counterfeit, and maybe not as potent, but hey for the price they are not bad.&nbsp; Then he changes the description of the product you purchased and states well man you knew they where fakes at that cost per pill.&nbsp; Now, for some people, the money they spend here is all they have and out of desperation, a buyer may try to defraud someone on&nbsp; the street or even here to recoup.&nbsp; This is ALL bad for the SR. It will leave honest legit buyers with a pricing dilemma and a potentially bad reputation.&nbsp;

				I purchased two sampler packs from this vendor when he was first getting started, one was a 15 pill &quot;benzo&quot; sampler pack, and a 10 x 30mg &quot;oxycodone&quot;(the paranthesis are mine, not his). At the time, he only had a couple reviews, and the were all positive, and he had one review on the forums, which again was positive. His description specifically said that they were unlicensed productions from India, and he didn&#039;t know exactly how much oxy was in them, but they were good, just not as strong as regular ones. Seeing as the patent had just expired, not that Indian pharmacies really care about that, I (and apparently many others) were led to believe that the pills would contain some oxy and have some effect, hence the low prices. <br /><br />When the package finally arrived it came with no stealth precautions, and with out giving out to many details that could endanger others, it was sent in a way that the package could have been searched with out a warrant, and once it was opened it would be clear as to what was being shipped. When I received them I sampled them myself, and gave some to trusted friends so I could get someone else&#039;s opinion as well. I fully explained to my friends that these were bootlegged from India, and while they were advertised as containing oxy, i didn&#039;t know exactly what was in it. <br /><br />No one felt anything from any of the pills, and one person even banged it(I did try and convince him not to bang it when I watched him prep it, and was concerned with its appearance)! The vendor included &quot;bonus&quot; items which consisted of two &quot;endocets&quot; and 2 &quot;bups&quot; (8mg orange stop signs) which I gave to a friend to try because I don&#039;t do subs. He did one himself, and gave the other to a friend. My friend took one while he was dope sick, and he was still dope sick after taking it, so it had no positive effect; however his friend that took it is bi-polar, and regularly takes subs, but when he took this &quot;sub,&quot; he had a severe negative reaction to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;As far as the &quot;benzos&quot; are concerned they seemed completely inert as well. I started small, and kept taking more, and never felt anything. I received 2mg Xanax mints from another vendor a little over a week later, and I felt more from a partial 2mg mint then I felt from multiple pills from Greendaddy888. <br /><br />I contacted Greendaddy888 and explained my issues with the product, and he immediately started verbally attacking me, and calling me a scammer. He has since changed his listings, to say that the pills are fake, which was not clearly stated originally. He also has several reviews on his page that only state &quot;product as stated&quot; or &quot;returned for a refund,&quot; but when you try to see the items they are no longer posted, which leads me to believe that he created items with a price of $0 simply to have reviews that he could use as examples when he is in resolution. I have not released funds, and taken both orders to resolution. I originally was going to release the funds and just leave a bad review, but because of his shitty attitude, product, and straight up unsafe practices, I am taking it to resolutions, and hoping that the admins see things my way.<br /><br />TL;DR: Vendor is a lying, scamming, piece of shit, and is a danger to customers and the road.

				I understand that clearly.&nbsp; Often times we all can become over zealous with our purchases, and yes that can lead us to trouble. However, this was bait and switch.&nbsp; He said one thing and and I read it very carefully, it was my first purchase and I was so cautious.&nbsp; I read the wiki, the Q&amp;A section, and read the forums and asked questions w/o spamming to 50. I saw he had good reviews (at the time).&nbsp; I did everything &quot;right&quot;, and what can I say?&nbsp; He changed (edited) his vendor page description on his products, and it made me look like I was the fool that didn&#039;t do the homework or research.&nbsp; All of us can be conned at one time or another even when careful. Here more so than anywhere else.&nbsp; There is limited protection here and the law is not on your side.

				Not to be an asshole but really the best thing to do when in doubt is do a google image search on the photos the Vendor has on his listing. I knew greendaddy was fake as shit because i&#039;ve seen those same pics on Indian trade sites and I knew they were fake by doing a little research on the image and then on the company that had said image. I feel bad for the buyers that fell for it as I knew it was but I guess some people can&#039;t pass up a good deal. This is also another reason why I think new Vendors should be required to as part of the acceptance have to send a sample to say a &#039;QA&#039; designated by SR to ensure that the products they are selling are authentic. Who will consist of the &quot;QA&#039; team and how they get appointed is a whole another matter but that&#039;s a subject for another thread maybe. At this point I would think that Greendaddy should be banned. If you look at his wording he doesn&#039;t say that the pills are bunk and shit he said they are fake and may work according to your tolerance which is not something that can be gauged effectively. Bottom line is he&#039;s a sleazy slimeback trying to make a quick buck off people that probably don&#039;t have $300 to waste of pills that don&#039;t do shit!
