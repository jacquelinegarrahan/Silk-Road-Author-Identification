				This may be a bit controversial, but has anyone considered selling human body parts through SR? There is a huge market for kidneys, livers, eyes, skin, and whatever else that can be extracted from the human body. SR has the potential to connect seller to buyer of this exquisite market. With the number of wars, conflicts, and human deaths on a daily basis, there is a lot going to waste.&nbsp; Why not start a business in human body part acquisitions and sales?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The ethical debate is BS; there is a supply and demand in human body parts.&nbsp; Lets earn a few BitCoins on that extra kidney, after all are you really using it?<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				Totally ignoring the moral debate, well, doesn&#039;t seem like there are many people who visit Silk Road in search of a new kidney. Silk Road gets a bad enough reputation for selling drugs; I don&#039;t think selling various body parts would improve that image.

				I agree that there should be a&nbsp; place to go to sell body parts. Moral issues aside if someone can save another person by giving part of his body where is the harm.I would be more than ready to sell a kidney or part of my liver. I admit I am not doing this for humanitarian reasons, but with the money I can keep my parents out of the nursing home longer.

				As much as I love the libertarian and free-market principle which would enable willing sellers to offer virtually anything to willing buyers without government interference, in practice it&#039;s a bad idea. If you want to sign SR&#039;s death warrant, then start selling body parts. <br /><br />As it is the recent WIRED article was a very mixed blessing. Yes, it alerted thousands of potential users to the existence of SR, and thus guaranteed there will be a huge influx of new buyers and sellers. But it also alerted politicians who started salivating at the thought of how much media coverage they could get if they led a fight to take down that &quot;evil website that is selling those demon drugs to our precious kids!&quot; And they won&#039;t care that the necessity of bank accounts/PayPal, the identity verification process and then the problem of acceptance of delivery pose such problems for minors that few if any could ever use SR. <br /><br />But rest assured that because SR has been revealed to the world, there will be serious official efforts to destroy the site and/or destroy its anonymity. Offering body parts, or kiddie porn, would make the notoriety worse, and would result in even more scrutiny and intensified efforts to thwart SR. Don&#039;t do it.

				No. Because there&#039;s no way to determine how the body parts were obtained, and like CP, the fact that they&#039;re worth money provides an impetus to producing more, and that could involve breaching someones consent =&gt; The precautionary principle is necessary.<br /><br />QED

				&nbsp;:) For the right price, I&#039;m in. Kidney, piece of my liver, skin graphs, blood, any other fluids, lung, whatever. Did I leave anything out? I AM IN IT TO WIN IT BABY!!! We can agree on a price and medical services, details, details, and more details. We can then go to the hospital and get it done. And my bank account will SKYROCKET!! I&#039;d update my will and go for it. It&#039;s a win, win situation for EVERYONE involved. Put it in the open and it becomes safer. Transplants...... Happen EVERYDAY!!! Doctors make money on it. The hospital, tons of others I am sure. It&#039;s a money game. And I&#039;d like in on it. I know I can help some RICH person and there family. Nothing wrong with helping out. I am also an organ donor. What&#039;s the problem? I didn&#039;t die and got paid? <br /><br />OKAY. SAY I DID IT AND IT WENT WRONG. My bad. I knew what I was getting into. It&#039;s risky. But it&#039;s my body and I alone choose what I do with it. So if I die on the table or worse later on after lingering, that what wills are for. D.N.R!! Damn!! <br /><br />I also agree w/assisted suicide. It&#039;s your call when you want to go. IT&#039;S&nbsp; MY CHOICE AND MY CHOICE ALONE!!!!!

				The only way for this to actually work is not through a system of posting items for sale. Rather, exactly the opposite method would work. <br /><br />A site would need to be constructed where the buyer would post what they need.&nbsp; <br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />(“I need a kidney ASAP, I have been on dialysis for 10 years, my doctor gives me 6 weeks to live. <br /><br />I am willing to pay 10 k for the organ, which would include proper shipping, 3k finders fee after implant, and 3% to the website. <br /><br />Age: 24<br />Location:&nbsp; USA<br />My doctor: Alfred E. Newman, MD.”)<br /><br />Another example might look like:<br /><br />(Seeking a penis: My ex-wife just made international news when she cut mine off and tossed it in the garbage disposable. Color not important, larger the better.)<br />

				ok uh.... fucked up. theres alot of things we &quot;should&quot; have the right to do, and DO have the right to do, assuming we dont get caught... that we really shouldnt be doing. if the argument is honestly HONESTLY about saving lives, and we are debating possibilities within THIS community, it would be far more constructive and rational to begin seeking out DOCTORS who know what the fuck theyre doing, and get a bunch of pros on the side of the under-the-radar movement. opiate users will tell you that if youre seeking true pain treatment that the doctor isnt giving you, do you go buy a bunch of heroin to self-medicate? no. thats just for fun. you find some actual clean, legit drugs, combine with physical therapy, and try your best to self-medicate in an educated way. selling human body parts via usps is fucking barbarian and does NOT lead us towards a more enlightened self-governing society. if anyone wants to work on making me a fleshlight out of a real vagina however, please PM me and i will buy ;)&nbsp; ~smod
