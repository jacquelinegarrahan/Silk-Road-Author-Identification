Would be nice if he did but he takes a massive risk for us all. We still have a pretty top notch service here, even with all of the above problems :)

I&#039;d like to think SR is ready to be passed on to a trusted acquaintance, most likely inigo. Seeing as they&#039;re a few steps ahead of the law, no doubt they&#039;re thinking ahead and have things planned we couldnt imagine. <br /><br />Long live the road
