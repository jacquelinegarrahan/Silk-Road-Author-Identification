				Firstly, I have not been here since early February and am rather dismayed with what I have returned to see. Largely that a lot of big trust-worthy weed (my poison) dealers have disappeared. Where are OrganicBuds, Baroso, HashUK, GreenGiant to name a few? Did they break the new OOE rules or just leave?<br /><br />And why is everything more expensive now despite the fact that BTC prices (previously around £3, now still around £3) are still roughly the same?<br /><br />If anyone has any info on OrganicBuds where-abouts specifically then I would be very interested in that.

				There is a whole thread on UK vendors in the rumor forums<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11298.0<br /><br />Things change, but nothing bad happened to them, as far as I know.

				I&#039;ve noticed this, too.&nbsp; I only get weed and the odd thing here and there, but I have noticed that a lot of vendors have disappeared, and prices have gone up.&nbsp; Also, small personal amounts have all but disappeared.&nbsp; Weird stuff.

Things change, rules change, so vendors change.<br />Maybe you remember before their fees increased?<br /><br />tvlies,<br /><br />Yep, it seem that was needed for you UK guys so I reference it.<br />Is customs harder for you, aren&#039;t you in the EU?<br />Seems like very little getting past N/L

				I&#039;ve avoided the N/L for that reason. Everything else has come through fine except Holland when he ripped everyone off (he was supposed to be posting from Belgium).&nbsp;
