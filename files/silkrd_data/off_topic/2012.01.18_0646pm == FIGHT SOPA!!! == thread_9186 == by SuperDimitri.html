				It won&#039;t affect the deep web in any way, so I&#039;m not that upset about it. I&#039;ve been waiting for the people to take back the power for the government for awhile now. Maybe this bill will push us over the edge.

				So? This is a game of poker, and Lamar Smith holds the nuts.<br /><br />Lying in wait, also sponsored by Smith, is H.R. 1981, the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act of 2011. It&#039;s not complete. You see, PCIP isn&#039;t contestable because it&#039;s about protecting the children. They can, and very well might, copy and paste the full text of SOPA to the end of PCIP. That&#039;s the backup, much how the SAFE Port Act was for the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.<br /><br />That&#039;s the deal that was struck with entertainment industry lobbyists. We will try to push this anti-piracy bill. It probably won&#039;t work. Don&#039;t worry, we can pass it under an anti-child pornography bill.<br /><br />There are two things which no Congressman will risk supporting: terrorism and child pornography. It&#039;s a third rail, there can be no opposition, no discussion. Any anti-piracy law can ALWAYS be reframed as an anti-child pornography bill and it will pass, without even discussion.<br /><br />The entertainment industry has finally caught up with technology. They understand how it works. It took them 15 years, but they know what DNS is. They are going to exploit a fundamental problem with the way DNS is centralized and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. They have found an error in the very architecture of the Internet. The solution, from a free speech standpoint is not to fight it politically. The solution is to fix the error.

				Not related to SOPA apparently, but even Megaupload one of the largest file sharing/hosting companies is no more and has been pulled down by the US Government. Extremely sad especially since I had a lifetime membership that I bought off here. But yeah we really need to fight bills like SOPA. Great thing was that even Google and Wikipedia fought against them. Only way they can ever win is through apathy on the part of the public.
