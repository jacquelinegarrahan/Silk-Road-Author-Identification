I&#039;m a huge comedy nerd, so I could go on and on. Have you seen any of Louis CK&#039;s specials? Shameless and Hilarious are fucking killer. Find some Bill Hicks stuff from before he turned bitter, epic mind blowing stuff when you&#039;re high/tripping. Besides being a genius comic, he puts some mellow musical interludes between the bits on his albums, so it&#039;s great to listen to when you&#039;re nice and baked.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never listened to Ricky Gervais&#039;s podcast, you should definitely check that out. Him and Steve ridiculing Karl never gets old. Doug Loves Movies is a great, and free, stoner podcast. Really funny, though it helps if you like movies, like a lot.<br /><br />Man, I could just go on and on. Since the &#039;90s, alternative comedy has come a long way from those old Jerky Boys and Sandler albums I used to listen to. Much fertile ground, many great comics. While you wait for further suggestions, I&#039;d heavily recommend checking out Marc Maron&#039;s WTF podcast. It&#039;s great in its own right as funny and thought-provoking comedy, but it&#039;s also great for getting introduced to new comics. And for getting a sense of the history of comedy (actually very interesting and entertaining subject matter), and for building your comedy brain.

I am literally a stand-up comedian JUNKIE, I could watch stand-up all day. Some of my favorite comedians in no particular order are:<br /><br />Patton Oswalt<br />Daniel Tosh<br />Doug Benson<br />Mike Birbiglia<br />Aziz Ansari<br />Zach Galifinakis<br />Bill Burr<br />Demitri Martin<br />Brian Posehn<br />Nick Swardson<br />Anthony Jeselnik<br />Amy Schumer<br />John Mulaney<br />Bo Burnham...<br /><br />There are so many more if only I could remember them, lol. That&#039;s a start, though. I&#039;ll warn you, the dumbest shit cracks me up, some people probably think alot of these comedians are pretty lame, but these are some that I love...

That&#039;s a great list! Top notch one and all. Now if you had said Denis Leary (stole from Bill Hicks), or Carlos Mencia (stole from Greg Giraldo) or Dane Cook (stole from Louis CK), we woulda had words. But all those people are top notch, hilarious comics. A few others that come to mind:<br /><br />Patrice O&#039;Neal (Elephant is one of my favorite stand up specials, dude died way too young)<br />Greg Giraldo (ditto on the dieing thing&nbsp; :&#039;( )<br />Tod Barry<br />Stephen Wright<br />Mitch Hedgeberg (again with the dieing young&nbsp; &gt;:( )<br />George Carlin (an early master)<br />Bill Cosby (arguably best every, with the way he could people a stage and tell a story)<br />DL Hugley (his recent special is great, and Kings of Comedy is one of the best stand up movies ever)<br /><br />and man, so many more. That&#039;s the great thing about comedy podcast, you get introduced to some many great comics, it&#039;s amazing how many are working these days.

				#1 is Partice Oneal .. Was luck enough to see him in some small clubs a few times.. He was 100% the funniest person Ive ever seen..<br /><br />Jim Norton is funny, seen him a few times a month ago we scored front row seats to his show..<br /><br />Jim Breuer is one of the best sorry tellers Ive ever seen live. He is a very clean but off the charts funny..<br />

The interview he did for Maron&#039;s WTF is as great as you&#039;d probably imagine. Such an amazing comedic mind, totally underappreciated relative to his comedic talent.<br /><br />Oh ya, Saggot is great! So dirty, sick and funny. His cameos are also great, was hilarious in his stint on Entourage.

				I don&#039;t see how any married (or divorced) parent can go past Louis CK<br /><br />You can find practically all his stuff on youtube. His two seasons of TV are great, but more subtle and smarter than his stand-up (no criticism intended, his stand-up is awesome I would kill to get a ticket).<br /><br />He did an HBO thing where he sat around with gervais, seinfeld etc and just chatted about being a comedian. He made seinfeld visibly jealous and uncomfortable when he described how he throws out his best stuff constantly in order to force himself into new territory each year.

I&#039;m not huge on his stuff when I&#039;m sober, though he&#039;s really funny on Qi, but his stuff is pretty great on 400ug of LSD.&nbsp; :P
