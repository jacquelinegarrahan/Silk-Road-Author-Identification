				So, I was meant to be chilling out for the night. Then a few friends called over and one of them made this drink called &#039;Comotion Potion&#039;.<br />Holy shit, this stuff is unbelievable! <br /><br />Preparation: get a 2 litre bottle of anything, and empty it!!!!<br /><br />Ingredients: 500ml Jegermeister, 1 x 250ml can Red Bull, 1 x 500ml can Magner&#039;s cider (any cider will do), 350ml Rum. We used Captain Morgan, but i&#039;m sure any would do ;-)<br /><br />Last ingredient to this concoction: a gram of MDMA thrown into the bottle.<br /><br />Give it a good shake and enjoy! :-)<br /><br />Half thinking of adding a disclaimer here, but I know everyone here is a responsible adult!

				How much of it did you drink? Sounds very delicious... To be honest, I don&#039;t really care for alcohol mixed with MDMA but I do experiment with it from time to time, but I&#039;ve never really thought about just putting MDMA in a liquid and drinking it.<br /><br />Does the type of liquid effect how well the MDMA works? Is this an efficient way to take MDMA? I&#039;d rather not waste any, but this seems like a fun way to take it. I&#039;d love to have a can of Red Bull mixed with just MDMA, has anybody else tried anything like this before?

Not over doing it, but we&#039;ve gone through about 3/4 of it at this stage, between 4 of us. I am new to this drink, but my friends said they have done it before. I&#039;m not sure if it is the alcohol, but we are all fairly twisted now. Not too fucked though, as I am still able to type. Very nice feeling though, that I had to share with my new social network!! :-)<br /><br />I can&#039;t answer your question about how well it works in the type of liquid or how efficient it is as a method of taking MDMA. All I know is I feel great and i&#039;m having a great time with some great friends! Try it out and see how you like it! I&#039;ll take full responsibiity if you dont like it! ;-)<br /><br />

				Definitely going to try this soon, I&#039;m getting over an ounce of pure MDMA in a few weeks so this should be interesting. I&#039;ve got plenty to spare so I&#039;ll experiment. I&#039;m going to try the following:<br /><br />MDMA dissolved in:<br /><br />Water<br />Red Bull<br />Coca-Cola<br />Red Bull with various amounts of vodka<br />And the Commotion Potion!<br /><br />I&#039;ll let everyone know how it goes!

				Looking forward to a second review!<br />OP you are surpisingly tame for drinking such a mixture. I find that alcohol does typically change a roll drastically. <br />Very drunk + .1mdma = really fucked up and dissasociated<br />Very rolling + 2 or 3 shots = very happy and focused but a little more giggly and suprisingly energetic from some oberservations

I&#039;ve been doing MDMA/pills for a lot of years now and I never get so fucked up that I can&#039;t talk. <br />Am surprised at my typing ability tonight though!<br /><br />MDMA just makes me appreciate music more! If you like dance music, we are listening to this now and i&#039;d highly recommend a listen. It is definitely an MDMA kinda track:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyyzx_Nq0-Y<br /><br />Have mentioned that guy in a few forum threads, but he is really good...enjoy ;-0<br /><br /><br />

				My friends said a warm hello to you as well. They can barely talk at the moment though, so that may be a bit of a lie!&nbsp; :) It is a good intentioned lie though, promise!<br />I have no idea what they are saying in that song and i&#039;ve listened to it sober as well. Your guess is as good as mine. Probably better at this stage! ;)<br /><br />Here is what is on now:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30wlhehSgDI<br /><br />Leftfield, they are unbelievable! If i&#039;m intruding on your music for the night, tell me to shut up! I think you&#039;ll enjoy that one though!

				Booze kills my MDMA buzz :( always regret drinking when I take it. In my days hanging out in techno clubs I never drank any alcohol, just rolled and used amyl nitrate. I like getting drunk and using speed, nice combo. Cocaine is nice with a few straight shots whisky (but not too many).<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;d still swig the bottle when it comes my way :P

				@BanWork<br />I&#039;m not a heavy boozer myself but couldn&#039;t pass up on this one when it was going around. Have to say though, I have enjoyed it very much!<br />Very nice buzz, except my mates drank alot more of it than me and they are not able to talk at the moment; hence my heavy uise of this forum tonight!!<br />Me and whiskey don&#039;t go welll together at all!

I used to love walking through the city at 7am to get a taxi with my laser sharp MDMA mind, normally I appeared sober too, unless I I&#039;d gone overboard&nbsp; and had some major gurning going on. Sometimes I&#039;d get a shower and go straight into work at 8:30am.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Haha, didn&#039;t realise you where swigging this stuff live! I&#039;m jealous. Sober here.<br /><br />With that I&#039;m going to bed! Have a good night psychedelicmind :)

				Yeah I just google &quot;youtube converter&quot; and click usually just the first link, you put in the url of whatever video you want, and it gives you the audio in a file you can download. Unless you meant audio and video?

I&#039;m just looking for audio so I can put it onto my ipod! Thanks so much :)<br /><br />Well, it has been fun guys but i&#039;m going to crash out (more than likely be back soon enough) and see if I can sleep!<br /><br />Enjoy the music. Here is one last tune before I go to sleep. Hope you won&#039;t mind that it is a chilled out track! I need it so I can come down a bit :-)<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHjxwHwSRN4<br /><br />Peace :)<br /><br />

				Quick question for you guys. Can you just drop MDMA in most drinks and still get it&#039;s full effects? After reading all of these post that is what it seems like to me.

				As long as it&#039;s not basic (no milk!) you should be okay. If it&#039;s slightly acidic like a soda, or has alcohol, that&#039;s great because it will absorb the MDMA but filler will just get left behind on the bottom of the glass.

				No problem, let me know how it goes/what you mix it with. I&#039;m going to be trying it as well, sounds pretty fun.
