				This started as a product request but I am not sure of the product i am requesting so thought i&#039;d slapped it up in the main discussion for some answers. <br /><br />I a looking for some heavy duty pharmaceutical banned substance that gives you a donkey slong without too much side affects or needing to top it up.<br /><br />Ive heard of the infamous penis pump and I know pornstars use viagra for the performance but what about just generally wangin&#039; out?<br /><br />If roids shrink ya balls then is there a drug that increases the shaft?<br /><br />I know you all been thinking about it.. and before sum1 says it, I dont have a small dick! its average, just like most average people who watch porn and think jesus christ the black dude wud probably kill my girlfriend.<br /><br />I dont want a horse sized pole, just a donkey sized slong? Let me know im sure the Chinese have something for this, they have something for everything.

				The classic Mexican bridge stretch method. <br /><br />Its a myth I am afraid, although it can if done correctly stretch your cock the results dont last long and at maximum stretch or after completing the method you have little chance of using the snake like beast. <br /><br />Unfortunately I was a bridge bandit, it gave me the temp stretch before almost ripping my cock off and thats why im here looking for heavy duty porno pills. <br />

				unfortunately you&#039;re quite right, jack.. the pharm industry does indeed make much more money treating symptoms than coming up with a cure, and they&#039;re the ones funding the research on the drugs, so... cures are less helpful to those who pay to for the research. :( sad but true.<br /><br />at least we can all have 6hour boners. who can be sad with a 14inch 6hour boner? until you need the priapism stinted and drained of blood and then the drugs give you a heart attack.. oh, damn. :(<br /><br /><br />and actually, Tramadol is sometimes prescribed off-label for premature ejaculation.

				There are no pills that make your dick bigger. There are a few that increase bloodflow that will give you raging erections, but nothing can really make your dick &quot;grow&quot;. There is, however, penis enlargement exercises that you can do (ie; jeqling), but it is extremely long term and you can end up doing a lot of long-term damage to your dick.&nbsp;

				This will help you for free unless you invest in the products which they endorse as well. The guy who runs the site has gone from 5.25&quot; to a little over 7.5&quot; (forgot width) but it takes many months to years of consistency and discipline. Many fail due to the instant gratification and expectations of common folk. There are muscle fibers within your mangland that react the very same way as bodybuilding your biceps would be. Micro tearing and allowing recovery to rebuild the tissues bigger, longer, stronger is very possible if not inevitable. <br /><br />http://www.goodlookingloser.com/exercises-to-increase-penis/ (http://www.goodlookingloser.com/exercises-to-increase-penis/)<br /><br />You can also find logs of guys running the Bathmate + SizeGenetics + Jelqing + Manual Stretching within the forums on the site if you require more proof of results.<br /><br />As far as pharms for increasing genetic potential, I think I read he endorsed using Cialis with PE sessions to increase blood flow for more muscle abrasions. <br /><br />If you want stamina work on kegels, reverse kegels, edging and breathing techniques. Or take opiates. <br />

				I pulled on my cock to stretch it since I was a kid. Thank God I did - now I have an average cock. What if I hadn&#039;t stretched it? I might have a tiny one!<br /><br />BTW if you have a tiny one then date Asian chicks. Like a tiny-ass Philapina, she will rock your world.<br /><br />I banged this one itty-bitty girl from Spain. She was a doctor and I blew my wad in her and she was like, &quot;I wanted you to pull out!&quot;<br /><br />I probably have a 20 year old Spanish kid somewhere.
