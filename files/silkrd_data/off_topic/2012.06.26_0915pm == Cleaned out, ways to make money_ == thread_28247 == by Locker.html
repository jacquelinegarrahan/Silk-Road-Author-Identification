				So I&#039;m in Napa for the next 10 days bitches! 8)&nbsp; Thing is though, I&#039;ve spent nearly 3k total and have cleaned myself out completely. Just recently got layed off from my main job, so I have no decent source of income, ontop of daily smoking.<br />Legal or not, I am not looking for anything that can make me a bit of money, either in the long run or temporarily, without getting arrested. ::) Any tips?<br /><br />Locker.

				Start selling drugs.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t fuck up if you don&#039;t want to get arrested.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to do too.<br /><br />Follow these rules - <br /><br />1. DON&#039;T BE STUPID (this means plan, prepare, have an exit stratregy, always have a plan a b c and d)<br />2. Be amiable (The more likeable you are, the more likely you are to spread into people&#039;s social circles and provide them with some &quot;fun&quot;)<br />3. Be HONEST. Those with the most honest product get the best business. Also always being available won&#039;t hurt =).

				dude, if you are really stuck in Napa and need money fast go to LaborReady in Santa Rosa and do some ass-bustin&#039; work for a couple of days, they pay cash at the end of the day. Not the most glamorous option but if you need money it is money.<br /><br />**disclaimer** I do not live in Santa Rosa, but I did at one time. Napa wine is not nearly as good as the stuff from Sonoma county, especially if you hit up the little hideaway wineries. Think it is the Russian River-water that makes &#039;em special.

God it was disgusting, nothing but fat people smoking living off of welfare everywhere you look. &gt;:( Seriously sickening to say I live in the same country as them. Luckily I stayed in Edmond inside the Oak Tree Golf &amp; Country Club gated community where the rich and educated live. ;D Practically every house was a damn mansion, it was chill as fuck.

				there are soo many ways of making a good living. It is basically what Lim said. How far would you go?<br /><br />If you ask here you are probably searching for a cheap way to make profit, good luck in that project, hehe. Best would be make a sub for a vendor here or something. But do not expect an easy job. Earning money is mostly hard work.

				Back to the original question asked by OP my suggestion to you is since your in napa you could sell your arse hole and make a little extra if you don&#039;t use vasalene so I&#039;d say €20 for a good arse ripping other than being a spunk bucket you could always suck instead like your mouth can make babies but I reckon you&#039;ll only get €5 for that though if your willing to do this holla back and I&#039;d be able to sell you in a second ok but seriously though the sore backdoor will be the best money spinner ha ha ha ha ha hope you like this answer mate poor backdoor

Sure is a powerful drug but comes with many side effects an I recommend researching before use!!

				As am I but let&#039;s apply logic before asking for personal experience from anonymous people on the internet. 5 people could post &quot;I do it all the time - no problem&quot;. What is that going to do? Change the projected odds of imprisonment in your head? Is that going to be enough for you to risk it? I don&#039;t care if you have plausible deniability - your ass is going to prison if you sign for a kilo of a scheduled substance sent from China. I would be extremely hesitant ordering ANYTHING international to the US. If you are willing to accept a significant risk of a long imprisonment - go for it. If you are not, don&#039;t. Don&#039;t let what any vendor or person tell you about the odds. The odds don&#039;t matter. INTERNATIONAL = DANGEROUS. Much much more dangerous than anything domestic.

				did you have no luck with the nBOMe?<br /><br />if you have a thousand bucks, even selling it at around $5 per hit like you were suggesting you could make good money<br /><br />you should be able to get around 5k tabs for 1k. Even selling for $5 you make 5k. you won&#039;t be making that in the US with 10g of coke......<br /><br />other than that you could get 2CB powder. check it in gel caps. sell for 20-40 for 35mg tabs which would have people tripping hard.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s the point in all the suggestions. You don&#039;t seem to be listening to any of them. As Hoff said, that just makes you look like a kid.
