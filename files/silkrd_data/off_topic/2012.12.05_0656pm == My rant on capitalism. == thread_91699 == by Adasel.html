				I am so sick and fucking tired of the way the modern western, capitalist society operates without regret or remorse.&nbsp; Bank managers fuck up and make mistakes, guess what, they get a huge fucking bonus totaling in and probably over half a million pound.<br />They fuck with our money and can afford to buy two homes, two cars and cheat with our taxes.<br />The BP oil disaster.&nbsp; What the fuck has happened since BP spilled all that oil and ruined the area wildlife and destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds who fish there?, FUCK ALL.&nbsp; People are SITLL waiting for payouts.<br />Just before i go, i would like to make a point on car construction within the uk.<br />I was watching an episode of Top Gear recently, and i believe they said that in 1914 in the uk, there were something like 137 car companies that produced, sold world over and made us money.<br />Do you know how many car companies there are that are uk based and sell within the uk economy now??<br />absolutely fucking none.&nbsp; Its just not the cars, its that the uk does not produce and sell anything anymore.<br />We exported ALL of our business.&nbsp; And who suffers for that?, we do, the little man.<br />Seriously if nothing gets done about this i might have to start thinking of plans.<br />Feel free to answer or not, i just needed somewhere to post this and this is where it felt best.<br />Thanks.

Why do you think China has the jobs?

The corporations are not to blame. People don&#039;t give a fuck where their money goes they just want to pay less money for the same shit.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you want better manufacturing jobs in the UK then you would need to stop the millions of consumers who want to buy their cars from China because it&#039;s cheaper.

				Today&#039;s modern western capitalist society is so far removed from what could be called a free-market that claiming it to be so is ridiculous.<br />Corporate welfare in the form of banker bail-outs is a form of government intervention in the market, thereby interfering with prices set by supply and demand.<br /><br />I think your rant is against the symptoms of western government.<br /><br />I think most of us agree about the problems of the symptoms, whatever the cause. But we may disagree on the cause and end goals.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think damaging private property is an answer, the cost would be passed to the consumer or employee. Do you think the investor is going to take the hit?

I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being clear on my point. EU immigrants will work the same job for less, you&#039;re right. So the employer has two choices:<br />1) They hire the immigrant and then probably sell their product cheaper or:<br />2) They hire the guy who wants paid more and then they will probably sell the product for a higher price.<br /><br />So company A chooses 1 and company B chooses option 2. If they actually cared they wouldn&#039;t give their business to company A. When it comes down to it, consumers don&#039;t give a fuck about where the products come from otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be giving all their money to China or the companies that hire EU immigrants. The consumers have spoken and they said &quot;Fuck him, I want my dvd player for £10 less&quot;. <br /><br />So if you want a well paying job in the manufacturing industry: in the UK either find demographic that are willing to pay extra for a product that&#039;s made in the UK or ... move to China.<br /><br />

				One member of the ILF is definitely lolling this argument between Nugget and Adasel, cuz it&#039;s just so damned capitalistic!<br /><br />Yeah, so, uh, guys ... let&#039;s just go back to basics here.&nbsp; The difference between corporatism and capitalism isn&#039;t, for our purposes, very useful.&nbsp; The ideal capitalism that everyone gets all horny over is probably a stylized version of the American 1950&#039;s plus a pinch of being-kept-honest-by-the-people-around-you.&nbsp; (For a great and brief description of this ideal American capitalism, read Garrison Keillor in _Lake Wobegone Days_ ... but for the sake of the here and now, this is the crux of the matter:&nbsp; The guy who makes the eyeglasses in town doesn&#039;t exactly always have the best selection, nor does he necessarily have the best prices -- you could go to St Paul for that.&nbsp; But the town optician also is the town&#039;s EMS, so if you need help one night, it behooves you to have patronized him in the past.)&nbsp; In other words, you know and you care for the people around you, and they know and they care for you, so you do good work in which you take pride, and your town gets along swimmingly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Great.<br /><br />But real-world capitalism -- the kind with capital and means of production and profits and stock markets -- comes along and says, &quot;Your life sucks because you don&#039;t have cool things.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you take up this new way of life?&nbsp; You won&#039;t be part of a community any more, and you will pay, with money, for every single move you make; but it&#039;s totally worth it because, like, seriously, how steaze is it to have an iPhone?&quot;&nbsp; And you really don&#039;t have a choice, for if you happen to belong to a community that&#039;s not already on board, you will be put on board with a quickness.&nbsp; Literally, in chains, on board a ship crossing an ocean. <br /><br />Okay, yeah, that was a long time ago.&nbsp; Except for it&#039;s happening right now to the Bayaka people in Cameroon. <br /><br />Okay, but still, whatever, they&#039;re not the UKers who have lost out on jobs, and that&#039;s what we&#039;re talking about here, people, right?&nbsp; &quot;Jobs, jobs, jobs&quot; as the politicians chant.&nbsp; The point is, Nugget&#039;s cynicism is correct.&nbsp; &quot;We&quot; the general public don&#039;t care about labor standards, because we only care about saving as much money as possible; and so if we can buy our goods cheaper cuz they&#039;re made with slave labor, we really don&#039;t care.&nbsp; We have proven that by our track record.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t even have to say a word.&nbsp; But the reason isn&#039;t just because we the general public are selfish.&nbsp; The truth is, we the general public *could* be not selfish, but our entire system is set up to be selfish from the beginning.&nbsp; <br /><br />We didn&#039;t ask to come into this life, and we certainly didn&#039;t ask to come into this economic system; but if we want to continue living, which we are required to do in almost all nations on earth (that is, there is no active right to die) unless we choose the serious amount of pain and/or the almost universal taboo in committing suicide, we are forced to use money.&nbsp; (Okay, you can go live indigenous, and I WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with that, but, again, I&#039;d like to point out that the imperialists are not stopping anytime soon.)&nbsp; So if living equals money, which it does, then it makes sense that we are motivated to hold on to as much life (money) as possible; and if it means someone works as a slave, well, then, we the general public tell ourselves, &quot;There&#039;s nothing I can do.&nbsp; Every man is for himself.&nbsp; It&#039;s a zero-sum game.&nbsp; Ah, well, it&#039;s probably not that bad to work in that factory, really, I mean, if you&#039;re stupid or Chinese or whatever.&nbsp; They&#039;re not like us anyway.&quot;&nbsp; Whatever it is we tell ourselves to get by.&nbsp; It&#039;s what we tell ourselves about the &quot;problem&quot; of immigration too:&nbsp; These newcomers are not like us; they are dirty; they are lowering &quot;our&quot; standards.&nbsp; It seems to me a limited definition of the word &quot;us.&quot;&nbsp; MLK said that if any of us (meaning all of humanity) is a captive, then none of us is free.&nbsp; But it looks like a lot of people don&#039;t really feel that. <br /><br />And yet we still are miserable, both because we have been selfish and untrue to our best nature and because we cannot find happiness in consumerism anyway.&nbsp; The lie of capitalism --of modernity in general-- is that stuff will make you feel better than community.&nbsp; It is to me so EVIDENTLY a lie that I am surprised anyone is left still arguing it.&nbsp; (Does anyone need proof of our collective despair?&nbsp; Depression/obesity/alcoholism rates skyrocketing in the &quot;modern&quot; world?&nbsp; Third leading cause of death in Americans aged 0-24 is suicide!?&nbsp; Seriously guys?!&nbsp; Just checking!)<br /><br />But here we are, trying not to despair, for we are altering our brain chemistry.&nbsp; Thank the West for the Road.&nbsp; Okay, yes, the Silk Road is a market, and it is competitive.&nbsp; But because it exists outside of real, physical place, and because it is, here&#039;s the big one, voluntary, it is unlike any economic system we&#039;ve invented words for.&nbsp; It is radical.&nbsp; I dream of a world which can somehow be real and physical, connected to the natural world, and each other, and also voluntary.&nbsp; (Yeah, I know, it&#039;s not &quot;voluntary&quot; to be alive, to need to eat, to need sleep and shelter ... but the goal, I think, is to find a harmony, a beauty, between how you must live and how you would choose to live.)<br /><br />So I guess I am ready to move on.&nbsp; Let&#039;s get past this whole zero-sum game thing, what say you?<br /><br />THAT is this member of the ILF&#039;s rant on capitalism!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

This is simply not true. <br />Employers are required by law to pay at least minimum-wage, doesn&#039;t matter where the employee is from. In fact I&#039;m pretty sure this is the case in the UK, because it&#039;s basically EU-wide legislation. Of course there are some employees who pay their workers a lower, off the books, wage but it does not have anything to do with East-Europeans specifically. <br /><br />The problem is the mentality, work ethics if you will, that (most) people in the &#039;Western&#039; world have developed over the years. <br />People don&#039;t work more than required, call in sick for every crap-ass excuse imaginable, constantly question authority, rather sit at home than do manual labor and Eastern-Europeans are simply better, higher, educated than &#039;we&#039; are. This mentality problem also drains down to people picking a 10$ cheaper product from China over something that&#039;s made within the borders. They simply do not care, know (or want to know) or even think about it. <br />&quot;Aww yeaaa this saves 8gbp now I can get me some extra fish &#039;n chips hurr hurrdurrrrr, let&#039;s watch some more talentshow durrdurrdurrr&quot; <br /><br />Eastern-Europeans are not payed less, they COST less. Why? Because they are: never sick, don&#039;t complain, do what they are told, work hard and have followed a decent education. Yes, communication is harder because they don&#039;t speak English (at least fluentl). But in a few years this will be a non-issue, the level of education in Poland for example is getting on par with that in the UK. <br />Something to think about is that Poland had their first free election in 1991(!) but are already surpassing the UK in many fields. <br /><br />One example: You are obliged to stay in school till a certain age, for the UK this is 16. After that you can choose whether to continue (and gain more knowledge etc..) or quit school and start working/collecting welfare. Within 2 years after that age, 52% of students in the UK are attending a school. In comparison with &#039;the job stealing countries&#039; :<br />Poland 90% <br />Slovakia 90+%<br />Czech Rep. 95%<br />Lithuania 95%<br /><br />Even in Turkey more people attend schools after they are no longer required; 65% <br /><br />Sure, employees from the UK (or any other country, for that matter) prefer to hire their fellow Brits. But they simply lack mentality, this is in fact a problem seen in a lot of countries and one of the main reasons Eastern-Europeans are so &#039;popular&#039;. It&#039;s simple supply and demand; employers want hard working employees and they are found in Eastern-Europe. With the EU joining of the 8 countries in 2004 those countries could also move workers freely through Europe and meet the demand.<br /><br />This is what&#039;s wrong in the UK:<br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-20317983<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">New figures show there were more than 2,000 unfilled vacancies at Jobcentre Plus in September - 70% of which were full-time positions.<br />Meanwhile, about 5,000 people aged 18 to 24 in Hull are claiming jobseekers&#039; allowance at any one time.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />::) <br /><br />Damned socialists and their welfare. <br /><br /><br />I will now end my amphetamine infused rambling&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br /><br />

I don&#039;t read the Daily Mail.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If i find some figures, i WILL post them, dont worry.&nbsp; I am just talking from personal experience and every day life of what it is really like to live in the uk.&nbsp; It was only in the last couple of years that the bbc started publishing the &quot;true&quot; figures that we were seeing on the tv on a daily basis.<br />I would like to say though, the only country in Europe right now that is growing its economy is, have a guess????????<br />Poland.
