				Weed £10 for a gram<br /><br />MDMA £35 - 40 a gram which is worse quality than SR<br /><br />Coke £50 a gram but just like Kappacino this stuffs been stepped on numerous times, probbaly more so than Kappacino&#039;s local stuff.. I would never buy it from the streets round here!<br /><br />E: If I were to get an MDMA pill we locally call them &quot;ten pound gurners&quot; so they&#039;re priced at £10 each.. I think the MDMA content of them is in the region of around 100mg.. nothing special!

				In TX<br /><br />Weed: Almost always $20/g for some actually really good dank then $5/g, $10/g for mid<br />XTC: Crystals are none existent. Pressed pills usually $10 (generally bunk) Molly power pills $20 (usually not pure) and no one rolls off just one pill<br />Coke: $40-$60/g but wouldn&#039;t put that shit next to my nose. All my friends think coke takes 45 minutes to kick in fully -_- <br />Shrooms: $10/g (questionable quality)<br /><br />Fuck where I live. Full of stoners and everyone is too lazy to have decent connections outside of weed. And I fucking hate smoking weed.

				Weed: $300/oz +- $50 depending on quality.<br />Dirt weed: $500/lb +- $50<br /><br />Coke: $40/g - sometimes good, sometimes not so good. Most people buy more so it&#039;s not that bad. Very abundant and competitive market.<br />Meth: $60/g - usually good quality from what I hear. <br /><br />White Heroin: $50/g - Heard it&#039;s pretty good actually but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s cut somewhere down the line.<br />It is also sold in &quot;heroin ounces&quot; which is slang for &quot;a bad deal&quot;, they sell it in 25g and call that an ounce. It sells for $1000 for a &quot;heroin ounce&quot; (25g=$40/g)<br /><br />MDMA: unavailable but at last check it was $80-100/g and cut to hell.<br />E Pills: $4-15 - usually shit but sometimes good. Not common.<br /><br />Shrooms: $10/g and very uncommon. <br /><br />Opiate pills are usually $0.50/mg with variation of +$0.50 based on neighborhood.<br />

				Coke €100/g - quality is OK, but wouldn&#039;t be anywhere near the quality of SR stuff.<br />MDMA €60 - €80/g - quality is good usually, but not as good as SR stuff.<br />Weed €20 - €25/g. I don&#039;t smoke weed, so never have to get robbed at those prices!<br />Ketamine €50/g. Paid £10/g in the UK once, so refuse to pay €50 back home!<br />Pills €5/pill. Only good value drug I can get my hands on in real life. They are every bit as good as the pills on SR.<br />LSD €5-10/tab, when it is available. A lot better value than SR, but still glad of SR to get it when there is a shortage here.

				So what do i buy to test the purity of my coke? cause if I&#039;m paying $50 for 1.8 g and it&#039;s as good as i think it is, I&#039;m going to laugh at people paying $100 for a gram.

In fact, in some areas its even 24g, from multiple unrelated dealers (so its not just one guy fucking with his buyers over a single gram). I suspect its because it can be evenly broken down without half g&#039;s involved (so a half oz would be 12g, a quarter would be 6, etc).

				Meh, i can agree with you to some extent pharmer. In the aspect of some chronic green, i would usually go for quantity over quality. I mean, i wont pay for dirt weed, ever...but i mean, 150 - 200$ an ounce for some decent mid grade, thats a fuckin deal for me. <br /><br />But ive gotten ounces of Weed for 80$ that looks like someone ran it over with a truck and all the buds got stained brown and clumped together.

				I honestly don&#039;t even know my street prices because drugs are practically non-existent here other than really shitty ecstasy cut with god knows what. There&#039;s obviously weed because I&#039;m so close to the Mexican boarder, but people give it stupid names and their own prices even though it&#039;s all terrible quality anyways. I just buy mine from a friend with a stellar grow-op, or from a local caregiver because our laws don&#039;t allow dispensaries yet, nor do they allow medicinal marijuana on college campuses which is the stupidest fucking law I&#039;ve ever heard. &gt;:(
