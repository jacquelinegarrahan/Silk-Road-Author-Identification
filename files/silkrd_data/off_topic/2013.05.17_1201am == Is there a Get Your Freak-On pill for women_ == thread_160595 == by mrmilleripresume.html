				<br />Sometimes, one wonders which drugs would be the best suited to bring out the sleazy qualities in a mid-40&#039;s housewife. Something that is safe, yet allows her to drop her inhibitions more. :) Any suggestions?<br /><br />

				<br />That would seem to be the perfect thing, would it not? But alas, we must now take into consideration that while alcohol can produce the desired effects, it almost certainly would also produce others that are not acceptable.<br /><br />We need something that will lower the inhibitions as alcohol can, just without the accompanying annoying and unpredictable drunkenness.&nbsp; ;)

				GHB is so underrated in this regard (consensual sex). 1-2.5 gram for both of you. Forever Jung has amazing GHB.<br /><br />Adderall/Speed/Amphetamine&nbsp; Meth is probably too risky and way too hit or miss here on SR. Adderall (which I&#039;m nearly positive I&#039;m spelling incorrectly) is by far the most reliable option and IME the most effective.<br /><br />Put those two together and your wife will rape YOU. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m 100% serious. <br /><br /><br />There&#039;s a good chance she&#039;s on an SSRI/antidepressant. For many women these interfere with arousal. Viagra helps some woman overcum this. FWIW.<br />&nbsp;8)<br />-LBB<br /><br />

				Acually there is a pill specifically for women that is the same as an Orgasm. the pharma co LILLY has had it for some time now. I can not recall the name of it off the top of my head but I do know they have it and it has been used. Don&#039;t know about the marketing, the male dominated CEO&#039;s probably squashed it out of fear.&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp; Tiz true!!

				Heard of foxy? 5-MeO-DiPT? I&#039;ve never done it but some people put it in shitty ex pills because it enhances the &quot;love&quot; of your roll. From what I can tell it just makes you insanely horny<br /><br />food for thought

				<br />Right on, right on...thanks for the replies. I&#039;ll look over the GHB. Not sure what it is, but that&#039;s what Erowid is for I guess. :)<br /><br />Of course we&#039;re talking consensual sex.. I just want to make her unnaturally consent to freaky sex involving circus clowns, rubber chickens and leather.&nbsp; Maybe a gang bang or something....nothing too serious lmao
