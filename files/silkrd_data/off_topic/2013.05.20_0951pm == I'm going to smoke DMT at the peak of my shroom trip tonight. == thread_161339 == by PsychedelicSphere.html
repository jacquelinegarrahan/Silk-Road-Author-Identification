				Well guys, I&#039;m new here and I&#039;m trying to get active on the forums and whatnot.<br /><br />Tonight me and four friends are tripping on shrooms. They are golden teachers and my buddy got them, they aren&#039;t from silkroad. Were doing an all night trip and just going all over the city should be a good time. We are each going to take an eighth. <br /><br />I&#039;m planning on smoking the rest of my DMT I got from elvis during the peak. I have around 50-100mg left I don&#039;t really remember. I hear it is one of the most beautiful experiences and I hope to share that with y&#039;all when I update this post in about 12-15 hours!<br /><br />Anyway, have any of y&#039;all smoked DMT during a shroom trip? If so, what was it like? I know a good bit of people have smoked it on an LSD trip, but I don&#039;t have any Lucy right now. <br /><br />Well I hope to see y&#039;all soon! ^_^<br /><br />Good vibes!
