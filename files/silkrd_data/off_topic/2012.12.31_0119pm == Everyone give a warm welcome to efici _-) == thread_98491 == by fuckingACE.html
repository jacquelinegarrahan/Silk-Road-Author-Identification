Yes we will be. I have some normal opium to list, theres an issue with my precision scales, they don&#039;t mark right.., need to head down to efici s neck of the woods to recover my old ones.. I will probably head down on Friday,,, Or maybe buy some new ones.. But they&#039;re hard to get to 3 points for cheap..<br />Right now I have normal opium and opium stolen from the Bayer fields in Spain. Its a very very strong dark opium. almost black and comes in very hard slabs, very brittle. when you snap it it shatters like glass. Here I&#039;m uploading the getafix blotter pics so I will take a pic of the Bayer opium I have and post here.. Im not sure on the sourcing of this opium at the mo It was procured from a friend of a friend and is very very rare, Not many people have the bollocks to walk onto a Bayer opium field and steal the opium. This harvest coming however we have something planned :D for now I will list what I have but it is expensive.. If i secure a steady supply I will lower the price accordingly. for now I will list 1/2g listings max of the stuff as I only have a bit, <br /><br />ACE

				Thanks guys. <br /><br />OK here are the images of the Bayer opium <br /><br />http://wuakd3inzzy5iz4w.onion/files/18097f3fbaee7f4c3b0b23163114a42e.jpg<br /><br />http://wuakd3inzzy5iz4w.onion/files/813b82b6c226fa56bf75809614984278.jpg<br /><br />Now compare that to our old fresh opium <br /><br />http://wuakd3inzzy5iz4w.onion/files/a38345732cb3f179ec3589d42523ec39.jpg<br /><br />completely different. Our old opium is very good, its just fresh and takes a bit more to put you in nod land.&nbsp; it provides a mellower buzz when you smoke the same amount. The Bayer opium, gram for gram has a much higher morphine quantity because of genetic engineering.

				hey hey hey!!! HELLO everyone, sorry it took so long to get on but i&#039;ve been having computer issues and had to wait for ACE to come help me out with it.<br />As ACE said i live in the mountains, but have access to all sorts of goodies depending on who&#039;s around at the time.... This is the first i&#039;ve heard about internet drug sales and i have to say i&#039;m intrigued by it and getting a little bit excited about spreading some very high quality drugs around the globe..... I hope you&#039;re enjoying the acid, and next will be some of the best traditional moroccan sativa hashish that i&#039;ve ever smoked.<br />peace out...efici
