				Are there places in the world where they are tolerant of someone discreetly farming shrooms? My research suggests that the Czech Republic cares the least about such things, but does anyone else know of other countries where it&#039;s tolerated?<br /><br />I get the feeling that most of Asia is uptight about it and the Middle East is no good and Africa is more or less a war zone and the U.S. is turning into the next Nazi Germany. So that pretty much leaves either S. America or Europe, with the Czech Republic being the most tolerant, at least on paper.<br /><br />Anyone have any experience living there? Would it be possible to buy one of those forged passports to get residency there?

				The trick to growin shrooms if you&#039;re worried about the law is to plant a load of spores into a substrate and transfer them to an outside plot. (obviously in the right season)<br /><br />It&#039;s not illegal to have shrooms growing on your property if it seems as though they naturally grow there.<br /><br />Tbh growing shrooms, even inddoors is very low risk. No smell, no suspicious lighting etc.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t go moving to another country just to grow them

				psilocybin Liberty Caps grow in abundance about half a mile away from where i live, lol, i can go and pick tens of thousands if i took the time, they come out about september.<br />also on another note, they are legal in ireland if they are still wet or just picked, they are only illegal if they have been processed or dried out, lol<br />i have tripped for over 25 years on these little bastards, lol, <br /><br />http://z.hubpages.com/u/110653_f520.jpg

				I grew shrooms for about 6 months, They are very easy to grow, all of the materials required are easy to get and not watched (with the exception of a spore syringe or print) As long as you are very thorough, and follow strict sterilizing rituals(disinfect work area, sterilize surfaces, turn off all fans, etc.) You wont lose any jars to mold, i never lost a jar during colonizing&nbsp; There is no smell(maybe slight when they are fruiting, but you only smell that when you get right up on your terrarium to harvest or humidify) They dont require a lot of space, and they dont need crazy hot HID lights....If your climate is right for it, Mashmans suggestion to move your colonized cakes or medium outdoors to a discrete plot, youll end up with a nice little almost never ending forest of mushys...if you are lucky they will come back next year when the temp is right. Id suggest The Shroomery forums, everything is there. <br /><br />I started with the intention of personal use....they were my first psychedelic and I had an amazing experience....but after a few months of weekend visits to happyfunland it just became less special....and I found that the more i thought about it, the more that would invade my subconscious and color my trips. I ended my run with mason jars full of dried p. cubensis in my pantry and a huge tupperware container full of shroom chocolate squares. So when you talk of moving to another country to farm, im not sure what you mean.....are you taking acres upon acres of medium? giant buildings filled with row after row of grow boxes like the legit gourmet mushroom farms use?

Cubensis,which usually takes a week or two to colonize in jars, and then another week or so of fruiting once you move them to a terrarium.<br /><br />I had the most intense trips by picking them right off the cakes and chewing them.....but nausea is most intense with fresh..at least for me..and when that became an issue,&nbsp; I stopped eating them fresh.....some potency is lost when drying, but not much....if done properly.

Possession of these minor amounts is allowed and won’t lead to a criminal charge. Before December 2008, unprocessed psychoactive mushrooms were legal to possess, they were not covered under the opium law, therefore making them legal to possess, consume and sell, and could be obtained in &quot;smart shops&quot; which specialize in ethnobotanicals.&quot;<br /><br /><br />TWM<br />

				Discrete growing should be undetectable, but depends on the scale<br /><br />Gathering wild psilocybe in forests is popular, though, in many countries
