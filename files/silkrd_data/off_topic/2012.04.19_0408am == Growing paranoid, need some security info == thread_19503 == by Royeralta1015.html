				Hey SR,<br /><br />So as most of you know, TFM is down and the last few days I have been growing paranoid. You see, I had an outstanding order that was labeled shipped on April 10th yet I know for a fact that the address I used was not erased as the DEA took over the site. Now as of yet I haven&#039;t been able to get into contact with other buyers to see if the police was going to crack down on buyers as well. And this is where I need help. I need to practice some safety precautions, I mean if the product was to arrive the most sensible thing I probably shouldn&#039;t do is enter my house or even open the package. So what now? What do I do if I find myself holding the package one of these days? What would you do?

				I understand you&#039;re worried, anyone would be. However, I think the chances of you getting arrested are minimal at best. The DEA already released their indictments and information about the operation. They would have not released that info if they planned on arresting more people, because they know that people would get rid of any incriminating evidence. They don&#039;t have time to go after every buyer on the site and they know it. However, to be on the safe side in case agents do come knocking on your door any time soon, you need to wipe your computer. Have no record of Tor anywhere on it. If you still want to use the Silk Road, have a friend let you use his laptop. And obviously clear your house of any and all drugs and/or drug paraphernalia. Even though I doubt any law enforcement is going to pay you a visit, rid yourself of all evidence tied to you. As of now, it&#039;s just circumstantial evidence. You could technically make the claim that someone shipped something to your house as a cruel joke. If the package does show up, you throw it away somewhere that is nowhere near your house. I suggest driving at least an hour in one direction and throwing the whole package in a giant dumpster, although I doubt it will arrive at this point. Take a friend&#039;s car to that location and wear a hoodie that covers most of your face. The important thing is to cover your trail everywhere you go. I hate to say it, but you may want to destory your computer entirely and take every piece and do the same thing I suggested with the package. Take the pieces somewhere far, far away in a vehicle that has nothing to do with you and throw them away. Burn them if possible. Clear yourself of any and all evidence. <br /><br />Good luck. I truly wish you the best.
