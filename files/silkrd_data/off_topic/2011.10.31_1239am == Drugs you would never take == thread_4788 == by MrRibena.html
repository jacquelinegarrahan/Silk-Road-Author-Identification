				Potentially a stupid question for the SR crowd but do you have any?<br /><br />For me, meth and heroin. Just not my cup of tea. I&#039;ve seen the affects of addiction so I&#039;m not even going to try it.

				i think i missed my youthfull chance at angel dust pcp<br /><br />I really couldnt see myself getting all fucked up on pcp in my today, all the other mainline drugs like heroin,meth, lsd, I would do but dont activly seek them out, shrooms are really fun and giggly, DMT should be mandatory for the drug adventurist to take <br /><br />Ive been looking for a good upper, taken adderall a bit, but that feeling of super charged sometimes comes hand in hand with the tweeker self<br />Never tried opium, Id really like some

				Inhalants other than nitrous and maybe ether. Some guy I was hanging out with was huffing glade or something similar. I tried a hit but the taste made me nauseous. <br /><br />At a party some guy was huffing nitrous on steps, passed out, fell, and cracked his head on the floor at the bottom.

				I would never try heroin or smoke crack cocaine. I sometimes think about trying crack cocaine or feel like I want to try it, but I know I cannot afford to become addicted to something so expensive. I have no desire to ever try heroin and I wouldn&#039;t think twice about saying &quot;no&quot; if it were offered to me.<br /><br />These two are the only drugs I have actually done enough research on to decide I would distance myself from them. There are probably other drugs I would not try, but I don&#039;t know enough about other drugs to know which ones. Psychedelics and dissociatives are 2 kinds of drugs I try to stay away from and know little about, and I&#039;d say if I were offered a drug like those, I would say no. I don&#039;t like to be out of my head at all, I am terrified by the thought of not being able to control or remember what I do or say.<br /><br />I am also not interested in trying any of the cheap, grocery store methods of getting high. By this I mean huffing paint or air duster, things like that. I honestly just do not think it&#039;s very safe, nor am I that desperate to get high.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone who uses any of the drugs I&#039;ve listed, I have no reservations whatsoever about anyone who uses ANYTHING. I don&#039;t judge others in hopes that I will not be judged by others.<br /><br /><br />&lt;3

				I doubt I&#039;ll ever try crack, and stuff like sniffing paint or other legal (but dangerous) methods of getting high when there are dozens of better ways. Other than that, pretty much everything&#039;s fair game.<br /><br />I do heroin on occasion, maybe once or twice a month. It&#039;s just too expensive and risky to make a habit out of it. I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t have a compulsion for it.

				Heroin is just a no go. Physical addiction to a drug and experiencing physical pain when not on it just seems plain horrible. I also can&#039;t really imagine taking real heavy sedatives like Propofol for fun.<br /><br />Crack cocaine also is a no go and smoking cocaine too. <br /><br />Amphetamines have a too rough edge for me. I could take the hangover when I was 17 but&nbsp; I&#039;d like to be normal when it&#039;s monday again ;-) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I would never touch heroin. THe physical withdrawals and such kind of scare me as well. I have tried meth and won&#039;t do that again either. I just felt twitchy and wired but not pleasant at all. I like sleep too much I think. Things like bath salts and jimson weed etc also are off limits I think. There are better drugs that are actually intended to be ingested by humans lol. There are worse things about a drug than it being illegal.

				From erowid<br /><br />Addiction Potential #<br />MDMA has the potential to be psychologically addicting. Individuals who use it regularly may find they have an increased desire to continue using it. There is a short period of tolerance after MDMA use.

				Heroin, Meth and Crack are bad news imo, seen a lot of victims of addiction. No doubt they&#039;re great fun but physically they&#039;ll ruin you<br /><br />MDMA is not addictive. It may be psychologically addictive but anything is if you like it enough and works in the context which you use it (and have an addictive personality)<br /><br />Coke was good fun but I HAD to have it every weekend. I would literally count down from monday 8am to the weekend when I could have some. Didn&#039;t help my gf like it and we&#039;d have marathon sex session under the influence. Great tho it was it nearly took over and we stopped just in time and now don&#039;t think about it.<br />Mephedrone (4-MMC) was a close one too. Luckily the smell it left in my nose the day after put me off enough to not bother anymore.<br /><br />I have MXE and have taken it in veeeery small doses, ie not much above threshold. Got no Ket experience so am venturing gently as I&#039;ve read too many reports of people going a little crazy on this shit (but equally read many of having a fantastic time).

				I&#039;d like to try diamorphine, but I would never take street heroin. You just can&#039;t be sure how it&#039;s been cut - and with what.<br /><br />I tried coke once but it was so cut that it wasn&#039;t worth the $50. I have no desire to try it again but I don&#039;t think I got the full effects of it.<br /><br />PCP gets a bad name because of its potential. There aren&#039;t many recorded cases of violence but when they do occur it&#039;s serious shit! If I were to ever try it I&#039;d only take a threshold dose.<br /><br />Not much of an interest in meth either.

				For recreational purposes I like to stick with the organics, weed and shrooms. I have a very addictive personality so I can&#039;t really trust myself to take and like anything that could could be addicting. I have much respect for people that can use things like coke, heroin, and meth responsibly because lord knows I wouldn&#039;t be able to!

				ill give most things a try with a few exceptions, those being ibogaine, 3 solid days of tripping just seems like a bit too much, im not sure im up for something of that duration, but you never know that one may change. other than that i dont and wont inject anything and that one isnt changing, oh and ill be steering clear of delieriants like datura too, other than that i think im game to try most things once at least.<br /><br />oh and i wouldnt steer clear of it, but i hope i never need viagra either! :P

				There isn&#039;t much on this list. I&#039;ve had a few periods in the past of addiction so I try to stay away from Coke and Meth. I can&#039;t say I&#039;ll never do them again though just generally avoid. I&#039;ve already done most everything but a few I haven&#039;t I will not try in the future. Those being; banging heroin, smoking crack, PCP, and inhalants of any ilk. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried 2ce and will never do that again. I will not try a DOx substance despite my affinity for psychedelics. I also try to stay away from rx drugs. <br /><br />These days I stick to weed, lsd, mdma and/or shrooms.

You may find a compulsion for it if you love it too much, but you can&#039;t get &quot;hooked&quot; on it.<br /><br />My advice would be to order one bean from someone on here, try it, and if you love it, wait a week or two and order another. Don&#039;t order a gram of MDMA, as you may find yourself using it every day, which is terribly unhealthy.<br /><br />It&#039;s a super fun drug, but use it only on special occasions.

				@PFB - Don&#039;t worry about getting hooked on MDMA. It is a wicked fun drug (one of my favorites) and has no capacity for physical addiction. It does deplete your serotonin levels in the brain for a while but it does rebuild over time. Just don&#039;t do it more than once a month or longer and you will be fine. If you do it more than that you won&#039;t get the full benefit from it anyway. People that are &#039;addicted&#039; to it are chasing the first roll without giving their brains enough time to recharge. But seriously, E is probably the best and most fun drug I have ever taken.

				There isnt many things i would say no to, probably stimulants with the exception of coke and 4-mmc.<br />I want to give most things a go, even the ones drug users fall for propaganda about them like datura, pcp and heroin.<br />I would even take bzp/tfmpp, just to see what its like and to be able to say ive had it before.

I was still able to function fully without it and I merely looked forward to it A LOT. That&#039;s very different to needing a hit just to get out of bed, body crippling constipation and redosing despite severe health complications etc. Wouldn&#039;t you agree?<br /><br />Also crack is more addictive than powder coke. Fact. <br /><br />It is, like you say, freebase but because it&#039;s smoked it enters the blood stream far quicker than when snorted. Smoking is second in speed of delivery to the brain only to injection. The increased rate of absorption produces a different &#039;hit&#039; than slower absorbed powder coke. While the high might be similar, the increased rate of absorption causes the release of neurotransmitters quicker relative to powder coke which in turn leads to their (and the high&#039;s) depletion at a quicker rate resulting in more frequent administering of the drug which as we all know, is part of the root of addiction. Also, the freebase is less water soluble which means it crosses the blood brain barrier easier resulting in more of what&#039;s already been said. Read the literature before making wild accusations my friend.<br /><br />MrDdroMcGillacutty posted this <br /><br />&quot;Anything that has been made in a bathtub or made out of or with household chemicals. No thanks&quot;<br /><br />While some syntheses are indeed just dirty and toxic, many are legitimate and exactly as would be carried out in industry. People often say, &quot;it&#039;s made with drain declogger, f**k that!&quot;. Truth is it&#039;s just sodium hydroxide, a pH raising agent and exactly the same chemical as would be used to formulate say, paracetamol or ibuprofen in industry. This can be said of many chemicals used to make drugs. Strange concept to understand but that&#039;s why chemistry is amazing, it can make amazing products out of what were once toxic compounds.

I mean, it IS the drug that makes you addicted, but I know for a fact smoking meth makes you &quot;more addicted&quot; i guess than if you were to always snort it.<br />I can only imagine that Crack and Coke work in the same way, Crack is more addictive just because smoking it is more addictive and you can&#039;t smoke Coke.
