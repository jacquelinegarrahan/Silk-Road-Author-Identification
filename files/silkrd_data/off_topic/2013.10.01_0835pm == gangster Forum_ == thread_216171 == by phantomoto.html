				Im sure there was something like this about but now there looking at 4 brick walls, people that call them self&#039;s gangsters and all that bollox are only fools to be honest acting big showing off money guns and drugs bringing the fucking heat on...<br /><br />I know top drug lords that are posh and you would not think anything of them that&#039;s how you want to be if your making money keep your big mouth shut so you stay in the game and not behind bars just my 2cents

				I have been interested this type of things as well because of my writing hobby. I have never done any major crimes in my life, but this type of forums could provide real information about many things. And real criminal stories with realism are very inspiring. Different stories of different lives - people are interesting. There has been something in here Silk Road Forums as well.
