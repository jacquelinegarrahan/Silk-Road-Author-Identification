				i&#039;m wondering how much impact SR has to do with the price of bitcoins, and as vendors, if we would all decide to hold all our coins for a couple/few weeks just to see what would happen to the value of the coin.&nbsp; &nbsp;how many vendors out there would be willing to do this? perhaps we could drive up the value of the market and increase our profits. . . just a thought.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d love to inflate the value. I am sitting on 400 coins at the moment with homes that the value spikes :) .<br /><br />An increase in price from $5.00 to $7.00 could make me almost $10,000 richer :)

				i&#039;m on board.&nbsp; &nbsp;the trick is going to be for us vendors not to dump our coins all at once at the end of this 2 weeks, or else it will defeat the purpose because the market will crash.&nbsp; &nbsp;we need some sort of vendors union for something like this to actually work.

				Don&#039;t forget that you&#039;ve also got that recent BTC theft to contend with.&nbsp; Somebody out there has 43000 (I think that&#039;s what it was) BTC that they&#039;re going to need/want to get rid of - so if you guys actually manage to do this and have any kind of measurable impact on the exchange rate, you might end up getting undercut by an uncontrollable rogue element.&nbsp; Just a thought.&nbsp; Market manipulation tends to be a lot harder than it looks.

				Weekly volume must be in the dozen of millions. SR is a tiny fraction compared to the whole BTC economy. SR vendors holding coins for 2 weeks won&#039;t do any difference.<br /><br />The price goes down when the confidence falls. When Tradehill closed, many people didn&#039;t knew if the same might happen to other exchangers. The Bitcoinica case is something similar. People don&#039;t know what might happen and the price becomes volatile. What IF Bitcoinica had to close because of the theft?

				Isn&#039;t one of the reasons we use BTC to push ourselves further from a centralized/controlled currency and the corrupt people who control it?&nbsp; With you holding onto funds to push your profit margin higher while making the people with less bitcoins and the people who are buying bitcoins for products poorer and their bitcoins less valuable if they don&#039;t spend them immediately.&nbsp; What a couple thousand+/- instantly hitting the market would do would be another crash in price from 5~USD/BTC to about 2-3.&nbsp; You are what is wrong with the world be happy you have the money.&nbsp; Don&#039;t try to control the environment and make it shitty for other people just so you can momentarily gain maybe 3k extra.

				This won&#039;t work, and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />True, if you stop selling BTC now, you will create a shortage, which will drive up the price (in theory, anyway). But what happens 2 weeks from now, when the hoarding stops? All the sellers suddenly unloading 2 weeks worth of stored up BTC will create an OVERSUPPLY of BTC, which will drive DOWN the price of BTC BELOW what it was before the hoarding started. This is because the supply/demand ratio will be higher, because there will be a 2-week backlog worth of BTC that sellers will be unloading IN ADDITION to the BTC they will start selling again due to normal business activity.<br /><br />Manipulating markets like this is always a zero-sum game; the only way one person can gain money from this, is if other people lose money.

				mt.gox alone trades on average 100 000 BTC pr day.<br />Thats 1,4million coins in 14 days..<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any references on how big SR is, but I assume you would have to save quite a few bitcoins in order to have an impact.

				I first heard of BTC (and SR) at an occupy protest, some nut was spouting off to an economics student about how every one should switch to BTC because - in his words - it&#039;s not fiat money, it doesn&#039;t support bail outs and it&#039;s the future. <br /><br />I think there is something kind neat about BTC&#039;s potential for masking transactions but it&#039;s no where near said nut&#039;s fantasy.&nbsp; Any currency, any medium of exchange has to exist in the real world and so it will be subject to myriad pressures from financial institutions.&nbsp; BTC, while it remains legal, is of small enough trade volume that it offers great opportunity for market manipulation, hi/lo spreads are quite significant with BTC, for sure some one is making money though provision of liquidity in the market and nothing else.&nbsp; <br /><br />Reich: As a soon to be vendor I have to be honest and say that to some degree I am unnerved by how fragile BTC seems to be, but at the same time I am enthused that financial services are popping up around it, there are some smart hackers here on SR and Tor, I wonder if anyone has started to do the work of quants on their own, using statistical models to write automated trading programs, one could make a lot of money doing so but the risks from market moving events that are not quantifiable within said models is probably so high that you&#039;d have to be mad to stake your life savings on it.
