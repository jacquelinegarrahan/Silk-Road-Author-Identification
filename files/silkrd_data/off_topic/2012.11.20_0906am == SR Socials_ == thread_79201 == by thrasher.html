				I know this probably isn&#039;t a popular idea, due to the preference for anonymity and fear of honeypots, but has the idea of meeting up and getting high together ever been considered?&nbsp; I think we represent a pretty distinct community of awesome people, and this could be fun if there was a practical way to accomplish it.&nbsp; I&#039;m most just spitballing here, but in an ideal world and all...

				Could also be that I should stop posting when I&#039;m really high.

				Tomorrowland is a festival in Belgium.&nbsp; <br /><br />In an ideal world I would love to meet up. Always having friends to hook up with. Always a tripsitter available. People watching over each other Sharing the experience together.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />On festivals we will meet each other, but won&#039;t even know. Just look out for one another and make new friends! <br /><br />(Wow this whole post is a bit rainbow cakes in La La Land, but that is okay, right?)<br />

				It won&#039;t be a good idea as some established users here are infiltrated LE. I&#039;m not paranoid but that&#039;s the standard procedure of any LE operation so if you think about it for 2 minutes you end up coming to my conclusion. Yes, I would like it as well but it&#039;s not possible...One option would be to gather in one place without knowing who is who but there is a big chance that some of the people coming there would be followed by LE assuming they are Vendors here. For example lime it&#039;s cocky and confident I would probably be able to tell who&#039;s lime from a group of people because I&#039;ve seen him answering to people and based on his posts I think it won&#039;t be that difficult to tell. <br /><br />Conclusion? Not a good idea unless they legalize all the drugs.
