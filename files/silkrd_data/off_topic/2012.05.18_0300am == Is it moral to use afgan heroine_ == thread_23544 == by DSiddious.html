				Knowing that it funds the Taliban, is it right to use afghan products. Or is it a case of don&#039;t give a shit where it comes from as long as it is there. Its funny people call for legalization and yet output from Afghanistan has gone up by 70% since we went in. So in some way the governments (US&amp;UK) is helping the flow. Who&#039;s to say they don&#039;t line their pockets along the way. Making money on the blood of our boys, I&#039;d like to know if it would put anybody off buying afghan if they really knew what they were buying.

The opium fields being burnt by the previous Afghan regime is one of the leading causes for the war. About 90% of America&#039;s heroin comes from there.

				ALSO. What part does morality play into a heroin user?<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;d rather shoot-up with heroin not cultivated in Afghani lands.&quot; <br /><br />Isn&#039;t the whole point just to get high? Either way you&#039;re funding some sort of drug cartel or massive heroin business; keeping thousands upon thousands of people involved in labor and covert operations. By all means, just shoot up man, you&#039;re still fucking people over in the end.

				I don&#039;t use opy&#039;s btw. But knowing that it does fund the Taliban does kind of swing me toward the view that people should not take heroine. I knew there would be a crime ring I&#039;m not that stupid but one that is fighting and killing our troops? Its weird fighting the Taliban and then at the same time funding them.&nbsp;

				Who gives a fuck if it funds terrorists the only reason you can&#039;t buy pure heroin from Smack-Mart is because of governments war on drugs, they fund terrorism you just use heroin.

				Let&#039;s just cut to the root of the morality issue. Governments war on drugs results in heroin being used to fund terrorism. Governments war on drugs results in money spent on MDMA going to people involved in human trafficking and other fucked up shit. The moral of the story is that it is immoral to support the government so stop paying taxes to them.

				As far as the troops are concerned: Fuck those ignorant tools of Corporatocracy. Their participation just fuels the system fucking humanity into depravity. Appreciate the thought of empathy though! Is it fair that their ignorance lets them fight for causes far beyond their comprehension? In the grand scheme of things no but that&#039;s what happens when you never question anything your government might do. That&#039;s what happens when you&#039;re a conditioned nationalist the second you&#039;re born; for example, reciting a pledge affirming your allegiance to the state, daily.

				US troops are guarding Afghani opium fields (or used to be at least.. google that shit) because if they were to destroy the opium, they would lose the locals&#039; support as it is their main source of income.

I think the evidence is very strong that it has. But I also think that&#039;s more to do with either rogue CIA officers or CIA as a rogue agency with too much power from being able to operate in the shadows than any implication of overall US policy on the matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				why would you think the heroin helps the taliban? the taliban banned heroin production in 2000 when it was in power, it wasnt until the us invaded again that it started, the taliban hated heroin and gave severe punishments to anyone growing poppies. <br /><br />The heroin in afghanistan is controlled by several very powerfull warlords who i&#039;m sure dont give a fuck about the taliban, they just want the money and more then likely are allies against the taliban since the taliban banned opium production they essentially fucked over the warlords why do you think so many warlords helped the USA when they invaded, opium production<br /><br />when the taliban banned opium production it dropped 91% after the invasion production went from 7000 hectares to 193000 hectares. <br /><br />anyway i&#039;m pretty sure a large amount of american heroin comes from south america now and tar obviously from mexico, afghanistan stuff is mostly turned into heroin 3# for european use.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />do alittle googling you will find out its quite interesting, heres a link&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.nowpublic.com/world/after-us-invasion-afghanistan-now-produces-93-worlds-opium

				According to something I saw on NatGeo:<br /><br />The poppys are just harvested for their opium. It is then sent off to Iran for production into Heroin. And it was said that Iran has the worlds highest heroin addiction rate. Then it makes its way to Europe.<br /><br />Anyway, of all the money that is spent on the end product, a very insignificant percentage gets back to the religious &quot;terrorists&quot;, the other group which has acquired the terrorist lablel are just some form of international drug smuggling syndicates, more likely interested in profits than ideology. <br /><br />Just know that what you spend on it don&#039;t amount to a fart in a tornado.

				If you believe all the propaganda behind heroin and the Taliban then don&#039;t buy the stuff, buy some china white instead..........<br /><br />But really if you have issues buying a product because it was produced by terrorists then make sure to double check the producers of some big super market brands, high street fashion labels and general house hold names.

				I remember reading some where when the US was occupying Afghanistan and all that shit, Donald Rumsfeld supported one of the biggest poppy growers in the region, because they were an enemy of the Taliban, who were for limiting the number of poppy fields. <br /><br /><br />The US government is full of shiiiiit. <br /><br />What blows me away though, is that its common knowledge our government is full of shit, yet what do we do about it?

				I&#039;ve not read the replies so this may have been covered:<br /><br />But every time you pretty much anything (except drugs). Whatever country you&#039;re in taxes you on that purchase. These taxes are spent on many things. But one of them is their &#039;defense&#039; budget. The weird thing about governments is they have no idea that &#039;defense&#039; and &#039;offense&#039; are different things. <br /><br />We&#039;ve all funded the creation and maintenance of nuclear weapons. Our elders have funded their research and invention. Every bad thing in the world today is made possible because of governmental tax and research. <br /><br />And if you believe the tin hatters, the afghan heroin industry is CIA controlled anyway. So if anything, you&#039;re funding a local farmer in afghan, and America. <br /><br />If the ethical consequences are your main worry whilst mainlining heroine, you need to stop being a hippy.

They end up voting to remove property from their neighbors, and spread it amongst themselves. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />FYI, this country was not just founded on democratic principles but also built on CAPITALISM. So please do cite some examples in a capitalist society that practices representative democracy like ours where voters have taken property away from their neighbors in order to spread it among themselves. And no, I don&#039;t consider cases of eminent domain to be relevant since that serves the public utility (not the same as financial situation) and the owner is fairly compensated, neither of which you mentioned.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In the beginning of this country, we chose the property owner status because they had some skin in the game, and two, they were more successful people, and therefore typically more intelligent and paid closer attention to whats going on politically.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In the beginning of this country, minorities weren&#039;t even allowed to own property. A woman lost any right to control property that was hers prior to marriage, nor did she have rights to acquire any property during marriage. So first, I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;skin in the game&quot;. Were these white landowning elite more invested in the country than the landless laborers and minorities that worked backbreaking hours in virtual slave labor that had nowhere else to go? It seems like the landowners were the ones with the resources to make real choices on whether to leave the country should things get bad and the slave laborers had a ton more &quot;skin in the game&quot; since they didn&#039;t have any options and were stuck here. <br /><br />And of course the male, white landowning elite were more successful and intelligent because they could vote to have their interests represented and ensure anyone with competing interests stay disenfranchised. They also had far more incentive to pay attention politically because only they were allowed to vote, so no surprise that they did while it&#039;s much harder to pay attention when you&#039;re just struggling to survive. What you just described is known as elitism. Was that your point?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Greeks actually considered democracy a bad form of government, it is taking republican government to the extreme (notice the lack of big &quot;R or D&quot;) in a bad way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When it first evolved, yes, it was considered a bad idea. But over time it came to be considered one of three good forms of government (along with monarchy and aristocracy) as opposed to the three bad forms of tyranny, oligarchy, and ochlocracy.<br /><br />But regardless, ancient Greeks also practiced slavery so what&#039;s your point? Are you suggesting Ancient Greece be held up as the apex of civilization that modern societies should aspire? Or is this your not so subtle way of playing apologist for elitism and suggesting we transition to aristocracy? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As someone once said, and to sum up my point: &quot;Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what is for dinner.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not sure I agree with that description but I&#039;m getting the distinct impression that your ideal form of government involves two wolves and many sheep with only the two wolves getting to decide what to eat for dinner and you being one of the wolves.

				the taliban may charge tax but the northern alliance have always been much bigger players in the h market and u guessed it there are friends<br /><br />afghan no4 was pretty much un heard of wasnt it(not 100% sure)before the invasion .it was for no3 and since the invasion production went up big time yet all europes no3 is shit and uk stuff can only be classed as fake now which is wierd <br /><br />i think afghan makes a lot of no4 now and most of the stuff here is all afghan so i reckon the afghans have started doing much more for usa market which really isnt a suprise or coincidence it was always gonna happen when they invaded,the usa&nbsp; probably taught the druglords how to do the extra production steps so it was suitable for there market

				Its imposable to spend money without in eventually passing through some unethical people or business. I gave up worrying a long time ago. Pay your taxes - some money may go to fund a war, give to charity - some could go to corrupt third world officials, buy heroin - some may go towards funding the next terrorist plot, even buy something from your local shop - maybe the shop owner will spend it on child porn.<br />It&#039;s all connected in thousands of ways, one giant pool were all swimming in.

				HEY!

He only took up Heroin to support the Chinese farmers (who work dam hard by the way). John is thinking of investing in Columbia and becoming a coke head too. In fact he does alot to support fledgling economies in far flung corners of the globe! John the Junky is all about the fair trade movement.<br />Support a foreign farmer, take drugs! Remember, it&#039;s all tax free, so at least we&#039;re not supporting any wars ect.<br />I shouldn&#039;t write this shit late at night after taking some R and R!

				Very few people in real life give a shit about trading ethics. They SAY they do, but when you as the to pay EXTRA for ethically sourced produce, all for a sudden ethics is out the window for shire economic market forces. This is true in all areas of product supply in a &#039;free&#039; market. Do you want these ethically sourced paving stones at THREE times the price of the &#039;un&#039;ethically sourced ones which are sometimes a superior product? Nine times out of ten people are not willing to pay for it when it comes down to it. Sad, but understandable.<br /><br />And I know that a Heroin user can feel completely ostracized from their community. Dirty looks everywhere, no one willing to give you a chance. People openly stating (family members included) that the world would be a better place without you. The lowest of the low in societies eyes.<br />This all generates a &#039;Fuck You&#039; attitude within the addict as he/she starts to slowly believe in their own worthlessness. You tell someone they are a piece of shit often enough and for long enough and they will start to believe it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s right, but, how can you expect someone who doesn&#039;t care about themselves to care if it is moral to use afghan heroin?&nbsp; &nbsp;
