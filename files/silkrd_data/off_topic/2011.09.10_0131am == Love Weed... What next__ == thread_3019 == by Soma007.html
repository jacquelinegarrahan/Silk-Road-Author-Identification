				Don&#039;t try a damn thing until you&#039;ve researched the effects and are 100% comfortable with it. If you love weed but don&#039;t have any idea of another drug you want to take then I&#039;d suggest not trying another one until you figure it out yourself. :)

				Thanks for all of the input guys!&nbsp; Appreciate the advise....<br /><br />I agree with what is said about needing to realize what experience I am looking for....&nbsp; <br /><br />I think generally what sounds interesting to me is something to zone out.... (nothing uptown.... downtown is kinda what I am going for....&nbsp; <br /><br />Also the shrooms or acid is something I have been wanting to try for a long time...&nbsp; what is the basic difference with the two?&nbsp; What is the advantage of one over the other?<br /><br />Later!<br />Soma

				actually the more i try it the more i think 2c-b would be&nbsp; a fantastic introduction to the world of psychs, its not as serious or deep as acid or shrooms. on the subject of the difference between the two for me at least ive found acid is a lot more visual and also prone to ego death and more profound thoughts than on shrooms, your first experience of which will no doubt be spent almost entirely laughing your arse off for no good reason, youll stop laughing, then youll look at a can of beans or something and itll make you crack up laughing like a fool again. this is of course dose and strain dependant, there are shroom experiences out there that can easily rival the most powerful of any other psychedelic, they are not to be underestimated as a &quot;hallucinogen-lite&quot; if you will. and again experiences differ from person to person but i find shrooms are a fun social thing, great with lots of friends about, where as with an acid trip im rather selfish and like to trip alone away from others, but those are personal things you will learn with experience<br /><br />for the rest it sounds like the downers are for you, may i recommended to a fellow weed lover the excellent combo of a 2mg clonazepam and a spliff its lovely, maybe explore other benzos too. further than that and as long as you have the will power required to not get addicted then you have the opiates too, its not as big and bad as people make out though, ive personally tried raw opium, morphine, oxycodone, codeine and DHC with no feeling of need to go back to them, in fact in many cases once i felt id got what i wanted out of them i passed them on to friends who were also interested (i seem to do that so much, i buy 10 tabs but somehow i end up only eating 2 and never remember where the rest go i think people have just realised they just need to be around me to get wrecked!) <br /><br />and please if you are interested in psychedelics do not rule out DMT yes it is a powerful, powerful substance and that scares many away but it can be so awe inspiringly beautiful that there simply arent words to do it justice, it may be one better saved for a little later in your journey when youre a little more experienced but keep it in mind as it really is very very special<br /><br />so in short get out there and read, find out what sounds like the sort of thing youd like, sites like erowid and bluelight are packed with wonderful information, god how i wished i could have been in your situation, coming here then being confronted by all these wonderful new chems, all that choice for the first time out of nowhere, for me it was years spent reading about others experiencing them thinking that id never get the chance to even meet a person who had actually tried a chemical like say 2c-e, my list was a mighty long one even before i started smoking weed some 15 odd years ago, now im sat here with some of these chems i almost grew up dreaming about by my side as i type this and 2cb running through my brain right now, its amazing how things can change when you least expect it<br /><br />also as you mention a penchant for zoning out have you considered the dissociatives like ket, mxe and dxm, they may be right up your alley, relaxed, mongy and hallucinatory too but some people arent comfortable with the total dissociation of a k-hole type experience just as there are those uncomfortable with an ego death experience with lsd

				Mushrooms are pretty mild. I wouldn&#039;t start with LSD, but I do like the 2C-B suggestion. A psychedelic seems like your best route.

				Sporeworks and the hawk&#039;s eye are both reputable spore vendors. I have used both and had good results. Just depends on what strain you want. Both have a decent selection also but there are a few strains that only one or the other have in stock. They have good tutorials on growing listed at http://www.shroomery.org/forums. Just search for &#039;PF Tek&#039;

				You could try Lyrica (Pregabalin). It&#039;s a neuropathic pain medication for people with MS and Fibromyalgia, and has a high similar to being both stoned and shitfaced. It&#039;s a mellow, couchlock-y high that potentiates opiates and marijuana very well. Lyrica is one of my favorite drugs, I take a few of them every morning and I&#039;m baked all day. The high just lasts and lasts. You should check &#039;em out, see what Bluelight and Erowid have to say about it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested, I have a listing for them on my SR account.

In this case try MDMA, then shrooms, then acid, and only then should you try candyflip (lsd+MDMA) and hippyflip (shrooms+MDMA).<br />I&#039;d leave dissociatives for later (ketamine, dxm), they are pretty hardcore (the trip itself is TOTALLY different to an acid trip for instance) and i don&#039;t enjoy the body load after you land back on Earth.
