				The two big ones are Mt. Gox and Tradehill, each seem to have their casual users and their fanatics. I personally have never had an issue with Gox but they&#039;re also the only ones I&#039;ve used

				I always considered MtGox as the de-facto standard, and planned to do business with them until I tried to do business with them. I sent a Dwolla payment to them and, after waiting 3-4 times what they quote for Dwolla to go through, still didn&#039;t see money in my account. Contacted their support (very quick to respond) and was told that the payment &quot;wasn&#039;t in their account&quot; even though I used their link to send the money to them. They told me to call Dwolla and request my money back, which I did. Dwolla was very helpful, but told me that the payment was definitely in their account and that if they didn&#039;t see it then they should be the ones calling them.<br /><br />After relaying this message and a few words to nudge them in the proper direction, they &quot;magically&quot; found my payment and credited my account. At this point all my faith was lost in them, so I quickly transferred my money to TradeHill and had a perfect experience there.<br /><br />My experience is not the standard with MtGox, but I&#039;ve heard a good amount of negative reviews while I waited for my money. I, personally, will not be doing business with them again.
