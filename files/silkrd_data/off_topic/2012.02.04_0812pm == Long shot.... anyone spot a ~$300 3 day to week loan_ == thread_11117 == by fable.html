				Heya, I&#039;m a vendor on SR if ya didn&#039;t know.&nbsp; I want to purchase some acid from Familyforever during the Customer Appreciation sale but am a little over $300 short.&nbsp; I have $866 in escrow right now with all the packages boxed up and ready to go out the door Monday morning.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have your money back with interest before the week is out.&nbsp; Lol, I know no one is probably gonna go for this but it&#039;s worth a shot, right?&nbsp; :P

				Yeah.&nbsp; I have no incentive to scam anyone now.&nbsp; Right now I&#039;m selling just trying to get back to where I started money-wise, and I will have to sell for at least another week or two to get there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can&#039;t scam anyone now and jeopardize the possibility of making all my money back.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wanna get some cheap acid while the sale is hot!&nbsp; &nbsp;8) <br />-fable(d)

				Ok, so here&#039;s the deal:<br /><br />$350 in however much BTC that is at the time, on 10% interest if paid back within the week.&nbsp; == $385 in BTC paid back!<br /><br />If it takes me longer than 1 week to get your money back for any reason, I&#039;ll pay you back $420 (20% interest).<br /><br />For those of you who do not know, my account name on SR is fabled.<br /><br />-fable(d)
