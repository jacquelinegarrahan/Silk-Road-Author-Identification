				The guide I have says like this.<br /><br />Step one: Don&#039;t think about it.<br />Step two: Don&#039;t try it.<br />Step three: Enjoy the fact that this guide saved your life.<br /><br />The thing I want to say is that I am not against heroin users, but I would advise all my people to avoid trying.<br /><br />Take care.<br />|Adamiz

				I&#039;m curious. its a powder right? but you cant inject a powder. do you mix it with saline? does plane salt water work? or do you have to buy some sort of medical saline solution?
