				Hey Fellow Grower,<br /><br />Do you need investment/loan to expand your growing business?<br /><br />Maybe I can help you.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for experienced growers for a brand new darknet service. This service can help you get investment (in Bitcoin).<br /><br />This is a private beta test to validate the idea. So results are not guaranteed. We will launch in February.<br /><br />Most important:<br /><br />* you don&#039;t have to pay anything<br />* you can /and should/ stay anonymous<br /><br />However, this is not a magic button service. You have to put some extra work into it:<br /><br />* You need to make a business plan (2-3 page). (Scammers don&#039;t waste your time. It will be obvious for me if you are not an experienced grower.)<br />* You have to have a solid SR or SR forum history (or other evidence that you are a grower)<br /><br />EMail me for more details (with SR or SR forum profile link): cannabond@tormail.org (PGP: 0x60A82221)<br /><br />Please contact me only if you qualify.

				Christy, what makes you think the OP is a cop?&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t seem to be asking for any kind of personally-identifying info and in fact ENCOURAGES remaining anonymous.&nbsp; <br /><br />What are your thoughts, Christy?

				His intelligence may be up for debate, but still not sure that means he is a cop.<br /><br />Either way, regardless, it&#039;s awesome when members look out for the community, so +1 to you, Christy, for urging caution!
