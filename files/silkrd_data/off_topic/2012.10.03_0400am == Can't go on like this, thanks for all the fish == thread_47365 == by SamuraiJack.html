				Here to say goodbye. SR has been an incredible dream, and built on the goodwill of many men and women. We humans are capable of so much, but we&#039;ll never escape our dark side either. <br /><br />Medical Marijuana controls my depression, gives me some solace when it gets overwhelming. I always say it saved my life in the worst of it. <br /><br />A month ago I lost $200+ to MrYellow. It seems I just lost $400 to TorWallet when I transferred my coins to them as I have many times in previous months. I&#039;m broke now, with no prospects of not being broke. <br /><br />I was just trying to help. Two months in a new city unable to find a source, so I turned to SR and offered to share with some others who were also struggling. I always charged them only what I paid. <br /><br />Thank you to all the venders who do their work as a public service and with integrity, and to all the members who care about this community and look out for each other. The dark side wins though. They prey on the unsuspecting like a virus always evolving, taking advantage of the situation created by unjust laws. You can avoid them mostly, but the constant effort to protect yourself is exhausting and I just can&#039;t handle it anymore. What kind of life is this we&#039;re fighting for? One technically free from harm but constantly in fear of evil?<br /><br />To the criminals, the*true* criminals, I wish you cared you were hurting sick people, stealing medicine, and leeching off the misery of the desperate. I wish it was you who felt like this. <br /><br />So goodbye all, for those of you that fight on. I wish you health and happiness, what there is to be had. I&#039;m just..tired. <br /><br />- SJ<br />

				me and you both brother; I&#039;m on the next flight out this bitch. money is the solution for you; u are free since they have no idea of your existence; don&#039;t forget that freedom is worth money when it comes to plan b: SR has cheap deals one can double up quick on, or just be a consumer. best of luck dawg.
