				So, I searched around and saw no topics about this. Thought I&#039;d make a top 5, just wanted to see what everybody else enjoyed around the world. <br /><br />1. Great White Shark<br />2. Pink Kush<br />3. Purple Kush <br />4. Northern Lights<br />5. Blueberry<br /><br />Mmm just listing them makes me drool... ;D<br />I&#039;ve always wanted to try Blue Dream, which I&#039;m sure I will eventually. What y&#039;all smoking?

				As i&#039;m in the UK we rarely ever get &#039;specific&#039; weed strains.<br />But the first time i ever picked up and smoked, it was a strain called Cat Piss. To this day it has always been my favorite strain. Makes me feel beautifully euphoric. floored me the first time and just laid in bed with a smile on my face that didnt go away for 3hrs! Everrything was bright and felt amazing too.<br />Smells strong as shit! A gram stunk out my room, it has a very unique smell (like piss) ;).<br />Thankfully doesnt taste this way though!

				To me, the strain does not matter because it matter how the plant is grown.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can have White Widow grown badly and the good grown schwag seed bud will get me higher.<br /><br />So really if the plant is grown perfectly with love, That is my favorite.

				My buddy used to share his personal harvest of amazing trainwreck, and I had never seen anything like that since!&nbsp; Quit smoking a few years ago, but whenever he harvests I always get nostalgic when I smell his cured buds.&nbsp; :)
