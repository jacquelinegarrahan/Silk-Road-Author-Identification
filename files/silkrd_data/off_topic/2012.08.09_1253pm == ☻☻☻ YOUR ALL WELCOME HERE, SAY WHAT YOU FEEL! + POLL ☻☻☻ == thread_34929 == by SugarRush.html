				&nbsp; Well, I decided to delete my old account&#039;s password from my passwords file because I&#039;m just not the type to spend my time posting on an internet forum, but thinking back at what I was posting I realized I was too mean to tt, even if I was just good naturedly trolling along to amuse myself.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Now, the vast majority of people on these forums are like me, they clearly don&#039;t really give a fuck what anyone else says on these forums, and if one of those people were posting this type of stuff then it would be correct to label them as a troll or an idiot, I incorrectly judged tt based on those normal standards for forum members.<br /><br />&nbsp; Dropping my anonymous forum skeptical douche bag persona for a moment it is clear to me that tt is a psychological wreck with serious emotional issues probably stemming from some type of abandonment or abuse previously in her life, it is clearly displayed through most of her posts and how desperate she is for everyone here to like her, and that means we can&#039;t judge her by normal forum standards.<br /><br />&nbsp; So as a community of what are inevitably the best and brightest of society(drug users) I think we should empathize with tt and pity her rather than become disgusted with her.&nbsp; Indeed, if we can judge the morality of our actions for just a moment based on how much happiness or sadness it causes in others then I think that the fact that someone&#039;s feelings are so connected to whether she is liked in these forums gives the people who post here a unique opportunity for real positive karma.<br /><br />&nbsp; Not that karma actually exists or that morality is so simple, but anyway, I say we should decide to humor her posts good naturedly, realizing that, however silly it is, and despite our intentions which are mainly just to get a laugh, what we type is obviously badly hurting another human beings feelings.&nbsp; Anyway, sorry tt, I hope that some day you have the emotional strength to quit caring what others think of you.<br /><br />&nbsp; And yeah, I realize that all of that just sounds like overly sentimental bullshit but I&#039;m not posting it for the benefit of others, I won&#039;t be replying to any responses to it, I just felt like making this type of humble gesture for my own benefit.
