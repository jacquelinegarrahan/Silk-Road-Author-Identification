Yeah, fuck them<br /><br />Ltc may not ever reach anything close to the Btc record high right now ($266 still iirc), but to think they are going to stay at around $2.75 is a bit farfetched as well. The only thing that dictates the price of any crypto-currency is what you can spend them on. <br /><br />Why Ltc might not be accepted instead of Btc<br /><br />-volatility (seriously though, pot meet kettle IMO)<br /><br />-too many alt coins diverting funds away from Ltc investments<br /><br />it&#039;s the wild west people, Btc and Ltc are gonna meet up at the OK Corral eventually, the fight is just going to last longer than 30 seconds. Maybe like 30 weeks is a better timeframe<br />

				Investing a few hundred dollars now may end up turning into a few thousand a year or two from now. Might as well buy some up 8)

				Yes I&#039;m digging up an old thread.&nbsp; For anyone left in the gray area on this matter, here are a ton of valid points.&nbsp; Don&#039;t mind the OP, the last page shows a small hope for LTC&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Just thought that I would provide some more solid arguments after discovering the post from reading the DPR article in Forbes.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178754.msg1292959#msg1292959
