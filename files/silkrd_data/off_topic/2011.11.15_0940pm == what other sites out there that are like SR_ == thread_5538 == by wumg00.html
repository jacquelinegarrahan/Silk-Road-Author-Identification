				Im new to TOR and to SR and wanted to know where I can find more sites like this. I came across Black Market (http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/) which is also pretty good. Where can I find more of these kind of communities/sites? can someone recommend some? I am especially interested in finding places that sell other things that are not so easy to find at your local wallmart&nbsp; besides just drugs.<br />&nbsp;thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				I have searched around and really SR seems to be the largest most active on the net. It may not be the safest, but if you read the forums and use yer gut instict, you shouldn&#039;t get ripped off too bad. Stay in escrow. That is what makes SR number one.

				OVDB and SR are the only two public sites. The Farmer&#039;s Market is semi-public in the sense that many people know it exists, but they have a private section too and even try to keep their .onion URL on the downlow, though its popped up on the hidden wiki before (but be careful with that because many of the sites purporting to be TFM are just phishing schemes). The rest of the sites you read about are scams (onion weed shop, black market, MaxX Vendor, etc.)<br /><br />The rest are various private forum scenes. I&#039;m not a member of any of them, but I know they exist and several key vendors on SR and OVDB come from the private boards originally. So basically, for those of us not in the private scene, its best to stick to OVDB and SR. TFM is something you can get access to, but I&#039;ve only logged in a few times and found the prices weren&#039;t that great and I thought it was weird they accepted PayPal. With OVDB, be sure to buy from the screened section and read the threads carefully to see if a particular vendor&#039;s practices work for you. There&#039;s no escrow or resolution center on OVDB. :)
