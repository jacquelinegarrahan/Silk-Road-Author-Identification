Never tried them. <br /><br />Any recommendations from anyone else? Not bothered about LSD/Shrooms or anything like that, not my thing.

There&#039;s a guy selling 5ml vials, cheap as well. Take half of one of those.. and it sets you off nicely (it doesn&#039;t become the date rape drug til you take 1/1.5 of those vials).<br /><br />Xanax and diazepam are pretty much the same in terms of effects. I can&#039;t tell the difference anyway. <br /><br />You ever done any of the 2c family? Euphoric rush, beastly visuals, but non of the profundity/soul fuckery that you get with LSD/DMT etc. <br /><br />

I usually drop 200mg of MDMA cause I&#039;ve got tolerance. But 200mg of drNyxs shit fucked my shit down.. I couldn&#039;t see clear for half of the roll. Im at a loss as to how he can sell such good shit for such low prices. <br /><br />Anyway Lim what about some quaaludes? I&#039;ve never seen them on SR but if you can find them.. Apparently they are the SHIT, but hardly seen since the fucking 80s

And his price is about 7 btc for a gram. Ivory was the first guy I got MDMA from on SR and his stuff is the same as drNyx, both have pretty much the primo optimo shit.<br /><br />Qualuudes, &quot;disco biscuits&quot; were big in the gay/disco scene of the 80s. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re a junkie drug.. they&#039;re pretty much obsolete these days. I&#039;ve never seen/heard of anyone having them anymore. If you can get them there&#039;s a lot of people on the product request board who would appreciate it

				Main difference between valium and xanax is their strength. .5mg of xanax feels like about 10mg of valium for me. It also seems to act faster, but maybe that&#039;s just placebo. I can&#039;t really tell a difference between equivalent doses as far as how they feel.<br /><br />Also might not be your thing, but have you tried opium? Smoking some opium while coming down off MDMA feels amaziiiiing
