				pretty sure what you now have is an ipod touch, changing an imei number has been made intentionally very difficult, i know you could do it with the samsung d500 but that was the last phone i remember being able to swap out imei numbers. also be aware if you do find a way to make sure you swap in an imei from an iphone4s that is dead, if it shows up as anything else it its a big red flag to them that youve changed the imei and they will come down on you like a ton of bricks for doing it (if i remember correctly its 5 years in the big house for changing an imei here)<br /><br />the only thing i could think you could do is find a 4s that got a busted up screen or something and swap in the legit mainboard from that into the rest of the blocked one you have, that said often imei blocks dont cross countries so its possible you could sell it to someone abroad who may be able to use it
