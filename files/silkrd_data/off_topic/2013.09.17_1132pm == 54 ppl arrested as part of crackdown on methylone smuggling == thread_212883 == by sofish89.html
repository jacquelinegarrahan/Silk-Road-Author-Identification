				CLEARNET&nbsp; http://www.13wham.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/8-arrested-molly-drug-ring-5578.shtml<br /><br /><br />text: <br /><br />Rochester, N.Y. - Eight people from Rochester have been charged with conspiracy to import and sell the drug known as &quot;molly&quot;. Under arrest are: Joshua Buerman, 25, Michelle Hess, 21, Kevin Willard, 21, Andrew Bosch, 28, Madhu Ashok, 21, Lance Minielly, 23, Jesse James Macaveny, 20 and Rita Levy Panzica, 18. U.S. Attorney William Hochul announced at a news conference Monday morning that their arrests are part of an international drug ring. He called it one of the most successful international investigations. On Monday, 54 arrests were announced and investigators connected dots in 20 different states and a dozen countries. &quot;These synthetic drugs are deadly- particularly when mixed together,&quot; said U.S. Attorney William Hochul. &quot;Last year, we came before you to announce the threat from bath salts, this summer we were concerned and announced to the public about heroin-phentanol mixture. Methylone, or Molly as it is known, is just another particular substance our community needs to be aware of.&quot; Hochul said the drugs were made in China and imported. Investigators learned from an intercepted email that several methylone shipments were being sent to Rochester last month. The investigation began in the summer of 2012, and with federal wire-taps approved by judges, investigators tracked the activities of at least one known supplier in China. The eight arrests in the Rochester area appear to be linked to the documented contact that Joshua Buerman, 25, had with the known &quot;Target&quot; in China. The 74-page criminal complaint details dozens of individual transactions conducted via email, Western Union, and the United States Postal Service. In each case, an email dialogue appears to serve as the way Buerman or others &quot;place the order&quot; with follow-up instructions often including a &quot;tracking number&quot; to locate the shipment. The shipment was often sent to different addresses such as various homes or hotels in the Rochester area. Methylone or &quot;Molly&quot; has become an increasingly popular club drug causing users to experience feelings very similar to ecstasy. A Greece man, Jeffrey Russ, died from a fatal overdose at a New York City music festival recently. Authorities could not say for certain whether the dealings of any accused of crimes in this federal case had any connection or link to substances that contributed to Russ&#039; death. &quot;This was one of the rare occasions where we were able to infiltrate the head of the snake,&quot; said Brian Crowell, the Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Agency. &quot;This is an organization, we allege, that is buying these chemicals very cheaply out of China over the internet. $1200 per kilogram and the profit they make from selling those...kilos of methylone is $100,000 per kilo. &quot;We allege the members of this organization were transporting or manufacturing about two kilos of this per month which translates into $200,000 (worth of) pills on the street going to our kids. These pills are going to high school kids and college age kids they are being marketed as &#039;Molly&#039; or &#039;MDMA&#039;...it&#039;s a synthetic chemical that has no medical use at all. It&#039;s extremely dangerous.&quot; Federal authorities said that the risk in taking just one dose of these substances is simply not known to the many users and buyers of these drugs. With a profit-margin of $100-to-1 on each dollar invested, authorities believe the one sure way to stop these dealers is to educate the public and drive down &quot;demand&quot; for these drugs. &quot;This is very, very dangerous if you are on the road to overdose it&#039;s very hard to reverse in our (Emergency Rooms) because basically your blood is going to boil.&quot; Crowell said. &quot;If we can wake the kids up and be aware of this stuff, it really is a terrible way for them to die.&quot; &quot;It&#039;s really Russian Roulette. You may have gotten a good high five or six times but I&#039;m here to tell you it will only take one time to get a bad batch of this methylone and you&#039;ll end up in a hospital or worse yet in a morgue,&quot; said Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Gregory. &quot;This a very dangerous drug, Mollyand the related substance bath salts are very dangerous, you do not know what you&#039;re going to get. Your last hit, could be your last hit.&quot;<br /><br />Read More at: http://www.13wham.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/8-arrested-molly-drug-ring-5578.shtml

				Well intercepted emails couldve been the NSA finding the words &quot;methylone&quot; and &quot;kilogram&quot; and &quot;tracking number&quot; in their emails and then surveilling these poor kids..<br />What do u think?<br />Well their first mistake was ordering over the clearnet and also ordering directly from the manufacturer. I suppose that ordering from a middleman will reduce the chances of the DEA finding you thru the manufacturer

				This is why PGP encryption is so important.&nbsp; Without naming any names I know for a fact that another Chinese methylone vendor has been having major problems, seizures/interceptions and CDs for a couple of months now.&nbsp; I wonder if they are talking about his supplier?&nbsp; I already knew that one of the members of his operation was arrested at the very beginning of this year and there is an investigation going on and that law enforcement knew about their emails.&nbsp; I even posted about it on here once before.&nbsp; When will people learn....? :(<br /><br />If you are one of the many customers of that vendor who has been having all of the interceptions/seizures then I sure hope you burned that drop address.

I was lucky enough to live in EU for most of my life...actually got to meet the real miss molly. Sad, really. I know of a gentleman who ran a little operation during ultra down in miami that he somehow snuck in 30 kilos for, only two seizures. Same plaze ol&#039; gonzo gets em from. His pricing was 1600/kilo, and knocked them off at 8k a brick, but up to 12. That stuff breaks my heart :( Those kids shouldn&#039;t be getting such ready access to that garbage. I&#039;d put the estimates at 90% of molly in the streets is M1/other unless you live up towards canada/chicago.

				I&#039;m surprised I found a thread on this news finally here on SR forum.&nbsp; There seems to have been a shake down on the clear net world of vending RC&#039;s and other things.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve recently read that some kid got caught in R.I. USA selling acetyl-fentanyl.&nbsp; Which was being openly sold on a clearnet website.&nbsp; Also about the BMR guy selling guns and other goodies getting caught finally because his shipping methods sucked ass, though the articles say he managed to get guns into several countries including Aussie.&nbsp; The only thing I haven&#039;t been able to follow up on is the kid from South Carolina that got busted vending.&nbsp; Supposedly the feds had seized his bitcoins but no other news ever came about if he ever got prosecuted or what.&nbsp; Vendors on clearnet sites do suck when it comes to shipping methods.&nbsp; Everye RC i&#039;ve ever ordered usually comes in just a mylar bag, maybe a sheet describing what it is, and 90% of the time they are hand written addresses.&nbsp; Though they do arrive quicker than any order made on SR and are way cheaper.&nbsp; Hell a gram of 25B usually fetches for $60 vs. SR&#039;s over priced grams but I guess that&#039;s the going global rate.&nbsp; This includes the Foxy&#039;s and Moxy&#039;s which are also way expensive on SR.&nbsp; MXE is about the only thing were the price stays about the same as on a clearnet vendor site.&nbsp; I believe the South Eastern corridor is in the clear for now since the recent major bust South of Atlanta Georgia where this couple was caught w/ 22 kilo&#039;s of MDMA, apparently the investigation is still open, they were ordering it from Canada, supposedly they&#039;ve already picked up a couple of airport employee&#039;s that supposedly help facilitate it making it here so I don&#039;t think it was mail or SR related.&nbsp; 22 Kilos&#039; keeps the feddies satisfied for a few months though.&nbsp; Xmas time is going to be awesome though, think about it, drug sales are going to go through the roof, btc&#039;s will probably explode in value, I&#039;m trying to have a good new years eve this year, fully stocked and prepared to bring in 2014 w/ some LSD/DMT/Shrooms/Wax/MDMA/Super Dank AAA+++nugz and all kinds of goodies

				The documents on this case are very easily found on the interwebs. The full 74 pages are worth reading.<br /><br />In 7/2012, the agent learned that a different SA on another case had been investigating the Chinese lab, and&nbsp; happened to have a warrant for that lab&#039;s emails, dating back to 3/2012. The warrant had been issued in the Eastern District of Virginia. THe other case is not mentioned. The different SA agreed to pass on emails relating to the Fantasies case.<br /><br />The document does not say how they handled the &quot;several thousand&quot; other emails attached to that account. <br /><br />The &#039;live&#039; Alice email warrant was approximately 7/23/2013-8/22/2013, but they were reading mail for a very long time before that.&nbsp; Apparently cleartext email. Stored cleartext email in the lab&#039;s gmail account. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see the rationale for the &quot;live&quot; warrant beyond it provides a distraction, and makes them look as though they swooped in and cleaned stuff up over a month, rather than sitting back and letting large heaps of Deadly, Deadly Drugs That People Can&#039;t Be Trusted With come in over 18 months. <br />Maybe I&#039;m missing something though.<br />
