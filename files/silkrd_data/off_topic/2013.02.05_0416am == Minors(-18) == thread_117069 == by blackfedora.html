				Never really put much thought into this but how many minors do you estimate are activly buying drugs on Sr its quiet easy in retrospect ,especially with the anonimity aspect seeing how theres no age verify , and I also started wondering how do you think LE would charge a minor if caught with a package, could they easily say&#039; someone paid me to come pick it up&#039; and get away with it, if so many of us could use children to our benefit&nbsp;

				I guess another thing to consider is the darknet.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the darknet you can buy poisons, guns and child prostitutes.&nbsp; Disgusting illegal porn and more.&nbsp; Hitmen can be hired as well.<br /><br />I was checking out the gun dealer websites around the darknet and SR&#039;s armoury forum they had up.&nbsp; It was all teenagers trying to buy guns.&nbsp; All of them.&nbsp; They were so desperate for a gun they would send money first without escrow, and anything to get a gun.&nbsp; They were getting scammed left and right. . it was all scams.&nbsp; There was like nobody really selling guns, just people scamming these poor teenagers.&nbsp; It was quite sad really.&nbsp; I guess this is why they shut the armoury down.&nbsp; It was all scams and no real guns being delivered.... just parts and ammo.<br /><br />I&#039;m more afraid of the attractiveness of guns to teenage boys.&nbsp; They will do anything for a gun.&nbsp; This is where law enforcement needs to focus on.&nbsp; Teens with guns is a real problem that should get priority over drugs.<br /><br />I think there could be a good strategy for SR is to develop dozens of gun dealer websites and small drug selling websites all over the darknet.&nbsp; There is strength in numbers and overwhelming the authorities is a good strategy.&nbsp; It would bankrupt them to investigate each one.&nbsp; Think about MP3 websites like Napster.&nbsp; Once there was hundreds of copycat websites, the law gave up on cracking down of song thefts.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				there is plenty of good and cheap heroin where I live and I tried a few vendors on SR and they werent bad it just wasnt any better than most stamps I could get and certainly not better than more than a handful of stamps ive seen. And this was at like almost 1/2 the price. <br /><br />but yeah On-Topic, under aged kids could definitely use SR pretty easily especially with services like BitInstant and other cash-to-bitcoin methods. I dont know how much it would detract from Silk Road&#039;s image since its already a pretty irrefutable one of negativity to the general masses and mass media.

				Most parents are super nosy though so there&#039;s a really big chance that they&#039;ll open the package so I don&#039;t think most kids will take that chance.<br />Even if its obviously a book my mom will still open the package just because she has nothing better to do lol.

				I agree, I hope and pretty strongly believe that the amount of children using the Silk Road is pretty small. I have thought about the fact, however, and honestly back when I had recently joined, the though of minors using the Silk Road did not frighten me much. The reason being, the Silk Road Forum used to be an intelligent place with a WEALTH of knowledge about different drugs and how to use them. If you had ANY questions about a drug you could come here and find it or come here and ask it. That fact made me feel safer, because the LAST thing we need is some kid OD-ing on drugs he bought off Silk Road without any knowledge of how to properly use it. Unfortunately, the forum and really, all of Silk Road has become a clusterfuck of spam and trolls, and that spells fucking trouble. I hope with all my heart that children don&#039;t use the Silk Road to buy drugs, but like I said, I really doubt that many do.

Whether it would be a good or bad idea for me to have done it isn&#039;t the point, it&#039;s just that having a place that is not your mom and dad&#039;s house to get shipped is half the process. Money wasnt a big deal to me, obviously it&#039;s circumstantial and depends on your family, or if you worked. in my case I worked but never had any living expenses living with my parents so the main thing my money went towards was drugs.<br /><br />as for figuring out the site itself, well I would say aside from learning PGP it really isn&#039;t that much less user friendly than amazon.com....<br /><br />but I agree that at least some of the buyers or a bulk of them who buy cigarettes and alcohol on SR are probably underage

				If I wasn&#039;t busy getting the shit beaten out of me in an orphanage, I&#039;d be busy buying drugs from SR, assuming I knew what it was.<br /><br />As it is, I personally know kids as young as 13 who told me they purchase from SR. It wasn&#039;t my place to interfere, all I can do is try to keep them safe.
