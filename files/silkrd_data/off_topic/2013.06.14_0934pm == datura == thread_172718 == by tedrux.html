				Who the fuck would buy datura on SR? It grows wild in many places and you can easily buy seeds on amazon I&#039;m pretty sure (they&#039;re also psychoactive). It&#039;s not a great high at all and overdoses are extremely unpleasant but not always lethal, you usually end up in a psych ward or something.

				i have never tried Datura before, but i think i should try it 1 time. according to the experiences in erowid, the negative effects are too overwhelming. but people do it for some reasons, it can alter reality completely and experience insanity. <br />i think Datura is the biggest proof that reality is nothing than few chemicals and electrodes in our minds.<br /><br />anyway, what am saying is my conclusion from others experiences, not mine.

I&#039;ve heard of people consuming some datura with shrooms, but the trip is only mildly tolerable that way.<br /><br />Best to avoid dangerous drugs. You&#039;re better off trying DOx, RCs that carry one hell of an amphetamine-fueled trip.

				Not sure about the lethal dose as it depends upon the specific species and what part of the plant you&#039;re ingesting. <br /><br />Suffice to say that the active alkaloids generally present in Datura are ones that can cause&nbsp; hallucinations in a way where the anchor of normality is cut and a free flight into a fear based oblivion commences. <br /><br />The journey, according to those that had done it (a few friends of mine) is catastrophically diabolical and emotionally soul tearing.<br /><br />Not fun at all.<br /><br />Some people are psychologically damaged......permanently. <br /><br />Advice. .....steer well away.

I hear its a great high, true or false? is it available on t he road?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, usually MORE than 5 grams of SEEDS are lethal (atropine and scopolamine are both lethal after a certain threshold; hallucinogenic/delirant in moderate does, permanent mental disabling at high doses and lethal at more than high doses, that it&#039;s usually above 5 grams but if you want to be sure you can take 10 or something). You don&#039;t need to look on the SR, you can find the plant very very easily in nature.<br /><br />Anyway, I gave this information to you NOT to use it but to make you understand to yourself that you don&#039;t really want to suicide (no matter how much you can think it consciously now) because elsewhere a simple thing as this you would already know (as for other plants as hemlock or foxglove that are even more potent as poisons). If you really wanted to die you would have already gone to a very high roof of some palace and jumped from that in these 3 months; no money required, very easy to do (you don&#039;t need any special thing), impossible to save you.<br /><br />So, stop this facade, it doesn&#039;t make you any good (above all to yourself; the worst thing you can do is lying to yourself, it is this primarily that causes you pain). You don&#039;t really want to die (you can THINK you want, but you don&#039;t want it), understand it and try to come to a resolution on how to remove yourself from your bad status instead of doing a thing you don&#039;t really want to do.<br /><br />One solution would be to use something that can make you understand your purpose in life as Ayahuasca, for example. I&#039;m already trying to help you in this direction in the other thread. If somebody will help me I will try to make you understand that what you think now is just an illusion of your conscious mind, nothing more.<br /><br />TO EVERYBODY: If people want to help let&#039;s pass the hat to buy this little child some Ayahuasca, it will cost almost nothing and let&#039;s give this guy the benefit of the doubt; we have nothing to lose in doing so and if we can really help someone we should IMO. Read the other thread (about cyanide) of the guy and post there in case you agree on collecting money to send him some Ayahuasca.

				Datura can be used safely, in ultra low doses as a dream potentiator it works wonders and can aid in lucid dreaming. Taking datura in delerient doses is asking for a seriously fucked up trip. Its not the scopolamine that is so lethal (although it can be if the dose is high enough), its the atropine (cardiotoxic). If one where deadset on experimenting with tropane plants I recommend solandra maxima as it has alot of scopolamine, and not very much atropine. That said, OP in your mental state you should not be messing with tropanes at all, you think you want to die now.. ha. In a tropane trip you probably would end up killing yourself.<br /><br />I knew a guy once who ate a bunch of jimson weed, They found him naked in the desert babbling nonsense and thinking he was some kind of animal. They took him to the psych ward and guess what, years later he is still there. In and out of the psych ward, rinse repeat. Still experiencing severe HPPD and schizophrenic like delusions. Do you really want to be that guy. You want to know what delerients are like, pop 15-25 benadryls (diphenhydramine). You will see shadow people, talk to imaginary family members, and be generally fucked up in a not so good way.<br /><br />Nobody enjoys there delerient trips, although some people can and do use them for psychospiritual reasons they generally have a very strong mind which it sounds like you do not have. Please reconsider such a foolish action, as these things are not to be taken lightly, I don&#039;t care how much experience with psychedelics you have. They are nothing like classical psychedelics (ie: shrooms), the only purpose these plants serve is if you truly want to explore the darkest regions of your mind, to straddle the line between life and death after which there is no guarantee you will re-emerge unscathed. Its people with dumb ideas like this that end up as anti-drug news stories. I suggest a little common sense, it can go a long way.<br /><br />Autism is not the end of the world, I have aspergers syndrome. It can be a gift if you allow it to be, you have unique talents that others could only dream of and in many cases autistic people have a capacity for intellect far beyond anything neurotypicals could ever comprehend. We will always be misunderstood sure, just drop out of the social game if you don&#039;t want to play it, the fact is that you don&#039;t have to. Be unique and stop caring what other people think. Go get piss drunk and talk to strangers if you want to be more sociable, if they don&#039;t like you or think you are weird, who gives a rats ass. Just be you. MDMA could be very very helpful in allowing you to open up to other people. Surely you have hobbies and interests. Guess what, you have the capacity to be better at those things than anyone else in the world, its a gift, use it to your advantage instead of dwelling on the negatives.<br /><br />Suicide is a never the answer, if you think it is then your simply wrong. Go out and get laid, call a prostitute if you have to, there are plenty of ads on craigslist. Go ask out 100 strangers, by the end of it your social anxiety will melt away, its called exposure therapy. The more you do something your afraid of or anxious about, the less you fear it.<br />

I would purchase it for him If I had the coins right now but I don&#039;t and I wont for a week. If anyone would be willing to send him some ayahuasca or other classical psychedelics please send him a PM asking for his address. He has made it explicitly clear that he has tried everything else and its either this or suicide. I hate to even ask this, but it very well might be the best thing for him at this point.
