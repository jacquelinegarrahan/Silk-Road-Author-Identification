				I am $2 short of a very large order, it&#039;s driving me nuts because I&#039;m so close. 3 times, I&#039;ve given a couple bucks to people asking for it. <br /><br />I know the forums aren&#039;t a charity, but I will gladly repay next time I put in if someone was willing to help me out. Also, would give positive karma on here every time I saw you. <br /><br />BTC address 1M2ZuzV6Bzd8S9PWuCb6U3x4qwaGFvGjvq . Only one person please, just need about $2.50. Thanks forums!

				i think 0.02 btc will be good enough. I sent it to you. I&#039;ve been in need of BTC before, and I&#039;ve asked but never received. Take this and find an alternative way of buying bitcoins when you&#039;re short by a few so there won&#039;t be a next time for situations like this . <br /><br />

				Cheers Monkey. Don&#039;t change your address, I&#039;m gonna send you some back in a bit.&nbsp; :)<br />I only like depositing large amounts so there are less transactions going into my account. <br /><br />Dolmio, fuck you. I read two sentences in to your pitiful response, and I&#039;m already bored, dazed, and confused. You make it sound like being a drug dealer is a bad thing.&nbsp; 8)

				Thanks Spanky. :) I like being able to help people short with the coin fluctuations, as I said I&#039;ve done it quite a few times for others. Much thanks to people like Monkey, this helped me out a lot.
