				Well, I&#039;ve taken NBOMe a few times in the last few weeks, and boy, has my life changed. Here is my full experience with it, for anyone who is interested. The first half is basically my experiences. Feel free to skip to the second half if you just want to hear me explain why logic cant explain everything, why analogue communication, what the central pattern is of the mind altering effects of psychedelics, and how NBOMe can be used as an ADHD medication. <br /><br />First time taking 25i: <br />The first time I took it, I was at school. First, I was really anxious and uncomfortable for about 30 minutes. Then, I had a great time in my last class(where we can basically talk all we want). As I was walking home with my best friend, he told me that I made an idiot out of myself, although he was impressed after I told him I was on what wight as well have been LSD. When we got to his house, we saw someone had been messing with his front gate. I was initially really scared about it, then I realized that it had been the mail man. I saw that the mailman had closed the gate in sucdh a way that was nearly impossible to open, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever laughed so hard in my life. Next, I tried talking to my friend(who I normally have exceptional &quot;bro-chemistry&quot; with, but he didnt understand any of the concepts I was trying to explain to him. I gave him a tab, and we literally spent the next 16 hours talking about Halo armor. I slept for thirty minutes, took another tab, and then went to class. I somehow functioned all the way through. Listening to music afterwards was Quite unpleasant. Instead of hearitg music, I just heard drums being hit and guitar strings being plucked. I got home and slept for nearly 24 hours. <br /><br />Aftermath: <br /><br />A little after I woke up, my friend called me to tell me that there was no sign of the bag of NBOMe tabs I lost at his house. Additionally, when he was at school(which I had slept through), he was talking to a girl I was half-dating,half-friend-zoned with, and she had said she has no romantic interest in me. <br /><br />With a combination of that, low seratonin levels, and post-NBOMe introspection, the next few days were some of the angstiest of my life. All my goals and ambitions had suddenly evaporated. I realized I am not nearly as cool as I think I am. I felt no purpose in life, and no emotion at anything. I almost wanted to commit suicide; not because I was depressed, but because I was simply done living, and that it was really the only thing left. If I had had access to a heroin dosage that was lethal, I feel as though the odds weren&#039;t unreasonable that I would have administered it. <br /><br />I talked about it with a friend who had gone through something similar, and he told me that &quot;You just have to keep going. You have to know that the feeling will pass. You can&#039;t ever consider the possibility that achieving your goals won&#039;t make you happy, and if youre worried about what that girl feels about you, you just have to pour your heart out to her, if there&#039;s even just a remote chance she&#039;ll accept you as more than a friend. You think this will be easy to do now, but it wont be when you go for it. You cant hesitate. You can&#039;t do it on xanax either, because it wont be you; it&#039;ll be a false version of you.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Well, after about a week, my apathy passed, though I didn&#039;t talk to the girl. I was worried that I couldn&#039;t find the bag of tabs, since I had hid it while I was under the effects. About a week later, my friend&#039;s mom found it at his house while she was cleaning. When she saw the contents, she asked my friend, &quot;what were you doing with this!?&quot;. MY friend told her, &quot;oh, that was Bynter&#039;s. He hid it here while on it, and then lost it&quot; Her response was, &quot;Hmmm. Well be sure to give it back to him. Also, tell him he shouldnt buy the cheap stuff(somehow, she knew it wasnt LSD, although she did know it was hallucinogenic.) <br /><br />About a week after that, I decided I needed to make some money. I know this is highly frowned upon, but I gave a sample to one of my stoner friends, telling him it was &quot;acid&quot;. He took it, and the next day, he told me, &quot;Holy shit, man! That was great, I was tripping for hours. This is Grateful Dead LSD! Youre only selling them for $6 a piece? Do you know what you have? ill buy all of them!&quot; So I sold 40 tabs at a 700% profit, and within two days, he called wanting to buy 100 more. <br /><br />2nd 25I experience: Well I had to write a research paper for school, but I got writer&#039;s block, so I took a tab, along with some Adderall. About an hour later, when I was shaking and coming to all sorts of conclusions in my mind, I realized that I was getting no where on the paper, and should just enjoy the high. I walked around the campus, and found some people talking about videogames. I decided to get into a discussion about the combat system of Dragon&#039;s Dogma, and that was just a bad call. After a few minutes, I realized no one had any idea what the fuck it was I was talking about, and the more I spoke, the less sense I made. I decided to go get some food from the cafeteria, where I attempted to order a &quot;A sandwich with your choice of bacon or ham&quot;. I saw a friend of mine walking around, and convinced him to skip class so I could try and explain some of the ideas I had. <br /><br />After spending abut twe haurs trying to make some obscure analogy about a toaster, he said, &quot;this is interesting and all, but I got an essay for film class due in two hours.&quot; I told him I&#039;m great at writing essays, and after I read the first two paragraphs of the Wikipedia plot summary on the film, which was a movie hadn&#039;t seen, I basically wrote the essay in my idea. All he had to do was type it, and help me put some of my ideas into words. He ended up getting B+ on it. <br /><br /><br />Warning: The following may be confusing. It exists as an abstraction in my head that makes perfect sense. However, NBOMe taught me just how limited language is, as so the following only describes a concept that you must make an effort to piece tocehter in your head in order to fully understand. <br /><br />After he left, I decided that I would make a final effort to put one of my ideas into words. I realized that most of the ideas I came up with made perfect sense, but not when put into words. They exist very vividly as abstractions in my head, largely in the same way that colors or emotions exist as abstractions. I realized that to explain them in logical words, I would have to perfectly explain what I meant, and define every word. Pretty soon, my explanation was basically in a computer programming language, complete with &quot;if, then, else&quot; statements. I learned that I can&#039;t accurately describe my ideas that exist as abstractions; however, that if I wrote them as instructions that were in a programming language, someone else could read and interpret them, eQuivelant to compiling and executing them, and when they were finished, the abstraction would exist in their head and they&#039;d be able to understand it as well. <br /><br />I figured out that abstract epistemology is just as valid as logic. Too often, people say what can&#039;t be scientifically proved is invalid. However, read the &quot;Mary in a black &amp; white room&quot; thought experiment. The color, &quot;red&quot; exists in a manner that can&#039;t be logically observed. However, it obviously exists. 2+2=&quot;the colour red&quot; isnt correct, and it isnt false. 4 exists on the logical plane of criteria, and colours exist in the abstract plane of criteria&#039; and the two aren&#039;t compatible. <br /><br />What I found interesting was that the abstractions in my head, couldnt really be described logically, unless it was in hyper-logial terms(computer code). I realized that on NBOMe, there were vivid abstractions in my head, and the only logical interpretation of it had to exist as DEFINEing it fully. When sober, ideas exist as vague abstractions, and when trying to put it into LOGICAL language, the result is a partial DESCRIPTION. (Notice the difference between &quot;describe&quot; and &quot;define&quot;) I realized that the concept of a dictionary is stupid. Words should exist to represent an abstract idea that words should only be able to describe, and that the definition should only be able to exist as an abstraction in the mind that is comprised of someone piecing together all the words that describe it, and then having a fuzzy idea of where they all overlap. <br /><br />Finally, NBOMe taught me the importance of the concept of &quot;analogue&quot;. People think too much in digital terms. You can look at a color spectrum, and have a very clear idea of where, &quot;blue&quot; is. However, it is impossible to say exactly where blue begins and ends. <br />Analogue is abstract, digital is logical. Language can be broken down into words with indiscreet definitions. For this reason, it is essential that art exists, as experiencing art will tell you something that even the most comprehensive text summary &amp; essay can&#039;t convey. Since I took NBOMe, I now feel I understand the meaning of Nirvana songs, although I really dont fell as though <br />I could put the meanings into words (though maybe I could write instructions in code, so that if you followed them, someone who dant heard the song would be able to understand what it&#039;s meaning was). Hearing someone play a Grand Piano tells you something that hearing the same song played on a MIDI wont. <br /><br /><br /><br />Also, I feel that NBOMe was the best anti-anxiety/ADHD medication I could have ever taken; more effective than Adderall, Ritalin, Straterra, and Prozac. Before, I would try and do school work, and then something would pop into my head, like &quot;how does the Haldron Collider work&quot;? and as much as I would try, it would chew at the back of my mind until I looked it up. Now, I feel it is much easier to just &quot;let go&quot; and get some schoolwork done. Now that I know of the importance of abstractions and analogue thinking, Im much more content letting ideas exist in my head without spending the time to research them and try to put them into words. I used to clean my house and not be content until there was nothing left unattended to. Now, I can look at the the cleanliness of my house not as the components on a &quot;to-do&quot; list that I must completely satisfy, but instead, I can just look at the cleanliness of it as an overall abstraction, almost as an &quot;essence&quot;. Now I&#039;ll find it a lot easier when on Adderall to convince myself, when Im, say.... reading a book, to be fine with just getting the overall idea and being content with that, instead of feeling as though I must read every page, the preface, the author&#039;s notes, and the epilogue. Tink of all the time we&#039;d save in our lives if we didnt take the time to decide &quot;soup or salad&quot; since we&#039;ll probably be relatively fine with either. <br /><br />tl;dr: NBOMe makes most people hallucinate; it just makes me write ideas in computer code. What the fuck?

				I had to stop when I read you sold a kid the 25i tab as LSD. The first time was like okay, things happen, but you did it to him again with him still being under the impression that it was actually LSD? Jesus man, thank god for SR, this is exactly the shit that kept me from even seeking out real L around my parts.

				Most of the people I sell to know very little about pharmacology, and it&#039;d make absolutely no difference to them if I was selling them &quot;acid&quot; or &quot;NBOMe, it&#039;s alot like acid&quot;. I&#039;ve had people reject my offers to sell them &quot;LSD&quot;, but be more than enthusiastic to buy &quot;acid&quot;. That&#039;s how uneducated people are.

				Damn, I guess i underestimated the dangers of it. I thought NBOMe was safe up until like 6mgs.

Keep the Nbome&#039;s for out of school hours, so you can really get somewhere interesting on them, don&#039;t use repeatedly (it&#039;s a waste), and be mindful your mind isn&#039;t &quot;fully physically developed&quot; until your early 20&#039;s or so, so you should avoid sustained chemical attacks on its unfinished structures...

				I really enjoyed your write-up. This is definitely a substance I&#039;ll look into for the future! However, a few words of caution...I&#039;ve been somewhat in your position with school and drug taking, and I&#039;ll just say don&#039;t get too used to it. Once you learn to live on drugs and doing homework high and whatnot, it&#039;s very hard to unlearn and figure out how you&#039;d ever want to live life without them. <br /><br />I think your a very interesting and smart person, just beware that entering too far into those &#039;contemplative&#039; states where you judge the meaning of life, why quantum physics creates a rational universe, and how pointless living is. I absolutely LOVE talking about and thinking about those things, but it starts to become toxic to your thoughts and I lost all connection with reality. I started living like I was just in a world of interacting forces and particles and completely forgot about the joy of living and human interaction. Though life may be pointless, as far as we know its the only one we have, so might as well try to enjoy and experience everything while we have the chance.<br />I&#039;d just hate to see someone take their own life because they took a very reductionist view of the world we live in, as it was only last year I tried to take my own following that same line of thinking.<br />Just remember people, those feelings will always pass!

				A dealer around my area was selling lsd too cheap and I tested a tab and it was 25i apparently there was some kid supplying this dealer with tons of tabs saying they were lsd. Needless to say that kid got himself fucked up something fierce once I informed the dealer he had been tricked.

				I market my 25i-nbome tabs to my customers as exactly that. Anyone with a fucking brain or a lick of experience knows that a bitter taste and super tongue/mouth numbing is 25i and not LSD. That being said I still have no problem selling 10-strips for $100, 25 for $250 and 40-50 for $400-$500 - as you can see I stick to 10/ea no matter how much they get, and I may throw in a few just cause if they are getting a lot. They are just happy that they can trip balls off half a 1mg tab, cause 25i is strong stuff.<br /><br />Don&#039;t lie, it&#039;ll save your ass in the long run and your customers will come back for more if they like it.
