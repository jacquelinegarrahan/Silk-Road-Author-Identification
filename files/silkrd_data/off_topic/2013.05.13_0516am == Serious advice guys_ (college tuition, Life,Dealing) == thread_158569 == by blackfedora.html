				i&#039;v entered a stage in my life where i don&#039;t want to end up living the the conditions i am now, i would like to make something of my self and be successful and provide for my family, i consider myself a young adult (20&#039;s) and the only way i can see myself doing that is putting myself through school and advancing my education, unfortunatly i was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth, i never had the grades to get scholarships (not because im a dumb person Just lots of family issues during highschool) and the only way i can see myself going to college anytime soon is dealing and selling drugs, i know it is probably not going to be easy and if caught my life may be ruined, but i might as well take the chance at success than living all my life poor. my question is what would be the best drug to deal? i would like to make an average of 30k a year so that i can keep myself with as little stress as possible so i may focus completely on my education, what should i sell? and in what quantities, with the least plausible risk?

				Well, there&#039;s several routes and strategies you can take. <br /><br />First and foremost - you mention your grades, and while raw, gifted intelligence is a factor, the desire to succeed ultimately determines who gets A&#039;s and who fails. You&#039;ve expressed a desire to succeed, and to do so via college. So you&#039;re 95% of the way to being successful in today&#039;s society, (as is conventionally considered &#039;success&#039;)<br /><br />First off, strip yourself of the notions that you need an expensive-school education. If you do well, and show an employer that you&#039;re capable, you&#039;ll get a job, and it&#039;s all uphill from there. Do well, get references, etc. College is like the block you dive into the pool off of; its ultimately how good a swimmer you are that determines how far you go.<br /><br />What I mean is, go to community college for your first 2 years, to get the credits, pre-requisites, and other such shit out of the way. The last 2 years are the ones that &quot;matter,&quot; and if you&#039;ve done well so far, you&#039;ll get in somewhere good, and with a scholarship. Society has falsely taught you that there is &quot;shame&quot; in attending community college, but this is a scam and a willful lie.<br /><br />This, you could do without dealing drugs. Get a full-time job, even a shitty one, and you can stay on the right side of the law. Your life may not be as fun (and I&#039;ll get to that later), but you won&#039;t have to risk the rest of your life with drug dealing.<br /><br />Section 2: Dealing drugs for fun and profit.<br /><br />Well, weed is both relatively safe (you&#039;re more likely to get caught selling MDMA or coke, as well as encounter riskier people) and highly popular! You&#039;ll always find customers. Profit margins are good, 2x-3x is possible if you turn a $750 QP into 32, $50 eighths - doubling your money.<br /><br />Selling 3-4 eighths a day, you&#039;ll make enough to support a comfortable lifestyle and attend college. There isn&#039;t undue risk, just be discerning with your customers and don&#039;t get greedy.<br />Another route is to supply a few dealers, which done right can be safer, and done wrong can be even more dangerous - make sure you trust none of them to rat on you, and you can just make a business of fronting QP&#039;s out of pounds.&nbsp; <br /><br />NBOME&#039;s offer a significantly higher profit margin; if you can drum up some interest and you&#039;re in an area unfamiliar with them (and how cheap they are), you could get away selling them for 5-10x profit margin. This means you have to sell less, or, you can make more for your investment. This WILL require a huge customer base though, and therefore sub-dealers working for you.<br /><br />Section 3: What do you actually want in your life? At any given point, saying, &quot;I&#039;m only doing this, so I can be happy doing what I want later,&quot; is risky. Some people spend their entire lives doing that. Make long-term goals and sacrifice things for them, but ultimately, always seek satisfaction with your life. Going to college is maybe 25% about getting a degree, and 75% about finding job opportunities and networking, so you can have a job afterwards. Classes, yes, but more importantly clubs, organizations, and forming connections.

				Sell molly in college, it wil sell itself (actually most drugs sell themselves) above all else be careful, a car is probably necessary and exceptional hiding spots (never forget it is illegal) only sell to people you know and can &#039;find&#039; after a deal goes bad (i.e. getting robbed) <br /><br />sudy up on the laws and dont carry more than you can get busted with intent to sell...<br /><br />dont bring more than you need a anywhere and dont get too ambitious (slow and steady wins the race)<br /><br />also always say you know a guy, you never want people to know that you are the &quot;guy&quot;<br /><br />Xanax will sell soo fucking fast anywhere you go especially the bars you can get on SR<br />adderall and other &#039;study drugs&#039; go without saying as well<br /><br /><br />and as for college usually it is more expensive than it is worth, people are p[aying off loans into their 40s these days and the interest is more than the principle if you dedicate as much time, money, effort etc into dealing professionally rather than school work taxes blah blah blah youll make more and your family will be financially set forever. Youre still young start now and youll build a huge pyramid of sub-dealers working beneath you, only 2-5 people you&#039;ve come to trust and they each have their own 2-5 people who do not ever know you...<br /><br />good luck with whatever path you decide.

				Weed is probably your best bet. I have seen a few of my buddies make a killing with it. Also police in my area tend to go after Coke, Pills, Herion, MDMA and drugs along those lines much harder than weed. MDMA trafficking here starts at one ounce, or about $800 worth. Marijuana Trafficking starts at 10 LBS. Or in terms of what thats worth on the street. About 30k or so. If I had a LB right now I could get 4k for it just by driving across town.<br /><br />That being said your best bet is to cease all drug usage, it is a major distraction from taking your life seriously. And dealing is not the best answer. What I do is help my friends out every now and then. I do not consistently deal anymore. Go to a community college for 2 years and make grades good enough to qualify for a scholarship and financial aid. Also you can almost always take out a loan to pay for school. As long as you are in school you do not have to pay the loan. Also paying loans with drug money is a great way to launder money. The banks just want their cash and as long as they get it they won&#039;t report you. I&#039;m no lawyer though so don&#039;t take my word for it.

				Best advice.<br /><br />If you do choose to start dealing in contraband. Choose a product and stick to it. <br /><br />Don&#039;t sell mdma one week and then valium the next. customers will get confused and go elsewhere<br /><br />S&amp;S

				Easier money knocking out a bit of this and that to get through college but let&#039;s say it works and you get your qualifications and close to the end you&#039;re caught dealing and you get a record for it, how badly would that affect your future job prospects after all you put in?<br /><br />Suppose it depends on how much and what you were caught with.

				Oh boy, If I had a nickel for every starry eyed youth who told me he was going to deal to pay for school..&nbsp; <br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t be asking us what you should sell.. you should be analyzing your local market to see what needs sold. If you can&#039;t do that then you should get a job to keep yourself afloat while you start your research. <br /><br />How much capital do you have to start with? If you don&#039;t have any how do you plan to get it? If you start out with a few hundered bucks I recommend starting with nbome or something cheap that you can have huge margins with. The risks with these substances are smaller as well, at least insofar as you won&#039;t have to deal with so many predatory veterans as you would in say H or tweak. If you dive headfirst into the scene without patience you will run into trouble.<br /><br />There is no low-stress drug dealing... or if there is you won&#039;t attain that for a good long while. You can obviously deal and study, but you will have crisis occuring now and again. Also, Idk your situation... but you will need a front if you are going to go to school. A damn good one actually. Even if you aren&#039;t going to school, get a front. The financial systems and the IRS are more scary to me then any narcotics task force. <br /><br />School is a scam btw.. degrees are no longer worth the cost of tuition in most places. What do you want to do? If you study on your own and put in half of the effort that dealing will drain from you, perhaps you can sidestep school depending on your specific desired position/field.<br /><br />Keep up on your healthy nutrition and exercise. Try not to look like a &quot;drug dealer&quot;. Often overlooked believe it or not. Learn to do drugs safely and discreetly. You will do lots of &quot;bad&quot; things.. so process that mentally so that you don&#039;t get all sorts of weird self-defeating guilt issues about your life. &quot;Flexibility&quot; should be the word that represents you.<br /><br />...Yikes, I sound negative. Seriously, I am not going to sit here and tell you not to do it. Go for it man!&nbsp; ;D<br />We all had to start at one time or another.. and yes, you will get fucked over and pissed on, you will struggle through a lot of neck deep shit. Hopefully you can push through all of that and find some success. <br />The biggest thing that I want to correct you on is the perception that drug dealing is easy.. or even moderately difficult. It isn&#039;t something that you do on the side so that you can go to school. If you don&#039;t take it seriously you won&#039;t be able to support yourself or go to school. If you do take it seriously then you will eventually support yourself, and you probably won&#039;t end up going to school because you have a career.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Sorry for rambling, I hope the best for you whichever way you go.. just work hard and smart.. and don&#039;t get a big head. If you have uncertainties use these forums.. lot&#039;s of good info buried on here, lots of people with real experience.&nbsp; <br />

				OK, so I hate to be the one to be negative but how do you think drug dealing works? 30k a year? I mean do you have the kind of contacts that want to buy quantities to provide for this lifestyle you want? Don&#039;t get in over your head, all you&#039;ll do is make things worse for yourself. Get a game plan sorted, find a supplier on the silkroad who can supply a few oz&#039;s of weed at a time or whatever it is you want to sell, and then start making contacts who can buy from you in small amounts. Start from the bottom, and work your way up. Good luck, but like I say, just don&#039;t get in over your head.

				Don&#039;t be afraid to start off at a Junior/Community college first. It will get your gen eds out of the way and it will save you a shit ton of money.. I had to drop out of a university my freshman year after 1 semester because i was already 10k in debt, whereas at my current JUCO i dont pay a penny... and apply for your FASFA the second you get your tax return back

Selling in person vs. having the option of selling on the road, I can&#039;t think of any pros for in person other than, &quot;cash in hand, sooner&quot; I&#039;d imagine, as you envision it, selling on the road is a much better option than in person. <br /><br />Zero face-to-face risk.<br />Zero fucked-up customers turning you in.<br />Basically everything that makes the road golden. You start up, send out some samples, maybe limit yourself to experienced / proven buyers...<br />All of which is impossible with face-to-face.

I believe in trusting a serious partner if you have one, but that doesn&#039;t mean that you should set yourself up. I think that you guys probably just watch Blow too often, or have trusted one too many bitches that you shouldn&#039;t have. <br /><br />Don&#039;t take any of this to mean that you should just trust every hussy that you have been seeing for a couple months..

				Yeah my girl knows as well, she doesnt know specifics but she knows and shes smart enough to know never to open her mouth about it at all....ever....<br /><br />If you&#039;re moving LBS for 1k each...fuck college, sorry maybe its not the most noble thing to tell a kid but honestly thats a better profit than a lot of legit businesses and no college=no debt and you wont waste time either. <br /><br />Pro tip: everything they teach you in college you can learn on the internet for free ;)<br /><br />PS Jack i liked your old signature better (I may be insane but im not crazy) lol
