				Ok so i have been trying to get to Amsterdam for the last 6 years and finally i am going to get there. Shortly i will be heading there for a week and i really want to ask peoples advice on;<br />a) Best coffee shops<br />b) Best strains<br />c) non drug related things to do<br />I will start by saying im going with my girlfriend and two other couples and as such red light district games are basically off the table. Also cannabis will be the only drug that will be consumed, i have a hard enough time hiding the rest of my drug usage from my missus without getting off my tits in front of her. We are staying not far from Oosterpark so any local information would be good, read that there are quite a few good markets in Amsterdam and one not far from Oosterpark. <br />I did notice that while we are there, there is a showing of 2001:A Space Odessy with a live orchestra which i imagine will be fucking incredible.<br /><br />But yea any tips and advice would be much appreciate,<br />Cheers Guys =)

				I&#039;ve been about 20 times over the years, a few tips for you.<br /><br />Stay away from the tourist coffee shops, the local ones hidden away up the side alleys etc. sell better weed and are cheaper.<br /><br />Dont go behind central station - junkie madness, likely to get robbed.<br /><br />And avoid bikes and trams, as when you&#039;re stoned out your face they are fucking dangerous. I&#039;ve been hit by a few cyclists and nearly got trammed once.<br /><br />But you&#039;ll have a blast that&#039;s for sure.

				I could be wrong, but don&#039;t you have to be a Dutch citizen to buy weed these days? Or has that not been implemented yet?

It&#039;s done on a city by city basis.<br /><br />The next government which is likely to come to power soon will scrap the Weed ID card scheme anyway so no need to worry about it for long.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25670.msg274946#msg274946">Quote from: Japan1980 on June 05, 2012, 05:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And avoid bikes and trams, as when you&#039;re stoned out your face they are fucking dangerous.

Those trams are sneaky buggers. <br /><br />Also don&#039;t take mushrooms and jump out of your hostel window like a friend of mine did. The buildings are really tall there.
