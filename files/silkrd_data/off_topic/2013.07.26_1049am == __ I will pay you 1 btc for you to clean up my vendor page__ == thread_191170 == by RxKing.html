				<br />Just like the title says! I will pay you 1 btc for you to reformat my vendor page and make it look nice. I want all my words...so that is what makes this very easy....I just need someone that &quot;knows&quot; that they are doing as I want it to look the best it can with the tools silk road allows you to use.<br /><br />You must really know what you are doing as I do not want someone that just needs the coin and thinks they can do it. <br /><br />The first person that post below that tells me why they are qualified or better yet can show me a page they did I will hire and pay them.<br /><br />Thanks for your time...

				I put together the guide that&#039;s in my signature...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m considered qualified or not but I wouldn&#039;t care to help a reputable vendor out.

				I can do it no problem, Without going into my IRL qualifications, I design much more&nbsp; complicated layouts from scratch but you have to give me a basic &quot;design brief&quot; of what you would want or just link to examples of vendor pages that you like and feel convey the image you want to represent. /pompous WebDev speak
