				anybody know if these guys are from SR?<br /><br />seemed kind of foolish, digging an underground grow room, in the backyard of an attached house, in a small british community, and constantly having 11 male friends over - folks are nosy in small communities<br /><br />but can&#039;t really tell if their lack of discretion caused the bust or one of the idiots doing somthing somewhere else, leading them back<br /><br />need to visit the clearnet url to see the photos<br /><br /><br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2382526/The-picture-postcard-cottage-home-drugs-gang-Police-33-000-cannabis-vault-home-leading-11-men-jailed-total-70-years.html<br /><br />The picture postcard cottage that was home to a drugs gang: Police find £33,000 of cannabis in vault below home leading to 11 men being jailed for total of 70 years<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bunker contained 76 cannabis plants, cocaine, guns and ammunition<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The cottage in Kilmersdon, Somerset, was rented by Mike Gorham, 55<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ringleader Steve Tamblyn, 29, jailed for 15 years alongside his friends<br /><br />By Helen Lawson<br /><br />PUBLISHED: 13:20 GMT, 1 August 2013 | UPDATED: 16:11 GMT, 1 August 2013<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Police tracking a drugs gang found their base in the most unlikely of places: a secret bunker in the garden of this pretty country cottage.<br /><br />The vault was home to an estimated £33,000 worth of cannabis plants along with a stash of cocaine, guns and ammunition.<br /><br />The gang had dug out the 50ft garden of the £350,000 cottage, which was rented by one of their members, and hid the entrance under patio decking.<br />This pretty cottage in Kilmersdon, Somerset, turned out to have a drugs bunker hidden under garden decking<br /><br />This pretty cottage in Kilmersdon, Somerset, turned out to have a drugs bunker hidden under garden decking<br /><br />Eleven men have now been jailed for a total of 70 years as part of a conspiracy to supply cocaine and firearms.<br /><br />Neighbours in Kilmersdon, Somerset, said the occupants of house &#039;kept themselves to themselves&#039; and they had no idea what was going on.<br /><br />Percival Fowler, 91, said: &#039;We could see things going on in the house, people were always coming and going and they used to have meetings, but we had no idea why.<br /><br />&#039;The house was always very busy, quite often there were people in there and quite a lot of them went down into the garden.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&#039;I never suspected it was a drugs bunker, it never really affected us or anybody else on the street, they kept themselves to themselves.<br /><br />&#039;It was all happening under our noses and we failed to spot it, they were very secretive.<br /><br />&#039;People realised there was something happening, we didn’t really realise what it was though, we didn’t realise there was that many people involved either.<br /><br />&#039;They had a lot of meetings in the garden, they would be down there all the time.<br /><br />&#039;It’s quite a small village so it came as a bit of a shock really when we saw the police cars.&#039;<br /><br />Detectives discovered the bunker in January 2011 when they followed Mike Gorham, 55, to the rented cottage and he disappeared out of sight.<br /><br />They later found him hiding in the bunker with Steve Tamblyn, 29, the ringleader of the operation.<br /><br />Police uncovered the 76 cannabis plants, a small amount of cocaine and a hydraulic press in the hidden bunker.<br /><br />The gang was also later discovered to be involved in supplying firearms, and a raid on another property revealed five guns alongside live ammunition and bullet-making equipment.<br /><br />Eleven members of the gang were jailed at Bristol Crown Court last month.<br /><br />Tamblyn, 29, of Midsomer Norton, was jailed for a total of 15 years and Philip Freeman, 39, of Frome, for a total of 14 years.<br /><br />Warren Gosz, 40, of Peasedown St John, was sentenced to eight years and Ian Comins, 42, of Radstock, received a seven year sentence.<br /><br />Geoffrey Goold, 54, who has lived in Weston, in Bath, was handed a three-year sentence.<br /><br />Gorham, 55, of Kilmersdon, was jailed for four-and-a-half years, Lucas Taylor was jailed for six years and Ben Taylor, 28, was jailed for four years.<br /><br />Ross Rawlins, 23, of Kingswood, Bristol, received a 26 month sentence and Alan Pinner, 40, of Radstock, was sentenced to three years.<br /><br />Scott Heal, 28, of Radstock, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years.<br /><br />DI Tina Robinson said: &#039;Illegal drugs and firearms have no place in our communities and this case should go to show that we will continue to target and bring organised criminals to justice.<br /><br />&#039;These men were part of a sophisticated conspiracy and some managed to hide their crime from both their employers and family for some time.<br /><br />&#039;However they were not successful in evading us.<br /><br />&#039;The sentences given today reflect the severity of their crime and I hope they will deter others from getting involved in the supply of Class A drugs and deadly weapons.<br /><br />Judge Julian Lambert, sentencing, said: &#039;These are very serious offences. Gun crime remains all too prevalent in this country.&#039;<br /><br />The three-bedroom 200-year-old cottage sits in the Mendip countryside and is part of estates belonging to Lord Hylton, one of the few remaining hereditary peers in the House of Lords.<br /><br />The house is owned and run by a charitable housing association which provides affordable housing for local people in the 550-population village.<br /><br />It is now being rented by a tenant with no connection to the gang and the garden has been filled in after it was dug out to create the bunker.<br /><br />
