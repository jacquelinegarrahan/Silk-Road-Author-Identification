				I need some advice.&nbsp; I want to open a LR account, use anarcho47 ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1066.0 ) method of pulling out some BTC&#039;s.&nbsp; Anarcho47 states that once you end up with your tumbled funds at LR, they will send you a CC.&nbsp; I have PM&#039;ed you as well Anarcho47 since I figure you will know.<br /><br />This sounds great but don&#039;t I lose my anonymity providing LR with my real info?&nbsp; Next, you need an exchanger like Mt Gox and I certainly have heard not use real info there either.&nbsp; My first thought is use fake info at LR, but then if they send a CC, I have to use it with another persons&nbsp; name on it.&nbsp; Not a problem most places and certainly not if withdraw from an ATM using a PIN#.&nbsp; But to get that CC, they will need a mailing addy at a minimum.<br /><br />How do folks handle this and is LR really that tight to let my personal info into their hands?<br /><br />Peace PK

				You could do the same as you do as buyer on SR, get a dead mailbox or fake some.<br />This could give you an anonymous access to LR, even with having the CC.

				Four words: Step The Fuck Away Fast! :o OK that&#039;s five words, and here&#039;s some more besides...<br /><br />LR are nothing but trouble. I tried to use this method and it is a MAJOR threat to your anonymity and your personal bank account.<br /><br />The main problem with LR is they are not a one-stop-shop. You&#039;ll need to get an &#039;exchange&#039; account from a 3rd party, a list of whom LR provide, but look closely at where they are based! Russia, Nigeria, China, etc.<br /><br />I tried to use one wallet/exchanger supposedly from New Zealand (they were actually based in no less than 2 other &#039;tax haven&#039; countries). <br /><br />They took over 2 days to get back to me and then demanded I provide scans of my CC and drivers license (front and back, both cards) I don&#039;t fucking think I&#039;m so inclined to be so stupid!&nbsp; <br /><br />Since by now they had some &#039;start up&#039; funds and my CC merchant details in escrow, I had no choice but to contact my CC company and ask them to suspend my account on the grounds of potential fraudulent activity. A major pain in the arse that took weeks to resolve -and I was without my favorite card during this time.<br /><br />LR and &#039;friends&#039; are not recommended unless you like giving money away to 3rd world scammers. Stick to the methods described elsewhere in these forums for getting your BTC.
