				What&#039;s up with people leaving karma for no reason? Most of us here try to keep a good reputation, I have no idea why I have -2 karma, I haven&#039;t said anything offensive, complained about downtime, I think before I post so this wouldn&#039;t happen. I&#039;m trying to keep my reputation good because I plan to remain a buyer on SR and stay active on the forums, It&#039;s not a big deal to me or probably a lot of others on here, but it just bothers me for some reason because I&#039;ve done nothing wrong or posted anything ridiculous besides one thread making fun of everyone&#039;s conspiracies on SR downtime, but obviously I wasn&#039;t serious. Karma isn&#039;t really important at all in my opinion, but if SR went down again for a long period of time, and you were a vendor selling to certain people on the forum, I think it could be used as an efficient way of how trustworthy the person is, obviously if you were a buyer and SR was down and someone offers to sell you on here, you wouldn&#039;t buy from them if they have +3|-20 because it&#039;s so inaccurate. I&#039;ve seen admins/mods on here with +300/-200 and I&#039;ve seen them post only on-topic information relating to whatever the thread was about that they were posting in. As I said, no one really cares about karma, I&#039;ve just noticed it&#039;s so inaccurate.&nbsp; <br />There&#039;s really no actual point of a karma system because 50% of the people on the forums lately have been trolls or angry junkies fiending, etc.<br />I know forum staff is busy, but I think we all wish half of the people on here lately should be banned. Tried to go through DPR&#039;s update thread yesterday looking for useful information and literally 75% of all the replies were just bullshit. <br /><br />I got kind of off-topic and typed more than I intended to, sorry, I can&#039;t sleep and have literally nothing else interesting to do, hopefully you get the point at least.

				You&#039;ve hit the nail on the head when you described typical forum users these days. Anyway don&#039;t let the karma thing prevent you from what you want to contribute in the forum, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll anyway get recognized :) And +1 from me to balance things a bit ;)

I posted this in the off-topic section, meaning it&#039;s not important. yet you read it out of choice but gave a -1 because I was trying to explain how it could be used for other reasons. You don&#039;t agree? I just don&#039;t see what was wrong with me posting this, yes, it&#039;s complaining, but the type of complaining that should get people -1 is &quot;OMG DPR RAN OFF WITH ALL THE BITCOINS WE ARE FUCKED.&quot;.&nbsp; I know this is stupid, I wasn&#039;t even going to post it at first, I just got bored and figured it would make type of sense and maybe someone knew what I meant. I understand this isn&#039;t important at all and no one really cares but it was just my opinion on it, not being a dick but you&#039;d be a good example. <br />Click on a thread, read it, if it&#039;s not interesting to you, just do what everyone else does and use that left arrow in your browser. <br /><br />I think opinions should be accepted because there&#039;s really no reason for giving someone -1 because of how they feel/think about something. <br /><br />In my opinion, +1 should be for someone posting useful information, answering a question, helping someone, etc.<br />-1 should be given for arguing, trolling, spamming, etc, I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s how it was meant to work anyways. <br />It actually makes sense why it&#039;s so inaccurate, face it, the forums are pretty unorganized and there&#039;s a shitload of people spamming and it continues to happen, this isn&#039;t anyone&#039;s fault, I understand the mods and admins are busy and can&#039;t take care of stuff 24/7, it&#039;s just amazing how many people come on here to troll and spam and some stay on here to do that stupid shit all day. (example: TiredofThisBullshit, and the ones spamming the &quot;$7 FOR 10 BITCOIN GO TO THIS LINK.&quot;, every board on the forums is flooded with that post. Fuck, I hope all these weird ass people stop posting now that everything&#039;s working again.<br /><br /><br />Added onto this a lot, sorry again if it&#039;s too much to read, didn&#039;t post cause someone replied and I didn&#039;t notice so I figured I wasn&#039;t done. lol

				The real karma is in your life, and you make your own karma by doing good or bad things in real life.<br />As long as you know in your heart that you are good person, and you behave as a good person your karma will always stay positive.<br />Don&#039;t give a damn about some Bath Salt crackhead who gave you -1. You forget that you are in a drugged ppl community&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Peace

				Yeah, I&#039;m aware it doesn&#039;t do anything, but I see it to help build some kind of trust in certain situations, of course I got -3 from posting this, kinda saw that coming. Real funny, guys. ;)

				Forum karma is a silly concept and means nothing. Anyone who bases their opinion of you on those dumb pluses and minuses is an idiot you don&#039;t want liking you.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give + karma here and there, since I know it means something to some people. (I remember giving you a +1 for something sora)<br /><br />But I don&#039;t bother giving negative karma, nor do my own karma numbers mean anything to me.
