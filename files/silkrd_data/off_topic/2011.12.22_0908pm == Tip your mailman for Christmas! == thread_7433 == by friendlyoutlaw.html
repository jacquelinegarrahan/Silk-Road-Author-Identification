				Some people always tip their mailman at Christmas. I never have.<br /><br />But this year, it occurred to me...with all the extra packages I&#039;m receiving, maybe I should make a small deposit into the karma pool and I left $10 with a thank you note in my mailbox today.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using SR for over 6 months now, and as the months keep piling on, and the packages keep coming in, the chances keep increasing that my mailman might notice that I receive more packages (and many from strange places) than anybody else he delivers to. So hopefully, this little token to show that I appreciate him will help him shrug his shoulders and ignore his intuition should that happen.<br /><br />So, fellow citizens of SR...I urge you to consider showing a little appreciation for your mailman this holiday! Even outside of the special circumstances here, it&#039;s the right thing to do.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!

				The same thought occurred to me a couple days ago; definitely a good idea and may encourage their letter carrier to look the other way if they notice something.<br /><br />

				I always show appreciation for my mailman.....been doing that for years.&nbsp; &nbsp;And you know what?&nbsp; &nbsp;I get excellent service all year long.&nbsp; &nbsp;I never even have to worry about signing for anything cause my postal carrier already automatically signs for anything needing a signature and leaves it for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a concern so much on SR because most pkgs sent DO NOT need a signature but still it&#039;s nice to not have to worry....or EVER go down to the post office.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Take care of your mailman cause they really do take care of you too.

				Bumping this topic because this very thought occurred to me today.&nbsp; Did a search to make sure I wasn&#039;t the first.&nbsp; <br /><br />My parents always did it, but I haven&#039;t thought about it since.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;ve been on SR, I realize how vital that guy is in this whole thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Give em some holiday cheer!&nbsp;
