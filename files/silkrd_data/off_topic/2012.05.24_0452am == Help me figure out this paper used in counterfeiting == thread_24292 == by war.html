				Don&#039;t have a need to actually get counterfeit money, my connect has been legit with me for a while now.&nbsp; Anyways, when I get bills from them I am basically getting real bills.&nbsp; Of course there are duplicate serial numbers but the paper feels EXACTLY the same.&nbsp; My supplier has told me they inject their paper with gelatin but I am not convinced.&nbsp; Does anyone else think there may be a way to actually just buy the same/near same paper the government uses?&nbsp; I am almost positive that the paper is really not that hard to duplicate but by the government telling people that the paper is near impossible to duplicate no one has really tried?&nbsp; Im weird like that.<br /><br />Any ideas/discussions?&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve heard you can bleach out the ink on small bills and print over it higher denotations.

				The paper is made from fibers of cotton and other materials of that kind. <br /><br />Gelatin? I call horse manure.<br /><br />Dank

				The paper the bills come on is cotton fiber paper but supposedly injected with gelatin.&nbsp; I am 100% sure that it is possible to duplicate US Bank Note paper all the way (hell I have seen it done) but I am just having trouble figuring out how my supplier does it.&nbsp; Its definitely not the bleached bill method.&nbsp; Way too time consuming.

				I believe real US banknote paper has red and blue fibers sprinkled randomly throughout. You can see them with a magnifying lens. Then of course there is the watermark and the microfiber with the bill denomination. And as others have said , its made of cotton and other fibers , not wood pulp like most commercial paper.
