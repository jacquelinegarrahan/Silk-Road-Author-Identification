				We all agree it would be sweet, I think what makes it sweeter is that in a way its like some of us have known each other for ages. We dont know what we look like, or the sounds of our voices. We could walk past each other in the street and never know. But some of us really feel something for others. We care about one and other. We would help if we were in trouble.&nbsp; It would be like meeting up with someone you missed for ages but couldnt see. Immense lol.
