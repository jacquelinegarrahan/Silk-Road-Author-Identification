				What do you think will happend ?? If we all die we should make Party&nbsp; 24/7 now. Don´t care about wasting money for drugs &amp; hooker, health &amp; Drug addiction ...&nbsp; Only 200 Days from now until 21st December, 2012<br /><br />What do you think will happend this day ? Please explain ...<br /><br />1.Nothing<br /><br />2.We all die at 21st December, 2012<br /><br />3.Some Alian´s&nbsp; with hugh genitals on their arms will come and rape our rektums until we bleed out (ouch ..)? (Bad idea- I had this vision/bad dream on a LSD Flashback - Result of some of my old drug experiments in the late 90´s ....)<br /><br />4. ?????<br /><br />Wiki:<br />&quot;An Apocalypse (Greek: “lifting of the veil” or “revelation”) is a disclosure of something hidden from the majority of mankind in an era dominated by falsehood and misconception, i.e. the veil to be lifted.&quot; — Wikipedia<br /><br />&quot;Both the Hopis and Mayans recognize that we are approaching the end of a World Age... In both cases, however, the Hopi and Mayan elders do not prophesy that everything will come to an end. Rather, this is a time of transition from one World Age into another. The message they give concerns our making a choice of how we enter the future ahead. Our moving through with either resistance or acceptance will determine whether the transition will happen with cataclysmic changes or gradual peace and tranquility. The same theme can be found reflected in the prophecies of many other Native American visionaries from Black Elk to Sun Bear.&quot;<br /><br /><br />More info here:&nbsp; http://www.december212012.com/

				The Mayans didn&#039;t predict it as the end of the world. That date is the date their long count calendar which runs from 0 to 13000 resets to zero.<br />But the Mayans didn&#039;t account for leap year like our calendar, their agricultural calendar was strictly 365 days. We account for leap year, so technically this reset has already happened many years ago... <br /><br />I call bull shit on all those judgement day/apocalypse predictions, related to this or not...<br /><br />but I will certainly party my tits off on Dec 12!

				It is a bunch of bulls ass. At the most we are going into the time of Aquarius and leaving the era of Pisces. The Earth is a living being itself and it goes thru changes. We as humans are evolving. The universe is going into a new cycle but that don&#039;t mean that time is coming to an end. There may be a few natural disasters and such but we will survive it.<br /><br />The closer we get to that date the more you will see people trying to gain from it just like y2k. Did anybody really expect all the computers to shut down? I know I didn&#039;t. There were people selling bomb shelters. People who bought them filled them full of can goods and toilet paper. The same thing will probably happen. Right now is a good time to put up a website selling a half assed bomb shelter for thousands of dollars. Seriously if you can get a rich guy like a hollywood actor to pay you 100 grand for your bomb shelter, then you can take some of that money and rent a back hoe and dig a hole in his yard. then put together some type of metal building with toilets and water, electric, and whatever. You can get them to keep shelling out money for further needs and wotnot. Then bury it. Come buy some bit coin and get fucked up from that money.<br /><br />What do you think?

				The Maja´s were clever people and Nostradamus also, so im sure something will happend, but im not sure what.<br />Both forecast the same date of doomsday, but they lived in a diffent centurys. That´s why i think something must happend.<br />If nothing is happend at&nbsp; ‎21st December, 2012 im realy getting pissed and frustrated. I want some action ...<br /><br />I think the Flashback of my LSD Trip can become true ... but i hope not. <br />watch:<br />http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/germankraut1/1348253a.gif<br />http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/germankraut1/afe1b7fa.gif<br />http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/germankraut1/a5f422cd.gif<br />http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/germankraut1/906d918d.gif<br />http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/germankraut1/68d40dff.gif<br />http://i1224.photobucket.com/albums/ee371/germankraut1/249cde05.gif

				Although I&#039;m British, I do enjoy studying American History. <br /><br />This talk puts me in mind of New England&#039;s &quot;Dark Day&quot; on May 19th 1780. A combination of thick fog and ash from forest fires plunged New England into darkness and many people in the Connecticut State Council wanted to stop proceedings as they believed it Judgment Day. One of the members Abraham Davenport famously said:<br /><br />&quot;I am against an adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause of an adjournment: if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty.&quot;<br /><br />Amen to that!<br /><br />V.

				So the Mayans can predict the end of the world, but couldn&#039;t predict the much sooner downfall and destruction of their own civilisation? Something isn&#039;t right there.<br /><br />The only way something will happen is by self fulfilling prophesy. &quot;Oh the world is changing, consciousness is changing because its 2012.&quot; Therefore consciousness changes. <br /><br />But other than that, I&#039;ll see you, rocking a BITCH of a hangover, on the morning of the 22nd, spliff in hand.&nbsp;

				Hmm...I guess getting very drunk with the people you love is a good idea.<br />If the world ends the day after, you get no hangover.<br />If you have a hangover, HOARY the world is still here.<br />Win/Win...(Although I would take the hangover over death 9 times out of 10)

				Was watching a documentary on the Mayans on the Smithsonian channel a few weeks back and they talked about how Mayans would play this hybrid soccer type game (except you had to use your body, no feet or hands) but they would drug themselves first by wrapping tobacco up into sticks and ramming it up their asses, inducing a tobacco OD via assrod.<br /><br />So ... I&#039;m a bit skeptical of a culture that finds this enjoyable as their pastime.

				Recently a more accurate translation of the Mayan calendar was found that proved this whole 21.12.2012 stuff is bullshit. The Mayan calendar predicts the world will go on for many thousands of years after that.<br /><br />Link below:<br /><br />http://news.sky.com/home/strange-news/article/16225983

				i was sick of hearing about this in 2007.<br /><br />please people, can we all make a pact that after this we will stop with the &quot;end of the world&quot; prophecies?&nbsp; yes, the sun will burn out some day or something like that but it won&#039;t be for a long long long time.<br /><br />i get it, we all want the world to end.&nbsp; that way we wouldn&#039;t have to face death alone and we could all stop worrying about the worlds problems, but this is a fantasy.&nbsp; these end of the world scares are counter productive to progress.<br /><br />please, after this one just stop.&nbsp; i&#039;m begging you all.
