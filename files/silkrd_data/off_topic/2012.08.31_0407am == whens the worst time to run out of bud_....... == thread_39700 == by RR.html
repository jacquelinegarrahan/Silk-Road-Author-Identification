It&#039;s rough trying to stretch what little money I can get right now.<br /><br />Hopefully soon I can get unemployment or something to help out.<br /><br />I feel like a fucking potato sitting here with no smoke, so I would love to get even shitty hash or something to get me moving.

I miss my weed&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />After smoking multiple times every day for the past 4 years it&#039;s making me so depressed that I can&#039;t just toke up and I&#039;ve been getting agitated so easily. It&#039;s been about 2 weeks now and I don&#039;t even know what to do with myself when I&#039;m not job hunting.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i do feel for you man, i have the same issue when i run out or the postman takes the piss, if i dont smoke i have absolutely no motivation at all, i just sit around doing fuck all, but as soon as i smoke a spliff my mind comes alive again, i start to think about things that need doing, its like mind fuel to me, god id get nothing done if i couldn&#039;t smoke, i hope you find a job soon man, when times get tough for me i switch to cheap hash, its not ideal but its better than fuck all, you can pick soap bar crap up dirt cheap just about anywhere in the uk, its flooded with the shit. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You got any recommendations for vendors on the road? I don&#039;t find it worth it to buy around here anymore and I don&#039;t know anyone that sells hash. I&#039;m just doing odd jobs for people and selling shit off to pay bills and hopefully get some extra $$ for some bud or something. It&#039;s rough trying to stretch what little money I can get right now.<br /><br />Hopefully soon I can get unemployment or something to help out.<br /><br />I feel like a fucking potato sitting here with no smoke, so I would love to get even shitty hash or something to get me moving. I find myself just wanting to fall asleep staring at the computer screen.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />my go to guy on here is No Sticks No Seeds, he has the best bud i have had of there since amsterdam shop diapered, and what a selection this guy has, all types of bud from amnesia haze to blue cheese ive got some amnesia lemon at the minute and some blue cheese and blue mammoth on the way, i have done a couple of reviews on the uk weed thread over in rummer mill, have a look, hes super amnesia haze is more like a tranquilizer than weed, thats some strong stuff, i have smoked for years and years but i nearly whited of one spliff man, spins you out to fuck.&nbsp; &nbsp;
