				OK so on another place i hang out we have a &quot;vent thread&quot; so thought i would start something similar over here!<br /><br />customer buys product today - customer lives in country i require him to finalize as mentioned in my profile - customer finalizes but leaves feedback bitching about this - I tell him he should not have ordered if he did not agree with finalizing early - customer then questions why my refund policy is only 25% and tells me it should be 50% - I tell customer again if he was not happy with my terms he should not have ordered, I explain why i offer 25% &amp; not 0% (not that i should need to explain) then I ask customer if he wants his BTC back.<br /><br />this is just one of the many annoyances I&#039;ve had to deal with today, still smiling though :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				(this isn&#039;t related to your post but I thought that I&#039;d point it out)<br /><br />GreenGiant. When I went to your vendor page from your link in your sig, it told me that you have been a member of SR for 42 years, and you were last seen on Sr 42 years ago. Made me lol.

				none of the numbered user id urls work anymore... all user id are now hash codes<br /><br />awesome freaking post DA, nearly brought a tear of union and pride for the community<br /><br />GG, sorry to hear about your encounter with the unfortunate kind. I agree it is pompous and arrogant to assume a vendor&#039;s rules do not apply to one, simply given the fact one thinks one is established enough to be above such requirements. That is some BS someone then left negative feedback probably just cause one was too lazy and irresponsible to read all of your profile.&nbsp; And then to try and tell you how to run your business and what refunds to offer!? Certainly a buyer I would not want to deal with if I was a vendor
