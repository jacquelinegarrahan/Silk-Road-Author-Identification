				Hello, <br /><br />I &quot;occasionally&quot; do meth.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried VMM meth on SR (it was pretty damn goood, a pity he screwed everything up and left).&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a few questions that I would like meth users to answer.&nbsp; (Please, no shitty articles from google about how bad meth is).&nbsp; <br /><br />1) Who sells meth that&#039;s similar to VMM quality? <br />2) my &quot;addiction&quot; increases every time I do meth.&nbsp; I usually put a good 2-4 weeks in-between binges but it seems like every time I get back to it, it&#039;s a higher dose, and longer binge (regardless of the time put in-between).&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this? <br /><br />3) my MAIN question is, is there a such this as an &quot;occasional user of meth&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />From reviews on other forums, people say &quot;there is no such thing as an occasional user.&nbsp; There are those that do it, those that do it and then can&#039;t access more, and those that don&#039;t do it at all&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I, personally, believe this is bullshit and there can, in-fact, be occasional users of meth.&nbsp; <br />Opinions? <br /><br />(I think the media falsely demonizes every drug there is.&nbsp; Especially since I never feel any &quot;bugs&quot; crawling on my skin that I see in the anti-meth ads).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I occasionally use meth and though I can control myself I have to say I do find myself really looking forward to the next time I can use it. I limit myself to a quarter gram a month so I can&#039;t do any big binges - if I want it to last the month I have to be sensible. <br /><br />But to be honest, I can own meth and not touch it until the time is right whereas with regular amphetamine or cocaine I find it incredibly hard not to use all the time. I feel that meth instantly gets me where I wanna be whereas with weaker stimulants I&#039;m constantly chasing a high that I never get after the first dose. I find it extremely hard to resist and otherwise I have very good self restraint. <br />After meth I feel really exhausted and actually have no desire to do anymore. It is a great ride but I&#039;m glad it&#039;s over ...... <br /><br />I can&#039;t wait till the next time I can do it, but I have no trouble controlling my cravings until my arranged meth-time. But time will tell I suppose&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Though it is probably good to note that I feel this with MDMA as well and I know some people become very compulsive with MDMA.<br />

As a young teenager, I would go on binges for weeks at a time sometimes. Sometimes I wouldn&#039;t touch it for months. When I moved to a foreign country just before high school and no longer had access to it, I stopped for a couple years(in my hometown, heavy narcotics are far easier to come by than &#039;soft&#039; drugs like weed, not to mention much, much cheaper. You can either get kinda stoned for a while, or get smacked the fuck up for a few days), tho I was doing plentiful other things in the meantime, and to be honest, I probably could&#039;ve found a supplier but just wasn&#039;t that bothered really.<br /><br />When I started visiting my hometown after the first two years solid of being away, again I started binging occasionally. Really only buying a bag here and there when I either had the sudden urge, or when opportunity and mild urges coincided. There have been many a time when I was offered some and turned it down, even to watch my friends do the whole bag in front of me. No urges. Once I start, however, I don&#039;t like to stop for a while. So it&#039;s probably a good thing that it&#039;s not physically addictive.<br /><br />Cannabis is probably the most psychologically addictive thing I&#039;ve ever tried(or tried to quit (successfully once, for nearly 4 years)). And I used to do heroin.. Although, alcohol and tobacco are probably worse, I can get along just fine without either (as long as I have an alternative) so they don&#039;t count for me. So, Sideshow Bob.. I would like to confirm that there CAN exist such a thing as an occasional meth user. For serious.<br /><br />Hope this helped.. Doubt it, but I tried.<br /><br />konfustikate.<br />&nbsp;:) :D :)) ;D

				i used to be an occasional meth user.&nbsp; then i literally started having dreams about doing meth and would wake up practically salivating over a bump, and unable to fall back asleep because i was so excited for the upcoming rave at which i would do meth.&nbsp; then i started using it just on the weekends.&nbsp; then it was just a little bump before class.&nbsp; then it was another bump after class.&nbsp; then it was every day for a week.&nbsp; then i quit.<br /><br />it was fun while it lasted, but in my case, i could not maintain status as an occasional user.&nbsp; to me, it just felt way too fucking good and way too powerful for me to regulate.

				I find that the older I get, the less I tolerate having to recover from these escapades.. what used to be just a lazy morning, or even day, in bed has turned into two or three days in bed and the rest of the week feeling like roadkill. And the binges are getting shorter and shorter. Never more than a few days, the last less than 48 hours. So I guess all signs are pointing to an eventual permanent abstinence. I really can&#039;t imagine myself at 60 (or even 50 for that matter), and what..? going on meth-fuelled knitting marathons? Somehow, I just don&#039;t see it.<br /><br />That being said, I do know a few sexagenarians who enjoy their uppers the way I love my dissociatives and downers. Very occasionally and much more discreetly so than myself. It can be done.. I guess it all depends on the nature of each individual to begin with. If you have an addictive personality, odds are.. you&#039;re going to get addicted. And, just because I more or less fell out of love with ice and can take it or leave it these days, that doesn&#039;t mean I haven&#039;t struggled with other substances. But if your binges are getting closer and closer together and/or lasting longer and longer each time, I&#039;d definitely say you need to take the advice offered by EzzeeK and set some limits. If you find yourself passing those limits and setting yourself some newer, more lenient ones. Straight away, that&#039;s a warning sign. As in STOP WHAT YOU&#039;RE DOING. And take it from someone who has been enjoying narcotics of each and every kind at each and every available opportunity for the last 17 years solid with only a couple weeks here or there, at the very most, completely sober(really not proud. actually quite appalled. this is the first time I&#039;ve really thought about it).. if you can stop yourself and stick to those limits, you&#039;ll probably be just fine so long as you stay disciplined. If you can&#039;t.. may WhateverHigherBeing/Power/Force/MythicalCreature/TrifectaYouBelieveCreatedTheUniverseAndAllThatItContains save you and/or your soul.<br /><br />Sorry to break it to you. But that&#039;s my honest truth, for all it&#039;s worth.<br /><br /><br />konfustikate<br />&nbsp;:) :D :)) ;D

				* DISCLAIMER: I&#039;m not trying to offend or judge anyone in any way. This is only a personal opinion. *<br /><br />Do not try to justify your desire to do more of this disgusting drug. There are a multitude of relatively less harmful ways to stimulate your body. You probably will not turn into one of those slack-jawed, rotten-toothed hillbillies from COPS, but you can be certain that in the long term, meth will greatly and negatively affect your though processes.<br /><br />I have seen people turn completely evil as the result of regular meth use. By my definition, regular use means more than once per month. Point number 2 in your post exhibits the trademark thought process of a soon to be tweaker who lies, steals, and cheats to find his or her next fix. Ask yourself this: &quot;Do the benefits of using meth (feeling on top of the world, being able to jack off or fuck for 12 hours straight) outweigh the drawbacks (crash, feening for more, feeling like shit when you&#039;re not on it, fucked up skin)?&quot;<br /><br />You seem like a smart guy. Stick to the basics and you&#039;ll be just fine. Be happy that you have tried meth and are lucky enough to still be in relatively good mental and physical health. Do not push it.<br /><br />Anyone who feels like flaming me for this can lick my fucking balls. I was a big time meth head for about a year. It never ends well. The big three (meth, coke, and heroin) only benefit one entity in the long term: the manufacturer. The regular user is simply a puppet on the manufacturer&#039;s string. Dance, puppet, dance!<br /><br />Do not let your body be a prisoner to any substance.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meth is the only stimulant i can enjoy. when i do it i never go on binges but smoke about 100mg in a night. im glad that stimulants aren&#039;t my thing because my uncle is a prime example of what every day meth use turns you into. he is 50 yrs old and a babbling idiot who is extremely paranoid and cant even talk properly. So in short, yes you can use meth recreationally on occasion. but it is easy to let it get out of hand and if you do let this happen the addiction has terrible effects on your physical and mental health. be safe, know your limits. honestly by the way you describe, it sounds like your setting yourself up for addiction.
