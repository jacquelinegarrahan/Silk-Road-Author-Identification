				So it was a casual discussion that turned into a heated political debate, but last night some of us were sitting around the bowl and the subject popped up! One of the dudes is a grower, who by the end of the 35 - 40 minutes of discourse, was ready to crush skulls (not ALL my doing either!) and another is actually involved in politics to a certain degree and he was adamant that grower was a tool of Tabbot propaganda.<br /><br />I started on the negative side, thinking that Grower was just being paranoid and why should it affect the price, but he&#039;d done his homework and by the end of it I was actually on his side.<br />I think, for whatever reason or motive, the cost of pot will likely go up in july, if not late june! I&#039;m not totally sceptical though, I&#039;m not as informed as I&#039;d like to be before taking a stand either side, I&#039;d like to know what other Aussies think!&nbsp; ???

				Carbon tax is a global scam that profits the middle men who broker the credits to corporations for a fee, the corps still produce the same amount of carbon emissions just they pay a bit extra and agree with each other to dump the extra costs on consumers. Nothing changes, just some credits broker makes a ton of money.<br /><br />If your Aussie grower isn&#039;t stealing power to grow wonder how he&#039;s not been caught yet. Nobody here grows and actually pays out to the hydro companies.. they&#039;d flag their accounts immediately and send the police to check the house out. Some guy with a bunch of aquariums was raided by the cops, assaulted, had tons of stuff stolen all because a hydro employee flagged his increased usage.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know how much truth this holds. I don&#039;t remember where I heard it or read it.<br />But if you own your own house, your not renting or leasing. LE are not allowed to look at your electricity consumption or bills as it is an invasion of privacy.<br /><br />- It does seem logical that if the cost of producing a product increases the cost to the consumer will also increase.<br /><br />Regardless, we need to work harder on getting this stuff legalized! <br />- Wouldn&#039;t having enormous outdoor grows work to offset carbon emissions at the same time being a multi million if not billion dollar industry providing more jobs and happiness for everyone. <br /><br />Fuck I hate the powers at will... Gillard that turkey giblet, monotone voiced, robotic fucking cunt. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

A 3 bedroom house (stock standard grower premises) using commercial quantities of metered power ALWAYS raises eyebrows. Network losses in many parts of suburban Australia are too large to calculate effectively (old and decrepid lines, substations and transformers) - though this is changing. Some of the money raised from exorbitant price hikes in electricity will be going to improving the network infrastructure.<br /><br />Oh, and if you believe a tax on &quot;Carbon&quot; will fix any perceived problem with CO2 or &quot;global warming&quot; you most likely have rocks in your head. It is merely another way of redistributing wealth... and taxing productivity.<br /><br />your friendly engineer,<br /><br />andyki
