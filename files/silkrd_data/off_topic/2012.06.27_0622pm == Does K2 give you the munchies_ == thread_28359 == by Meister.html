				Sometimes after a couple bowls of good old fashioned nugget I get a hankering for some Chinese takeout, but K2 must take it to another level.<br /><br />http://gawker.com/michael-terron-daniel/<br /><br />A 22-year-old Texas man was arrested yesterday for allegedly attacking a neighbor and eating his family&#039;s dog alive.<br /><br />Michael Terron Daniel was allegedly high on a designer drug known as K2 at the time and was said to be &quot;going crazy.&quot;<br /><br />Witnesses say Daniel informed residents at the Waco home where the incident took place that he was &quot;on a bad trip from ingesting K-2&quot; — a type of synthetic cannabis known to exacerbate existing psychoses — before getting down on his hands and knees and &quot;chas[ing] a neighbor while barking and growling like a dog.&quot;<br /><br />He then proceeded to beat and strangle the family dog before biting into it, &quot;ripping pieces of flesh away.&quot; The dog was later pronounced dead at the scene.<br /><br />According to Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton, officers arrived to find Daniel on the porch covered in blood. He asked the officers to fight him or use the stun gun &quot;to help him get off his bad trip.&quot;<br /><br />Daniel was charged with felony cruelty to a non-livestock animal and booked into McLennan County Jail where he remains.

				I thought this story was about MDPV/bath salts/LSD/MDMA/PCP/Heroin depending on who you ask? And I thought the dude ate another dudes face or something?<br /><br />These &quot;substance x causes man to eat disgusting thing y&quot; stories seem to have legs.<br /><br />Also, I see the humor value in your question, but serious answer, no synthetic cannabinoids never caused me to have weed munchies.

				There&#039;s been about 12 stories since the original bath salt zombie story. This one is the first of those I&#039;ve seen that actively calls out a specific synthetic cannabis, whereas the rest were mdpv bath salts that the journalists incorrectly inferred was a synthetic cannabis.<br /><br />The rest were like a guy biting another guys arm, shit like that, this ones legitimately frightening imagining a dude eating his dog ALIVE.
