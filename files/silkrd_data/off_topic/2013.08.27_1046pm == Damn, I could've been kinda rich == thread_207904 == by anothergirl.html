				After my yearly bout of drug tourism last year in which I purchased copious amounts of substances off SR to indulge in, I transfered my unspent bitcoins back to mtgox and left them there, knowing I&#039;d use them again this year.<br /><br />But, fearing the price fluctuation, I converted them back to my local currency.<br /><br />And now, as I gear up to once again travel to a legally more &quot;safe&quot; country and indulge in more new goodies, I realize that if I had not sold the bitcoins but left them as BTC, I would have made an insane amount of money as the price of BTC skyrocketed--enough to pay for all my drugs this time and still have about a quarter year&#039;s salary worth of cash left over.<br /><br />God damn it bugs me. Just like when I invested most of my life savings into an index fund right before the huge crash in 2008 to be responsible so I could afford rent and diapers when I get old (thinking the market hat probably bottomed out) and flushed half of it down the crapper.<br /><br />Shit. It sucks to be relatively poor.

				Yeah I feel ya there.&nbsp; Anyone who&#039;s been around long enough remembers how cheap bitcoin used to be.&nbsp; Bitcoin is like the stock market and the stock market is like gambling.&nbsp; And in gambling there&#039;s hindsight.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever bet sports you know there are those games that you have a lean on one side or the other but never pull the trigger.&nbsp; Then you&#039;re kicking yourself when the game is over and the side you were leaning towards cashes.&nbsp; You may have even bet on other games instead and lost.&nbsp; It is what it is.&nbsp; Just be thankful for what you&#039;ve got and try to make some money off this bitcoin wave right now.&nbsp; I&#039;m bullish on bitcoin and think it&#039;s going to take off here soon.&nbsp; Last night was a big jump and just yesterday I was on here posting about a big meeting bitcoin had with the feds.&nbsp; It might have had something to do with that.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t hurt that the Winklevoss twins (the ones who lost out to Marc Zuckerburg for facebook) who are millionaires are invested in bitcoin.&nbsp; They stand to gain a lot for the stability of bitcoin.&nbsp; Emphasis on stability.&nbsp; So yes bitcoin will go up and bitcoin will go down, but I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll ever see bitcoin sky rocket to hundreds of dollars just to plunge down to double digits overnight again like it did back in April.&nbsp; Bitcoin will steadily rise over time UNLESS government attempts to defeat it.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll do that.&nbsp; They&#039;ll accept it and find a way to tax the hell out of it as capital gains.&nbsp;

				I dont think govenments will accept it ever I think they will continue attempting to shut down as many services and sites related to the buy or sell of BTC they have even confiscated some off a guy in Merica because they linked him to this site like 11BTC they took (bet they sold them on localbitcoins then started following who they sold them oo cunts they are )

				I wont give specifics as I don&#039;t want people to recognise me.. but mid-late last year I won approx 2000 (yes 2000) btc on a gambling site I won&#039;t mention.. I had actually developed abit of an addiction (all though if your constantly winning is it an addiction :P) anywho.. so btc was about $15 back then.. so as you can imagine I thrilled to have won ~$30,000 worth of BTC. I stopped gambling immediately... 2 days later I bought about 250btc worth of gold.... 2 days later.. I had some ambien (stilnox here) and logged back onto gambling site. Within seconds I lost 200btc.. ( I was doing 1-200btc bets). no problem.. deposit 200 more.. lost it.. hmm better deposit 400.. within the space of 5 minutes I had lost all of it.. 1500btc :(<br />Interesting how gambling addiction is just like drugs.. first your bettting a couple of $&#039;s a round.. then a couple months later your making bets 1000x larger. <br /><br />I was pretty depressed for a while.. got over it.. until price got to $100/btc.... $250/btc was the rest killer :(<br />that would of been over like $350,000.. finally getting over that now :] Will haunt me forever... :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve done so much retarded stuff on ambien... &quot;accidently&quot; took 3x 1000ug 25i tabs... &quot;accidently&quot; took like 200mg mxe and went for a walk... bought so much crap I dont even want.. Now whenver I have ambien I make sure im out of drugs and stay to stay away from paypal.. you&#039;d think I&#039;d just stop taking the ambien.. but here we are

				No regrets, just the ups and downs of life.&nbsp; I have learned the value of a dollar/coinage the hard way.&nbsp; I still look back in amazement at the recklessness of my spending habits, but I had fun and you can&#039;t change the past.&nbsp; Just live and learn and be thankful that you had it to blow.

				With the benefit of hindsight it&#039;s easy to craft a scenario where one could have made a fortune. I do it myself. In respect to BTC had similar experience. First bought at $12 when joined SR. Over a month or two they moved to $27. At around this time I had access to sufficient funds to buy around 1000 but didn&#039;t, why? Because I never looked at the appreciating BTC as an investment, to me it was purely a means to fund SR purchases plus I always had a lingering fear of holding too many due to hacking and the ethereal nature of the digital currency. I mean who would have predicted the heights it achieved? Of course how many times I&#039;ve thought to myself, if only I&#039;d bought one thousand and sold then at the $280 high....trust me it&#039;s never that easy calling the top due to greed. But, did get to buy alot of SR merchandise for cheap in the lead up to the BTC bubble!
