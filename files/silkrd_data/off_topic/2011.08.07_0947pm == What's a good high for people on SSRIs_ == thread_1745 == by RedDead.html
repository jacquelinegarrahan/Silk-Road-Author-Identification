				I&#039;m looking for recommendations to expand my horizons.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />I&#039;ve learned from this forum that E will not have that much effect on me because I&#039;m on a SSRI. <br /><br />I&#039;m looking for something that:<br />1. is euphoric<br />2. will totally fuck me up. <br />3. you can take alone and not risk a bad trip<br /><br />Thanks in advance for the advice!&nbsp; :D

				methoxetamine should work, but don&#039;t qoute me on that.&nbsp; I was on SSRI&#039;s for awhile, and my research lead me to believe it is really seratonigens you have to worry about either not working or causing seratonin syndrome.&nbsp;

				yeah theyve just stuck me on an ssri (citalopram to be precise) cant say im a big fan, sat here teeth chattering like ive had a phat line of molly but with none of the good parts, and i did read that until i get off the damn things psychs are going to be off the menu (so im feeling i shant be on them long, soon as i spot something i want to try im scrapping the pills) but until then ive been looking into what opiates and benzos will be able to do for me, although i need to be careful with the benzos, fallen foul of them once before (between 7-9 days lost) im just not exactly sure which to go with though, and at the mo supplies in uk to uk form are rather slim, im after ritalin, oxycontin and some alprazolam but not in some absurd amount, just a few of each, pharma1 has amazing prices if i wanted a lot but i really can do without having that many laying around, if theyre there ill eat them.

				From what I&#039;ve read/experienced with SSRI&#039;s, in most cases they aren&#039;t worth the long term risk they have the potential to do. I was prescribed them once a long time ago, but since using benzos RESPONSIBLY I have no need for the SSRI. Maybe look into a benzo with very little recreational value? Lorazepam seems to do the trick for many.

				I take citalopram (SSRI) and clonzapam (benzo). The clonzapam doesn&#039;t work for me anymore but the anti depressants do. It works for me however I can&#039;t roll which sucks.

				Loraz is actually less potent than alpraz, and longer lasting. I can take .5mg and work and learn things without any problems. Don&#039;t even feel &#039;messed up&#039;, really. Just not anxious anymore.

				I have had this problem pretty much my entire life.&nbsp; There is no point wasting your money on any substance that mainly effects you serotonin, epinephrine, or nor-epinephrine levels.&nbsp; That pretty much rules out coke, ecstasy,&nbsp; many psychedelics, etc.....<br /><br />Opiates are the only answer i can rely on if i need a bit of stress relief.&nbsp; Other than that, I find if i know that i am going to party a certain day, I will start weaning off my meds a good 3 weeks before.&nbsp; Now as your doctor will tell you, that is highly not recommended due to the possibility of many bad things!

Can&#039;t speak on opiates as I&#039;m one of those rare people who doesn&#039;t get any euphoria\high from them, I only take them for pain.

				from my experience doctors often have little awareness of the drugs they prescribe and their affects, especially not the withdrawal affects (e.g. ssri&#039;s are known to cause suicidal ideation)<br /><br />benzos have many advantages, sure, but it&#039;s also really hard to wean off of them<br />just look at their adverse affects:<br />http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/<br /><br />my two pennies

				Once in the clearnet: http://biopsychiatry.com/index.html Dense reading that requires a lot of back-research to understand. Also, despite the name, look at www.amphetamines.com. There is way more there than you might think at first, just from the name.<br /><br />“A SSRI can be combined…with a dopaminergic such as methylphenidate”<br /><br />“…noradrenaline is essential to maintaining drive, vigilance and the capacity for reward. There&#039;s a fair bit of evidence that chronically depressive people have dysfunctional and atypical noradrenergic systems…”<br /><br />All highs come from increased dopamine levels. Some drugs increase production, others block reuptake, others free receptors so they&#039;re open only to dopamine. Most do a combination with one action predominating over others. You can do this without interference from the SSRI...but I&#039;m not saying take just anything that is dopaminergic! Only saying that there are plenty of ways to get the dopamine high on a SSRI. For sure there are wrong combinations.

				Why no coke and SSRI&#039;s? There is a bluelight thread saying lexapro and calexa are ok.

				Thanks for the thread! I had a really bad experience with rolls and ssri&#039;s. Kinda wish I knew this before. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m pretty sure all highs do not come from increased dopamine levels. That sounds like an oversimplification.

				I was doing coke when I started SSRIs and it sent me into a manic state for about a month, I didn&#039;t realize anything was wrong until years later I read about it online somewhere. I don&#039;t do coke anymore, I&#039;ve been smoking weed for 10 years on SSRIs with no problems.<br /><br />I just quit my SSRIs about a month ago, partly because they don&#039;t seem to help me anymore and I want to try all the LSD&#039;s that are for sale on SR. I just bought some 2C-B this weekend and my mind should be flushed of all SSRIs by the time I get it in the mail.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				^ Lol, nah nah nah. Getting off SSRI&#039;s is like any other drug. Its a bitch and you feel like shit if you don&#039;t take it during the time you should(My dad takes one every morning or he can&#039;t think at all). My dad has been on SSRI for about 2 years and he has done coke, shrooms, drinks, smokes(weed and cig), ketamine, mdma(felt really hungover next day though), mxe, nitrous, roxy, and any other drug that I and my friends get haha. all of these drugs except mdma worked and had no neg. effects :)<br /><br />
