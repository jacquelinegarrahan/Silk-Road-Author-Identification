				Title: <strong>Making DOC blotters</strong><br />

				Hello fellow silkroaders.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to make DOC blotters. I&#039;ve found that 300g/sqm aquarel paper should be the best for LSD, but will it be possible to fit 1.5mg of DOC on 1x1cm paper?<br />What is the best way to lay these papers? Dissolve DOC in acetone/ethanol and soak the paper in, then let it dry, or putting single drops directly onto paper? I&#039;m afraid that when I soak the whole paper in and let it dry, one side may have more of the chemical than other due to gravity.<br />Should I print something on these blotters or one colour is fine? Either white, or coloured with food grade colouring.<br /><br />Thanks for your insight

				DOC.HCl has much higher solubility in ethanol than acetone, you&#039;ll easily get 60mg in a ml of warm ethanol. Add 0.025 ml of this to each blotter square for 1mg/cm2 loading. Invest in a micropipette if you&#039;re doing this on a larger scale for accurate dosing, they&#039;re fairly cheap on ebay. <br />If you&#039;re just making them up for personal use, you can afford to spend more time preparing them so you can make up a 10mg/ ml solution and slowly add the solution dropwise to each blotter square, leaving the paper under a lamp between each application to dry. ethanol evaporates very quickly under a lamp. DOX&#039;s are stable to light so no worries about degradation. If you saturate your paper, capillary action will draw the solution up to the adjacent blotter squares and you&#039;ll get uneven dosing so make sure you wait for the paper to dry between applications. Don&#039;t soak the whole sheet, there&#039;s too many factors which will lead to wildly uneven doses.<br /><br />have made 25C-NBOMe blotters at 500ug/cm2 using this method.

				I&#039;ve got a micro-pipette, but it is too small for this :) It&#039;s for my personal and friends&#039; use for now, so I&#039;ll try to do it with a 0,5ml syringe. There are 0,05ml increments. Hopefully, the paper will absorb 0,05ml.

Especially considering how hardcore DOC is, it&#039;s a bad idea to lay it on paper that doesn&#039;t have &quot;DOC&quot; printed on it, or that isn&#039;t large.

I&#039;m making it for a close group of friends. I know they may pass it to someone else, but the pieces will be WHITE with nothing on it. Also, acid is never sold in 1x1cm squares, but in smaller ones<br />I thought printing DOC on them, but I have no idea if regular HP Ink is edible. If I find out it is, I will print DOC all over them, because I want no one to think it&#039;s acid. If the ink is non-edible, they&#039;ll stay white, as I said.
