				Unfortunately nobody is required to explain why they are giving someone negative karma. There&#039;s nothing you can do about it. I gave you +1 to keep it balanced, since you seem like a nice guy based on your posts.<br /><br />sdesu

Look at my score lol, plenty of people have given me bad Karma, but to be fair I can be quite cutting sometimes so swings and roundabouts. <br /><br />If people say things that vex me on here I dish out bad Karma without explaining it. If there is someone I don&#039;t like on here (and by that I mean Mister Dank) I give him bad Karma just because it brightens up my day lol. :P<br />
