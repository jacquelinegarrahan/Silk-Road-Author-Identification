				validate at a terminal means one in second life not a physical terminal, you need to setup a second life account, teleport your avatar to one of the virwox terminals and it will link your account after that you need never touch second life again. should you be in the eu you can also use paysafecard or ukash to do it, but its best to take that through an extra step (neteller) to get the best rate, here are the methods i know of so far and the rates:<br /><br />Cash&gt;paysafecard&gt;virwox&gt;BTC&nbsp; rate 20%<br />Cash&gt;paysafecard&gt;neteller&gt;virwox&gt;BTC&nbsp; rate 4.75%<br />cash&gt;ukash&gt;neteller&gt;virwox&gt;btc&nbsp; rate 4.5%<br /><br />there are also several dodgy looking russian exchanges that will convert paypal/ukash/paysafe to liberty reserve but again rates here are astronomical thing £1=$1.2LR considering the actual current rate of £1=$1.62 even if they dont just steal your voucher they are basically robbing you blind, the cheapest way is usually to do a bank deposit, the annoying thing here though is it takes some 3-4 working days to process (i still fail to understand why this is) <br /><br />also be aware virwox blatantly lie about their bitcoin withdrawal system, on the site it says &quot;payouts are usually processed instantly but a few are checked manually for security reasons&quot; those few are actually not a few but each and every single one, ive never had an instant payout once from them, at best hope for 24hours if its in the week, if you hit payout friday night then dont expect to see your coins till monday afternoon at least so as always plan well ahead, also be aware that virwox also only deal in whole bitcoins, not even a single decimal, so be prepared to have some sll left over in your account. it sure would be nice if there was somewhere that actually made it easy to buy btc. when virwox can accept paysafe and neteller bot that and ukash why isnt there somewhere just straight exchanging them for BTC at say a 5-10% fee youd make a mint <br /><br />there is also xmlgold who will exchange paysafe for LR but again dont expect great rates, in fact i have only seen a single site with a near reasonable rate and thats libery4ukash.com they offer £1=$1.4 but the site is arguably the dodgyiest looking of the ones ive found yet so the higher rate makes it even more suspect

				Cash&gt;paysafecard&gt;neteller&gt;virwox&gt;BTC&nbsp; rate 4.75%<br /><br />So I just take 4.75% of the amount of cash I&#039;m going to use, and add that number to my total so I can cover that rate, right? For example, if I used $30, I&#039;d have to have $31.42?

The aggravating problem with virwox is that you can&#039;t exchange directly but have to go via another virtual currency called LindenDollars. They&#039;re used in SecondLife, some simulation whatever.<br /><br />So you go Cash -&gt; LindenDollars -&gt; BTC<br /><br />it sucks really...
