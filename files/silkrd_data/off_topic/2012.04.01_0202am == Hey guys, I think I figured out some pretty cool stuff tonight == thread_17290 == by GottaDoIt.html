				So I want you to bare with me for a few moments now.<br /><br />I want you to imagine.<br /><br />Imagine the innocence of childhood and everything and anything that may entail for you as an individual to the moment you have reached in your life thus far.<br /><br />(please look beyond any grammar and/or spelling mistakes, language is created by people and thus cannot be right or wrong)<br /><br />Imagine standing in a very very long line (remember the innocence of childhood) you don&#039;t quite know what the line is for, but hey it must be something awesome to justify such a long line, right? You stand patiently in line, as you get closer rumors start to be overheard. Your anticipation grows and grows. This is amazing. This is going to be amazing. This is life changing. This is it. Any moment now. Closer and closer. Your life&#039;s anticipation has grown and accumulated to this very precise moment.. and.. it&#039;s begun. Silence. You&#039;re back in the real world but.. everything is the same.. but you notice that everything is kind of blue and red. Short moment of confusion, you feel something on your head, you place it in your hand and you&#039;re looking at one of those $2 plastic 3d glasses. You realize. It never existed. There was never anything there. You&#039;re scared. Confused. Upset. You&#039;re left clutching the $2 3d glasses, you know, you know it&#039;s worthless but you can&#039;t help it, you clutch onto it as if it&#039;s everything you got because, it is all you got. This worthless piece of mass produced nothingness. You think people are laughing at you but they&#039;re not, but they might as well be. The line is gone, the hopes and anticipation of the people you stood in line with are also gone, are they among the blank faces that walk on by without paying any attention to you? Maybe, maybe not, I don&#039;t know. Somehow I want this all to make sense but it doesn&#039;t.. it just doesn&#039;t. All that&#039;s left is the deep unrepairable void of nothingness.<br /><br />Oh hey look, it&#039;s 1 April, coincidence? I guess everything happens for a purpose..<br /><br />I hope some people write some things that will cheer me up tomorrow<br /><br />peace guys
