				Introduction: I&#039;ve only ever smoked decent weed once about 20 years ago and it was one hell of an experience, I had some super-skunk strain which gave a narcotic-type high. I had tried growing my own and also hash but both were pathetic by comparison to that skunk so I soon lost interest. Anyway after recently discovering SR I decided I would like to try some decent weed strains and last week plucked up the courage to order some for the first time from an overseas vendor (Baroso) as there was nothing decent local. <br /><br />What follows is my experience of first trying C99...<br /><br />Packed a bowl with a small nug on my little bong (it&#039;s one of those bottle-bongs..the type with a rubber bung that fits into a beer bottle).. weighed about 0.1-0.2g.. got a few hits and inhaled deeply. The high was a slow creeper and crept up after about 10-15 minutes I felt waves of pleasure which seemed to radiate up and down from the chest. The high was not as euphoric and pleasurable as the super-skunk experience, but definitely a real powerful high...I could tell it was more cerebral than physical strain, but there was plenty of physical too on the onset. <br /><br />Even though I was completely high as a kite I felt ok with myself with no paranoia etc so decided to out for an evening bike ride..Was -2C outside and I felt the cold on my ears and face but the cold didn&#039;t register as being that cold. hard to explain..I could feel its cold on my skin but not in a negative way, it&#039;s like I&#039;m seeing myself from third person like... hes cold, but your not... kinda thing.<br /><br />Oh man is this some trippy shit.. I&#039;m riding along and I&#039;m getting spacial distortions where my bike seems bigger than reality and I&#039;m seeing all different prospectives in detail in my mind, almost like split windows...can see part of my bike close up but like in animation form and then<br />I can see the road and things are mixing up between whats real and what isn&#039;t. I can see some people and as I zoom past I hear bits of their voices so clear in my ear and even after I&#039;ve past them.. its like I&#039;ve got super human hearing or for a moment my hearing is moved outside of my head and close to them. I can hear them better than normal and I can sense their moods. It feels exhilarating riding fast and I find myself laughing out loud. <br /><br />I&#039;m having some trouble with keeping straight and stuff but thats cool and I can go slower and then get my balance again. I&#039;m hearing my own thoughts as though a voice is speaking them to me in funny kind of way. It is like an external voice and it&#039;s in some weird movie-style saying different phrases. Like if I think, &quot;I need to go faster&quot; I hear this totally over the top American voice saying &quot;gooo faaaster&quot;. And I feel as though I&#039;m somewhere else too, my whole mood and mindset seems like I&#039;m in America and I&#039;m seeing images in my minds eye of people and places associated with America.<br /><br />I feel very good, happy and contented but also feel like I&#039;m in alternative reality that is an extension of old reality. I like this place a lot. Everything is enhanced and cooool.&nbsp; I feel this could help with anxiety which is something I suffer with. I go into a shop and I&#039;m feel quite ok and feel more inclined to smile and feel relaxed.<br /><br />Places I&#039;ve been before seem like I&#039;m seeing them through new eyes as new places. And some places I haven&#039;t seen before, I seem to have been there before. Like a strange sense of deja vu.<br /><br />Almost four hours later I&#039;m now on the sofa and still high and tripping slightly.. feeling very relaxed and normal aches and strains from my bad knee that would normally make sitting with my legs up uncomfortable, go unnoticed. I have some instant hot chocolate which tastes divine and settle down to watch my nightly episode of Dallas (maybe that&#039;s why my experience took on an Americana feel to it earlier) and felt drawn into it like I was among the actors, feeling and understanding their emotions and words in a much more insightful way. Like &quot;oh that&#039;s so neat, his thinking there is so logical..that is well written script&quot; <br /><br />I watched the sun go down and it seemed like minutes past in few seconds as suddenly the room became darker with a warm orange glow. Experiencing a great mellow tranquil peaceful feeling, like everything is beautiful and well in the world.<br /><br />I experienced a gradual comedown over the next hour and found myself back in my ordinary world and already missing and wanting to return to this nicer enhanced reality. The experience left me feeling a bit emotionally drained tho..I felt like this weed had opened up an area of my brain I don&#039;t use very often and expanded consciousness. I also felt a bit sick with a slight hangover feeling a few hours after the comedown..I&#039;m not sure&nbsp; if this was due to not being used to smoking and inhaling too much, or just the effects of the cannabis..&nbsp; It was only a slight uneasy feeling and eventually passed.<br /><br />Summary: This is some weird trippy shit!! I think it would be good to try some creativity on this like art or writing because I feel that side of the brain is totally unlocked.. as is the social and emotional side. This is definitely a &quot;get up and go&quot; weed, no couchlock, but saying that, it&#039;s equally good to take at the end of the day and just chill out with to some music videos or a movie, which I did on the second day and really had a fantastic night..music videos just seemed so much better and my imagination and creative thoughts were just running wild.<br /><br />Side note: I feel like this could be very very habit-forming! I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just this particular strain or weed in general, but I feel the urge to keep using it every day and be high constantly. I noticed if I smoke it twice in one day, the second time is not as good as the first.. I don&#039;t like smoking and gave up the habit of smoking cigarettes many years ago. I don&#039;t mind using it daily or more regularly but I&#039;d like to try some way of extracting the good stuff into oil/butter or maybe even making a cannabis tincture with alcohol.

				Nice man, glad to hear you had a great time.<br /><br />On a side note: FUCK I wish weed could still get me that high.&nbsp; Smoking medical strains almost daily for years tends to do something to your tolerance. <br /><br />And yeah, it can be habit forming and the first smoke of the day is always the best.

				Heh, glad someone enjoyed reading my wacky report. I forgot to mention this stuff doesn&#039;t smell too strong, quite muted...it&#039;s not a pungent smell like skunk with the giveaway &quot;burning rubber&quot; smell. My neighbour smokes that and it stinks out the whole building!&nbsp; Smell even comes in my apartment. <br /><br />I&#039;m quite sensitive to drugs in general being a super-lightweight things tend to hit me hard, even 2 or 3 beers has me totally drunk (not that I can tolerate alcohol anymore sadly..get instant hangovers&nbsp; :().&nbsp; <br /><br />Well I&#039;ve smoked C99 a couple more times since the report and it didn&#039;t hit as high but I didn&#039;t inhale so much my lungs are a bit tender from the first time! Anyway I&#039;m gonna heed the warnings about overusing and daily use...don&#039;t want to lose the magic so maybe limit to 3x a week and/or takes weeks off or something. I discovered a cool thread on a uk420* discussing adding weed to chocolate. Sounds like a cool way to take it! Will have to give it a try and see how it goes..anyone else tried that? <br /><br />* http://www.uk420.com/boards/index.php?showtopic=269851&amp;st=0<br />

				Introduction:<br />This is a follow-up experience that happened this weekend and I guess you could describe it as a train-wreck disaster! It&#039;s quite a long ramble and may be boring or silly in places but I thought I&#039;d post it up anyway it may give some of you a laugh. <br /><br />Ok firstly let me start by saying I&#039;m totally high as a kite as I type this so expect things to get a bit sketchy.<br /><br />I decided to get mashed up proper and so loaded up a fresh bowl and inhale for as long as possible. I had cleaned the bong out first and discovered the tube was blocked - no wonder I hadn&#039;t been getting very good draws. Anyways now it was clear as a whistle so I got plenty more than I bargain for and the top and bottom of it is, I got mashed off my face. I mean proper mashed. The high came on much quicker than previous and more intense. I knew that&#039;s a good sign but also a bad sign that I underestimated what I was getting into it. And sure enough I didn&#039;t have to wait long to have it confirmed.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />The high was just too much and I felt like my heart and brain were going to explode..my vision was totally screwed..blurry and not able to read or even see straight. I grabbed a pen and pad and managed to scribble down this to try and sum up how I was feeling:<br /><br />&quot;My head feels like a giant lump of lead caught between gigantic opposite magnets.&quot;&nbsp; :o<br /><br />It felt like an uncontrollable force in my head swirling around. Scary. I had trouble standing up and expected a seizure or stroke any minute. Felt I was on the edge of a full blown panic attack or something, but I was in control still just about and tried to reassure myself to calm down and the feeling would reduce.. But it kept building and I was getting shaky and very unsteady, room was spinning..then I closed my eyes and I imagined I was in some other place.. and that&#039;s when it occurred to me I could control this big force in my head and channel it into mental energy through thoughts and imagination. So I started using my imagination and thinking all kinds of things...it sounds insane, but I was able bring my imagination to almost a lucid dreaming-like state, where imagined things were so lucid that felt real. I started getting some sexy thoughts and channeled energy into that which proved a good distraction from the dire situation I was in..before long I had to go off and relieve myself and that sent me totally over the edge.&nbsp; :P Bad idea. It just re-established and intensified the overwhelming high that was now felt like it was tugging at the core of my very being. Some weird de-personalisation flashes were coming and with such intensity that I felt sure I would be going offline and passing out at any second.&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to take 0.25mg Xanax to calm things down but I know I&#039;m going to have to wait 10-15 mins for that to kick in.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-\<br /><br />So I&#039;m talking to myself and babbling all kinds of weird shit to try and distract myself a bit from the weird head throbbing pulsating waves in and out of reality which is almost unbearable and getting nauseating. I try and grab something to record it with. After having the batteries fail on 4 different devices and believing its a bad omen&nbsp; ??? I finally grab a camera, aim it at myself and start talking. The camera provides a reassuring distraction or grounding and it certainly takes my mind off feeling on the edge of another panic attack.<br /><br />About 20 minutes later I&#039;m lying down and feeling a bit more in control and still talking into the camera and the battery is about to run on that. I feel scared to be without the camera as it&#039;s become reassuring to have it there and talk into it. When it ran out I got a mini disc recorder with an external mic and started talking into that.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting all kinds of great insights into my course work, business, and life in general, so I wanted to try and record as much as possible. I wonder how crazy I might sound talking to myself. But then I figured is it so crazy? its only verbalising thoughts after all! Like reading to oneself aloud.<br /><br />After 40 minutes or so later I&#039;m feeling much calmer and back in control. The high has come way down and was just a nice comfortable enhanced mental function and some physical comfort (opiate style), but no euphoria. It&#039;s like a very clear head space... I&#039;m totally rooted and thinking about my life, how I use my time and planning for the future. Solutions to problems come really easy and my brain just seems to love logical thinking. I hear myself saying stuff, &quot;every action has an equal and opposite action... warmer means less cool...lighter means less dark&quot;.<br /><br />I began to think about the narrow sightedness of companies and industries, how for example, oil companies think they are in the oil business and not the energy business..or how Ford Cars only thought of themselves as a mass producer of cars and not a transport company. Setting themselves up to fail in effect.. or with a built-in obsolescence. Why spend all their energy and marketing on a product and mass producing it as cheap as possible? They don&#039;t focus on the customer or the market and so when the market changes, perhaps from new products or changing customer needs, they&#039;re out of step with the market and their product is obsolete. It occurred to me this is why the economy has cycles in industries of rapid growth and then slow growth or no growth, then shrinking and contracting...Companies ride high on the rapid growth and expect it to continue and then people panic and seem all surprised when the market collapses..its perfectly logical and normal. It&#039;s not the market as a whole, its just the specific product life cycles within the market. The customers are still there but their needs have changed is all and new markets emerge to serve their needs. Companies have to be dynamic and changeable to the customers needs if they&#039;re to survive these constant market cycles. Growth would then be more sustainable long term. I began to think about investing more of my money as I calculated I only have 2% of my capital invested. I realised the reason its so low is due to fear of risk. Then I heard myself saying (in a German-American accent - Albert Einstein style) &quot;it&#039;s relative my friend, it&#039;s relative.. risk and reward are opposite sides of the same coin.. you cannot have one without the other. They are proportionate. The more risk you take the more reward you receive. Risk should be measured in time not money. Because time is the cost of risk. It&#039;s measured in time. Time is the most valuable commodity of all, because its in such limited supply. Sure you can buy some extra time, but you can&#039;t regain your own lost time.&quot;&nbsp; :o<br /><br />My recorder cuts out and so I go take a relaxing bath. By the time I come out I&#039;m even more focused and ready to work on my studies, I feel my brain is now in a great learning mode ready to soak up knowledge. It occurred to me that so many health problems can be fixed by weed. There are now so many strains which have such precise effects that you can practically find weed to treat any of the common health conditions and find some relief in your health or life. If we started using weed like this, half the pharmacy industry would disappear and imagine the billions and billions we would save as a society? I consider my own situation.. I&#039;ve been plagued by Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for 2 years and nothing has shifted it or helped.. except weed. I feel energised and mentally clear again. I&#039;m pretty sure people would be a lot better off using a natural plant product too rather than popping pills with uncertain long term consequences, even if they are &quot;genetically engineered&quot; strains of weed for specific effects. It&#039;s crazy really, but that&#039;s the strange world we live in where these illogical rules we don’t really understand only make sense to those who make them in the first place. <br /><br />I swear my studying has improved loads when I tried studying yesterday on weed. Although I was slower reading and had to read sentences twice due to difficulty with sensory input..once I read it, I was able to understand stuff very easily and quickly with a much deeper understanding than I would normally. I found myself reading then putting my book down and able to scribble down enlightening examples very quickly applying logical reasoning to what I&#039;d read. I&#039;m thinking my notes are be gonna be profound insights for use in my tutor forums, but then maybe it won&#039;t seem so in the cold light of day.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />The munches strikes again... Full on munches this time. I&#039;m into everything from soggy muesli to hot potato cake and then toast with sliced banana and maple syrup on. Maple syrup! Only discovered it recently. Mmmmm. Where you have been all my life? Doesn&#039;t get much better does it? Suddenly I realise the floury dry potato cake is maybe not such a good idea with cotton mouth and I find myself almost choking on it and nearly having a panic attack again. I ponder for a few moments what a senseless death it would be dying on a piece of potato cake. <br /><br />Suddenly I see a pretty girl from the window and begin singing my own unique version of Neil Sedaka&#039;s Calender Girl song. I&#039;m pleased to say the young lady who was the object of my affections is long out of ear shot thankfully and I don&#039;t think my neighbours can hear me (at least I hope not).&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This was one hell of a scary experience and I nearly freaked out and wondered if I might have to call an ambulance. Thank god I had Xanax on hand. It just shows that if you&#039;re not used to smoking weed and don&#039;t fully understand the strain you&#039;re smoking and your own limits, you can find yourself totally overdoing it. The problem was I hadn&#039;t cleaned my bong and so the highs I got before were only a fraction of what I would normally be getting I think. After I cleaned it I smoked hard as usual and it was just too much. Well lesson learned I won&#039;t make that noob mistake again. I think you have to treat proper weed strains like pill drugs really and use with caution and respect. Take a little, see how it feels, then wait and add more if you need to. Just like swallowing pills, you can&#039;t take undo it once you&#039;ve overdosed..

				Oh wow, those were amazing reads, haha. I tried this last night and just read yours now. I wish I had read it before. I was expecting a mellow high, but this was far more extreme. It felt so trippy like yours and I remember having that cold field around me, instead of in my body. I didn&#039;t go outside like yours though, I couldn&#039;t keep my balance and just wanted to lie down, so I put an album on and lay down. It felt incredible for an hour and I gradually came down after 2 hours. The music seemed to be beating in time with my body and the dynamics were moving like a tide through the room. I&#039;m not an experienced smoker by any means but a joint of this got me off my face. This is Baroso&#039;s strain before he closed, which is a shame as I would be a regular customer with a product like this.

				Hi all, well it&#039;s been almost 2 months since I wrote those initial reviews and I still have a fair bit of that C99 left&nbsp; ;D The highs are not as powerful as the first few times, so I guess some who said it was because I hadn&#039;t smoked for 20 years were right. Saying that, I have been taking benzos a bit lately and I find taking those mutes the high from anything. The C99 is still very good shit anyway and has a permanent place in my med cabinet ;-) I like how I can study and work better on it, plus the creativity side. <br /><br />I experimented with extracting the THC so I don&#039;t have to smoke.. I found Ghee (clarified butter) works well, which I added to chocolate for easy storage and dosing. After a bit of experimenting I managed to perfect a method which takes 2 hrs to make a batch... the high is just as good and almost identical to smoking it, but comes on slower. <br /><br />I noticed someone mentioned Baroso has closed up shop... I hope not for good? That would be a real shame if its true because he&#039;s one of the sellers you can rely on for quality weed and good service.. I wanted to place regular orders with him and try some other strains&nbsp; :-\

				Another little experience/rambling on C99 from yesterday I thought I&#039;d share...<br /><br />I been feeling a bit down today. Both mood and energy wise..the old CFS symptoms returning, lethargy and flu-like feeling.. I&#039;m trying to study as I have an important exam coming up so decide I need a pick me up. First thought was poppy tea or tramadol, but these tend to make me edgy and nauseous so I decided better of it and decide to light up instead. Rolled a joint with C99 and some dried Salvia divinorum leaf which makes a nice tobacco sub. Salvia divinorum leaf is a real nice smooth smoke by itself and has some mild relaxation and a slight psychoactive vibe (nothing like the extracts). With C99 it seems to heighten the trippy effects a bit. So I had a nice relaxing smoke in the spare dimly lit room among some boxes. I decided to stay there as I was getting into a good place mentally. I could feel my worries and stresses melting away and the low mood I had earlier was replaced with a happy, positive feeling. About 5-10 minutes passed when suddenly a pulsating high hit me..woah where did that come from?..very nice! Glad I didn&#039;t take the opiates. This feels very nice and I&#039;m still fully functional. I get up and come into the next room and my perception has changed. Everything seems brighter, sharper and from a slightly higher angle. I feel very relaxed still and ready to study. But first I need to EAT. Munchies.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />As I&#039;m making some soup I see two little girls snuck between two sheds out front with cigarettes. As they&#039;re barely out of diapers I&#039;m assuming they are candy cigarettes. Little girls pretending to be moms. But no. I see a cloud of smoke above the elder ones head who must be all of 9. Her partner in crime, who is knee-high to a grasshopper (about 7 I&#039;m guessing) drops her cig and re-lights off the older girls while standing on tip toes and holding her cheek to steady her. Bless them. I guess we all been there. This is the second time I&#039;ve seen them, and on both occasions after coming back from the shops so I&#039;m guessing one of the older kids he helping them get them. Where these tiny tots get the money for ciggies is anyone guess. Perhaps they mugged some old lady or raided big sis&#039;s purse. Sad to see them taking up such a nasty habit at such an early age. They have no idea what they&#039;re letting themselves in for. They were even dolled up with heavy makeup and the 9 year old wearing clothes much too growm up for her. All they need now is the 4 kids and welfare giros. Christ, can&#039;t kids just enjoy being kids these days before they have to grow up.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />My homemade vegetable soup with a thick slice of wholemeal tastes divine. Haven&#039;t had any bread for a few days so it&#039;s especially nice. The more I eat the more pleasurable it is.<br /><br />Yeah man, this C99 is just the ticket as a medinical herb. Definitely picks you up and energises. Only problem is slight tendency to draw you towards pleasure enhancing activities and I need to STUDY. Well learning new things can be pleasurable too I guess..but not this course I&#039;m doing, gaining knowledge HURTS when you have to figure shit out. That&#039;s where C99 helps.. it just opens up the new areas, higher regions of the brain it seems..I&#039;m definitely feeling like I&#039;m operating on a higher level of consciousness.<br /><br />Ok back to the studying... :-X
