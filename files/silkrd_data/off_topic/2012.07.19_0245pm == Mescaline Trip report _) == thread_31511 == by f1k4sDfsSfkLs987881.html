				As i am shortly to become a vendor on SR who will be selling my prized Mescaline HCL, I thought I&#039;d share one of my old trip reports from an old forum i used to regular.&nbsp; Bare in mind that this is a &quot;snot&quot; brew, not mesc hcl.&nbsp; But the feelings are very similair, minus the waiting and minus the nausea.&nbsp; Either way a good read.&nbsp; I have plenty more of these... Anyway hope youe enjoy...<br /><br />&quot;Well, as noted, my gf and i recieved our happy package from peru a few days back.. Immediately ran home on lunch break and chopped the 150 grams peruvian torch in a blender with small amount of water. Added the slime to a saucepan with water and lemon on low heat, ran back to work and had my gf watch over the brew for about 6 hours. AFter work, came home and ripped an old shirt and proceeded to strain the sloodge. Took ages, kinda annoying. Jesus man, the feeling of it! The snot itself is just that, it resembles a collective of what caonly be described as YEARS WORTH OF BOOGERS.&nbsp; &nbsp;lol. After the snot was collected, reduced that a bit more. What is left is about 5 medium doses in the form of appoximately 4.5 cups. Let it sit in the fridge, and after a long debate in my head of whether or not to take it, we decided against it because at this point its about 9pm. Wise decision, especially for us working folk. <br /><br />About 2am i woke with a massive migraine, and couldnt get back to sleep. Called in sick to work and proceeded to the nearest pharmacuetical vendor. After a few helpings of tabs, the headache subsided. At around 12:30 we decided to purchase Fear and Loathing and do this proper style. Came back and necked down the DISGUTING VILE SLIMY TANGY BITTER HOL-PUKE-DOWN-WHILE-SWALLOWING-AND-IMAGINING-A-HAPPY-PLACE brew, with my gf. She nearly puked about 8 times bless her, she did well not to puke. I necked mine and the nausea soon kicked in. Went upstairs and popped in the Fear and Loathing DVD. For the next 45 minutes, my gf really suffered. I was bad,but damn, she turned the color of the goop. Around the 45 minute mark, an insatiable wave of horniness came over me and my gf, probobly due to her love of stroking a member. We romped, like normal, but for some reason about half way through it just started to slow down, and each minute seemed like 5, the sensations became altogether more pleasurable.. This dragged on and on, was similair to sex on great extacy peak, except at thispoint we didnt realize anything was the matter because we were stck in the moment, as you do. We finished and hopped in the shower. Upon stepping out of the shower, something just wasnt right! i turned around and observed my gf was still in the shower, rubbing soap suds over herself, with both the water and the lights off! Uh oh. Helped her turn the water on and let there be light, she exploded in a fit of laughter and the games had begun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The body high.. OH THE BODY HIGH!!! I have never, EVER experienced anything so perfectly balanced and pleasurable in all my life. Even the good X we all reminisce about from back in the day was dirty and simply insignificant by comparison. This was sensation to a whole new dimension! For hours and hours we moved from room to room observing the empty house like a pair of astranauts first observed the moon, rubbing every surface and watching the textures swirl and mix under our touch. Utterly engrossing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw carpet become almsot sand-like, blowing and shifting as if it were the victim of a harsh desert wind. The parrallel shadows left on the ceiling by light that was creeping through the blinds became the most vivid spectrum of red blues and greens, as if i was squinting into a single pixel on the TV screen, however this description is hardly accurate. The most sudden and aggressive urge to eat enwrapped us, so we ventured to the kitchen. For 5-10 minutes i struggled to open a pizza box, then after a massive defeat over this cardboard enemy, my victory dance was cut short by the realization that the frozen goods were still covered by an almost invisible nemesis known as plastic. At once i tore at the plastic, my gf watching this tribal-like ritual in pure awe.&nbsp; &nbsp; My hands and fingers were becoming tiresome, weak, and useless.. The platic nemesis was the perfect match for my intention.. I was losing. :-ss When all hope was lost, and the battle was drawing to a dreary defeat, the word &quot;tool&quot; burst into flames in my head as evolutionarily as neanderthals first strike of flint to stone over straw. Creation was to be borne! I scanned the kitchen and found a knife, and lifted it to the plastic, however my hands lost grip and the knife fell. I dodged the blade from landing through my toe, bent down an attempted to retrieve it, suddenly.. i soon realized the pizza had an ace up his sleeve! The Floor! As if it was reinforcements for this epic feud, the floor waved menacingly. The tiles of light and dark brown swirled and breathed in a manner similiar to my first acid trip. The lines morphed to and fro, and soon i was trapped. AFter fondling the ground for a very, very long time, if time was a real essence, my reinforment arrived. My gf raised me off the ground and told me to go upstairs. Im assumig all went well for her, depsite my doubts in her ability to cope with this task against such a resourceful energy, because after 20 minutes she came upstairs with hot, cheesy pizza and the room was filled with the delightful smell of sustanence. However, eating is a completly new task. It is very hard to describe how hard it was to eat, despite the deeep hunger we both felt. Hands numb, mouth dry and jaw useless, i chewed more like a cow from side to side than a human and swallowed whole chunks. THe image of us sat there, helpless to help ourselves, what a sight.. it will embezzled in memory forever. All in all this eating project, from start to finish, probobly took an hour and a half. I went to the bathroom to wash off the inch-thick layer of sauce and cheese that covered an area of chin to upper nose, and i dunked my face in the sink. AFter a good scrub which by the way FELT INCREDDDDDDDIBLE, i popped my head out of the water and remembered to breath. At this moment i opened my eyes and fell back in startled fright. Before my very eyes, there was a square window or portal of some sort which showed a parrallel universe. In this window stood a man, surrounded by the very same evironment that i was standing in, except the immediate charectistics of this man was blurred and indistinctive due to the mesh and constant morphing of the energy (mustve been energy) around him. I quickly realized that person was a friend, and only wanted to observe my world as i indeed wanted to observe his. In silence we stood, watching and taking all things in. Once i tried to speak to him, however he tried to speak at the exact same moment and my word was cutshort in the effort of preserving manners, even in this other-wordly encounter. This person mustve been more of a form rather than a being, because his apparent features seemed to never be limited to reality.. instead the confines of what one might believe to be &quot;real&quot; were dashed and eroded. This was altogether mind boggling. For what mustve been 30 minutes I observed this form&#039;s hair-like top MORPH and swim as if his world was one that is submerged underwater. Flowing and swaying, the rhythm of the pattern began to resonate into the surrounding setting, until i realized that this beautiful interaction was breaching the hull of the portal.. his waves came through into the bathroom where i was standing, slowly at first, unnoticeable due to the distraction of the pleasurable interaction, but when i finaly realized it was too late. The swarm of waves made me retreat in fright, and my eyes turned to the walls as the waves passed through them. I looked at the man again to ask for an answer as to why he had betrayed my trust, however his eyes were a deep, livid RED and his hair-like substance was no longer swaying underwater but blazing towards the roof the way that flames tear upwards through a dry newspaper. I jumped out, JUST IN TIME, and slammed the door shut.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My gf came through to see what the commotion was about, and could hardly speak as she notice i was COVERED in sweat. Dripping! I decided against an explanation. We sat down and endeavoured to continue with our film, starting from the beginning. again. I loved fear an loathing since the first time i read the book and watched the film, however i never new a storyline to be so gripping. As the movie progressed to its deeper and darker stages, I found myself flinchin at the same things that Duke did, and suddenly jumping when Duke threw an orange at his attorney rather than electrocuting him to death in the bath tub as requested. Amazing. I believe my peak mustve subsided around 6 o clock or soemthing, or maybe it was just that we were now used to this apparent state of being an were able to think somewhat rationally, now taking things in with a pinch of salt. BUt still with a sizable helping of WhatTheFuck Sauce. We watched the sun set on the roof terrace, 6th floor, and burned a spliff. This was just so lovely, the endorphins danced a theatrical performance on my brain. Long after sunset we went back in to find it had gotten rather cold. So we strapped ourselves up in a coat and pants each, and just had the urge to romp further. For anyone reading this, please please please if you get the chance to do this amazing journey, make sure you do it with your partner or gf, and make sure to have a come up shag about 30-60 mins in. Also keep shgging throughout the day because everytime you do, the SPARKS FLY! IN YOUR HEAD! amazing, just amazing. The high nevr ended, the senations never subsided and and the swirling never stilled. EVentually i had to hit the sheets and i passed out with no problems. Still have 2 doses and plan on shroomin with them on a camping trip in a few weeks time (when my grow is producing amicably) to create a whole new experience again. I highly recommend this Torch,. One of the happiest experiences of my life.I have never been so comfortable on a trip in my life. Happy hunting people, thanks for stopping by.<br /><br />PS. I never found out who the man in the mirror was&nbsp; &nbsp; ;) ;) ;)&nbsp; &quot;

				dude if you start selling mescaline i am going to be one one of your first customers and i will sell you a piece of my soul in the process, so put me on your mailing list or something. i have always wanted to try mescaline but it seems non-existent in the u.s. unless you get san pedro or peruvian torch and make it yourself which my situation doesnt allow for a set-up like that or i probably would have by now, but yeah you the man cant wait&nbsp; to see you get a listing up. and im really hoping you are within the u.s. cuz i just can bring myself to order outside the coutry
