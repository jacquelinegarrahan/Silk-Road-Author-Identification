				I think silkroad should make another site a much more private site for all the higher up buyers and Vendors. Like a separate url were not everyone can just register with only a few clicks. A site were a far more sophisticated community of vendors and buyers can exchange with out any worries of LE trolling around looking for a bust! It seems highly possible. all vendors who have been here for a good while would be allowed also buyers im sure sr can do this and provide a more underground community such as ovdb: quantity wise and vendor wise but not in the sense of how public and hot that forum was. Any ways this is just what i think.&nbsp; What is everyone elses thoughts on this ?

				How about just the higher ranked trustworthy vendors but still allow all buyers so noobs like me won&#039;t get scammed again? Just make sure the vendors are appointed by the admins and all that jazz

				This is a free market place. If too many scammers appear, people will buy only from one source. If that source starts charging too much or delivering shit product, you can always see a lucrative opportunity and create some competition.<br /><br />Would be nice to have a better way to verify if seller did send the package and buyer indeed received the contents.

				Im sure many exist as a matter a fact i know of 2 that dont just allow anyone to join which i find pretty great but i guess those are for the cool kids.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am just putting it out there what if anything ever happens to the public SR similar to what happened to ovdb ?&nbsp; If so we would have a sr for the longterm members. and vendors could still vend in the public forum just have another one for the more serious buyers/vendors who wish to trade with ease&nbsp;
