				If its friday we cant send till monday afternoon. Any other day the issue could be he&#039;s run out unexpectedly, thinking he had enough for current orders but misjudged stock and is waiting for more. Annoying i know but shit happens.

				Vendors usually work alone, since the fewer people know about their unlawful activities the better. So if they get flooded with orders there&#039;s no-one to call for help. I think most vendors have little experience selling online and are surprised at how much work it is.

				Theres all sorts of reasons why it might take a while - i&#039;ve had a few vendors run into personal issues they had to resolve which slowed down their work. You&#039;ve gotta respect that. <br /><br />Alternatively - they might have forgotten - that can happen. No harm in sending a message to double check your order is ready to go if its now beyond the timescale they specified on the page? A decent vendor wouldn&#039;t resent you for that. <br /><br />And finally - theres always the chance they already sent it but havent marked it in transit yet. I&#039;ve had things arrive on the same day they were marked in transit a few times, meaning they&#039;d obviously been sent earlier.

				Oh - and of course theres the chance your small order fell to the bottom of the pile as less important than larger orders. <br /><br />Which is a dick move&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />you can only speculate though...!
