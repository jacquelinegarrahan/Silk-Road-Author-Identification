				I drank a few times, but the calories and hangovers only made me think more about what I might be missing out on in terms of illicit substances. And all my favorite comedians and musicians and whatnot&nbsp; point to me being the kind of person who would be into said substances, but now I find myself in my 30s and I feel obsessed with trying some stuff but I&#039;ve also doomed myself by getting set up in one of those backwards societies where they basically like chop of your hands or whatever if you get caught with a single joint (slight exaggeration).<br /><br />ITT, console me.

				You&#039;re not very good at keeping secrets are you?(lol)&nbsp; Anyway, not sure what you need to be consoled for, this is a site where you can order pretty much any substance you want.&nbsp; Start ordering!<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan of alchohol either actually, I get horrible hangovers and I just act stupid.&nbsp; Maybe that makes you feel better?

It going wrong would mean insane amounts of prison time. The whole &quot;plausible deniablility&quot; thing doesn&#039;t work here, and they do carry out controlled deliveries, and you or somebody has to sign for packages that come.

				Well, you sound like you&#039;re pretty fucked then.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(&nbsp; If you&#039;re really interested in drugs then you should consider moving away.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that there is an easier solution.&nbsp; Which country anyway?&nbsp; Consider using some newer drugs/research chemicals that are legal everywhere just so that you can get a feel for whether you&#039;d be interested in drugs or not.

				Can you go on holiday somewhere that you would find easy to get drugs?<br /><br />I too never drink alcohol (only on social occasions), I just not my thing.

I intend to travel to a less fucked country soon and confirm my suspicion that I&#039;m a latent mind-enhancement enthusiast, and based on that I&#039;ll decide how important it is for me to pursue more. <br /><br />Maybe if I focus really hard on coming up with a safe way to get a nice invisible stash of candies that can last me a few years if only used in moderation I can be happy...
