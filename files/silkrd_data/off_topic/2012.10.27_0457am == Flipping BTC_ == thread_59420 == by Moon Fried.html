				I was looking at Mt. Gox after finding out BI isn&#039;t currently accepting btc to email and considered flipping BTC. How difficult would it be to start flipping? It doesn&#039;t seem hard. Wait until value goes down, buy a good amount, then wait for the value to go back up and sell it. Does anyone here do that now? I feel like it would be a fun thing to do more than something for profit.

				Was thinking the exact same thing today after making my first mtgox transaction for the reason you mention. Appears that&#039;s all mtgox is, just a big trading floor. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there are people here doing that. I&#039;ve decided to study the trends for the last 2 years or so; I just started paying attention to btc, so I currently have no point of reference for how this market works. Hopefully some SR members will step in a give some tips/pointers :)

				I sort of tried my hand at this when i started purchasing btc. Then i suffered some major losses, bought 1000$ worth btc at almost 12$, they crashed same day, before the coins even came to my account, and the vendor i wanted to buy from had put his stuff on hold, ended up losing a fair bit. Now i just try to buy my coins immediately before making the purchase. Also, i heard mtgox banned some accounts for suspicious activity recently, you may want to look into that before u start this, but heres something that may help you out, speculation on current market rate<br /><br />clearnet : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0
