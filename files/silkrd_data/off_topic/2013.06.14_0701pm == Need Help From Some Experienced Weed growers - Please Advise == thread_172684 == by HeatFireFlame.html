				Hi all , thanks for reading. il describe the situation and setup first then go on to ask you questions. <br />so i have 3 plants, Outdoors in a guerrilla grow purely for personal use. they have been out there now for 3 weeks i would say and are overall are about 5 weeks old. they are very healthy and are having no problems. they are protected by slug pellets and chicken wire around them. I also piss around them for good measure :) The grow is in the northern hemisphere as well so i reckon they will take roughly 20 weeks to complete.<br /><br />So i ordered fox Farms trio nutrients, I realize it&#039;s slightly late bt better late than never.&nbsp; it is the trio with open sesame, beastie blooms and cha ching. they are the water soluble ones not the liquid ones. <br /><br />I know that foxfarms feeding schedule is quite extreme so i was going to go with half doses of whatever they say, simple right? well heres where it gets a bit more complicated.<br />The 0.25 of a teaspoonful they recommend is per gallon. and seeing the size of my plants at the moment im watering with a 2litre bottle not a gallon. they also say water twice a week, Im only needing to water once a week due to it being in the northern hemisphere and slight rain every now and again. So i reckon the twice a week was angled more towards indoor. <br /><br />so am i right in saying that watering them once a week with a 2litre bottle i should be using 1/16th of the powder per teaspoonful.&nbsp; 1/16th instead of an 1/8th because im only watering once a week, each time will be with nutes, and because im watering with a 2 litre bottle not a gallon,and as im sure you know there is around 4 and 1/2 litres in a gallon. <br /><br />Any advice would be really appreciated. here&#039;s the foxfarms feeding schedule.<br />http://foxfarmfertilizer.com/frontpage/feeding-schedules.html

				Are your plants straight in the bottom? If so you probably dont have to use fertilizer.<br />Less is more..<br />Dont water it too much. And really start using fertilizers when the plant need some..<br />If you use too much fertilizer the earth can get very salty. The roots will die, and the plant, too.<br />So for your problem you could mix up some more, and store the rest.<br />If its no bio-fertilizer it will be usuable at least a couple of days.
