				Weeks of continuous sobriety has again made me think how shitty the world is. So lying on my bed, trying to get some sleep, I started thinking what I would do with a time machine - and killing historical figures is what I thought of.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t go for the most obvious choice and kill off Hitler. There&#039;s no guarantee that the end result would improve the present day world - I mean what if WWII was fought 30 years later with nuclear weapons instead? The religious characters are also very tempting to me, considering the immeasurable suffering their followers have caused in their name, but again the changes could easily have too dramatic consequences to the present day. What I ended up with was Harry Anslinger, because he&#039;s the reason why we&#039;re all outlaws here. Because of that one American no country in the world except the USA has the power to legalize recreational drugs without inducing the wrath of the UN.

				I hate to get into this line of thinking because in the end all the variations make it really hard to process the consequences. But if you do like this stuff you should really really read the latest (?) Stephen King where this guy tries to kill&nbsp; Lee harvee Oswold (sp?) to prevent him from killing Kennedy and preventing Vietnam.<br /><br />Won&#039;t give out the rest of the plot, but that plan doesn&#039;t work out the way it should ;)<br /><br />But let me give me one example of unforseen consequences. Say you manage to kill hitler, let&#039;s say 1942 before the real holocaust was in place as efficiently. Then Paulus wouldn&#039;t have gotten the order to stay put in Stalingrad wiping out the entire 6th army (or have gotten the insane irrational order to attack anyway) . Or in the defensive on the russian front the generals would have executed their prefrerred &#039;elastic defense&#039; strategy. So without Hitler the Germans actually had way more chance to win. <br />So, this is quite the dilemma, a german victory without the holocaust, or german annihilation with one..<br /><br /><br />

				I would have chosen John Wilks Booth, had the choice been available. I&#039;m no Lincophile, but Reconstruction under Lincoln would have gone much better.<br /><br />Instead I chose Muhammad. Simply because religious strife is the most common theme in the last 1000+ years. One of the two main factions should go.

				Regarding Hitler there is this view that if Hitler may have gotten into the Vienna School of Arts which he applied to in 2 rounds then there would just have appeared another Hitler-figure because the German people just wanted a dictator at the time and anti-semitism was just a phenomenon that could not be dealt with rationally due to the history of anti-semitism stemming from way back to when Jesus was crucified. There actually was a kindda-nazi-party before Hitler&#039;s nazi-partiy and there were figures, can&#039;t remember their names, but who were also known for their speeches and way of exiting the crowd. <br /><br />Hitler was therefore not exceptional, he was just the one carrying it out. I guess this is viewing history as deterministic.

The crowd was going wild, the man was giving a very anti-Semitic speech. Hitler noted the man lacked oratory tallent, but he excelled at illiciting passion from the crowd due to his message.<br /><br />So you are partially correct.<br /><br />I submit, however, that man meets that moment in time to become great. The greatest man will meet that moment to seize it. Ceaser did it 2000 years before when he ended the Republic. I do not mean here for great to be synonymous with good or morality.

If Jesus was never born people would be worshiping someone else, the details of the implementation would change but not the overall concept. Also if you kill Jesus it is kind of a waste since he will just rise from the dead lololol.

				I remember a short sci-fi story I read ages ago. People in the future discovered time travel and decided to go back and kill Hitler. They succeeded in doing so, but the ending twist was that Hitler was replaced by mentally unstable double, who did all that evil shit.
