				oh yes I really like that idea&nbsp; :D<br /><br />My concerns are, that a possible jury would have to recive deliveries from around the world. <br />They would have to receive deliveries from flagged countries and from vendors which they would never choose because of their ratings, stealth etc. <br /><br />But in general it is a wonderful idea which would strenghten the community&nbsp; :)

				I wonder how many true &#039;premium&#039; vendors are on SR. I&#039;d guess the largest number would be in America/Canada, so it would make sense to have the panel there (sign, rules me out!), and mailing into these countries is less risky than some other places, and probably only need to be sending 1/8ths for the comp.<br /><br />Perhaps the panel would provide the prize (as they are the lucky ones who get to sample the goods).<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest there are only about 50 max &#039;premium&#039; vendors, but of course we&#039;d have to have it open to any vendor who wished to enter.<br /><br />Come-on, let&#039;s do it SR community!<br /><br />I guess I could start contacting some of the premium vendors to see if they might be interested in such an idea.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				Interesting idea. But i don&#039;t think we could open it to just anyone. That would allow LE to join too. Also i think this idea would need to have a lot of backing by the community and moderators to make this work. I feel like some vendors might need a little more convincing then others to send out samples as well.

				Hey Guys,<br />I am eager to start sending out samples of some of my best strains i have acquired and grown over the many years i have been growing.<br />I have done a fair bit of research of how to send it internationally, for others going to attempt this feat DO NOT USE MBB, they can spot it from a mile away.<br />Also i believe i have strains that America hasn&#039;t seen yet, these strains came into my hands from growing outdoors 15-20 years ago and the f@#king neighbors in my area left there males to pollinate my female strains, so after years and years of this happening my strains evolved into what i have today.<br />To other weed Vendors reading this, if you think your buds that good take a hit and give out some free samples and see if your top dawg of the weed industry.<br />SAGreat

				This is an awesome ground breaking idea.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would love to become a judge.&nbsp; I always dreamed of going to one of these events in Amsterdam or wherever.&nbsp; Having one in cyberspace would be a ground breaking timeless event.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing the contesting vendors would have to enter by leaving some kind of pool in escrow w/ DPR and having a forum dedicated to the event. <br /><br />This will also lead to vendors pulling out their very best gear in order to be known as 2013&#039;s SR cannabis cup kings.<br /><br />Time to get a new nail for my vape pen and some more of those bad ass skull shaped glass globes they&#039;ve been selling online.&nbsp; (find them on alibaba or ebay)<br /><br />

				I think we should make a new thread when the contest is ready. &quot;SR Cannabis Cup 2013&quot; sounds good.<br /><br />So here is my idea:<br /><br />We pick a few good judges (trustworthy good reviewers) on this thread.<br /><br />Any Vendor can enter the contest for a entry fee of sending small samples of the weed they want to enter into the contest to the judges.<br /><br />No Vendor/Judge is allowed to participate if his/her reputation is labeled as shadowy<br /><br /><br />Each week for one month the judges present a full lengthy review of the weed they decided to try that week and compare notes and give a grade. At the end of the month they announce the top 3 winners.<br /><br />We need rules about shipping, security, country and so on. We could maybe make different 2 contests, one EU and one USA.<br /><br />Maybe we could scratch together a prize of sorts<br /><br />Dont forget to make me the first judge ^^

				It would only be fair to the vendor if it consisted of;<br /><br />Vendors make a special events listing with samples of their entry.&nbsp; <br /><br />A limited number of listings and a limited time they&#039;re listed in order to get the ball rolling.<br /><br />That way we can all participate as a community and it doesn&#039;t kill the vendor or the event financially.&nbsp; Listing could be discounted for judge packages.&nbsp; Event guest can purchase other special event listings which have been tailored by vendors in order to show of their wares.&nbsp; <br /><br />The thread&#039;s on the forum are like the Leger for the event.&nbsp; Keeping track of everything, and even links to behind the scenes clips like judges getting high live online on an IRC talking bout whatever.<br /><br />

				I was thinking again about that idea again. <br />There has to be something to identify the vendor which sent the product. Otherwise the judge ends up with 10samples in his postal box and doesn`t know which one it was. Everyone ordered from two vendors at the same time knows what I am talking about ;D<br />So these vendors need to get a secret number/letter which they should attach to the weed (better no handwritting) to identify them AFTER the judges are done ;)<br /><br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t have a good drop to be a judge for Europe, makes me really sad :&#039;(

				Perhaps each entrant is given a letter From A thru to Z (and numbers if required).<br /><br />I would think some vendors would probably want to enter more than 1 strain. Perhaps we would need to cap each vendor to 1 or 2 strains or it may become too big.<br /><br />Waiting to see how many vendors are interested. If you know of a good one, why not message them on the site informing them of this idea, and they can p.m on the forums and I will add their names to the list of possible entrants.<br /><br />Kneo

A limit to how many strains a vendor is allowed to submit should be limited to 1. This is a contest for best weed. Not a review thread for diverse products. Vendor sends in their #1.

Thx for your interest!<br /><br />At this stage we are thinking it best to only allow vendors who have been around for 3 months - but by the time the comp comes around you will probably be there ;-) <br /><br />I see you and deathowl1990 don&#039;t seem to be getting along too well! Even if you were to be an entrant and deathowl1990 a judge, the comp would be setup in the way that the judges will be unaware who&#039;s product they are testing. <br /><br />Checkout the rumor mill thread for further info.<br /><br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=215188.<br /><br />Kneo

				I recommend a buyer who goes by the name BDA, he has sampled every bit of bud on the Australian domestic market and always leaves a very detailed review.<br />He also uploads photos of the buds in HD so people can understand where he is coming at when he writes his reviews. <br />I will get him to contact Kneotac to apply for this as he would more then make a great judge.<br />SAGreat
