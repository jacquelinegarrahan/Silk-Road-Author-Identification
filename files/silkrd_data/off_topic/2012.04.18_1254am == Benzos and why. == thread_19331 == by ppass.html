				A seemingly stupid question I realize. But why do people like benzos? Ive taken all shapes and sizes (never paid more than 2 a bar) and have never had a &quot;fun&quot; time on them, unless you enjoy remembering looped ten second bursts of your life. Anyway, just curious as to how each person justifies benzos as recreational.<br /><br />Your thoughts? (If you can remember them) :D

				For me they&#039;re a cure for hangovers, comedowns and bad trips. They also make beer buzzier.

				They&#039;re a good way to relax if you don&#039;t want to get too messed up (Ativan, Xanax 0.25mg or 0.5mg).<br /><br />A lot of the time I feel irritable after using stimulants (cocaine, adderall, mdma) and benzos help you get to sleep.<br />They&#039;re also good to have around in case of a bad trip on mushrooms or LSD, (i don&#039;t know how safe this is, haven&#039;t read much about it), and they make you a cheap drunk.<br /><br />An all around good item to have around if your a frequent drug user in my opinion.

				They&#039;re good for relaxation and if you&#039;re feeling anxious or worried.<br /><br />They don&#039;t get you &quot;high&quot; per se. They&#039;re more of a utility drug.

				I don&#039;t take it recreationally per say but I do take it to get rid of anxiety, and it does a pretty damn good job. If you&#039;re looking for a fun time, take ecstacy. If you&#039;re looking to lessen your anxiety, get klonopins, they are the longest acting benzos ranging from anywhere between 8-18 hours, they&#039;re my favorite :)<br /><br />Also here&#039;s a tip, take 2 or 4 mg of some benzos with a couple of beers, the relaxation is euphoric to me.

				I have an actual prescription for .5mg xanax and I love them! They seriously changed my life, if not saved it :) The trick to benzos is to use them as tools and not pop em like candy. I&#039;m working on a drug guide right now on drugs I have used as tools and xanax is on there so everyone can start programming their brain that certain things aren&#039;t dangerous, like doing speeches&nbsp; :D

				They depress the central nervous system, where as amphetamine for example does the opposite. They&#039;re a chill pill baby :)

				Another question, another new forum account... sigh..<br /><br />I spent the first half of my life in an almost constant state of anxiety. I didn&#039;t know why or that there were drugs to help me until I discovered benzo&#039;s.<br /><br />Unfortunately like anything that is taken in more than moderation I probably have an addiction to them but for me they have allowed me to enter into social situations (and more) where I could never have dealt with by myself beforehand.<br /><br />Like most drugs you eventually develop a tolerance (or whatever you want to call it) but I find benzo&#039;s help me deal with the various stresses and pains of modern life. Eventually I found it impossible to get them through legal channels (ie: doctors) without having to re-live my life and it&#039;s negatives so I turned to SR where I can get them without judgement. I guess I am one of many who doesn&#039;t just do drugs for &#039;recreational&#039; purposes but to help lead a &#039;normal&#039; life.<br /><br />When (and unfortunately I do believe it will be a when rather than an if) SR is taken away I will either have to go back to begging doctors to help me feel normal or turn to harder drugs (and all the negatives that come with that) to feel normal again.<br /><br />Like I&#039;ve read in many threads I can&#039;t simply take a low dose xanax anymore, I need to take a high dose xanax, a valium, and a clonazepam to get the same effect but it is either that or live in fear and anxiety for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I guess what I am saying is that not everyone is here to get drugs for recreational purposes, some of us actually need them to feel normal. It may seem sad but it&#039;s simply the way it is.

				Thanks for all the feedback fellas. I see for most they are a tool if anything, but there are still quite a few people who do take them for &quot;fun&quot; purposes. I have an anxiety disorder myself and I know the feelings described above all too well&nbsp; :-\ Sadly I also have been a drug addict in the past which colors medical intervention of any nature. Benzos have been deemed &quot;to risky&quot; for me which I am alright with. I just couldn&#039;t image taking them everyday with the way my mind handles Benzos. They have been great for dentists visits though :D&nbsp; But afterwards I immediatly remember why I dont like them. Still to each his own and thanks for putting in the two cents.
