				I am in a position in my life where I am sick of my current country (and its ridiculous attitude towards drugs) and would be interested in people&#039;s opinion on what country&#039;s they would recommend if I wanted to spend 2 or 3 years somewhere with easy access to hard opiates (heroin, morphine, opium) and, ideally, other strong pharm&#039;s (particularly benzo&#039;s)?<br /><br />I am a westerner so would prefer a country where I wouldn&#039;t be a easy target for violence or being ripped off constantly.<br /><br />I have heard people mention times they&#039;ve spent in India and/or Pakistan but I am a relatively naive traveler having only been to other western countries (in my region of the world).<br /><br />Money is not a major object and I would be happy to make a few shorter trips to get to grips with things before moving there for an extended period but as part of my short existence on this planet I would like to spend a few years developing a nice strong opiate habit. I am by no means naive to opiates and am currently addicted anyway but would like to get as close to the source as possible. From my current knowledge (and it&#039;s not really any type of secret) Afghanistan is still by far the world&#039;s leading supplier of illicit opiates but I don&#039;t think I have the balls to consider going anywhere near there. :)<br /><br />So, if anyone has had a desire in a similar life journey that they have followed through with, any recommendations would be much appreciated?<br />

				Good question.&nbsp; First, I&#039;d probably recommend--if u haven&#039;t already--that you check out opiophile.org, where this comes up regularly, and often you&#039;ll have people either living in, or who have visited different countries for just this reason.<br /><br />Because of the war, unless you are very knowledgable and brave, I&#039;d probably rule out the most obvious, being afghanistan.&nbsp; Harsh night life, I&#039;ve heard, but all is available, there and neighboring places.<br /><br />Mexico, seems to depend more on luck: it&#039;s everywhere and nowhere, and tar can be a mixed blessing anyway.&nbsp; Colombia would probably be a better choice, simply because most of the good powder in the US comes from there.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably do a bit of reading on Colombia, and find a city that sounds appealing, once you are there, it&#039;s all about just walking around with a junky look on your face, and again: get lucky.<br /><br />A nice place to visit, and where there are all kinds of interesting developments happening, would be Vancouver in Canada.&nbsp; Once there, go stay in one of the SRO cheap hotels downtown, and wander over to the Insite injection room.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a large amount of addicts there, and I defy you to walk around there and not bump into some dope.&nbsp; Be careful tho: if you have felony convictions or even a dui conviction, in the good old USA, they will ask that in customs, and if you lie they seem to always catch you and send you back.&nbsp; I hear that is really embarassing, but I&#039;ve known people it&#039;s happened to.&nbsp; But once in country, that&#039;s probably the safest place to hang and be hopeful.<br /><br />That&#039;s my quick take :)

				I have no felony convictions or drug-related convictions.<br /><br />I have access to multiple passports due to my parents being from a different country.<br /><br />I agree Canada does seem like an obvious starting point being a very western country. I guess my concern is that it is not any closer to the purer substances than the current country I am living in.<br /><br />I am obviously being vague so sorry if that is frustrating.<br /><br />I will take phubaiblues advice and investigate opiophile.org further. I am aware of the site and have spent many hours there but I must admit it&#039;s been awhile since I visited the site.<br /><br />I am still open to recommendations if anyone has any other interesting ideas.

The victims were locals so perhaps as a westerner with enough cash to keep myself out of trouble it is a possibility. Thanks for the input.

				Cambodia, Northern Laos, Southern Vietnam or Yunan Province, China<br /><br />All of those have access to opiates, lax police/enforcement and available drugs.&nbsp; Hell, pot grows wild in Yunan.<br /><br />As for a visa/work permit, you&#039;re on your own.&nbsp; Good luck though, living overseas and doing drugs is much more fun than sittin at home!

				Yournamehere I think you may need to review that pearl of wisdom. <br /><br />I have been to the Vietnam, China and Thailand and anyone under the illusion that countries like that or the surrounding ones have lax police is either lying or has no idea what they are on about and it doesn&#039;t matter that you may be white and in a Hawaiian shirt either. Yeah, those countries do have easy access to cheap and high quality opiates but the penalties for getting caught with them are ridiculous, why do you think life is so cheap there? In China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Burma for example, they can execute you if they think you are a drug dealer and they don&#039;t give a fuck if they get it wrong. Also if you get put away you may as well shoot yourself. It&#039;s not like the west where you may only get raped once or twice unless you are a real pussy. You&#039;ll get gangbanged by the lot of them in a filthy cell, they will then cut you open and the guards will sell your organs back to rich Americans. <br /><br />So yeah, by all means go on an Asian smack tour, good times to be had by all but don&#039;t think that Asian 5-O is lax by any means. Who doesn&#039;t know that? <br /><br />

				Thanks guys for all the input even though some of it seems contradictory. :)<br /><br />At this point I am leaning towards Cambodia and Indonesia, both of which are common destinations for Aussie travelers.<br /><br />Perhaps this thread has run its course as the last post is almost a couple of weeks old but does anyone have any information or insight into Mongolia? I ask because I have a close friend who has moved there (and been there for several years). Problem is he is not into drugs in any way so I almost feel cheap in asking him for information.<br /><br />But, thanks to everyone who has contributed and if things end up as I would like perhaps I could pass on some of what I find to the SR community as it has given me such a lot during my time here.

				Thailand there are opium dens galore with tourists in them. Seems police never go in there.<br />Just never, ever take some to go. If you&#039;re caught with drugs hefty jail sentence.<br /><br />Indonesia you could get executed for doing drugs don&#039;t even think of going there. Same with Cambodia.<br /><br />Canada full of heroin but it&#039;s not cheap, quality is excellent though.<br />Low risk if you&#039;re caught just as a user.

				Watch the documentary Flipping Out. It is about Israeli soldiers who are given money and often spend a couple of years in India just letting go, taking drugs etc. Very interesting.&nbsp; The Indians put up with them because they need the money and the exsoldiers go there because living is cheap and so are the drugs.
