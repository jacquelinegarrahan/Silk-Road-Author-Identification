				If the Feds are concerned about SR they have another thing&nbsp; to worry about other than drugs....searching through Tor. there are sites dealing with all kinds of shit. the worst is those sick fuck pedophiles. <br /><br />An glad the armory is gone too...But the news reported SR was selling drugs....big fucking deal!&nbsp; how come they didn&#039;t profile the pedophiles...Why because the reporter needed something to fill the slot..they can kiss my ass. personally i don&#039;t care what type of drug you do.. but messing with kids is sick.. <br /><br />anyway, just needed to vent. The US spends more time fucking with peaceful drug users. They don&#039;t need to worry about SR, but really,&nbsp; Look at the big picture, there is a lot of crazy stuff in deep web. we may be an easy target but, we are the least of the Governments problem. Just be careful and say not to Kids..<br /><br />I wish we could have a site just for weed and shrooms and LSD. It would make my world wonderful... ::) ;D<br /><br />

				I agree with the thread starter. The should worry more about the poor children than us doing what we do. I always wondered how those sick fucks spread child porn on the net. Tor is a gift and a curse and those sick bastards need to be dealt with.

				The first time I accessed deepnet I visited the hidden wiki. I suppose it&#039;s a start point for most people. I was expecting to see links to things I wouldn&#039;t approve of, but I had a surprisingly visceral reaction to seeing cp links being advertised. It genuinely upset me. I was quite shaken, felt nauseous, shut it down and didn&#039;t log on again for several weeks. I guess I found it quite shocking to see it all advertised so openly as if it was normal.<br /><br />We have such a wonderful place here and a true anonymous society where freedoms and liberty are paramount, and there are people here who are doing truly wonderful things (like those lovely crypto-anarchists helping us all with security, the brilliant vendors on SR helping us subvert ridiculous laws, etc)... It&#039;s just a shame that there are people who taint it.<br /><br />Whilst I&#039;m an atheist, I&#039;ve always appreciated the poetry and message behind the &quot;Wiccan Rede&quot;, it pretty much sums up how I feel about everything. &quot;Eight words ye Wiccan Rede fulfill – An&#039; it harm none, Do what ye will&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to see our governments (and their budgets) targeting those sites and communities rather than wasting money on the activities of consenting adults, but I don&#039;t see it happening, ever.

Anyway, I don&#039;t have to look at CP, and I actually refrain from doing so as I find it to either be extremely pointless to look at even if it is not disgusting and doesn&#039;t strike me as particularly offensive, or in many cases entirely disgusting and upsetting. That said, I really couldn&#039;t give a fuck less what other people look at and I find it to be rather troubling that so many people give so much of a fuck about what others look at. There is clearly no magic re-victimization process, nobody who is victimized in the making of CP would necessarily even know that people were looking at it if the police didn&#039;t tell them every time they bust someone, if you believe the highly dubious claim that people looking at CP fuels the CP market through demand then there are PIR systems that can cryptographically hide the demand, etc. It just doesn&#039;t strike me as a big deal if someone looks at a picture of anything, I am much more worried by peoples desire to do horrible things to people who do something as completely neutral as looking at an arrangement of colored pixels. Additionally, I think that if jailbait porn was legal that a fucking lot of people who claim to be against CP would be watching it all the time.

I&#039;d also argue that freedom of expression does not constitute child abuse.<br /><br />I think a lot more research needs to be done into the relationship between cp and whether it does fuel people to commit crimes IRL. I read an article a while back about a woman who was petitioning to have S&amp;M and similar fetish porn made illegal, because her daughter was murdered by a man who had a bit of an obsession with porn containing violent/non-consensual kinks. IMO, this was utterly ridiculous, there are plenty of consenting adults within various fetish communities who can happily watch &quot;violent&quot; porn without progressing to committing crimes. *Presumably*, there are many paedophiles are in a similar position. However, there is a massive difference between cp and other fetish porn - namely, age and consent of participants.<br /><br />If cp shared in the forms of fictional literature, drawings, computer generated images or anything else created without harming children in the slightest, then I don&#039;t see a problem with it. I may not like it or approve of it, but it&#039;s not harming anyone.

I do however blame the war on drugs for putting the money in to the hands of organized crime rather then pharmacies, head shops, bars.. whatever.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 karma solid post paxpax<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know how some people can may the argument that censorship is bad therefore cp should be allowed. There is no rational argument you can make for the distribution of such images. And the idea of allowing pornographic drawings, writings etc involving children is abhorrent in a civilized society. We don&#039;t allow these things because we don&#039;t allow the people who do such things, to live amongst us.

Nice....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In a nutshell I think that it causes absolutely no ill effect if you look at pictures of anything. I once myself was not in favor of CP possession being decriminalized, but then I woke up one day and realized that all of the arguments for keeping it illegal are fucking retarded and based on lies concocted by people who have financial reasons to keep it illegal, and all of the arguments for it being legal to look at make perfect sense and are generally not coming out of the mouthes of people who seem to be borderline psychotic and/or fucking retarded. Seriously take a step back, you are in favor of making certain very large numbers illegal. From a strictly technical point of view it is just mind boggling absurd. What if you add +1 to the decimal representation of a CP picture? What if you split it up into a bunch of tiny numbers?? What if you encode it as a book with English words, should that book consisting of words that can then be translated to the picture be made iillegal? What if I change the word encoding program to use different words??? What if I use stego and hide CP in a movie? Or analyze a movie and see which pixels correlate to those in a CP image and then release a program that slices those pixels from the movie and reconstructs them into the CP image or a rough approximation of it? Do you want all digital content to be illegal? <br /><br />From a practical perspective it doesn&#039;t make any sense either. The large majority of people who view CP are not child molesters, so their crime is entirely in looking at an image. What harm does that cause? I can not see this magic that so many seem convinced of, that looking at a series of colored pixels has an effect on the world outside of the electrical patterns in the brain of the viewer and components of the electronics used to transfer and display it. What is so wrong about that? it is no different than looking at a picture of a fucking lake or the holocaust. People who say otherwise are simply making shit up to justify their own opinions, it is as if I say &quot;What you eat carrots?! That causes children to die! What the fuck is wrong with you you child murderer!&quot; !! It is called a non-sequitur, it is a logical fallacy and it is more suited to propaganda than any rational argument. <br /><br />Even in the fantasy world where looking at CP causes a rise in demand which in turn causes more children to be molested, there are steps that can be taken to entirely mask the demand for CP while still allowing it to be viewed. Ever heard of private information retrieval ? But of course nobody would even consider this, because their issue is not really with people viewing child porn leading to an increase in molestation, their issue is simply with people viewing child porn. They are demonized by the sensationalist media, they are made to be synonymous with child molesters despite the overwhelming evidence that the majority of them are not and they are hunted down by law enforcement and private industry which makes profits of billions of dollars a year in doing so. There are several dozen cases of falsified statistics which have been exposed from these groups. <br /><br />It is really pointless to even mention these things, because the people who are against CP being legal to view are entirely emotional creatures or they have been brainwashed entirely by the media/government. Their views are empirically proven as wrong and it does not stop them from parroting the same debunked bullshit and peddling the same hogwash about magic processes or ignoring that even in the fantasy world they live in where they are correct about the facts, steps could be taken to completely ameliorate the risks they present, such as PIR to cryptographically mask demand. <br /><br />I wish these people would at least stop acting like they are trying to save the children and instead admit that they are interested in <br /><br />A. making profit<br />B. Attacking people who are harmless, but different from them in ways they can not tolerate <br /><br />my only hope is that they are actually brainwashed and not entirely responsible for their complete lack of reason and blind entirely reasonless hatred.

				I do not think pictures of anything should be illegal to view. I of course think it should be illegal to molest children or to murder people etc. If looking at pictures causes you bad emotions I suggest that you make the personal choice of avoiding to look at those pictures, and give others the right to make their own choices. As long as your actions do not directly hurt another person then they should not be outlawed, and the only way that looking at a picture hurts a person is through some magic process called revictimization. You may as well try to convince me that it should be illegal to pray for bad things to happen to someone as it seems about as absurd to me as making it illegal to look at pictures of bad things happening to someone. DOING bad things to people should be illegal, you are not doing anything to someone by looking at a picture...for the picture to have been taken bad things must have already BEEN DONE.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1 good thing about the yank gov they do actually track there rich pedos in cambodia etc and get them proper time not pay a bribe and of u go,the other govs dont there was a program about it and a guy worth 50 mil from florida got tracked and niked in asia noncing kids&nbsp; and got a proper sentance</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes that is fine and dandy I hope that they catch them all and send them to jail!

				Hi guys, long time lurker...<br /><br />In one of the articles I wrote for an Australian newspaper, I spoke to law enforcement and one of Australia&#039;s leading sex offender experts about this topic.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a blog written for it for a while (I blog at allthingsvice.wordpress.com) but haven&#039;t put it up for fear of people mistaking me for some sort of apologist.&nbsp; That&#039;s the LAST thing I am.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll reproduce it here for the SR community.<br /><br />When researching my story The New Underbelly, I wound up, as you do, with reams of information, the vast majority of which didn’t make it to the article due to space constraints or because it wasn’t what my editor asked for.<br /><br />I briefly quoted Dr Bill Glasner (and I hope I did not misrepresent him in any way) but our exchange was significantly longer and I’d like to share some things I learned about child porn and contact child sex offenders.<br /><br />Now, of course, whilst I did visit many of the sites mentioned in my article – including some of the gateways to the child porn sites – I did not download any child abuse material, i.e. I did not view any pictures or videos.&nbsp; I have less than zero interest in seeing such stuff for journalism purposes or otherwise.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are hundreds, maybe thousands of gigabytes of child porn images (‘Lolita City alone hosts over 100gb).&nbsp; However, one thing I suspect from my research is that the majority of what I would have seen, had I investigated further would not have been what we normally consider “child porn” – i.e. children being subjected to sexual acts by predators – but would more likely be pictures of kids frolicking at the beach or playing in the bath. <br /><br />I have little doubt that there is some porn of the most depraved kind.&nbsp; I saw links that purported to be to images of children being sexually abused or otherwise harmed.&nbsp; But I think this is a very small minority of what child porn users access.<br /><br />I did witness some discussion boards which made me feel physically ill as people discussed children in terms I’ve only ever heard from the most derogatorily misogynist men talking about what they’d like to do with certain porn stars.&nbsp; It is what I saw in these chatrooms that led me to contact Dr Glasner – a clinical psychiatrist who is an expert in the field of sex offenders – to ask him about the effect of the availability of online forums and filesharing sites on child sex offenders – for example, does it normalise such behaviour, given that users of child porn can now be in contact with people ‘just like them’?<br /><br />The TL;DR version of his advice and that of the Australian Institute of Criminology is:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most child porn users are ‘normal’ people who do not go on to actually offend against children but have deviant sexual fantasies.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who talk in the most frightening and offensive way as I mentioned above are more likely NOT to be actual offenders, but are fantasising (much in the same way the vast majority of those who fantasise about rape do not go on to commit/subject themselves to rape).<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most actual offenders do NOT use child porn, but rather turn innocent pictures into porn for their gratification<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual contact offenders are more likely to be a male member of the victim’s family and they are getting their jollies by looking at Facebook pics of kids at the beach or at underwear catalogues.<br /><br />But so I’m not paraphrasing too much, here are Dr Glaser’s observations, in full, in his own words:<br /><br />*** begin Dr Glaser ***<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it looks like the traditional stereotype of the internet child-porn user doesn&#039;t hold up. E.g. some recent studies seem to show that many child porn users have reasonably OK relationships, are not desperate loners searching for approval/companionship and have reasonably effective non-sexual ways of dealing with &quot;stress&quot;.<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly, a substantial proportion of child-porn users (perhaps the majority) do NOT engage in contact sexual offending with children (although, of course, this finding should be interpreted with caution given the huge under-reporting of sexual assault of children)<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as importantly, offenders who only use&nbsp; child porn without going on to assault children seem to have a higher level of deviant sexual fantasies and an increased tendency to hold distorted views of children as sexual beings, compared to those offenders who actually assault kids. This finding is, of course, counter-intuitive at one level but at another level it makes sense: most males (and I apologise for my gender here) experience all sorts of bizarre and horrifying sexual fantasies at some stage but the majority do not act on them. In other words there really does seem to be a &quot;disconnect&quot; between sexual thoughts and sexual behaviours with no good correlation linking the two.<br /><br />So, in terms of your questions:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be possible that for some offenders, contact with other offenders over the internet could help to &quot;normalise&quot; and validate their experiences. After all, despite what I pointed out earlier, one would expect potential offenders who are not well-integrated into the community to seek out, and accept, moral approval for their The key question is: what is being normalised? Having deviant fantasies (in the same way as Star Trek characters and stories are normalised at a Star Trek convention, while everybody realises that they are still just fantasies)? Or acting on the behaviours depicted in the porn (which is, of course, much more sinister)?<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact with other offenders over the internet probably increases the use of internet and other child porn. Whether it increases the risk of sexual assaults on children is simply not known. My guess is that it probably does, simply because there are always going to be particularly nasty offenders who will use the internet to get ideas for their next assault and hook up with like-minded offenders. But of course, such offenders could also obtain recipes for offending just from the web-sites, without having to link up with other offenders.<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of those using the internet, recent studies show (as you might expect) that offenders who stick solely to internet porn are better educated and have sometimes quite sophisticated computer skills. This raises the interesting question of how many offenders who (e.g.) assault children do NOT use internet porn. One observation that has been made repeatedly over the years is that child molesters are very good at creating porn out of seemingly harmless material e.g. underwear ads in magazines, pictures of kids in pyjamas in supermarket catalogues, and (chillingly enough) endless watching of certain children&#039;s movies (&quot;Home Alone&quot; seems to be a perennial favourite). The children depicted in this material are easily (in the offender&#039;s mind) made into the subject of deviant fantasy. This is why the Australia Institute condemned David Jones a few years ago for its &quot;corporate paedophilia&quot; for portraying subtly sexualised images of young girls in its kids&#039; clothing catalogues. Perhaps, in this sense, we are all complicit in allowing/encouraging such images to become common-place ... my own view is that, overall, they probably do far more damage than frank child porn in terms of promoting exploitative views in our society of childhood sexuality.<br /><br />*** end Dr Glaser ***<br /><br />Dr Glaser’s views that stereotypes often do not hold true correspond with those of the Australian Institute of Criminology.&nbsp; In its paper ‘Misperceptions about child sex offenders’ the Institute states:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all child sex offenders are ‘paedophiles’. That is, child sex offenders are a heterogeneous group with varying offender profiles;<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children are usually abused by someone they know, although data suggest that strangers comprise nearly one in five perpetrators of child sexual abuse against males;<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all child sex offenders have been victims of sexual abuse themselves and there are complex relationships between being a victim of child sexual abuse and becoming a perpetrator, which require further research. It is important to recognise that while many offenders report a history of being sexually abused, most victims of child sexual abuse do not become perpetrators later in life;<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while not all child sex offenders have high rates of recidivism, a specific subset—those who target extrafamilial male children—do frequently reoffend; and<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;although it is difficult to accurately determine how many children a child sex offender has already offended against by the time he is detected for an offence, this number varies according to offending profiles and is unlikely to be as high as is commonly assumed. There is, however, a subset of extrafamilial male offenders who abuse high numbers of victims.<br /><br />It all raises some interesting questions.&nbsp; Should someone who masturbates to the picture of a child in a bathtub be considered a criminal?&nbsp; What about the person who uploads that picture, knowing it will be used for sexual gratification?&nbsp; Are people still hysterical about ‘stranger danger’ when all the evidence shows that it is within their own families they should be looking for sex offenders?<br /><br />

Our freedom gives us the freedom to not allow some things in this world not to be shared or freely seen.

That stuff is better enforced in family not by government or external society. Also there is a lot of scientific evidence that shows pedophiles with access to CP are less likely to molest children, for every paper you can cite that leans one way I can cite another going the other. I guess at that point you just need to look at the credentials of the people publishing.

What if I multiply two illegal numbers together, is the resulting number illegal?? In a way you are trying to enforce something that can not even be defined. I actually hope that someone encodes a CP image into a sequence of English characters and publishes it as a book ! Then they can want to burn the books and that is a more fitting image of their mentality. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s what I disagree about though, saying that a technical aspect of cp is what they want to illegalize is wrong, that&#039;s like saying they want to illegalize computer screens because that&#039;s what they used to show the images or if you want to go further we may as well start talking about the bad apples in the table of elements, only what those numbers are portraying matters in the end, if you multiplied those numbers together and they didn&#039;t show cp then no one would care, if you added 1 to one of the numbers and it showed a blank screen no one would care, if they continued to show cp then people would care.<br /><br />edit: to ozfreelancer, I couldn&#039;t care less if they jack off to pictures of kids at the beach, it&#039;s just the psychological scarring of children involved in the videos that we&#039;re actually talking about here that I find abhorrent.&nbsp; In the end though it&#039;s a complex issue and I really have no idea what&#039;s right so I&#039;ll just quit posting now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I personally agree I think everyone with /dev/urandom should be arrested if they keep getting output from it long enough ;)

In fact I am sure there are plenty of individuals here who would love to speak on behalf of the community in telling me that I am completely fucking insane , and that my opinions are radically different from the opinions in the consensuses they have taken. <br /><br />That said I am not particularly interested in pictures of Petey getting fisted, but if someone else is I certainly do not see that as reason to harm them , or even as a particularly big deal all , although in an academic sense it is rather interesting I guess 0_0 . Huh I wonder why someone could get off to pictures of a 5 year old being fisted. I sure don&#039;t see the attraction there! But so fucking what as long as they are not fisting five year olds it is really none of my business I guess :/

In the United States, despite the First Amendment, there is at least one case I have heard of where a Minnesota man, one Frank McCoy, was prosecuted for &#039;obscenity&#039;, specifically writing fictional stories which were posted to a number of Internet story sharing sites. Although he lives in Minnesota, the government was unable to get a judge to accept the case there.&nbsp; The Feds went both jurisdiction-shopping as well as judge-shopping, trying again in one of the most conservative regions of one of the most conservative states in the Union, Georgia. McCoy was tried in January 2010, and the verdict is still pending.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh yes, I agree wholeheartedly - I read about the guy who had his laptop seized going into Canada because he had anime/manga on his hdd and they considered it to be cp :rolleyes:<br /><br />I am shocked about the other story you mentioned though, I hadn&#039;t heard that one.

E.g. some recent studies seem to show that many child porn users have reasonably OK relationships, are not desperate loners searching for approval/companionship and have reasonably effective non-sexual ways of dealing with &quot;stress&quot;.<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly, a substantial proportion of child-porn users (perhaps the majority) do NOT engage in contact sexual offending with children (although, of course, this finding should be interpreted with caution given the huge under-reporting of sexual assault of children)<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as importantly, offenders who only use&nbsp; child porn without going on to assault children seem to have a higher level of deviant sexual fantasies and an increased tendency to hold distorted views of children as sexual beings, compared to those offenders who actually assault kids. This finding is, of course, counter-intuitive at one level but at another level it makes sense: most males (and I apologise for my gender here) experience all sorts of bizarre and horrifying sexual fantasies at some stage but the majority do not act on them. In other words there really does seem to be a &quot;disconnect&quot; between sexual thoughts and sexual behaviours with no good correlation linking the two.<br /><br />So, in terms of your questions:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be possible that for some offenders, contact with other offenders over the internet could help to &quot;normalise&quot; and validate their experiences. After all, despite what I pointed out earlier, one would expect potential offenders who are not well-integrated into the community to seek out, and accept, moral approval for their The key question is: what is being normalised? Having deviant fantasies (in the same way as Star Trek characters and stories are normalised at a Star Trek convention, while everybody realises that they are still just fantasies)? Or acting on the behaviours depicted in the porn (which is, of course, much more sinister)?<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact with other offenders over the internet probably increases the use of internet and other child porn. Whether it increases the risk of sexual assaults on children is simply not known. My guess is that it probably does, simply because there are always going to be particularly nasty offenders who will use the internet to get ideas for their next assault and hook up with like-minded offenders. But of course, such offenders could also obtain recipes for offending just from the web-sites, without having to link up with other offenders.<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of those using the internet, recent studies show (as you might expect) that offenders who stick solely to internet porn are better educated and have sometimes quite sophisticated computer skills. This raises the interesting question of how many offenders who (e.g.) assault children do NOT use internet porn. One observation that has been made repeatedly over the years is that child molesters are very good at creating porn out of seemingly harmless material e.g. underwear ads in magazines, pictures of kids in pyjamas in supermarket catalogues, and (chillingly enough) endless watching of certain children&#039;s movies (&quot;Home Alone&quot; seems to be a perennial favourite). The children depicted in this material are easily (in the offender&#039;s mind) made into the subject of deviant fantasy. This is why the Australia Institute condemned David Jones a few years ago for its &quot;corporate paedophilia&quot; for portraying subtly sexualised images of young girls in its kids&#039; clothing catalogues. Perhaps, in this sense, we are all complicit in allowing/encouraging such images to become common-place ... my own view is that, overall, they probably do far more damage than frank child porn in terms of promoting exploitative views in our society of childhood sexuality.<br /><br />*** end Dr Glaser ***<br /><br />Dr Glaser’s views that stereotypes often do not hold true correspond with those of the Australian Institute of Criminology.&nbsp; In its paper ‘Misperceptions about child sex offenders’ the Institute states:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all child sex offenders are ‘paedophiles’. That is, child sex offenders are a heterogeneous group with varying offender profiles;<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children are usually abused by someone they know, although data suggest that strangers comprise nearly one in five perpetrators of child sexual abuse against males;<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all child sex offenders have been victims of sexual abuse themselves and there are complex relationships between being a victim of child sexual abuse and becoming a perpetrator, which require further research. It is important to recognise that while many offenders report a history of being sexually abused, most victims of child sexual abuse do not become perpetrators later in life;<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while not all child sex offenders have high rates of recidivism, a specific subset—those who target extrafamilial male children—do frequently reoffend; and<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;although it is difficult to accurately determine how many children a child sex offender has already offended against by the time he is detected for an offence, this number varies according to offending profiles and is unlikely to be as high as is commonly assumed. There is, however, a subset of extrafamilial male offenders who abuse high numbers of victims.<br /><br />It all raises some interesting questions.&nbsp; Should someone who masturbates to the picture of a child in a bathtub be considered a criminal?&nbsp; What about the person who uploads that picture, knowing it will be used for sexual gratification?&nbsp; Are people still hysterical about ‘stranger danger’ when all the evidence shows that it is within their own families they should be looking for sex offenders?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just wanted to say a massive thank you for adding an independent, objective and informative post to this discussion. I would +karma you several times over if I could!<br /><br />One point that stood out to me that I found very interesting, was &quot;not all child molesters are paedophiles&quot;. I always presumed that &quot;not all paedophiles are child molesters&quot; in the same way that &quot;not all furries are animal abusers&quot;, but I&#039;d never considered it the other way around. Child molestation and paedophilia go hand-in-hand where the media and propaganda are concerned, they make it impossible to distinguish between the two.

We don&#039;t allow these things because we don&#039;t allow the people who do such things, to live amongst us. It isn&#039;t and shouldn&#039;t be tolerated in any form.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It may be abhorrent to you (and me, for that matter), but being offended by it isn&#039;t a reason to make it illegal. <br /><br />Using your logic, all art/literature containing depictions of murder are illegal. We don&#039;t allow fictitious murder, because we don&#039;t allow the people who do such things to live amongst us. How about depictions of rape/torture/violent attacks? (I guess there&#039;s going to be a lot less murder-mystery novels and blockbusters coming out). How about assault/kidnapping/armed robbery/theft/drug use/drunk driving/jaywalking, where do you draw the line? Freedom of expression exists for a reason. Ultimately, it&#039;s not harming anyone, so there&#039;s no reason for any government involvement.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I do believe in the ideal of freedom of expression. But I don&#039;t see why you find it hard it draw the line? The line is CP. I can&#039;t think (off the top of my head) of anything else that should be censored. I would even allow depictions of (adult) rape or murder, but that entirely depends on context. Have you seen the film Reversible? Censorship (in particular film censorship) is of great interest to me. But really to make that leap from banning cp to therefore banning murder-mystery novels and blockbusters? That isn&#039;t what I am saying. Is it that hard to see that cp has nothing to add culturally or artistically or intellectually to society? And freedom of expression is a means, not an end.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Perhaps I find it difficult to draw the line because I&#039;m trying to be objective and non-judgemental. I realise it&#039;s hard to do this without looking like an apologist. Ultimately, it&#039;s one of the most emotional topics that can be discussed and emotions are bound to be heightened, but unfortunately emotions cloud judgement.<br /><br />The problem with &quot;drawing the line&quot; is that it&#039;s based entirely on your own feelings and opinions and not on &quot;what is right/fair&quot;. Ultimately, if an action does not harm any person, then that action does not need to be made illegal. I&#039;d consider that to be a fair, rational and logical statement.<br /><br />Giving governments the power to determine what should/shouldn&#039;t be illegal is what has lead us to the slippery slope we&#039;re on today - scare tactics in the media, loss of liberties, loss of privacy, loss of personal freedoms, etc. Governments are corrupt creatures that will weasel their way into society, offering rainbows and joy to the people in one hand, while slapping on shackles and manacles with the other. When governments get involved, &quot;making the leap&quot; from cp to blockbusters isn&#039;t such a gigantic leap - I don&#039;t know about you, but here in the UK we&#039;ve already had a few ridiculous stories of photographers being hounded by police or arrested for possessing innocent photographs of children, even photographers who have taken school photos have been subject to ridiculous measures such as blanking out the faces of certain children in copies of anyone&#039;s photos but the parents of the child in question! There are plenty of ridiculous stories like these floating around. How about children/early teens who are being investigated for &quot;distributing cp&quot; because they were &quot;sexting&quot; nude photos of themselves to their boyfriends/girlfriends?<br /><br />Additionally, you say that cp has nothing to add culturally, artistically or intellectually to society - I&#039;d wholeheartedly disagree. Bear in mind that with that statement, I am referencing fictitious drawings and literature, NOT images of real child abuse. How about the novel &quot;Lolita&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov? &quot;Lost Girls&quot; by Alan Moore? There are probably many others, but I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s a topic i&#039;m not well-versed in.

People were convicted of child abuse on the basis of the flimsiest, most outrageous &#039;evidence&#039; ever introduced into a courtroom.&nbsp; As author and researcher Debbie Nathan said in a Salon article, &quot;Why I Need To See Child Porn&quot;: <br /><br />&quot;...That leaves law-enforcement officials and politicians free to say whatever they want about the prevalence and content of images deemed child pornography, with virtually no way for the public to test claims,” <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 for another awesome point made.

				Really what I prefer to jack off to is completely irrelevant to any argument I have made. That said please enjoy your witch hunts. Also I would not need to feel any worry if I were into CP, even the NSA would have trouble to locate someone who used spoofed mac random WiFi access points for short periods of time + Tor + avoided positioning attacks by not carrying phones or using a car. I could collect a trillion terabytes of CP without any of it being possible to link to me unless I was the target of a completely unprecedented operation close to what intelligence agencies would hope to do if they tried their best. However, I have no interest in collecting terabytes of CP.. but I think it pretty much goes to show that fear of being apprehended for CP is not why I think CP should be legal to view. FBI can&#039;t even trace hidden services who the fuck is worried about them&nbsp; (&lt;_&lt;)<br /><br />

Anyway, I don&#039;t have to look at CP, and I actually refrain from doing so as I find it to either be extremely pointless to look at even if it is not disgusting and doesn&#039;t strike me as particularly offensive, or in many cases entirely disgusting and upsetting. That said, I really couldn&#039;t give a fuck less what other people look at and I find it to be rather troubling that so many people give so much of a fuck about what others look at. There is clearly no magic re-victimization process, nobody who is victimized in the making of CP would necessarily even know that people were looking at it if the police didn&#039;t tell them every time they bust someone, if you believe the highly dubious claim that people looking at CP fuels the CP market through demand then there are PIR systems that can cryptographically hide the demand, etc. It just doesn&#039;t strike me as a big deal if someone looks at a picture of anything, I am much more worried by peoples desire to do horrible things to people who do something as completely neutral as looking at an arrangement of colored pixels. Additionally, I think that if jailbait porn was legal that a fucking lot of people who claim to be against CP would be watching it all the time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Forgive me if I post this before reading the entire thread.&nbsp; I just had to respond to this now...<br /><br />As we experience things in life, our minds get used to these things and accept them as part of us.&nbsp; Regardless of whether you like them or not, the things you&#039;ve seen and experienced are in your mind.&nbsp; As with porn and violence, the more you experience things, the more you get used to them, and sometimes begin to enjoy them.<br /><br />The difference in porn between the 80&#039;s and now is a perfect example.&nbsp; If we&#039;d shown todays hardcore porn to our brothers in the 80&#039;s they&#039;d either get freaked out or blow an instant load in their pants.&nbsp; Their stuff was story driven, and hairy.&nbsp; Boring to us today.<br /><br />My first horror film was Poltergeist, and at 8 years old I was pretty scared of clown toys after that.&nbsp; By the time I was 17 though, I was watching crazy gory horror films, and actually thought they were funny because of the bad effects.<br /><br />If you look at too much CP, you&#039;re going to start liking it... and then you will want to start making it, or experiencing it, because kids turns your crank.&nbsp; Then I&#039;m gonna show up at your house with a blowtorch and some gummy bears, and your ass is going to be tortured.<br /><br />Hell, I&#039;d even take some engineering classes so I could make the biggest steeley dan I could find for your ass.<br /><br />The victim may not be harmed by you looking at their past suffering, but you are sick fucks for looking at it repeatedly, and DO create a market where people will want to create it to show off.&nbsp; There are poor fuckers SELLING their kids to pedophiles just for this shit.&nbsp; Looking at CP intentionally, repeatedly, makes you a pedophile.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; You are scum of the earth.<br /><br />There is nothing worse than harming children.&nbsp; Nothing.<br /><br />Kids are fucking innocent.&nbsp; Let them lose their innocence on their own.&nbsp; Don&#039;t fuck with them.&nbsp; Do us all a favour and shoot yourself in the face if you think it&#039;s ok to fuck with kids.

Pornography addicts overwhelmingly outnumber pedophiles as far as CP possession is concerned. If you disagree with me I can dig up some offender taxonomies from law enforcement, amazingly some of them seem to have accurate understanding of the sociology of the CP market. <br /><br />There is pretty ample evidence that pornography addicts very rarely cross over from fantasy to actually acting out the fantasies in porn, so although the porn they view will likely become increasingly more depraved over time (or eventually hitting a stable level somewhere), they are no more threats to society than if they never became desensitized past looking at softcore adult porn. There is actually ample evidence that pedophiles are not as likely to be involved with CP as you would think, they are more involved with actually molesting children. Certainly even the largest producers of CP&nbsp; were motivated out of financial desire more so than out of pedophile tendencies. I never claim that it should be okay to pay for children to be molested, simply that it should not be illegal to look at images, however even thinking that payment for CP images might be immoral is less a libertarian view than the ACLU takes on CP, and less than most anarchists would take as well, who would be more likely to say that there is a difference between paying for a child to be molested and paying for an image of a molested child. I have more trouble to see that distinction.

				Today as I sat on the train, I thought about some of the points we&#039;ve discussed here, and it&#039;s prompted me to write this, my final post on this subject.<br /><br />I believe you can&#039;t stop someone thinking about children in a sexual way and lusting over images, or actual children (on a day-to-day basis, I&#039;m not talking about therapy). People have tried. In the UK (and probably elsewhere) members of the public and even parents can no longer film their child&#039;s school play or sports day. In the mistaken belief of preventing pedos from using such images for their own private pleasure. If you follow this idea to it&#039;s ultimate conclusion, then children would have to be completely separated from all adults and raised by robots in orphanages, out of sight of prying eyes, until they reached the age of consent. Unfortunately we just have to except someone maybe looking at our children and thinking sexual thoughts.<br /><br />Also, if a pedo makes his (or her) own drawings or writings for the purpose of their own sexual needs, I believe we really can&#039;t (in any productive way) stop them. But (and here&#039;s my point), what we should focus on trying to stop is the DISTRIBUTION of these pornographic items.Because the availability of such items feeds the fire of their disgusting desires and helps to build a community that supports their own beliefs and encourages their own behavior. As I&#039;ve said before, these images are not tolerated in a civilized society. And to distribute them elevates it from the personal problem, to a problem for society.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that if a pedo draws some CP for his own gratification and keeps it to himself and doesn&#039;t distribute it, then that&#039;s OK. No. I believe this is a personal problem of the pedo&#039;s and should be addressed with therapy maybe, where he/she can be assessed for how much of a threat they are to children, and dealt with accordingly. Whereas, a pedo distributing CP either publicly or privately, can be censored (in the case of public distribution) and dealt with by criminal prosecution. With the intent of such policing efforts directed at firstly protecting children, but also with stopping any sort of pedo society from forming and maintaining the public decency.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;ll elaborate on what I meant by &quot;freedom of expression is a means, and not an end&quot;. Some people argue that CP and other such divisive material should be allowed because freedom of expression should be an absolute ideal, and therefore include all forms of expression, whether we approve of them or not. I find this an attractive ideal, but feel it&#039;s untenable in reality. We should aspire to the freedom of expression but not be dogmatic about it. It&#039;s a useful idea to rationalize an argument, but not an answer in off itself. I believe the CP discussion demonstrates this quiet well.<br /><br />If TL;DR then I can&#039;t really condense this, sorry.<br /><br />Anyway, some coke beckons me away. So, I&#039;ll shut up finally on this subject :-X. Peace to everyone who argued their point, I found this quiet thought provoking. :)
