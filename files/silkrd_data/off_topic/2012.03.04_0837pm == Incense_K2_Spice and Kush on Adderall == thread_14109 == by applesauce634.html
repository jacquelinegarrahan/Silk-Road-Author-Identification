				I know this is my third topic posted in a fairly short amount of time, but the adderall is just screaming &quot;do something!&quot;, so I will ;)<br />&amp; If it seems like there&#039;s a lot of rambling, it&#039;s really lengthy, or it&#039;s hard to read, ^ that is why. So I apologize in advance -.^<br /><br />What are your guys&#039; thoughts about the synthetic weed? <br />To be completely honest it&#039;s the only &quot;form of weed&quot; that I&#039;ve ever smoked. (Only because I could easily get it, it was way cheaper, and it doesn&#039;t show up in tests.) However, the more I smoke it and the more I read about it, the more scared I get. Note: I have stopped smoking it; I will never touch the stuff again. <br />I know it hasn&#039;t been tested that much, and I know we simply don&#039;t know what is in it.&nbsp; <br />I saw a thing on slashdot about how a recent test discovered that sleeping pills increases your risk of cancer (what doesn&#039;t lol) and shortens your life span. (If taken daily.) After reading that it hit me, I never thought about long term effects of incense, only the short term. (Which from what we know are still really bad in themselves.) The more I thought, the more I realized how bad it is. Anything could go wrong, from a severe case of cancer, to a brain tumor, to straight up death.<br />I&#039;ve even heard (just from friends) that every gram you smoke puts a tablespoon of blood in your lungs or something like that. They also said if you didn&#039;t smoke it too often you would be fine, and the blood would gradually &quot;filter out&quot;. (I didn&#039;t take any of that into account. Hell, they were probably stoned as fuck when they said that.)<br /><br />So what do you guys think about it, and what have you guys heard?<br /><br />-------------------<br />Q2<br /><br />AND since I also wanted to ask this but don&#039;t feel it&#039;s necessary to start a whole new thread (so it doesn&#039;t look like I&#039;m spamming,) have you guys ever gotten high while either: adderall kicks in, adderall is in effect, or adderall is wearing off (during a come down.) And if so, what did you guys think?<br />Personally I&#039;ve smoked once while having a come down and once while it was still working. <br />During the come down I had a REALLY bad high. The bad parts of the adderall and the adderall come down and the bad parts of being high mixed. Basically I was on edge, paranoid, NOT hungry, nautious (can&#039;t spell lol), depressed, and suicidal. Needless to say it was a super shitty night, and I never fell asleep. To top it off I had been skipping class a bunch and would have been fucked if I missed another day; so I dragged myself in the shower, recklessly drove myself, and went to class. Longest day EVER. <br />My second time the high was great; the two complimented each other. I was super focused, super happy, my senses were all different (like when on weed) and all in all it was amazing. <br />Since then I haven&#039;t been around any weed while on adderall so I haven&#039;t been able to do it ;p But HOPEFULLY I will soon ;p<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ahhh seriously, switch to real weed :) Especially since you&#039;re at SR!<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit stoned but I&#039;ll try to answer your questions as well as I can.<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;ve smoked while on Adderall and I always smoke coming down. I can&#039;t really comment too much on whether or not it impacts the high - I just smoke until I feel high and I&#039;ve never failed to &#039;get there&#039; so...I imagine your problems are cause it&#039;s spice...<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point - I&#039;m really not a fan. I have a spice phase over christmas and at first I thought it was great, but I found it really short acting, and then one night (new year) I smoked a tiny bit, and then drank, and then I had a headache for DAYS, like the worst headache I&#039;ve ever felt. Honestly, you really should just go for some real, top quality weed :) And vape it - alllllll gooood!!<br /><br />PS. I have adderall envy - I so need some right now :)

				Yeah, I&#039;ve told myself I&#039;m NEVER smoking incense again; I&#039;m only smoking the real stuff from here on out. I always just always had a hard time getting any real weed, but SR should definitely make that a lot easier :)&nbsp; I&#039;ve just never bought anything like that before and I&#039;m kind of nervous about getting busted D:<br /><br />And I really wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the reason I had a bad high was because of the fake weed. I&#039;ve heard of other people reporting the same thing, but I have NO idea what they were smoking.<br /><br />And hehe :) I have had for a while so I annoyed my friend until he would advance me some ;p Needless to say I owe him :D (Gonna buy him a gfx invite on here and pay him with that.) <br />And I also plan on selling some when I can afford to become a seller, I just don&#039;t know when that&#039;s gonna be. (Trying to convince my friends to go in on it with me, telling them I can sell for them and they could easily make their money back.) But yeah, once I become a seller and I have some extras in stock I PLAN on selling them for $1.25 or $1.50 / 10 mg of XR plus shipping. (I get them for $1/10.) <br />I&#039;m just EXTREMELY afraid about getting/sending drugs through the mail.
