				I am looking for work right now during the summer, but so far i am not finding anything. I am going back to college in the fall for finance, and I want to get a job, but here is the thing: I want to leave the US. I have been looking into the shortage of finance grads in Mexico, so that is an option. In addition, I want to have decent pay, and low cost of living, so I can build wealth, perhaps even offshore and live out the flag theory. There is no way I could do this in Chicago or New York or Toronto ( the finance centers), but there was an interesting twist. I was looking for foreign jobs and ran across the State Department website for expats. This led me to the idea of maybe joining the State Department as a foreign service officer . I feel mixed, but if things continue the way they are, I might be better off joining. With a bachelors degree, you start at $40,000 a year at least, with housing and benefits. What do you&#039;s think? Any ideas besides that for building wealth and reducing expenses?

				as an officer they will background check you and make you submit to a polygraph.<br /><br />100% chance of them asking you about previous criminal activity/drug use on said polygraph

				Well, since I have never done any drugs, and have never been caught doing anything, I am in the clear. The only thing devious is running a hidden service. On that, do you think it would be a good idea under that circumstance? Should I forget about other people&#039;s freedom in exchange for my own if they don&#039;t even care about freedom? Or should I forgo that and go the long route?
