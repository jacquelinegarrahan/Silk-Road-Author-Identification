				This insult was said to one of my best friends, deservedly, and we&#039;re not very friendly anymore&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />&quot;You&#039;ve got more money than brains. You spend before you think. That&#039;s the difference between you and me. I&#039;ve got more brains than money... and I&#039;ve got more money than you. So do the math.&quot;<br /><br />This was after he lost me $2500 on a bad, obviously not thought out, &quot;business&quot; deal.

				Best insult? <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard and said many insults in my short life but the one that I will always remember?<br /><br />6th grade, I was best friends with a girl, something had happened between us or our group of friends that made us not on speaking terms. Sometime later that week she came up to me at lunch time and said<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m sorry&quot;<br /><br />Here I am thinking that this was the greatest thing that could ever happen to me, I was going to be friends again! plus I had a bit of a crush so I was just putty in those first couple of words....<br /><br />&quot;For ever being your friend&quot;<br /><br /><br />My world around me came crashing down, and it was at this point that I realized that yes, even in 6th grade, woman are the downfall of man.
