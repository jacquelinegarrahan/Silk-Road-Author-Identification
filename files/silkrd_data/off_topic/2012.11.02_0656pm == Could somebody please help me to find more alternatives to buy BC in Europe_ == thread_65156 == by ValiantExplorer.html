				So far, I found nothing. BitInstant only offers coupons. LocalBitCoin has outrageous prices.<br /><br />My only option remains MTGOX, which I am, for now, unsure if it accepts purchases via debit card. Other than this, I got no idea how I can purchase them.<br /><br />I learned a lot about how to launder them and stuff, but surprise surprise, I&#039;m not able to buy any, LOL :D.

				I ve tried both otc and bitstamp, they re both good. I prefer bitstamp because it&#039;s easier and you dont have to build trust etc.<br />SEPA transfer, it takes about 3-4 days for the money to show up in your account. And 5 minutes more to trade them for coins :)

				Apparently BitStamp doesn&#039;t require verification (submission of legal documents) for SEPA transfers, unlike MTGox and others. This is really awesome!

				Hmmm, interesting one. Seems like it these BitCoins would also be cleaner than from MTGox because they come from another user. A bit pricy but, it could work nicely. Thanks.<br /><br />Question: estimated time for an order to be completed?<br /><br />Question: can you transfer funds via debit card?

				Thanks again Ballzinator. Do you also happen to know if they require papers (legal documents) for SEPA transfers like MTGox and OkPay do?

For example you can show them your eBay account and if that account has a lot of positive feedback your BitMarket account gets &quot;unlocked&quot;.
