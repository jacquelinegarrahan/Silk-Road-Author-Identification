				The weed I get where I live isn&#039;t great, but it&#039;s not terrible expensive. On the silk road an eight of an ounce is selling for 60 USD, which seems pretty damned expensive. My weed source seems to have dried up at least temporarily and I was thinking about getting it off here. However, at 60 dollars for an eighth I may just turn to drinking excessively instead. So tell me, is the weed worth it? Is it really that good that an eight should last me a few weeks using a vape?

				I can&#039;t buy 8&#039;s anymore.<br />Lasts like two days, maybe 8)<br />Too much overhead in fees now.<br />OZ&#039;s or better.<br /><br />You can find cheaper 8&#039;s just have to look. Sales this week.<br /><br />No it&#039;s too expensive.<br />Unless you grow it yourself.<br />You have the vendor&#039;s price + all the unknown fees added(unless you want to break out the calculator), shipping, etc.<br />This is why I support posting fees, and BTC rate at checkout. ;D<br />So a $40 8&#039;s cost $60, that figure is a disingenuous as well. <br />So it&#039;s more like $65, plus whatever fee you lost converting Money to BTC.<br />Now it&#039;s $70........<br /><br /><br />Yes, I still buy it. ::)<br />Cause it&#039;s that good ;)<br />

				With my new-found vendor apreciation, I ask you, have you ever packaged an eighth?<br />I don&#039;t know about some vendors, but it takes me quite some time to get a package done because of how thorough I am. When you are dealing with small amounts, and there isn&#039;t as much money to be made, the price is jacked up to reflect that. If you want a deal, buy halfs and ounces. If you aren&#039;t wiling to pay $150/half for top grade bud, then I&#039;m not sure what to say. Maybe smoking isn&#039;t your thing.

				It&#039;s not worth it when you buy small amounts from the road.<br />Packaging is expensive for good vendors, so smaller amounts would cost more and some vendors with good cheap bud don&#039;t even sell eighths.<br /><br />Usually you can find an ounce of dank bud from a trusted vendor at a maximum of 300 bucks after bitcoin buying fees. If it&#039;s over 300, you either haven&#039;t found a good vendor or you&#039;re getting ripped off by a trusted vendor with exuberantly high prices.

				So the consensus seems to be that it&#039;s reasonably priced when you&#039;re buying in ounces. I need some money in my coffers then.

				some of the bulk prices here are actually quite competitive, but yes the prices on small amounts are outrageous.&nbsp; you can buy bulk and sell half of it to your friends for a slightly jacked up price and they will be happy just to have weed and you will be smoking for free (or almost free, depending on how much you sell).

				Bulk is where it&#039;s at. Multiple ounces if you can do it. Find some good friends and go in together on a QP. You can flip it and smoke for free and have enough to buy more.

				Home grown cannabis is WAY too expensive and the price has crept up from £90 in the 90s to over £200 on the street.<br /><br />Anyone smoking a fair bit of weed ought to grow for their own personal use. For the price an oz costs here you could buy a grow tent, light, extractors, filter and other assorted bits and pieces. <br /><br />Some folk are lucky to know a few growers but outside of that the average punter is paying top dollar because small growers make the profit selling outside of friends and family. Weed grown on a small scale by a grower who has 15 years or more growing under the belt is worth the high price.<br /><br />Also many of us here NEVER see good hash outside of Amsterdam (and even there you have to be careful) so its &#039;worth&#039; buying 3.5 grams of hashes that are for us rare treats! Sure they are pricey but I bet even the farmers in remote areas of the globe are demanding more dollar. Hash is a one off that differs from harvest to harvest. I do a gree that some prices are just silly. I&#039;ve seen hash going for 5 bitcoins - not ice-o-lator hash just imported. No way is a gram of ANY hash worth almost £15.50. That&#039;s just greed IMO. I could not see any vendor buying hash that cost almost £300 per ounce. Ice-o-lator hash (water and ice extracted hash) is almost pure THC glands so maybe that would bring a mad price.<br /><br />The BEST hash is the growers own made from trimmings and small airy buds. I prefer dry sieved hash to the water extracted. <br /><br />I admit the best deals here are for 100 grams and above with the hash.<br /><br />One things always makes me amused. The fact remains that bud contains about 20% resin glands at most. So if you see a gram of hash on sale for 3 BTC - and a gram of bud going for 3BTC also - the hash should always be a better bargain! Science says so! 80% of the bud is just carbon based nothingness!<br /><br />Sometimes the UK gets cheap and nasty imported weed that has obviously been used to make hash prior to it being compressed. Even some Dutch weed has been sifted of hash prior to it being compressed. The resin heads are missing and only the stalks remain which still leaves a decent weed.<br /><br />Some sellers will shake an ounce of the glands - and sell on the weed which will be minus 3 grams or so on average for a short shake to grab the best glands.<br /><br />Good weed is worth the price. You are paying for all the hours a grower puts in plus the risk also.<br /><br />Commercial weed ought to be dirt cheap really.<br /><br />Then again I think that if a joint is the same price as a pint of beer then its good. <br /><br />Sorry for the long reply but its like pillow talk here sometimes. All the confessing and reminiscences.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)
