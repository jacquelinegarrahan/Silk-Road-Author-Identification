				Hi, i&#039;m planning on buying 10 acid hits from nipplesuckcanuck (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/index.php/silkroad/item/7370108578) and maybe some other items too. I was doing a little research on buying bitcoins and came to a conclusion that the only way for me to buy bitcoins is via western union. so i was wondering, can someone who is experienced with paying for bitcoins through western union direct me to somewhere legit where i can buy cheap bitcoins? i tried to find something like this on my own, but all i found were shady websites that charge way above mtgox price and sellers on this site that i wasn&#039;t sure how to tell if they were legit or not.<br />also, i&#039;m familiar with this site for a little under a year but i have never really bought anything with bitcoins, so be patient with me.<br /><br />Thnaks :)

				I am also a noob to the site. I have only purchased bitcoins twice, both times have been through moneygram at CVS. I deposit using the service &#039;Bitinstant&#039; which takes 4% of the amount (in USD) of BC you deposit. You also have to pay a small fee to ZipZap (the company that actually gives you the BC). They do ask for your information, but I don&#039;t think it serves any major purposes, as I have used fake information both times, with no problem. Yes, there are a couple of fees tacked on for doing it this way, but it&#039;s worth the convenience of being able to walk into your local CVS, 7-11, or Wal-Mart and have the bitcoins in your wallet by the time you get home. It doesn&#039;t get any easier than that. I&#039;m also one of the most paranoid individuals in the world and after getting the first time jitters out, it&#039;s now a cake walk in and out.
