				I don&#039;t expect all of this from one person, im just hoping i get bits and chunks from a lot of people so i feel safer, more at ease, and actually know what im doing.<br /><br />Alright i&#039;ll start with this the smaller stuff, if i ordered a package and it never shows up, am i able to get the $ back/ will the escrow system really do anything other than make the faulty vendor wait an extra 10-15 days?<br /><br />next, Obviously i&#039;d never sign for a package, but what would happen if my shipment gets caught in the mail? I would obviously deny it but whats a good defense, i&#039;d probably say i didnt order it, plied the 5th and find a lawyer, but does anyone have any legal advice, or could present me with the most likely scenario of what might happen?<br /><br />On top of that how many people on SR really get in trouble, because of people that quit/retire it&#039;s defiantly going to be hard to say for sure, but do a good amount of people get caught or is it just a small fraction?<br /><br />should i use anonymous.org or a proxy site like that to try and be &quot;safer&quot; while browsing the deep web? <br />i&#039;ve seen lots of other security posts and can defiantly just follow those for other things, i just don&#039;t know if anonymous.org would actually be helpful or just an annoying waste of time.<br /><br />other than that all i want to know is approximately how long it would generally take to receive a package in New York from California/ the west coast, from Canada to New york, and from The Netherlands/ UK to NY?<br />Also is it a lot safer to order domestic only, or is it more about the packaging and who&#039;s taking care of it?<br /><br />Any recommended ways to receive BTC? Its getting sketchier and sketchier to get greendot moneypaks at walmart for me, im just looking for the safest way that won&#039;t charge huge rates. There is a BTC exchange company in New York City i could go to, but i&#039;d only want to do this for very large amounts, and i feel like it&#039;d be even riskier because im not sure what data they&#039;d have on me.

Gox, CryptoXChange, or some other similar service to actually buy the coins).&nbsp; I understand that BitInstant is &quot;faster,&quot; but GetBitcoin always takes &lt;24 hours for me.&nbsp; I think both places charge 5% fees.

				thanks appa! you&#039;re basically a boss answering all of that. <br /><br />i have another question i might as well throw into this thread, im sure countless people do the same thing. Hooking other people up and getting it sent to them, more or less dangerous? I obviously don&#039;t let them make it public and only talk in person about it, or if they&#039;re really annoying i&#039;ll let them call me because your calls are protected (one party has to know if a conversation is recorded) I&#039;ve only actually done that once and thats what i&#039;m still waiting to arrive... theyre getting pissed and its annoying--- they don&#039;t have any idea what my source is

You should stick to discussing things using programs like Gibberbot or TextSecure or CSipSimple! Do not discuss drug transactions over any unencrypted voice conversation. It&#039;s all being recorded.<br /><br />Hooking other people up that way is a GREAT idea, if you know the other person is smart and doesn&#039;t have parents/roommates/etc. that will call the police on them. You really don&#039;t want to order tons of small orders to your house if you&#039;re selling drugs... if the police catch wind of your in person sales, they could conduct surveillance on you and your property and discover that mail comes in, and you then go to customers&#039; houses to sell the drugs. Just get your friends to receive the packages, make sure to use their real full names, tell them to keep their fucking mouths shut about how they get their drugs, and charge them a nice fee for your handling the bitcoin+Tor+reading vendor reviews and making wise decisions on who to order from. If done judiciously, this is safer for you and all the sellers you use on SR!
