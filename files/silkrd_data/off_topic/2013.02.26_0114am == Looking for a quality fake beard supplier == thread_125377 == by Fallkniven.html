				Stick to the Road. My buddy got a beard off the street and it turned out to be one of those cheap-ass RBs (research beards). Where&#039;s my buddy now? The psycho ward. He&#039;s in there, pulling at his whiskers, mumbling, masturbating furiously. <br /><br />It could happen to you.

				I can&#039;t recommend any of the current quality fake beard suppliers, there&#039;s just too much uncertainty in the marketplace and they all demand FE.&nbsp; However, I have devised an ingenious 5 step plan for anyone who wants to become their own fake beard supplier, and you don&#039;t have to be male to do this.<br /><br />Step 1 : Grow long pubes<br />Step 2 : Cut off said pubes<br />Step 3: Apply superglue to face or onto some strips of tape with glue on the other side.<br />Step 4: ?<br />Step 5: PROFIT

				Be careful and make sure you have the beard tested by a local lab right away. <br /><br />The last beard I purchased was labeled &quot;made in UK&quot;&nbsp; but upon IR analysis it was found to be made with materials only sourced in China. There was obvious adulteration with melamine which unfortunately I ingested while wearing this beard out for dinner one night along with elevated levels of the heavy metal cadmium. It turns out that the cadmium had been fed to the hair donor in China as a result of contaminated batches of the mineral supplement zinc sulphate, which was added to the donor&#039;s food. The sad part is I didn&#039;t realize anything was wrong until after wearing the beard for 48hrs straight. A rash developed from these foreign materials or was caused by the poisonous chemical diethylene glycol, and contaminated wheat gluten which had also found its way into the glue used to attached the hair. The scarring on my chin left by this is horrific. Another material found in the fibrous material of the mane was lead. I think this explains the brain damage; nervous system disorders; memory and concentration problems; I&#039;m experiencing.&nbsp; I get seizures, go unconsciousness, and I&#039;m afraid death will be coming quicker than I had hoped in my life. Sadly, the only thing the lab could find related to the UK in this beard was a mysterious DNA chain structure only found in Welsh ponies; further testing on this is required. <br /><br />Buyer&#039;s beware or you could be faced with the same trouble I am!

				awesome thread. <br /><br />Hair is unfortunately very and very very expensive. to have it crafted into a beard would cost a lot, unless you just want a santa clause beard made mostly of shitty synthetic materials.&nbsp; Look at the price of hair extensions... the price is rediculous.. but to have a proper fake beard with real hair would cost a fortune (1 grand+++). Perhpas theres some good fake substitutes,&nbsp; <br /><br />I HAVE A MUCH MUCH BETTER SOLUTION.... they have these old man masks and they are not tooooo expensive, theyre completely legit and ive seen one with my own eyes in a stage performance, theyre very skin tight though, i would feel claustophobic. if youre white though then you have option, but if youre black like myself, then you might run into problems finding an appropriate mask because of all the mixing and colours of black these days.<br /><br />Cheers.

				&quot;A beard is the collection of hair that grows on the chin, upper lip, cheeks and neck of human beings and some non-human animals. In humans, usually only pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards. However, women with hirsutism may develop a beard. When differentiating between upper and lower facial hair, a beard specifically excludes the moustache.<br />Over the course of history, men with facial hair have been ascribed various attributes such as wisdom, sexual virility, masculinity, or a higher status; however, beards may also be perceived to be associated with a lack of general cleanliness and a loss of refinement, particularly in modern times.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />So i&#039;m wise, sexually virile and masculine. I may also be perceived as being &quot;dirty&quot; and &quot;unrefined&quot;, like a bad batch of smack ;)

				Epictetus &quot;affirmed the philosopher&#039;s beard as something almost sacred...to express the idea that philosophy is no mere intellectual hobby but rather a way of life that, by definition, transforms every aspect of one&#039;s behavior, including one&#039;s shaving habits. If someone continues to shave in order to look the part of a respectable Roman citizen, it is clear that they have not yet embraced philosophy conceived as a way of life and have not yet escaped the social customs of the majority...the true philosopher will only act according to reason or according to nature, rejecting the arbitrary conventions that guide the behavior of everyone else.&quot;
