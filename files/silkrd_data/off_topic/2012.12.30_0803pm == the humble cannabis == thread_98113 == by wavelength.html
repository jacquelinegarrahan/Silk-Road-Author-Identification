				i feel this thread might just be a bit pointless :D BUT....<br />am i the only person that feels like cannabis is the number gift nature has given us? its such a god send....<br />im on amphetamine right now and i really feel as though id much rather just be chillin puffin a spliff... you can smoke cannabis at any time and it will never harm you.<br />in fact ive read studies that say cannabis can block neurotoxic effects of some drugs if smoked during an experience (mdma if i recall correctly)<br />i feel like its something every drug user should partake in, truthfully. we all need to chill every once in a while =D

				I used to smoke joints with/without (depending how much green I had left) tobacco, but now all I smoke are mincers (gravity bong). <br />I&#039;d get a mild buzz from a joint, but I get a hammering from a mincer. <br />My bowl holds 0.7g, whereas a joint has 1.2 - 2.3g&nbsp; (depending on how much tobacco).<br />Sure, mincers are coarse on the thorat, but if that&#039;s the price I pay to get hoorna minced, then so be it.&nbsp; :)

				well by spliff i dont mean a tobacco cannabis mixed joint, i simply mean a joint :D i forget that in england people think of a spliff as a mixture.<br />but i do the same as you when im super low on mary, mix it in with some tobacco and take bong rips.<br />it definitely gives you more of a &quot;buzz&quot; than just marijuana but its not always pleasant to me. tobacco can really fuck me up&nbsp; ;D

				Everything that grows in the ground or swims in the sea is a great gift. except maybe poison ivy and piranha fish.&nbsp; <br /><br />cannabis is a good gift.&nbsp; gift that keeps on giving.&nbsp; helps cancer patients &amp; might even cure cancer. <br /><br />scientists &amp; growers have even taken the high out of pot by developing strains high with CBD &amp; low with THC.&nbsp; CBD provides pain relief.&nbsp; <br /><br />humble weed &amp; miracle plant. love my sativa&nbsp; ;)

				I never put tobacco in a bowl, but after a mincer a cigarette is the only way I&#039;ve found to control my breathing, otherwise I can&#039;t stop coughing.

				&nbsp;I am not judging you for using and some people seem to be okay on it, but that doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t cause harm to others. For some people it is addictive, it can change people (get more paranoid, less memory function, less motivated, etc) and it can trigger psychosis or long term schizophrenia. Please be educated and don&#039;t be blind to both sides, it can be good and it also has potential to ruin one&#039;s life.

				i totally understand where you are coming from but i personally feel that paranoia is a side effect of almost all illegal drugs because if you were to get caught using them your government will lock you in a cage and take away your freedom.&nbsp; i have a friends that has paranoid schizophrenia and cannabis makes it worse but the main point here is that he had it before, it just makes it worse. <br />for the average healthy person, cannabis can do no harm from what i know. (i may be wrong, as i am strongly biased on this issue)

				I might be new here, but I&#039;ve been smoking for many years now, and I&#039;ve had it relatively easy.<br />Hell, the only time I&#039;ve experienced paranoia was in Amsterdam, after watching Hostel Part 3 a couple days beforehand. <br />I have friends who are paranoid schizophrenics but they had that problem before they started smoking - smoking just made it worse.

				I am all for facts and I am angry that people who are against drugs have used utter nonsense or blew tiny things up in a futile effort to keep people from using it. With as a result that it is difficult to trust any info. I have this info from reliable sources and also from personal experiences.<br />I know a couple of people who are addicted to it. Some people even say, I never knew that it could be addictive. <br />I have one loved one that weed triggered schizophrenia in (is addicted to weed). That person did have an other mental condition, but not schizophrenia.<br />An other person smoked weed once and it triggered psychosis out of nowhere. <br /><br />Here it is legal to smoke weed, so people can be more open about things. There are many addicts. I am happy for you guys that you don&#039;t have these problems yourself. But if you do talk about it and encourage people to smoke weed, please also inform them well.

				Cannabis can be a wonderful thing (it&#039;s a great aid to creativity) to the right people, if used with respect.<br /><br />For me (I have a terribly addictive personality) it was really starting to fuck my life up at a really important time, when I was in the later part of my education. I became really insecure and paranoid, but the worst part was I didn&#039;t believe it was my daily smoking of cannabis that was causing it. I just thought all my problems came from me and that lead to feelings of worthlessness and a year long period of depression.<br /><br />However, cannabis does seem to have a positive effect on many peoples&#039; lives.

				The Bible speaks of a special plant. &quot;I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.&quot; (Ezekiel 34:29) A healing plant. On either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare 12 manner of fruits, and yielding her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. (Revelations 22:1-2) A gift from God.<br /><br />Genesis 1:29 - And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed.<br /><br />The federal legalization, regulation, and taxation of cannabis combined with the federal legalization, taxation, and regulation of online gambling would generate massive revenue for the govt.&nbsp; <br /><br />In 10 years, our deficit wouldn&#039;t be so outrageous and we&#039;d gain our perfect credit rating back.&nbsp; If we could combine that with removing military bases in places like Okinawa, Japan and Germany in addition to Qatar, I believe Uncle Sam might leave with a little change in his pocket.&nbsp; Those bases are completely unnecessary and cost billions to maintain.&nbsp; Fucking ridiculous.
