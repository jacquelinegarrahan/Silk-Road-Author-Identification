				Sometimes I take eurotrips with my car and weed is much cheaper in some countries. What to you think, is it possible to score for bulk as a tourist. If I&#039;d get better price in countries like Spain or something I&#039;d definitely buy 0.5 - 1kg at once. I&#039;ve never asked for more than one night smoking from the street but I thought maybe I should give it a go next time when I&#039;m taking the trip. Is it a very bad idea or could I get it right? Maybe someone have experience with something similar?

				I live in a place where it would be very easy to score kilos of some seriously raw #4 heroin.&nbsp; Unfortunately I&#039;m more or less convinced that there would not be a safe way to cash out bitcoin here.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a tourist, it might be harder.&nbsp; I&#039;d say you&#039;d need at least a month to work your way up the chain of suppliers, but maybe weed wouldn&#039;t be that big of a deal.

				Spain? You have more luck in Holland to ask and actually complete a successful deal then in Spain. If you go ahead with this plan, without already knowing someone or more to it for that matter, first no one will take you seriously, those that probably would would take it very seriously into treating you like a cash machine. In other words...take what you what got, maybe spare you from a wound or two. <br /><br />Always remember, your a tourist, your outside your comfort zone, your prone to experience many negative things than locals living there, especially, robberies, pickpocketing, scammed. When you mentioned Spain, I seriously hope you were not thinking about Barcelona.<br /><br />Meerkovo

Generally people don&#039;t sell bulk to someone unless they know / trust them.<br />Usually have to build a relationship with the supplier before they just sell to you. How do they know you aren&#039;t a cop?
