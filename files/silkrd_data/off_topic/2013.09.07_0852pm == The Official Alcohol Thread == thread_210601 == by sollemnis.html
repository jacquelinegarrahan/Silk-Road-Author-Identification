				Ok, so there&#039;s an official Morning Coffee thread and an official Lady&#039;s of SR thread. So I thought, why not start an official alcohol thread???<br /><br />Alcohol isn&#039;t as good as most drugs IMO. BUT it goes well with some drugs, and most of all its legal and comes in many drinkable forms. It&#039;s a old ritual of mankind and it still has its place. I&#039;ll start off by saying my favourite drink is Leffe, it&#039;s a Belgium beer and it&#039;s gorgeous. As far as spirits are concerned (Liquor I believe it&#039;s called in the US, I don&#039;t know) then I&#039;m all for Jagermeister. Nice stuff... Drank icy cold of course and on its own.<br /><br />What are your favourite drinks? Does alcohol still have its place for you?

				When it comes to alcohol you can&#039;t really beat a Pina Colada on the beach with the sun setting IMO. Sounds pretty bent I know but get some fresh coconut milk with some equally as fresh pineapple juice and nice dash of quality white rum, blended together and served with crushed ice. Oh yes. <br />If I&#039;m out to get fucked, can&#039;t really beat a quality vodka such as smirnoff or grey goose. <br />A nice single malt whiskey on the rocks is nice with a few lines of cocaine.

				How much absinthe do you have to drink to get really fucked up? I bought a bottle (i think it was 400 mL worth) that claimed to contain wormwood, the psychoactive ingredient in absinthe. I split the bottle with my brother and although it tasted minty, I didn&#039;t get really drunk or tripping. I poured it over sugar cubes and everything. Should I drink an entire bottle of absinthe to myself if I want the full effect, or maybe the label on the bottle was lying to me?

				Moonshine or other illicitly produced booze tastes better, because the dollars that paid for it don&#039;t go to fund organizations such as the United States law enforcement. Starve that beast whenever the opportunity appears!
