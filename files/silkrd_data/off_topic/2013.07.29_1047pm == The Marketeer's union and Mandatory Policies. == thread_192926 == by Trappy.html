				We marketeers, or more slanderously, &quot;Salesmen,&quot;&nbsp; are generally the least ethical people in the real world, so I think its only fitting that we must exist as quite ethical on here. The fewer repercussions available to us, the fewer reasons we should ever attempt to pull something over on anyone. <br /><br />We must manufacture repercussions and a standard of quality, and that can be best accomplished by establishing a union with a public member list.<br /><br /><br />Now, these are the mandatory policies I enforce in regards to every vendor that employes me. Subsequent vendors to do the same will be held equally to these policies. I believe in order to establish a more perfect community, we must have transparency.<br /><br />More importantly, transparency insulates us from responsibility, and so, without further ado, here they are; vendors, listen up. <br /><br /><br />-Never ask for an early finalization. We abide exclusively by the resolution center and its resolutions and will never attempt to work outside of its boundaries.<br />-Fair shipping fees/never abusing shipping fees to inflate the price of a product, while displaying an unfair price of the product without shipping fees. This is a loophole which can be used to cheat the system, and we will explicitly avoid abusing this cheat. <br />-Never holding onto customer addresses.<br />-You must be prepared to teach PGP encryption to all new buyers. This is not our duty, but links can be provided. <br />-Each employee&#039;s total compensation is public knowledge, should a or many members of the public ask. Privately. Compare and contrast what the employer and the employee says. Please. This is your among your means of auditing us. <br />-Timely payment! We do not work for free.<br />-We are entitled to the remaining month&#039;s fee after termination, and in some cases (which may announced publicly), an additional month&#039;s fee.<br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br /><br />If interested in officially joining the marketeer&#039;s union, please apply. Understand that you exist under my limited dictatorship, despite voting privileges. They are only an illusion, I reserve the right to override any and every amendment to our policies, and to add to them at my own leisure. <br /><br />I do not reserve the right to cancel any of the current policies, which will be cemented after a period of time, so please hold me accountable should I do so.<br /><br /><br />If it is not against the rules, I may, after a period of time, demand membership dues and fees. Dues will likely be $25/month and apply to all members, myself excluded, along with a $25 up front fee to join, which will not be retro active should I choose to establish that as part of our fee structure.

				Our only goal is to advance and perpetuate our organization, which I believe will be best accomplished by performing at the top of our abilities, refining our abilities as to increase the cap of our abilities, and holding ourselves and our organization accountable to each other, our contractual employers, and the silk road public.<br /><br />Making vendors money just comes naturally. <br /><br /><br />Our current agenda is to increase the pool of money available to users like us. I believe underhanded and shady tactics will only decrease the pool of money available to us.<br /><br /><br />Here is the coffee room chat thread: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=192134.msg1387766#msg1387766<br />

				What exactly are you proposing?&nbsp; that all the vendors give you 25 dollars a month so they can say there part of a union?&nbsp; how does that help them? or the buyers?&nbsp; Its not like the vendors who are a part of this are going to have their operations verified to see if they are following the rules.&nbsp; &nbsp;So everyone is going to have to take their word that the rules are being obeyed which is pretty much how it is now.&nbsp; So why pay for that?

I think 6% is a fair commission, but it should subject to deviation. We may eventually come to add a set commission or compensation rate for all our marketeers, but we may not. <br /><br />The organization would hopefully provide adequate recompense for these fees, should they ever been enabled. I like collecting statistics, they help with marketing, and by the collectivism of our statistical information, we would all become more informed marketeers.

				So your collecting a group of buyers to act as advertisers for individual payment from vendors?&nbsp; And you want your cut?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t this system just lead to vendors with shity product paying for good reviews?&nbsp; Someone who had good product gets positive advertisement anyways.&nbsp;
