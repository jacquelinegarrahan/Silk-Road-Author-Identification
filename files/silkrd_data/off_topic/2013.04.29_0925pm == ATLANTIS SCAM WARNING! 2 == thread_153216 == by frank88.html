				They just made vendor announcements.<br />Sound much like ponzi scheme!!<br />What do you think?<br /><br />&quot;Good morning Atlantis vendors, we have please that you decided to use our services. As some of you will already know I offer customer support here on Atlantis (http://atlmlxbk2mbupwgr.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=4).<br /><br />We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few. The chance to invest in the site. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of the site. With Silk Road down for days we can take this opportunity to expand and overtake more of the market share.<br /><br />We are offering 250 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excluding running costs &amp; Admin share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$20&#039;000 per month or $240&#039;000 annually (estimated), with a lot of room for growth. Shares will be priced at $100 for a 0.1% share, paid in btc or ltc (see below) at BTC-E&#039;s weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.<br /><br />There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $50 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $250 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history.<br /><br />Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to be able to make the site run faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your buying/selling experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the account section of the account, where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types.<br /><br />Pay-outs will by default be monthly into your Atlantis account, the schedule can be changed and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.<br /><br />Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 250 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to made into it. &quot;

They sent everyone on the site a message warning people of the scam, and clearly stating that the only Atlantis username is &#039;support&#039; and this can be seen elsewhere on the site so it is clear. That was sent out weeks before this joker posted this.

				Yeah, I looked and they deleted that post from their forum so they are on the ball.<br /><br />Like AllDayLong says, on Atlantis, unlike SR, there is a big colorful label saying &quot;OFFICIAL ATLANTIS SUPPORT&quot; on the message, so you know it is really support and not someone making up an official sounding username. It was a feature requested by people over on the forums there, and they implemented it. It was a feature requested here too, but never implemented.
