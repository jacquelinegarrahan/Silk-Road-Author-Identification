				Not a goddamn thing, sadly. <br /><br />But yesterday, I found that a well-known graffiti artist (no, not that one) had tagged my area, and I had no idea he&#039;d been through here. That was pretty sweet. Or a copycat, I guess, but it made me smile all the same.<br /><br />Oh, and congrats on your first delivery! How does it feel?

				I made cash turn into money on SR with no issues. I&#039;ve never had issues but I don&#039;t do it all that often. Still, its just really nice when things work how they should IMO. Ugh. This was a nice thread to come across. +1 OP.

				Ranting about bullshit and meaningless arguments on here... that has helped a bunch. Other than that, I fucking worked all day with masonry. My back fucking HURTS!!!! Luckily, I have the offerings of gods, which were kindly received from the Road. So I won&#039;t be in pain much longer.<br /><br />Love you guys.&nbsp; ;D
