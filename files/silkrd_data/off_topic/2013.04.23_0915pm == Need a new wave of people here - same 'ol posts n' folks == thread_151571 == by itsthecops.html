				Can someone inspire some news articles ? <br />For those that don&#039;t know,&nbsp; &nbsp;After each news or magazine article on Silk Road , there is a wave of new people coming in. . . <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, everyone is cool, but it&#039;s the same old posts and opinions.&nbsp; We need some fresh viewpoints and opinions. <br /><br />Some hate the news coverage and want this a secret, but DPR himself promotes it and did a Forbes magazine article recently.&nbsp; Any news is good news for something like this.<br /><br />Of course, you can see the difference in people/personalities, depending on which magazine it was was and its readers.&nbsp; &nbsp;From neo-cyber punks, to dignified scholars.&nbsp; People use drugs/self medicate in every crowd.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t help but wonder what the next wave of people are going to be like?&nbsp; Young, old, medical patients, musicians/artists maybe ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it will be a supermarket tabloid magazine that will bring trailer park trash.&nbsp; Who knows, but one thing is sure is that there is no shortage of sellers to pick from.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe it will be meth, or research chemicals that will be the next big seller here.&nbsp; It really depends on the demographic of whatever&#039;s media is that covers the next silk road story. <br /><br />Spin doctors to the rescue:<br />Sellers and buyers alike could influence journalists With the promise of fresh leaked info about the site for a new story. Pick a media outlet that matches your goals and you may have some control over the kinds of people/customers that come.&nbsp; Headlines are the only way this site can market itself. <br /><br />At some point, a business needs fresh customers.&nbsp; Lets all hope for a fun crowd.&nbsp; <br /><br />
