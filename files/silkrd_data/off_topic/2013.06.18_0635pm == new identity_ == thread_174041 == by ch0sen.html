				Looking for info to obtain a new identity.&nbsp; I am not into identity theft and certainly would never do that to another person, but am looking for a way to &quot;become someone else.&quot;&nbsp; I have seen the listings for the fake ID&#039;s and SSN cards and all that.&nbsp; I am just not sure that is enough.&nbsp; What does it take to truly assume a complete new identity.&nbsp; Along with moving to a new town I have never been and completely dropping out of my<br />current life and into a new one.<br /><br />I will spare the long story and no, I am not in trouble with the law.&nbsp; Just the way my life has gone these past few years, and I keep waiting for things to change or get better somehow and it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; No matter how hard I try or what I do, the knife just gets pushed in further and harder.&nbsp; Honestly I am just sick of trying and trying and getting nowhere.&nbsp; So I am looking for options.&nbsp; Is it at all possible to just check out and into someone new?

				I recall seeing a listing on HackBB on the verified market. Verified by OptimusCrime, the administrator of hack bb. It was 6000 GBB if I&#039;m not wrong.<br /><br />Problem is, it did say it&#039;s for UK. You were getting a new british passport (government issued) as well as new, clear credit history. I did not purchase it myself but it seemed legit. <br /><br />See if it&#039;s still there.

				I figured you were referring to making a new Tor identity. <br /><br />As you were... ::)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
