				Go for a 2 mile run. Hit up the gym. Go to work a 12 hour shift on your feet without sitting for more than a minute or two throughout the day. Then come home have 2 glasses of wine or beer and then take a valium. You will sleep like a baby.<br /><br />If that fails get some heroin, lol.

				see, that&#039;s the thing. I go to the gym at least 3 times a week and attend college classes every day so my energy is pretty much tapped out at the end of the night but for some reason I cannot for the life of me get a nice night of sleep. I wake up at least once or twice at night and grumble back to sleep.<br /><br />my personal rules about drugs is 1. never do IV/IM, 2. never snort anything. so no to heroin. lol

				I was definitely joking about the heroin&nbsp; ;D You could try some seroquel if you can get it. Like 25mg to start. Its an anti psychotic, but its prescribed for insomnia at low doses. A person who uses it for its anti psychotic properties uses about 150 to 300mg and up to 600mg i believe. For insomnia its usually prescribed @ 25mg one hour before bed, or 50mg one hour before bed. Shit knocks you out and works in about 45 minutes.

				I know you were joking about the H, no offense taken. It&#039;s all cool.<br /><br />Seroquel you say? hmm. I&#039;ll keep an eye out for a vendor who sells that ware. I&#039;m currently trying to get in touch with a vendor for Ambien. Thanks for the advice. I&#039;d give you a +1 when I have a couple of more posts under my belt.

				No problem.<br /><br />Based on my experiences with insomnia its a lot harder to get prescribed ambien because of the abuse potential, but seroquel is very easy to get a script for. <br /><br />Of course you could always buy it here on SR, but it would be much cheaper to go see a dr if you have medical insurance. Good luck. I know how much it sucks to not be able to sleep.

				I DO have medical insurance and a doctor who&#039;s pretty much open-minded about me trying meds (so far only ADHD-related meds because of my medical record). But I want to try stuff out with experience before going to her &quot;hey, I&#039;ll like to try this and this to help with my sleep issues&quot;. Insomnia sucks balls. I like to imagine that it&#039;s a thing I can kick around as much I want to get my &quot;anger&quot; out. <br /><br />Vinny, thank you for your suggestions. I&#039;ll look into Etizolam. I think at this rate, an anti-psychotic for sleep sounds wonderful.

				Personally, ambien IR works the best for me.&nbsp; That said, you have to TRY to sleep after you take the pill. Literally, take the ambien, lay down and close your eyes, let the drug hypnotize you to sleep.&nbsp; If you pop the pill and sit on your computer, you may end up just surfing SR forums for hours(been there)...........<br /><br />Insurance should cover most of the cost of generic IR ambien, but afaik there is no generic timed-release ambien so that is expensive.&nbsp; Also, some doctors try to avoid prescribing ambien for long term use(although I was prescribed 10mg per night for years with no troubles)

				wow chunga or dmt on a daily basis?...dont listen to these guys... okay dude i had/have the same problem as you, horrible sleep even with going to the gym every second day, dont go down the drug path, your tolerance builds up massively.. for me to the point where i was crushing 6 stillnox and snorting that a night just to sleep. What you need to do is fix your circadian rhythm, by waking up to natural light at the same time every morning, dont watch any tv or computer 4 hours before you goto sleep cut down on sugar and no coffee after 5pm also doing progressive relaxation when your in bed..can suggest something if your interested, also reading a book that stimulates your brain in bed is also a no no...so main thing, minimize unnatural light 4 hours before sleep. oh eating carbs also stimulates your body to digest so also bad...eat some light cottage cheese if you must. If you need any other help ive got a good 2 more paragraphs of ramblings.

				STOP TAKING STUFF!!!<br />Then after cleaning your system out, start doing a bit of exercise, nothing like a fanatic, and try to sit quietly at times and breathe slowly and deeply. Don&#039;t think of it as meditation, although it is in a way. Try to empty your mind.<br /><br />Just calm yourself. Try later on to do a little introspection. Then when you lie down, keep doing the emptying of mind and the deep, slow breathing. I&#039;d be very surprised if you didn&#039;t regain your good sleep patterns after jsut a few weeks of this.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />MockFrog

				I struggled with sleep for a long time with no long-term improvement as a result of pharma or other substances. The solution I found took me a while to piece together, but it works and requires little effort. Bear with me, it may sound strange.<br /><br />It requires focusing on your breathing and visual space. Shortly after slowing your breathing and focusing your attention to the visual space (eyes closed), the usual blackness should begin to fade and phosphenes should follow shortly after. There are some decent videos (and alternative information) about phosphenes at the following clearnet site: <br />http://www.religiousvisionsoflight.com/<br />Once I was able to identify them I have had incredible success focusing on them and using them to sleep. The first I see resembles a large cloud that fades to a vanishing point in the distance. This repeats for a few runs until a similar cloud appears that fades away but then bulges back out for a moment. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been told by some in my life that this technique I stitched together resembles that of some light meditation. I&#039;m not one known to meditate, but it worked odd wonders for me.<br /><br />Even on days where I flip my schedule upside down and am trying to sleep when my body and mind are moving a mile a minute, I can fall asleep with this method. Granted, on those days/nights I may have to focus on my breathing and visual space for 20 or 40 minutes, but I&#039;ll take it over sleepless nights anyday/night.<br /><br />Hope you might achieve some relief through this.

				you probably need to reset your sleep patterns. or deal with some stressful issues before you can sleep easy....<br /><br />alternatively, just tell your doctor you&#039;ve had trouble sleeping, possibly why and be &quot;really concerned by it&quot;* and you should get something to help ko you.<br /><br />*: most doctors don&#039;t really want to prescribe anything potentially lending itself to abuse or listen to you moan and gripe, soo a little intensity and a cool story gets you the script-o<br /><br />good night ;)
