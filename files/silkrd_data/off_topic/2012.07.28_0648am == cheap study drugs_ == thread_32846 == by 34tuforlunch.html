				You can get regular amphetamine on this website for dirt cheap like 3.5 BTC. I highly suggest that and a scale to measure your doses. Since amphetamine doesn&#039;t have a time release the way adderal does I also suggest starting at a lower dose than normal.

				Well I hate to say this but MDPV is the cheapest but it can get out of hand quickly so I would suggest amphetamine (Speed) :).

				I sell a cognitive enhancing nutritional supplement called ThinkDeep that many people have reported to be effective as a study aid, especially when taken with a stimulant. I&#039;m currently out of stock but I&#039;ll have the next version out in about a week, check my seller profile. I&#039;d also recommend you try Piracetam, which is a russian smart drug that permanently improves your neurological and cognitive function with virtually no adverse effects.<br /><br />As for drugs, you could try low doses of methylone, it syngergizes very well with piracetam.

				In addition to what Tryptamine said, you could try aniracetam, which is stronger than piracetam.<br /><br />Also look into modafinil, which a guy called Coherence sells on here. It&#039;s not an amphetamine, but it&#039;s a wakefulness agent. It&#039;ll keep you awake for at least 12 hours. There may be some &#039;speedy&#039; feelings in the first couple of hours, but after that passes, you&#039;ll just feel fully alert and able to function at a high level.

				I&#039;d suggest methiopropanamine as an option. <br /><br />Effects are very similar to amphetamine, but! As a study drug it has advantage.<br /><br />Methiopropanamine effects wear off quite quickly, as result it is possible to eat and sleep. <br /><br />Such control with amph is wa-ay harder, speaking from experience.<br /><br />Such control does benefit study.

				Modafinil: cheaper but order with caution. For many people it really doesn&#039;t help focus or concentration. It does keep you awake though. Great to take if you have to take a test after an all nighter or something. Worth a try if you&#039;re interested but didn&#039;t do anything for me. To me, sleeping is worth more to my performance than getting a handful of extra studying hours in. Therefore, I usually am not without a decent nights rest and am not in need of a &quot;wakefullness promoting agent&quot; other than caffeine. <br /><br />Adderall: yes it is expensive on here, but just get it and don&#039;t waste it. Only take it a couple times a week max and only when you can clear the entire day to maximize your buck. <br /><br />Ritalin: expensive here in my book but as others suggested you could try international. I haven&#039;t seen any great prices recently though.<br /><br />Supplements: Tryptamine and others seem to know their shit so listen to them if you go down this avenue. I have used these at various times and haven&#039;t felt any great day to day benefits. My focus and concentration is most improved by diet and activity and sleep. When I need a boost I will turn to adderall. <br /><br />Street speed: never tried so I can&#039;t say either way, but to my limited knowledge the dextroamphetamine is the best studying aids. speed may not have this compound. <br /><br />Vivyanse: lasts longer than adderall and works just as great. Be forewarned, there isn&#039;t the same initial rush and high that adderall brings. still feels damn good though. <br /><br />

				For purposes of disclosure, I&#039;m one of the more popular adderall vendors here. This is my honest opinion and not some marketing tactic.<br /><br />I used to buy adderall for high prices too, and I&#039;ve always justified it by the value you get from them. Adderall is miles ahead of anything else as a study aid. If you value your education, or if you&#039;re paying 10-40K a year for college, is a few hundred dollars really &quot;too expensive?&quot;
