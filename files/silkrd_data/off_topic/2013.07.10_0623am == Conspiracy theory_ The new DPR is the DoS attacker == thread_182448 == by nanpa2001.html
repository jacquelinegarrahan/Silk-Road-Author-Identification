				I think it is obvious to everyone now that the DPR that has been posting recently is not the same DPR that created this website. He writes differently. He doesn&#039;t know certain things that the original DPR should know. So who is this guy?<br /><br />The change of control happened right after the DoS attacks on Silk Road. Is it so far fetched to think that DPR cut a deal with the attacker to end the attacks, and now the DoS attacker is the new DPR?<br /><br />Lets hear what the community has to say!

				Sad as it is...but I remind all posters that it will be for the benefit of us all if we don&#039;t publish our thoughts about any of DPR&#039;s details&nbsp; :( <br />DPR is what I call a hero/savior of what is left in terms of our mental liberty worldwide.<br />He enables us to aquire entheogens (and all the other drugs of what I call stuff from the candy store - tried once, moved on to the few thought enhancers nature/chemistry has given us - thx to A. Shulgin here too).<br />Please keep this in mind when posting.<br />It is for a reason governments outlaw anything that enables people to view things temporarily from different angles.<br />Entheogens revive a spirituality that govts try to stomp out.<br />Thank you DPR. <br />My deepest wish for you is that you find the necessary sleep that enables you to operate this service that helps seekers to lift the veil beyond this material world. <br />No more words needed. Those who understand - understand what I mean.

				These threads trying to find out who DPR is are interesting. I guess at least it lets you know who is LE on this site. Otherwise there is no reason to care. I mean seriously, this is anonymous and includes the admins. You don&#039;t need to know lol. I&#039;ve never assumed it was any actual person, but a completely fictional person that supposedly runs this site but it&#039;s really all the people running the site trying to maintain that one image. The more focus on a person that doesn&#039;t exist the better. Unfortunately it seems the cat is out of the bag because all the investigative journalism going on here lol. <br /><br />This guy just loves ddos attacks and hits torrent sites all the time and then starts trying to blackmail people to stop it. I would not be surprised one bit if it was him or someone in his group that was screwing with this site. <br /><br />https://twitter.com/ZeikoAnonymous

				Ok lets pretend that the DEA now owns SR. <br /><br />Since anyone worth anything pgp&#039;s from PM&#039;s to orders, nothing is gained. <br />Since anyone worth anything knows how to clean BTC from vendor accounts, nothing is gained. <br /><br />The only thing I could see is a loss of the forum which ive sat days at a time reading, you guys are a treasure trove of knowledge! <br />The other is vendors who are fresh out the box, every war has causalities but the tried and true ones will remain in one way or the other. <br /><br />The way I see it if we where able to figure out who DPR is then more or less this place is fucked! I do think we have more people to look into it all then LEO but LEO has more tools and money. <br /><br />Regardless you cant win the war on drugs, you can win a battle or two but we always come back bigger and better. As for TFM, you see anyone accepting paypal? =P<br /><br />&quot;Yo mate, i want a key of your meth but is it cool if i pay with my credit card n shiiit?&quot; LOL!!!

To play devil&#039;s advocate to that tho, they DEA could swap it out for future new customers, then let the first couple slide, build a case and then swoop in...but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very plausible. If this was going to happen, I think it would have happened...it seems that the consensus is their only hope is for us to slip up. But I don&#039;t follow it quite as close as some, so I could be WAY off.
