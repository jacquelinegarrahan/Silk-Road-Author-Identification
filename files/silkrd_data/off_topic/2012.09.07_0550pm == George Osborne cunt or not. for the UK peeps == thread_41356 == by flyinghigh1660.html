				Dunno why everyone is so anti him. We would all do the same if we could. We would all stockpile our wealth in offshore banks and watch the interest accumulate and want power if we could and do things others can&#039;t given half the chance. I know I would give my back teeth to be able to pull the shit most politicians can get away with and we have only scratched the surface on what they can and can&#039;t do. Fair play to the guy. <br /><br />Oh and Labour fucked our country, somebody had to deal with it. Shit happens, deal with it. Someone has to make the hard choices.

				Lim, you gotta be honest mate.&nbsp; Taking advantage of a position in power and doing things to better yourself, is one thing.<br />Ripping off honest tax payers who are struggling as it is, is quite another.<br />This time next year i dont know if im going to be in a job, and guess what, those POLITICIANS will make you take a fucking cleaning job for 4 pound an hour even if you have a mortgage to pay off.<br />And like i said about my step sister, who the fuck is going to look after her kid when shes FORCED to go to work?<br />Her son works, her daughter is at uni so basically now she is alone.<br />And guess where all those extra pennies are going, into George Osbornes fucking pocket.<br />Okay if he is not as bad as you say, then fair play.&nbsp; But for those who try to earn an honest living as most of us here do, we expect our taxes to be treated as such.<br /><br />Those are all just my opinions of course.&nbsp; Not trying to cause trouble or anything, just debating.

				I would also like to add, that the tory strategy is to get us all fighting each other, so that we turn a blind eye to what happens to the rich and opulent.

				They are trying to get everyone fighting each other so that we can say, &quot;oh that person doesnt deserve medical benefits he can work&quot;<br />The tories have lowered the tax for the rich, so that while we squabble away at the benefit issue we do not notice, well, the majority of us anyway.<br />Its a classic example of divide and rule.
