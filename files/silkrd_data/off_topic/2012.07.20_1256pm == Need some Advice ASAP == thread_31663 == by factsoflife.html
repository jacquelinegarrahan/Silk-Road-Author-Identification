				If the drug tests are a requirement of your bond I&#039;d assume there&#039;s no avoiding it, hell they&#039;d probably make you take a piss test even if you didn&#039;t have a urethra

				Drink lots of water to dilute any sample and eat something that makes your urine darker so they can&#039;t tell it&#039;s diluted.

				Drink loads of water and take vitamin B12.<br />The B12 will darken your urine.<br />They might ask you to come back in cos the sample is diluted but at least it&#039;ll buy you some time.<br />Don&#039;t take too much B12 or your piss will be bright orange and they&#039;ll cart you off to the ER&nbsp; 8)

				A guy once told me a cap full of bleach in a glass of milk cleans you out.<br />But then I never ever heard from that guy again so maybe you should try it on your dog first.<br />If shep keels over, for sure don&#039;t try it.

				If it is just a urine test, try to relax because it is possible to beat them.&nbsp; I have beaten 2 in the last couple of years with pre-employment screenings, where the sample was shipped off to a lab for analysis.&nbsp; What they will be checking for in the urine is the amounts of metabolites leftover from whatever substance they are looking for.&nbsp; With the tests I did I believe were screening for PCP, Cocaine, LSD, Ecstacy/MDMA and Marijuana.&nbsp; I have had friends who have used the flush kits you buy at the head shops and have passed, but basically my method is the same thing except cheaper.&nbsp; Dilution is the key, and then making it look like you have not diluted, because if the sample appears that is diluted you will fail and they will make you take it again.&nbsp; The way they check for urine dilution is color and creatine levels.&nbsp; So, a week before, if possible, buy some creatine supplement powder at GNC or any health store and start taking it according the instructions.&nbsp; This will boost your creatine levels to the point where they will appear normal in your diluted urine.&nbsp; During this week try to increase your fluid intake. A day before the test drink shit loads of water and cranberry juice.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if the cranberry juice is necessary, but this is what I did.&nbsp; The morning of the test, drink a couple large glasses of water, but don&#039;t go overboard.&nbsp; Take your daily dose of creatine.&nbsp; About 2 hours before the test you will want to take a vitamin B12 pill, this will color the diluted urine yellow.&nbsp; I was about a gram a day marijuana smoker for 15 years, and did cocaine and ecstacy 2 nights before my test.&nbsp; I weighed 185 pounds, and was of a medium build.&nbsp; &nbsp;I passed no problem, although I was shitting bricks the whole time waiting for the results.&nbsp; Another sure fire method according to friends is to substitute the urine with someone elses clean sample, or synthetic urine kept at body temperature and presented as your own.&nbsp; The urinator is a device used to conceal the urine and deliver it.&nbsp; I bought one from this site http://www.cleartest.com/products/the-urinator/&nbsp; after calling the # and speaking to someone in California who was very helpful and answered a lot of questions.&nbsp; I didnt use it however, and went with the method I described above.&nbsp; There are fake dicks, the whizzinator comes to mind, you can use as well if the doctor will be directly observing your junk while you piss.&nbsp; Anyway, I hope this has been some help and I wish you good luck with your test.
