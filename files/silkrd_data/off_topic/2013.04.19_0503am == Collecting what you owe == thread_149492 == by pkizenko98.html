				Hey<br /><br />So we have run into a little issue with someone not wanting to pay us for the service and goods we provide.&nbsp; This is off of SR.&nbsp; We have numerous ways of dealing with issues like this but thought it would make an interesting topic for the threads.<br /><br />We would like to hear some creative ways you have gotten dead beats to pay their debt, or whatever you can make up from the top of your head.&nbsp; Go!

				Can you give a rough estimate how much it is they owe ?<br />kind of important in deciding what can be done...<br /><br />if its not worth getting into trouble for.. start off with putting ads on craigslist offering sex and what not and go from there. You won&#039;t get the money, but still it will be amusing.

				yeah I was helping a coworker do the craiglist thing recently.. The person who owed him money (only $300) changed their mobile number 2 weeks after, so we are assuming it went well :p<br /><br />another idea... All though it will cost you... find the worst vendor you can from holland or another country like that and bulk order them something... be sure the vendor has the absolute worst stealth.. or basically writes &quot;DRUGS INSIDE&quot; <br /><br />*edit* whoops.. my ideas won&#039;t reallty help you collect..

				Both good ideas, that would freak him out in a serious way.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t wast the coins on his ass tho.&nbsp; I have something planned that&#039;s gonna make him wish he had just payed, cause he will be paying a higher price in the end, no physical harm tho!&nbsp;

				what they know about u and ur friends/family determines the worth of the act.<br /><br />emotion and pride.. never let it guide you. <br /><br />time is your friend and protector<br /><br />not having to leave a business card with your name on it at the scene is the best way.<br /><br />its business, not personal... is the best.<br /><br />but i dont advocate violence.. nobody pays for yesterdays drugs

				This was not me, but I heard of a story around where I am where this problem happened.&nbsp; The guy owed like $600 I think?&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t a lot but it wasn&#039;t small either.&nbsp; <br /><br />They broke into his house and like stole practically everything of value (way more than $600) and stored it in a safe place.&nbsp; Left a note saying something like, &quot;We repoed your shit for past due payments.&nbsp; Pay x to y or we will sell the items off to get our money back.&nbsp; We know how valuable your xbox game saves are to you so pay us back before they are gone forever.&nbsp; Thanks&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend this but it did work.&nbsp; Guy wasn&#039;t going to call the cops, cause of what it was over.&nbsp; Just makes me laugh so hard that they used his game saves as leverage to get back what was owed.

				bravo.. fkn least you dont go loopy. i used to go bananas over peanuts when i was a stoner. glad i didnt have the balls to do anything that would earn a jailtime.. i did get reprisal silent calls to my mothers house once though. that was an unintended consequence of doing revenge based on pride and emotion - the value $150. doing 20 to life for a bit of pride seemed like reasonable risk to take at the time.<br /><br />non-stoner now and not in the game. vastly saner.

				If you&#039;re on bad terms with them, there are plenty of &quot;destructive&quot; ways of doing this... not necessarily bodily harm, but ways which might make the chap stop dealing with your in the future even if he does settle the debt.<br /><br />If you want to keep relatively good relations with him (ie not sink to his level), try just raising the price for him. Make it completely clear to him that other people pay less because you can trust them, whereas he lost your trust so now he buys it back in extra charges.

If you fuck with someones vehicle you are a coward and a punk. Even with small amounts, IRL we at blueveil prefer the old take 3 guys with you and go collect method as it rarely results in further or even violent confrontations in the first place. If it&#039;s a small amount then they will pay up. If they buck up to 4 dudes coming to collect on a small payment then take it out of their ass and call it collected after you spit on them. Most idiots will gladly pay you something if you show up with big muscles behind you for backup.

				It all depends on the situation, I wouldn&#039;t call him a bitch.&nbsp; I personally think an exploded vehicle goes much further than a broken jaw.&nbsp; It has duel effect really, makes the individual consider the possibility that he could have been in said vehicle!

				okay if this person if dodging around and avoiding to pay your obviously going to have to do some work ( get your boys together and try an scare him ) or you can just get even. if he isnt paying you its a reason, you either fucked him or he is a bum. prolly the later.
