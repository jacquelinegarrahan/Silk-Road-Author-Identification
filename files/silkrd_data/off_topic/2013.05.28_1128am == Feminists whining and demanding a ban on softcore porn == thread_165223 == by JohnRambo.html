				Women feel threatened enough by female magazines like Playboy and Hustler to demand an end to the sale of those magazines, calling it harassment. But we all know that hardcore porn is so freely available, that women will never be able to stop it. This makes my point once again about women being threatened by new technology. Imagine how crazy women are going to get once virtual reality sex becomes mainstream? By that point, it will be far too late to stop it, and within another 20 or 30 years, then Female Sex Robots will be created. Once that happens, women will go batshit insane because they finally realize that men would rather fuck a superhot female robot or a superhot virtual reality woman than fuck a real life woman who is full of so many imperfections.<br /><br />http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sales-of-lads-mags-could-amount-to-sexual-harassment-lawyers-tell-shops-8632909.html<br /><br />Anyway what a joke this is. Softcore magazines with nude photos of women have been around for decades, and only now women are objecting? By the time virtual reality porn becomes mainstream, women won&#039;t even recognize the threat and it will be too late then.<br /><br />The future is that real human women are going to be made obsolete by advanced technology like Female Sex Robots. Once that happens, I believe that the present population level of women will be reduced to 10 percent of it&#039;s present population. Real human women will no longer be required for anything other than procreation, and once artificial wombs replace that, then real human women may very well go extinct.<br /><br />This is how selfish western women are. Rather than talk about REAL ISSUES concerning women&#039;s rights like women getting stoned to death in Pakistan, they&#039;d rather focus on something extremely insignificant like Penthouse or Playboy magazines.<br /><br />Uh ladies? No one is going to take you seriously. How about you start talking about REAL humans rights issues like women getting stoned to death in Pakistan, rather than waste time talking about some softcore girlie magazines.<br /><br />You ladies are disgusting in your hypocrisy and selfishness. You could care less about women getting stoned to death in Pakistan, because those women aren&#039;t white women. Feminism is a white female supremacist movement. White women only care about white women. White women could care less about brown or black women.<br /><br />White women are the most materialistic, evil, selfish bitches on earth.

				These feminists need to get off face book and help their oppressed sisters around the globe. Complaining about nude girls while no mention of gender segregation or clitoridectomy etc. their are so many causes desperate for a voice but choose the easiest softest target they can... <br /><br />&quot;I chose to look at a magazine i havent paid for and the woman I saw made me feel like the fat ugly cow I am, time for me to blame the world&quot;

				I&#039;m not sure where I read it. It might of been here or some other dim lit corner of the darknet. <br /><br />It was some anonymous confessions of a serial rapist. <br /><br />What I found so intriguingly sick, yet captivating and enthralling was that he had done a self analysis upon his actions and seemed fairly competent in doing such. Besides the whole concept of rape and the abuse of another human being, his general thought process, while extremely sick, didn&#039;t seem very far off kilter. <br /><br />I just spent the last 10 minutes typing up a long synopsis of what I remember reading, but it kind of made me disturbed and slightly afraid I may end up agreeing with some of the points. In order to cease that mentality or at least curtail its inevitable fruition, I&#039;ve decided to delete it all. <br /><br />I could just delete this whole shit post, but then how will I ever become a Hero Member.<br /><br />On the other note, does anyone else find themselves glued to reading that kind of shit? Not in a way where you discover a new spectrum of thinking, but as a nose dive into another human beings psyche. For me, the more disturbing and &quot;holy shit&quot; the better. Curiosity... or solace&nbsp; :-\ <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Bottom line is all these girls chose to either do porn or photoshoots or whatever. <br /><br />These aren&#039;t some tweaked out hookers being pushed around and forced to have sex for cash.<br /><br />

				...I really think this is a loud minority, as with most things. None of the girls I know have anything worse to say about lad&#039;s mags than that they&#039;re stupid, which they are but then so are women&#039;s mags so whatever.<br />Actual feminism? It&#039;s about a women&#039;s right to choose, whether that&#039;s to stay at home and knit or spreadeagle herself in the centre of FHM...if you feel that offended by a naked chick, even if her tits ARE nicer than yours (and often they are, deal with it) then you have bigger issues methinks.
