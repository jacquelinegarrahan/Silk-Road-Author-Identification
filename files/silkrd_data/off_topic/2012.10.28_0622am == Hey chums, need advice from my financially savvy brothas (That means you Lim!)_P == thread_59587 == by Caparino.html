				A middle eastern country I&#039;ve invested in has their market going to shit because of recent occurences; I&#039;d go there myself and do this but I&#039;m scared for my life. I&#039;m still in the positive from when I started the investment but it won&#039;t stay that way for long. What&#039;s the cheapest way to transfer my money from that currency to dollars and safely into my bank account here. I know of moneygram and services but they have high fees; anything over a couple percent means I&#039;ll be losing thousands<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I have a relative stationed there that can orchestrate this plan for me but they might get shot or robbed if they leave the bank, so I&#039;m a bit scared that might happen<br /><br />P.S.S. I missed you fuckers, how&#039;ve you been?

				Hmmm you could transfer the cash into a trust in another jurisdiction to be accessed at a later date? Would cost a bit but it&#039;s probably the fastest way. Unless it&#039;s locked in the account then you&#039;d have to jump through hoops.

				Iv used HiFX in the past. There exchange rates are pretty reasonable and there arent that many fees to think of. Your might have to wait until tomorrow but it would be worth giving them a call and see what they have to say.
