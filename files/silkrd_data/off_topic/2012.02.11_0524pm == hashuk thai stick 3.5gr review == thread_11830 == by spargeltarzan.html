				Hi,<br /><br />I´ve been smoking mostly synthetic weed these last 2 years since I rarely got my hands on the real stuff. Then I read an article about Silk Road and began googling. My first order was from hashuk and a 3,5gr ThaiStick at a reasonable price. <br />It took about a week to reach me and was double sealed in a simple envelope. Nothing out of the ordinary in my daily mail. Perfect.<br /><br />The weed was nothing special. Smell and taste were okay, it was still a bit too wet for my taste - one day later it was perfect. Can´t say if it was overweight or not. I was happy with the amount I got!<br />There were still some red pieces of string in there, but somehow it felt just like ordinary weed (maybe not fully fermented since it smelled still a bit &quot;green&quot;).<br /><br />As far as potency goes it was quite weak. Compared to Blabla, Monkees or MNK (all synthetic) this weed was way weaker! But it was perfect for use while doing something, not the right choice if you want to get stoned. I wanted to get stoned, so I was a bit disappointed. <br /><br />Other than that I can recommend the seller and given the price tag I won´t complain. This time (just waiting for my btcs to register) I will order something different.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />spargeltarzan<br /><br />PS: The seller is still listed on SR, but seems to have no items on sale atm. So I don´t know if this will be helpful. ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
