				Hi Macmeth<br /><br />Dunno how successful you&#039;ll be contacting underground activists on SR given pretty much everyone here wants to remain anonymous - discussion and debate, yes; face-to-face meetings IRL, very very unlikely.&nbsp; Risk of entrapment and all that.&nbsp; However, Znet (on clearnet) has an activist community forum called IOPS, and there are decentralised, autonomous groups worldwide organizing direct action around specific issues, who I&#039;m sure would be only too happy to have you in their numbers.&nbsp; There is a wide cross section of communities represented as far as I can see.&nbsp; From these fora you should be able to determine who is prepared to do what, and affiliate yourself with them, test the waters to see how radical their ideas and proposed actions are in comparison to yours - find the common ground and proceed together.<br /><br />The Anonymous hacktivist group post on the 4chan imageboard (http://www.4chan.org/) would be a good place to start - they instigated the Pedobear and DDos attacks on CP sites, have successfully DDos&#039;d MPAA, RIAA and anti-piracy sites.<br /><br />9gag is another hacktivist group where you could pick up pointers on how to instigate DDos attacks (http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/9gag), particularly as they have an ongoing feud with 4chan, and appear to regularly target one another.<br /><br />Both groups have successfully navigated and recovered from DDos attacks on their own sites so would be a good place to start.&nbsp; Good luck and take extreme care - because of heavy domestic corporate and transnational corporate pressure, not to mention governmental crackdowns, if you are identified you will face a jail sentence.&nbsp; Use encrypted zombie bot networks - I only know the terminology and general principles behind DDos, not the practicalities, but I&#039;m sure these guys can get you started.&nbsp; Looks like Ubuntu/Linux is the best OS to initiate DDos.

				I didn&#039;t read your whole post OP, but if 9 out of 10 people are 100% against something, no matter what it is, if it moves forward, take your country back by FORCE. if your 90% can&#039;t throw out the 10% then you aren&#039;t doing something right.
