				Last week I tried DMT for the first time, and did a nice bit with me Ubie. About 150mg to the face, mostly in two hits that were HUGE.<br /><br />I coughed them up like I was smoking a big ass cone of chronic.<br /><br />Upon take - off, I was ego-less. Upon breakthrough to DMT hyperspace, the room lifted up and away with the walls. The power of this drug is unreal.<br /><br />The windows became liquid streaks of light and the dog was a flat, breathing white mass on the floor. His existence made no sense to me. I dared not<br /><br />look at his face, as he was way too complex for the state I was in. Instead I turned around and looked into the room I was in, and it hit full force.<br /><br />I grinned so deeply it felt like my body was smiling. The patterns are so incredibly powerful and pervasive, as well as color and light. Whole surfaces<br /><br />appear to move very far from where they were.<br /><br />Could not move due to the onslaught of the high I was experiencing. I saw beings as people say - but they were friendly. I conversed with them,<br /><br />but about what I don&#039;t remember....Deep understanding of civilization, why we&#039;re here, and ancient beginnings of life. DMT is that deep, deep shit.<br /><br /><br />**SO, moving forward - hours after this experience I had a fucking crazy vision. Going to share it below.**<br /><br /><br />What if we pioneered a way to move things across TCP/IP - and wrap packets while we do it for encryption? Sounds like some out-of-movies shit.<br /><br />Imagine the possibilities !? Obviously it would be exploited so firewalling with dmz would be necessary....the repercussions wouldn&#039;t be a fucked up OS -<br /><br />rather an ass kicking by someone hired to do so, teleported over TCP/IP. Or perhaps if it&#039;s fast enough, fire a bullet into the receiving end! LOL<br /><br />Would we need a sort of &quot;pod?&quot; I don&#039;t know I&#039;m not there yet. I think we could stand under a light source that would act like a giant scanner.<br /><br />We already harness the technology to optically recognize and process, why can&#039;t we take that further and duplicate / transport ?<br /><br />You would be scanned, encryption validated, and whatever you have on you would go with you. You could scan an object and have it show up across <br /><br />the world in GT/sec. This could prove to be incredibly groundbreaking, yet incredibly dangerous. It would require particle physicists, nuclear physicists,<br /><br />and extremely smart people way above myself. They&#039;d be using matter theory applied to TCP/IP protocol, which I&#039;m not sure would get along too well.<br /><br />Silk Road would become so fucking active their servers would explode with the amount of orders placed.

I think I&#039;m going to order more DMT now.<br /><br /><br />Meanwhile my digi-heads and silk-knurds get at this and give me your input. Is it really unfeasible?

				all that we really need to be able to teleport things like you&#039;re talking about is a three dimensional matter printer and a higher resolution MRI-type device.&nbsp; 3D printers already exist and are used to print skin cells and DNA, but these are still in their infancy.&nbsp; We are at least 50+ years from being able to create complex living organisms from scratch.

				You have inspired me my good friend. I have a good deal on DMT on hand and i have smoked it about 3 times now (even using your ubie) but never got very high because i was always very careful with the dosage etc. because i had heard that DMT really fucks you up.

Don&#039;t be afraid. If this is your first time with a psychedelic, don&#039;t do it if you&#039;re feeling afraid. Take some shrooms and graduate up to a few trips on LSD...otherwise this shit will take you by storm.<br /><br />Although it is a pleasant storm that will leave you so amazed, you will question why we have it in our bodies, and you will question life and the meaning of existence - We all must try it to see beyond what we are <br /><br />trying to see. Compared to very clean LSD, DMT is similar but more potent and more of a visual onslaught. It also doesn&#039;t last many hours. It also is pure DMT via an extraction, and not put on a blotter. It&#039;s just there.<br /><br />Another more noticeable difference is the dissociation and out of body feeling - seeing external beings and communicating with them. You can be tripping your sack off on LSD and this type of breakthrough cannot <br /><br />happen. It is just the chemical nature of DMT. The short trip experienced on DMT when you break through - is 10x more powerful than any LSD you&#039;ve eaten, or mescaline microdots you&#039;ve thrown down the hatch. <br /><br />Esp. if the DMT is clean. 15 minutes later your operation is a success! Burn up a fat cone and take notes on what you just experienced. Draw it. Paint it. After at least ten years in my teen/college days of tripping on<br /><br />LSD, mescaline, and shrooms 3x a week, I haven&#039;t touched either since. I think I&#039;ve done my share of them. DMT is my choice now. I will keep a stash like I keep weed. Mental turmoil and cant figure it out? DMT. <br /><br />Spiritual issue that ganja alone cannot solve? DMT. Comfortably timed super-trip of your life in two tokes? DMT!<br />PS.<br /><br />Nomad, YOU PAINT?@!?#?<br /><br />PM me pls.....i&#039;m an oil painter and teach drawing @ night.<br /><br />ï£¿L75

				Very nice, lasagna. I love hearing transformative tryptamine stories. I love LSD and Mesc, but DMT takes you to the core of it all - there is no playing around. I&#039;d recommend you try the oral route with harmala alkaloids next. The DMT flash is mind-boggingly powerful, but over time you may find it too short-lived. An oral experience will allow you to communicate with those beings for a longer period of time&nbsp; :).

				Have any of you guys heard about &quot;SHE&#039;s&quot;? Synchronized Hyperspace Events. People plan a specific date and time to smoke DMT around the world, and they actually HANG OUT WITH EACH OTHER in hyperspace! What the christ! Check out the dmt-nexus forums, it&#039;s all over the place. Really makes you second guess what you think you know about reality. DMT isn&#039;t naturally occurring in numerous organisms for no reason.
