De Leon placed in leg restraints and a bite mask.<br /><br />De Leon, who was reportedly in possession of rum and Four Loko when arrested, was discovered to be under the influence of a type of bath salts called &quot;Cloud 9.&quot; His blood test also revealed levels of cannabis, alcohol, and Xanax.<br /><br />At the bond hearing, De Leon told the judge, &quot;I have no recollection of anything that happened that night.&quot;<br /><br />His bond was set at $7,500 on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest with violence.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok, first it was &#039;LSD like substance&#039; in the first zombie attack, now it&#039;s &#039;synthetic marijuana&#039;? What the fuck kind of weed are these journalists smoking that&#039;s white powder? They even say it was Cloud 9, so why even put marijuana in the article other than to blemish yet another harmless drug?

				It&#039;s an LSD-like-synthetic-marijuana-bath-salt-powder. I did a quick google but everyone seems to be wayy off base with it, one site says it&#039;s synthetic marijuana, another synthetic coke, another synthetic meth and yet another synthetic ecstacy - they&#039;re all over the place on deciding what it is, if some guy masturbates to it some journalist will label it a synthetic vagina.<br /><br />Logic would say it&#039;s some form of MDPV than any of the above, apparently they&#039;re selling it at gas stations, I&#039;ve been paying at the pump and probably haven&#039;t stepped foot in a gas station in a year, guess I&#039;ve been missing out.

				Yeah, when I first read that story about the guy who ate off parts of a homeless guy&#039;s face, the story said the attacker was under the influence of a &quot;a new kind of LSD.&quot;&nbsp; Later in the same article bath salts were to blame.&nbsp; Shit, this was The New York Times, a fairly reliable source of news. Journalists ought to know the difference between bath salts and psychadelics.

				Aren&#039;t most of these bath salts just MDPV?<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;d just stay the fuck away from all bath salts and these new synthentic analogues lest I want to start eating someone&#039;s face off.

				Journalists apparently don&#039;t do drugs or know shit about them. I noticed the huge discrepancy too claiming &quot;bath salts&quot; and new &quot;synthetic LSD&quot; in major reputable newspapers. It&#039;s a disgrace.

This stuff is Cloud 9 bath salt and it&#039;s a white powder that people are sniffing and injecting, not a synthetic cannabis at all, it&#039;s some form of MDPV.

				Gaaaawwwwd they pull their fucking journo fingers out their fucking journo arses and actually report this shit in a scientific way. Jesus Christ where to begin with this shit. <br /><br />1.

The idea of LSD+ which these papers (heard this story before in another thread) seem to dream up cannot and will not ever be able to exist. Just fairy stories. <br /><br />These bath-salts are basically ass-bandits thinking they are being well clever by chopping loads of different cathinones together not realising that MDPV sends you completely mental in large doses (I personally hate the shit, dirty dirty drug) and putting it in snazzy packaging and then dick&#039;ed kids are doing massive lines of it and getting so paranoid because they are ODing that they are going Cadbury&#039;s fruit and NUT.

				The reason I called it a form of MDPV is from this I found, which seems a good source on the information:<br /><br />Forms of MDPV<br />MDPV is most frequently found as a water-soluble salt. It can be converted to the free base by basification with sodium bicarbonate or 10% ammonia. Because of its semi-liquid physical properties, the free base is difficult to handle and measure.<br /><br />I was trying to find how they confused it with a synthetic cannabis, but from what I found the synthetic cannabis marketed as &#039;Cloud 9&#039; is completely unaffiliated with the &#039;Cloud 9 Bath Salt&#039;.

				That&#039;s the really ridiculous thing about these bath salts things. You CAN&#039;T dose properly on that shit because it&#039;s such a chopped up mish-mash of shit that you don&#039;t even know what you are taking and what amounts of what are in it. For example with MDPV some people take as low as little as 10-20mg because it&#039;s THAT strong. Clearly these people are gunna be doing standard 50-100mg lines so that&#039;s 5-10 x the standard dose of that whatever amounts you do as a base dose. That&#039;s the problem though MDPV is just gunna be 1 of the things in it. <br /><br />If it is MDPV in it then that&#039;s MFUBAR because that shit is illegal preeetty much world-wide now anyway so anyone selling that shit means you are just counting down the hours until you get nicked by the cozzers. The whole thing is just one massive fuck up after another after another after another with a great big chocolatey fuck up with extra fucked cream and fucked marshmallows on top. These people are basically writing the book on how to deal drugs and NOT get away with it. <br /><br />Chapter 1. Buy some legal drugs that aren&#039;t legal anymore.<br /><br />Chapter 2. Mix up these illegal legal drugs in such a way that they will hospitalize and kill people.<br /><br />Chapter 3. Sell this shit to people in Petrol Stations and Headshops in shiney attention-getting packages. <br /><br />Chapter 4. Wait for people to drop dead.<br /><br />Chapter 5. Go to prison.<br /><br />Chapter 6. Cry yourself to sleep while you play with the serial killer you share a cell with&#039;s dick and wonder what the fuck happened and where the fuck you went wrong.<br /><br />The end<br /><br />Not sure what the LD50 is on MDPV but I can imagine it&#039;s not that much. You can probs find it on Wiki maybe?

				Isn&#039;t prohibition wonderful...<br /><br />Seriously, the only reason people do these random fucked up drugs that do god knows what is because they don&#039;t want to do, or can&#039;t get, illegal drugs.<br />It&#039;s the kids I feel bad for. They get told that weed will melt your brain, and so they do these &quot;legal highs&quot; because they must be safe if they&#039;re legal right? Shit&#039;s fucked up.
