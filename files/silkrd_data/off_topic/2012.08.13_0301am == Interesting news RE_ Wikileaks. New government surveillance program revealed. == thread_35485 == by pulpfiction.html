				Found this interesting. Thought some here may as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />From : http://io9.com/5933966/wikileaks-reveals-trapwire-a-government-spy-network-that-uses-ordinary-surveillance-cameras<br /><br />Wikileaks reveals “TrapWire,” a government spy network that uses ordinary surveillance cameras<br />&nbsp;Annalee Newitz<br />It&#039;s just like an episode of Person of Interest. According to documents leaked on Wikileaks, the government has created a piece of technology, called TrapWire, that siphons data from surveillance cameras in stores, casinos, and other businesses around the country. Apparently agents can use facial recognition software to analyze this footage for, well, people of interest. Are we living in a total surveillance state without even realizing it?<br /><br />Over at Business Insider, David Seaman reports on the contents of the documents at Wikileaks:<br /><br />Every few seconds, data picked up at surveillance points in major cities and landmarks across the United States are recorded digitally on the spot, then encrypted and instantaneously delivered to a fortified central database center at an undisclosed location to be aggregated with other intelligence. It&#039;s part of a program called TrapWire and it&#039;s the brainchild of the Abraxas, a Northern Virginia company staffed with elite from America&#039;s intelligence community.<br /><br />The employee roster at Arbaxas reads like a who&#039;s who of agents once with the Pentagon, CIA and other government entities according to their public LinkedIn profiles, and the corporation&#039;s ties are assumed to go deeper than even documented. The details on Abraxas and, to an even greater extent TrapWire, are scarce, however, and not without reason. For a program touted as a tool to thwart terrorism and monitor activity meant to be under wraps, its understandable that Abraxas would want the program&#039;s public presence to be relatively limited. But thanks to last year&#039;s hack of the Strategic Forecasting intelligence agency, or Stratfor, all of that is quickly changing.&quot;<br /><br />So: those spooky new &quot;circular&quot; dark globe cameras installed in your neighborhood park, town, or city-they aren&#039;t just passively monitoring. They&#039;re plugged into Trapwire and they are potentially monitoring every single person via facial recognition.<br /><br />Currently it&#039;s pretty hard to reach Wikileaks to read the papers yourself, because the site has been crushed under an onslaught of DDOS attacks — which, how convenient is that, conspiracy theorists? But you can still see a description of Abraxas&#039; Tripwire technology here, at the USPTO.<br />

				I&#039;m more scared of what the Japanese have! <br /><br />http://www.webpronews.com/new-japanese-facial-recognition-software-is-powerful-scary-2012-03<br /><br />Big brother alert!!! For those of you who don’t like the idea of CCTV monitoring your every move, the details a recent software breakthrough by Hitachi Kokusai Electric will probably make you soil your undergarments, or at least never leave the house without a mask. How does the idea of facial recognition software that can scan 36 million faces in one second sound? How about not only can the software scan that many different faces in such little time, but being able to actively index them as well?<br /><br />Scared yet?<br /><br />As pointed out by GeekOSystem.com, the applications for such software are naturally aimed at surveillance programs, ones that monitor a large number of people at a given time. Think sporting events, shopping malls, and public transportation hubs. Leading the article is a video that details the software, and shows the various applications its capable of. Let’s just say recognizing and storing these faces is only the beginning.<br /><br />Scanned faces can then be searched for in other footage, allowing the watchers to monitor the selected person’s activity, provided there’s additional footage of them available. GeekOSystem’s take on the application of such software is even more revealing:<br /><br />Once you have a face identified with the system, you can click the thumbnail and receive a wealth of search results, including every other clip the identified individual is in. This allows you to pick out someone sketchy in one scene and immediately see where they were before and after, plus it also allows you to upload a suitable photo and then use the system to see if the person is, or isn’t, in the area. That is, so long as they’ve glanced towards a camera.<br /><br />This sounds like something the British Government would wholly embrace.

				apparently Wikileaks is currently under mass DDoS after having released this information. This is reminding me of winter 2010 all over again.

				Or you could go the http://cryptome.org/ and get the information and other great resources from John and his great site.<br /><br />Remember to buy your Cryptome Archive DVDs whilst you are at it.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />
