				I&#039;m curious to know what drugs have other users done for the greatest duration of time?<br />Is there any drug you can see yourself using daily, or for life?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Not counting weed ive rolled for every day in a week and tripped on acid every day in a week and did 2ci 4 days in a row. Rolling and 2ci fucked me up really bad and i couldnt operate in society properly. however acid worked wonders and didnt feel like it fucked my shit up other than a lot of blank stares when i was thinking about other things. couldnt imagine anything every day forever

				Its cool to do all the time. Food for thought: weed after a tolerance break is very psychoactive, and I believe it is the same way with LSD. It gives different effects if done every day, more relaxing and enjoyable rather than mindfuckingly intense!!

I&#039;m going to see Furthur in a couple weeks and I think that&#039;ll be my last trip for a little while. <br /><br />That&#039;s so weird. The exact same thing happened to me the first time I dropped acid. I was a daily smoker before that, and then pretty much out of nowhere I stopped smoking bud. I&#039;ve only done it a couple times since, mainly out of curiosity, and I&#039;m really not a huge fan anymore. //weird.

				I&#039;ve done MXE daily for weeks straight with no side-effects to speak of so far other than having a spiffy tan. ;D It&#039;s saved me a couple of hundred dollars on weed because they have such amazing synergy. I try my best to involve DMT with my morning meditation but sometimes I just forget to, it&#039;s a pretty amazing drug like that. I can smoke it several times daily in a week and then just forget to smoke it one morning and not even notice it, even weed makes me a bit cranky when I stop smoking it. :D
