				So are you saying you were not aware that the CIA is one of the biggest drug smuggling operations?<br /><br />Next thing you know you will say that you are not aware that the CIA put Osama Bin Laden, Castro, and Saddam Husein in charge of their respective countries. Not to count that they are responsible for the current state of the Iranian government.

				Read this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">During the Taliban rule, Afghanistan saw a bumper opium crop of 4,500 metric tons in 1999,.[15] However, in July 2000, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, collaborating with the United Nations to eradicate heroin production in Afghanistan, declared that growing poppies was un-Islamic, resulting in one of the world&#039;s most successful anti-drug campaigns. As a result of this ban, opium poppy cultivation was reduced by 91% from the previous year&#039;s estimate of 82,172 hectares. The ban was so effective that Helmand Province, which had accounted for more than half of this area, recorded no poppy cultivation during the 2001 season.[16][17] The Bush administration paid a 43 million dollar &#039;eradication&#039; reward payment to the Taliban in 2001.<br /><br />[15]&nbsp; http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2004/McCleanBriefing_041118.doc.htm<br />[16]&nbsp; http://www.unodc.org/afg/reports_surveys.html<br />[17]&nbsp; http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/20/world/taliban-s-ban-on-poppy-a-success-us-aides-say.html<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Look at this: <br /><br />https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Afghanistan_opium_poppy_cultivation_1994-2007b.PNG<br /><br />Call me a conspiracy theorist and you can go fuck yourself. This is a real conspiracy. The facts are on my side.<br /><br />You might be thinking, ah of course Pine, it&#039;s all about $$$ and control of supply of h/opium, it&#039;s obvious, but this is also not what is really going on I&#039;m afraid, it&#039;s just one part of the picture, I think it&#039;s actually much worse than that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The International Narcotics Control Board states that an over production in licit opiates since 2000 has led to stockpiles in producing countries &#039;that could cover demand for two years&#039;. Thus, some say Afghan opium would contribute to an already oversupplied market and would potentially cause the supply and demand imbalance that the UN control system was designed. However, the World Health Organisation points out that there is an acute global shortage of poppy-based medicines such as morphine and codeine. This is largely due to chronic underprescription (especially in countries where morphine is extremely highly priced). The International Narcotics Control Board which regulates opium supply throughout the world enforces the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs: this law provides that countries can only demand the raw poppy materials corresponding to the use of opium-based medicines over the last two years and thus limits countries who have low levels of prescription in terms of the amounts they can demand. As such, 77% of the world&#039;s opium supplies are being used by only six countries, leaving the rest of the world lacking in essential medicines such as morphine and codeine (See Fischer, B J. Rehm, and T Culbert, &quot;Opium based medicines: a mapping of global supply, demand and needs&quot; in Spivack D. (ed.) Feasibility Study on Opium Licensing in Afghanistan, Kabul, 2005. p. 85–86.[32] ). A second-tier supply system, that complements the current UN control system by supplying opium-based medicines to countries currently not receiving the poppy-based pain relief medicines needed, would maintain the balance established by the UN system and provide a market to Afghan-made poppy-based medicines.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Basically the United States wants monopoly or effective monopoly control of the supply of *morphine* if possible.<br /><br />Why though? Seems a bit abstract, right? That is a question that has a much darker answer than you might anticipate. They are deliberately constricting supply and storing it up as a tactical advantage in a future war, I don&#039;t mean a shitty little war like Afghanistan or Iraq, I mean a proper out all world war between Powers where there would be a real existential threat to the State itself.<br /><br />My hypothesis is that control of morphine is a much more critical component of a army&#039;s supplies than you might imagine at first and that most important of all: morphine cannot be easily replaced synthetically. To put it another way, there isn&#039;t really an alternative. Morphine is an extraordinarily effective drug, all the best painkillers are derivatives of it. I don&#039;t believe there is an alternative synthetic to morphine.<br /><br />My hypothesis is open to falsification, if you can find me a drug that is as effective as morphine with with the same property of potentially abundant and relatively inexpensive supply, then my hypothesis is debunked. Doesn&#039;t stop that graph implying an extraordinarily level of deceit to the American people though, that would still need to be explained in some way.

				Pine why the fuck do you care so much lol? Anyone with 2 brain cells can figure that the world is bent, you just have to manipulate the system to fit your needs because really, you have to accept that nothing really changes. People always want power and those with power are going to want to retain it and thus do things to ensure they do so. If you look at the British Empire we were running the world for years doing shady shit, I mean we went to war with China to essentially create junkies. The difference is is that you guys have only been running the world since 1945 so you get all excited when you find out things are not always how they seem. <br /><br />In reality this perfect world that, in my eyes anyway, the people who, again in my eyes, are more idealistic on this forum are looking for will never exist. The world works on behind-the-scenes agreements, shady deals, and working by doing each other favours and scratching peoples backs when they scratch yours.

				^^ Also, you may be wondering why the poppy isn&#039;t grown everywhere. It is probably because it&#039;s extremely hard to do this efficiently. I don&#039;t know much about agronomy of the poppy, but since h and opium and morphine are so compelling and useful, it seems fairly obvious that if it were possible, then it would be everywhere. But it is not. Not for legal reasons for sure, I mean it&#039;s not like that stops hydroponic weed farms and I would reckon on h consumers being fairly well motivated, but for practical ones related to botany I&#039;ll bet my bottom dollar. Some plants species, even subspecies can only be grown in extremely specific conditions, and I think this is likely the case here.<br /><br />As a result, the farming of the poppy and production of its derivatives is *extremely* geographically concentrated. Today I think there are effectively only 3 or 4 places in the world it is even possible to grow the poppy, there&#039;s a place in India, a place in Mexico, and of course Afghanistan. Afghanistan accounts for something like 75% - 90% of the worlds supply, so that gives you a good indication of how concentrated this business must be.<br /><br />I mean, if the 3rd world has massive demand for morphine, then it doesn&#039;t look too sophisticated to grow the poppy grow in Afghanistan to me, so they would be doing it themselves, but they are not.

				Lol I wasn&#039;t trying to say I was more sophisticated than you or visa-verse nor was I saying you are naive. However I am not fatalistic, I just accept the world for what is and that you have to manipulate it to get what you want. You can buy everyone for a price and I&#039;ve never found anyone that this isn&#039;t the case for. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you haven&#039;t made bank and I am not saying you don&#039;t understand the world. I just don&#039;t feel the need to change things because they work for me as they are and to be real with you I don&#039;t care too much about other people than the main people in my life. I&#039;m out to make a lot of money that I can build a real future with and then retire from drug dealing and live my life. I don&#039;t feel the need to change the world or be a revolutionary etc, it&#039;s not really in my mindset. <br /><br />

However I am not fatalistic, I just accept the world for what is and that you have to manipulate it to get what you want. You can buy everyone for a price and I&#039;ve never found anyone that this isn&#039;t the case for. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you haven&#039;t made bank and I am not saying you don&#039;t understand the world. I just don&#039;t feel the need to change things because they work for me as they are and to be real with you I don&#039;t care too much about other people than the main people in my life. I&#039;m out to make a lot of money that I can build a real future with and then retire from drug dealing and live my life. I don&#039;t feel the need to change the world or be a revolutionary etc, it&#039;s not really in my mindset.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s entirely up to you how you view it and live your life. Capitalism is not actually a religion. There is the philosophy, the theoretical framework, and then the economic function that revolves around your actions. They are related but different. Lots of people claim to be socialists, but invest money, have credit cards, participate in the fractional reverse banking system, which is a bit mind boggling to me. Most people are against capitalism in theory (usually because they are illiterate) but for capitalism in practice. And you can&#039;t buy a pine. But I suppose if you acquired platypuses it could be different. <br /><br />When you need shelter/food of course you are motivated to search for them, but if you have 100 units of shelter and food it starts to become boring. You may want a nice burrow today, but there is a upper limit on how much capital you acquire before you obtain other goals. It could be a million, a billion or more, but there is a limit. This is why very wealthy people aren&#039;t even really aware of their wealth in practical terms, which is an immensely desirable freedom that you are currently seeking to obtain. Simple freedoms like walking down a supermarket isle without having to think about the prices, that is something. It is that freedom you want most, not specific goods or services. I&#039;m not trivializing that because I think its important. I&#039;m just saying, after that, then what?<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be a &quot;revolutionary&quot;, that&#039;s just one way of thinking about it. Maybe Limet will discover a desire to create fine art, space tourism, novel writing or even to collect all the pokemon. It depends on the person.<br /><br />Pine&#039;s revolutionary vision: making platypus farms and teaching them all military grade encryption. My platypus will be the best cryptographers. I don&#039;t know how they&#039;ll get on with my cats though.

				By being alive I&#039;m funding all those things. By working as a cell of society, I&#039;m funding all those things. Plus, who said I took drugs? I think the problem lies within your outlook. Obviously, any successful man has a system of self-rationalizing for everything they do or they wouldn&#039;t be able to function properly; you&#039;re not wrong there. But instead of seeing how we can get a piece of the action, maybe we can see how to make the world a better place based on our strong-suits? <br /><br />Or you could always cause disruption amongst the upper class, that&#039;s my backup plan :D

A relative told me she used to drive past one of the locations on her way to work. I could find out the location, but I&#039;m not sure how often they move them. It was there for at least three years, but then she stopped going to that job and hasn&#039;t driven past them for a few years now. It must have been for opium cultivation, why else would you need acres of opium poppies that are harvested on an industrial scale?<br /><br />I found out quiet a bit about the manufacture of medical morphine in the UK by fishing around online. Like where the opium goes to be refined and then where the largest distributor of medical morphine is based, even how to order it (need to be licenced though). I often wondered if any of the UK crime firms have ever thought of robbing the production route at some point? Would be worth a lot of money, but I bet the securities shit hot.

				well I find it very interesting as far as the power struggle goes. I agree with you that it&#039;s all about the Benjamin s. So who ever is controlling the drugs are the ones with the most money right? So they put on this charade about the war on drugs and the just say no campaign and main stream public believes whatever they see on the television. Knowledge is power but ignorance really is bliss so how can one have faith in a government that has been proven to lie and cheat it&#039;s citizens? Nobodies vote makes any difference at all. I am not racist or against the other gendor but I believe the best person for the job should have that job. In my opinion John Mcain didn&#039;t get elected president because congress wanted to show the world that we are not racist. What was Obama&#039;s experience? 1 term as a senator? I&#039;m not a big Mcain fan but I felt he would have been the better front man because after all, the president is just a front man. What about all that shit with Bill Clinton and George Bush trafficking all that cocaine to Arkansas? And Ricky Ross buying kilos from the DEA for half price? Our congress is our cartel. I think the 4 year term should apply to every government employee all the way down to the janitors. Everyone should get a chance to have those kinds of benefits. $ years and thats it. Go back to regular society after that cops, judges, congressmen, the whole fucking bunch of them. With that we would have a new bunch in there every 4 years and corruption would be cut a little but at least everyone would have a chance to live that kind of high life.

				because I&#039;ll never have a chance to have a government job and enjoy those kinds of benefits unless I win the lottery or one of my books becomes a best seller. It does anger me a bit but only when I think about it. I am still paying a debt to society for a ten year old felony. I need a new job now so I can have my record exponged so I can get a better job. My job options are very limited and they are minimum wage or under the table. The last under the table job I worked I had to fight tooth and nail to get my pay and still did not get it all. So I have learned the hard way that when somebody wrongs me then it&#039;s best to let God handle it for me. That guy just got arrested and had to pay 1300 dollars plus he still has a court day and I had nothing to do with it. <br /><br />No I try not to get negative about anything because I have seen the evidence of how your thoughts can actually mold your reality. I have seen some crazy shit that I never would have believed 2 years ago. Two simple words can perform miracles and those words are &quot;thank you&quot;. By keeping those thoughts in my mind, I&#039;ve seen the world bend to my will and it continues to do so and when negative thoughts enter then fucked up shit happens so it&#039;s best to let the negatives flow in and out easily and find a reason to say thank you whatever that reason is because it will cause more reasons to be thankful. Yea it&#039;s corny as hell but it works

				Lim, you don&#039;t have to be Dr Freud to see that when people are treated like dumbasses, they have an inherent tendency resent it.<br /><br />When you&#039;re told one thing, and the evidence of your eyes says another, then you have a case of the State saying &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot;, which is a contradiction, it is implying there is one set of rules for the rulers and one set of rules for everybody else.<br /><br />Humans simply don&#039;t like these inconsistencies because nobody likes to be tricked and made a fool of. e.g. a minor example is a child told to go to bed at 9pm, but it is actually 7pm and the child&#039;s parents have simply moved the clock forward by 2 hours. This may or may not have traumatized a pint sized pine upon discovery, leading to conspiratorial and paranoid/analytical thinking later in life.<br /><br />There you go!

Any idiot can work that out for themselves. <br /><br />My point is that if you can see the light through the dark then fair enough, well done and a pat on the back you doth certainly deserve. BUT SAYING THAT, if you can then why do we think that you as one single person voicing what your logic has brought you to perceive to be the truth is going to do anything? It wont and that has become quite apparent through history all the way back from when civilization first began. Even when things are perceived to have changed, in reality they most certainly haven&#039;t.<br /><br />It just strikes me that people that think that by talking about things they perceive to be true, especially thing like this are pissed because they don&#039;t have the power themselves because, and let&#039;s be real here, there will never be an equal or egalitarian society. This is because when it boils down to it and all the dust from the revolution has cleared that humans are pack animals and that means there is always a pecking order and thus you have your Gods and you have your Clods. I firmly believe that anyone can work their way up the ladder by making the right connections even if you have to play it a little dynastic so you lay a foundation for your kids to step up from. <br /><br />Even myself, I don&#039;t come from wealth, in fact quite the reverse. But by the time I have quit this dance and long after that when I have children they will be going to the best fee paying schools and they&#039;ll have all the opportunities I never had. Look at how the Kennedy family started out in America, Poppa Kenedy made bank from booze in the prohibition era and then JFK ended up as President even if he did get murked. Like I said, don&#039;t fight the system, play it and manipulate it so it works for you.

Any advantages gained are usually temporary and maintenance of control becomes cyclic, it is rather similar to drug tolerance side effect. Next time you ride up with a baseball bat, people will be ready with knives, and so it goes. Since we are talking about heroin in this thread, compare and contrast the Italian Mafia and the Nigerian Igbo. Both deal in heroin. But although everybody imagines the Mafia have No.1 position in the market, this is not true. In fact the Igbo have control over approximately 90% of the market directly and indirectly, but almost nobody has heard of them. Do you know why? Because they don&#039;t kill, torture or threaten very many people. In fact in Igbo culture violence is relatively unusual in comparison to the Italian crime syndicates. This neatly puts them out of the spotlight, and they just deal. The key thing is ROI and they know it.<br /><br />Similarly, SR is highly effective at allowing vendors to &#039;just deal&#039;. All that macho bullshit belongs to the 20th century. Something like 10 or 20 vendors have already been kicked off this site for threatening their customers. At SR, customer is King and we have a symbiotic relationship.<br /><br />Violence should be necessary only in the situation where we are defending ourselves against the enemy. This is not a idealistic philosophy, it is a pragmatic one. Violence is a last resort, but if it comes necessary to apply it, I shall not hold back my paw. You&#039;ll notice LE agents adopt zero tolerance policies when their fellows are murdered (even if it is not a written rule). This is in fact for good reason, otherwise anybody in the wrong uniform becomes a target across the city and a cycle of intimidation begins leading to more cop deaths. It is necessary, as they know well, to cut off any possible retaliation by use of overwhelming force to extinguish all opposition. This ultimately saves more lives than it kills. So, killing cops is a dumb idea on several accounts. But if the police begin indiscriminately murdering hundreds of drug vendors in some manner of moral purge, like the one Chairman Mao orchestrated, then it is a fight to the death.<br /><br />Basically, it behooves both drug vendors and LE to stay within the rules of the game, and that is why non violence is always preferable to violence. kmfkewm and shannon have mentioned rationales for punishing state violence via mail bombing, but that is a non-starter for me on 2 accounts. <br /><br />1. It is bad and obviously I have sympathy for drug war victims but there is no purge. One, or even a group of cops making a dumb mistake is not the same as a nation wide purge.<br />2. If you have to retaliate, then mail bombing is simply ineffective. It is indirect, meaning collateral damage and bad PR = less supporters and it also doesn&#039;t kill anywhere near enough people to be an example of overwhelming force. It&#039;s like using a peashooters vs a cannon.<br /><br />So in summation, the argument against coercion is that (google game theory: prisoner&#039;s dilemma scenario) it is usually Tit for Tat algorithm works most optimally, with the proviso that you initially cooperate with the other fellow in a gesture of good faith.<br /><br />Now you may be thinking: Ah! Those geeks! Hilarious! They know nothing of the &quot;Real World&quot;.<br /><br />But actually the geeks are always right. And do you know what Limetless? In some ways the geeks have bigger guns.

Any true patriot should be looking at the state of America&#039;s morality on this subject with great concern. Why is there so little public protest over the fact America has a concentration camp on its doorstep? I didn&#039;t have much hope for Obama but I did hope he&#039;d reverse the trend of increasing state paranoia. So I&#039;m as disillusioned as a democrat.<br />

				Lol I was pulling your leg about the man/woman thing Pine, I think you should know full well that I could give less of a fuck what you are lol. It is of no interest to me in the slightest. You need to chill. :P<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid we are going to have to agree to disagree with you on your thoughts on coercion. I don&#039;t really see the real world as an algorithm, isn&#039;t in my mindset to do so and I find that when people do it&#039;s an inherently floored outlook to take. <br /><br />Also, the &quot;we are always right&quot; doesn&#039;t really make my ears prick up much either.

They DO understand.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you go to medical school, one of the first things they will flash at the student are statistics and graphs about how much abuse/mortality from prescription drugs have risen in last 20 years while the abuse/mortality from &quot;street&quot; or illegal substances have not changed much.<br /><br />In the medical field, the opioid problem begun in 80s when the medical industry decided to include &quot;pain&quot; as one of the vital signs of the patient.&nbsp; Thus, if there was ANY pain, the doctors were taught to supply the patients with painkillers to eradicate pain at all cost.&nbsp; Now, the FDA, AMA, and DEA have seen the result of this practice.&nbsp; Patients are now going into hospitals to be treated and coming out as narcotic addicts.<br /><br />DEA is coming down HARD on doctors and pharmacies now than ever.&nbsp; Many states have or are in process of incorporating centralized narcotics prescription database for all patients<br /><br />DEA actually just took away DEA license from two CVS pharmacies in Florida last month.&nbsp; This is the first time such thing happened to a huge national chain pharmacy like CVS who thought they were infallible.<br /><br />Many pharmaceutical companies are focusing on making newer and synthetic painkillers without the addictiveness of the opioid derivative painkillers because it will be hugely promoted and heavily used in the medical community if such drug came out in the current crisis of prescription addiction we&#039;re facing.<br /><br />Sorry for the random conjecture, I haven&#039;t read the whole thread but just wanted to drop my 2 cents.

Ever since morphine appeared over a hundred years ago the opium derivatives have become increasingly addictive and less medicinally effective. Whole opium is a much safer drug than it&#039;s derivatives. This is why I get so pissed off when I see H and opium lumped together, it maligns the character of opium, &quot;heroin&quot; is an emotive word, decades of prohibition propaganda make it practically impossible for the word not to conjour images of destitution and depravity in the minds of most average &quot;straight&quot; people, (anyone remember Zammo off Grange Hill?) and heroin to some extent deserves it&#039;s reputation, please don&#039;t (black) tar opium with the same brush.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t &quot;do the opium/heroin thing&quot; in future, because although I&#039;ve seen that you understand the considerable differences between the two substances it&#039;s clear that the majority of people, even here, don&#039;t (see the post a little further up) and this is something I feel should be rectified, disinformation about drugs is a weapon of the prohibitionists, we as drug users should be disseminating information, not disinformation, and in my humble opinion this &quot;opium/heroin&quot; only serves to further the myth that they are the same thing, which they aren&#039;t.<br /><br />Peace&nbsp;

				@Neville Bartoz&nbsp; Sorry, but most of what your saying is just rubbish. Here is some articles I&#039;ve copied and pasted from Wikipedia, which I&#039;ve edited to leave the points I feel are most relevant. :)<br /><br />Opium contains two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine are the main narcotic constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10%–16% of the total. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptor in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Both analgesia and drug addiction are functions of the mu opioid receptor, the class of opioid receptor first identified as responsive to morphine.<br /><br />Heroin (diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate (INN)), also known as diamorphine (BAN), is an opiate analgesic synthesized by C.R. Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine found in the opium poppy. When used in medicine it is typically used to treat severe pain. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of morphine, and functions as a morphine prodrug (meaning that it is metabolically converted to morphine inside the body in order for it to work). Under the chemical name diamorphine, diacetylmorphine is prescribed as a strong analgesic in the United Kingdom. Its use includes treatment for acute pain, such as in severe physical trauma, myocardial infarction, post-surgical pain, and chronic pain, including end-stage cancer and other terminal illnesses. In other countries it is more common to use morphine or other strong opioids in these situations. The advantage of diacetylmorphine over morphine is that diacetylmorphine is more fat soluble and therefore more potent (by injection only), so smaller doses of it are needed for the same analgesic effect. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the subcutaneous route, which is often necessary in palliative care.<br /><br />In China recreational use of this drug began in the fifteenth century but was limited by its rarity and expense. Opium trade became more regular by the seventeenth century, when it was mixed with tobacco for smoking, and addiction was first recognized. Opium prohibition in China began in 1729 yet was followed by nearly two centuries of increasing opium use. China had a positive balance sheet in trading with the British, which led to a decrease of the British silver stocks. Therefore, the British tried to encourage Chinese opium use to enhance their balance, and they delivered it from Indian provinces under British control. In India, its cultivation, as well as the manufacture and traffic to China, were subject to the East India Company, as a strict monopoly of the British government. A massive confiscation of opium by the Chinese emperor, who tried to stop the opium deliveries, led to two Opium Wars in 1839 and 1858, in which Britain suppressed China and traded opium all over the country. After 1860, opium use continued to increase with widespread domestic production in China, until more than a quarter of the male population were regular consumers by 1905.<br /><br />Global regulation of opium began with the stigmatization of Chinese immigrants and opium dens in San Francisco, California, leading rapidly from town ordinances in the 1870s to the formation of the International Opium Commission in 1909. During this period, the portrayal of opium in literature became squalid and violent, British opium trade was largely supplanted by domestic Chinese production, purified morphine and heroin became widely available for injection, and patent medicines containing opiates reached a peak of popularity. Opium was prohibited in many countries during the early twentieth century, leading to the modern pattern of opium production as a precursor for illegal recreational drugs or tightly regulated legal prescription drugs. Illicit opium production, now dominated by Afghanistan, was decimated in 2000 when production was banned by the Taliban, but has increased steadily since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and over the course of the War in Afghanistan. Worldwide production in 2006 was 6610 metric tons—nearly one-fifth the level of production in 1906.<br /><br />

Hoarding metals has historically lead to conflict in at least two occasions I can think of. One person hoarding isn&#039;t an issue, but an entire nation doing it can lead to ruin. It brought down the Spanish and Chinese imperial powers (for different reasons, the Spanish one was superinflation) and probably others too. Although I disagree with Keynes&#039;s ideas, the fact of the matter is that he is correct that hoarding can become a real problem (I&#039;m not keen on his solution, but the problem is real). If humans were rational as a full unit or set, hoarding shouldn&#039;t occur. The Chinese would have traded because it benefited them, a positive sum game (you could argue fairly successfully here the real problem was massive centralization [so that some people in the Chinese government benefited hugely from suppressing other people&#039;s freedoms even though as a whole the Chinese people lost out] with the Opium Wars simply being a side effect, a kind of diabolical excuse and that sooner or later War would have broken out on some kind of pretext anyway).<br /><br />tldr; Centralization works on a small scale temporarily, but on a large scale (or if it continues for too long on a small scale) it leads to irrationality. For more, see &quot;Communism&quot;. This is why Bitcoin is so important. It is decentralized and nobody controls output or distribution. Bitcoin may ultimately fail in its current incarnation, but cryptocurrencies are an opportunity to make a break with the past and will cause the world to become a more rational place. The paradox: That nobody has power, implies we all gain power indirectly as a result. Very zen I feel. It is as if power in the human world, just as in physics, cannot be created or destroyed but only moved around in different ways, where centralization is collecting it into one place like a sandhill and markets are kicking it all over the beach. One looks more impressive than the other at first, but if you&#039;re around for a while you appreciate the subtle power of the market.<br /><br />Note: All of the above is part of the reason that shutting down cryptocurrencies merely because they are used for illicit purposes is madness. There is the potential for a much, much better world than the one we currently live in, even if you don&#039;t like the Silk Road and darknet markets in particular. We are just the early adopters, we&#039;re doing the world a giant fucking favor by supporting cryptocurrency for reasons of self interest. Nonetheless, I don&#039;t expect LE to see that, so they will try to shut down the B$ exchanges sooner or later.<br /><br />^ that&#039;s quite a tldr; I got going there, soz...<br /><br />Real tldr; Bitcoin! Wooooooooooooot! Bitcoin! Fuck yeah!

So one plant produces two powerful drugs with large consumer bases. I am not confusing h and opium, I know they&#039;re different.<br /><br />It&#039;s marvelous that the poppy produces so many useful drugs, if you look at all, and I do mean nearly all, the major painkillers that actually work, they are all poppy based e.g. Vicodin, codeine, morphine et al. Opiates are exceptionally powerful drugs, and to be honest I don&#039;t think the scientific establishment actually understands them because there are far more people addicted to doctor&#039;s prescriptions of some opiate derivative than recreational drug consumers. <br /><br />Since we are mentioning bugbears, my bugbear is that everybody seems to use, even in scientific papers, the word &#039;narcotic&#039; as a label for many illegal drugs, as if it were a synonym. Actually narcotic are a very specific group of drugs, namely the opiates, morphine, heroin, codeine and opium being the major ones. All the other drugs are not narcotics.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking at you Mr Nicolas Christin. -.-<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Please don&#039;t &quot;do the opium/heroin thing&quot; in future, because although I&#039;ve seen that you understand the considerable differences between the two substances it&#039;s clear that the majority of people, even here, don&#039;t (see the post a little further up) and this is something I feel should be rectified, disinformation about drugs is a weapon of the prohibitionists, we as drug users should be disseminating information, not disinformation, and in my humble opinion this &quot;opium/heroin&quot; only serves to further the myth that they are the same thing, which they aren&#039;t.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Nev, I believe that this is what a forum is for.

Pine is clearly a crazy conspiracy theorist because there is no way that the American government would try to control poppy agronomy and therefore its principal product: morphine.<br /><br />I find it funny that when production is down, it&#039;s reported as about &quot;preventing heroin supply&quot; and when product goes way up, it&#039;s about &quot;stabilizing the Afghan economy to prevent terrorists getting up to their old tricks&quot;. Whatever sounds sweet to the listener.<br /><br />It&#039;s an hilarious argument given that the Taliban cut poppy production&nbsp; by 95% the year before the Americans invaded.<br /><br />The idea that nobody is controlling morphine supply is simply flying in the face of the numbers and their distribution. The UN states that there is a severe morphine shortage in the developing world for some time now, only 6% of the morphine makes its way to 80% of the population. It&#039;s not as if they don&#039;t have the money, I mean these are some of the producer countries and their neighbors we&#039;re talking about, for them it should essentially be at rock bottom prices. Yet it is not, which is probably because they don&#039;t control it.

Secret? To a majority of the civil population perhaps. But hundreds of thousands of people outside of them doubtless understood what was going on. There is such a thing as an &#039;open secret&#039;, which is just information that belongs to a niche group. The American government for example, knew about the concentration camps long before the European Invasion was on the cards. They may not have known how bad it was getting, but lots of people knew about them. <br /><br />In just the same way we all know about Guantanamo Bay for example. It is a concentration camp and it is not an especially secret one. It is also not news to folk that America has a large quantity of secret prisons throughout Europe, the Middle East and America. If e.g. the Chinese suddenly took over the world and opened those secret prisons, and found the kind of dreadful conditions and brutality seen in post war Nazi Germany, then what do pine and bob have to say for themselves? <br /><br />Are we members of the conspiracy because we may know that they exist and didn&#039;t do anything about them, that we didn&#039;t inquire further to find out what the situation is in these state facilities? Remember how German corporations cooperated to turn the camps into well oiled machines, not merely German ones, but also American ones like IBM. This may have given a false sense of normality to observers, that these were just typical war camps. A difficult life perhaps, but not cruel and murderous.<br /><br />Similar conspiracies went on in Europe later, with the Stazi spying on just about every single person in East Germany, with the records to prove it. Again, an open conspiracy. Nobody knows here. Some know there, but they spread the message about it in vain because most people don&#039;t want to hear it.<br /><br />In short, your idea that conspiracies require tightly held secrets in order to function is evidently completely wrong. Those conspiracies are rare, and are in fact a good sign in a government because they prove the participants know they need to hold their cards close to their chest in order for their plan to succeed. Most real world conspiracies match my description of them.

Perhaps I should be more diplomatic, but I shall never make a good equivocator. I don&#039;t think tearing apart somebody&#039;s argument qualifies as rude. Calling people names or attacking them personally, yes. It is true that by use of word play you can get far more people to agree with your ideas, but that always seemed a bit* dishonest to me. Surely if an idea is good, it ultimately ought to stand on its own merit. So, straight talking has the downside of appearing unfeeling sometimes, but it also takes away linguistic fluff and fuzzy logic.<br /><br />* See! I said &quot;a bit dishonest&quot;. Diplomacy!

If people are stupid enough, and believe me they are, why stunt your progress trying to reverse their thoughts by logic when you can do it with emotion? The average American has an IQ of 90. The average chimp is at 65, which is closer to the average American if you&#039;re even mildly intelligent (No wonder the upper class look down at them). You wouldn&#039;t use logic to enlighten a chimp, would you?

				WOW, I have to say WOW, because I absolutely love the chaos that is happening here. lol<br /><br />I&#039;ve read all of the 8 pages and this has been a good past time and I thought that adding my 2 cents to the pile of 100s will do good. :)<br /><br />I won&#039;t be bothered to quote every said sentence, but I&#039;ll do my best to address some of the debate that is going on here.<br /><br />So, Imho, this thread is more about conspiracy theories than it is about the facts that we have. We all love to debate about topics that are bigger than us and what could be a better topic than a worldwide conspiracy theory?? The answer is simple: NOTHING! <br /><br />But what comes to me as a surprise is that so many people in this &quot;debate&quot; have forgotten the sound of reason and aren&#039;t thinking objectively nor rationally. It comes to me as a shock that people tend to forget their wits when it comes to topics that don&#039;t even touch them nor hurt them in any way.<br /><br />I get it that some people here are for the better of all human kind. What comes to mind, is what pine said, and what I&#039;d say to her/him, &quot;Do as I say, don&#039;t do as I do.&quot; I find it simply contradicting when at one point people are saying that: &quot;Oh I want to help the world and I want to help it prosper!&quot; and it the following sentence: &quot;I&#039;ve made a lot of money manipulating the system and NOW(after I&#039;ve made the money) I wish to help it!&quot; It&#039;s like USA when they told the developing countries to stop polluting at the rate they&#039;re at the moment and to level their polluting levels with USA&#039;s(a developed country). <br /><br />Why are people even talking about the opium or the heroin when this topic is created to show something entirely different? <br /><br />I guess that&#039;s the wonder of a debate(not a well organized one, at least).<br /><br />~~sitamaja

And according to the United Nations, there’s been another 18 per cent growth in the heroin trade, in just the past year.<br />&nbsp;It goes to show that, even in the most difficult circumstances, with a popular product and thoughtful marketing, there are always business opportunities for those with a flair for entrepreneurial vision. At the time of the initial invasion in 2001, Tony Blair insisted that one of the reasons for occupying Afghanistan was because “the Taliban are causing the deaths of young British people who buy their drugs on the streets”. But clearly some people misunderstood what Blair meant. They were saying that the Afghan heroin trade wasn’t fulfilling its potential, and with the right management they could treble it.<br />&nbsp;It will probably turn out Blair is getting £4m a year to sit on an advisory board to help them maximise growth. Spokesmen from companies with names like Kwik-Fix Global will appear on the business section of Sky News, explaining how their quarterly report reveals a 35 per cent rise in dividends, boasting about surveys that show that the Afghan brand earns positive feedback with 95 per cent of junkies, and hinting at diversification into other markets such as its own brand of needles so customers can enjoy the full Afghan warlord poppy experience.<br />&nbsp;Maybe the plan is that, by the time British troops leave, every district of Afghanistan has a thriving garden centre, where couples from Helmand province can potter around on a Sunday, arguing about which seeds will produce the most effective skag and enquiring about how to set up a poppy rockery.<br />&nbsp;Then there’ll be an Afghan Gardeners’ Question Time, with the audience asking: “This year, my poppy window-box became susceptible to mildew around springtime, so the opium was disappointingly soggy and hard to burn in the spoon. Has the panel any suggestions for how to prevent a recurrence?” <br />&nbsp;It could be claimed that the growth in heroin production would be even greater if the occupying forces hadn’t been in the country. But this would be to deny them the credit they’re due. Because it was also revealed this week that the office of Afghan leader Harmid Karzai has been regularly receiving envelopes stuffed with cash from the CIA, for the past 11 years. The New York Times reported that the money has come in “backpacks, suitcases and plastic bags”. <br />&nbsp;The allegations are denied by a Foreign Ministry spokesman, but Karzai explained the purpose of these payments was to “secure the support of those leaders who have been loyal”. One of the other reasons for the invasion, you may recall, was to stamp out corruption. That makes sense, because you can’t stamp out corruption without the support of honest, reliable officials, and you can’t expect them to stay honest and reliable for nothing so it makes sense to hand them envelopes stuffed with cash every couple of weeks.<br />&nbsp;The people the money has been handed to are local warlords, who won’t stay loyal unless they’re also allowed to carry on their legitimate business of growing poppies, so it all completes a neat business circle. To make it seem even more like a typical business arrangement, some of them have complained that the amount that the local farmers receive for their poppies is only 1 per cent of the eventual market value. You’d think that at least our Government would insist on an ethical poppy policy, encouraging dealers to pay a decent price so they could stand behind the bins on a council estate wearing a sticker saying “All our smack is Fairtrade”, next to a picture of a smiling warlord. <br />&nbsp;Once you add in the other reasons for occupying the place, the scale of the occupation’s success becomes even clearer. There was the Taliban’s “appalling record on human rights”, whereas Saudi Arabia, with which we’ve just concluded a £15bn arms deal, is just a constant hubbub of feminist this and lesbian that. <br />&nbsp;It is so liberal that it’s the only country where women get no extra penalty if they’re caught drinking and driving, as they get put in jail for either so they might as well do both at the same time. And the invasion was supposed to stop Afghanistan being a centre for al-Qa’ida, which has gone exceedingly well. Because now Afghanistan is only one place for the militant Islamist organisation, as they’ve grown in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Mali, and a variety of places where they didn’t exist before. Once they’ve taken control of Dorset County Council, I suppose the job will be complete.<br />&nbsp;When British and US forces first occupied Kabul in 2001, there was jubilation from those who’d supported the invasion, especially those who saw it as a humanitarian policy. Some day soon, I suppose they’ll accept it hasn’t all gone to plan as much as they thought. Or they might stick it out, following the Government’s line that we’re leaving because we’ve done an excellent job, and now the Afghans we’ve been giving stuffed envelopes to have learned enough from us that they can carry on from here. <br />&nbsp;If only Napoleon had thought of this tactic. He could have said: “Right, it’s all gone very well, but, if you Russians don’t mind, we’ve got other stuff to get on with, so you’re jolly well going to have to get on without us. Bye then, thanks for having us.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />QFT<br /><br />Exactly the sort of contempt our western leaders deserve for this epic clusterfuck. As Machiavelli would appreciate, there is something worse than being unpopular for a nation state, and that is being seen as being utterly incompetent. If our modern day Praetorian guard actually had any balls they would have executed the upper echelon of the previous administrations for treason. In fact that can still happen.<br /><br />It comes down to this: what is the practical difference between fucking up on purpose and fucking up through inability to function? There isn&#039;t one. The result is the same. Libertarians, despite not usually having a country specific nationalism in common with the military, think in similar ways, we both think that discipline is necessary for freedom e.g. the freedom to take heroin does not imply you should take it. Pleasure is not the highest goal in life by a long shot.<br /><br />The socialists are always afraid of a military dictatorship, with reasonable cause too. It can turn into a bloodbath. But they often overlook the fact that the central reason why practically every military dictatorship comes into existence is because the central administration is seen as weak, ineffectual, treasonous by default through ineptitude. It is very easy to argue that there have been times in history where a military dictatorship was preferable to the alternative. Democracy supporters find such a topic abhorrent, but military dictatorships have become democracies before now. The history of the world is not an easy reading for an unsophisticated democrat.<br /><br />Putting it as bluntly as possible: if the democracy camp does not manage to get its shit together in the USA and UK, the far right wing is going to do it for them. This is a hypothesis with great explanatory power for the changes in politics over the last few years. <br /><br />To reiterate, Pine is not a nationalist and stands by the non-aggression principal as the line in the sand, but this is just how it is on the world stage, the world does not share my philosophy. This is the logic the West is trending towards more and more. Guantanamo Bay and other secret prisons the previous democracy based administrations have built are an absolute abomination on the face of the West. It goes against all our cultural values, including that of our armed forces. Either the enemy dies honorably on the field of battle when he doesn&#039;t surrender, or he is captured and given a strict but fair military trial. Again, I will be blunt. The ONLY reason we have that concentration camp is democracy. All data supports that claim.<br /><br />Our armed forces from the ground floor to the highest echelons of strategic cognition&nbsp; are in an awful catch-22. They have accomplished their jobs with great skill, their institutions have by and large done precisely what they are supposed to. To anybody who takes umbridge at this: the object of the armed forces and their strategic masters can only be either defense or invasion. Keeping the peace, making the economy prosper and all those infinite other necessaries is simply way out of their jurisdiction. To make them responsible for these others is tantamount to encouraging them to think about politics, which isn&#039;t their job, but which they are almost certainly going to now think it is. I mean Jesus Christ, just join the dots, the consequences of putting a military force in charge of governance overseas should not be rocket science. You think those patterns wouldn&#039;t reestablish themselves when they are back on home territory? Of course they will, it&#039;s just a matter of time. Bush and Blair have laid down the seeds for the potential future destruction of their countries. <br /><br /><br />
