				All my favorite vendors pulled all their listings! Some ever have 1/5 reviews from multiple buyers stating they got scammed. This sucks dick! Everyone I&#039;ve trusted is gone and/or turned into a scammer! WTF?!?!

				Seems kind of extreme.<br /><br />Why not hang around the forums and see if you can meet some new more reliable ones.<br /><br />Besides I suppose that&#039;s how the dope game goes... people get tired of risking their lives and freedom selling product.

				i think many are playing catch up from the 4/20 sale. Be patient. they work 7 days a week and have a lot of work.&nbsp; Sometimes they need a break or decide to move on. T76 says hes catching up, as far as the 1/5 ratings im not sure who you&#039;re talking about

I&#039;m sure this site has been through quite a number of ordeals in the past year, but you know what? It&#039;s still here! I&#039;m confident that DPR knows what he&#039;s doing, and unless there&#039;s some solid evidence that we&#039;re in the slightest bit of danger there&#039;s no reason to raise any alarm. Perhaps next time any of you feel worried, I recommend you listen to divine chemicals advice and just toke it up and relax. 8)

				Line of defense 1 - DPR and the security measure this man has implemented. I&#039;ve been known to be overly trusting, but I have faith in this guy. As should everyone.<br /><br />Line of defense 2 - Personal security measures. Take some if you want.

				You may not give a fuck but vendors certainly do.

Some people actually NEED this shit. It sucks, but it is what it is. I know if I went to the store, paid for some vodka with the last of my money and got water, I&#039;d be PISSED. And fucked. <br /><br />We all have our vices. Some a bit moreso than others.

				Vendors come and go, that&#039;s how it&#039;s been since the beginning of SR.&nbsp; New sellers will come along to make up the difference, as they have in the past.&nbsp; No reason to be paranoid - remember, even though this is SR, the people you&#039;re buying from are still drug dealers.&nbsp; So pretty much by definition they aren&#039;t going to be around forever.
