				I saw that DZF was proved to be a sting in a thread on the OVDB sub forum, can anyone elaborate a bit on that a bit? like what happened? <br /><br />Other questions, what happened to the infamous toxic/rater? Is he still around?<br /><br />Did the admin from OS pay the people he ripped off?<br /><br />What happened to thefinancepage crew?<br /><br />BBS crew?<br /><br />Any of my NA film appreciators on here? ;) <br /><br />Just using my old name to catch up with people and check out the &#039;state of the scene&#039;, I&#039;ll be changing to something anonymous soon.

				I posted some details about dzf in the other thread. I thought toxic1 went to prison btw, although I never cared enough to verify it firsthand.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recall your name, but welcome back to this game. :)

				There is not currently a forum for BBS crew, but some are still around forums and more keep in touch<br />OS (not OVDB) admin never paid back the people he ripped<br />toxic is still around and probably runs half of the scams here<br />dzf was run by the FBI according to one of the vendors who was busted there, not that it was a surprise to anyone with two brain cells to rub together<br />
