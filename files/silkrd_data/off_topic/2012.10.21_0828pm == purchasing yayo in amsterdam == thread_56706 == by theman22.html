				A streetdealer and an undercoverreporter or journalist you cant see the difference.<br />You can try coffeeshops but the risk will always be there to get caught.<br /><br />Regards,Mercury31

				Very good coke there always, if you know who to approach. Not many street sales of coke anymore, mostly just distribution in Am. But lemme tell you, Paris - boy that was a whole &#039;nother world - the balls those guys had offering up to the uniformed police in the metro station.

				You wont have a problem getting it, i was there a few months ago, was in dam square around five minutes and was approached by an assortment of dealers of all age and and race it was excellent!I got sorted out with some epic class A&#039;s, just look like a tourist but make sure they know your not just some dunce who&#039;l take any old shit!

				I think there&#039;s deffinetly a good chance you can find a C dealer but the quality of the c can be really poor because they see you as a tourist and they can fuck arround with you.<br />You can try the coffeeshop but try to bring it not to directly also they can think your an reporter or a cop just very difficult to get good c from the streets.<br />Also can be dangerous in amsterdam to purchase C.<br />Maybe you can find a domestic vendor on SR who can send it to your hotel address or the address were your staying.<br />Domestic shipping will come 99% the only thing is your still paying the SR price but thats the quality.<br />There a lot of good vendors in The Netherlands i think the only way to buy good clean c is this way.<br />Or you need balls like tony montana to ask people who look they can hook yha up.

				Hey habberdasher,<br /><br />Domestic shipping comes the next day on workindays.<br />Express shipping international comes between 4 and 8 days(working days)<br />Only aus does longer.<br /><br />On topic.<br /><br />Theres a new thing in the netherlands a weedpass you only can get weed in shops with this pass..<br />dont know if this is also allready in amsterdam many shops do not agree.<br />Also if this is so you have a lot of street dealers hanging arround you just have to find the wright one and hope it isnt a decoy.

				I lived here for nine months and I really wouldn&#039;t suggest getting anything from any of the street dealers. Most are homeless guys trying to rip off tourists and I can&#039;t tell you how many I met who had been sold sugar or salt or sand. And it&#039;s super sketch. Your best bet is to go to one of the regular clubs like the Winston on Cheeky Monday for DnB night, Trouw, Paridiso, Studio 80 and hang out around the smokiing area and look for people who may have extras to sell, usually if they&#039;re rolling is a good way to tell if they have a good contact. Luckily good drugs are very good in Amsterdam and can be affordable. I was good friends with a drug dealer while I was there and was so spoiled. I would expect to pay 60-80 euro a gram as a tourist, though wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it was higher because that&#039;s the non-Dutch tax. Also, try anyone working at a hostel. Look for ex-pats from England or Spain. They usually know where to get the hook up. Hope that helps!

				It was a shit show to say the least. Lots and lots of fun but too long there kind of messes with you if you&#039;re not careful. I moved to Spain and stopped everything but the occasional spliff and heavy drinking and it took about 2 months to get the fogginess to go away. Have a blast! If you&#039;re into dance music, some of the best clubs are there. The dutch really know how to party.
