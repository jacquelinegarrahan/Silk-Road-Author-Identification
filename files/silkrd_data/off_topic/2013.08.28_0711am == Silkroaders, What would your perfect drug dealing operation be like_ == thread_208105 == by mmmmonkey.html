				Anyone who believes they are running the perfect operation, are not likely to share any details of such! Doing so in itself then renders your operation, &quot;No Longer Perfect&quot;, knowledge is power &amp; all that.....<br /><br />Peace.

				I meant outside of the law of course lol. And as a person who buys from SR and distributes to their local area, what would be the most perfect operation you can think of?

				The answer is you don&#039;t. You are mixing the most risky part of SR (buying internationally, repeatedly) and the most risky part of real world dealing (selling small amounts, repeatedly).

I&#039;ve been thinking about doing what the OP&#039;s been talking about by sourcing stuff from overseas to sell IRL but it&#039;s the mix of these very two factors that hold me back from commencing. But then again my vendors stealth are on some next level shit and I can always trust that they&#039;d get through. Plus once I setup and get a bit of money behind me to invest back into to the business so to speak I would then establish a few different delivery spots to mix it up and insulate myself from being picked up by LE.<br /><br />The perfect operation however in the sense that you speak of would predominantly consist of you sourcing your product from a vendor with premium quality product that is guaranteed to surpass the competition in your area at a price that&#039;s so cheap you can re-order more product within the first few sales you make because you&#039;re going to be waiting a while for your product to come in if you&#039;re not ordering with international express shipping. <br />You&#039;re going to need to have more than one address and one name to receive your packages under and those addresses and names need to be legit. What&#039;s more you&#039;re going to need a vendor who&#039;s stealth is proven to be impeccable. But bare in mind, once your vendor becomes compremised that you could potentially be your ass aswell.<br /><br />There&#039;s alot of things to consider. Are you prepared to do FEDERAL PRISON time for importing and distribution on a controlled substance and illegal use of your country&#039;s mail system? Just some shit to consider.

But he also had a fantastic business acumen and customer service style. His account was slightly comical due to you being sold drugs by Jesus which added a nice relaxed but professional edge to his vending account.<br /><br />I think what I&#039;m getting at is JOR created a character that maintained top quality products whilst delivering that customer service that we all may receive in normal life but crave in our drug purchases. So if any vendors of dealers replicate this style of selling and management of their operation I can say their much more likely to succeed in this games, however this is merely my opinion so take it with a pinch of salt!<br /><br />PlanB&nbsp; 8)

				A new dealer at the place I sell came up to me tonight and told me something along the lines of &quot;i dont mind you dealing here, but if you start cutting into my money, we&#039;ll need to talk&quot;. Haven&#039;t seen this guy ever except 2 times, and I&#039;ve been there for a few months now. How should I handle this..
