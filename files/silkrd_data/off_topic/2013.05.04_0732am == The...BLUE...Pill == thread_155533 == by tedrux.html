Take out a loan. Max out some credit cards. Pawn some shit you know you&#039;re not going to need in the after life. Or just find a sturdy piece of rope and a branch of pipe and position the rope so that it cuts off circulation from the carotid artery and jugular vein (if you make sure both are cut off, you won&#039;t experience any discomfort). People manage to kill themselves in prison with bedsheets, I think you could figure out how to do it in the free world.<br /><br />And how were you expecting to to pay for a &quot;blue pill&quot; without any money? I smell bullshit.

Hanging is the most reliable method of suicide second only to a shotgun to the head. In contrast, drug overdose is one of the LEAST reliable forms of suicide, though I personally don&#039;t see how ungodly amounts of illicit narcotics from the silk road to someone with no tolerance is gonna wind up being a 50/50 thing so long as you make sure you do it in a situation where you won&#039;t be caught.<br /><br />&quot;I expect it given to me for free.&quot; What kind of shitty self-entitled attitude is that? It&#039;s also dumb as hell and unnecessary. Why on earth would someone risk their freedom to give you a shitty pill for free for no fucking reason? I don&#039;t believe you don&#039;t have any money otherwise there&#039;s no way you&#039;d have internet access. If you do get a pill from someone, I hope it&#039;s filled with something particularly nasty and painful.

				Is this shit for real? Obviously not just a teenage come-down, as it&#039;s 5 days later and you asked for it again.<br /><br />No one on here will willingly, knowingly provide a drug that is used for the intention of suicide. Not for free, and not for any more. This place might be a &quot;black market&quot;, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a savage village of maniacs and terrorists who just want to kill and plunder.<br /><br />It&#039;s an online community of decent, for the most part honest, people who just want to spread love and make some money.<br /><br />You reckon the kind of people that distro MDMA and LSD are going to be able to live with the knowledge that they indirectly killed somebody? You overestimate the &quot;evil&#039; this place omits.<br /><br />Go find a bridge, or a cliff, jump off it. You want to experience bliss? With the enormous amount of G-Force and the in-borne genetic &quot;imminent death response&quot; of a long fall, you will feel like you&#039;re on 1000 hits of acid and 1000 grams of MDMA all at one go for what will seem like about 40-45 minutes. <br /><br />Take my word for it, the most immensely amazing way to die is from a fall. Maybe go skydiving and cut yourself from the tandem, or just find a really high cliff and go for gold.<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe me? Ask all the people who died from falls of 100+ feet. ...Oh wait

				this shit is indeed for real. I&#039;m possibly going to come into the money soon enough but don&#039;t have it right now. if there were a tall enough building or whatever around Id do that. as it is , for all my consideration, I think cyanide is the best option as long as I don&#039;t vomit (for which I guess some zofran would do). 5 days? tbh its been for the past 2 years mostly ive gotten any kind of serious about this, but even since I was 15 I was speculating about this day coming. it&#039;s almost time. i have some affairs to attend to,but its almost time. <br />and I dont think it savage to provide rest for the wicked. its mercy beyond the earthly of god (no comment or knowledge of the beyond, just beyond what god seems to offer during life). your veiw on civil differs depending who you ask.

				Are people seriously giving you coins for you to kill yourself? Cyanide is not very pleasant by the way.. I don&#039;t think anyone would be giving you a suicide pill for free. Doing that is just wrong.<br />Maybe you should buy some actual drugs on here so at least you can have some fun.. And you can make your own cyanide at home from legal materials. It doesn&#039;t seem so hard... There are a lot of poisons even easier to find out there. If you were that serious you would&#039;ve read about them and would be harvesting some plants by now / buying cyanide precursors.

				Well I think you should reconsider. Take LSD then you&#039;ll know the answer, or you won&#039;t... But at least you&#039;ll get high.<br />Either way it&#039;s just wrong to ask people to pay for your death. Making hydrogen sulfide is even easier but it&#039;s also not pleasant...
