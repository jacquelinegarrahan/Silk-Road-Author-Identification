				Hi all I just wanted to start a thread for not only us noobs but also to get know other members and sort of build an SR persona I know that vendors are weary of new users and I wanted to sort of get acclimated with the community...I want to start by saying, the SR creators deserve a Nobel Prize! I was overwhelmed when I finally made it to SR this is so beautiful! Safe, responsible, adult community enjoying in earths gifts! I also want to reassure other noobs to hang in there getting acclimated with SR is difficult for a reason you have to want it. The GPG and Bitcoin systems can be confusing and frustrating I know first hand, all the fuzzy warm feelings I was overwhelmed with upon reaching SR were replaced with rage trying to understand the site lol. But once again the beauty of this community prevailed the forums are extremely helpful and all your questions are answered if you seek them out. The forum is fantastic and I want to thank you all even though I know none of you. It only took a couple of days, now I have a general grasp on the mechanics of the site. The forum is a great place to read up on vendors before you decide the SR wiki explains this in detail to look into vendors on the forum because once again this wonderful community keep not only the vendors straight but the buyers as well...Ok I&#039;m done being all mushy lol...please if you have any advice or just want to chat feel free too I&#039;ve become addicted to these forums there is such a wealth of knowledge here and I&#039;m always on....THANKS SR and SR Forums

				Hi everyone.&nbsp; New user just wants to give thanks to DPR for setting up such a fantastic site!&nbsp; Appreciation also goes out to all the vendors, especially Lloydsbrothers who was patient during my first transaction.&nbsp; Finally a special thank you to Pine and all the others on the security thread who give up their time to help newcomers stay safe. Fuck all LE/Govs who thinks they have a right to impose their dubious morality or nanny state bullshit on others!<br /><br />Best<br /><br />Smith

				It seems like you are trying to start a thread for introductions?<br /><br />your words are kind, but honestly there is already an introduction thread that is stickied, so it would be best if you could just use that one please instead of making a new redundant thread<br /><br />its at the very top of this subforum off topic... <br /><br />thank you
