				A half a Xanax or 10MG Norco usually works best for me. However hydrocodone could make you go a little longer than you want, but will allow you to do some good sport fucking and your girl will probably like it&nbsp; :). The end result is worth it though- your toes will probably curl once you do nut considering it takes a bit long to get to.

Less if you buy bulk. 100 or so of that and you&#039;re set. I took some a while back, testing for a friend that I bought it for. I was walking around with a painfully hard erection for about an hour and a half, and spent the next 5 hours with a pretty juicy semi. It didn&#039;t drop off, even when I had orgasms.

				Tramadol.&nbsp; I used to have a script for it. When i was on that nothing could stop me. Everyone is different so i suppose you&#039;d have to experiment, but i&#039;d last longer on that compared to vicodin/percocet.&nbsp; d-amphetamine works too, but if you don&#039;t have it in your system regularly, you could run into trouble getting it up.&nbsp; A couple times in college adderall screwed me over in that regard! But i&#039;d get to the point where i couldn&#039;t cum if i were on adderall.<br /><br />Seriously, look into tramadol.&nbsp; Normally i go about 10-15 mins before im about to blow, I took tramadol and there was no end in sight.&nbsp; Stuff is addictive as hell just to warn you, be very careful. <br /><br />If you&#039;re really unsatisfied with how long you last, you should probably look into natural ways to correct this.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to have to rely on opiates and other drugs to have a normal sex life.&nbsp; Although i don&#039;t know which direction to point you in for a natural remedy, i&#039;m sure there&#039;s tons of info out there.&nbsp; Maybe start running/bicycle riding? I&#039;m sure getting regular cardio would probably help you out too....&nbsp;

				Well if you aren&#039;t opiate tolerant, you can try a low dose of hydrocodone. It usually makes it harder to reach orgasm while still allowing you to get it up and fuck in the first place. Then there&#039;s always viagra I guess, or higher doses of opiates.

				Look at the SSRIs section in silk road. Most SSRIs have the effect of making you lasting much longer. Don&#039;t overdo it though, or you might need more than two hours of frenzy fucking before you can reach orgasm. Besides it&#039;s a potent, long-term drug. But it works amazingly. Half a pill every day (starting one week before the day you want to rock) should be more than enough IMHO judging from your weight, and be a small enough dose to avoid getting addicted too fast (used paroxetine for several months and was able to stop overnight with no significant side-effect).<br /><br />First post here btw, hi everyone.

				There is a premature ejac drug that is legal overseas but the FDA is dragging their feet in America.&nbsp; Google it and you will find the name, Ive seen it on silk road form a vendor also. I was going to invest in the company but if the FDA doesn&#039;t have stake they will never let the drug get approved&nbsp; in the us and judging by the FDA&#039;s action on approving it, there not getting shit. <br /><br />Sorry for the rant but they will approve something that only hurts people so the fat cats get rich. Like that hormone that was in milk that caused cancer and the newscasters blew it up and got fired. There was no reason for it to be in mil except to make mofos rich.

				You could try to put something over your penis to help dull the sensation.&nbsp; Maybe just wrap it in some cellophane or put it in a sandwich bag, unless you&#039;re lucky enough to find something that&#039;s made specifically to go on a penis.

				Ya know there&#039;s always the old stop and start technique. You basically just stop fucking right before the feeling to cum starts. Wait a bit, but not too long to lose erection. Then start again and repeat the process til you before you cum. That way you get used to that cum urge and can control it better. And you can even practice this technique when jerking off. <br /><br />And the thing with using this technique be sure to tell the female you are fucking that you going to do it first. Or else she&#039;ll be, &quot;whats the fucks up with all this starting and stopping?&quot; lol. But hey some girls like a good long drawn out tease ride on the baloney pony, and can get into the starting and stopping, heh. Can drive &#039;em wild.

				I swear if you have a DXM trip the night before, the next day you will feel completely sober but you last forever.&nbsp; No problems keeping it up either.&nbsp; Stumbled upon this by accident actually.<br /><br />It is a cough suppressant, so my guess is it suppresses muscle contractions down there equally as well.

				As strange as it sounds eating oysters (canned too) have such a high concentration of zinc they can naturally increase the levels of serum testosterone in your body. Eat 1/2 can of oysters and you might not last as long but you will be able to pop a bunch off. At least you can try it out, maybe &quot;train&quot; with it first. It can also increase the amount of serum thyroid hormone as well so don&#039;t do it too late at night or you won&#039;t be able to sleep. Also... don&#039;t do it too frequently as excess zinc can fuck up your body (i.e. eating oysters every day for a year).

				Foreplay.<br /><br />Spend more time pleasuring her leading up to the event, if you do it well she&#039;ll come sooner and harder and more times during the actual intercourse.<br /><br />Any drug will have different effects depending on your own personal biochemistry and I wouldn&#039;t recommend trying different substances of questionable efficacy (and in some cases questionable safety) until you find some thing that works for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />I may be wrong but I think that natural is best, spend more time on her body and less on artificial solutions.

				I am not sure of your drug usage but SSRI&#039;s do work great for looooooooooongevity until climax. They take approx 1-3 weeks to start working and if you continue to stay on them then when you are done with them, you will need to taper off to avoid side effects. All the posts here are great and give you a variety of options. If you would like a long term natural fix then jerk off and fuck like a monkey (I had the same problem that you described and what I just suggested did not work for me). I use Zoloft 50 mg daily. (p.s. I have a lot of extra zoloft if you are interested) You may only need 12.5mg to 25mg daily taken in the am to do the job. Unfortunately, SSRI&#039;s do destroy you sex drive so adding mdma or something similar will do the trick. I have few questions: Is this a new girlfriend?, is she much hotter than the last. Does she like to do taboo sexual actions which you are not used to? Premature Ejaculation is Damn annoying and embarassing and there can me many factors that contribute.<br />p.s. as another member posted, try the sandwich bag, that would be freaking hilarious.<br />

				Finally, a forum topic that I know something about! And I am late enough to the party that you guys have covered it all, lol. Great all around drug advise for what works and what doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />As others have pointed out, nothing is better than simply becoming a better lover. If you are super quick then practice edging (stop-start) while solo. Learn how to interpret your own responses. Learn some basic breath control and breathing meditations. And hopefully have a sympathetic partner; then just tell her why you are stopping every 60 seconds.<br /><br />Now, lets say that you are &quot;only&quot; good for 15 minutes or so of playing hide the salami? Combine that with being scary good at oral and you are already a sex god compared to 99% of the guys that think they are good in bed.&nbsp; As others have pointed out, up the amount and creativity of four play by a bunch. Work on reading her reactions and be more of a tease in bed. Carry that over into oral. As in lots and lots and lots of oral. <br /><br />I promise you, if that is how you set the stage? No woman on the planet will complain if you switch BACK to oral and a bit of heavy four play every 15 minutes of intercourse. <br /><br />And please understand that watching porn is the absolute worst guide for how to please a woman. Most will become upset if you bring friends over to bone her, slap and spit on her, and insist on ass-to-mouth!

				I heard this on the radio once, and i swear it works!!<br /><br />right when u getting ready to cum, your balls kinda suck in a little.<br />If you reach down and pull down on them, and stretch them out a little, its almost like a restart button. and you almost get a do over.<br /><br />I know it sounds stupid. but i swear it works! try it and report back.<br /><br />But it only works once per session. you cant do it twice in a row.

				Haha, this post made me smile and I can&#039;t resist weighing in with a girl&#039;s perspective.<br /><br />I&#039;d forget about the drugs, seriously! Do you really want to give her a mind blowing orgasm one night because of drugs and then the next night think she&#039;s going to be disappointed because you don&#039;t have any? <br /><br />Just work on it together - foreplay more, and do the stop start thing that the guys above said. It really doesn&#039;t matter as long as you carry on doing something else while you&#039;re stopped (like, er, rubbing something...). Frankly, the more rubbing the better, in my opinion.<br /><br />And try different positions...if you&#039;ve got to concentrate on some form of balancing as well as performance you&#039;ll last longer!<br /><br />God, now I&#039;m just over sharing...fuck...<br /><br />PS.
