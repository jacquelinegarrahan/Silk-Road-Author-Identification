				Hey I was wondering if any one could offer any experience dealing with mans best friend turned FACIST HELL HOUND? I don&#039;t need bull shit stories and garbage that doesn&#039;t work (there is clearnet for that). Basically I travel for work and am gone for like 2 months at a time. I carried some brownies with me once with no issue. I only hit a check point when in south texas its the only GODDAMN one and I always have like a 1 out 4 chance a month of hitting it. I&#039;m not wanting to carry straight up bud, just maybe some edibles or tincture. I&#039;m wondering what would be easiest to keep and conceal. I saw the vendor Solid Rain is selling tincture that is nicely concealed in a pen like casing with cap and everything. I&#039;m wondering would this be easy to conceal and could the dogs smell it?

				Been through the one near brownsville coming back north. That checkpoint kinda sneaks up on you.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t even have any drugs in the car, didn&#039;t even mess with them back then.&nbsp; The dogs hit on the car and they said if we had anything under a quarter ounce, they will take it and let us on our way, otherwise, if we refuse and the dogs find it, we are in trouble.&nbsp; Needless to say, they made us pull out of line and let the dog go through the car, jump in the trunk, etc.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t find anything, but it wasn&#039;t cool at all. <br /><br />Be careful.&nbsp; &nbsp;They even say dogs are trained to smell things used to conceal the bud...peanut butter, coffee, etc.&nbsp;

				the single best and only way to transport any amount of any marijuana IMO is vacuum sealing it. they sell cheap ones that work just fine for under 60$ at walmart or target. a fair price to pay for your freedom. if you do not have one or means or access to one than im sorry i can not help, lol. if you do then heres what u do seal up your stuff once, then take it to another location with out any bud present or just was that nag good with soap then some rubbing alch. then your hands and seal it up again.. the idea is to not have anything that was in contact direct or indirect with the pot making contact of any kind with the bag you will be transporting. the dogs will smell the residual scent from your fingers on the bag. hope i was of assistance<br />. good luck!

				Wait wait. What? Excuse me for being naive, but the fuck? Lemme get this straight - in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, cops can just STOP you anywhere they want and search your car? The motherfuck? I didn&#039;t realize that the USA turned into Syria. <br /><br />Again, I&#039;m not entirely familiar with Constitutional rights, but don&#039;t you have the right to refuse a search and seizure? They just have checkpoints with fucking dogs and can stop whomever the fuck they want?&nbsp; Is this a border crossing or random checkpoint? Border crossing would make sense. <br /><br />I dunno, but I&#039;m damn fucking glad I live in Canada. Say what you want, but this ain&#039;t no fascist regime...

				I can speak for Canada as well I go up there all the time mostly Ontario but also Alberta and BC every now and then....your right no road side check points and customs doesn&#039;t go on a tangent and search you inside and out. America is becoming more and more unfamiliar every day. It can be exaggerated, its not to the point of Syria yet but it definitely could lead to that with all the tyrannical laws that get passed everyday while everyone is watching jersey shore and surfing amazon for shit they can&#039;t afford nor need. When you come back into America, your own country, from Canada your considered an terrorist. You have no constitutional rights in between borders, All your personal possessions can be searched and confiscated with out any probable cause what so every. Laptops, cell phones, cameras, and anything else holding personal data with out notice can be taken and investigated and they don&#039;t have to give it back. I was detained by customs passing through a year ago. They just randomly decided to search me. They had me wait in a small white room, I wasn&#039;t aloud to use the bathroom or my phone to let any one know I was detained. They ransacked my vehicle, when I got back my shit was thrown all over the place they didn&#039;t care. It took my close to 45 min to clean up every thing. There are still parts of America you can still be free, hopefully the rest of the country will wake up and string these trolls up and finally rid our country of fascism.....
