				my dealers buddy randomly came back from cali with 40lbs of some decent &quot;cali dro&quot;&nbsp; just outdoor grown by the tons lol. No special look but didnt look shitty af and no seeds were found.. Good buds. I bought for 1500.. my dude prolly paid 12 or 11.. So the dude who drove them paid like 600 for 50+?&nbsp; HOW do you find these ppl lol. I spend tons of $$ on this site and just realized how much $$ that he is making off some ok bud from a dude he met in cali... I know im prolly gonna get -karma and shit but just curious.. only place ik to ask a question like that..

				It&#039;s cheap in northern Cali.&nbsp; Get to know the growers in Humboldt, Redding, Eureka, Ukiah Mendocino area.&nbsp; Go to the medical marijuana meetups.&nbsp; All the people I know of charge $1,000 to $2,400 for quality pounds out there.&nbsp; $2,400 being for original GDP right from the tall ass man who invented the strain himself.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tight knit community of growers.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t get cheaper if you buy higher quantity than a pound from what I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; If it&#039;s a thousand a pound then its 40 thousand for 40 pounds.&nbsp; At least that&#039;s how it is with all the growers I know out there.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty common for growers to carpool from northern Cali down to San Fran to go ship out packages.&nbsp; San Fran isn&#039;t a weedy area like northern Cali and there are soooo many shipping points :)
