				Get the bbq on, pull out a deck chair, make sure the beers are topped up in the fridge, preroll a few joints and your good to go :)<br />Least thats what im doing this weekend, but yeah its bloody hot here atm.<br />Better enjoy it while we can since it will probably piss it down for weeks again after these few nice days were getting.

				what kind of wine did you bust out?<br /><br />IMO, portuguese green wine, or &quot;vinho verde&quot; is best on hot days....served as cold as you can possibly chill it to.<br /><br />sounds like you need to buy an air conditioner tho.&nbsp; its totally worth it

				You think that&#039;s bad? Please, it&#039;s nearly at a constant 43 degrees here and it&#039;s monsoon season so it&#039;s also humid as fuck. We&#039;re basically stuck indoors until night but my state has some of the worst drivers in the United States and nearly everyone&#039;s drinking after 8pm so I hardly bother going out at night even other than house parties. :-X
