				Y&#039;all heard about this? This teacher in LA bound and gagged over 20 students and forced them to eat spoonfuls of his semen. He took pictures of it too. All of the kids 10 years old and younger. This world is fucked up.<br /><br />http://www.chron.com/news/article/LA-teacher-due-in-court-on-molestation-charges-2899398.php

				I just read the article in the LA Times.&nbsp; DISTURBING and SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP.&nbsp; &nbsp;What&#039;s even more fucked up is the cops knew he was doing this and during the investigation THEY LET HIM CONTINUE SPOON FEEDING SEMEN TO SCHOOLCHILDREN&nbsp; to get coveted DNA evidence to virtually secure a conviction.&nbsp; &nbsp;THAT IS A CRIME THAT IS ALMOST AS BAD AS WHAT HE WAS DOING...ok not really but you know what I&#039;m saying.&nbsp; &nbsp; WHAT THE FUCK?

				SICK. It&#039;s really disgusting what people do to each other. The police really didn&#039;t handle it right. The confessions of several children really wasn&#039;t enough?

				I&#039;ve lost all faith in humanity. Except the people I know and you guys, most of you guys and most of the people I know are pretty cool. But somewhere out there are tons of humanity that just doesn&#039;t deserve to be called that.

				Sometimes I really wish I believed in some for of Karma or Divine Justice. But frankly, an eternity sucking Hitler&#039;s dick in hell while being butt-raped by a horny T-Rex with splinters on its dick seems to me like it&#039;d still be going easy on this asshole.
