				theres this stuff called fluoride that is in practically all drinking water, bottled or not. it is a poison that the government says is used to protect teeth, yet it only has an effect on your teeth when used topically, IE touching your teeth. so when you swallow it, it has no effect on your teeth. chances are, youve been swallowing it ever since you were a baby if you live in the US. and if&nbsp; you have been for that long, youve ingested way more than is naturally healthy. your body absorbs up to 90% of it when you are young. and it is toxic, and likely has destroyed part of your brain. the nazis used in in concentration camps on the jews to make them docile and stupid. its not proven that it has this affect, but its effects on the brain have never been researched [to the publics knowledge] by our government. even if it doesnt effect your brain it is still a poison that accumulates in your body, and its in almost everything you eat and drink. you need to get a expensive water filter or drink expensive water to avoid drinking it, and avoiding eating it is a different matter that i have yet to learn. i know a drug forum isnt the best place to preach about substances that negatively affect the brain, but this is happening on a mass scale and the government is [are?] the ones behind it. i beg you to please drink smart water, it has no fluoride, and research it until you can come to a conclusion for yourself. this is a good place to start: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation&nbsp; &nbsp;and google is your friend [except when the use your IP address to spy on you, so make sure you use TOR to browse]

				<br /><br />Key Findings - Fluoride &amp; the Brain: (Click for more detail)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />1) Fluoride&#039;s ability to damage the brain represents one of the most active areas of research on fluoride toxicity today.<br />&nbsp;<br />2) The research on fluoride and the brain has been fueled by 18 human studies from China, India, Iran, and Mexico finding elevated levels of fluoride exposure to be associated with IQ deficits in children. Fluoride&#039;s impact on IQ is exacerbated among children with low-iodine exposure.<br />&nbsp;<br />3) The impact of fluoride on children&#039;s IQ has been documented even after controlling for children&#039;s lead exposure, iodine exposure, parental education and income status, and other known factors that might impact the results (Rocha-Amador 2007; Xiang 2003 a,b).<br />&nbsp;<br />4) In addition to IQ studies, 3 studies (Yu 1996; Du 1992; Han 1989) have found that fluoride accumulates in the brain of the fetus, causing damage to cells and neurotransmitters and 1 study (Li 2004) has found a correlation between exposure to fluoride during fetal development and behavioral deficits among neonates.<br />&nbsp;<br />5) Several recent studies have found that even adult exposures to fluoride may result in central nervous system disturbances, particularly among industrial workers.<br />&nbsp;<br />5) The findings of neurological effects in fluoride-exposed humans is consistent with, and strengthened by, recent findings from over 40 animal studies published since 1992. As with the studies on humans, the studies on animals have reported an impairment in learning and memory prorcesses among the fluoride-treated groups.<br />&nbsp;<br />6) The animal studies have also documented considerable evidence of direct toxic effects of fluoride on brain tissue, even at levels as low as 1 ppm fluoride in water (Varner 1998). These effects include:<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />-- reduction in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors;<br />&nbsp;-- reduction in lipid content;<br />&nbsp;-- impaired anti-oxidant defense systems;<br />&nbsp;-- damage to the hippocampus;<br />&nbsp;-- damage to the purkinje cells; <br />-- increased uptake of aluminum; <br />-- formation of beta-amyloid plaques (the classic brain abnormality in Alzheimer&#039;s disease); <br />-- exacerbation of lesions induced by iodine deficiency; and <br />-- accumulation of fluoride in the pineal gland.<br /><br />http://www.fluoridealert.org/health/brain/

				Pretty spot on. One small correction: ingested fluoride does affect your teeth, because after entering your blood it accumulates in calcifying tissues, particularly the pineal gland, but also bones and teeth, where it weakens their structure and promotes osteoperosis.

				Related to helping the body cope with the massive amount of poison coming from all directions:<br /><br />This is a 2000+ yr old technique (ayurvedic medicine) to keep your mouth clean, very simple yet incredibly effective: coconutresearchcenter.org/article%20oil%20pulling.htm<br /><br />The basic idea is, if the mouth is kept very clean, the immune system will have more energy to work on healing other areas of your body. In my experience, trying this myself and with friends and family - it works well.<br /><br />Take a spoonful of coconut oil, swish it around your mouth for 20 mins (start lower if it&#039;s hard at first, to hold this long) - then spit it all out. Do it before breakfast each day. If you are sick, do it before each meal (3x per day).

Fluoride had been used to separate the uranium isotopes (U-235 becomes a gas when 6 fluorides are attached to it) that were used to make the atomic bomb, and once that whole thing were over the Atomic Energy Commission was left with thousands of tons of hexasillicofluoride. In collaboration with lawyers from the Aluminium Corporation of America, the other major producer of fluoride wastes, a campaign was begun to convince the public (and specifically the dentists) that fluoride should be added to water supplies to prevent tooth decay. The people responsible may have known of its neurotoxic effects, but I think that would have been at most a secondary reason for instituting mass fluoridation. Its function is primarily waste removal; toxic waste that ALCOA would have had to dispose of expensively or dump into the environment (risking lawsuits) could now be sold at a profit to municipal water supplies; &quot;for only a few cents per person per year you can reduce the risk of tooth decay!&quot;.

				FUCK FLUORIDE! <br /><br />The thing that makes me really bummed is that it is in baby water and you usually find water bottle packs for the little kids with the oddly shaped plastic bottle designed for the kids so they can be like mommy i want this one but the thing is i see those at the local supermarket labeled with this &quot;Now with Extra Fluoride&quot; and they have all these photos of little ones playing soccer and other attractive kid images. Oh the anger this brings to me,,, how do they even sleep at night?<br /><br /><br />The other thing is fluoride works as a slow poison in the human body from what i have read. it also builds a calcium barrier on your pineal glad which is most disturbing to me. I had a friend who had been ingesting lots of fluoride unknowingly and it took him 3 separate occasions to blast off on dmt. it just wouldn&#039;t hit him... Any thoughts on this?&nbsp; It was dank dmt. <br /><br /><br />If you want to avoid fluoride in your water make sure to buy the water that has gone through &quot;Reverse osmosis filtration&quot; that removes all fluoride apparently but how do we know we can trust the label ehh?<br /><br />

				BTW&nbsp; What most people are not aware of as well; you will absorb more fucked up additives and toxins (ie. chlorine, fluoride,&nbsp; etc) through your skin in a 15 minute shower than if you were to drink your 8 glasses of tap water all day!<br /><br />NCK
