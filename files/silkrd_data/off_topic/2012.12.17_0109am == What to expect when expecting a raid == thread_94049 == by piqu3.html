The thing you should be concerned about is data retention on the part of the cell phone carrier.&nbsp; If you are the subject of an investigation, it is almost certain that a preservation order will have been applied for -- this will cover: <br /><br />1) Call history -- the telco will likely have a record of every number you&#039;ve called (and every number that has called you) with that phone in the last several months to a year or more (if not two);&nbsp; and <br /><br />2) Text message history -- the authorities may have requested the carrier to retain copies of all text messages sent/received to your phone number in the last year or two. <br /><br />3) The telco may have data on file regarding the location of the phone; this is usually obtained through cell tower triangulation or GPS data; this may help map your movements over a period of time. (This data may also be subject to a&nbsp; preservation order.) <br /><br />4) If your case is deemed important enough, they may even have arranged for a wiretap on your phone.&nbsp; If that is the case, then likely recordings exist of you talking business on the phone. <br /><br />The only way all of this can be&nbsp; avoided is by not using a cellphone for business in the first place. <br /><br />Another problem you may have is that this telco data may be used to map out a network of your business associates. If any of them have not been as careful in cleaning house, etc. then they may find themselves busted.&nbsp; What happens if they are offered a deal to roll over on you? That alone may be enough to earn you some jail time, even in the absence of hard evidence against you personally. <br /><br />The best advice I can give you is: lawyer-up -- you&#039;re likely to need one. <br /><br />NC<br />

				What other methods would you use to contact and arrange somewhere to meet if you don&#039;t have a phone? (serious question, i&#039;d like to hear any alternatives you have)

				Thanks for the response Nightcrawler, pretty much confirmed my fears. Hope to have some time tomorrow to discretely shop for lawers. Also, I do no business online, just coming here for advice.

				So when someone want&#039;s to buy a quarter of weed off you (in real life), you want me to tell them to PGP encrypt their request in an Internet cafe?<br /><br />These are potheads trying to get their weed off a dealer.&nbsp; I doubt any of them know what PGP even is led alone go to the time to communicate with a drug dealer through it.&nbsp; Most of them would just die laughing.&nbsp; That just isn&#039;t how dealing works ... well at least not anywhere i&#039;ve ever seen in my life ... ppl want their weed for the night, and want to either have it delivered to them, or walk to the dealers house to make a quick transaction and go on about their business ... not learn PGP lol.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t see how anything but a phone would be an acceptable means of doing business.

				I suppose a Ham Radio is out of the question then.<br /><br />&nbsp;:P<br /><br /><br />I saw a listing a week back for a mobile phone with a zero&#039;d EIMI, or whatever it&#039;s abbreviated to, supposed to be untraceable after sim card changes, apparently the cops cant even tell what kind of phone it is, specific model info, that stuff.

After Symantec acquired PGP, Inc. in June 2010, Phil lost the hosting for his project, which had been provided by PGP, Inc. <br /><br />PGP, Inc. had their site setup so as to comply with U.S. export regulations; remember Phil had been put&nbsp; through the wringer for 3 years by U.S. Customs, who suspected him of violating U.S. export laws. Needless to say, he didn&#039;t want to go&nbsp; through that again. Phil apparently didn&#039;t have the money to setup another secure server, so essentially the project is abandoned. (One can still find the software on the Net if you know where to look.) <br /><br />Phil has now started his own subscription service, known as Silent Circle. <br /><br />The ZRTP protocol, which served as the heart of Zfone, is also available in a software package known as Jitsi (formerly known as SIP Communicator).&nbsp; This is the software recommended by Jacob Appelbaum, one of the Tor developers. <br /><br />One thing you must bear in mind is that Zfone/Jitsi is for _privacy_ -- it provides NO anonymity.&nbsp; Using either software, both of the endpoints are known and/or discoverable.&nbsp; The IM/voice traffic will be encrypted, but it will be obvious to the authorities that you and another party are communicating.&nbsp; As such, traffic analysis can still be used to build up a map (or network) of one&#039;s associates. <br /><br />Finally, both parties communicating must have a copy of this software installed for it to work; this is highly unlikely to be the case if you&#039;re dealing with run of the mill buyers, most of whom would be as security-conscious as a stone. <br /><br />NC<br /><br /><br />
