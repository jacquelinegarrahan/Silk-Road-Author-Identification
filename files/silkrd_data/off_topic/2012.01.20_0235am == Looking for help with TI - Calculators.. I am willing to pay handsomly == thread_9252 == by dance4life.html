				I am looking for any possible way to make a TI-89 Calculator look like a TI-8x ( anything lower than 89 )<br /><br />The most likely way to do this would be to take off the cover and make &quot;adjustments&quot; to make it look like a different one.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.. probably impossible but I am willing to pay up to $300 if you can show me a working model.&nbsp; Or if you have other suggestions I am willing to listen.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				hehe , i take it you have a calculus test or something and arent supposed to use the differentiate and integrate functions or something?<br /><br />well i would think the only way to do that would be to buy two calcs, and actually switch out the innards,&nbsp; in theory it should work, id imagine you would have to be kinda competent with a soldering iron etc... and be sure to tag all the lines so you can remember where they go back, it may work, or you may be out 240 bucks :p

				Exactly.&nbsp; I am not so competent in these things.&nbsp; Although I am sure there are some that are capable and perhaps have already done this same exact thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I need to be able to manipulate equations and it is basically not possible with the lower TI models AFAIK.

				I dont know.. probably ASAP.&nbsp; I have a TI-89 myself already that I would be willing to send so you don&#039;t have to purchase one yourself.&nbsp; Let me know if you can make the modifications etc and we can go from there.&nbsp; I am sure someone has actually done this before but aren&#039;t advertising.<br /><br />I will probably have to purchase a TI-84+ in the meantime for class ( which is going to kill me ).&nbsp; I hate the lower model TI&#039;s..

				I work in electrical engineering. You would have to pay me more like $7,500 to do something like this.<br /><br />Generally, projects like this are done out of labors of love. You will never find somebody willing it to do it at your cost and timeframe.

				How about ten 20mg adderall&#039;s and a high five?&nbsp; I mean you don&#039;t have to have a masters degree to take the case apart and make it look nice.

				LOL, that much amphetamine and I&#039;d be looking to fuck, not do pcb redesign. I am ofc assuming that the calculators are structurally different though. Haven&#039;t used a calculator irl in forever...
