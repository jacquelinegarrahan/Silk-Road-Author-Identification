				Hello new friends, I have a few questions here:<br /><br />What are the chances of a controlled delivery for a spore syringe?<br />They are controlled in Cali and 2 other states.<br /><br />I am thinking or ordering a syringe to start growing them myself, I have the growing materials, except for the syringes.<br /><br />Can somebody who has done this before tell me about it?<br />Like, what is the penalty for getting caught growing personal amounts?<br />etc---<br /><br /><br />Looking forward to what surfaces on here--

				Most spores vendors ship them very discreetly and it&#039;s not like dogs can sniff out a spore, I would bet $ that if you order one it will arrive no problems&nbsp; &nbsp;:)
