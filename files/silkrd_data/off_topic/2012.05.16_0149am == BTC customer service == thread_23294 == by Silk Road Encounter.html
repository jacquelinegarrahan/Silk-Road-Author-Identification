				Does Mt Gox or any btc exchange offer customer service?&nbsp; Is there anyone here that can help me turn my cash into btc and btc into cash?&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in moneypaks.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in cash at the bank or some method where I only deal with reputable exchanges.

				Lol that would be wonderful, but I have yet to find USD customer service, I swear my dollar has been getting smaller and smaller you know what I am saying&nbsp; :)<br /><br />As for Mt. Gox, they are in Japan, and are SLOW but get to you. For now I either pay a 10%+$6 for BTCKing on the SR, or go Dowalla to Mt Gox then to SR. <br /><br />As of yet, no simple route. Limitless I think has it figured out, but his services are not cheap, but I would think worth it.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend any &quot;over the counter&quot; solution for financial liquidation.<br /><br />Your best bet is a reputable website with a reputation to loose in order to assure fast and accurate service. There are a few out there that might be up for the job however it is important to be selective when choosing one of these services as many have had a problem with hackers and other btc related theft.

				get-bitcoin.com is pretty professional I emailed them a few times about my order. Although I had to wait a few extra days because my parcel required a signature and apparently it takes longer to get to them if it has a signature confirmation.

				For cash into BTC the absolute best way to go is Bit-Instant (i.e. deposit cash with an invoice number at specific major banks) and they send you BTC at your Mt Gox account or at your account at other exchanges. Processing time is a few hours at most. VERY FAST.<br /><br />Taking money out is trickier. If it&#039;s small amounts obfuscate and tumble your BTC *****thoroughly***** then cash out through a wire transfer from an exchange to a bank account.<br /><br />Don&#039;t ever deal with exchangers here on the Road. It&#039;s an out of escrow transaction (you know that whole NO FE STAY IN ESCROW mantra everyone keeps screaming??) and you are almost certainly going to get screwed over at some point.
