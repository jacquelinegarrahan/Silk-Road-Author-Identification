				I just had an awesome dream of epoch proportions.<br />I dreamt that I &quot;found&quot; a bunch of acid in my stash and ate it.<br />I then proceeded to have one of the most amazing and wonderful trips of my life.<br />It FELT REAL!<br />No kidding.&nbsp; I was tripping balls in my sleep, and it was ecstasy.<br />I only woke up when my wife got home and woke me.<br />I&#039;m basking in the afterglow right now of this amazing dream.<br /><br />WOOOOHOOO!&nbsp; The mind is an amazing thing!

				Wow thats pretty crazy. Interesting you feel an afterglow from being woken out of the trip. I wonder if your neural activity was actually resembling that of a trip... Whats even cooler is you saved like ten bucks.<br /><br />Maybe in some other dimension youre tripping right now.

				Tell me about it, I&#039;m still feeling energized today.&nbsp; VERY uplifting!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I have never had a dream this profound before.&nbsp; Maybe a midnight flashback?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been one to believe in flashbacks, I always figured that L changes you, and you get used to that state of being over time... like when you sit in a hot bath.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are dimensions out there where I am eating crystal.&nbsp; LOL
