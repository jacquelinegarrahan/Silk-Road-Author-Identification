				So I woke up to go to a dentist appointment this morning. I did not eat but I drank like a liter of some what seems to be high acid apple juice..<br /><br />Now I cant eat for 2 hours and my stomach is ripping up inside because all this acid is eating away at me!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;Think its ok to eat after a fluoride and cleaning?? or do I really need to wait.... I dont think I can!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\

				just don&#039;t eat red,brown or blue based foods as they will stay in the soft flouride gel and stain it till your next visit which would be soon if you eat Blueberries

				Can&#039;t you just take an antacid to neutralize the burning?

				Well thank god I did not eat any blueberries... I did however tear apart little pieces of bread and tossed them down my throat to suck up some of that fucking applejuice... I felt like a friggen seagull but I had to do what I had to do..... It was unbearable... and maybe an antacid would have worked but I think that&#039;s more for your chest on heart style... like for heart burn... I had acid stomach burn...It sucked but its gone now and I can eat again...<br /><br />At least now I know never stop at the dep on the way to the dentist and buy a liter of AJ without something to eat!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				BigBill has given you some good advice. I think you should stick to alkaline foods for a little while, almonds, cucumbers, broccoli, spinach and yoghurt (the natural live variety) lower your body&#039;s pH level by reducing the amount of acid. Bananas, coconuts and raisins, are alkalinic foods that maintain your bodies pH levels. Be careful of butter, cheese, citrus fruits, fried and fatty foods, and meat, as they are high in acid and raise your body&#039;s acidity levels. I don&#039;t know where in the world you are, but when I was in Canada, there was a brand called Allens that did a low acid AJ (if you must!). Sounds like your on the road to recovery now, but an alkaline diet might help you feel even better. I&#039;ve suffered with excess stomach acid in the past and it&#039;s an awful feeling, I can really sympathize with you&nbsp; :)
