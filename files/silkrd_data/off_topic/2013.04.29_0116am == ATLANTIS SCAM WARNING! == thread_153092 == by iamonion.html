				Dear all SR users,<br /><br />I have seen some disturbing evidence about Atlantis Marketplace.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Vladimir is a known scammer here on SR.&nbsp; He ran a ponzi scheme and stole a lot of coin.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t believe me, do a quick search of his name.<br />2.&nbsp; The moderators at AM are deleting user comments!&nbsp; Read again, the moderators at AM are deleting user comments!!!&nbsp; This screams suspect as fuck.<br />3.&nbsp; The alias Vladimir is tied to a known identity.&nbsp; That is, Vladimir has been identified!<br />4.&nbsp; Vladimir is known to have strong ties with Limitless.<br /><br />If I do recall, Vlad is also known to having ties with another huge SR scammer that offered laundering information among other things.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the name, but feel free to comment here if you have it.<br /><br />If this Vladimir is the same Vlad that used to frequent this site, then it is awfully fucking arrogant of him to pull such a large scam then use the funds to make a site dedicated to over running SR.&nbsp; That is right, it is possible that the stolen money from this site is being used to find the development of AM.<br /><br />It is also awfully fucking odd that SR is getting attacked with the DDoS for months leading up to the creation of AM.&nbsp; I suspect that AM was in development by these shady fucks when SR initially began getting the DDoS.&nbsp; It only makes sense that AM would be sure to show that SR is not stable for a few months leading up to the creation of AM.&nbsp; It also makes sense that AM was able to secure this continuous DDoS attack by using the funds scammed here on SR.<br /><br />Please do not do business on AM.<br /><br />It is run by a known scammer.<br />The mods are deleting critical forum posts and censoring the community (stinks of fucking scammers.)<br />The integrated encryption IS NOT SAFE AT ALL.<br /><br />To you fellows who plan to frequent those forums, please keep a look out for boisterous and flamboyant &quot;big players&quot; in the scene.&nbsp; Pay special attention to those who have a tendency to type like they are English.&nbsp; This will most likely be Limitless.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be surprised if Limitless shows up as a key player in the marketplace.<br /><br />I URGE YOU ALL TO PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE REVIEW THE IDENTITIES OF VLADIMIR AND ANY OTHER KEY PLAYER AND MAKE ONLY HIGHLY INFORMED DECISIONS.<br /><br />Just because SR has done you well so far, doesn&#039;t mean it is time to get complacent and get caught the fuck up.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Onion.<br /><br />

				His known alias on sr is the same as his current alias.<br /><br />He has gone by Vladimir since day one on SR.&nbsp; He went by Vladimir on clearnet, even going so far as to use the same forum image (up close Guy Fawkes).&nbsp; This is how his identity was discovered.<br /><br />I am doing schoolwork so I don&#039;t have too much time to dig around the forums, but his foolish use of the alias and image led to the discovery of his &quot;true&quot; identity.&nbsp; Could it have been the wrong person?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; These forum posts may have been deleted by mods for their inclusion of known identities.<br /><br />Please make informed decisions SR users!

				The Vladimir over here was &quot;Vlad1m1r&quot; and I must admit he made some pretty newb mistakes. Either he got busted or he turned scammer, one of those. In any case I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any evidence their &quot;Vladimir&quot; is the same person.<br /><br />If it is, then Atlantis are sort of seriously fucked lol. This was a guy who did CIM as a BTC exchanger for SR, and didn&#039;t wear gloves. He talked a good game, but didn&#039;t really do his research or have an actual, you know, plan. If this is the same Vlad, that won&#039;t have changed.<br /><br />As for Limetless, does he know you&#039;re saying he&#039;s jumped ship? I&#039;ve PMed him so we&#039;ll see what he has to say about that.<br /><br />I must admit though, some things about Atlantis are seriously weird.<br /><br />Take this for example, it&#039;s their forum registration bullshit you have to sign before joining up:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Registration Agreement<br /><br />You agree, through your use of this forum, that you will not post any material which is false, defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person&#039;s privacy, adult material, or otherwise in violation of any International or United States Federal law.

But that does not include DOS on your competitors. The admins of Atlantis should make a statement about whether they are involved in that or not instead of sitting there preening themselves with their sockpuppets and astroturfed marketplace vendors. They should do so out of their own interest, otherwise this DOS could be a DEA ploy to get the two marketplaces to clash and begin a hackerwar for no reason.<br /><br />SR and BlackMarketReloaded have been competing for ages, backopy and DPR don&#039;t have issues with each other, just mutual respect, so competition isn&#039;t the issue. Being a bunch of jerks, is. Atlantis certainly have not endeared themselves to me and I strongly get the sour grapes vibe after visiting their forum recently. That is what I don&#039;t understand, because there&#039;s infinitely more marketplace to go around by breaking into the traditional black market in RL, get those people on board. I can&#039;t understand why they even think SR is the main competition. They carp about how they are only in it for the money, but I&#039;m not seeing them do anything other than attempt to poach SR customers, which is lame. Everybody should be working on cracking open the IOP market, the bitcoin OTC market, and the multi-billion dollar trade known as the RL black market.

However, I&#039;m not convinced that program can be used in a manner which can decrypt PGP messages without having immediate access to the host system. Keep in mind the software mentioned requires that an attack be performed in order to get access to the users encryption keys. In order to initiate this attack, the forensic analyst must do one of the following:<br /><br />1. Analyze the hibernation file on the host system. A web-server wouldn&#039;t have access to this file and even if it did, it is several gigabytes in size and would take forever to upload to the web-server in order to be analyzed.<br />2. Access to a memory dump file. This file is much smaller but once again, unless your system is infected with a virus, a web-server won&#039;t be able to gain access to these dump files.<br />3. A Firewire attack. This requires LOCAL hardware access to the suspects computer. (The encrypted volume MUST already be mounted, otherwise this attack won&#039;t work)<br /><br />I&#039;m very familiar with computer security and I&#039;m unaware of any PGP attack that can be used on a remote server. Even with local access, the above attack will only work IF the encryption keys have been stored in the hibernation file or memory dump files. In fact: If you&#039;re smart you&#039;re using Linux on a bootable USB key which means you effectively eliminate this type of attack.

				Before I knew about SR I used to order drugs off a similar but lesser known service which also had a customer forum.&nbsp; The trouble with their forum was that it was moderated by people who were clearly on some sort of online power trip, as they had ridiculously tight rules on what you could post and basically anything perceived as remotely critical or discussion about emerging competitors would get your posts removed and the mods would immediately threaten a ban in a very rude and immature way.&nbsp; The way they ran their forum pissed me off to the point of just going back to street buying for a year or so, that is until I found SR in late 2011.

If Atlantis is a DEA honeypot, then even if you use PGP when transferring your personal information, they could still be saving and decrypting every single one of your messages.<br /><br />I believe that Atlantis is a DEA honeypot and that the DDOS attacks are being made in order to drive users to Atlantis, where the DEA will have access to all of their communications due to the fact that they can crack your PGP.<br /><br />http://www.elcomsoft.com/efdd.html<br /><br />That&#039;s the software. If you put in an order over Atlantis, then they can store your PGP message and decrypt it at their leisure using this software.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Looking at the description for that decryption product, if I understand correctly, it appears to need the entire hard drive to unencrypt. I don&#039;t think they can take just a PGP-encrytped message by itself and unencrypt it with that software:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Three Ways to Acquire Encryption Keys<br /><br />Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor needs the original encryption keys in order to access protected information stored in crypto containers. The encryption keys can be derived from hibernation files or memory dump files acquired while the encrypted volume was mounted. There are three ways available to acquire the original encryption keys:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; By analyzing the hibernation file (if the PC being analyzed is turned off);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; By analyzing a memory dump file *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; By performing a FireWire attack ** (PC being analyzed must be running with encrypted volumes mounted).<br /><br />* A memory dump of a running PC can be acquired with one of the readily available forensic tools such as MoonSols Windows Memory Toolkit<br />** A free tool launched on investigator’s PC is required to perform the FireWire attack (e.g. Inception)<br />Acquiring Encryption Keys<br /><br />Generally, the choice of one of the three attacks depends on the running state of the PC being analyzed. It also depends on whether or not installation of a forensic tool is possible on a PC under investigation.<br /><br />If the PC being investigated is turned off, the encryption keys can be retrieved from the hibernation file. The encrypted volume must be mounted before the computer went to sleep. If the volume is dismounted before hibernation, the encryption keys may not be derived from the hibernation file.<br /><br />If the PC is turned on, a memory dump can be taken with any forensic tool if installation of such tool is permitted (e.g. the PC is unlocked and logged-in account has administrative privileges). The encrypted volume must be mounted at the time of memory dump acquisition. Good description of this technology (and complete list of free and commercial memory acquisition tools) is available at http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Tools:Memory_Imaging.<br /><br />Finally, if the PC being investigated is turned on but installing forensic tools is not possible (e.g. the PC is locked or logged-in account lacks administrative privileges), a remote attack via a FireWire port can be performed in order to obtain a memory dump. This attack requires the use of a free third-party tool (such as Inception: http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/), and offers near 100% results due to the implementation of FireWire protocol that enables direct memory access. Both the target PC and the computer used for acquisition must have FireWire (IEEE 1394) ports.<br /><br />Once the original encryption keys are acquired, Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor stores the keys for future access, and offers an option to either decrypt the entire content of encrypted container or mount the protected disk as another drive letter for real-time access.&quot;<br /><br />See they need access to the hard drive of the machine that was used to create the key.<br /><br />Or am I wrong? I could be wrong.

				Well, if my spewing of nonsense creates sensible debate about the topic then the desired outcome has been achieved.&nbsp; My accusations cause no harm to the community and only serve to open, sometimes heated, discussion.&nbsp; If supporting evidence is given to defeat or uphold the accusation then the forum participants are being given the option to draw their own conclusions, which ultimately benefits the community.<br /><br />I may spit garbage every once in a while, but at least I do not continue to defend my position after making unfounded claims.&nbsp; If you think that my claims are preposterous then you should go look in the deep end of the forum.&nbsp; One of the reasons that I enjoy this forum is that the moderators tend to be, overall, proponents of free speech, even when degrading accusations are thrown directly at DPR and staff.&nbsp; Fuck, even Limitless was good about letting people speak their mind when he was a mod.&nbsp; Although I do remember accusations that he was deleting posts relating to Vlad, the scamming, and their affiliation.<br /><br />I will continue to support my proclamation that AM is not to be fucked with.&nbsp; I will continue to support my claim that Vlad may be the same that pulled the scam.<br /><br />Also, what constitutes &quot;all over the web?&quot;&nbsp; I tend to disagree that this is &quot;all over the web.&quot;&nbsp;

Then I think the dust settles and things head back to an upward trajectory that they simply can&#039;t reach with our current political system.<br /><br />I mean, not for nothing I mentioned my inspiration for my worldview as &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. <br /><br />My *own* philosophical beliefs are that free market capitalism is the optimal method to arrange our economic affairs because it scales up and has proven itself both productive and adaptable.<br /><br />There is no contradiction here. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right for people to bomb each other to gain economic advantage, otherwise I&#039;d be classifying horrors like the Nazis pulling gold teeth out of Jews as a legitimate business plan, but I do think that is a distinct possibility before things settle down. Some people will be trying modes of governance that are purely based on violence, such as feudalism for example. I think however it is the Free Market proponents who will win the day since their philosophy is most likely to draw support and be the fastest to adapt.<br /><br />So, my view of the future is... messy. It&#039;s not a utopia. It&#039;s not a dystopia either. It&#039;s that en route to a more flexible, economically prosperous and freer future in which Common Economic Protocols govern much of the world, there will be a lot of conflicts. In order for creation, you have to have destruction. That is all wrapped up with the concept of &quot;no state&quot;.<br /><br />In short: I believe, for moral reasons, DOSing your competitor, or worse, murdering them, is wrong. I&#039;m also sure that they will happen in the future.<br /><br />So there is no contradiction, it&#039;s more a frame of reference issue, micro-pine-view vs macro-world-view. What I believe != to what I want. <br /><br />Otherwise I&#039;d just believe we&#039;re going to swan ourselves into a luxurious libertarian utopia (in which I shall have you know my sweet little friends the platypuses live wild and free, inhabiting the riverbanks of every continent) and be done with it.<br /><br />--<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153092.msg1062223#msg1062223">Quote from: SelfSovereignty on April 29, 2013, 05:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As for the PGP cracking software, it&#039;s not as effective as they make it out to be.&nbsp; Yes, it works in certain circumstances, but it&#039;s nothing nearly as scary as simply stripping away the encryption with ease.&nbsp; Use a safe key size (e.g. 2048+ bit RSA) and don&#039;t allow them to gain access to your machine and you&#039;re perfectly safe.&nbsp; They can&#039;t wave a magic wand and crack that.<br /><br />Now I have no clue who the fuck did what or not here, but to say they can decrypt PGP encrypted data as though it weren&#039;t encrypted is a lie.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s right.

Many are being forced out and shutdown. Although they purely sell legal drugs, Customs puts the highest priority on intercepting legal drugs from other countries and calling them &quot;counterfeit&quot;. It&#039;s very corrupt and is happening in most countries that pretend to be free market economies. Although counterfeits do exist, the fact is that most of the IOP trade is legitimate and effectively it is being robbed by a group of legal cartels, quasi government/corporate monopolies. This is a big part of the reason why standard drugs are so expensive in the USA.<br /><br />Take for example generics. When USA IP protection expires, our pharmaceutical companies have to allow competitors in poorer countries to replicate their product i.e. a generic.<br /><br />However, what really happens is that the pharmaceutical companies, basically bribe their way out of the situation. They create a copycat drug which is almost identical, and start pushing that using heavy marketing. At the same time, they get somebody to get Customs to intercept any packages or shipments from overseas containing the generics. Now they have their (leaky) monopoly back for a while until the cycle repeats itself. I believe this to be the biggest reason why drugs in the US and other western countries are so expensive. It is essentially a powerful conspiracy against the consumer.<br /><br />Some numbers: <br /><br />Drugs like Xanax and Zoloft can be worth up to 500,000% profit per pill to the monopoly.<br /><br />It makes the markup on heroin from Afghanistan to US streets look pitiful (can be 150,000%, in theory), and that&#039;s the highest ROI there is short of LSD, but you can&#039;t sell that in such bulk.<br /><br />In short, it makes perfect sense for IOPs to join SR and others on the Darknet. They are in the same bracket as us anyhow, they just don&#039;t fully appreciate it yet. IOPs and similar markets are going to take Darknet Markets to the mainstream in a big way.<br /><br />There are enormous profits to be made by smuggling perfectly genuine and legal drugs. Nootropics like Adderall and Modafinil are just the beginning.

There is software on the market that can crack PGP. Some of you already know of it. LE has it. If Atlantis is a DEA honeypot, then even if you use PGP when transferring your personal information, they could still be saving and decrypting every single one of your messages.<br /><br />I believe that Atlantis is a DEA honeypot and that the DDOS attacks are being made in order to drive users to Atlantis, where the DEA will have access to all of their communications due to the fact that they can crack your PGP.<br /><br />http://www.elcomsoft.com/efdd.html<br /><br />That&#039;s the software. If you put in an order over Atlantis, then they can store your PGP message and decrypt it at their leisure using this software.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This isn&#039;t really true.<br /><br />The software is more analogous to a keylogger than software with the ability to brute force PGP. It does things like intercept private keys. Interception != cracking. This is actually why we use Tor and other anonymizers, because if LE don&#039;t know where we are, they can&#039;t get to our private keys by spying and thereby decrypt our communications.<br /><br />I am wary of Atlantis and their ideas about what constitutes secure communications. Nonetheless to say they can decrypt your messages if they are already PGP encrypted by you (not by Atlantis or any other 3rd party) is not true. It is computationally infeasible.<br /><br />And we have no evidence that I&#039;ve seen so far that Atlantis is responsible for the DOS.<br /><br />The DEA definitely cannot crack PGP. If the DEA could crack PGP, they, their entire organization, not us, would be a smear on the geopolitical windshield in about five seconds. Not by us. By other powers in the world who want the same information. PGP is no joke, and cracking it is no joke either. If PGP was cracked you&#039;d hear about it on the mainstream news headlines in the same reverentially fearful tones as a nuclear bomb going off or a declaration of war between western nation states.

But that does not include DOS on your competitors. The admins of Atlantis should make a statement about whether they are involved in that or not instead of sitting there preening themselves with their sockpuppets and astroturfed marketplace vendors. They should do so out of their own interest, otherwise this DOS could be a DEA ploy to get the two marketplaces to clash and begin a hackerwar for no reason.<br /><br />SR and BlackMarketReloaded have been competing for ages, backopy and DPR don&#039;t have issues with each other, just mutual respect, so competition isn&#039;t the issue. Being a bunch of jerks, is. Atlantis certainly have not endeared themselves to me and I strongly get the sour grapes vibe after visiting their forum recently. That is what I don&#039;t understand, because there&#039;s infinitely more marketplace to go around by breaking into the traditional black market in RL, get those people on board. I can&#039;t understand why they even think SR is the main competition. They carp about how they are only in it for the money, but I&#039;m not seeing them do anything other than attempt to poach SR customers, which is lame. Everybody should be working on cracking open the IOP market, the bitcoin OTC market, and the multi-billion dollar trade known as the RL black market.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I set up an account on Atlantis last night.

Something like that anyway. :-/<br /><br />I just want Silk Road to come back online so I can sell on here again. Atlantis has so far only given me one sale in 24 hours.

Realistically speaking, this site won&#039;t be around for another year or more, but everything we list will be professionally grown by myself, and I will have very efficient and friendly customer service personnel to meet whatever demand we acquire. <br /><br />We don&#039;t plan to make it a very large operation off the bat, so the hidden service, and knowledge there-of will be limited to invitational registration, and strictly word-of-mouth exposure. We will not be spamming here on the boards, but we will certainly approach those who&#039;ve proven themselves to not be cops, and not be idiots. We&#039;ll allow free vendorship to a handful of SR vendors who want to strictly deal in bulk, but will not try to undercut what we truly believe to be a perpetual-motion machine; The Silk Road. <br /><br />In the meantime, we hope the douche-bags stop trying to overload the server(s) here, and we will continue to offer rewards to those who proactively post and call-out scammers; leading to an official banishment of the vendor(s).<br /><br />Atlantis... they could be anybody. I wouldn&#039;t run my game the way they have, with all this hype, on an already hyped up site? <br /><br />I&#039;m sure that DPR and crew love that this site continues to grow, but in the same light I know they understand that a higher percentage of the buyers AND vendors would be happier if this site was less-well known. Less scammers, less cry babies... less children being internet tough-guys&#039; and know-it-alls&#039; ... <br /><br />Anyway, when the SR goes down, I come here to talk to my vendors. All or most of the good ones use these boards. Esp. bud vendors... Christy... Norcal... <br /><br />Some times these people will work out of escrow for the right customer, in the right circumstances... so the show always goes on, if you play your cards right. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi, I&#039;m not a cop (I think), can I apply?<br /><br />But seriously, this sounds like a great idea in case SR is down and I would love to be a part of it.

				My experience with Atlantis so far: <br /><br />3 weeks ago, a vendor was offering &quot;Free 1/2g samples of MDMA&quot;. I debated about it, then a combination of greed and the fact that there was a quantity available tab and it was going down quickly made me order. The vendor was quick to respond after I ordered and said he couldn&#039;t decrypt my address. I sent him a PRIVNOTE and he thanked me and marked it shipped the next day. Now, on SR I ALWAYS order domestic to avoid customs. I wasn&#039;t paying attention that this was from Canada. About 3 years ago, a friend in Canada sent me a few 100mg morphine pills that were intercepted by Customs. I don&#039;t know if that flagged my address or not, but the &quot;sample&quot; never arrived.<br /><br />Now, before I read these posts on SR forums, I placed a very small order from Peoples Drugstore. After reading the posts on here, I don&#039;t expect to receive anything but I will update.
