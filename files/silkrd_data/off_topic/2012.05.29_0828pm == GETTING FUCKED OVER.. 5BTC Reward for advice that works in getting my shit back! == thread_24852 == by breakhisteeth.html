				Stripe him! Stripe that cunt like a zebra! Then put an IV drip above his head that slowly releases drops of paint thinner down his bloodied body.<br /><br />/LimetlessModeOff<br /><br />Ball gag that bitch, then put him in a Japanese school girl uniform, bend him over and fist his asshole nice and proper like, then slice his taint up with a razor knife. Video tape the whole thing, mail it to his Mom, while she&#039;s watching it in shock kidnap that whore and stuff her cunt full of army ants and gorilla glue it shut.<br /><br />/GaryOakModeOff

				What&#039;s damaging himself or his body help you with getting your stuff back? Just when you find him smile to him and get close to him with a knife in his chest and tell him, Give me the stuff now or i will rip your heart. Kindly of course, Last thing you wanna do is have blood on your shirt. But ohh well if it has to go that way, so be it.&nbsp; ;)

				You are not being honest !<br /><br />Tell him that you lied when you told him,<br />that there was no track and trace.<br /><br />Every package has track and trace, <br />it is just that you did not know how to access that information.<br /><br />Now that you do, show him to proof it.<br /><br />Now that you have said sorry, <br />you can say that you are sorry too that he failed you.<br /><br />Because the &quot;&quot;stuff&quot;&quot; was delivered when he hold the key&#039;s.

				Break his fucking fingers and demand he give your shit back...<br /><br />Or tell him he&#039;s caught, but you might want to consider his reaction. He may just deny having it. Either way, if you know for certain he has it, break his fucking fingers!

				1 Why are you dealing with a &#039;friend&#039; who you don&#039;t trust for shit. That&#039;s your first mistake.<br />2 What will you gain from breaking some bones? Are you 100% certain? Is the crime worth the time?<br />3 The golden rule with Silk Road (or any illegal investment for that matter) is don&#039;t put in what you can&#039;t afford to lose.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to sound harsh. I feel for you, I really do, that&#039;s alot of money. Just don&#039;t make a bad situation worse.<br />It does sound like he&#039;s guilty, I would be going mad if I had lost an investment, trying everything to find out what&#039;s happened.<br />Hope it works out for you. I wish you better luck in the future.

				First of all, do you want to be justified in punishing him, assuming your hunch is correct, or do you want the cash or do you want the mdma?<br /><br />Are you and him dealing/using or both? Depending on this answer, he might not have the package anymore, or significantly reduced. If so, then hurting him badly enough might make him turn the cops on you, and you don&#039;t sound exactly squeaky clean (as far as his word vs. yours). It sounds like you have more to lose than he does (besides physical functions of the body).<br /><br />I take it you don&#039;t have a car, to drive to this other town? If he&#039;s a friend, what makes you think this will be the last time you see him?<br /><br />However, he has a motorcycle, AND a job. Have your strong friend steal the bike from him, or stick something in the gas tank, make him walk home. I wouldn&#039;t rat to the cops for revenge, but maybe he could lose his job to a drug test, or get him kicked out of his new place.<br /><br />If you can really tell by his behaviour that hes guilty/lying, see if you can make him &#039;fess up before you show your hand, and if you do, tell him you got the tracking numbers from the vendor, as its been moved to the resolution center or whatever. Have you and a friend escort him back to his new place and search it for money and product.<br /><br />The moment you harm him, you kiss your shit goodbye and any chance of reclaiming it or an equivalent, and you throw your freedom into risk. So which is more important?<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
