				About 2 years ago I used to weigh around 110 kg at 5&#039;9&quot;, people were commenting, my dad told me &quot;you HAVE to lose weight&quot;, I felt uncomfortable about myself, even walking around the street.<br /><br />Amphetamines as appetite suppressants have helped me come down to around 80 kg in 2 years, everybody is complimenting me at work and in my family, &quot;wow, you look great&quot; etc.<br /><br />Of course they don&#039;t know about the little chemical helpers I have, but I don&#039;t think I could have stuck through with the diet and hunger pangs without them.<br />Since I do sports regularly as well, I now nearly have a good beach figure. I also take care to regularly eat enough proteins and vitamines, not to become cachectic and do sports regularly.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m aware of the risks etc., and I don&#039;t overdo it, still if you only hear all the negatives involved with illegal drugs here is an example of where drugs have improved at least one aspect of a person&#039;s life.<br /><br />And yes, I know about psychological addiction and other health issues involved, I don&#039;t take them every day anyway.<br /><br />How about the media makes a report about something like this?

				Weed reduced my stress and depression enough to raise my grades at the end of high school and get me motivated to help out more around the house, so that my relationship with my parents overall improved.<br /><br />During a therapeutic ecstasy session with a friend, I was recounting an experience from my childhood and suddenly I was myself and my child self at once, experiencing the memory and the present. Since then my memories are consistently more vivid and I can recall many more memories from my childhood more easily.<br /><br />Acid and shrooms have helped me learn who I want to be, what I&#039;m afraid of, and how to see beauty and wonder in everything around me like I did when I was little but moreso. They&#039;ve made me generally more patient and more loving and more accepting. General personality improvements like that.<br /><br />Low doses of DMT have helped me feel more sure of my place in the universe, spurring me on to do the things I want to in this life.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought a lot lately about how much altering my perception and thoughts has affected me and my life, and it&#039;s easy to see why I have a now-permanent sense of wonder and novelty about marijuana, lsd, shrooms, DMT, and really psychoactives in general. Those listed are just my favorites by a long shot.<br /><br />I also feel I should say I find it unwaveringly important to make sure that drugs don&#039;t get in the way of life. They should improve it overall if anything, helping you to be more cheerful and motivated and creative and passionate. (maybe that&#039;s just me, I romanticize things, especially when I&#039;m baked)

				Alcohol is a drug too, though it certainly is dangerous. Alcohol has taught me that opening up to people isn&#039;t so hard after all. Alcohol is like a gateway drug for me, releasing a few of my inhibitions (to a lot) as the night progresses. As I grew older, I found that booze was an awesome social lubricant: You become the greatest of friends when you&#039;re up in the clouds with someone else. I won&#039;t say that alcohol is necessary, it&#039;s just nice to have. My first few experiences were awesome, until my first major hangover. The hangover taught me that I am not invincible, that there are some things you shouldn&#039;t fuck around with. It taught me that I have to know my limits, though sometimes exceeding these limits may be desirable.<br /><br />My second drug experience was with weed. If there ever was a miracle herb, it would be weed. Weed has shown me that there is a lot to life that is hidden from plain sight. Essentially, it opened up my mind to just how beautiful and fun life can be. When I first smoked weed, my first thought was &#039;Why isn&#039;t everyone doing this?&#039;. Back home (South East Asia) the penalty for drug possession is hanging. Morbid, yes. That&#039;s why I aimed to experience as much freedom as I could when I was in the United States, and weed was one such freedom that I readily embraced. The next few years (even now) I have been using weed as a way to unwind, to relax, to enjoy LIFE. I began to appreciate everything more: the taste of food, the sound of music, the feel of grass on my feet. EVERYTHING is just more enjoyable on weed.<br /><br />After returning home from the US, I found my most recent drug encounter. I feel that this one can be considered my most life-changing experience: Ecstasy. I was at first a bit skeptical about the drug. There was just so much propaganda out in my country. E was bad. E kills. E is addictive. NONE of which was true! Because of my experience with weed, I - with an opened mind - did my own research into this near mythical (then) drug. I had a rave to go to, my friend invited me. It would be the most amazing 6 hours of my year. I took half a pill with my girlfriend, and after 10 minutes all I could feel was the music, the energy, the amazing-ness of LIFE. Taking E was so profound it changed my music preferences immediately. I used to be a variety listener. Anything that sounded good would be acceptable. Now my definite favorite genre is EDM. I think the drug made me so appreciative of life that all I ever want to listen to is something happy, something that brings your spirits up, that tells you that it&#039;s great to be alive.<br /><br />I would heartily encourage any of my friends to do these drugs. The effect on my mind and my outlook on life was just that great. I look around at my other friends and see the mundane lives they live, never knowing about the amazing world that is out there waiting for those who dare. Drugs are life changing if you let them do what they are supposed to. LSD is next on my list, and I just can&#039;t wait.

				Marijuana (and all THC-based concentrates) have worked better for me than any of the dozens of anti-depression/anti-anxiety medications prescribed to me by my shrink. After trying so many different kinds of meds, I felt like a zombie walking around every day, just repeating the same monotonous tasks. Once I started smoking daily (and not taking the medications) I was able to live again.

I was coming down and feeling tired after 3 hours of weed and music (was about 12am, with another 4 hours to go). My friend finally arrived and gave me his LAST one that he somehow saved from his group to split between me and my girl. I thought it would be a nice feeling to have, but nothing too spectacular... 15 minutes in all my tiredness went away. 30 minutes in I was jumping, reaching for the sky, feeling the music in my soul. Seriously unforgettable and life changing shit :D<br />
