				So we&#039;ve proven through many trials that TOR and bitcoins can be nigh untraceable, but we&#039;ve so far used the technology (in this specific community) mostly for drug transactions.&nbsp; In the last year or so we&#039;ve seen unprecedented democratic protests throughout many Muslim nations and other such revolutionary change taking place.&nbsp; China is emerging as a global power, yet the government is still somehow maintaining its stranglehold on freedom and truth.<br /><br />We&#039;ve seen TOR as a major player in many of the recent movements for change, but we&#039;ve not seen BTCs in play as much as they could be.&nbsp; Why have we seen ideological and moral support, but hardly any monetary support for the rebel groups?&nbsp; If even a small fraction of the BTCs used to buy drugs were re-purposed to help fund resistance movements in poorer nations, we could see actual change happen without some bullshit UN observer team watching through binoculars as women and children are massacred.<br /><br />My proposed point of debate is this: how can we decide which resistance movements would be best served by our monetary support, and how do we make sure the money is not siphoned off by any one of the anonymous handlers that the BTCs will need to go through to get where they belong?&nbsp; It is fairly safe to assume this wonderful haven we&#039;ve called home for so many months will be taken down sooner or later.&nbsp; My question is how do we organize and carry out meaningful change while we have this platform and framework with which to operate within?<br /><br />I remember watching in horror in 1989 as Chinese citizens in Tiananmen Square were massacred, with little to no recourse by the World at large.&nbsp; The same government that killed so many civilians that day still oppresses her citizens and is cracking down now more than ever before.&nbsp; As I watch the situation in Syria deteriorate more and more with the World taking minimal action, I refuse to allow Homs and other massacre centers to be forgotten and forgiven like Tiananmen has been.&nbsp; You don&#039;t wait until government tyranny hits close to home before you act, you must make it clear that no human being no matter where they are will be abused without consequence.<br /><br />Perhaps I may find a few like-minded and dedicated individuals here that are willing to risk their own safety to stop this ridiculous onslaught of our brothers and sisters Worldwide.&nbsp; Whatever we can do, even if it isn&#039;t much, we must do.&nbsp; If the rebels are willing to die simply to bring attention to their struggle, the least we can do is ensure their death was not in vain.&nbsp; I apologize if this is entirely out of place here, I just don&#039;t know of any other community that has the knowledge and resources to somewhat safely enable meaningful change.&nbsp; My forefathers fought an empire that the sun was said never to set on, and somehow the underdog group of rebels pulled it off.&nbsp; I&#039;ll never stop being grateful to those rebels, and I&#039;ll never underestimate the real change that even an outgunned group of revolutionaries can enact.<br /><br />Regardless of the skin color, ethnicity, religion, sex, social status, etc. every human being bleeds the same and we need to show the powers-that-be that we will not excuse a single drop of innocent blood spilled without taking retaliatory measures.&nbsp; I may not have the resources to travel to Syria and call to arms, but I have the resources to enable the ones closer to the action to be able to call to arms.

				There aren&#039;t enough bitcoins in the world to help the Syrian resistance, they need millions of dollars in aid and weapons to kill Bashar&#039;s death squads. If you want to help commit financial crime by hacking into databases and stealing credit cards, then clean the profits through bitcoin and give it to the legit charities operating in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. I wouldn&#039;t go there yourself, too dangerous Syrian agents would have you killed simply for providing blankets to refugees. They are operating openly in Lebanon and other border areas.<br /><br />Bonus of doing crime and giving the money away is there is no trail to follow to catch you if you did everything else correctly. Create the Friends of Syria crime site and promise to shut it down once your government is serious about providing assistance to the massacre going on there<br /><br />
