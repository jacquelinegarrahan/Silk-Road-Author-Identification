				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well guys, last saturday I took the last of my tabs I got from tessellated, two of them. I was enjoying a nice LSD trip on a beautiful day in my backyard, but after about the 6 hours mark my visuals really started to wind down a lot. It was nothing like any of my other trips on tessellateds tabs, still the best acid I&#039;ve ever had by far. So I thought shit this kinda sucks... &quot;ohhh fuck I still have some DMT&quot; I told to my friend. I scrambled over to my dresser and found my DMT pipe and my bag. (my DMT pipe is just an old weed pipe I use for DMT. I need to get a freebase oiler soon) I have no clue how much DMT was in the bag if I had to guess maybe around 50-100mg. I dumped the whole bag on top of the old burnt up green tea leaves in my pipe(I can&#039;t smoke weed anymore so I just use tea leaves as a base) I keep pressuring my friend into doing it being a dick, but he said he is done trying new drugs... Ohh well more for me haha.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I go turn the music off, get situated on my couch in a comfy position, my heart starts to race, I wonder how different the experience will be on LSD. I actually started to get a little nervous, must be the acid. Then I just laughed it off and started smoking, or vaping if you will, the DMT. I took a couple decent hits and was seeing some wild shit and decided to close my eyes. Once again, I didn&#039;t smoke enough to blast off. With my eyes closed I started seeing what seemed to be these futuristic looking buildings that were constantly shape-shifting and moving in and out of each other like some sort of machine. And every time a building would move it would make a distinguishable sound. These weren&#039;t just any sounds, it was like I was hearing a completely new, perfect dubstep song. It was very strange. I wasn&#039;t getting the typical geometric patterns and kaleidoscope like visuals I usually do. I then opened my eyes and told my friend about what happened and then he called me a pussy for not smoking enough again hahah. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know what y&#039;all are thinking, that wasn&#039;t a strange DMT experience, what the hell man. I&#039;ve read way cooler trip reports that this. Ahhh, but wait my little friend I have another story for you. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So after opening my eyes I noticed my carpet was doing the most beautiful fractal-like pattern kinda mixed with geometric shapes constantly moving everywhere. I&#039;ve never had visuals like that just on LSD. So I thought, man that looks fucking awesome and beautiful. Imma smoke whatever is left in this pipe and keep my eyes open. And holy shit this was the craziest thing I&#039;ve ever seen. What happened to me was the definition of &#039;tripping.&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I grabbed my pipe took another toke, and man that one hit me kinda hard. I looked around the room, and said &quot;man I&#039;m trippin hard as fuck already, imma try to hit it three more times.&quot; I took one more solid hit and I believe I must have hit a sweet spot on my pipe where a bunch of the DMT gathered after liquifying because I definitely hit enough to blast off. I couldn&#039;t even handle the lighter to hit it again. I put the pipe and the lighter on the end table and just started staring at everything happening. This is going to be very difficult to visualize for y&#039;all, but I will try my best.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I looked out the window and noticed my window basically turned into a kaleidoscope. The trees and everything outside were spinning and shifting in the most beautiful patterns I had ever seen. I looked back down at the carpet and it would doing the same as before just 20x more intense. Everything in the room kept getting more and more intense I was completely overwhelmed with what was happening and couldn&#039;t comprehend most of it. An outlet on the other side of the room caught my eye and then I couldn&#039;t stop staring at it. Each plug inside the outlet were spinning inside of the outlet and then the plugs would drip down to the floor and puddle up on the floor like some white liquid and then droop back up the wall into the outlet and begin spinning again. I had never seen anything that crazy happen while tripping. So I want y&#039;all to imagine what was happening to that outlet and apply it to the entire room. Everything was doing something that crazy and intense if not more. The carpet was literally going up the wall and onto the ceiling and then back down again. I decided to look out the window and the craziest thing happened. I looked out and there were stars, I then felt the feeling of floating and it seemed as though my entire house was floating through space. My couch has vertical lines on them and as soon as I noticed them they shot across the floor and then up the wall and made the entire room striped for a few minutes. Then it began to get way too intense, I couldn&#039;t comprehend anything that was going on, I just remember the whole room started &#039;shaking.&#039; My wall,my windows and everything to the right side of my started &#039;jumping&#039; three feet left and then back again. It was doing it extremely fast and honestly I was pretty scary at the time. After the room &#039;shook&#039; for a few minutes everything started to calm down again, but I had awesome visuals to go with my acid trip for the next hour or so. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know if I would have closed my eyes I would have seen who knows what, but I just wanted to try out keeping my eyes open and it was awesome. I saw some cool shit I&#039;ve never seen before. If you have the DMT to spare I would suggest giving it a try during a LSD trip if you are looking to see some crazy visuals for a little bit. Thanks for reading guys!<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to say I got the DMT for elvis! It&#039;s some good shit! Go check out his vendor page.

				I have had&nbsp; a similar experience with DMT and a 25i-NBOMe hit. I look forward to repeating that again sometime. It was similar structures that you described, the reality with my eyes closed was more real and vivid than with eyes open. Very very interesting. The architecture was grand and amazing. I was in the middle of a huge three story white temple type of thing with my eyes closed. Very spacious and clean. I may elaborate when I have more time.

				Wait for when the time fully stops around you but you in can go on, that&#039;s crazy as shit.<br />It happened to me only once when I asked the DMT to show me the most she could do and I got totally scared in the end (for the first time in my life).<br />Even for me it was a little too much seeing the world OBJECTIVELY stop (or go faster, or slow-mo, i.e. I could totally manipulate the time of the material world) while I could do in it whatever the hell I wanted. This was not subjective, I could either change what people where going to say around me or what they were going to do. <br />But at a point it was too much, even for me, too much power, too intense, you start to wonder if you can short-circuit. Still it was what I needed at the time; I was only interested in power and manipulating others, and that extreme fear made me understand and reconsider priorities in my life.

DMT tends to run away from heat, so upon heating the bowl the DMT will move all around it and not vaporize properly. You inhale maybe half of what you scaled out and the rest will recrystallize on the inside of the pipe. Its a pain in the ass and you just end up getting a burnt lip or frustrated when it refuses to vaporize.<br /><br />I thought the exact same thing as you, I ended up wasting $15 on a nice meth pipe which I used twice for DMT and never used again. Still with melting it into ash on a pipe or use an electric vaporizer/DMT machine&nbsp; 8)
