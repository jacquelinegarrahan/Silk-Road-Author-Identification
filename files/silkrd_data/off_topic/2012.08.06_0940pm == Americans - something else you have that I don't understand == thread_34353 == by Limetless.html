				What are these Summer Camp things that you send your children to? Do you really send your kids there all Summer? Are the way they are portrayed on T.V accurate? <br /><br />We don&#039;t have these things here and I find them quite intriguing.

				They are sex camps. Orgies are encouraged on a daily basis. Children are force fed hamburgers and cock. It&#039;s a christian-cleansing program.

				That depends on the type of summer camp. The ones that are sports oriented tend to last for 4-6 weeks at a time. Some camps that are more local operate on a basic schedule of 8-5...Examples of these are religious camps, or day-care type ones that bring the kids to amusement parks and movie theatres while the parents are at work.

So long as you pay to send ya sprogs to these camps of course. If so I think I&#039;m having kids in America.

				ha ha!&nbsp; funny thread.&nbsp; i like the cross pond dialogs we have here.<br /><br />i went to two scary christian summer camps as a kid but they were each only for a week.&nbsp; i&#039;m sure my parents loved having a week off, but it was fucking terrible.&nbsp; i begged them not to send me there again and thankfully they listened after the second year.&nbsp; its not like i got raped or tortured or anything, but it was just a week with the dorkiest losers on the planet, eating shitty food, doing chores, singing gay ass songs about the bible, reading the bible, talking about the bible, and yelling &quot;praise the lord&quot; when you score a goal in soccer.&nbsp; If i had ever had a moment to myself to do what i wanted maybe it wouldn&#039;t have been so bad but it was just as tightly scheduled as school.<br /><br />friends of mine who went to non-religious summer camps as kids always talk about how much they enjoyed it.&nbsp; christians ruin everything

				There&#039;s a movie called Fat Camp and it&#039;s awesome. After watching it I always wanted to a summer camp. There&#039;s a pretty cool music camp that I wanted to attend when I was younger.

				summer camps are funny. parents let their kids explore super homosexual activities like orchestra camp or fuckin drama camp or some shit. It&#039;s mostly cause the parents don&#039;t raise social enough kids to develop friends and then they eventual shoot a bunch of people because they never had friends.

				I once went to one of those christian summer camps. It was really something out of a movie. Every morning they had us learn a passage from the bible and we couldn&#039;t go to breakfast until we were able to recite it from memory 100% perfect. The funny thing is one of the activities we did was firing off shotguns at targets. Right before we would start shooting we&#039;d say a prayer thanking god for allowing us the opportunity to shoot some guns and have fun.<br /><br />I was only 11 at the time so I wasn&#039;t allowed to use the real guns, you had to be 12 to do that. Shot my friend in the leg with an air rifle though, funny shit.

				This topic was nuf to take me out of lurker status. <br /><br />Summer camps are a great American (North American?) tradition. I went to and worked at one for many years. I also send my kids to one. You just have to choose one wisely. Pick one that focuses on outdoor experiences over religion and is for both boys and girls. All boy camps are creepy. <br /><br />I should add that sneaking away to smoke weed with the other counselors back in the 80s is likely why I&#039;m at SR today!

				I&#039;m all for looser gun laws, I just found it amusing in a really stereotypical sense that I was in a christian summer camp where 12 year olds were allowed to fire shotguns ;D

				I went to a bible camp one time with my aunt. I expected it to be shit and boring but it was actually really fun. I was 13 at the time. I recall it though. I just skipped the 3 church sessions every day. The food was good, there were kids swimming and doing their own thing. Good food, bunk beds, bitches and boats. (It was on a lake)<br /><br />[ I tried to hook up with a 15 year old big-titty decent looking girl, which worked for about 18 hours and her mom saw us holding hands. She had to go pray or whatever and wasn&#039;t allowed to talk to me anymore. I traded her in for a new girl, whose dad had a boat. He took us all out speeding around the lake and doing fun stuff. It was decent but the girl had no boobs and I was more aligned to city-13, where I had already been smoking weed and fingering girls etc. The country-13 or &quot;sheltered&quot; I should say, was a very hard conversation. They were about hula-hoops and those &quot;do you like me?&quot; notes. ]<br /><br />I went to the church one time just to see what they did, they just prayed and sang and the stuff mentioned in here. I avoided the late night campfire song stuff. I remember hearing about it but I don&#039;t recall seeing them do it. It was one of the better experiences in my life. I knew nobody except my aunt and her husband so that was kinda fun to just be misplaced with a lot of sexual tension in a church atmosphere. The food was good but everyone ate in the same huge dining hall, which was probably about 100-150 people, maybe more. I didn&#039;t have to do any chores but I helped big-tits do some place-settings and clean up.<br /><br />Well, that turned into a ramble.<br /><br />I would never force my kids to go, especially not to a bible camp but if they want to go to a camp, that&#039;d be fine. If they choose to go to bible camp, so be it. I don&#039;t remember any of the prayers but do remember a lot of the experience so I would definitely encourage it to anyone considering it for their kids. Pick a good camp. I regretted not going sooner.
