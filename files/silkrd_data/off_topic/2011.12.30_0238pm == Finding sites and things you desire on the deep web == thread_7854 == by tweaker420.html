				Hey I am new to the deep web and I although I have found my way around somewhat easily, I still haven&#039;t figured out how to get passed what the hidden wiki has to offer and I know there is a lot more out there. What can I do to find what I am looking for and explore the deep web more?

				If you have a certain type of site in mind, try to make some friends and ask around. All the good sites URL&#039;s are usually passed via pm/chat etc and never posted out in the open.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m trying to make connects to get into the private carding scene, have been unsuccessful thus far though. SR isn&#039;t the best place to find carders I think lol.<br /><br />Try the SR SILC chat :) Always friendly guys in there that might help you out also.

Oddly enough several of them have told me they stay away from SR because of the attention it got when it was mentioned during a congressional hearing earlier last year and the fear that the popularity of the drug trade here would get them busted if the site went down. I think their fears are kind of funny because I tend to believe certain things like carding, guns, and similar things would bring Sr unwanted heat (especially the guns - nothing ruins a day faster than the ATF slapping ya with a terrorism label to bypass their normal legal limits in persuing people).<br /><br />

				@ xx138xx : The thing is I used to think the same way but sites like BudMail are way more bait and STILL haven&#039;t been successfully shut down, that goes for DGC aswell at least SR has thought about securing his shit by whacking it on a Tor network rather then in just plain view on the net.<br /><br />imo it won&#039;t be shut down til a few people die and the press manages to link their purchases to SR that any action will really be taken on the site..(just a matter of budget/resources needed)<br /><br />..and even then some people already have made their own personal &quot;address books&quot; of vendors they like so should anything happen to the site they can still stay in touch and be added on their own mailing lists..
