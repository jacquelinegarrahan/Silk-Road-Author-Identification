				The value of Bitcoins seem to fluctuate up and down quite rapidly.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if there will be a big dip again after Burning Man or the summer time is over.&nbsp; Is there a way of predicting the low points?&nbsp; Since I&#039;ve been on SR for a little over a month the value has gone from the lowest point of about 6.2 jumping up to 11.3 and now coming down again.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering if there&#039;s&nbsp; a way to chart the Bitcoins or predict the value on a bi-weekly basis.&nbsp; xx - Kitty

				I think it actually went to 15+ recently.<br /><br />If you figure out a way to predict the market make sure you post it here. ;-)<br />I believe the only way to predict is doing just what you are, thinking about the market forces that will effect the price.

				I have an app that I check daily that gives me the exchange rate of bitcoin to USD currency.&nbsp; I checked it this week and it seemed to be going down (about $10usd = 1BTC).&nbsp; So I used buybitcoin.com, Bruce Wagner&#039;s company to exchange about 2k to bitcoins.&nbsp; Huge mistake!!&nbsp; I just realized after I wired the money to him and transferred the Bitcoins to my wallet here that something was wrong...<br /><br />His exchange rate is $22/BTC!!!&nbsp; WTF??!&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s almost double what it&#039;s supposed to be!&nbsp; I figured since he&#039;s the leader in the Bitcoin industry and he is so reputable, he would not scam his customers like this.&nbsp; Fuck!&nbsp; I sent him an email and plan to call him until we can come to some sort of resolution.&nbsp; I hope I can send my BTC back to him and get my money back.&nbsp; I lost almost $1000 because I trusted his company.&nbsp; Holy fuck!<br /><br />I came on SR to buy ketamine at a reasonable rate.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only thing that helps with my depression.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like drinking, using anti-depressents or any other sort of drug.&nbsp; A few bumps of K is all I need and yes it may be illegal, but it&#039;s the only thing that works for me.<br /><br />In the US, an oz of K is between 1200 and 1400 dollars.&nbsp; &nbsp;On SR it is about half that amount.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was so happy when I stumbled upon SR and made my first transaction with Ivory.&nbsp; The exchange rate was low and I got my package safe and sound in about a week.<br /><br />Then a month later all hell broke loose.&nbsp; Ivory was on vacation so I use aakoven.&nbsp; He scammed me out of $175 and never sent my package.&nbsp; Then I transfer $2000 to Wagner only to get $875 back.&nbsp; Fuck!&nbsp; I&#039;m losing faith in bitcoins and SR.&nbsp; I could have just bought an oz of K from my local dealer for $1300 which is how much I lost through buybitcoin.com and aakoven!!&nbsp; &nbsp;ughh!!&nbsp; Lesson learned...

Gox and ONLY buy them when you&#039;re going to buy something immediately from SR as the rate of a bitcoin fluctuates alot! (People will say don&#039;t buy them from Mt. Gox as it&#039;s not anonymous etc. but if you&#039;re purchasing quantities for personal use then nothing will come of it).<br /><br />b) Being a ketamine fan I&#039;ll recommend &#039;FartBomber&#039; to you as he has great K and always delivers promptly.. as does Ivory even though I haven&#039;t tried his K, I hear great things about it!<br /><br />c) There is alot of stories of scamming from &#039;aavoken&#039; personally I haven&#039;t ordered from him and don&#039;t think I ever will, his ketamine is dirt cheap which reflects the quality being dirt aswell.<br /><br />d) Before buying from a vendor do a quick search on the forums to see if there are any reviews about them.. not sure how you got scammed by aavoken but make sure you always stay in escrow.<br /><br />Hope you have a better experience with your next purchase!

				Thanks for the advice!&nbsp; So happy Ivory is back from vacation:)&nbsp; <br /><br />If all else fails, I&#039;m going to buy a huge bag of K from him.&nbsp; Just sucks that It will cost me double because I made the mistake of using Wagner&#039;s awful company.&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Where does he get the nerve to just make up his own exchange rate??&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I can&#039;t afford to make anymore mistakes...literally, my trust in people is costing me a small fortune!
