				With the diversity on these forums in terms of hobbies/sports etc I&#039;m kinda curious who here is a fan of Formula 1? <br /><br />Who did you follow last season?<br />Who will you be following this season? Did you decide to follow a different team due to driver or sponsorship change? <br /><br />Will be following Daniel Ricciardo as he&#039;s from the same city as I. Number 1 team I&#039;ll be following is RBR due to Webber and Vettel being great drivers and will keep an eye on Kimi Räikkönen and his partner Grosjean.<br /><br />On another small discussion, Formula 1 in terms of safety wouldn&#039;t be how it is today without Ayrton Senna (may he RIP) and the tragic accident which took his life.. lead to a bigger safety impact and the creation of the HANS device. <br /><br />I remember watching Formula 1 from an early age onwards with my dad, never missed a GP. 18 years later still watching. Went to Singapore last year to watch the Singapore F1 GP, amazing hearing these V8s in real life!

				Yeah if love the F1. ;)<br /><br />Will be keeping an eye on Lewis in his new car. Brawn is very smart, so even though they are new, they might still be quick.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to Daniel also being australian. If Webber doesnt perform, Daniel might grab his seat, well thats what i heard anyway..<br /><br />I heard F1 might be changing to single turbo V6&#039;s in the next few years? Might be speculation but would still be interesting.<br /><br />They would be lighter so track times might improve...<br /><br />But yeah bring it on, also looking forward to seeing how Benz and Nissan go in the V8&#039;s. Was so boring with just holden and ford.

				Correct. The 2014 season will be using turbocharged 1.6L V6 engines, haven&#039;t read if single or twin applications yet. Very keen to see how that goes.<br /><br />The V8 supercars are pretty much a driver sport, when all drivelines are limited to set amount of HP/nm of torque. Although, from what I&#039;ve read, the Nissan V8 (VK designated motor)will be DOHC whereas current Ford/Holdens are still SOHC.<br /><br />Track times may improve, but ultimately I can&#039;t see much of an improvement when it&#039;s compared to times needed to change starting positions, but I may be wrong, guess we have to wait til next year.<br /><br />Got my tickets for the Australian F1GP, just need plane and hotel tickets.
