				After 2 years of saving up I finally raised enough cash to buy my first pill press, this is really exciting for me because I am still quite young, not legally allowed to drink or smoke in my home country yet&nbsp; ;D, I am having a few different punches &amp; dies made for me right now with some unique designs and I really want to make a silkroad pill, with a logo of a camel or a person on a camel on it. If one of you lovely people out their would be kind enough to make a basic black and white image that is not over detailed and would look good on a 9mm pill I would for sure turn it into a real press, I would already be having it made but the people I get my dies from say that the current logo is much to complex.

				I&#039;d just like to mention what you&#039;re asking for is known as a &#039;Vector&#039; image. I don&#039;t have time to make you one now, but I&#039;m sure someone here will be kind enough to.

However at the moment this place is just classed as a sales-platform, if people start churning out Silk Road branded pills then that just makes this place look like an actual drug cartel which brings a whole new level of heat than cyber crime. Why would you want to bring this extra heat upon yourself? The law wont give a fuck if whoever made them was sanctioned or not, that wont even come into the mix, it will just be the fact that Silk Road branded pills, were being sold on Silk Road and even if DPR just let ya get on with it and didn&#039;t care they could interpret that as him sanctioning it which then turns him into Pablo Escobar. <br /><br />I understand the thought and I think it&#039;s a cool notion but I just think for the reasons I just stated it&#039;s a bad idea. No point adding more pressure when it&#039;s not needed.
