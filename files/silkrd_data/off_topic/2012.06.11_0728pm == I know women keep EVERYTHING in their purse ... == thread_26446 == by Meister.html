				Man, you would have to be fucked to your eyeballs, or just completely retarded to do something like that when you know that police are on their way to arresting you. Sounds like she wanted to go down&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Locker.

				When I read the title of this thread I was hoping &quot;Purse&quot; would be a euphemism for &quot;Vagina&quot;....I was however disappointed and am now dismayed....<br /><br />-1 Karma Meth-Bottle-Lady for not manufacturing Meth in your vagina.

				ok, maybe they can detain you, just checked.<br /><br />I think the moral is, don&#039;t steal.&nbsp; If they try and detain you and you didn&#039;t steal, then they don&#039;t have the legal authority to detain you, throw some 2c-P in their eyes.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Could you imagine that?&nbsp; Fuck pepper spray, get 2c-P-spray :)
