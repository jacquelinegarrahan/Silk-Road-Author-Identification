				Hey guys,<br />So I just wanted to ask about a strange phenomenon I have experienced. After one of the first times I smoked weed, I fell asleep while still under its effects. I remember waking up the next morning and just laying there, feeling high and unable to move (it wasn&#039;t very pleasurable and confusing since this was 12 hours after ingestion). Then, I remember waking up AGAIN, wondering if that was real or not. Since then, most of the nights after I smoke (even if I&#039;ve completely come down and sometimes in the nights following ingestion) I feel high again drifting into sleep, during sleep (in dreams), and waking up (it seems to be a pseudo-wake-up though). Then, my girlfriend was telling me about how the same thing happened to her, independent of me telling her about it. I asked my friend, and he said nothing like it had happened to him. Then, a couple days ago, he was like yeah, that same thing happened to me. Is this normal? I&#039;ve never heard anything about this before. Just wondering if this happens to other people.

				Sounds a bit like false awakening: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_awakening. Weed could be intensifying it, but I&#039;m no doctor.

				I sleep like a stone after weed.<br /><br />If you want REALLY vivid dreams that feel real try Kratom :D

				I get that all the time it&#039;s sleep paralysis. For me it feels as if I can&#039;t breathe properly.<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis<br /><br />I get it after smoking weed too.

				It&#039;s possible your weed is laced with JWH or other RC.

				i use weed to sleep every night.&nbsp; i find that when i sleep immediately before bed i often wake sluggishly and still feel slightly buzzed for a few hours.&nbsp; if i fully come down (weed works as a stim for me (unless 100% indica) and &quot;coming down&quot; is getting tired) and then go to sleep i wake very refreshed.&nbsp; however i always have vivid dreams and cannabis seems to intensify them and push them towards lucid.&nbsp; so it&#039;s a trade off.&nbsp; lucidity = sluggish wake up and deep sleep = anxious, shoot right up.<br />honestly tho it&#039;s the best sleep aid for me.&nbsp; even after an all day adventure with 4-flouroamphetamine a good bowl puts me into cozy land.<br />maybe leave a few hrs after ur last smoke or eat some milky, rich meal before sleep?&nbsp; (a tiny bowl of oatmeal brings me down nice)<br />i dunno tho.&nbsp; everyone&#039;s body chemistry is different.<br />*destiny*

				For males, weed dreams often begin with puberty. However, it should not concern you if these continue sporadically throughout one&#039;s life.
