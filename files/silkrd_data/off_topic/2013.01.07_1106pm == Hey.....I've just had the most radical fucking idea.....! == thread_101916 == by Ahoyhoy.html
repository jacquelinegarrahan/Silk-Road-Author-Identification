				My friend and I took some wicked coke at the weekend. He was off his face and talking shit. At one point he proclaimed that he had just had a potentially world beating business idea. After building up to it for five minutes, he eventually told me his idea and...surprise surprise it was the biggest pile of old shite I have ever heard. <br /><br />It got me thinking about things we may have said whilst high which at the time might have felt like the deepest, most world shattering idea we&#039;d ever had - which turned out to be a stream of arse gravy.<br /><br />I would be interested in hearing both the idea and the drug which promoted it.<br /><br />I have some beauties to offer.... mostly from the same guy.

				Haha great thread idea, ill have to try and remember some of this idiotic stuff me and my mates come up with. It is usually when we smoke pot that we come up with ground-breaking ideas, then realize the next day what a load of bullocks they were.

				This might fit into this thread but I have this asshole &quot;friend&quot; who stole a bunch of $$ from me when he promised to pick up some drugs...<br /><br />but when he started rolling his friend would sell him M1 and other MDMA like substances but he&#039;d call&nbsp; it &quot;molly&quot; regardless....anyway while&nbsp; this kid kept getting high off nerotoxins every night he&#039;d become more and more self obsessed and would tell us he could feel our &quot;vibes&quot; and what we were thinking. All my friends started to fuck with him and agree and shit and he thought he developed super powers, being able to tell where anyone in the house was because he could sense them, convince people to change their minds with his mind powers etc.<br /><br />it was really fuckin&#039; hysterical. But I hate him cuz he&#039;s a scum bag lol

				<br />Business ideas from Ahoyhoy&#039;s friend &#039;P&#039; when high:<br /><br />1. Mouth vibrator for women who like oral sex<br />2.. Drugs sold in specially diluted amounts for various pets (eg MDMA for dogs). This is for pet owners who would like to share an experience with their best friend<br />3. Door-to-door munchies salesman selling crisps, chocolate etc (targeting areas where cannabis smoking is common)<br />4. &#039;Hair tattoos&#039; for men with bald patches<br />5. Drugs gift tokens - recognised by all local drug dealers and exchangeable for the drug of your choice<br /><br />...and these were all proposed on the same night....
