				Unless your parents are physically or sexually abusing you, you ought to go back. I remember when I was your age, and had similar feelings of unbelonging. It sucks and is tough.<br /><br />But your parents love you even if they find it hard to express or say horrible things and you guys keep arguing all the time. Sometimes when your parents are acting more like children, then you have to be the adult and step up by making allowances to avoid volatile situations and keeping a tighter rein on your own feelings. It&#039;s not worth the both of you feeling hurt and betrayed for the rest of your lives, you should make peace.

				Definitely talk to someone and get a different perspective for contrast. You&#039;re too young to make this type of mistake. Go back home and apologize and talk to you parents like an adult. Remember to listen. Majority of a conversation is listening.<br /><br />Do this and perform well in school and you&#039;ll be out of your parents in 2years at a university. You&#039;ll thank yourself later.

				As already said you have absolutely no reason for not being at home unless you&#039;re being a abused...and this means sexually or heavy unnecessary physical abuse...anything else and you deserve to be thrown out.<br /><br />Kids nowadays are all a bunch of self centered pieces of shit and most deserve to be physically abused simply for the state of mind they carry.<br /><br />Sounds harsh ? Well I stand by what I say, and I fully believe every single child in the world who can TAKE a beating should GET a beating in any case where they for even a split second had zero fear because they DOUBTED a beating.<br /><br />I won&#039;t list out guidelines trying to backtrack where some dick will come in and go &quot;but what about such and such a case?&quot; - you be an asshat, you deserve a beating.<br /><br />I challenge you to find an argument against that...and if you do..well, you deserve a beating

				Sorry to hear about your situation. However, due to your age, you&#039;re likely not going to find an apartment since you have to be at least 18 to enter a legally binding contract, such as a housing agreement. You may be able to find a job somewhere around town if you look hard enough.<br /><br />Best of luck,<br />sdesu

				Take it from someone who has made a similar mistake. I was 16 when I left my parent&#039;s (singular) home. My parent did not approve of my love interest. But I was in love and wanted to build a life around the person I was in love with. Needless to say we are no longer together. We found a small apartment through a friend and worked hard to keep things going. I worked at a local coffee shop and she as a waitress. It was rare we could get our bills paid, let alone keep food on the table. School and financial responsibilities where too much and I dropped school. I made the best with what I had and it wasn&#039;t much. This was some years ago and after the big breakup, homelessness and other mistakes I was sunk. I eventually moved back in with my parent, much wiser now but way behind the curve in terms of getting ahead of life. It took me years of hard work to bolster my education and get to some resemblance of successfulness. If it werent for that minor mistake there is no telling what I could have accomplished or where I would be now. Think very carefully about your decision and know it will impact the rest of your life, heavily. Unless you are being abused, mentally or physically I would reconsider leaving your home. Stick it out if you can, get your diploma and off to college you go where you can be free to express yourself anyway you see fit. Either way good luck

				1. Move back home. <br />2. Practise interviewing for jobs. This will help you with studying as well. <br />3.STUDY. <br />4. Get a job. <br />5. Apply to colleges and look into community colleges(financially the best decision you can make) for the 1st 2 years.<br />6. Live free(at peace) and be happy with you!<br /><br />Also, you can earn money by doing clinical studies at hospitals. Look for studies that have an inclusion of minors. These can last anywhere from 10minsto a couple hours and pay up to $1000. I&#039;ve done these in college and it was a big difference for my wallet :)<br /><br />Anything else? Just ask.<br />

				I agree with what others have said, unless you suffer abuse at home, move back. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t go back, then just be cautious and watchful. Be wary of people who might seem to be your friend, but want to use you. As a runaway you are very vulnerable to exploitation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Obviously I dont know where you are (other than an english speaking country) but if you are in UK or USA look out for the Salvation Army. Much as I dislike organised religion, these guys, unlike many so-called Christians,&nbsp; do actually practice Christian values and actively help those in need.<br /><br />If you are UK reply and I ll give you some places to try.
