				Hey guys, so here&#039;s my situation...<br /><br />- Been dealing MDMA, that I get off the road, locally since last November.<br />- I only deal to friends of friends (lately, I&#039;ve been going to the local afterhours and selling for a couple hours each night, pocket $150-300).<br />- I have a few regulars who I sell to, they grab 5-10 caps/pills every couple weeks, then the random large order occasionally.<br /><br />I started working at a bar and my co-worker parties a lot. He knows a lot of people who do coke. There are also a lot of people who come into the bar (classy place, a lot of gay guys come through as well) who my co-worker has partied with and they do coke as well. I was thinking about tapping into that market a little bit, but my molly customers don&#039;t do coke so I&#039;d have to meet new people, sell at the afterhours, and sell to these guys that come to the bar. <br /><br />I&#039;m known for having good quality MDMA, I want to keep the same reputation through to the coke game too, if I decide to go ahead with this idea.<br /><br />Main problem is: I know nothing (absolutely nothing) about coke. I did heavy heavy research and reading on MDMA before I started selling it. I inform my customers properly, I even give them vitamin c and magnesium (when I deal to friends) to make sure they roll safely (I just inform friends of friends or regular buyers to take VitC and Mag when they first buy). But with coke... I just learned yesterday (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) that fishscale is purer than powder because powder can be cut up. I don&#039;t know what an 8-ball is, I don&#039;t know what a good rate would be, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s even worth buying coke off SR because the prices seem very high (I&#039;m assuming they&#039;re high because they expect people buying it to cut it?). I only make about $500-600 a month-ish off the MDMA sales. From what I&#039;ve heard, cocaine high lasts about 15-45mins from the stuff here locally, but apparently more pure coke will last hours. I would sell the coke as fishscale and let the guy do whatever it is they want to do with it. I&#039;ve never done coke, I don&#039;t think I ever do want to try it, so I don&#039;t know what the purity is of the local stuff vs the SR goods. Any info or links to solid information would be helpful.<br /><br />Do you guys think this is a good idea for me? I haven&#039;t really tried hard to hustle, people just tell their friends and their friends and that&#039;s how I get my business. I don&#039;t go out of my way to look for or ask people, I never sold at events except for a couple times not including the past 3 weekends at the afterhours. Is it worth selling MDMA and coke or should I just stick to and market MDMA in a better way?<br /><br />TL;DR I sell MDMA but want to sell coke. I dont know anything about coke. Should I dive into the market or work on building up my MDMA clientele? <br /><br />OH and I found out that street price here for coke is $40 a gram, if that helps anyone figure out the purity of it.

				I have friends in the FBI, oddly enough...anyway...the top two drugs they are pushed to investigate are mdma (northern border) and cocaine (southern border) heroin comes through the ports (trans-atlantic) so its much harder to regulate than the borders. The reason I mention this is because the narc cops push snitches to find coke and mdma over everything. 1 ounce of cocaine is mandatory minimum 3 years in prison. know what you&#039;re getting into. you can PM me if you want to know how to cut it correctly without making it suck. and no one pays 120$ a gram irl...60$ where I am from. The prices on the road for an ounce are so damn high compared to real life youd make NO money. Unless you&#039;re willing to take a HUGE risk. stay away from the coke game. And selling out of a business adds a few years to that sentence. <br /><br />btw you dont youre popped until youre popped! trust me

				It&#039;s really not going to be worth it for you unless you can get a cheap, high quality bulk connect. Otherwise to make any money you&#039;d have to triple what people are paying now, and yes people pay for quality but that&#039;s a bit much to ask for. Work on your MDMA sales, perhaps try talking to your customers and seeing if there&#039;s anything else they would like to buy. You can make great returns on certain research chemicals that are in high demand.

				with mdma you work with happy ravers...<br /><br />with cocaine you work with paranoid coke heads...<br /><br />its simple and there&#039;s definitely one preferable over the other.<br />

				good advice above. basically unless you risk going with WhiteDreams or you turn into a scumbag that cuts their gear to shit (and lose your &#039;HQ&#039; rep) you can forget about making a profit with coke because of the prices on here

				also, if you start to sample your product you better have an INSANE amount of self control;<br /><br />you can only do so much mandy so it doesn&#039;t eat into your profits much, with coke you can hoover up your profits and your sales stock in a matter of days

				We have been selling XTC/MDMA for many years. Tried a stint in coke a few years back but really didn&#039;t like the clientele (not judging anyone for doing it as always it&#039;s your choice). Be prepared to get gram calls round the clock which can be inconvenient to say the least. Every now and again people still ask me for it to which I reply, &quot;not involved, please don&#039;t ask me for that&quot; - infact, I got woken up by a call for coke early on a MONDAY morning - told them I don&#039;t do this - then they proceeded to text me the same request??? That is one of the reasons I gave u selling it.<br /><br />Also MY own rule is I&#039;m not going to sell something that I have a problem with taking myself. Hence the reason I sell MDMA and other psychedelics.<br /><br />Perhaps you just need to put some more work in and build up your customer base sticking with MDMA - I think it would be hard to buy coke to sell for profit off of SR as previously stated. Best of luck with your endeavors. ;-)<br /><br />Be Good.<br />Santa
