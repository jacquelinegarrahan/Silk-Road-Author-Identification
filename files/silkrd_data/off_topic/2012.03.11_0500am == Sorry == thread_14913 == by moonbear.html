				there are bb scripts you can use that replace the text that a given user types with whatever you like. you can also make it so that user thinks that their posts are normal. there are also methods where users can choose to block certain other users posts. either of these would be preferable to a ban as the guy will just wear himself out rather than double down on dickheadery

				This kid is completely dangerous. I understand there is little recourse for him (outside of extreme measures) but if I was admin I would seriously be considering some way to shut him down completely. As tony mentioned, this is the type of dipshit that overdoses with SR up on his computer. Or the kid that gets banned and goes crying to the cops or eats a bullet and leaves SR in his suicide note. <br /><br />I honestly see waterheads like him leading to the pull-down of this site long before the Alphabets come close.

				Call my cynical but ive been worried about SR since the day I found out about it. I was on sr maybe like 6months ago but never ordered anything just looked around....and if my memory serves me right there was half as many vendors/buyers on here especially the H section had maybe 2 listings now its got over 40 sometimes. Dont get me wrong thats great but I feel like its getting big now and with a place like this that usually means itll close down soon/get closed down by LE.......hey if the admin decides to make a new sr anytime in the future DONT LEAVE ME BEHIND!!!

				LE is too busy fighting artificial enemies and illegal immigration.&nbsp; &nbsp;they&#039;re too retarded to touch SR.&nbsp; plus there&#039;s always black market reloaded coming up.....<br /><br />SR is just the shot in the arm this failure of an economy amerika needs.
