				If I would believe this and wanted to experiment like this, then my only concern would be - how to know for sure I&#039;m getting 150ug and not 50ug or 100ug tabs? I am willing to pay premium price for the best stuff and to be sure I get what I pay for. And in the right dosage. Any ideas how to accomplish that?<br /><br />I copy-pasted the best parts (see the next post), but there is more to grasp.<br />http://www.psychedelic-library.org/staf5.htm<br />

				<br />COPY-PASTED BEST PARTS FROM ARTICLE:<br />Further implications for psychedelic learning techniques are evident in a subsidiary study made at the same college with a group of four students who were having difficulties with mathematics. They were not in the &quot;creative artist&quot; category, but were liberal arts majors who were frustrated because their abstract thinking processes seemed impeded. When they heard about the drugs course, one of them consulted the professor about the possibility of breaking a &quot;mathematics block&quot; through the use of LSD. A session was arranged for all four students, together with the guide and their mathematics teacher, who restated for them the fundamental concepts of calculus, which they had been unable to grasp in class. Under LSD each student found himself able to understand calculus, the reasoning behind it, why it was developed the way it was, and why it worked. They were elated about this breakthrough and had no difficulty with the thinking behind Taylor&#039;s theorem, integration, partial derivatives and analytical geometry. In the weeks following, although they were not transformed into brilliant mathematics students, it was clear that the &quot;block&quot; had been broken and that they were learning. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; It was a week before registration and it depressed me tremendously that I had not spent the summer learning German, as I had planned. I had intended to give myself a crash course so I could take second-year German, which I needed for my study in physics. I had heard of a woman who had learned enough Spanish in a few days, via LSD, to speak it fluently when she had to go to Mexico on business. I had taken LSD before, and while I couldn&#039;t see how she did this, I decided it was worth a try.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I hadn&#039;t even gotten around to picking up a textbook, but I did have a close friend who knew German well and who said he was willing to &quot;sit in&quot; while I took the drug and try to teach me the language. Fortunately, I knew something about conjugation and declension, so I wasn&#039;t completely at sea.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted to get worked up and feel involved with the language, as it seemed that this must be at least part of the key to the problem, so I asked my friend to tell me about Schiller and Goethe, and why the verb came at the end. Almost immediately, after just a story or two, I knew I had been missing a lot in ignoring the Germans, and I really got excited.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The thing that impressed me at first was the delicacy of the language (he was now giving me some simple words and phrases), and though I really messed it up, I was trying hard to imitate his pronunciation as I had never tried to mimic anything before. For most people German may be &quot;guttural,&quot; but for me it was light and lacey. Before long, I was catching on even to the umlauts. Things were speeding up like mad, and there were floods of associations. My friend had only to give me a German word, and almost immediately I knew what it was through cognates. It turned out that it wasn&#039;t even necessary for him to ask me what it sounded like.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Memory, of course, is a matter of association, and boy, was I ever linking up to things! I had no difficulty recalling words he had given me—in fact, I was eager to string them together. In a couple of hours after that I was reading even some simple German, and it all made sense.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The whole experience was an explosion of discoveries. Normally, when you&#039;ve been working on something for a long time and finally discover a solution, you get excited, and you can see implications everywhere. Much more than if you heard someone else discovering the same-thing. Now this discovery thing, that&#039;s what was happening with me—but all the time. The threshold of understanding was extremely low, so that with every new phrase I felt I was making major discoveries. When I was reading, it was as though I had discovered the Rosetta Stone and the world was waiting for my translation. Really wild! <br /><br /><br />Take [the drug] while typing and continue right through the transition period (where one&#039;s consciousness changes).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Now here is where &quot;will power&quot; comes in, as you will find yourself inventing a thousand reasons why typing is useless and you could not care less about learning it. It would be so pleasant to stop and listen to a little music or just meditate. Well, if you wish to accomplish something with psychedelics that lingers on into your ordinary state, you must exert an act of will. By doing nothing but letting that state direct you, a pleasant time will be had, but little accomplished.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore you must continue this regime... if possible up to fourteen hours....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It will feel as if you have been typing for centuries locked in a small enclosure with but one action to perform. When the drug wears off, go to sleep. It is almost guaranteed your mind will still be seeing numbers and letters, and your fingers will jerk as they wish to automatically respond to the actions required of them. Upon awakening, go back to the typewriter. You will be amazed to see your speed and accuracy greatly improved. A force will seem to grab your hands, and your fingers will fight to obey. The typewriter is now a permanent part of you, and the impression made can never be erased.

				You can always read reviews to get an idea of what strength they are, otherwise there isn&#039;t much you can really do without some really specialized, expensive equipment. I usually take four or five tabs (I like to trip very hard) and if it isn&#039;t enough, I&#039;ll take more. I usually wait thirty minutes to an hour to take more if I feel it necessary. Sometimes it takes a while to kick in though, so be careful if you decide to do this.

				i have taken lsd while having a small head cold twice now.<br /><br />each time i recognized that the infection was being localized to a single point within my one side of my sinuses.&nbsp; I began snorting and coughing when all of a sudden BAM some awful loogie containing that single point comes flying out of my mouth containing the sickness.&nbsp; After this I am cured.<br /><br />This happened TWICE.&nbsp; <br /><br />LSD can cure the common cold, says The Spegrodomous

				As great as that sounds, that&#039;s not how viruses and disease-causing bacteria actually work. You probably just started to feel better after being stopped up for a while and that coincided with your trip or the body high made you feel a little better until your symptoms subsided.

				No man I&#039;m pretty sure that LSD&#039;s cosmic energy vibrates on a level that cancels out dis-ease.<br /><br />How can you trust &quot;doctors&quot;? They&#039;re part of the conspiracy!<br /><br />But seriously I&#039;ve tripped a couple of times while sick, on one occasion all that happened was I became hyper aware of how sick my body was and that it just wanted to rest. It wasn&#039;t a bad trip, but if I&#039;d waited a week when I was healthy it would have been better.
