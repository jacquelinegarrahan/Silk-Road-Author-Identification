				Like that will keep men out and/or men from acting like women. So maybe this has been done before, but I haven&#039;t seen it exactly. What I think would be interesting, fun and stimulating for all SRF members, especially for the wonderful female members we have here. The &#039;sex on drugs&#039; thread was okay, but it seems more geared towards vulgar descriptions of man sex. I know females that are as dirty minded as men! Several&nbsp; I&#039;ve known were nice yet way dirtier minded than any man I&#039;ve known, but even those more - free spirited women had a softer - female touch to even their kinkier side -&nbsp; then men.<br /><br />All types of women - welcome! All shapes, sizes, ages, sexual orientations doesn&#039;t matter here! - all females are loved and welcome to come chat amongst yourselves. Please? Men need your help to be better men! I&#039;ll do my best to keep any rude men in line. I don&#039;t think women have ever been treated with the consideration and respect they earn from the moment they&#039;re born just by being how they - how YOU all are! I&#039;ve never met a woman that isn&#039;t the most interesting, loving and attractive woman there is to some good man. We&#039;re out here and we care what you have to say about this topic especially because it is a big deal to both sexes! <br /><br />People all over the world don&#039;t like talking about sex and life, yet it is the most basic activity and even the most basic necessity for man/woman. I watched the meth thread for the longest time and no one ever talked about sex. That&#039;s odd because I thought everyone did meth to have better sex on. Anyway, all the male female friends I&#039;ve ever known that love it - that&#039;s all they did it for! So I posted a longer version of these previous sentences here and finally got a few comments on sex, one real good one! but it seems modern society in the US anyway just aren&#039;t comfortable talking about sex in a logical and interesting way. &#039;Hey baby I want to fuck you with my real huge cock&#039; is not typically a good post when talking about sex and I&#039;ve seen that at the &#039;sex on drugs&#039; thread. Not that I&#039;ve never heard women talk that way, but only a few. They think - I think, lol - that people will think less of them for talking about sex or worse! Actually having sex openly! I was born without a jealous or possessive bone in my body so the topic is like taking a walk to me! (Thank you lady&#039;s!)<br /><br />I had a girl friend that lived her life in the Netherlands until 16 and I met her shortly after that. She had none of the shyness American females show on the topic of sex of any kind. For example, I asked her at an LSD bash we were having about a year after we met, if she thought that taking LSD made anal sex easier under the influence of it. The other girls at this party looked horrified at her wondering what she might say to such an honest question but on a topic rarely discussed at a party of mostly strangers. They all sat on the edge of their perches wondering what this European lady&nbsp; would say. She answered, &quot;who needs acid?&#039;&nbsp; I loved her more than ever for that simple honest response to what I felt should have been an appropriate topic anywhere - anal sex and drugs - shrug?. She&#039;s said and did many other things that I noticed were more uninhibited than her US counterparts acted and vocalized. Probably why there&#039;s fewer sex crimes in Europe and teen pregnancies because they are encouraged to talk about things that people do. Sex has always been taboo. That messes with men and women alike. <br /><br />We are wired to propagate. Males are pre-wired to be &quot;ON&quot; all the time! Men are that way by natures rules because females are responsible for the creative, loving and deeper thinking of our species rather than just rutting and reproducing for no reason! Not talking about these things is what causes men to be so inept so often at reading what a female is putting off when they say, act and do things. Men have a tendency to miss all those body language and olfactory images all women give off because they just need to get that sperm delivered! (What? You needed to get off too!?)<br /><br />Who ever designed that whole system for attraction between male and female humans for the purpose of procreation got it a bit off, wouldn&#039;t you agree? So it&#039;s kind of up to us more progressive and free thinking people to take up the slack in what needs to happen all the time, not just some of the time when a male and female (or female and female/male and male - what ever) join or meet. Too many times I&#039;ve heard from females that men just don&#039;t know how to satisfy them. Rarely did they voice this disappointment to the male they might have been talking about that time. <br /><br />Girls, ladies, females of all ages, experience, sexual orientation, all shapes and sizes - trust me someone (no doubt more than 1!) would love to love you! Would love to please you in every way! - please help all men to be better at knowing what it is you do like, love and what attracts you to them or anything! If you want men to act right, you&#039;re in a perfect position to teach them by doing things like I&#039;m suggesting here be done. Men can always use some intellect, especially from the female specifics; for how men should conduct themselves when in the company of a woman. Who men wish to respect properly and are attracted too. Or just understanding what you guys think so that men can be a better friend, brother and father, lover!<br /><br />Help men who read what you share here - hopefully - to know that what you think and say about this topic is how you want us guys (and gals who are in same sex relation-friendships) to act. So that you can feel free to voice those thoughts. Because men do really want to know. They may not even know it or are unable to admit, but all men wish to be better .... men! Encourage them to put that male ego away and accept that you they often know little to nothing about satisfying a woman. Drugs or no drugs! Give it a try ladies - men - then you get what you want&nbsp; from a man and men who think they know what a woman wants, really learn what a woman wants! What better place to do something like this - to teach guys WTF about real sex with a real female than in an anonymous thread. Like I said, I encourage you to make a quick fake ID to just chat here if you&#039;re worried about tarnishing your good name here in the forums and/or on The Road. Change it as often as you want to feel free to express yourselves! ! <br /><br />It can ALL be good and think what you&#039;ll get from sharing and think how many lame men that think that &#039;Wham-Bamn, Thank you Ma&#039;am&#039; is a real form of sex! Most of them were brought up that way. I have better hopes for after baby boomers generation parents. I mean most men of dating ages and more - half of them were brought up when there was no talk about sex in the family unit or in schools except with your closest friends. How are men or women supposed to know how to act if no one wants to talk about it!<br /><br />How about it girls! Candle lit dinner with a slow easy soak in the hot tub or sauna. Drugs in between - no drugs in between. What is in those beautiful minds of yours when you think of good sex - on or off drugs! Same sex - sex or hetero - both? - I&#039;ll try to keep men out of here and if you know they&#039;re men and saying anything to interrupt your &#039;Chi&#039;&nbsp; here-let me know and I&#039;ll take care of them!<br /><br />I want to know what you women think about this. Please? Or tell me where there is already a tread addressing female intimacy - I&#039;ll gladly close this thread and take your instructions! You see, I think all men - males - could be less offensive and better in bed or at least better at joining conversations in a respectful - even if naughty - way than they do, but just don&#039;t know how. I was lucky, I was surrounded by females and had zero male examples to give me good or bad examples of how to treat a lady correctly. So women ignored that I was even sitting there when they would talk amongst themselves about these things and I learned so much when they didn&#039;t think of a &#039;male&#039; listening. I feel so fortunate to have had that all female upbringing. (and no, not gay - hater or lover). I was blessed not having any male influence when all male influence was &#039;kickin ass and taken names&#039; mentality -&nbsp; to teach me ..... NOTHING! Lol! Instead I just kept my mouth shut all those informative years, surrounded by females and learned a total different world was out there - regarding intimacy, sex and desire - all according to females! And come on guys! You know damned well you want to make them happy~got to make them happy! Sorry Darwin, but that&#039;s what a males&#039; real job is in life. To make women happy! All of them!<br /><br />And guys, respect this thread and stay out of it for once! Read the posts and learn something. If you really have something positive to add, send it to one of the ladies posting in a Private message. Keep it nice or I&#039;ll be visiting you! If they answer you, kewl! If not just learn something valuable from the silence. Don&#039;t act like the dogs men seem to fall prey too acting like when they see, sense, smell the opposite sex and chase any ladies away.&nbsp; Please, Just because you have a dick doesn&#039;t automatically guarantee that you know shit about intimacy and how to act that pleases a woman. <br /><br />You ladies do it all the time! Teach the male population what REALLY turns you all on!

Imagine my surprise because I don&#039;t start threads. <br /><br />So your &#039;menarebetterthanwomen.isfuckedup.dude link - I though when I went there it was a play on words or someone being cleverly sarcastic, because I fucking love women! You can imagine my surprise when I read the 10 reasons why men are better than women there, and I did read them all - still believing there was going to be a punch line but finding none - shrug? I just couldn&#039;t get into your head of why would someone post that link in a thread that basically praises the existence of the female sex of Homo-sapiens? But I&#039;m not too bright so .......<br /><br />So I got another cup of Folders, slowly added my half n half to get lost in the swirling patterns of satin-ie creamy flash backs appearing on the small round screen of my coffee cup - and then read the 10 reasons men are better than women - again. I knew their had to be a punch line there, some where and that I would just go POP {that sound you can&#039;t hear when a thought appears rather quickly inside your mind - but you CAN hear it!} and that I would realize that person - you - were joking. <br /><br />But it&#039;s not a joke, is it? <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m more naive and/or stupid than I thought. That was horrible! Damned funny because many parts of it seems to fit, but I&#039;ll bet you women can or possibly already do - have a &#039;why women are smarter or better or what ever! - than men&#039;.&nbsp; I would think that&#039;s a joke too. I think you, me - we all can fit into those descriptions of male/female of our species and we can all have those types of idiosyncrasies and habits. I believe a man or a woman of minimal intelligence could read those aloud to one another or just by themselves and NOT be offended but laugh at each of the 10 reasons that were posted by this author at that link. Laughter is good and healing! So I&#039;ll leave it up for a bit to see what other (if any!) might say to it.<br /><br />Bottom line is (and I&#039;m still waiting to have the punch line dawn on me or for a PM to come to my inbox from you explaining to this stupid old hippy - that you were just kidding!) the 10 reasons listed there - while funny - caused an energy negative to thought and what I was hopping to cause with my prodding. They are a classic example of why women find men&#039;s MAN-NESS objectionable. If I were a woman reading those AND I had no since of humor or confidence in my abilities as a woman - I would probably be offended by that link.<br /><br />sigh .....<br /><br />but I shall leave it up and see if anyone else wants to add their input on the matter. But I don&#039;t really care for it as a staple for fodder in this thread. It&#039;s sorta the wrong direction (now friends, once I remember even posting this thread! lOl) for the female energy I&#039;d hoped to mix up here. Be nice Psyilly Siben<br /><br />Lets vote on it! All those in favor of leaving that post - say &quot;Aye!&quot; Those opposed - &quot;Neh&quot; .... or something like that. Where is Nugs n Time with you need them! Lol!<br />
