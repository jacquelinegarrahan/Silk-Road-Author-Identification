				Yeah, bad vibes indeed. Not helped by the RC busts, TFM, speculation about certain vendors.<br /><br />I can&#039;t help but feel that user&#039;s attitudes to using SilkRoad have changed over the past couple of months and this has crept into the forums. When I joined 12 months ago, the majority of users seemed to exercise a healthy balance of personal security and common sense. This seems to have morphed into an admix of naivety and paranoia. For example a large number of users are happy to give their name and address to any new vendor touting samples, or use clearly shady vendors for the bulk of their purchases. At the same time, any legitimate complaints or concerns (poor packaging, bad vendor behavior, reports of buyers being raided) are brushed off as lies, LE, jealous competition etc. It seems much harder to determine who&#039;s legitimate, and even harder to raise any concerns without getting shot down by a hoard of posters who don&#039;t seem to have any reason to be so hostile . Not sure where I&#039;m going with all this, smoking bud this early in the afternoon has got me in rambling mode&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Spend the rest of the week posting positive things, we may as well make this community a nice place to be while is lasts ;D<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ip96WSwyM

				Only dark days for people who were actually affected by it. Requiring FE is shady as fuck, this isn&#039;t the first time it happened and it won&#039;t be the last, some people just never learn until it happens to them. And if you FE and plan on sticking around here for a while, it will happen to you. <br /><br />If tony did indeed scam all of those people, they should be more angry with themselves. This community as a whole would be a much happier, better place if buyers stopped putting up with the finalize early crap. The scams would stop and the anger would go with it. This site is nothing short of a godsend, and what I would call one of the greatest innovations of the last 2 decades. If people would stop being so naive the scammers would have nothing to work with, and this place would flourish beyond what anyone could imagine. <br /><br />It sucks that so many people lost money on this and had their trust betrayed, but people go to prison, have their lives completely ruined and are even killed over this shit. If there is one aspect of your lives you should exercise some damn caution about it is the business you conduct on here. The community as a whole will be made better for it.

				I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;m one of the people that&#039;s probably contributing to that bad vibe. It just sucks watching this guy make out with probably $100,000 and we have to sit back and watch it happen because we were foolish enough to finalize early for everything. I imagine that by the end of the week once it&#039;s clear that he&#039;s not coming back, everyone will start to settle down again and leave the past behind, because it&#039;s not worth staying angry over for months. We got screwed by some heroin dealer. Who hasn&#039;t been screwed IRL? But yeah, I&#039;m definitely already starting to calm down a bit, and I&#039;m sure the rest of the forum will follow suit eventually. It&#039;s not easy watching the #1 vendor turn out to be a scammer, but it&#039;s the risk we took. Time to let it go.<br /><br />Unless of course he really does up out of the blue. Then I guarantee that the mood of this entire forum will flip upside down within the hour. But let&#039;s be realistic here.

				You are probs right Uniwiz. <br /><br />And yes... Asshat and it&#039;s plural Asshats is an excellent word. :P<br /><br />@ DC - Yeah if that Tony fella is what people are saying he is then it&#039;s going to be tense for a while.

				I haven&#039;t had good experiences on SR...<br />My first purchase was a scam, Obamagirl got me for about ~250$, and then I ordered from some reputable vendors, but they never showed to my P.O. box, so i think that&#039;s been flagged. I&#039;m also thinking my home address is flagged because people are receiving their orders from a Canadian vendors in 7days max, and im on day 13.<br />I had one reship come in to a friends address. I&#039;ve been trying to convince him to let me send another package to his house, but hes super sketch about it cus he lives with his parents. <br /><br />The forums have been good to help me learn more, vent my frustrations. But i can see things looking dark, but i think it&#039;ll pass.<br /><br />

It just sucks watching this guy make out with probably $100,000 and we have to sit back and watch it happen because we were foolish enough to finalize early for everything. I imagine that by the end of the week once it&#039;s clear that he&#039;s not coming back, everyone will start to settle down again and leave the past behind, because it&#039;s not worth staying angry over for months. We got screwed by some heroin dealer. Who hasn&#039;t been screwed IRL? But yeah, I&#039;m definitely already starting to calm down a bit, and I&#039;m sure the rest of the forum will follow suit eventually. It&#039;s not easy watching the #1 vendor turn out to be a scammer, but it&#039;s the risk we took. Time to let it go.<br /><br />Unless of course he really does up out of the blue. Then I guarantee that the mood of this entire forum will flip upside down within the hour. But let&#039;s be realistic here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Did you manage to sort things out regarding the people you got mixed up with?

I know that some sellers depend on early finalization and it will become much harder for them to make their case if someone as reputable as tony just disappears like this. The value of reputation in taking a hard blow.<br />There will be tension in the forums and some sellers may not be able to move product as quickly; some may leave entirely. Either way the Road will prevail because there is nothing out there as good as this. <br /><br />I put down more money than my last&nbsp; ~6 purchases combined on my only FE order ever. Even if tony follows through, it will be difficult to put myself through this again. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s others in my boat.<br /><br />Happy travels<br /><br />~whirl

Should be tribal! I recommend everyone go there if you are in London. I normally send in a couple of minions to push Meph when I go and I just fuck off and party while they do the work. It&#039;s a beautiful system! :D<br /><br />And the MDA is still getting cooked. There was some delays in the process, not through faults in the chemistry but some other shit had to be dealt with. I will be getting it on there asap. <br /><br />Will be £30 a g/£580 an oz + postage (depending on what shipping you want) and oh yeah...before I forget...NO FUCKING FE! ;)<br /><br />
