				Hello, I am researcher doing a study on the psychedelic compound Psilocybin and due to failing to obtain a DEA license to preform my research in a legal manner I have decided to do it illegally. So of course I have limited funding and resources. So If you think you can help in any way or if you are interested in my research and would like to know more please contact me here on the forums. I am in great need of trip reports (please use as much detail as possible and include dosage) I also accept donations any amount helps you can send donations here 16RgNnNc5H2ESEuxJJqe9CgDFFpUkEHeaY If you would like to donate lab equipment I am in need of new glassware. Anything helps really even if its just helpful information or a trip report and please feel free to ask questions. Thanks

				I suppose I should give you more information on my research and why I am doing it. Two years ago my wife was diagnosed with a severe form of treatment-resistant depression after we had tried basically every antidepressant medication known. So her doctor basically prescribed her Desoxyn and told her that if this didn&#039;t work nothing else will. If you don&#039;t already know what Desoxyn is its basically Methamphetamine pills. After a few weeks of her taking it I could tell it wasn&#039;t working and around a month later she hung herself. So after my wife&#039;s suicide I made a vow to myself that I would try to find a effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression so I could help people who don&#039;t. I am not looking for your sympathy I just thought it may give you a better understanding of the seriousness of this form of depression and my motives behind this study. Anyway I eventually came across evidence on the antidepressive effects of psilocybin. I understand if you don&#039;t want to donate money or equipment but is it too much to ask for trip reports and information. Just information itself can make a huge impact on my research I watched my wife slowly drive herself to suicide because of this damn illness.<br />So please at least submit a trip report.

				I&#039;m not doing a full on trip report for the SR forums but I would highly agree that mushroom trips have a lasting effect on your general perception of things.&nbsp; For the better, of course!<br /><br />I have had some dark times where a good handful of mushrooms snaps me right out of it and effects seem to last weeks if not months on the headspace.&nbsp; Could go the other way around in the wrong environment of course.&nbsp; I think for these types of treatments (all psychedelics including MDMA, LSD etc) that a medically trained, experienced (done the drugs, knows the effects) person is needed more than a clinical environment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the idea of tripping with a bunch of medical personnel &#039;watching&#039; over me, bad trip anyone?
