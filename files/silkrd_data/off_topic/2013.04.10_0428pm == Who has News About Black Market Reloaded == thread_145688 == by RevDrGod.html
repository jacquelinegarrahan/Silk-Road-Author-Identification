				I made an account there a while ago just to check it out. I am assuming that most people here don&#039;t surf between sites. Just stick to one or the other. <br /><br />Some vendors may know though. I have seen some vendors at the road have vending accounts at BMR as well. SR is superior to BMR in my opinion anyway...
