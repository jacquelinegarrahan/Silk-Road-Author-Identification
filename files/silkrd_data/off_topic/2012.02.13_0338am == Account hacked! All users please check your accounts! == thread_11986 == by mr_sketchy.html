				Hi<br /><br />I just logged into my account to see there was $6 missing. I have made no orders recently and there was no record of it in my transactions.<br /><br />I wrote an email to SR staff, and when it said my email was sent, my account was short another 50 cents! in a spate of 2 minutes!<br /><br />How bizzare! But no record of it in my transactions!<br /><br />You may all want to withdraw your funds to a safe spot in the meawhile.

				One post is more than good enough, please refrain from spamming EVERY board.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11985.0<br /><br />And as I said, are you sure it&#039;s not bitcoins changing in price. Verify that you are losing ACTUAL bitcoins, and not just USD value.

				Man, an irrational part of me took over for about a minute after reading his post. I actually headed over to SR to withdraw funds just in case, then stopped myself because I realized that this clown was probably just being naive or stupid. Good thing for me I didn&#039;t transfer, getting them back would have been a hassle.

				Ok everyone<br /><br />I sincerely apologize. massive F**k up on my part.<br /><br />In all honesty, Im not sure why I had such a massive brain fart!<br /><br />All is well, and you need not worry about your accounts.<br /><br />There is a long winded set of circumstances which led me to believe my account had been compromised. Im not going to write an epic post detailing it, and sadly, no, I was not high! lmao<br /><br />So my apologies for the false alarm, jumping the gun and unnecessarily alarming the community.<br /><br />Get high, or stay high folks!
