				Okay, so i apologize for living under a rock...but im just now hearing about Atlantis.<br /><br />As a curious fellow, i made an account there to check it out and all i can say is. &quot; i&#039;m a little impressed... &quot; <br /><br />I mean, the website itself, is a clean, well laid out website. ( their prices are a bit shitty in comparison to what i see hear. )<br /><br />But in a general feel i like how the website looks, and basically from what im hearing is that its the only real competition to SR.<br /><br /><br />What are your thoughts and comments about it? <br />Do you buy on both sites? or just here on SR?<br /><br /><br />( I personally will always use SR because they&#039;ve been good to me for the past few years, and its only fair that i stick with them till the bitter end )

				I think that the main thing is that it lacks security and draws alot of unwanted attention through being VERY public.&nbsp; They made a youtube ad to promote themselves, and had a session with a group of reporters to promote their site when it came out.&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember every questionable thing that they&#039;ve done, but the bottom line is that their security isn&#039;t up to par with SR and they just cropped up so people think that it could be a government operation.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that alot of vendors from SR are on Atlantis, but the prices don&#039;t really differ even though their commission is alot lower.&nbsp; <br /><br />Their forums are also pretty highly censored (or were when I looked) and their management is pretty questionably immature and devious...&nbsp; I would wait a while to use Atlantis if you are looking to use it.&nbsp; It seems alot more bright and nice looking than SR, but there is basically no trust basis in my opinon :)<br /><br />

				Yea, thats the kind of vibe i got. they are WAY TOO LOUD. <br />I mean, i understand their tactic &quot; BE LOUD, GET CUSTOMERS, WITH AN IDGAF ABOUT LE &quot; Kind of attitude.<br />It&#039;s definitely a weird way to start a market, and it would be sensible if the site was run be LE.<br />I mean...the site looks really nice...and i mean, that alone just has me questioning &quot; who funded all of this...cause it sure as shit wouldnt be cheap to make a commercial like that, and then be so careless as to actually talk to reporters...&quot; Which in my mind totally agrees with you, that Atlantis could be a Government run sting program to catch Vendors...<br /><br /><br />I of course, will be sticking to SilkRoad, i never intend to leave this lovely community.<br />Because the amount of professionalism and site&#039;s consumer base, is just one noone can compete with.<br />This place is filled with so many amazing people, and such good products and customer service, i dont see why anyone would want to leave this place.<br /><br />I give Atlantis a year before they end up like the Farmer&#039;s market. And i give it 6 months at the earliest before arrests start happening due to their lack of security like you mentioned.

				I read a long forum discussion between several Atlantis vendors, most of whom were also vendors on SR. The concensus seemed to be that even though Atlantis prices were often lower than those on SR, vendors were barely getting enough Atlantis sales to make it worth their while. However most were happy with the general Atlantis set up and were prepared to continue selling there in the hope that sales would increase as more people got to know about the site. When I visited, all the prices were in US$, giving the impression that the site was mainly targetted at the 4.5% of the world&#039;s population who live in the USA.<br /><br />Whilst on the subject of other markets, I&#039;d be interested to hear of buyers&#039; experiences using RAMP, the Russian Anonymous MarketPlace.

				Yea...i dont know...It just seems to me like this would be something the DEA would do...I mean...in my eyes that seems like a viable strategy <br />&quot; If we cant get to them....Lets get them to come to us... &quot; <br />And since you mentioned that it was all listed in USD. Either way, im staying away from Atlantis and any other markets. SR is the only place i trust.<br />

I am just happy to have a place like this.&nbsp; I have too much respect for DPR and really have no need at all to switch markets, even for minimal risk.&nbsp; I can see the financial decision to switch, but from a buyer&#039;s standpoint it is just a movement to a questionable website with very little reviews for each vendor and no sense of community :/&nbsp; To me, even if it isn&#039;t a scam, they come off as a big business trying to plow the local guy.&nbsp; &lt;-- I don&#039;t like this.&nbsp; Frankly, I will stick with with SR until it cannot run any longer because it is the only thing on the darknet that I actually trust.

				Very simple answer is people.... SR has the people. I am somewhat new and have looked at other places but SR has the vendors and customers to talk to and answer question. People here want to help I mean sure you have trollers but c&#039;mon now when don&#039;t you? I enjoy it here and learn a lot from all of you... most of you...

				A third one exists, which is named Black Market Reloaded. <br /><br />It&#039;s important to know about alternatives, because monopoly doesn&#039;t sound right under anarchy.<br /><br />I stay sticked to the Road, but i like to know i could go somewhere else when needed for any reason.

				This is an interesting subject- but the bottom line is on SR there is a huge volume and huge community on the forums and alot of good info ( some batshit people - but thats just icing on the cake) if you look @ Atl forum- its empty and the posts are stale- no community - also the sales volume quoted in the forbe&#039;s article was something like 7 figures plus monthly for SR and Atl has just reached the mid 6 figures in its history- another thing i noticed in regard the security of Atl is that a very knowledgeable member of these forums made several posts on their forum with helpful suggestions and even offered to help personally to improve thier security methodology and was kind of brushed off by the mods- so the actual tradecraft of cyber security is looked at differently- <br />i cannot speak from personal experience how the vendors differ- but it is my understanding some vendors offer on both sites, but again i dont think the volume is there to make it profitable- but what do i know- Also when the forbes article comes out - will it bring more traffic to Atl and BMR? time will tell- but ultimately i thin that healthy competition is good for everybody- lower prices and pressure to provide the best service- but like i said IMO this is an interesting subject

YouTube video + publicity, I think it&#039;s fair to say they see Silk Road as the Website with &quot;Target No1&quot; written on it&#039;s back and so can afford to be the little brother LE wont bother wasting resources on just yet, They needed to bring in customers somehow as well as get their name out there. Obviously there is not going to be any new gawker articles proclaiming how you can buy drugs on the internet with bitcoin so they had to make their mark in some way and get the worlds attention. I guess YouTube was that avenue. <br /><br />It seemed to work as my sales increased significantly after the buzz surrounding that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Re forum. I&#039;ve not seen moderation in my time but for sure they do delete posts that have no relevance/spammy, for example IIRC the equivalent to the SR &quot;spare coins thread&quot; was removed so not to encourage begging, Not sure why as it&#039;s harmless enough but they seem to run a tougher line.<br /><br />Traffic is picking up there lately but I still wish there was more. To be honest I&#039;m still not sure which site is best, To my surprise I actually encountered more scammers PMing me and claiming non delivery since I setup shop on SR. Hopefully that changes with the new feedback system DPR is implementing but whether it&#039;s the tougher overall line with spam/scammers on atlantis or the fact their feedback system is harder to game I&#039;ve had an easier time selling there for sure but not enough traffic.<br /><br />That&#039;s my 2 bitcents
