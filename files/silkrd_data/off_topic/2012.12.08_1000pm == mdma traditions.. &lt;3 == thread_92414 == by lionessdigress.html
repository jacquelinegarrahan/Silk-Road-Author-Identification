				okay, so i can&#039;t really say that i have a d.o.c., because i love all, indiscriminately... but there&#039;s something about that molly.&nbsp; :-* <br /><br />mdma is the one drug that i go the extra mile for when it comes to preparing (mentally and physically) for and making sure my setting is perfect. i used to frequent raves quite often. i liked the hyper-stimulation at them-- the lights, the weird people, the loud music (oh, especially when i was able to get myself sitting on top of a speaker! mmm). i guess the novelty of them wore off pretty quickly, though i do crave one every once in a while, and i realized i was only going to them to obtain my drugs. disliked the people and realized i preferred to enjoy my mdma in other places. i was becoming increasingly exasperated because not only did i not want to be at a rave, but i couldn&#039;t even find good drugs at them anymore! <br /><br />i&#039;m excited that i have found the silk road, as i can now have a safe and reliable vendor to buy from without needing to drive into an unsafe area of my city to be ripped off by some random scrub raver. i never wanted a physical drug dealer for these kinds of drugs, so this website really is my personal utopia!<br /><br />i digress.<br /><br />so now i have one gram of domesticdude&#039;s mdma heading to me. i ordered on december 5th and am hoping i get it by friday. in the meantime, i have been preparing for the roll of the year with my girlfriend. the last time we used mdma together was last november. she is not a user, once a year is sufficient. i am more inclined, but haven&#039;t rolled since september 15th... and before that, july 3rd... which is a good amount of time in my opinion, considering i used to use every weekend from september 2010 until march 2011. after that i slowed down to once a month or so, until may 2012, when it became once every three months. <br />tl;dr - i think i have waited an adequate amount of time since my last roll and that my non-drug using girlfriend and i will be on the same level when we take this mdma. (which i am sure is going to be much purer than anything we&#039;ve ever had.)<br /><br />sidenote: recommendation on attack dose and booster amounts? i was thinking 150mg each with 75mg boosters an hour and a half after initial dosing. what do you think?<br /><br />since i am waiting, i&#039;ve begun compiling all that is needed for us to have an epic night. we are each taking st. john&#039;s wort and 100mg of 5-htp a day for two weeks before the roll. two days before we will stop taking both, so that they do not diminish the roll at all. we will post-load with 200mg of 5-htp when we are coming down.<br /><br />we eat relatively healthy, but i will make sure that we do vegetable juices a few days building into &quot;d-day&quot;. something nice and healthy to eat before we drop, which i&#039;d like to do around 6pm. i will also be juicing fresh grapefruit juice to drink during the roll. it REALLY IS amazing and spikes you up when you are dropping a bit... if you haven&#039;t had FRESH grapefruit juice, try to! you can taste the difference, 100%.<br /><br />i bought 25 glowsticks off of amazon for us to do as we please with them. i wish that one of us was capable of lightshows, but we aren&#039;t-- one of the ONLY things i miss about raves! but anyway, a bunch of sticks will be in the bathtub with us, lighting up the bubbles i am going to use. incense will fragrant the air and candles will light up the bathroom.<br /><br />when we get out of the bath, i assume we will be starting to come up. time for oil on the bodies (helping one another, of course), soft bathrobes, and menthol lotion on the feet before the fuzzy socks go on! <br /><br />after that, it&#039;s time for nature to run its course. we have a blacklight and a strobe. i am going to connect my mac to the tv for visualizer purposes, but my itunes doesn&#039;t have such great music on it to go with the situation. any recommendations of mixes on soundcloud that i can download would be GREATLY appreciated. any suggestions for music sites in general? let me know!<br /><br />plenty of soft blankets to roll in, a big fluffy cat and gooey stuff from the toy store to play with, maybe even some body painting. we will have whipped cream, lollipops, gum, and maybe even some poprocks! pacifiers in case of severe clenching, pot, and a pack of newports. she has a small studio space set up in the house with a decent soundsystem, a keyboard, and a synthesizer that we can play with. i think we&#039;re going to have a blast!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />any other suggestions? what do you do to get ready for your mdma sessions!?

				The only thing I do is to make sure I fast on the day I plan to roll.&nbsp; No need to make things complicated but whatever works for you.&nbsp; Give me some molly and lock me in a closet and I bet you I will have an amazing time in there lol

				I can&#039;t say from myself that I&#039;m as experienced with MDMA as you are, but when I prepare for a roll it&#039;s most likely the morning or afternoon before the roll when the preparations start.<br />I get all my tasks done, like tidying my flat, washing all the stuff up so everything will be super clean and awesome in the morning. Then I call my parents, have a nice talk to them, which I do to rarely - prolly like all of you too! I never roll alone, IMO that would be the total wrong use of MDMA. Anyways after having all that stuff done I get 2 bottles of orange juice and then move to my mate.<br />The rest what happens is written in the stars :D

				I don&#039;t really buy into pre-loading / post-loading (all that much). I eat well and take vitamins anyway and have never felt any worse after using MDMA than I would otherwise, nor have I noticed any benefit when I have tried to pre/post-load.<br />There&#039;s not much science to support it, at least not properly tested, and contradictory opinions. 5-HTP for example, when taken before you&#039;ve fully come down could cause serotonin syndrome. However, since loads of people do this and have not experienced serotonin syndrome it may suggest that 5-HTP does little.<br /><br />MDMA is a substance which gives very varied and subjective experiences at the same dosage. So if you think popping supplements for weeks will make you roll harder, perhaps you will.

				Any one of you taken a 1mg/kg dose? It&#039;s not for partying, that dose. But take it with a couple friends, hang out, maybe go out and walk around (don&#039;t drive), go to a bar maybe with a group of you like that...<br /><br />I highly recommend trying it.

If I can&#039;t manage to get that together for Christmas, I&#039;ll hold off because it is so much better with people to share the experience with. I don&#039;t feel like partying either though, not on that dose. It is a much more relaxed dose. It doesn&#039;t fill you up with energy, it doesn&#039;t make you have to dance around... it makes food taste awesome, unless I&#039;m just remembering my most recent baked-brownie bake, too.<br /><br />And in my case, it enhances my peripheral vision to the point where I can enjoy nature in an almost spiritual-way. I honestly think a 1mg/kg dose of MDMA will most likely be the best way, for me at least, to hippie-flip, should I ever hippie-flip.... and that is because it doesn&#039;t fill me with energy, because it just feels like perfection, like everything is perfect... It gives the perfect mindset.

Love the feeling and visuals I get off of it and it&#039;s just not possible to get that effect on a normal dose. Either that or I dance the whole night which ever I&#039;m in the mood for...It does get hard to dance on that much mdma but I just take a break then start right back up. The only real issues I ran into while doing this is dehydration and overheating so be careful if you ever decide to try it. I&#039;ve been doing this since my teens and I&#039;m in my mid 30&#039;s now, I haven&#039;t noticed any major effects from it, tbh. I don&#039;t recommend people start eating grams but that&#039;s how we always did it over here.

				Excellent. Love to read stuff like this.<br /><br />SO my fave and I recommend to everyone next time they roll.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;CALLED ICE TOWEL&quot; OR &quot;ICE TURBAN&quot;<br /><br />Take a towel...... Drench in cold water.....Lay it folded up.... (1ft wide by 2ft long)........Put in freezer for 20-30 mins. <br /><br />it will come out HARD as A Rock. You wonht even be able to bend it for 5-10 mins. Put that directly over your head like a Turban. Enjoy.<br /><br />Perfect when you need to cool down, or just enjoy the coldness goodness.<br /><br />This is my ritual!!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />and another thing....... <br /><br />DO the same thing. with the towel.... then rub Vapor Vicks Rub...... all over it..........Then ask your friend if they want to get Assassinated....??<br /><br />The let them to sit in the chair....... tell them to close their eye&#039;s........ Then you sneak up and stand from behind the chair and take the frozen/Vicks towel and Pretend like you are trying to suffocate them them... ( Be nice, Covering their FACE&gt;&gt;&gt; forehead, eyes, mouth, and chin......And pulling back..... both ends of the towel backwards ...with your both hands toward yourself...... covering their face...... Like your are trying to suffocate them... &gt;&gt;&gt; BE GENTLE....But you get the point.... TELL THEM TO INHALE...... The coldness/Vicks rub..... That WILL make them Blow Up....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They call me the&nbsp; &quot;ASSASSIN&quot; at the house..... My eyes solid black, and I just sneak up on people with the ICE RAG...... People LOVE IT...... IM GENTLE TOO&gt;.....

				In response to your light show desire, please do remember that Youtube is your friend. Get a big screen TV, put a light show from Youtube up on it and sit close! Black out everything else; all you&#039;ll see are miraculous, impossible finger dances of beauty and awesome.<br /><br />Another thing to watch would be GoPro&#039;s Hero3 promo video, as well as Devinsupertramp&#039;s Now Or Never. They are both amazing in music as well as visuals! Trust me :)<br /><br />Also, you could watch Tomorrowland sets. You&#039;ll feel like you&#039;re right there with them partying!

Please read the thread I made about it and maybe comment if you have anything to add:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92401.0<br /><br />Brief(ish) version:<br />Tried MDMA for the first time (not certain on the amount, but could&#039;ve been anywhere from say 400-700mg, maybe more)<br />Felt amazing, had an awesome time. I was in a different world, an absolute &quot;next level&quot; (but also had some strange &quot;negative&quot; side effects (that were actually quite interesting)).<br />Got home, researched lots about MDMA, figured that the crystal I had taken must&#039;ve been weak/cut after everybody saying ~125mg is the &quot;sweet spot&quot;.<br />Bought some MDMA from here from a vendor with a great reputation.<br />Went to a gig/rave, took 150mg + 50mg booster... felt NOWHERE NEAR as close to how I felt the first time.<br /><br />After discussing it a bit, I think I&#039;m also on the same boat as you. While taking high dosages might be irresponsible for health and safety... it&#039;s just how I think I&#039;ll enjoy taking my MDMA. I want to be in a totally different, mind-blowing trippy world - almost feeling like a completely new person, rather than just feeling like the same old me but with slightly added empathy.

				Just wanted to let OP know that it sounds like a great plan. Thanks for sharing. Half the experience (of drugs) is the anticipation so you have full appreciation. I don&#039;t agree with the posters who just want to hero-dose loads of MDMA and fry their brains chasing the dragon. Missing the point, and reducing the possibility of future enjoyment. Also shows no understanding of the pharmacology.
