				I do Krav Maga.<br /><br />it can be done of people at almost any fitness level. Is great for beginners. And teaches you to fuck people up in the shortest amount of time possible (including group fights, fighting armed people etc)<br /><br />I highly recommend Krav Maga to anyone looking at getting into martial arts for self defense<br /><br />Mossad can&#039;t be wrong!

				Awesome, I have heard good things about Krav Maga and Brazilian jiu jitsu. I practice old school karate from Okinawa. Unfortunately most karate has become watered down these days, mostly because of sport karate. Ill have my blackbelt by the end of the summer cant wait! Oh ya and muy thai is pretty awesome too. I think the best way to defend yourself in any situation is to know about all the pressure points, its the only way to take down someone thats a lot bigger than you. Anybody here ever heard of Choki Motubu? Wikipedia him if you havent, fucking badass.

It is not the usual drunk guy in a bar that really poses a problem, it is a person that has some kind of training in real dangerous methods. <br /><br />Anyway the better style is no style (in Bruce Lee&#039;s docet). If for example you learn boxing for arms/stance, karate/TKD for legs and JJ (or similar) for groundwork you become much better than whatever style you can practice by itself.

				blend some chinese drunken boxing with some capoiera and you will be untouchable. I also always wanted to know combat ready tai chi.

You sound like you believe in chi, Im fascinated by the concept and have heard various theories on it. Some believe it is just the bio electrical energy we have running through us. Not a science guy though so I dont know for sure. I tend to believe its all about the points, pressure points that is. That I found through some training and research is really how the old masters used to make people look plain silly. Knowing which points to strike, how to strike, which are kills and which are stuns, all good stuff to know.
