				I&#039;d also be interested in responses, other than &quot;selling drugs&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stick to buying and consuming.&nbsp; ;D<br />My job gives me shitty hours, and it&#039;d be awesome to make some extra cash somehow.

				Tutoring is a good way of making extra cash if you are qualified in something or can play an instrument to a good standard. Don&#039;t know where you are in the world but in the UK charging £20 to 25 an hour for tutoring is about average and you generally do it in the evenings or weekends. I did it a couple of years ago and it added about £300 to my monthly income and did it as a cash job so no tax etc.<br /><br />I pay for my weekly weed bill by day trading BTC but it means that some weeks I don&#039;t get to smoke. I make about £40 a week by trading on fairly predictable cycles without a great deal of effort.<br /><br />Don&#039;t discount selling drugs altogether, you can make a reasonable amount by selling to a very small group of people. A small scrog grow on a 5-6 week cycle can net you a few hundred profit, as can a monotub mushroom grow- again at about a 5 week cycle. If you have a big garden and ignorant or liberal neighbours then an outdoor grow is incredibly easy and it&#039;s literally money for nothing. A friend sells fairly small amounts of MDMA (1/2 oz a week) which nets him about 240 profit per week.

				Buy adderall dirt cheap from your friends, some people don&#039;t know what it&#039;s worth. So many people seem to have adhd it&#039;s not hard at all to find them. Just resell it at a 20% markup, and there ya go, tons of drug money. The only catch is that you risk getting butt-raped in prison, but who cares! ::)

				if you have friends/ people you trust who deal already locally, you can always middle man between vendors on sr and them- either buying or selling.<br /><br />usually the friend will give a percent of the profit to the person who sets up the deal. or make a &#039;drink&#039; and add your own percent either way.<br /><br />technically your not dealing and if you have friends who are involved enough you can make some good effortless money.
