				We all know everyone is somewhat hypocritical in one way or another, even I. I just hate the hypocrisy amongst people who use drugs (not everyone, but you get those people) -- anyway, what is my point? So today a classmate of mine (not a friend) found out I do cocaine from time to time (don&#039;t know how, maybe someone else saw me doing it one day at a party and told her), and blabber mouthed it all to the whole classroom calling me a &#039;druggie&#039; (when in actually I only do coke before an exam (for concentration and energy), in a party or on social occasions from time to time) and now every f*cking teacher looks at me like I&#039;m sort of scum of the earth (I just hate those f*cking looks they give me now), when in fact she smokes weed more than any person I know of (has no medical condition). The f*ck? I don&#039;t want to seem like I care what other people think of me using from time to time, but seriously when did it become so morally wrong to do cocaine? It&#039;s not like I&#039;m distributing it, giving out to those who can&#039;t consent (children or animals), It&#039;s for personal use, not like I&#039;m a junkie looking for a fix everyday, going out of my way stealing or mugging people, I earn money and spend it how I want, how it seems fit for me. I know it influences organized crime more than weed or any other drug I know of, but war on drugs is total bullshit any way you put it.<br /><br />Sure one might be more toxic than the other, I just don&#039;t get the fact why people tend to demonize people who do cocaine, LSD, etc. (I&#039;m talking about powder cocaine, not crack cocaine). My belief is a person should consume whatever he wants as long as it doesn&#039;t interfere with other peoples lives. <br /><br />I just wanted to see what&#039;s your view on this?

				You are right.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people validate their own hypocracy by looking down at others.&nbsp; I would ignore those people.&nbsp; They are dangerous anyhow.&nbsp; &nbsp;Distance yourself .&nbsp; <br />

				crack cocaine (base cocaine) is the same as powder just roa is different. like heroin base aka no3 and heroin salt aka no4. smoked cocaine - shorter halflife than snorted or iv&#039;ed same with heroin.. i hate when people look at me this way too because they know i do drugs kinda just want to pick up a hammer and break their skull.. Nothing you can do about it though maybe just annoy that dumb bitch that she&#039;s pothead, smoked her brain away, drug addict, scum of the earth and something like that.<br /><br />and this war on drugs is not your war if you don&#039;t want to &quot;fight&quot; it .

				Some good advice here, all of it. @ murder, it&#039;s not easy to get straight As at college so kudos to you. I ususally don&#039;t sleep with teachers as a rule and as a result still haven&#039;t got my first straight A, and anything less gets to me. <br /><br />But with this teacher, she can&#039;t just look down her nose at you Robin, thats a problem needs fixing.

				To OP:&nbsp; Shake it off everyone is gonna judge its human nature.&nbsp; Even if this girl smokes pot or w/e people that are uninformed or inexperienced with drugs are always gonna think of the worse case scenario.&nbsp; When ignorant people hear cocaine use they automatically think your some sort of sick addict when in reality your a recreational user.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dont knock it till you try it, how else you gonna know what gets your rocks off.&nbsp; Do what you want and fuck the haters.&nbsp;

				You have go to be kidding about &quot;looking down on crack cocaine&quot; while you do &quot;cocaine&quot; you realize this is the same drug right?<br /><br />here&#039;s a tip, don&#039;t judge and let people pick their own poisons. Addiction is a scary thing on any drug and not everyone will find themselves on the path of addiction from small casual use.
