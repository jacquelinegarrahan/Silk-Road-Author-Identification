				Thank you Ballzinator, thought I was high on 2C-B for a second there. 2C-B isn&#039;t even remotely like ketamine, they&#039;re in a completely different class from one another. If I had to describe the effects of 2C-B, it would be as a cross between LSD and MDMA. How is that in any way similar to the dissociative properties of ketamine?! <br /><br />

In fact, I have to be careful how I sit or it&#039;ll give me a backache (taking magnesium helps, too), and I gave myself a pretty good headache once by drinking during the comedown.

				Mixed up posts now. Anyway, this thing about 2C-B being analgesic.<br />When we were flying me and BF did not remember how we managed to get cuts and bruises all over and did not realize during the trip at all.<br />We both could not move the next day. There was a lot of broken glass on the floor and my legs looked as if had been flogged all over. Buddy looked the same and although he had no more than 15mg he too could not remember how we ended up black and blue.<br />I am glad that I once again got wasted royally as I used to when I was younger.<br />I took so much because the 1st time I had 2C-B I needed 50mg to get only a quarter of the trip I experienced now.<br />

The come up is nice and fast, get a little rush off it most the time pretty quick. Personally I&#039;d start small and bump up every half hour or so to get where you want to go. Railing 50mg to the brain is likely to take you somewhere a little less fun than you were looking to go. I&#039;ve been using nawlings (sp?) 2CB mostly and 10mg snorted is a light buzz, 20mg a decent little high, 25+mg pretty damn visual. Hope that helps.

				2C-B is def a hallucinogen - I like the lower amounts (18-20 mg); I&#039;ve taken some 28mg doses (orally) and felt queasy, really queasy for about an hour. Both dosages seemed to have the same &quot;cartooning&quot; effect, and both were done in about 5 hours. Just don&#039;t drive on it - the colors don&#039;t mach up with the lines of anything. Going out with friends to a bar or coffeeshop is fun with 2C-B.

				For our group of 10 we found with 2c-b that oral doses need to be double amount snorted for same effects. We have worked our way up from 10mg orally and after 4-5 trips we tried snorting and all but one of us agree that while it burns its VERY worth it :)<br /><br />Few things we have learned:<br /><br />Snorting hurts but oral takes 2.5-3hrs before full effects vs 15 mins with peak and duration staying same.<br /><br />25mg snorted / 50mg oral seems to be a nice amount, most of our group has found this to be the best dose tho 3 of us have done 50mg snorted and while its VERY weird we all enjoyed it and plan to do again. <br /><br />Redosing with same dose is possible after trip has ended. Burns the same and lasts nearly as long (2.5hrs).
