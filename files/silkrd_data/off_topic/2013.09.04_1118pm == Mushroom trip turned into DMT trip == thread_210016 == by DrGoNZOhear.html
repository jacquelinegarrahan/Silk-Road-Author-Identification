				Just wanted to hear from some of the community on whether they have had a mushroom or other hallucinogen trip that ended up sending them into a similar world as when you blast off on some DMT?<br /><br />I ask simply because over the weekend a friend of mine and a few others all ate a 3.5 grams of some real strong mushrooms.&nbsp; While my trip was pretty intense it did not compare to my friend who said later, after he came out of his room 3 hours later, that he was in what we call lego land.&nbsp; Normally this &quot;lego land&quot; only could be reached by smoking some dmt which we did earlier in the day before ingesting the mushrooms but should not have affected the trip, at least i would think not.<br /><br />Hope to hear some similar stories or maybe even an explanation as to what happened. <br /><br />

				haha, i know exactly what you mean about the dmt &quot;lego land.&quot; i&#039;ve experienced that a few times! high dose mushroom trips can definitely be similar to dmt, probably because psilocin and dmt are so closely related.
