Within the same week of being on SR I made my first purchase, it all happened so fast lol. I was just like &quot;let me get on this fucking bandwagon before the po-po&#039;s fuck it up for me&quot; you know? Hahaha.<br />This experimental stage is nearly orgasmic for my bubba and I. We live in a place of make believe and make believe drugs, so SR is a pretty big deal for us. WE WANT TO EXPERIMENT LIKE SCIENTISTS, DAMN IT. It&#039;s also that feeling of knowing that you are probably the ultimate hookup for anything, even hookers, that is amazing&nbsp; ;D

Hash seems to be a good buy on SR, I&#039;d get in on it if I knew where to start. I want to buy more nose candy but damn is it expensive. I want to buy some really euphoric shit but I&#039;ve seen plenty of vendors fucking around with their yayo so I get a bit sketched. I&#039;ve been looking at the books for some time now, definitely gonna get a few of those. IRL shopping is a pain in the ass, I barely do it. Didn&#039;t walmart used to sell guns at least? Haha

				Unfortunately the said vendor has already told me, it&#039;s near impossible for him to respond to messages. He has had some shipping hiccups in the past, but still had good reviews. Should have just stuck to my usual vendor.

				I&#039;m sorry :(<br />I mean, usps does have it&#039;s hiccups as well (too fucking much if you ask me), just keep on keeping a lookout for your goodies. I hear that priority likes to take around 9 days every now and then.<br />Blargh, I&#039;m so sorry, if I could I would throw goodies your way through my screen :[<br /><br />
