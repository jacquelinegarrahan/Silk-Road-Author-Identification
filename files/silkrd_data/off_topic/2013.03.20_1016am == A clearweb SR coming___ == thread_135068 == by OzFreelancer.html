				Its just a sub-domain.&nbsp; Authorities will shut down the main domain based on routine W3C policies. <br />If its a hosting operation then they will shut down the sub site based on their own policies and such.<br /><br />What is preventing this site from being shut down with a simple letter to the registrar and domain host?&nbsp; I doubt they will defend their customer for a few bucks a month profit..&nbsp; .<br /><br />Of course, you could change the sub domain name every time it gets shut down. . and&nbsp; &nbsp;use a private DNS server and ask your &#039;users&#039; to use a proxy in their web browser to reach the &#039;secret domain name&#039; or whatever.&nbsp; . but it still tracable to the IP and provider.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You could theoretically buy internet in bulk (T1 lines and data Circuits) and register them to a fake name.&nbsp; Pay the bills on time and nobody will notice the fake name on the account.&nbsp; If it gets investigated or shut down, there will be nothing but a rack of gear there. . . . router, servers, UPS battery backup, and a switch. VPN router linked to a remote location and remote desktop/shell.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)&nbsp; &nbsp;if you get found. .&nbsp; Then, startup again someplace else with a new circuit order from Bell, Sprint or whoever.&nbsp; By purchasing a circuit, you can become your own provider of internet.&nbsp; Then you could say it was one of your web hosting customers who did it. . . and you can&#039;t locate them anymore. ..&nbsp; yadda yadda. .&nbsp; sooner or later they will catch on that you are the crook or that you keep selling services to crooks.&nbsp; It could work. .. .&nbsp; but your site will be down and up and down and up.<br /><br /><br />---&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think a private network would work better.&nbsp; <br />You would sell a monthly account to people to access the drug site.&nbsp; With their monthly fee, they get VPN network with anonymous connectivity and security, access to a tumbler for bitcoins and access to a small bitcoin exchange - so customers have everything they need all togther in one package.&nbsp; They would chose wether to use the site for illegal purposes or not and break the law. . otherwise, it would be legal to sell and use a private network.&nbsp; It just happens that the private network has this website on it that sells drugs and stuff. . .&nbsp; it would be private. <br /><br />Keeping the law out of the network would be as easy as verifying each account holder with a referral from another account that has been verified somehow.&nbsp; Maybe ask the new account registrations to accept a package in the mail, and then re-send it back to be verified. The package would contain something illegal to break the law.&nbsp; The cops wouldn&#039;t dare send drugs in the mail so they wouldnt complete the registration process and neither would anyone who is sketchy or worried about stuff or paranoid.&nbsp; Its not perfect but you should be able to spot the fink soon enough and boot them and also filter out any problem customers. . .&nbsp; dunno. . ...... <br />
