				So if you were to sub out the opium, do you get a little bit extra of any other product? Also instead of 2 25i perhaps you could offer a lower single dose of lsd instead(saw on your page you are getting liquid soon) just as an alternative. If you increased the party kit price by a little bit maybe you could also add .1g mdma. Just offering ideas on what I think would be cool in a party kit, by the way I think they look pretty good. Maybe you could offer different value party kits ($20, $50 etc) with different drugs/ more quantity of what you do offer. My small opinion, hope it helps.

				the opium hash mix sounds like fun.... i always wanted to try that. <br /><br />putting acid in the mix instead of nbome is a good idea. more people would buy it that way. liquid on sugar cube. or maybe some 2c-b instead? <br />yeah 2c-b and hash-opium! sounds like a good mix!<br /><br />How are you planning to deliver the hug?&nbsp; :D

				All right, so I&#039;m going to agree with TB... can&#039;t have a weekend fun kit for two without a little MDMA!<br /><br />Here&#039;s my advice:<br /><br />1 100mg Viagra Pill<br />2 150mg MDMA Pill<br />1 Bottle of Lotion<br />2 100mg MDA Pill<br />1/4g Pot<br />2 1mg Xanax<br /><br />Instructions:<br /><br />1. Insert MDMA into partners mouth, provide a single 8oz glass of water, instruct partner to swallow. Have them repeat this step on you.<br />2. Find something to do together for the next 40 minutes. Two episodes of the Simpsons or Family Guy without commercials should do the trick.<br />3. After 40 minutes have passed remove all clothing if you managed to keep it on for this long. <br />4. Apply lotion liberally.<br />5. Insert Viagra into male partners mouth.<br />6. Tell him it will kick in faster if he performs fellatio on you until he is ready to engage in sex.<br />7. Once sex is complete, look at each other and silently agree that you are now ready to get higher.<br />8. Insert MDA into partners mouth, provide a single 8oz glass of water, instruct partner to swallow. Have them repeat this step on you. <br />9. After about 5 minutes, realize that you were still actually pretty high off the first dose of MDMA. <br />10. Laugh about how silly it is that you are about to get much much higher.<br />11. Find the bottle of lotion again and repeat steps 4, 6 and 7 until you become distracted by the fact that the world now seems to be wiggling.<br />12. Enjoy watching the world while professing your undying love and eternal connectedness to the person you are sharing this experience with.<br />13. Now, with both of you extremely high, start making all sorts of promises about marriage, tattoos, having kids together, the sky is the limit.<br />14. As you start to come down and appreciate the fact that some of the things you talked about in step 13 would in fact be best to never mention again, insert marijuana into a pipe and smoke until your memory gets a little foggy.<br />15. If still conscience and no longer really high, take the Xanax and go ahead and wrap your arms around your new fiance whose name you will be getting tattooed onto your chest right after she quits taking the pill so you two can start a wonderful family together.<br /><br />&nbsp;That&#039;s how I do it anyway....

If you do end up getting some MDMA in there though I love 2CB as the come down, it really makes for a smoother landing. If you grab some of that alprazolam powder off the road you could cap 2mg Xanax pills for pennies. I hardly ever sleep well after a roll, although I&#039;ve never tried the opium / pot come down combo so that might be worth looking into as well if that works for others. <br /><br />Love the idea though! If you get some traction and people order a few you could have different combos. Include a meth kit with a little play whip, MDMA one comes with cherry chapstick, LSD could drawing pad and pen... heck you could even have a discount solo kit that includes half the drugs and a dirty magazine :-&gt;

				shall we say a few opium hash blend combos in addition to the bayer listings thst are now up sexilicious TB? <br />maby just put a listing of 5 up at introductory price to see if they sell? its very hard to make as our premium hash has a ver different temperature at which it softens as compared to the opium however I will give it a go tonight.<br />ACE
