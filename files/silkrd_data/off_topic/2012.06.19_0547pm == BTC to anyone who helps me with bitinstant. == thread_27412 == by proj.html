				I&#039;m having trouble understanding how bitinstant works. I&#039;m not really good with computers, about all I know how to do is use tor and sr, that&#039;s it.<br />If someone can tell me in detail step by step how to receive coins from bitinstant into my wallet I will give them a bitcoin or two.<br /><br />What I&#039;m having trouble with is after I select cash deposit to major bank branch what do I choose next?<br />It says &quot;Destination account&quot; and when I hover over the ? it says enter &quot;Your username or account id&quot;&nbsp; wth they talking about?<br /><br />etc. etc., so if you feel like helping me out and I actually understand what you&#039;re telling me to do I will give you 5-10 bucks in btc.<br /><br />Just for clarity I&#039;m wanting to make a cash deposit at a major bank branch.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Proj

				Are you trying to receive them via email? If so, use your email address. Do that and you should get a pay slip to download (they&#039;ll also email it to you), print it out and take it to Chase or Bank of America (I think) and pay it. You&#039;ll get an email from bitinstant and coinapult with your bitcoins :D

				First, figure out the total cost of what your purchasing from SR because you&#039;re going to want to deposit $15+ extra, depending on the cost of what your buying, to pay for the fees involved.<br /><br />Go to bitinstant and do the cash deposit to email (coinapult) using a yourname@tormail.org email account you set up and enter the amount you want to deposit.<br /><br />On the next screen you&#039;ll have a buy link or trustcash link, depending on how you&#039;re viewing the site, and this will take you to where you search for a bank to make the payment at. After you confirm this, you&#039;ll get the printout with their account number and name (TrustCash, Inc.). <br /><br />You can print this out and take it to the bank teller with exact change, tell them you want to deposit that amount into that account and either they&#039;ll fill out the transaction or they&#039;ll be lazy and make you do it.<br /><br />Then you&#039;ll get an email to yourname@tormail.org with a link asking where to send your coins. You&#039;ll want to first deposit your coins to a wallet or 2, like http://blockchain.info/ , which after you setup your account on there and use one of your addresses it will take a few hours before the transaction is confirmed.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve moved it to a wallet or 2, you can safely deposit it to your SR account, which the address is on your account page when you log into SR.

I have not used the cash deposit to btc address option yet, they must have just added that recently. I would imagine with that option then yes the destination account would be whatever wallet your wanting to send it to.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to look the cash to btc address option the next time I go deposit to see if there are less fees for sending it straight to the first wallet and not tying it to an email at all, interesting option but I&#039;ll let some others use it before I dive in.

				Ok, I got it all figured out. Ended up having to call customer service because no bank locations showing up. Turns out chase is the only bank in my area they accept and they&#039;re offline for a few days.<br /><br />Thanks meister you got me that far the least I can do is stay true to my word and send you a couple coins when they get chase bank back online. PM me your sr username and I&#039;ll send it over when this all works out.
