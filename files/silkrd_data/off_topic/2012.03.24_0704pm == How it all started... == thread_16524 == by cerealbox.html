				So what led you degenerates down the dangerous and illegal path of recreational drug use?<br /><br />For me, it was when I found out that people who used drugs weren&#039;t bad people, all homeless, criminal, violent, high-school drop-outs and I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I loved pot so much, thinking it&#039;d just make me feel kind of happy and hungry, that I wanted to learn everything I could about drugs and try as many as I could. Nowadays, I&#039;ll my experimentation to a minimal, but drugs sure are a great filler for when you&#039;re not getting laid.

				When I was young I was against drugs completely. Started drinking later in high school and continued doing that for a couple of years. My first drug other than alcohol was mushrooms that my roommate brought for me to try out. After hesitating I tried them and loved them. After that I&#039;ve been VERY interested in how substances change our consciousness. It&#039;s been a journey ever since.&nbsp;

				For me alcohol was the &quot;Einstiegsdroge&quot; (drug of introduction) as we say in German, which I started to drink regularly in large amounts while at college. Later, while drunk I met a guy in a bar who took meth and smoked some together with him, which I would have never done without the disinhibition caused by alcohol. Since then I have also tried various other stimulants, which I have mostly liked. But without alcohol I would never be posting on this website or buying stuff from here.<br /><br />And yes, I am full time employed, a doctor no less, married, also have drunk some beer and smoked some meth purchased from here right now ;-). Luckily my wife is away and I have holidays.

				Golly gee whillikers.<br /><br />I feel a little strange saying LSD was my [flickering flames] gateway drug. Really. First ever. Transformative? Yes.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t a) drink alcohol to the point of intoxication, b) smoke marijuana, c) opt-in to anything beyond to spinning to the point of dizziness<br />before that.<br />Never did smoke, for some long convoluted reasons. So cigs didn&#039;t lead me to the Road To A Young Person&#039;s Ruin. Nor did weed. Nor did the hooch. Nor did... anything else, despite a lot of 1-2x tries.<br />Discussed this with my supervisor-at-the-time once. She could not stop snickering and seemed to think it explained a lot.<br /><br />Love Einstiegsdroge as a word, thank you for that one!<br /><br />--f.<br /><br />

				My dad smoked pot in front of me from a young age, I referred to it as his special smoke and saw nothing wrong with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was pretty traumatized around age 11 when we had the school indoctrination re drugs and I realized his special smoke could land him in jail... Dad was fairly successful in life by most standards and I couldn&#039;t see what was wrong about what he did.&nbsp; <br /><br />A couple of years later the massive lie campaign building up to the Iraq war destroyed what little faith I had in authority and a couple of years later when I was fifteen and I met some one who actually smoked pot (sheltered upbringing/private schools) well why not try this stuff and find out what it does.. I liked weed but I think the discovery of Camden when mushrooms and plenty of other things were available really pushed me towards being the &quot;druggie&quot; that I got labelled in my last years of compulsory re-education.&nbsp; Great times they were.

				I was not very cool in high school I guess, I mean I had a couple of friends but girls never seemed interested. So, I tried getting drunk one night and sort of hated it and didn&#039;t think it was as awesome as everyone else did. I drank around other people and would usually stop before I got drunk (still do). I was super against all illegal drugs but one day decided why not try smoking weed just so I can say I did it once. At this point I knew SO many people that tried, it seemed harmless. Well I really liked it and convinced myself that I wouldn&#039;t do it often and still believed drugs should be illegal. I didn&#039;t really start smoking like I do now until I came to college. <br /><br />What REALLY did it for me was when I was in my English class and my teacher gave us some paper to read about MDMA use. It wasn&#039;t really a biased paper because it talked about one kid whose life got ruined on it but most of the people in the story tried it and still lead fine lives. I knew so little about mdma and at this point thought that one time use could kill you. This story was an eye opener and really got me thinking about illegal drugs that were considered hard. Well about two years later (junior in college) I finally found a way to get molly and tried it. From then on I never trusted a single word I had ever been told about drugs and decided that every drug was fair game until I did enough research on the internet to prove to myself it wasn&#039;t worth trying. I&#039;ve tried alot of drugs since then but still won&#039;t touch EVERY drug. <br /><br />Overall I&#039;m really happy that my mind has been opened, before this I never really completely thought for myself and just trusted whatever&nbsp; the general opinion of anything seemed to be.

				I was adamantly against drugs in my early teens. Most of that was the fact I couldn&#039;t stand losing any sense of control, and I knew drugs often do just that. I have no idea what changed, but I drank my first bit of alcohol on St. Patrick&#039;s Day when I was 19. A few months later I smoked weed, and at that point I knew one of my goals would be to sample as many substances as I could (within reason- won&#039;t be touching Krokodil any time soon). I moved to shrooms, ecstasy, coke, percocets, heroin, and now that I&#039;ve discovered SR I&#039;ve tried several RC&#039;s and meth. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to give the wrong impression, though. It&#039;s purely coincidental that I tried harder and harder substances as time went on- I met my sources in that order. My life is more or less the same as when I first drank my first sip of alcohol, though with spare cash I opt to try new drugs than buy video games.

				When I was very young my parents got divorced. I wasn’t affected by this because I was so young and didn’t really know what was going on. I had my first cigarette when I was nine when a classmate offered one to me – I thought this was cool at the time.<br />When I was 12 my mother died and moved provinces to live with my father who was already re-married. He caught me smoking within the first week I was staying with him, confiscated my cigarettes and forced me to quit.<br /><br />I started smoking again two years later when my eldest brother (3 weeks before his 18th birthday) died in a drunk and driving car accident. I have yet to stop from then.<br /><br />Shortly after my brother died I met some people who got me involved in drinking and smoking heavily. With these guys I had my first hit of weed but I’m not too sure if I felt any effects or not because I was quite drunk as well. During this time I had only experienced weed once or twice and never really thought much of it.<br /><br />A couple years later my other brother (17 at the time) who was heavily into weed asked me if I wanted to smoke a joint with him, very curious, I said yes because this would be the first real experience of weed on its own not compromised by any other substances. This weed was quite good, or due to my low tolerance for the plant – either way it not me the fuck out! I couldn’t see what was on the TV and felt like I was falling when I lay down. Finally after falling for an eternity I fell asleep and woke up with the most incredible hunger, and so, I demolished a loaf of dry bread because I was too lazy to make anything else as the effects were wearing off. After this encounter I did not touch weed for some time.<br /><br />I moved to a new country with my father and step-mother when I was 16. I went to boarding school because the only schools that were nearby were shit and my parents wanted me to do the Cambridge syllabus which none of the other schools offered. At boarding school I continued to smoke and got caught a few times but always managed to mangle my way out of getting beaten six with the cane (corporal punishment). I met some new friends here who once again got me back into drinking and smoking heavily. Then one very blurred night after far too many Absinth shots I had my second real encounter with weed through a home-made “bucket bong” or “gravity bong”. This weed also sent me spinning and I don’t remember the rest of the night – apparently quite epic though!<br />Then about a year later I went back to my home country to visit my mates and my best friend had some Durban Poison which, to date, has been the most insane high I have ever gotten from weed. I literally couldn’t walk after this stuff! This was the real deal! Or laced with some hectic shit! But still amazing!<br />About 6 months later my new found best friend from boarding school introduced me to some good shit. I don’t know what it was, probably jut but still gives a bit of an effect which was good. I got offered to move into a mess with another two guys who, believe it or not, were both very much so into weed and partying. This offer came at just the right time and I snapped at the chance to be FREE for the first time!<br /><br />I spent 6 months with these buggers consuming abnormal amounts of weed and alcohol. In about the third month my cousin, who happened to be a full-blown drug addict, offered me and my mate some crystallized Ketamine which he called “Angel Dust” – I now know that it is not Angel Dust but I believed it was at the time. It gave me quite a rush on top of the weed that we had already consumed and kept me buzzing out of my mind for about half an hour. It was a very nice feeling but I swore to only try each drug once and still to date I have not touched any more of it.<br /><br />I moved back home and continued to quench my ever-growing thirst for getting stoned. My girlfriend moved in with my parents and I and we would smoke weed together pretty much every night. My girlfriend and I both decided that we wanted to try Ecstasy “just once” and we eventually came across some one night out and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />We took the pills (yellow capsules) at about 11PM and proceeded to the next night club. At around 12.30 we were feeling no effects and were very pissed off that this wasn’t working! I called the drug dealer and told him that I wanted a refund because this was some bullshit! He told me to meet him at his usual spot. We went there and he opened one of the capsules and poured a bit into my hand and told me to put it on my tongue – it was a fucking horrible taste, very bitter and had a slight burn to it that lasted for about 15 minutes. Still unsatisfied, my girlfriend and I went to my mate’s house where we were to be spending the night just her and I. His house was about 20 Kilometers from where we were and by the time I got to his front gate my eyes were wobbling every 10 to 15 seconds. I knew that I didn’t feel the same but I was convinced that this was only the effects from the little but of powder I had put on my tongue because my girlfriend was still feeling fine. We drove into the yard and everything looked so beautiful and colorful.<br /><br />We went into the house and I had a look at my eyes in the mirror and my pupils were pretty much taking up my entire eye – no color was visible! We sat on the sofa for about 10 minutes when my girlfriend started feeling a few effects, by this time I was coming up quite fast and it felt nothing short of amazing!<br />My girlfriend and I sat on the same sofa for about 5 hours just talking to each other and expressing how much we love each other. Stupidly we had done this on a night when I had work the next day. After the feeling had fully worn off it was already about 6AM and I had work at 8! Long story short – I was 3 and half hours late for work!<br /><br />Since then I crave E quite often! I am not addicted to the chemicals found in weed or in E, I’m just addicted to the feeling that I get but I am certainly not dependent on any of the drugs I choose to do.<br /><br />Most people who do drugs are normal people. You see people every day and you may not even know that they do drugs. I now hold a very respectable position in my community and run my own business very successfully but I do enjoy the occasional “fucked-feeling”!<br /><br />And that&#039;s how it all started for me!

				Smoked Pot in highschool really hard for about 6 months, then gave it up.&nbsp; Stayed clean till about3 years ago.&nbsp; I married my wonderful wife close to 5 years ago.&nbsp; 10 months into marriage she was diagnosed with stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma.&nbsp; Life became and still is a living hell.&nbsp; I gained weight, developed chronic back pain.&nbsp; Doctors threw lortab at me whenever I wanted it.&nbsp; I got up to about 25 pills a day, a very expensive habit not to mention the aweful mood swings.<br /><br />When you have cancer, the cancer center doctors throw any drug you want at you.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking liquid morphine, liquid lortab, liquid dilaudid...Norco 10&#039;s, xanax, methadone, fentynal,... u name it, they prescribe it if you have cancer.<br /><br />So because of my addiction I started skimming meds from my wife&#039;s supply.&nbsp; <br /><br />So now my wife has a team of doctors at two different cancer centers.... they all act the same way, giving her large amount of EVERYTHING we ask for.<br /><br />My addiction to opiates became too much.&nbsp; I went to a doctor out of town and broke down and admitted my addiction.&nbsp; The doc prescribed me Suboxone.&nbsp; Let me tell you it&#039;s a fucking miracle.<br /><br />I went from 25+ pills a day to 2 suboxone a day.... absolutely no cravings or withdrawals.&nbsp; You take your last pills at night, go to bed.&nbsp; When you wake up, (has to be at least 4 hours later) pop a suboxone under your tongue..... instantly the withdrawals vanished.&nbsp; the suboxone basically clogs your opiate receptors... meaning you can down 10 pills on suboxone and not feel a thing.&nbsp; So now im down to one suboxone every day or two.&nbsp; Sometimes I forget.<br /><br />If anyone in here ever needs help getting off opiates, even if you just want to start over with a little more control, msg me.&nbsp; I wish I had enough money to buy this stuff and give it out for free.<br /><br />So, now I use only what i can control, some pot here or there, maybe a pill or two.<br /><br />Thats my story.&nbsp; Sorry for typing a long post.<br /><br />LP
