				I saw someone write that 25i helped him with his awkward social issues.<br /><br />For the past couple months I&#039;ve been trying to order at least a couple hits of lsd with some of the btc I buy, but man the market looks especially shitty this week. And I&#039;m gettin my coin tomorrow.<br /><br />The best looking offer I see is jeurgens, and I&#039;m not really comfortable with that for several reasons. So I&#039;m thinking I might skip the L this week :(<br /><br />But I do like to trip. I was thinking about picking up some 25I instead. I&#039;ve read awesome trip reports on erowid. What do you guys think should I go for the 25i or splurge on L that I can&#039;t really afford?

				I&#039;m very pro nbome, I&#039;ve had nothing but great experience on kwiktrips tabs and I will continue to use it as a substitute to LSD unless the price goes down considerably. For what it&#039;s worth, everyone says the best LSD vendor right now is 3jane.<br /><br />I was really excited to try nbome after reading on erowid as well but just like almost all erowid trip reports, I found most of them to be greatly over exaggerated. I&#039;ve seen some great visuals, all the colors washing out of the room and out the window is still a visual that rivals anything I&#039;ve seen on high doses of LSD. On LSD I get plenty of melting visuals, more than most I would say, and nbome is the same for me, lots of melting.<br /><br />This may sound strange but there is one desktop wallpaper I&#039;ve kept for a while and I always view it when tripping on anything to give myself a reference point. It has clouds over an ocean view and on shrooms the clouds move like you would expect clouds to do, on LSD it does the same except they sort of pulsate for me as well, it&#039;s always been this way on many trips. On nbome I was expecting the same but was surprised they didn&#039;t move at all, instead they sort of twirled into a spiral and just slowly kept spiraling in place. This has happened on 3 consecutive nbome trips.<br /><br />This weekend will be my first in a while without an evening with nbome, since I want to try out Limetless&#039;s moxy which I&#039;ve never tried before.
