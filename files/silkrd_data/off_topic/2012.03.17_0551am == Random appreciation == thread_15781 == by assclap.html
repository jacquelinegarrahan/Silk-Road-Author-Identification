				You guys that manage SR are revolutionary&#039;s. This goes for the admins and vendors. If this could be done on the normal web legally the US would save so much money and so many peoples lives wouldn&#039;t be ruined. Y&#039;all are great. Thanks for everything.&nbsp; :) ;D

				Completely agree. Its nice to be able to buy a product and know its not cut to shit by other drugs. Makes my high so much more anticipatable (if that&#039;s a word). I appreciate this site tremendously.

				For those that use SR to buy drugs, the biggest thing, to my mind, is that you do not have to contact the street element. This alone is worth it. You don&#039;t have to go through the bullshit of dealing with people that, let&#039;s be honest, you probably would never even talk to much less be cordial with in your everyday life. <br /><br />Now, of course, there are good dealers that are good people, but, in my case, getting something like weed requires contact with unsavory elements that I would rather not be dealing with, and I&#039;m sure this is the case with many people here. <br /><br />You take the street out of the equation and are able to enjoy your product without the ugly feeling.
