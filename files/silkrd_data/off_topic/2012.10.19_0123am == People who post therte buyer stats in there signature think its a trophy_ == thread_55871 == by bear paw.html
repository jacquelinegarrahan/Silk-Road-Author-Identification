				hey NEWBIE<br /><br />anyways the reason I post my stats is because I am a vendor &amp; I want my buyers to be assured I am a legit Buyer &amp; Seller and it shows that I am a little more involved with the community &amp; SR Pages.I don&#039;t ever want a BUYER to feel that I am not forth coming about myself I feel doing this helps with my sales and the privledge with some buyers that I don&#039;t have TO FE when they see my Buyer stats

And quiescence is a form of humility.<br /><br />Therefore, if a great kingdom humbles itself before a small kingdom, it shall make that small kingdom its prize. And if a small kingdom humbles itself before a great kingdom, it shall win<br /><br />p. 35<br /><br />over that great kingdom. Thus the one humbles itself in order to attain, the other attains because it is humble. If the great kingdom has no further desire than to bring men together and to nourish them, the small kingdom will have no further desire than to enter the service of the other. But in order that both may have their desire, the great one must learn humility.<br /><br />The reason why rivers and seas are able to be lords over a hundred mountain streams, is that they know how to keep below them. That is why they are able to reign over all the mountain streams.<br /><br />Therefore the Sage, wishing to be above the people, must by his words put himself below them; wishing to be before the people, he must put himself behind them. In this way, though he has his place above them, the people do not feel his weight; though he has his place before them, they do not feel it as an injury. Therefore all mankind delight to exalt him, and weary of him not.<br /><br />The Sage expects no recognition for what he does; he achieves merit but does not take it to himself; he does not wish to display his worth.<br /><br />I have three precious things, which I hold fast and prize. The first is gentleness; the second is frugality; the third is humility, which keeps me from putting myself before others. Be gentle, and you can be bold; be frugal, and you can be liberal; avoid putting yourself before others, and you can become a leader among men.<br /><br />But in the present day men cast off gentleness, and are all for being bold; they spurn frugality,<br /><br />p. 36<br /><br />and retain only extravagance; they discard humility, and aim only at being first. Therefore they shall surely perish.<br /><br />Gentleness brings victory to him who attacks, and safety to him who defends. Those whom Heaven would save, it fences round with gentleness.<br /><br />The best soldiers are not warlike; the best fighters do not lose their temper. The greatest conquerors are those who overcome their enemies without strife. The greatest directors of men are those who yield place to others. This is called the Virtue of not striving, the capacity for directing mankind; this is being the compeer of Heaven. It was the highest goal of the ancients.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just saying, you have the best posts on this entire forums, I read what you said in the anxiety thread also. WHY DOES THIS MAN HAVE NEGATIVE KARMA. One day, I&#039;ll get 100 posts and you&#039;ll be the first one I +1

				I wonder if there is a security risk to posting buyer stats here.&nbsp; I would not do it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want anybody, even sellers, to be able to correlate my forum identity with my SR identity.
