				2001: A Space Odyssey for an epic experience, and Enter the Void for an out-of-body experience.<br /><br />If were expanding from &quot;shrooms&quot; to &quot;psychedelics&quot;, then for LSD or NBOMe, I&#039;d recommend &quot;Fight Club&quot; if youve been looking to reevaluateu your life, and &quot;Rubber&quot; if you want to see just how useful psychedelics can be for gaining an increased understanding of whatever.

Lol<br /><br />I usually prefer not to watch movies/ tv while shroomin&#039; in lieu of either being out in nature or Terence McKenna style in total silent darkness. But a few I have enjoyed while tripping were Donnie Darko, Caddyshack (the gopher had me laughing til I was crying as did Bill fucking Murray), Farce of the Penguins and Into the Wild.

				beethoven or pixar/disney movies are great if you want to keep the vibe light. there&#039;s an insane pink elephant bit in dumbo where they&#039;re all dancing across the screen and when i watched it again sober it was completely different to how i saw it. some good shrooms 8)

				thanks for the recommendations, I have heard &#039;enter the void&#039; is good, but is that more intense? Hadn&#039;t even thought about Pixar movies and other animated, good call there.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen 2001 in forever... isn&#039;t that kind of slow?

				I really don&#039;t think you need any movies when you are on a high dose mushroom trip, ditto LSD or DMT, man. The movies would pale in significance compared with what&#039;s already going on in your head!

				movie whilst tripping is almost ritual for me. i&#039;ve watched alice in wonderland more times than i can count. you can easily zone out and drift into your own thing if the trip takes you away but being prepared with a few movies and some sweet playlists just makes sense. you could watch a random trippy tv show like community or ideal..

				umm I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t mean to be a buzzkill or anything but why do you wanna watch movies while tripping? You should go outside and enjoy the day or if it&#039;s at night go out and enjoy the night.&nbsp; I never really got anywhere with tripping and watching movies. Try listening to music and smoking and bullshit. I don&#039;t know just trying my 2 cents.

				I highly recommend Primer. Extremely well made sci-fi, with a very realistic feel.. Saw it while coming down from a 5g shroom trip and it fit prefectly with the psychedelic mind, even if it wasn&#039;t very visually stimulating. My intellect was intensely stimulated :)

				The Community paintball episodes were winners.&nbsp; Tried watching some Avatar but it couldn&#039;t keep our interest.&nbsp; Watched some Hobbit later on, but it was too much for me as I went through some weird moments...<br /><br />We actually didn&#039;t end up watching any one thing for long, too distracted with laughing about little things!<br /><br />Really glad I didn&#039;t watch Enter the Void.&nbsp; I decided to check that out the next day... it was way too &quot;out there&quot; and dark for my taste.<br /><br />Thanks for the recommendations everyone!<br /><br />

				I know this isn&#039;t a recommendation and probably sure this movie has already been named anyways but thought I&#039;d add this story since we&#039;re on the topic. One time I ate around 1.6 grams of some shrooms and watched Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and didn&#039;t realize until about an hour into the movie that I had the playback speed on 1.0x and was trying to figure out for the longest why the voices sounded so funny and chipmunk like, I just thought I was tripping lol. I don&#039;t know it was pretty funny to me.

				When I recommended Bambi, I had only seen clips of it during the tail-end of an acid trip, and I assumed it would be perfect for tripping, because it is one of the most artistically beautiful films ever made.<br /><br />Yesterday I watched the whole film during the height of an acid trip, and I never cried so hard in my life !<br /><br />And I started crying even before Bambi&#039;s mother was shot dead. The whole movie, from the opening scenes, is imbued with a sense of melancholy that is subtle when you&#039;re watching it sober, but is really brought to the surface when you&#039;re tripping. Even the &#039;cute&#039; scenes seemed very sad to me.<br /><br />Although it mad me sad (to the point of almost having a bad trip), it was the most beautiful film I&#039;ve ever seen. No other film can beat this in visual beauty, as far as I&#039;m concerned. Especially when you&#039;re tripping. Modern special effects seem cheap compared to the beautiful artwork of early Disney films.....<br /><br />I still recommend Bambi, but be prepared to cry a lot.

It was the single most rewarding movie experience in my life. I cried 300 000 times and had to take numerous breaks to catch my breath and smile for just a little while. It is beautiful and very subtly told. An example is the scene when the older brother maybe 1-3 years old is about to throw a toy at his baby brother because he wants attention and his mother stops him and it hurt so bad just watching him consider doing it. So very human. <br /><br />It was an exhausting and cleansing experience.

				i watched enter the void tonight vaguely while i was smoking. I enjoyed it and am going to watch it tomorrow more intently (high) and examine it&#039;s psychadelic merits. i like to have 1 - 2 movies around while i am tripping in case I want to watch something.

				i watched fantasia tripping and got so bored i had to turn it off after about 10 mins. just reading through again for inspiration for an outdoor acid trip.. i&#039;ve not seen cloudy with a chance of meatballs but i got it on a flash drive swap and the name and plot desc just sounds like something you should consume with drugs. anyone else seen this movie while tripping or under the influence of anything?? they need an extra feature on imdb like people who enjoyed this high as fuck on ..&nbsp; shrooms, weed, acid, mxe etc

				Byork&#039;s music videos are great to watch on mushrooms, esp. the full-length compilations she&#039;s got. Probably there are some torrents out there for it, otherwise you could cue up a bunch from youtube.
