				Hey friends, <br /><br />thought it would be interested to gauge what other people think on the size of SR, everyone seems to agree that growth is bad but also good, mostly bad! <br /><br />I was thinking the other day that myself alone I have like 7-8 accounts that ive made on the forums, let alone SR main <br /><br />so even if every member here has one other account that would half the actual number of people who regularly use SR, <br /><br />I thought tony76 would also be a good judge since he has a good number of drugs in a number of catagories and hes got about 1000 fans, <br /><br />so my guess is that the real number of how many members we have is actually quite small <br /><br />thoughts?

				I think a lot of people have probably came on, maybe got one thing and though waiting a nervewracking week wasn&#039;t for them.<br />I personally love but the 2 people I&#039;ve showed this site to ordered one thing and said &quot;No...&quot;<br />Anyway probably like 8-10K considering that.

				The number of members here is incredibly small considering what is being offered. <br />I wonder is it because no one knows about it or that it is too hard for most people to figgure out how to partispate?
