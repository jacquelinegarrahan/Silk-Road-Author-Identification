				I know this is a long shot since this is my very first post and I have no idea how guarded a secret this is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using an e-cigarette/personal vape and successfully quit smoking 3 years ago because of it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent those 3 years searching for a successful recipe for a THC e-cig tincture to no avail.&nbsp; Upon entering SR for the first time just a week ago I saw that these tinctures were being sold in plenty of shops.&nbsp; They seem like a great bargain too for the price, but I&#039;d rather learn to fish for myself as the saying goes.&nbsp; Would any of you wonderful people be willing to share your recipe?

				Of course!&nbsp; This is the best example I could find: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/15216&nbsp; In that listing, it&#039;s already loaded into a cartridge.&nbsp; It would be a mixture safe to use in an e-cigarette so presumably glycerin or propylene glycol based.

				I&#039;m a proud supporter of the Fuck Combustion campaign.&nbsp; Not only have I found great e-cigarettes that hit harder than a Marlboro Red, but I&#039;ve recently bought an Extreme-Q for my herbal vaporizing. ;)&nbsp; It&#039;s not very portable, but the efficiency and potency of the hits just can&#039;t be beat.&nbsp; The lack of portability though is where the e-cig tincture comes in handy.&nbsp; I would imagine it&#039;s also extremely stealthy since you can hold in vapor until it disappears completely and puts out hardly any odor.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t call myself a vaporizing guru, but you can definitely send any questions you have my way and I&#039;d be more than happy to try to answer them.

				I understand it was an important part of my switch too.&nbsp; Well there are a few factors that contribute to the hit you&#039;re going to get.&nbsp; One is the voltage/temperature your e-cigarette is running at either 3.7 volts with one battery or 6v with two, the 6v hits like a freight train in comparison, but I still prefer a 3.7 for battery life and size of the unit.&nbsp; The second is the atomizer you choose...the 510 atomizer is known as the hardest hitting and it&#039;s the one I&#039;ve used since I started religiously, it&#039;s a beast and they&#039;re durable too.&nbsp; The third factor is the nicotine strength you choose when you buy your juice.&nbsp; They compare 8mg to an ultra light, 18 mg to a light and 24mg(which is what I use) to a full flavor cigarette.<br /><br />As far as suggesting a specific model to you, I just need to know how much you&#039;d like to spend.&nbsp; A quality e-cigarette will last you for years and fulfill every need, but they can be a little pricey at up to 100 dollars.&nbsp; A cheaper model will work just fine, but it&#039;s more disposable, and they&#039;ll run you about 35 dollars.&nbsp; The best part of buying a hand-crafted e-cigarette is that all of the parts are mechanical and easily cleaned so you only ever need to replace the rechargeable batteries and the atomizers occasionally.

				http://www.thevaporpro.com/throat-hit-plus.html<br /><br />add that to any e-cig cartridge and you&#039;ll have your throat hurting in no time.
