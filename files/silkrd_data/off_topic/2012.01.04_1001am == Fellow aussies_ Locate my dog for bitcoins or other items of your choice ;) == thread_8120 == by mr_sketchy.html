				Hi All<br /><br /><br />I have a microchip number for my old dog, that I would like tracked/located.<br /><br />I gave up my dog, due to my poor health, work and other circumstances beyond my control.<br /><br />Its a decision I greatly regret. I would like to track the location of the dog, so that I can see if the new owner, by the appearance of a co-incidental &quot;running into&quot;, would be willing to sell the dog back to me.<br /><br />Please dont think that I would in any way use the given information to steal the dog or anything like that. I would never do that to anyone.<br /><br />I guess in order for you to be able to access this information, you would probably need to know/be/have access to: a vet nurse, vet, vet clinic admin, animal shelter admin, Central Animal Records database, council officer or the such.<br /><br />Im not sure what kind of fee you would like for such a service, but Im sure we can work something out. Bitcoins are my preferred payment methods, though Im open to other forms of payment.<br /><br />Contact me either by reply post or a private message and we can take it from there.<br /><br />Cheers

				Understand you want your old dog back, but if he is in a happy home and being loved, why not adopt another dog from a shelter?<br /><br />There are SOOO many pups sitting on death row who just need a chance. Plus, it will be a&nbsp; shit ton cheaper to adopt than haggling with some guy who&#039;s grown attached to your dog.<br /><br />Just my .02<br /><br />ps get a pit bull. they&#039;re definitely lovers, not fighters.

				Yeah you could make a real differance adopting from the pound. My dog is a pound pup and she&#039;s the most intelligent, loving and loyal non-human creature I&#039;ve ever known.
