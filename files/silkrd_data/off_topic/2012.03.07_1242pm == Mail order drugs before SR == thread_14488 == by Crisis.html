				Does anyone have experience with having drugs shipped to them through the mail before joining SR? I&#039;ve always been curious how prevalent this was.

				yes, that&nbsp; was the only way i could receive drug due to my remote area, sometime it never came through but i think that was because of dodgy seller.<br />i have had no troubles with SR, 110%<br />i highly recommend using the mail than carrying it as-well<br />Wacko

				Yes, this stuff has been going on well before SR or bitcoins.&nbsp; When I started getting into internet mail orders the only thing you could do was western union or cash, then we had money packs, and now we have digital currency.&nbsp; <br /><br />It has been prevalent for a long time.&nbsp; The SR is actually harder to get to than most of the forums were 10 years ago.&nbsp; There were some forums where you had to have a lot of rep to get access to the markets on the forums, but there was even more forums where anyone could use the vendors.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t have to download TOR and worry about buying bitcoins, you could just join a forum and buy whatever you want with a quick trip to WU.

				Mail order drugs has been going on since the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; My dad used to tell me stories about how his friend in Texas used to mail him Aucopolco (sp?) Gold way back then.&nbsp; SR has just made it to where you don&#039;t have to have a friend to do it for you, it allows you to make those connections here at a much higher level.

				It was very prevalent, probably more so than it is now even. I remember hearing some statistic on how a majority of weed, rolls, and other psychedelics would come in through the mail from Canada. Still probably true today. It wasn&#039;t easy to find the hookup back then though, you had to be persistent or know people. It was also far less secure than SR. I remember just using hushmail with no encryption when placing orders. I ordered weed twice from GDS services, and twice I got some pretty flame buds, still remember the strains too. Black Ice, Headband Kush, and some random purps. They were definitely being watched though, and I would hesitate of ordering outside of the SR system again if given the chance.

				Dr Green always treated me right with his t-shirts way back<br />I also received free edibles from Dr Green for reviews on his forums<br />I heard he had scammed people in the past plus his personality<br />was a bit problematic when trying to purchase his products but<br />once he knew you everything was great<br /><br />Jays joints a blast from the past<br /><br />I sold a considerable amount of roxi 30s on certain forums yrs back<br /><br />

				I&#039;d like to know more about mail-order sites in general. Before Bitcoins and encryption sounds daring. Are there sites that have been in business for years? Decades? What are other current sites, restricted or not? I figure if I want to a do a lot of business, it would be best to have multiple sources, non? I have a friend that uses an invite-only site, but he&#039;s very protective of this kind of information (obviously). I&#039;ve been hearing about the Deep Web for years, but site names seem to come rarely and for good reason.
