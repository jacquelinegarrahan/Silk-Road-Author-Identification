				So, I just received a letter in the mail that was shipped from South Africa and it has a substance inside of it.<br /><br />The substance is in a baggie that is double vacume sealed.<br /><br />It is a tan looking powder.&nbsp; Does not look or smell like MDMA,, I think it might be a research chemical of some sort.<br /><br /><br />So.... I have not ordered anything from south africa lately, nor do i order such small amounts.&nbsp; it looks like .5- 1g.<br /><br />Who sent this to me and what is this substance!!!!<br /><br />no fucking way I am going to try it out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will not shulgin this one up

				Wise choice man - test that shit - and also do a melting point test on it - when doing so - see if it produces a distinctive smell and&nbsp; post descriptions .<br /><br />Weird shit man .

				Test it or toss it (though surely curiosity will win out).<br /><br />There was a thread a little while ago about somebody getting an unexpected freebie and getting &quot;in trouble&quot; as a result - theories of a kid buyer, parents catching him, etc, all speculation - but also all a derail from a real issue which is that you need to know when this shit is on the way. Some of us have practices tailored to receiving special packages. You can&#039;t just mail this shit around like candy. <br /><br />Update with results, please!

				Damn this doesn&#039;t sound good. mainly because somebody somewhere has your address and is either sending you a sample to try and get you hooked so you keep buying from them, I read a quite freaky story about it once on the forums, Guy was sending out H samples and demanding people try them or something, I know it sounds dumb but i cant remember the full story, anyone else remember this?<br /><br />But hang on , it could be more elaborate and somebody was testing your address, not sure what for but it&#039;s always possible. I would either try it, Sell it or just toss it mate. <br />Wonder who decided to send free drugs out anyway, doesn&#039;t seem normal either way,.

				The &#039;main issue&#039; I see here is that a vendor HASN&#039;T DESTROYED ADDRESSES AFTER SHIPPING!!!&nbsp; This is a BIG NO NO!<br />&quot;There was a thread a little while ago about somebody getting an unexpected freebie and getting &quot;in trouble&quot; as a result &quot;<br /><br />YEP! :o<br /><br />Like that dumb kid in oz who got busted and had ALL SORTS OF PERSONAL INFO on his CUSTOMERS when LE busted him!&nbsp; They got his iphone computer/s and shit loads of incriminating shit ...
