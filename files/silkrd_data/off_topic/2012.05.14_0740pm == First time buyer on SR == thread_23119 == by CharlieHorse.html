				I&#039;m new to SR and want to make a purchase of about a gram of coke. <br /><br />1. Are the prices always so high? <br /><br />2. Will I have to FE because I&#039;m a newbie? <br /><br />3. Who can I trust? <br /><br />Any feedback would be most welcome. I totally support you guys and want to get more involved but don&#039;t want to get scammed or have a negative experience. I read the Complete Guide and most of the relevant posts but need some further clarification.

				1. Coke prices on SR are always high and quality varies greatly.&nbsp; Can&#039;t really vouch for anyone since it&#039;s not my DOC really<br /><br />2. Most likely<br /><br />3. No one<br /><br />EDIT: I just looked it up and coke around my area is $120 a gram and that&#039;s pretty much what it&#039;s going for on SR, so I guess coke is just a really fucking expensive drug, lol.<br /><br />Another piece of advice would be to start small, as small as possible is best.&nbsp; People are more likely to stay in escrow with new people and small amounts.

				I believe coke prices are high on SR is because for the most part (not always) higher quality then street stuff.<br /><br />Not all vendors ask for FE if you are uncomfortable with FEing then find a different vendor.<br /><br />Hang around the forums for awhile get to know people and whats going on and you will be fine :)

				I know this is a pretty noobish question, but what does it mean to finalize early? I&#039;m looking to make my first purchase and I want to know as much as possible before I dive in.

				If you are a new buyer with less the a certain number of transactions or have a high refund rate the vendor will ask you to finalize early (FE) which means finalize the transaction before you get the goods or even before they will ship the goods.<br /><br />Look around, you may find a vendor that will allow you to keep your order open until it arrives, but I wouldn&#039;t hold out too much hope if you are truly a new buyer.

				For product quality and vendor reliability, check out the stickied Cocaine Vendors Review thread in the Rumor Mill section. That is where all of the cokeheads hang out. It&#039;s a massive thread, so start with the last page and work your way back from there.<br /><br />To avoid having to FE, you may want to buy from a new vendor. That way you&#039;re using each other to build a reputation.
