				I see LOTS of this when watching any drug-related documentaries or videos recently. I assume these are LEO, or maybe just idiots. Anyone familiar with this phenomenon?<br /><br />I&#039;m considering attempting to fuck with them just to waste their time, kinda like the 419 scammer revenge stuff.

				I saw this at a few comments on NeuroSoup&#039;s videos. She even made a video about it saying that she believes it&#039;s ether a honeypot or some really stupid people.<br /><br />This is exactly my opinion. :D
