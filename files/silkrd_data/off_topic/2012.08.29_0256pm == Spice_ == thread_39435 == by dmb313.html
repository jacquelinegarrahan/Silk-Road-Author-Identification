				Ok ok wait.<br /><br />Spice is now illegal. What is the point of it then? Why not just smoke weed, it&#039;s better for you than spice and the only reason that I know of that people even tried spice was because it was &#039;legal&#039; to buy. It was already way overpriced here, so I don&#039;t see the point :-\.

				well, even though it is illegal, people that have regular urine test and don&#039;t like going to jail every week for some THc, so it only makes sense to smoke spice still, seeing as i like <br />my freedom more. if i didnt have constant drug testing of course i&#039;de be smoking some sourD right now lol<br />---<br />it goe&#039;s for ten a gram here all day, if not more. <br />damn, the shit&#039;s now the price of decent chrons lol<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Lol it was about $25 a gram here if I remember. It was pretty scarce as most people just smoked weed instead. And I see your point with drug tests, honestly I&#039;d rather just buy detox drinks and work out a bit to pass rather then switch over to spice, hated the high :-\. I love my weed :).

				From what I am told there are even corner stores over here that are making their own &quot;spice&quot; $20g<br /><br />The foil pouch stuff that is still siting under counters at head shops or what ever. Those are normally 3g packages - some sell as high as $60 for 3g.<br /><br />Use to anyway, I dont know if anyone actually wants that stuff anymore.<br />

				damnnn $25 a G, that&#039;s so ridiculous, i did smoke while on supervison for awhile, used a whizzinator i made at home lol<br />but it&#039;s just a felony to get caught using that,&nbsp; and i&#039;d just be all kinds of fucked, not worth the risk anymore. <br />damn, i havent heard of any stores in my area that are amking their own spice, i think almost all the stores that sold it have quit because of heavy fines and felony warnings from LEA, <br />alot of people in my area still want it because of our local cops love getting the entire town on probation at once pretty much.

				Well, that was one reason I never bothered smoking it lol. Weed is SO much cheaper here. They have drinks and pills at GMC (if you&#039;re in the USA) that work wonders with a little working out, never failed a test yet :).

				So does anyone have any interest in &quot;spice&quot; here on the road? <br /><br />I have a buddy that (I think) still has some from a business that he was involved in.<br /><br />Last time I talked to him....he had the stuff sitting around because they can&#039;t sell it anymore.<br /><br />I could probably get some and vend it here on SR.<br /><br />There is someone that has spice for sale, but you need to buy like 100 packets, and the other guy sells his own &quot;homemade&quot;<br /><br /><br />I do not know anything about the stuff, so if anyone is interested in details you need to let me know. <br /><br />I DO know what the primary cannabinoid in these are. So if that would help, hit me up.<br />
