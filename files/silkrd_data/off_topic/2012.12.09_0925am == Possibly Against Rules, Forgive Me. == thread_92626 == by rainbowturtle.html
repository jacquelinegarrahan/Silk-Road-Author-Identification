				I&#039;m not selling this, I just want information about it. I&#039;m not looking to fuck the working man so please refrain from hating, discussion and arguments are encouraged after answers.<br /><br />So there is a site called WHMX Counterfeits, they have 20usd bills for sale for a good price. <br /><br />there is however 2 sites and I want to know which is the legit one<br /><br />http://whmxwxv6lc22itzl.onion.to/index.html<br />OR<br />http://whmxwxvfa2dves5k.onion/index.html<br /><br />So according to the hidden wiki, they have the second link as the url but if you go into the hidden wikis marketplace reviews there is this statement.<br />&quot;The real WHMX is WHMX20@tormail.org and http://whmxwxv6lc22itzl.onion NOT: http://whmxwxvfa2dves5k.onion&quot;<br /><br />I think it would be good to contact the hidden wiki mods and let them know the first link they have is wrong and is directing people to the fake one.. How would someone do this?<br /><br /><br />Ok so about the bills,&nbsp; can you share your experience?<br /><br />If you know someone who has had success post here or pm and privnote me.<br /><br />What was/what do you think the quality is like?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think discussion about this topic is prohibited&nbsp; because there are many topics about it in the forum that suggest it is only the sale that is. My apologies if I&#039;m wrong.

				I don&#039;t have any advice to give really, but how much do these bills cost? If you don&#039;t mind my asking, what would you hypothetically do with these bills?

				Read this thread<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91834.msg646385#msg646385<br />You should probably wait for ballzinator&#039;s feedback

				Yup, whmx20@tormail.org is the original one. Still not sure if it&#039;s legit though. One person claims that WHMX scammed them.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85136<br /><br />So the question is: Is Acrimonious legit? When I buy from WHMX, I will insist on using the escrow service on HackBB because that&#039;s definitely legit. Will update in the thread that acider posted.

				I&#039;ll be looking into this. If they can use a better shipping method to avoid detection I would be willing to work with them.<br />Does anyone know what country they are based in? <br />I thought they were based in France, am I wrong?&nbsp; Can&#039;t I just get them reshipped if customs was really the issue?<br /><br />
