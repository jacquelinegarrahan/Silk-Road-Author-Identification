				Hi all I&#039;m here just to say that buyers should have a round table on vendors too cos I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some real childish vendors who will deal with a buyer F, the buyer then go back to the vendors round table and spread lies about you to stop other vendors dealing with you this is why I think a buyers round table or section should be born so that we as buyers can explain fully on every transaction that went wrong so that some childish lying vendors don&#039;t stand a chance to go back and lie what do you lot think why should the vendors have a so called round table section where we the buyers can&#039;t see or read what&#039;s being said it&#039;s not fair so I think one should be born asap for buyers too which in turn gives the vendor a chance to respond so EVERYONE can read it ok let me know what you think people cheers, phoboss.

				Please learn to write in sentences. <br /><br />You have a place to discuss vendors already, it&#039;s call the rumour mill.

				Hes right though! <br />not really sure what your asking, you want a section where we can talk about vendors. we do its called the round table like reich said.<br />or do you mean similar to vendors round table in that you want a section in which&nbsp; the vendors cannot access,&nbsp; and only buyers can talk about vendors without them seeing?<br />If this is what your asking I dont think it could be implemented because there would be no way to keep vendors out. they would just create a diff account in the forum other then there vendor name.<br /><br />plus i dont see the point to it. I see what your saying but we have that!
