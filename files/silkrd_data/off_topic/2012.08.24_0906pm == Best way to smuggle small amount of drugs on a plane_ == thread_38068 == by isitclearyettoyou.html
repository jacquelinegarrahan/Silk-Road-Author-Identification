				Hi,<br /><br />I want to travel state to state within the U.S. with an eight ball of cocaine. Given the body scanners and pat downs I&#039;m thinking up my ass is probably the best way to get through security. I&#039;m really worried about doing this safely though. Anybody have any suggestions? Are there products out there meant for body cavity smuggling?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />isitclearyettoyou<br />

				&quot;Best way to smuggle small amount of drugs on a plane?&quot;<br />Snakes. Coz err&#039;body knows you don&#039;t fuck with no motherfuckin&#039; snakes on no motherfuckin&#039; plane.<br /><br />In answer to your question though, the safest method (unless you can get hooked up locally from a trusted source) would be to mail it there - is this a possibility? You really don&#039;t want to be caught smuggling drugs over State lines, because you&#039;ll be open to charges of trafficking rather than simple possession - a charge which carries harsher sentences, and is viewed more seriously by those disgusting creatures we call &#039;judges&#039;.

				I approve of every message in this thread.<br /><br />And since the OP is probably reporter/LE: you should just eat...all of the drugs you wish to smuggle. Don&#039;t worry about protection.<br /><br />&nbsp;Carry the other drugs you do not eat in a carry on.<br /><br />Win.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Take a train. bus or mail it if at all possible...<br /><br />I got a gm of hydro from Toronto to the NE USA taped to the bottom of my foot.<br /><br /><br /><br />That was pre- Sept 11th though.

				Look into getting a body pocket if you want to do this regularly. It&#039;s a simple operation.

				So I&#039;m law enforcement or a reporter and I should get fisted as hard and as deep as possible. Good thing we all use this anonymous forum so we can get straight answers...

				I&#039;ve done it a handful of times. Very small amounts though. Like a few meth shards, x pills, etc. I&#039;ve never kept them on my body though. Once I went through a scanner and they detected a gum wrapper in my pocket. Scared the shit out of me.<br /><br />I bought a bottle of tylenol, and removed the padding on the inside of the lid, put my shit in there, then re-sealed it. Done deal.
