				Bitinstant was the only way I could get bitcoins and it seems that they are becoming increasingly pathetic. I will likely hang out on the forums and shit but SR is pretty much over for me until I find a BTC service like bitinstant used to be.

				I feel you bro! I have been struggling these past few weeks to find a suitable seller in my location to no avail.<br />I am still searching.<br />One method you may want to try is buying them via SR. There are a few sellers who seem legit, just search &#039;Bitcoins&#039;.<br /><br />Stick around the forums even if the marketplace isnt for you right now!

				The best site to get bitcoins is localbitcoins.com you can buy them pretty much every way possible.&nbsp; cash deposit at a bank, western union, vanilla reload card, online bank transfer, dwolla, okpay.&nbsp; They are soo reliable and they are my go to site for coins. I hope you get back into SR.
