				I have gotten into it with dopes and knaves on my local streets many a time. I am almost famous here for it. I have also hassled gangbangers and Latinos in their cars with loud subwoofers, done citizen&#039;s arrest on one, and chased one through the park when he came in a restaurant and threatened me at a table. I could tell you more. I am fearless. Comes with chastity, something older peoples used to know. Chastity also made my voice deeper and my beard coarser. Save the male essence; you become more male. Wankers and sex addicts didn&#039;t win WWII, and don&#039;t win any war.<br /><br />Just yesterday I was in an open conflict with a local leather-clad, Harley riding biker. He started his friggin noisy Harley and revved it just as I was walking by. He was also right next to some people sitting at an outdoor table, and and I try to do my part to protect the quality of life in the public realm, especially pedestrian areas, in my town. He was also parked illegally. I have confronted these morons many times. I ostentatiously plugged one ear using just my middle finger (a favorite gesture I make to bikers), my head turned slightly toward him to get his attention. When I got to him I called &quot;F----g Moron!&quot; right at him over his egregious and unnecessary noise. (Excuse me, but I was pissed.) This was as I was walking and about to turn into my favorite coffee shop. I heard him turn off the Harley then he walks in and up to me where I was standing in line. He demanded &quot;What did you say?&quot; or something. I said &quot;You hurt my ears,&quot; and &quot;You have no right to hurt anybody&#039;s ears. This is the public realm,&quot; etc. He got really abusive and foul mouthed, making a big scene with me, slapping his leather chest like an Italian (as in, &quot;c&#039;mon, hit me.&quot;) He was all decked out in black leather, boots, and is palsy with many of the people in the shop who think he&#039;s cool. He was extremely agitated and saying very hostile things, and the manager started to yell at the two of us. He wanted me to go outside. I just called him a moron again and explained that he had no right to damage the public realm or to hurt my or anybody&#039;s ears. The owner of the shop kept yelling &quot;take it outside guys&quot; and he turned and left. Turned out he was a Hollywood stunt man, has been in some big movies (&quot;Kill Bill,&quot; and others), and thinks he&#039;s a big deal. (One line I&#039;m considering for him next is &quot;Can&#039;t you afford a muffler for that piece of junk?&quot;)<br /><br />This was yesterday morning at around 11 a.m.

				street fights/road rage are pointless. Get charged , possible injury or for what? To prove yourself to someone you won&#039;t ever see again? Bottleing some one from behind with a big bottle of wine when the victim is totally not watching is much more manlier , make sure you run off to to really prove you are the true alpha male.
