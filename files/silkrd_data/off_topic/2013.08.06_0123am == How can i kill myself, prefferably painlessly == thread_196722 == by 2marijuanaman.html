				You could invest that into LSD and DMT. Then consume the LSD. If you still have these thoughts, try the DMT. I&#039;m simply passing on information I hear works. &quot;To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.&quot; I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s &quot;selfish&quot; and all that but I do believe it&#039;s often a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve thought about this a lot but please don&#039;t go through with it

				whats the reason your going to kill yourself? You should talk it out with people first before acting on it. As a SR community member I would like to say on behalf of all of us you should talk it out with us and see if we can help you. Ultimately it is your decision though so after a through discussion i will link you to a product that will quickly and painlessly kill you.

				OP.&nbsp; This is really really horrible advice I&#039;m going to give you, but, you should shoot some Heroin. It&#039;s better than sex. <br /><br />And if you&#039;re really serious about having tried all of those psychedelics and none of them changed your mind, perhaps you could be a candidate for Ibogaine.&nbsp; As that would definitely change your mind. <br /><br />Otherwise, if you do both of these things, and still want to die... just do more heroin. :D Or more Ibogaine O_O.

				Not to be irreverant, which is to say; I&#039;m being a complete asshole, but don&#039;t call me on it. If your going to go out, go out fucking spectacularly! Rent a fast car ( fucking jack up that credit card brah ), get some high tensile fishing line, tie said fishing line tightly around each major joints anchoring each line to something solid at around the same length ( keeping the the one around your neck the shortest ), do this at the top of a parking structure or similar drivable high point, and floor it like you stole it! If all goes to plan should be fairly painless and quick.&nbsp; The fishing line should cut through quite easily. And has the add benefit of being quite the baller suicide.

				I hear H is the shit but there are some seriously hardcore addicts out there. What quality of life is using money intended for necessities for heroin? I&#039;m not saying OP will immediately become an addict of this extent but this is a human being&#039;s life here. I personally vote for trying something else before the heroin route.

This is just as well otherwise the human race would probably have died out a long time time ago. However even if sex is not possible, presuming your genitals are producing gametes then you can still have children.<br /><br />Human sex isn&#039;t just a physical interaction; much of it takes place in the mind, and is to do with communication with your partner(s). The anticipation is sometimes the most exciting part of it. Presuming there are parts of your body which respond to touch, then there are plenty of sex workers who would be pleased to entertain you.<br /><br />It&#039;s worth remembering that Hans Christian Anderson, Isaac Newton, Ludwig Von Beeethoven, Nikolai Tesla and many others whose names are honoured for their contributions to our culture are thought to have lived their lives without having any sexual relationships.<br /><br />Summarising, the thought of never having sex might be depressing, but I don&#039;t think it need be a reason for committing suicide.

				Right on, take a close look at it and work it out first, it&#039;s a permanent choice once you take your own life, and if there is an afterlife you have no guarantee it is better than where you are right now.<br /><br />No one should ever use the following information; I&#039;m just presenting some info I found when researching it years back. Simple asphyxiants from what I understand are pretty painless ways to go. Basically they displace all the oxygen and you essentially black out. Normally it would be done using a face mask such as a hospital oxygen mask. Then that gets hooked up to a cylinder of some gas, can be just about anything except oxygen, like welding gases (nitrogen, argon, etc) have no odor. Basically with that flowing through the mask it gets strapped over the nose and mouth. Within a couple breaths you pass out. The mask straps make sure the mask stays in place so that even if the body tries to breathe it just gets more gas without oxygen. Stuff like nitrous oxide etc can also work as long as they don&#039;t have more than a few percent oxygen in them. Even a propane cylinder would probably work but it is going to stink. Or natural gas, but the added mercaptans will make it stinky. Even a very small cylinder is enough. A CO2 paintball tank would probably work also.

				Dont think $100 will cut it bro, maybe chill save some more money, and if you still feel this way you&#039;ll have more money therefore more options.&nbsp; Who knows, you might even change your mind in this time and by a new playstation instead.&nbsp; But I&#039;d be making sure I did it properly if I had no other options which means, wait some, save some money and see how you feel.

				friend do not do it!!!! just realize the damage on your brain that has the Television/ media done. You cant seriously believe that sex is the number 1 MUST rule in life. go fucking masturbate for fucks sake.<br />If you are from the guys that used to make fun of disabled people, and now you are one of them, and cant stand your self, please be my guest and die.<br />like all said, everyone has his ups and downs in life. you propably are too young to think with your own mind, see with your own eyes etc... <br />Being yourself is the coolest thing you can do in life... but you have to find him first, not to mimic a fucking character, or ending being a combination of characters.<br />Please, let time pass. <br /><br />In anycase, go see a fucking doctor or something.<br />Oh, and have you tried salvia?? i really had a &quot;near-death experience&quot; and i never did salvia again, i got my lesson and was simple as that: You can be whatever you want in this life. You just need to take a decision.<br />So if you think that you would be more useful for yourself (u know, fuck the society), you could try find something that feels your empty time, and your spirit.<br /><br />I think you should really start playing an instrument like guitar or sth. If the society will make you kill yourself, why dont you make the society kills itself instead?

Don&#039;t let the demons in your mind win, because maybe it doesn&#039;t seem so but THERE is a light at the end of the tunnel and I&#039;m not talking about the one you may or may not go down when you die. You need to clear your mind and really meditate about what life is all about, because it&#039;s not about others perception of your and it sure as hell isn&#039;t about money. Some of the happiest people I&#039;ve even known in my life are broke as hell and come home smelling like shit everyday.<br /><br />It&#039;s apparent that you are very young, if you haven&#039;t even experienced college yet, you have so much life to live and dont&#039; even know what you are missing. I know the old arguement about who you will let down sucks and really doesn&#039;t mean shit when you are that low, and again like so many others, I&#039;ve been there bro. But my life is better now that I could have ever imagined, great family, great job, more things to live for than I could have imagined and when I was your age I woudl told someone your a fucking liar if they told me I would have what I do now.<br /><br />Not to mention just look at this forum. There are people here with such big hearts that just knowing you are fellow human wanting to end his life calls for them to reach out to you. And just think, if these strangers who don&#039;t even know you care, how much do the people who really know you care?<br /><br />Bottom line is you need to clear you mind, get off whatever drugs you are on for now, and if you still really feel that way, get some help, even just a suicide line. Sometimes all we really need in this world is to know that someone cares, and believe me, those folks running those lines aren&#039;t there for money, they are there because they care and you will feel better.<br /><br />And don&#039;t discount your life situation for love. I&#039;m not the best looking fella IMO and scored a HOT ass women who was the biggest slut I ever knew and generally made my life hell. Kicked her ass to the curb and found me a thick one and she&#039;s straight out of heaven as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />She ain&#039;t exactly pretty<br />Ain&#039;t exactly small<br />Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six<br />You could say she&#039;s got it all!<br /><br />Keep hope alive!

I know I&#039;m a random from the internet but take my advice and read that book that comes with the cyanide.

				Your getting some good/bad and otherwise advice here which is to be expected.&nbsp; I cant tell you how much most of the forum members want to be able to get a message through to you and in our own way we are all trying.&nbsp; We really are.&nbsp; But a title like this thread has will also attract non constructive advice (I have been guilty of this in the past).&nbsp; <br />Some of the posts in this thread use humor or similar experiences but everyone really does give a shit in their own way.&nbsp; I might be wrong&nbsp; but It feels as if guys like Pillfire, cheeto and jethro are speaking your language and have all had a very genuine concern for your welfare, perhaps read over their posts again if you are still reading this thread.<br />.<br />There&#039;s one chance bro, no rehearsals or practice rounds, just one chance to make the most of what you have and do your best to live a full and happy life.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how hard it is for you and to be honest your story has caused me to shed a tear.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I would be the only one either.&nbsp; I&#039;d say I&#039;d be 20 years older but it seems like yesterday and I still remember.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have an easy time as a young man either but there&#039;s enough good examples of that here without me needing to add mine.&nbsp; &nbsp; But mate I remember the feelings and it&#039;s real and I&#039;m certainly not saying what your feeling is not.&nbsp; But I can also promise you that a lot of the things contributing to your feelings right now become so much less important as you get older. To the point where the focus of your life completely shifts from what is now to a totally different area which is difficult to explain,&nbsp; I know many a parent or mentor for young people have tried.&nbsp; The good news is this all starts for you now, your stage in life will be fast moving, people around you will grow up and so will you. <br />.<br />You are the answer your looking for and you are here right now and I reckon for a pretty good reason.&nbsp; I hate religion, and I don&#039;t believe in god but I have a very strong belief in a universal energy we all share.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to find it or wait for it mate, its already inside you and I think your about to find out how this life you&#039;ve been given is pretty cool and how strong you are as a man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t disappear on us will you? drop a post and say gday &lt; although we might only use this in Australia.&nbsp; Just say whatever it is you say in your country, that&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; &nbsp; I feel like I should finish with a song but it&#039;s hard in an post.. ok just a few lines.... <br />.<br />You only get just one time around<br />You only get one shot at this<br />One chance to find out the one thing that you don&#039;t wanna miss<br />One day when it&#039;s all said and done<br />I hope you see that it was enough<br />This one ride, one try, one life to love<br />-33miles-

				1. A large dose of dilaudid or morphine substantial enough to cause severe respiratory depression (Uncut Heroin works too)<br />2. large dose of benzos (Valium or Phenobarb)<br />3. Carbon Monoxide poisoning, you just kinda drift off to sleep. (run the car in the garage.)<br /><br />DON&#039;T<br />1. Hang yourself<br />2. Shoot yourself in the temple or anywhere else that might leave the brainstem intact and you a retarded vegetable.<br />3. Use aspirin or tylenol. It&#039;s a long painful death over months after killing off your liver<br />4. Cut yourself<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying to hurt yourself. But if you do it and no one can stop you then do it right. My best suggestion is that you ask for help. I understand your predicament and I often wonder what I would do if dealt those cards. I&#039;d probably lock myself in the garage with a running car and a full tank of gas or the benzos. CO poisoning is pretty much irreversible unless the paramedics find you quick. Benzos and opiates can be reversed with enough Narcan or Romazicon. If I had access to Propofol I might try that. A big enough dose will kill you peacefully. Just remember your family will be destroyed over it and feel guilty. Don&#039;t do that to them.

I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of peeps on here that have considered or even tried to kill themselves. There are shitty situations and a lot of people seek out drugs to try and make their situation less shitty. I only know a bit of your story (what you&#039;ve said) and sure it&#039;s tough but what relief will come from death? We don&#039;t know. It&#039;s possible to get a bit of a better life while alive though: maybe travel -- even if you got to catch rides across the country -- and leave everything you can behind. Some things you can&#039;t escape but then you can try to find people: there&#039;s websites to find people to talk to and meet up with who share thoughts/beliefs/hobbies like yours. <br /><br />If nothing ever works suicide can always be a solution you put back on the table but there are so many other things that you can try before then and once you try suicide you can&#039;t put anything else back on the table to try. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I always tell myself anyways.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish
