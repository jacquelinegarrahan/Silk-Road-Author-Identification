				seriously though, anyone got any advice?<br /><br />there&#039;s gotta be people here who have had luck at pain management clinics or just regular physicians getting opiates<br /><br />this is an interesting and useful thing to discuss

				not personal experience advice no. i&#039;d suggest finding your local junkies and asking if they know of any unethical doctors or pharmacists. otherwise there&#039;s always armed robbery. a guy from a relatively famous band did that once when he was on tour and couldn&#039;t get his DOC. can&#039;t remember which band. metal. blah. he got caught immediately.

				pain clinics test you for other chems and to assure you are taking your prescribed meds as directed. They will also call you and give you so many hours to show up for a pill count. First time everything isn&#039;t perfect they will cut you off in a second.They will take the pills right out of your hand and toss you out of the office and no other doctor will touch you.
