				Alright guys, here&#039;s what I have to report. I spoke with Scout and I&#039;m told I cannot publically post the address.<br /><br />JPinkman, the guy who was unfortunately scammed by Coachella420 gave me the address. The address he gave me correlates with the same known geographical location that he mentions in some of his other clearnet website accounts, leading me to believe that its not a burnable drop-point. Using multiple sources I can almost say for certain the address I have is very closely related to Coachella420 if not his actual home (apartment) address. Also, when critically analyzing Coachella&#039;s alt accounts and reading his posts during his rise and downfall, it is evident that he is not up to speed with the latest security practices and most likely did not have the means or motivation to ever secure multiple drop points. In less words, Coachella420 is sloppy. <br /><br />Personally, I feel as if he should have to pay for his crimes. It angers me so many people have been scammed by him and have no recourse. To those people who have been personally scammed by him, I will share the details I have of him via PM and you can choose to take whatever action you feel is justified. The one thing I ask is that the information is NOT shared publically as I have been asked very nicely to not do that. <br /><br />Coachella, alternatively, I offer you another plan. If you get in contact with me with some plan to right the wrongs you&#039;ve recently done, I won&#039;t release anything. Your move.<br />

Your move.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is skirting very, very dangerous territory.<br /><br />One cannot say with full certainty that the address in question does indeed belong to coachella420, even though the information put forth here would seem to make that the case. However - and keep in mind I&#039;m not one to wax lyrical about moral values - it is completely immoral to release such information to anybody unless you are personally 100% sure that said information is 100% accurate. If the information is in any way incorrect then an innocent person will be facing the wrath of a large number of people, some of whom I&#039;m sure would do very harmful things to the person that they think is coachella420. If it is him, excellent - a scammer will get his comeuppance. If it is not, then an innocent person will be deeply affected by this.<br /><br />I have always stood up for anyone falsely accused of anything here, ensuring a level of fairness until the facts of a situation can be ascertained; those facts were established by coachella420&#039;s own admission of guilt. However, as a member of this community (whether outcast or not), he is entitled - though certainly undeserving -&nbsp; to the same anonymity as the rest of us. If we destroy one person&#039;s anonymity, how can we claim to be entitled to anonymity ourselves?<br /><br />A society is defined by its moral code; up to this point we have always ensured that anonymity holds the highest standing in our underground society, regardless of the actions of any member. If we do not take the necessary steps to safeguard that anonymity then other members always take up the slack, ensuring that anonymity remains intact for all. That anonymity is a PILLAR of this community, and whilst I would applaud any actions taken to resolve the situation whereby coachella420 effectively scammed those that put their trust in him, we simply cannot put an innocent in harm&#039;s way which goes against EVERYTHING that we, as a community, stand for. Doing so would make us no different from the government thugs that arrest and interrogate on limited evidence in order to secure an admission of guilt, or see &quot;justice&quot; done.<br /><br />I urge all of you considering releasing information and/or planning on acting on said information to seriously consider the possible consequences of those actions if an innocent person is mistakenly caught up in this.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I think this thread is going in a bad direction.&nbsp; You are free to message coachella420 to see if there&#039;s anything he will do for you, but do not post anyone&#039;s private information here.&nbsp; It&#039;s best to see if you can work something out with the vendor, rather than resort to threatening them.
