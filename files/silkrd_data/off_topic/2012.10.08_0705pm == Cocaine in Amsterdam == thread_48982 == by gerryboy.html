				Just order some from a holland based vendor and have it sent to your hotel like a normal business letter they will save it for you. Better than buying speed and paracetamol off the street!

				nah i defo won&#039;t be buying it from the street over there. <br /><br />i had thought about the hotel idea. do you think i would need to get in touch with the hotel first and asked if i would be able to have a letter sent there or just have it sent under the name the rooms booked to. I would feel a tad guilty though, it&#039;s fine if i want to risk having drugs sent to myself but to someones business address... not entirely sure how that sits on my moral compass! saying that though i would like some good c for this trip.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it mate you&#039;re in Amsterdam you&#039;re going to walk out of your hotel and be confronted by 17 year old hookers in windows, sex shops, gay bars, coffee shops and hallucinogenic smart shops, a cheeky gram in the mail won&#039;t make much difference!

				Easy! Taxi Drivers!<br /><br />Purchased both pills and coke (good shit too) of cabbies out there. Just get in a car with a youngish driver, dont act like a prick and ask if he he knows anyone. Last 2 times the blokes had gear on them already! Piss easy!<br /><br />Just dont buy fuck all off the street.
