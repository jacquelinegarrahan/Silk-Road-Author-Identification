				Because you had such a hard time finding the forum, I guess you missed the search bar in the top right corner..<br />It&#039;ll answer most of your questions.

				Welcome IB.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty new as well. Not so sure about procuring bitcoin in Paris as I have only done so in the US. As far as using a credit card or hackers &#039;cracking&#039; it. Transferring Euros to bitcoin is as legitimate as transferring Euros to any other currency. As long as you trust the site or company you are using to do the transaction, I&#039;d guess you are fine. <br /><br />Good luck and warm regards,<br />T4B

This is because bitcoins are non-refundable. For this reason, none of the exchanges accept credit/debit cards as forms of payment.<br /><br />There are a number of ways to use a credit card to purchase things such as Second Life Linden Dollars etc. but I have never done that, so I can&#039;t offer any more information on it. You can buy various ways via bitcoin-otc.com (SEPA transfer, Western Union, Moneybookers etc.) - below is a list of sellers currently trading BTC for EUR: (it&#039;s a clearnet link)<br />http://bitcoin-otc.com/vieworderbook.php?sortby=id&amp;sortorder=ASC&amp;type=SELL&amp;nick=&amp;thing=BTC&amp;otherthing=EUR&amp;eitherthing=&amp;notes=<br />I can recommend &#039;sturles&#039;, &#039;yossarian&#039; and &#039;Mqrius&#039;. You can see their ratings by clicking on their usernames.<br /><br />You can also buy Bitcoins via Western Union from canadianbitcoins.com, or via cash in the mail from a well respected Bitcoin exchanger right here on the forums, vlad1m1r - his SR listing is here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/57b32a1924<br />You can read more about his service here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22148.0<br /><br />If you need any more help feel free to contact me by PM.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Kind regard,<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Totally unrelated, but - gratz m8, i suppose.<br />CC - to BitCoins, there you are safe. Lots of exchange places for CC-&gt;BC.<br />Use BitFog for additional anonymity, but its tad paranoid, especially if you aren&#039;t vendor.
