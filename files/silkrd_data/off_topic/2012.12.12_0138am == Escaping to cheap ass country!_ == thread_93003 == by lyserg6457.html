				Hi everyone! I want to escape to sunny place for 1-3 years or maybe forever, where everything is cheap, get a easy job and grow some cannabis to make my living. Not much just enought to pay half the bills selling to tourists.<br />I was thinking of Thailand, specifically Chiang Mai where its possible spending to the equivalent of 10$ a day to eat local food. Studio apartments going down to 60$ a month.<br />Problem is foreigners may not work in Thailand without a work permit and visa, which need to be attained prior to arrival.<br />I can get a 90 day entry permit but if I overstay my visa or entry permit, I&#039;ll face a 500 Baht fine for every day Im over the limit and must pay it before Im allowed to leave the country. The Business visa is&nbsp; $50 and allows me to be in Thailand for 1 year. But I have to cross the border every 90 days, problem is I have no business to do in Thailand, nor do I think I got enought money to travel for ever 90 days stay.<br />Also considered an illegal immigrant and could be arrested and thrown in jail if, for some reason, you&#039;re caught in the country with an expired visa or entry permit.<br />Will it be possible to rent a apartment anonymously or with fake id/passport, no questions asked and live there for few years?<br />Is paying some restaurant there to sign papers verifying that Im working as a bartender possible excuse for me staying there?<br />Got any other country I should consider or maybe other suggestions to my blemish plan, hehe?

				Man, this just seems like a terrible idea to me. You plan on breaking two laws (growing weed, overstaying your visa) in a third world country notorious for its harsh drug offenses. If you get caught, expect to get rinsed for every penny you&#039;re worth, or much worse, get thrown into a Thai prison. <br /><br />Have you actually spent time in a third world country before? It&#039;s fun for a while, but for most people, the poverty, police corruption, and clash of cultures gets to be too much to handle. Almost every idealistic foreigner I&#039;ve met with similar goals to yours ends up leaving long before their intended departure date. After all, there&#039;s a reason everything&#039;s so cheap in those places- the quality of life there is usually terrible...<br /><br />If you decide to actually go through with this, you should at the very least spend a few weeks before you decide to make it your home.

				Thailand is probably one of the stupidest places in the world you could live if you plan on making your living selling weed. Their laws are far harsher than even America&#039;s draconian laws. It&#039;s not unheard of for them to execute weed sellers/growers/traffickers. Why not just move to Washington or Colorado if you live in the U.S.? You can grow your own &quot;personal stash&quot; and then just sell it on SR for a profit.

				Find a place and develop a reputation for being helpful, and volunteer to teach English to the natives. You can then likely live off your weed wages, and sent exotic drugs back to your homeland. Then you can settle down and marry one of those Thai lady-boys and have a nice studio apartment and take cheap valium and smoke opium all day and get handjobs from a man-boy. <br /><br />Sounds like a great plan.

				I want to walk on the edge and its a risk I&#039;m fully aware of.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really looking for a paradise, I&#039;m looking for experience as living in third world country and poverty and corruptness is only a part of that. Merge amongst the local people.<br />Lived my whole life with all kinds of benefits, now I want to experience the opposite. :)<br /><br />Massive amount or hard drugs trafficking in Thailand is punishable by death.

				Mate I think Thailand&#039;s a lovely place with lovely people lovely food lovely pussy or the other if your into that and you could quite easily live there and do what you said but please do remember it is third world so here&#039;s a few things that could go wrong whilst living there ok,&nbsp; arrested beatenup robbed kidnapped imprisoned or even killed and guess what no one would know so even though the temptations great and it looks fantastic and comfortable don&#039;t ever forget in these places you go alone and could very easily die alone if I was you I&#039;d stick to where you are and do what you want there with the freedom breeze behind you cheers

				I came across this very useful article yesterday on how to live abroad on a budget: <br /><br />http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-travel-full-time-for-17000-a-year-or-less<br /><br />It contains lots of links on volunteering, getting fed and housed for free. But, most incredibly, it made me discover the possibility of house-sitting, where your job is basically just guarding a luxury house while the owners are not there.&nbsp; 8)

				One member of the ILF was particularly struck by the use of the label &quot;third world&quot; in this thread.&nbsp; It would seem that if at one time that label were useful, it now no longer is ... at least for the US of A, whose infrastructure is rotting and who actually has a place, a rather large region of the country in fact, called the &quot;Rust Belt,&quot; which was not named ironically.&nbsp; There are cities in the US with downtowns full of shiny glass skyscrapers, where money gets made.&nbsp; Surrounding --and insulating, and employed in protecting-- those giant sparkling penises in the air are miles and miles of slums.&nbsp; We don&#039;t call them &quot;slums,&quot; but that doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t!&nbsp; <br /><br />When I was in American grade school and first heard the definition of &quot;first&quot; and &quot;third&quot; world countries, I distinctly remember these specific characteristics:&nbsp; a) a few insanely wealthy people, defended by lots of guards who are poor, b) poverty poverty poverty, c) bad roads/bridges/sewer systems, and, oh yeah, d) not enough people living in cities, (because the bias for the West is always pro-city, anti-rural).&nbsp; I think we&#039;ve got it right here, kids!&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not a Let&#039;s-Hate-on-America post:&nbsp; it&#039;s more of a gentle reminder that the world is not so black (ahem, yellow) and white.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Here´s a good story.. <br /><br />Much like you, I thought fuck this shit (weather wise and went searching for greener pastures. <br />In my list of possibilities was Asia, Africa, southern spain, greece and a few islands. <br /><br />It took me a year to consider my options, In the end I settled for southern Spain, That decision was made because of the following.:<br /><br />1. There are many &quot;off the grid&quot;· hippy communities living in the mountains there, its common knowledge that they all grow copious amounts of weed and opium lol, so if shit ever hits the fan, I buy a camper van, [edit]completely new life, off the grid within europe. <br /><br />2. I wanted to stay within the euro zone to manage my money easier. <br /><br />3. Everyone around here speaks English. albeit with a funny accent. <br /><br />4 Its an amazing place, mountains, hippies,&nbsp; sunshine, warm winter days...<br /><br />5 I dont live at any of the communities but I visit[edit]<br /><br />6. If you have a car you can go anywhere without checkpoints or customs! spain is the gateway to Europe.. well actually its france but they&#039;re both connected. this summer I will be buying a van and hitting all the festivals in eastern europe. <br /><br />7. LIVE FREEEEEEE<br /><br />

				Personally I wouldn&#039;t mind saving up a decent amount of money and take off for the Netherlands or something. One of those everyone rides bikes around cities with canals and drugs and women. But then I look at my budget and I&#039;m like, fuck, I&#039;m going to Nicaragua.&nbsp; :(

				Thanks for all the replies, I´ll take a month to sit down and think about how this can be done, why not get student visa and study the language and culture, 1-2 year right there. If not I could take a buss over to another country every 90 days...
