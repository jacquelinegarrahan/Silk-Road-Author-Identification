				I&#039;ve only tried crack on one previous occasion but am surprised to see that there are literally NO UK crack vendors at present, only one selling &#039;brack&#039; (smokeable benzocaine). I&#039;d always imagined there was quite a large crack market in UK, with a lot of heroin users smoking it, as well as H. Has it totally gone out of fashion in the UK, or is there just a lack of decent quality out there?&nbsp; :-\

It is *shockingly* moreish. Even years later I can occasionally reminisce that melted-plastic taste, and it creates a weird sort of craving/hunger. The times when I did it, I easily would have carried on and done things to get more. Serious &quot;drug seeking behaviour&quot; occurs with that stuff.<br /><br />So, like crystal meth, it&#039;s not popular in the UK, and for the above reasons I am pleased about that.

				Crack is incredibly easy to make. Perhaps dealers in the UK think that everyone knows how to make it.<br /><br />From Clearnet:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />There are two ways to make &quot;Crack&quot;; one is the &quot;baking soda&quot; method (which is, by far, the most common), and the other is the &quot;freebase&quot; method, which is best for optimal potency.<br /><br />-------- Baking Soda Method-------<br /><br />MATERIALS:<br />1.) Lighter<br />2.) Glass Beaker<br />3.) Distilled Water<br />4.) Baking Soda<br />5.) Rubbing Alcohol<br /><br /><br />PREPARATION:<br />1.) Mix four-parts of coke to one-part of baking soda <br />in glass beaker. (Yes, that IS a 4:1 ratio) I&#039;ve done it <br />by eye &amp; found it&#039;s good not to exceed a 3:1 ratio.<br /><br />2.) Begin adding a few drops of distilled water to the <br />mix, adding only enough to turn the powder into a <br />muddy sludge-like consistency. WARNING: Do NOT <br />add too much water or your coke will not harden up <br />in the cooling process.<br /><br />3.) Drench the cotton ball with rubbing alcohol in a <br />thick metal or ceramic dish. Add only enough to <br />completely saturate the ball.<br /><br />THE COOKING PROCESS, <br />PART 1:<br />1.) Use the lighter to ignite the alcohol in the cotton <br />ball.<br />2.) While the cotton ball is burning, heat the <br />coke-sludge by swirling the beaker above the tip of <br />the flame.<br />3.) Continue swirling until the substance comes to a <br />boil, then remove it from the flame to cool.<br />When your substance has cooled it should form a <br />clump of solid &quot;rock-bubbles.&quot;<br /><br />PART 2:<br />4.) Add more distilled water to the beaker, enough to <br />stand about 1/4 inch above the hardened bubbles.<br />5.) Re-heat the substance in the beaker. When <br />thoroughly heated you will see a yellow mass <br />floating in the center of the water as you continue to <br />swirl the beaker.<br />You don&#039;t need to boil it, just heat it up until the <br />hardened bubbles melt into a yellow coke-mass.<br /><br />THE COOLING PROCESS:<br />1.) Once melted, remove the substance from the <br />flame.<br />2.) Continue swirling the beaker, (trying to keep the <br />yellow coke-blob in the center as you swirl) until the <br />water in the beaker has completely cooled.<br />3.) You should now have a solid yellow rock tinkling <br />around in your glass beaker. Remove the rock and <br />cut to desired proportions.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=34254#ixzz2cpGUk3rJ<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I know it&#039;s not as popular in UK as in USA, but I&#039;ve always assumed it to be fairly easy to obtain at street level, unlike meth.

Just ask any beggar who looks like a probable junkie (which is how I made most of my connections). Most of the dealers at that level tend to specialise in both white and brown (crack and heroin).<br /><br />As for meth, I&#039;ve yet to source any in this country. I&#039;m told that it&#039;s popular on the &#039;gay scene&#039; but I&#039;ve never been much of a clubber and it seems my sex life dried up before it became popular :)
