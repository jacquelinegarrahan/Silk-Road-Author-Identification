				The karma thing is kind of stupid. There are a very large number of stupid ass people here who will give - karma because of their own paranoid delusions. And people just going around randomly giving - and +.<br /><br />It really doesn&#039;t mean anything so don&#039;t get all bent out of shape over it.

				Oki then. Thanks for the reply and whoever balanced the books with the +&#039;s<br /><br />Hmm maybe a feature request idea is in here somewhere? A karma cop that can track the giving of the points and help put it back on track to what its supposed to be. Like most things its a good idea in theory but seems to be let down by the practical application in the real world situations. Haha is it ironic to police behavior on a forum dedicated to this type of market?<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />BanDit<br /><br />

I wrote a negative review in a vendor thread (honest &amp; correct, proven by lab-test), since then I got 13 or 14 downvotes ;D It took at least 2-3 weeks, pretty sure it was multiple accounts from one person. I just can&#039;t believe there&#039;s a lot more of these ocd people with paranoid delusions, who keep it going that long.<br /><br />So yea, such people exist. They don&#039;t have anything better to do than hanging out on SR the whole day. And they take this very seriously :P<br /><br />Very few people actually give out karma. This is not reddit :) I also almost exclusively use the upboat. But I also sometimes downvoted a whole page because I didn&#039;t like someone&#039;s avatar, comes with boredom and a lack of drugs.

				I think you have to be promoted to a regular member before you can even hand out karma, correct? And yeah I don&#039;t even know what posts were given the karma, unless you can find that in the settings or something.

Throw in boredom (can one exist without the other? Like lots of drugs ALWAYS means no boredom it stands to reason the opposite holds true) and usual social convention can just fuck off IMO! lol<br /><br />&quot;Can&#039;t we all just... have a bong?&quot;<br /><br />BanDit
