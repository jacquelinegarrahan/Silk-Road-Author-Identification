				Hey everyone. I am looking for Adderall, but the price on SR seems a little steep. Are there any other products that you can recommend that have similar effects to Adderall at a lower price? I am a graduate student at a university and am looking for a solid study aid.

				The usual response to this question is a group of 4 research chemical stimulants . &quot;4fa, 4fma, 2fa, 2fma&quot;<br /><br />There are one or two which are best suited for what you&#039;re trying to accomplish, but I cannot remember which.<br /><br />Also, modifinal (sp?) is another good one.<br /><br /><br />Might I personally suggest nootropics as a method of improving daily cognitive function without the harshness of amphetamine up/down cycles.<br />

				Well Amphetamine Sulphate would be your best option in my opinion considering it&#039;s cheap and a very good study aid. Just make sure you get good speed like boymaster&#039;s because a lot of it is cut very much hope this helps :)!

				AlphaBrain looks like it&#039;s a blend of nootropics.You kind of got shafted as it was probably just one ingredient that gave you the headaches, but you have no way of knowing which one. :(&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a bunch of aniracetam sitting in a drawer. One of these days I&#039;m going to encapsule the damned stuff<br /><br />.

				I definitely got ripped. I was new to all that so I went for it. I was not recommending them, unless you don&#039;t mind spending the money. The founder is pretty cool. He trips, and had an Ayahuasca journey in Peru. But now I sound like I&#039;m endorsing them. :o <br /><br />I have some piracetam and choline citrate powder that I&#039;ve yet to try, but that is probably the cheapest route (buying nootropics separately, as opposed to going with someone like AlphaBrain).
