				Good morning everyone!<br /><br />I was at a friends house last night and we just smoked a bit of weed - awesome weed might I add! My mate had a lot of Trance music that he was playing but he&#039;s a stingy fuck and won&#039;t give me the names of the songs (he wants the music to himself) so my girlfriend and I have set on a mission to find the best music to trip out to.<br /><br />I usually listen to Dubstep when tripping out but that Trance sounded so much better!<br /><br />I am expecting Pink Star pills from SKYY this week as well as some 25i NBOMe from DudeRugs hopefully next week so I am looking for the best music to go with these substances to give myself and my girlfriend the best experience possible!<br /><br />What would you say is the best music to listen to when tripping out? And do you have any songs you would recommend from that genre?<br /><br />I found one awesome Trance song that i think you guys might enjoy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnHtCxDXpgI<br /><br />The Godfather

				I think it&#039;s absolutely unpredictable. Some music that sounds &#039;trippy&#039; does not give you anything special while you&#039;re really high. And otherwise some really simple pop-songs can impress you with the &#039;depth&#039; and emotional impact. Just try it. The best thing I guess is to have a collection of random music and browse throu it when it&#039;s time.

				Here are a few popular mixes of EDM.&nbsp; Listen to a mix and see what kind of music you like, then look up the individual songs.<br /><br />A State of Trance - Melodic / Classical Trance, this is a popular mix hosted by Armin Van Buuren<br /><br />International Departures with Myon and Shane 54 - Available free online (google Myon and Shane), these mixes are groove driven and generally melodic.&nbsp; I recommend this.<br /><br />Global DJ Broadcast - Another major radio, this time by Markus Schulz.&nbsp; Trance that is slightly more Electronic<br /><br />Identity - Produced by Sander Van Doorn, this is my personal favorite.&nbsp; More electronic than trance<br /><br />Others you could check out - Corsten&#039;s Countdown, Future Sounds of Egypt, Trance Around the World (A&amp;B, very popular)

				Psybient (psychedelic ambient) is the ultimate trip music genre. Solar Fields and Carbon Based Lifeforms are notable artists. &quot;Blue Moon Station&quot; is a masterpiece album from Solar Fields.<br />Most of their stuff on The Pirate Bay. But I can upload some stuff to a file sharing site if someone is interested.
