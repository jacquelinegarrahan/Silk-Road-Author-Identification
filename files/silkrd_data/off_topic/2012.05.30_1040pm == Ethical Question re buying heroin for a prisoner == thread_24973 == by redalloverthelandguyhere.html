				OK then. I have never bought heroin and never used it although I was there in the 80s when that stuff was pretty much pure even on the street. I seen many friends become addicted so decided I would become addicted because I like drugs. I know heroin would be great! That first tine! but I know that people spend 30 years and enough cash to buy several homes chasing the original high!<br /><br />So I never used and would never buy any even when in the 80s I knew people who had pretty potent stuff that would get users nodding after one little &#039;toot&#039; on the silver foil. <br /><br />But now I got a situation. A real friend ended up in jail through doing what any man would do if his woman was insulted. Maybe he went too far as he almost killed the guy. So he is in jail. <br /><br />They test about every 2 months in his jail but using hash or bud he stands a good chance of being caught. He has never used heroin before but a few of the lads there have a Friday and Saturday night chill session. Makes them have something to look forward to I guess. <br /><br />Actually I know the answer to the dilemma. I will purchase the H. He is releasing cash to me and its not like its out of my pocket. I&#039;m not having anything to do with bringing it in but the jail he resides at is EASY. <br /><br />He wisely refused any gear &#039;on slate&#039; off the lads inside. He knew one of the dealers and was told on the quiet that they bring in a gram of street H cut to hell and cut that so there is just enough of an effect. Many prisoners do not use daily so tolerance is low. You can cut out opiates for a week and be blown away by amounts that would make a daily user barely feel it.<br /><br />So many prisoners get their own gear sent in. Coke is not so popular as who wants to be coked up in a cell alone or with some other guy? H is big as it lets you escape from things. <br /><br />So I obviously want the BEST quality (as does everyone) but unlike most users, I&#039;m not buying it for me and am H naive! You could show me any bitter brown powder and it would &#039;seem&#039; like it might be heroin to me. <br /><br />Anyone here who has ever been in prison? I have but never used inside as we never has all this piss test paranoia. You could smell the mostly hash after lights out. Screws who had sense understood that it was better to have the lads smoking a few joints than rioting. <br /><br />Its sad that prisoners avoid a harmless drug like cannabis and have to dabble in H!<br /><br />Some prisoners are ok once outside and do not need the H anymore. Depends what you get out to. Some people its not much so heroin is an option.<br /><br />So, I guess we would look at half a gram as I do not want to send in the same crap he can get inside. Price is about 10 BTC for 100mg of &#039;H&#039; which is 10-20% at best.<br /><br />He is inside for a few years so I need a vendor who is reliable and hope for recommendations as I am clueless over heroin. I know lots of people who sell IRL - not &#039;know&#039; them but I know people who know people. Even getting H off the man who sells to the kids who sell to the younger kids - its so poor that I could never buy bad drugs for someone else. Its worse than being ripped off myself! <br /><br />We could get hash oil in there but that stuff stays in the system for maybe 40 days. Someone got caught who swears they last smoked about 6 weeks prior to a test!! they smoked about 50-70mg of refined cannabis oil - chasing it on silver foil. Too potent!<br /><br />Meanwhile cellmates who done H on a Saturday and who got tested on a Tuesday were clean.<br /><br />I feel &#039;bad&#039; in some ways getting this H but he is a grown man and although most here use heroin, it is a big step for a non user to have to buy some!!<br /><br />I&#039;m in uncharted territory.<br /><br />So any ideas would be great.<br /><br />Should I &#039;clean&#039; the heroin I get?<br /><br />Or is the average H here decent enough as is? The guy will be smoking exclusively. Tempting though it is to deal in jail that is a move which you need muscle for as the gangs who do sell are not pacifists. My buddy knows enough people there to be able to get high without having someone asking why you are not buying their wares. He is the easiest drug to hide in jail from other prisoners. Cannabis oil can be refined to smell less (filter through charcoal) or water wash the starting leaf or resin! Wash in water and the substances which bring smell and taste will be washed away. Even so like I say you cannot do cannabis every weekend or so without being caught!<br /><br />As an off-subject - there was a hash called Sputnik and a batch was mixed with heroin! Whoever smoked this say down and nodded. We never knew what was in it but what a mix!!<br /><br />I will stick with hash but if ever back in jail maybe I&#039;d be a weekend user or a Friday nighter. <br /><br />So suggestions please to red!<br /><br />Please don&#039;t rip me off mr or ms or mrs H vendor!<br /><br />Don&#039;t d oa Tony on me!!! (Tony = notorious Canadian vendor who turned scammer and took us all for thousands of BTC whilst calling us &#039;brother&#039;. He is likely still here! gotta admit you were good! I got robbed sitting on my sofa smoking a joint. Way better than a street robbery with some &#039;yo - I#ll shht your motherfucking ass if you don&#039;t give me that motherfudding cheddar (cash)<br /><br />I got screwed, gently. Still hurt in the end. But things move on!

				I don&#039;t understand the question. Is it ethical to sell heroin to your friend who wants it? Is it ethical to sell heroin to an inmate? You said he&#039;s in jail but I&#039;m assuming he&#039;s in prison, big difference. <br /><br />As long as it doesn&#039;t get him killed by the wrong junkie finding out he has it, and you&#039;re not the one taking the big risk of smuggling it into the jail or bribing guards, then who gives a fuck? There are no ethics when it comes to the prison system anyways, on either side. There are a lot more dangers than heroin on the inside. Everyone has to find their own ways to pass the time, drugs, tats (hiv from dirty tat guns is common), chronic masturbation.<br />
