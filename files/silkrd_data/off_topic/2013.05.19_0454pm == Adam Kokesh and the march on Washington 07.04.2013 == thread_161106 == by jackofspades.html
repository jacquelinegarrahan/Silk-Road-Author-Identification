				So I&#039;m sure many of you have heard of the former Marine and congressional candidate Adam Kokesh. He&#039;s got some great stuff on youtube and his supporters on Facebook really seem to love him. He announced May 6 2013 he was planning to lead thousands of armed Americans from Virginia to DC marching with loaded rifles on Independence day of this year.<br /><br />I want to know what you guys think about this. Is this the spark that will ignite the powder keg of tyrannical government or will it not even make mainstream news? I don&#039;t think that a former marine is one to chicken out nor will his loyal supporters. <br /><br />I personally think it is a great idea and would love to see them succeed, i might even consider going myself but i stand too much to lose if i was arrested there. As i began writing this &quot;words i never said&quot; by Lupe Fiasco came on my computer&nbsp; :) lol<br /><br />So what do you think about Adam and this whole proposed operation?

				He just got arrested in Philly at a Marijuana Reeform (See what I did there)<br /><br />Not sure on charges nor if they plan to delay the hearing<br /><br />Bradley Manning all over<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been following him for a while. I would be at the march if I lived closer to DC, or had the funds to make the trip.

				I&#039;m ignorant so please educate me on this but is it actually legal to just walk around with a loaded rifle in public places?

Some states require the gun to be visible (Open Carry) while other State&#039;s you can cover and hide a weapon.<br /><br />Some State&#039;s will recognize a CCW Permit that has been issued in a different State while others will not. In order to find the information that specifically pertains to you where you are located, local Sheriff or a simple web search will suffice. <br /><br />I got my CCW to carry a Taurus .380 ACP in my vehicle or on my person. It was an 8 hour class @ 150$ and then a 100$ fee to the County Police Dept. - I try to target shoot once a month but with the shortage of ammo now, its been more like once every 3 months.

GoldenLotus sells a coupon pack by the way which has coupons for ammo. It makes it quite cheap and can also be made for different types of ammo I&#039;m sure if you ask him. Many of the people on his thread are quite helpful and might even make the coupons for you! Cheers.
