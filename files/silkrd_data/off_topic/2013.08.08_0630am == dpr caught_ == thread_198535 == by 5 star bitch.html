				He&#039;s probably been caught and is writing a huge list of all SR buyers and vendors along with their addresses and PM logs and forum logs to give to the FBI. He is then going to start working for the NSA and install Javascript exploits on all of our computers, and have all of our homes raided by the DEA. He will then flee to Russia and eventually be granted temporarily asylum. Obama becomes furious. Demands imprisonment of all Silk Road customers and forum browsers. Send them to Guantanamo bay. But first you have to be subjected to an anal cavity search by DPR himself. He then spits on you and you can see that he is wearing a 24 karat gold grill that says &quot;BITCOIN BITCHEZ LIKE IT DIRTY&quot; on it. Then you are tortured like Bradley Manning for the rest of your days, if only SR could have stayed up for a few more days, WHY DID YOU FORESAKE US DPR
