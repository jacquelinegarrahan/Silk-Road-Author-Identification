				I think it&#039;s a really good-intentioned thing, but idk... something about it feels really insincere and contrived to me. Like people are just spreading the word and getting angry because it&#039;s socially encouraged - if that makes sense?<br /><br />On the other hand, the guy IS a massive ass hole and he should be stopped.

				Yes.. Joseph Kony.&nbsp; One of the most horrendous criminals on the planet.&nbsp; I assume this is what you mean?&nbsp; The &#039;&#039;leader&#039;&#039; who commands his &#039;&#039;troops&#039;&#039; to rape and murder, yes?

				I completely support the cause, the man is evil and needs to be stopped.<br /><br />However the charity InvisibleChildren, ive read some pretty bad stories about them (eg apparently only around 30% of donations go directly to causes, the rest goes on salaries and making the movies etc).<br /><br />

				My heart goes out to the people who he&#039;s hurting.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; You re born in Uganda, and therefore you are forced to be raped, abused, tortured, used, etc, without ever knowing that there is an entirely different kind of planet out there, with peace, serenity, love, and honor.&nbsp; Think about never knowing the word &#039;honor&#039;.&nbsp; Now that&#039;s sad, never eat a hambburger, never watch a movie, never drink a clean glass of ice water, etc etc...<br /><br />So, I support the organizations like Faceless International and Invisible Children, even if they misguide funds, because:&nbsp; They are the ONLY organizations that spread the knowledge of his crimes!

I can&#039;t imagine that little going to the cause. The cause is just to spread as much publicity as possible. The InvisibleChildren organization isn&#039;t like other charity orgs where they either give money directly to researchers or provide aid. It&#039;s only purpose is to spread the word to as many people as possible and to make Kony a global issue with government support. If you think about it, wages and advertisement should count as a direct contribution to the cause. The goal is to get the US government to continue its support. So actually 2/3 directly go to the cause, and 1/3 goes to the Ugandan army.

I completely agree that he&#039;s an asshole and worth getting angry over. The whole movement though, at least on social networking sites, feels like a fad. Not that that&#039;s a bad thing, anything that can mobilize so many people for a noble cause is great. It just seems like no one is going to remember or care about this in a few months. <br /><br />I guess it isn&#039;t really a bad thing, just more of an observation. I don&#039;t know if that makes more sense, lol, it does in my head though!
