				You&#039;re def older than me!! ha.ha. ha. old fucker. hehehe. My 1st album was Santana - Black Magic Woman. My 1st concert was Metallica, and I was the youngest kid there. It was that way til I hit my teens. My folks got me into rock, and shredding guitars, but flipped when I brought a dub back of Metallica, Slayer, &amp; Anthrax. My dad destroyed my boom box, and whipped me unholy. This just concreted my love for Metal, and my rebelliousness. I STILL don&#039;t understand why he loves Santana, but not Dimebag. <br />

				Man, it is almost impossible for me to list all of the music in my life right now. I am a musician and have been listening to music since I was inside my mother&#039;s womb. My musical influence spans quite a lot of genres but to name a few though: Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Rage Against The Machine, Smashing Pumpkins, Tool, A Perfect Circle, Silverchair (older stuff), Pearl Jam, Sex Pistols, Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Exploited, Queens of the Stone Age, Mudvayne, The Black Keys, The Parlor Mob, White Stripes, Howlin&#039; Wolf, Son House, Leadbelly, Charles Patton, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Stone Foxes, The Doors....<br /><br />Shesh man I could go on for the next 10 pages but I would prefer not to...that is just the tip of the iceberg.

				My musical taste is very broad, overlapping multiple genres. My favorite band is the Sisters of Mercy (hope they&#039;ll release some new songs soon (or at all)) but I also listen to Rammstein, Pink Floyd, Massive Attack, Portishead, Rush, Tiamat, Smashing Pumpkins, Tool, My Dying Bride, Amorphis, Moby, Boudewijn de Groot, Dandy Warhols. More recently i discovered, and quite like, some drum and bass (Chase &amp; Status, Nero).<br />
