				Hey guys im starting this review thread so that my loyal customer base can review my products and services and hell who knows maybe win some more free spins and bets.&nbsp; Every month I will pick a couple lucky reviewers who really capture the essence of my services and they will receive $5 in VEGA$ BUCK$ for any sport bet or game of their choosing (As long as there&#039;s a minimum of 5 reviews).&nbsp; Hell you cant beat that, $5 for 5 minutes... I pay a lot better than Walmart&nbsp; ;)

				I too would like to brag on LVL a little bit. I had some questions about some things and messaged him, and he replied back and gave me help and some tips. I took him up on his offer for a free roll and won a dollar! I used some leftover coin to place a parlay bet on 3 football games this weekend. Wish me luck! <br /><br />So if you have leftover coin or just like to bet on sports, LVL is your man. As I said earlier, I&#039;m no gambler and he replied to my questions quickly and even gave some tips.

				Thanks for the love and support guys you have no idea how much it means.&nbsp; Everythings going great and running smoothly finally now if i can just get e3e3e3 to stop stealing my ideas lol,&nbsp; This dude had the nerve to ask for a free spin and steal my idea for sports betting all in my forum post which proves he is a fraud.&nbsp; All i can do is to keep doing right by my customers and hope that a loyal customer base follow because there will always be some lost soul who is trying to copy and paste themselves into a few games that they dont have the brain power to run. At the end of the day ive created all of these games in less than a week and i hope to bring you guys so many more.&nbsp; SO I GUESS ALL I CAN SAY IS I HOPE MY ORIGINALITY WILL PREVAIL AND PEOPLE WILL REALIZE THIS.&nbsp;

				Hey folks - just to say, LVL is the real deal.<br /><br />Inventive, responsive and follows through with payouts.<br /><br />His games give you the genuine possibility of winning bigger amounts of cash, without making the transaction a &#039;1 in a million&#039;.<br /><br />I recommend: Video Poker. To date, this is the most inventive game I&#039;ve seen using a transaction ID number.<br /><br />Peace!
