				I re watched Blood Diamond again, and absolutely enjoyed it once more! <br /><br />I must say Dicaprio&#039;s acting was very good, sure his South African accent may be a bit funny and a little too many &#039;eh&#039;s, but It makes<br />me want to move to South Africa (I know its mostly set in Sierra Leone on west Africa), pick up a whitemans sooth efricen accent and call everyone bru, while going camping, hunting, smoking Dagga and eating smoked ostrich...<br /><br />But that aside, for a 2006 movie its a great movie, good insight on illegally mined diamonds used to fund the RUF with arms, made me do my research on KPCS (Kimberly Process Certification Scheme) and how fake KPCs can be processed and &quot;conflict diamonds&quot; still manage to enter the rough diamond market etc etc. Some things in the movie might have been exaggerated but still was well done.<br />&nbsp;<br />Anyone got any movies to recommend, if it could be similar, following one bad ass protagonist, possibly in Africa as well lol... <br />I really like &#039;Danny Archers&#039; Character and the way he acts..<br /><br />Also, Movie Thread I guess :)<br /><br />

				A fairly different film to Blood Diamond but an absolute masterpiece, &#039;Children Of Men&#039;. Go watch it, I wasn&#039;t expecting much but was blown away but the story line and overall cinematography of the film itself. The story synopsis without giving away any spoilers, is that humanity has become infertile, specifically women. So slowly humanity is becoming older and dealing with internal political struggles with immigration and has basically become partly a dictatorship and the story follows a character sent on a mission to the &quot;Human project&quot; with his &quot;special&quot; cargo.<br />Fantastic film and fairly scary because its starting to look fairly similar to how society is headed currently, any way enjoy chap and tell me what you think after you&#039;ve watched it!<br /><br />Regards<br />PlanB :)
