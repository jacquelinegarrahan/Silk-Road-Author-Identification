				I like Bag Balm for my hands when they get a little worn/dry/cracked from working on whatever.&nbsp; Lather it on thick before bed and wake up to some sexy-time hands.&nbsp; Or at least they won&#039;t be completely destroyed...plus you can use it on the animals too!<br /><br />If I were to do a little side work at a ranch I&#039;d be packing a tin of it no question.<br /><br />Clearnet! - bagbalm.com

				I certainly don&#039;t fear it as much as you. :)<br /><br />I accept the fact I&#039;m breaking laws and am willing to pay the price if caught. Otherwise I wouldn&#039;t be doing what I&#039;m doing. No sense in living a life filled with fear and anxiety. That will kill a person faster than the drugs themselves. <br /><br />

That&#039;s just those registered, it&#039;s probably more like 2.5 or 3 million in reality.<br /><br />I mean, I take your point, anything that decreases the anonymity set is bad. But at the same time I doubt there&#039;s any DEA agents sitting up in their chairs thinking &quot;Busted! By God she has a horse!&quot;.<br /><br />I mean for one thing, half the things people say on here are red herrings. We drift among plentiful shoals of them. :)<br /><br />But to each his/her own, I won&#039;t judge (too much) ;)

				Well, I agree with username.&nbsp; It&#039;s not really paranoia so much as the simple fact that the less people know about you here the better.
