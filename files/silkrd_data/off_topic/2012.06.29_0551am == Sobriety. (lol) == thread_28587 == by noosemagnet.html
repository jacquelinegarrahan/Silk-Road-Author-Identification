				do any of you practice it? i&#039;m just curious.<br /><br />personally, i dabble with periods (days, weeks, sometimes two weeks) of sobriety. i abuse intravenous drugs for days or weeks and then i feel extremely guilty and i get worried i&#039;ll get addicted and i think about all the money i&#039;ve blown so i stop for a week or two. lather rinse repeat. <br /><br />what do you do when you&#039;re not using drugs? <br /><br />i&#039;m an unemployed loser so i post a lot of blogs (lacking substance) and play videogames. videogames are a great distraction<br /><br />xoxo

				I&#039;ve had periods of sobriety but my most used drug is weed so it doesn&#039;t really feel like it counts.

When I&#039;m sober I spend a lot of time learning things (so I read a lot of stuff), doing creative things [playing music, writing, etc], or spending time with my friends. I spend a lot of time writing when I&#039;m on drugs and then when I&#039;m sober I go back and write it into coherent literary pieces (I&#039;m a writer). But you just need to find something you like to do. If you&#039;re really crawling the walls I find socializing or being in nature makes it easier. <br /><br />Also, perhaps you could do some short training courses in your sober times to make yourself more marketable for a job? (excuse the assumption that this could help - for all I know you could be a doctor or something, but you know what I mean!)<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about taking tolerance breaks but then I think &quot;fuck it&quot;.<br /><br />It kind of sounds like you&#039;re struggling and maybe you want to try and be sober for a while?

				Sobriety is far too overrated. I have days I use and days I don&#039;t use. Some days I use one drug, some days I use multiple. &#039;Sobriety&#039; is a &#039;life choice&#039; to abstain from intoxicants. Fuck that. Life is too short and there is too much to to experience. Addictions can wreak havoc and make sobriety necessary for some I suppose but I try to check my shit and stay free.<br /><br />Back in the day I was addicted to coke and alcohol but I don&#039;t mess with either today.

Maybe a sport or something that can give a similar high (rock climbing, extreme sports) or any exercise (the endorphin release might give you a bit of a boost). Or just get out the house a bit - when I used to be crawling the walls for something and couldn&#039;t get hold of anything I&#039;d just drive around in my car with some of my favorite music, sometimes for hours and hours. Really works, particularly if you live somewhere where there&#039;s something to marvel at!<br /><br />Seems like you&#039;re aware of your use though, which is important. I think the worrying thing is that you don&#039;t seem to be enjoying life and/or engaging with it. It&#039;s easy to retreat into yourself with drugs and then it&#039;s easy to have a bad day and think &quot;fuck it&quot; and slam it instead of smoke.<br /><br />I&#039;m intrigued what your therapist&#039;s view is? Do they think you&#039;re addicted?

It did help, although I ended up being there a lot longer than the original 2 weeks suggested. And I was off &quot;drugs&quot; for months because of it, but they put me on tablets so swings and roundabouts. But following that I stopped all my meds and gave myself a true few months drugs break. <br /><br />I was also obsessed with using recreationaly before I went in. I was consciously aware of how much I was using and what I was using and the time of day I was using - &quot;is using at 8 on Sunday morning recreational?&quot; &quot;Does wanting to do xyz before going to see my parents count as recreational?&quot; etc. I was always much more concerned with the taking and the circumstances surrounding the using than I was with a particular substance (i.e. I didn&#039;t crawl the walls with needing a particular hit/feeling but rather more conflicted about when and where was appropriate use). But I definitely use recreationaly now and am much more chilled out about it and life in general is a lot better. <br /><br />I think you should go for it!
