				But I&#039;m gonna say it anyway.&nbsp; I got my gram of K today and have been a huge fan of MXE.&nbsp; I think MXE is the best shit.&nbsp; Hands down.&nbsp; Everyone kept saying wait til you try the K, it&#039;s so much better than MXE.&nbsp; MXE is K&#039;s little bitch.&nbsp; Alright.&nbsp; I accepted the challenge and I have to say that the amount of K I&#039;ve taken tonight, if it had been MXE I wouldn&#039;t even be at my computer right now.&nbsp; I&#039;d be trying claw out of a mother fucking M HOLE!&nbsp; <br /><br />Take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am fucked up on K.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m typing with one eye open.&nbsp; I feel it.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t feel as good as MXE.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; I said it.&nbsp; Banish me if you must for my blasphemy!&nbsp; <br /><br />anyway.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to hit yet another line of K and go lay down and listen to music and hopefully.&nbsp; This next line will be the line that knocks me on my ass and opens my mind to understand the true power of K!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />corny. i know.&nbsp; But I&#039;m really fucking high.&nbsp; But it&#039;s all true though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken the Pepsi challenge and MXE has come out on top.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				OK.&nbsp; After that last line I did last night shit did get real.&nbsp; It was a really nice trip.&nbsp; And the one thing that I will say that is better than MXE is that I had no problem falling asleep and the comedown was nice and easy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I think I have a weird metabolism with certain drugs.&nbsp; I ate an 1/8 of mushrooms twice in the past 6 weeks and they had zero effect on me.&nbsp; I think depending on the drug, I just need more.&nbsp; In saying that.&nbsp; If I had taken the same amount of MXE as I&#039;d taken of K last night I would have been completely gone.&nbsp; So now I know, with K, it&#039;s gonna take a certain amount for me to get a nice trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really wish there was a way to get into my head and record the soundtrack that&#039;s going on while I&#039;m tripping on K or MXE.&nbsp; The music is so fucked up and amazing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have had both K and MXE. MXE is one of the only RCs that I can honestly say is an improvement of the first. It may not get you quite as high but it is a much more fun functional high, with much less of a comedown and is considered much safer.

				That&#039;s cool.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried any other RCs other than MXE which is why I ordered a sample off of you (even threw in money for postage, I&#039;m no cheap cunt).&nbsp; RCs seem really cool and I&#039;d love to experience what they have to offer.&nbsp; In saying that, I&#039;m open to trying RCs but I&#039;m still scared to try Acid.&nbsp; Someone talk to me and change my mind.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m a product of the 80s drug scare about Acid and people losing their minds and shit like that.&nbsp;

It isn&#039;t so much short term safety but long term safety. MXE is supposed to have a much lower effect on your liver and has less harmful metabolites. This is partially because of the fact that it is more potent and thus requires a lower dose to achieve a desired effect.

				WHAT?!&nbsp; Afraid to try acid? It is one of the safest drugs you could ever try!<br /><br />I would say that MXE/K and messing with the nmda circuitry is more risky than disrupting your serotonergic activity. You are sadly misinformed and focused on government propaganda rather than pharmacological fact. While psychedelics certainly do possess the potential to precipitate latent mental disorders, there are many other drugs, including cannabis, stimulants, and especially dissociatives that also have slight risk. <br /><br />The NMDA circuitry is particularly important however, and drugs that are opposite in action to K and MXE are actually being used to treat schizophrenia... you should not be worried about lsd if you are not concerned about MXE. These circuits are extremely complex, far more complex than I can even claim to mostly comprehend... however, they are involved in memory and learning. The long term potentiation and synaptic plasticity is controlled by very fine tuned regulation and messing with these systems could antagonize any existing vulnerabilities. These receptors also play a major role in excitotoxicity and I am not sure on the verdict regarding their neurotoxicity in sub anesthetic doses.<br /><br />The dose of lsd is so absurdly small, the chemical is practically non-toxic (even too much water will kill...), and no vital lower brain functions are drastically altered, so acid is one of the safest drugs you could choose to ingest. It has an extensive history of safe human use, and ergot alkaloids are used as prescription medication, further supporting its relative safety.<br /><br />Psychedelics such as psilocin and mescaline have been used for thousands and thousands of years, and lsd is very similar... there is a reason people regard acid so highly. It truly opens your eyes and you experience the infinite universe, bypassing the confines of your mundane, restricted reality. In many cases the world will never quite seem the same, and you are just able to appreciate life more for experiencing something so absurdly, unimaginably different than normal reality... the experience can just be amazingly insightful, spiritual, creative, beautiful and many people harness these properties for self improvement which makes lsd a great tool if used correctly. In my opinion, acid is the psychedelic standard against which all others are compared (given mescalines rarity) and there is something special about it... <br /><br />Also, people hype it up though and make it seem worse than it is, if you use responsible low doses initially you arent likely to be overwhelmed and have a bad trip or anything. people freak out when they are in a massive crowd of people and take wayyy to much acid and you lose touch with your surroundings and even your physical body, which is scary and dangerous in the wrong setting for obvious reasons... if you respect the drug, you wont have any problems. <br /><br />Given the accessibility the road provides to obtain REVIEWED and CONFIRMED acid is a huge opportunity you should not pass up! The biggest danger of acid is being sold a RC by a fucking scumbag as LSD but not being aware of interactions/dosage/effects etc... taking a ten strip of acid will fuck you up, but not kill you. taking a ten strip of some of the RCs with crazy dose-response curves is incredibly dangerous however. Just dont pass up this rare chance and regret it. <br /><br />- miR

				I have never done any dissociatives&nbsp; but i do happen to be doing MXT for the first time tonight ! Ive read good things and me and a friend invested in some recently. Plan is to drop a 50mg gel cap and then maybe (probably) bump with another 50mg gel cap after 1-1.5 hours. Il post my opinion later :)<br /><br />On the subject of RC i must must must recommend AMT. I recently bought some to sell, not on SR, and tried it a couple of weeks ago and it instantly became a personal fav. A 40mg gel cap kept going for around about 12 hours and the cost to me worked out next to nothing, very cheap!. Incredibly euphoric, zero comedown (i actually felt better the day after i took it than the day before), pretty psychedelic. We did it in a controlled environment at home but equally my mate went to a rave on it a few days ago and said it was even better. Its made me content never to do MDMA again as imo this is much better, and legal in the UK.

				I personally much prefer MXE over K. Perhaps it&#039;s the strength. Perhaps it&#039;s the added opioid-like effects. Perhaps it&#039;s the fact it lasts longer. Perhaps it&#039;s the fact it&#039;s cheaper. Who knows. All I know though is I fucking love it. Favorite drug hands down.
