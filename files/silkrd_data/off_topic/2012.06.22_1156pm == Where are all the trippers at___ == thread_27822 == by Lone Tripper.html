				I&#039;m the last of the old psychonauts in my area, pretty sure. I was pretty deep into heavy LSD dosing about 15 years ago, i&#039;ve lost touch with all my old pals from that time as they have all moved away. Most people don&#039;t even know what LSD is here now. Last time I had a tab around here (about 4 years ago) I dropped at some house party, this posh chick ended up screaming all night because the devil was trying to rape her cleavage or some shit. Most people in my city like to get high by buying ipads with their dads money and drinking mocha cookie crumble frappuccinos.No one is fun anymore.&nbsp; ::)<br />I like to trip when I&#039;m active and with company so solo journeys are not for me.

I can&#039;t help but feel people are addicted to media nowadays, what happened to the good times where people just wanted to have fun because it was fun and not to get &#039;likes&#039; or &#039;views&#039; or because Justin Bieber told them too? Fucking all people care about now is getting drunk, showing off how &#039;cool&#039; they are because they smoke weed, and what so-and-so said on the boobtube. We&#039;re a dying breed alright, but at least we have Mother Nature to nurture us.

				Along with what Gary said, I think another reason us psychonauts are hard to find is because psychedelics are hard to find. You can buy a dimebag on pretty much any streetcorner in America, but shrooms are much more of a bitch to find. LSD and DMT even moreso. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think there is a lack of interest, just a lack of supply. I know plenty of kids who are into drinking and smoking to look cool who would pay top dollar for a bag of the worlds shittiest mushrooms just so they could say they&#039;ve done them. I know even more people who would legitimately like to try psychedelics but just don&#039;t know where to get them.

				I trip alone and the few that I have found are afraid to face life on LSD. I wish a vendor here had it cheap so I could run around the streets giving people sunshine. I guess it is a society issue and agree with why mdma/getting wasted is so popular just want there to be more of us in the world that are not that way.

Be the catalyst to opening their eyes that their life is nothing but a game.<br /><br />Its all about MDMA and inflating your ego. Giving one the false illusion they have confidence and everything is fine. Keep lying to yourself.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like to roll but I see why it is so popular. Its all about making yourself feel better because most people feel like shit because they are stuck in the rat race trying to get another dollar to buy some shit they don&#039;t need so they can feel more accomplished than their neighbor.<br /><br />The world is becoming more and more like Grand Theft Auto everyday.<br /><br />Hence why the majority of times I am tripping by myself, because my friends only want to get drunk and numb that pain of a wasted life. I rather trip and face it head on. I&#039;m not afraid of what psychedelics have to tell me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had this almost the exact same dialogue, damn near verbatim, in my head at around 1:20 am CST whilst driving home. If you were typing it at the same time it was entering my head. Mind = Blown. <br /><br />This only just reaffirms the giant mass of collective conscious that we&#039;re predisposed to gather all of our thoughts from - It is when individuals step outside that constant stream of information, be it meditation or substance guided, do new concepts truly become discovered and then added to the information mass where others can then comprehend as well. <br /><br />The Mayan civilization had no visual representation for a &quot;ship&quot; until a Spanish conquistador pointed to the horizon and said, &quot;there is where I come from, those are my ships&quot; - He drew them in the sand and when the Indians looked up, they now saw the hundreds of ships in the ocean. <br /><br />This is derp stuff bros
