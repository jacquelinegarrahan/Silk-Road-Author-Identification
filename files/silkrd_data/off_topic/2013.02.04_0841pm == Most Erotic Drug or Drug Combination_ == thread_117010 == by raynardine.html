				So I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research on this subject, and I would guess at this point that MDMA, Moxy, and Viagra would be the most straightforward and flexible.<br /><br />As I have mentioned before, I&#039;m into BDSM, and a few of my submissives have mentioned to me that they have an interest in drugs within the context of implied consent or pseudorape scenes.<br /><br />Before you object, I would like to remind everyone that rape roleplay is not real rape, because it is planned well ahead of time by the dominant, and consent within specific boundaries is implied if not express. It is the role of the dominant to surprise his or her submissive with encounters for mutual enjoyment.<br /><br />Drugs factor in because it would make a simulated rape roleplay that much more of an experience for the submissive.<br /><br />I&#039;d prefer something that can be administered orally.<br /><br />

				Way to be upfront about things! So I would think that Ketamine would be a fun one for subs, if they were lingering right at the brink of the hole it could make things seem that much more like a dream/nighmare, or whatever they are into....<br />But my personal choice would be GHB or it&#039;s faster-acting pro-drug GBL. Especially in a non BDSM context. G is a great erotic drug by itself and can make the user more open to sexuality and emotional openness. I am a not-very-sexual hetero-leaning male and when I use G I find myself much more attracted to all genders and it&#039;s an attraction that really seems to come from the heart. Anyone who has felt in love while under the influence of MDMA will know the feeling. It&#039;s like a milder form of the &quot;love drug&quot; with pleasant relaxing and euphoric effects. GHB and GBL are both on the Road, and I highly recommend everyone give them a try at least once.<br />Also, you may have fun drinking Absinthe during your BDSM and roleplaying encounters if alcohol and history are your thing.

				So I&#039;m trying Moxy this weekend and will likely follow it up with MDMA but I&#039;ve been doing a TON of research and I don&#039;t know that I really want to combine the two at the same time. The information is pretty conflicting though and I think the biggest issue is that Moxy is active at really small doses so people that have a bad time might just be taking a little too much Moxy with their MDMA. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be perfectly honest with you though, if you are looking for straight BSDM fun I think you might end up finding a little more joy from Meth (which is just fine orally even if it&#039;;s not taken that way very often) and a bit of Viagra if needed. Meth is without a doubt the king of energy and sexual boundary reduction. I&#039;m a bit of a DOM and MDMA is hard to get into that role on. There&#039;s just too much empathy to really get playful and the desire to gently touch and kiss is hard to resist. With Meth you will be able to fuck for hours and unlike MDMA the ego is amplified so entering into the DOM / SUB world is much easier.<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you know how the Moxy goes though once I give that a try. It&#039;s supposed to be pretty good as a relational enhancer but I don&#039;t know if it would fit in well yet with the detached sexual energy of Meth vs the connected sensual vibe of MDMA.

Pretty much anything that can be taken orally can be plugged. Meth is one of the easy ones since it&#039;s just a salt it dissolves real easy in water. It hits a little faster then oral and a little slower than snorting. Just search through the plugging posts and you should find plenty of info or ask me and happy to explain. With meth you&#039;ll probably want something for the come down, a little weed, GHB, xanax for instance just so you don&#039;t get into the fiending part of it. Fortunately, oral / plugging seems to have the easiest come down for meth but it&#039;s still good to plan for something to take the edge off. My advice would be to start with a pretty low dose, don&#039;t want to be spun, just stimulated and uninhibited.

I wonder if there&#039;s a reputable meth dealer?<br /><br />I have some questions specifically for you, DiamondSky.<br /><br />I have read that plugging meth has nearly 95-99% bioavailability. So I adjusted my dosage accordingly. My full dosage should be about 75mg. I will need a new scale, since my old one broke. For the pre-treatment week, I should take 20mg to sensitize my brain.<br /><br />Then I should take 75mg for the actual dosage, and I can take that much every 3-4 days if I want to.<br /><br />Is there any advice you&#039;d give me specifically regarding plugging meth? I noticed you mentioned that meth is a salt, and dissolves easily in water.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s time I started preparing for this.

				I&#039;ve never tried the &quot;pre-treatment&quot; idea before. I&#039;ve read quite a bit about it but it&#039;s really hard for me to say one way or another if it would actually be worth doing. The papers from which the pre-treatment suggestion seems to be drawn were not specifically done to increase the availability of meth or reduce harm so the notion of pre-treatment, from what I have read, seems mostly derived from an unrelated topic with some really odd dosing regimes. No real harm in trying it, as I recall the premise was simply to take a small amount over a few days to warm your brain up to the usage of meth which could than be done at smaller than otherwise needed doses for the same effect.<br /><br />Since doing meth all the time is in general a bad thing for most folks, pre-treating might be over kill unless you do plan to do it every 3-4 days in which case, yeah, go to town with it.<br /><br />For plugging I would start WAY smaller if you aren&#039;t a meth / stim user already 25mg plugged should be pretty well above threshold for a new user. If you wanted to try the pretreatment thing, you&#039;d be looking at something more like 5-10mg plugged to start off with and likely 25-40 for a real dose. Meth is not cocaine, it has a LONG duration and plugging hits within a few minutes so you can start small and go up a bit more if needed. Regardless of how high you might think you are though I would set a cap at like 50mg plugged or you&#039;ll likely be polishing the tiles on the bathroom floor for seven hours and not having any fun in bed.<br /><br />For the actual act of plugging it&#039;s pretty straight forward. Get a few oral syringes from Wal-Greens (10ml - normally free at the pharmacy, just tell em you need it for some kids medicine), pull off the plunger, place the dose in the chamber, reattach the plunger, pull about 3-4ml water into the syringe (distilled if you have it, less chlorine to mess up the drug), shake the syringe for a bit until the shards dissolve (faster if you crush to powder first), get a bit of lube on you and the syringe and push it on in. I personally just push it till it&#039;s all in, less leakage, officially you only need it about an inch or so in but expect some to come out if you try that. Then plung it on down slowly. I find doing this on the bed in a sort of fetal position helps and I just hang out there for 5-10 minutes before removing but if you can pucker tight it&#039;s safe to take out right away.<br /><br />Biggest issue...<br /><br />If you have to poop you&#039;re just gonna be injecting your stash into a pile of shit which you will immediately want to take. Soooo.... make sure you and your friends are all emptied out down there.<br /><br />Last but not least, plugging is amazing but it does bypass a billion years of evolutionary protections built into our bodies digestive system. You need to make sure you plug the right chemical (test it!) and probably don&#039;t want to do it too often or you&#039;ll probably have some issues down there. No personal experience on health issues but it does make sense that one would want to tread carefully since there are no acids or organs to process and breakdown what we shove in there. It gets into the bloodstream fast whatever it is so don&#039;t go too crazy...<br /><br />With that said, every week or so, known good chemicals in small amounts, should be fine.

				I was looking for some test for sex too a few weeks back so let me know if you find a good supply. The biggest issue just seems to be finding one that isn&#039;t going to make you grow man boobs or shrink your balls too much. Oddly enough there aren&#039;t a lot of recreational test users. Most seem to run it in weight gain stacks or take low doses for supplementation and I think those of us that just want to be a monster in bed from time to time would be somewhere in the middle. It&#039;s not hard to find different supplies on the clearnet as RC supplies. I used to order T3 for weight loss a couple years back from a site that had all the steroids I could ever want, I just didn&#039;t want any back then.<br /><br />Trying to search for the right test to take to boost sex functions just provides an endless stream of adds for &quot;natural testosterone supplements&quot; and links to recent studies in using test to boost female sex drive. So far can&#039;t find anyone that says &quot;One shot a week of such and such boosts sex drive in men.&quot; which is sort of what I would like to find.

				Posted this in another forum post but thought I would copy it over here in case you were curious on my own little Moxy lab tests:<br /><br />So I normally like to try things out before I put them into my girl just because if one of us were to fall over dead from some odd drug combination I would prefer it be me and not her. Yesterday I got a mountain of drugs dropped off on my porch and the two I was most worried about were the Moxy and the Xanax powder so I went about doing some experiments.<br /><br />My super duper nice scale from Amazon upon which I was putting most of my faith decided to be accurate to about 800mg despite it&#039;s claim of .001g and numerous attempts at recalibration. Fortunately, I have a 1-3mg scoop which will being much less scientific did help me eyeball some smaller doses before committing to using volumetric dosing for the real weekend adventure. So I started with the Moxy, plugging about 4-5mg to start since I figured plugging would get me past base line fastest with this substance.<br /><br />It hit pretty quick, 30 minutes or so and I could feel I was off baseline. Much more stimulating than I had imagined. Felt a little bit of that stimmed up heart in chest feeling but nothing uncomfortable, no shakes or anything. Having put the GF to sleep shortly after taking it I wasn&#039;t over the top with &quot;Let&#039;s fuck Baby&quot; or anything like that. I did toss in a little porn when she was out and it got me off pretty fast, the body rush helping the feelings come to life a bit faster.<br /><br />Never content with threshold, at 1.5 hours I plugged a bit more again 3-5 mg and this time the physical push continued pretty good and again my porn experience went quickly I noticed a little color enhancement but not extreme.&nbsp; It should be noted that since the first dose I needed to keep my little portable heater up pretty high as I was having a harder time keeping warm than I normally do. Pretty sure I thought watching a little more porn on this run would be scientific and it produced a similar result as earlier.<br /><br />Now, wanting to make absolutely sure I had a grip on Moxy and what it was all about at least under these testing conditions, about 1.5 hours past previous bump I plugged one more 4-5mg dose and at this point I think things moved just a smidge past threshold into more of a trippy set. Got a quick return to that anxious - too much coffee - type feeling, body felt nice. Porn was consumed Colors were intensified, no OEV&#039;s but watching a movie provided several moments where I knew what I was seeing was not nearly the same as what was there, brighter, more halo like apparitions with pretty decent color distortion. There were occasional side of field of view movements that left when I changed focus. One more porn experiment to test randiness, and was hard as a rock cumming very quickly.<br /><br />Of note, I don&#039;t normally jerk off 4 times in 5 hours so the real or imagined effect on libido seems to be there and cumming at those doses was no problem, quick even.<br /><br />Moving onto the Xanax, I thought I would test that to take tre edge off a little, I tend to have trouble sleeping after any new drug so thought I should give it a go.<br /><br />1.5 mg Alprazolam&nbsp; powder oral and didn&#039;t seem to hit me too much. Maybe a little calmer but hard to tell as I am new to this drug.<br /><br />Waited an hour and tried 1.5 mg more Alprazolam and this time I felt a little smoother but again not tired or out of it in anyway. Took my normal sleeping dose of Melatonin and Tylenol PM and realized I was a little mind fucked as I could not be sure moments after taking it if I really had taken it or not. <br /><br />Decided about 1 hour after last Alprazolam&nbsp; dose that a tine touch up might be in order so did one last booster of that at about 1mg.<br /><br />Woke up 12 hours later with all my clothes on in bed having no recollection of falling asleep or ever having become sleepy;<br /><br />So what I learned is Moxy is pretty good stuff, will probably go for a single dose of about 8mg next time to get where I want to be. Plugging provided NONE of the intestinal issues I was worried about based on previous reports so that was a plus. It seems to make things pretty awesome and when you get the dose right sex seems to come easily. There is definitely some body load associated with it in the form of tight chest and an occasional need to remind yourself to take a good deep breath but it seemed manageable. It&#039;s easy to want to push yourself higher but rumors of this turning full psychedelic at higher doses was counter to my goals of finding out if this was a sutible erotic enhancer. And at least the bag I go at lower doses does not seem likely to kill me or my GF when we play with it.<br /><br />I see this as something that would be fun for the start of our little trip since it&#039;s a function drug. Things can be done, head is still clear, everything just seems a little different.<br /><br />For the Alprazolam, I think a little more care / research is going to be needed. I wanted to have it handy in case things went bad but the dosing is going to be a pain and the effect are pretty damn subtle at least with mixed with the stim side of Moxy. At this point I will probably leave it off the rotation and give the GHB a try to see how that goes in it&#039;s place. <br /><br />I got a shot load of drugs in the mail the other day and I am thinking we might try the schedule mentioned earlier with a switch from the shrooms to a smaller dose (100ug or so) of LSD followed by ther MDMA chaser and then if we can handle it a touch of MDA to end the visual side of the trip before moving onto the 2CB.<br /><br />I ended up grabbing some local GHB for this encounter but I hope it goes down well and next time around I&#039;ll pickup some of BG&#039;s stuff. I ended up in more of a time crunch when it came to ordering as I was waiting for BTC to stabilize before I ordered but it just stayed high and I only had a week left so had to go domestic. I just got 15g for this adventure though and if it&#039;s handy for helping with some good long love / makepout sessions between me and my girl I can see wanting to have some larger supply on hand for weekend make out sessions.<br /><br />Appreciate all the advice and help coming from everyone here. Sorry if there&#039;s a little TMI in the post above but I like to be as honest and complete&nbsp; as I can since we are the only real source for information on how this stuff effects different people.

				Sex is pretty amazing on LSD. It&#039;s like every cell in your body is orgasming.&nbsp; It feels like it lasts forever too. Ten minutes feels like three hours. I suggest 200-400ug.<br /><br />I also like to abstain from all sexual activity for a couple of weeks, then have sex at the peak of the trip. <br /><br />MDMA is also good.

				I could never have good sex on drugs. I&#039;ve attempted sex on lsd...went nowhere. On stimulants it seems if I get it up it also goes nowhere. The Best sex IMHO for me has always been sober.

If I want to have sex when I&#039;m on MDMA for instance I tend to take a little less than my rolling face dose and I try to pop a little Viagra. Mostly the hardest part is being able to focus on the sex and not getting distracted by all the other stuff going one and lowering the dose really seems to help with that. Another trick that really seems to help is to start with the sex play before the effects of the drugs are hitting full on so the experience sort of morphs into a sexual one over time. Personally I think it&#039;s sort of a disservice for most of the drugs I use to say my only goal is to fuck when I&#039;m on them because often time most everything else is fun too. <br /><br />Stuff like LSD is more like a spiritual event that a physical one. While sex on Meth is more of a mechanical event than a sensual one. For folks that get to fuck all the time, sex on drugs is like going to a hotel without the kids and just being free to express yourself, feelings and desires through a whole new filter on life. Some folks take it too far, the whole PnP thing that happens with meth and the gay community might be a good example. Sex becomes that drug fueled energy and traditional sex can become boring. I try to keep it in the vacation category for me. Something fun and different that can fuel fantasies and break down boundaries for all the sober sex we have most of the time.

				Oh yes i agree.<br />Sober sex must never be discarded.<br /><br />As you also need a reference to see the difference.<br /><br />(althou i consider testosterone as sober sex when i have normal levels in my blood.)

				Just throwing it out there; though I agree most euphoric and stimulant drugs will naturally mesh with sex -<br /><br />25i could be some intense, fun experiences, at a dose right at the borderline of &quot;I&#039;m tripping too hard to fuck,&quot; because of its stimulant and euphoric effects, I just feel like it&#039;d be more of a mentally incredible experience as well as just the amplified sensations.<br /><br />Of course, candy-flipping would be the purer/better way to get those effects. 25i is just so cheap its convenient

				Well, I know that this is a sorta old thread; but I would like to add mdpv to the list of drugs awesome for sex.. especially bdsm. I like to keep a bit around specifically for such activities.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I happen to hate mdpv, and usually avoid oddball bathsalty stims. That being said, if you are a dom in particular I seriously recommend it. The stuff releases little or no serotonin so it leaves you crisp, focused, VERY inventive, and totally in control. It also doesn&#039;t cloud the experience like mdma or psychedelics have a tendency to do. It is a drug that complements the sex rather than the other way around. It also has legs for days, which is awesome in this context.<br />It even stomps meth by a mile imo. <br /><br />Edit: I forgot to mention specifically that it is great for non-consent type play as it seems to reinforce the detachment and amp up the physical intensity and catharsis all at once.<br />

				IMO you cant beat methylone+ghb+ cannabis. its not super empathic or cuddly but its very erotic and euphoric. Not to mention you will be able go for hours with the methylone in the mix.

				Moxy and MDA is really nice.<br /><br />But i agree, straight sex is amazing. If you have good testosterone, it goes a long way.<br /><br />High (natural) testosterone with good weed can really amp it up also. :)<br /><br />You want to really give your GF a good bang....work out, get ripped, and 2-3 hrs will fly away. ;)

				Rectal/vaginal insertions of any water soluble drug is the way to go, as far as sex happens with drugs... almost never with alcohol. Alcohol and sex is the pits, in my opinion. Too much pissing or dehydration or coordination issues, and a hangover the next day/night. Sex is very physical for me. I&#039;m very physically active, and sex is probably the only time I commit to an all out marathon. Rarely do I have sex less than an hour at a time.<br /><br />Stay high, my friends.

That said mdma makes for awesome mindless writhing.. Some dudes can have a hard time keeping a hard-on-on I guess.. 2cb is actually used in low doses in medicine as a aphrodesiac.. Soo, yeah it gets intense.. if you haven&#039;t had sex on psychedelics then you should..<br /><br />As for mixing both substances plus sex.. I havent done that yet.. <br /><br />
