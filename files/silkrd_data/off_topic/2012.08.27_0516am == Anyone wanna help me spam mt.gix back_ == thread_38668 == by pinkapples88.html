				Ok so I got one more PM and I got fed up so pretty much Im doing it back to them.If you want to help me go to live chat and ask if they like spam..Youll get banned from live chat.Then go to &quot;contact us&quot; and leave a bullshit name (I like shanaynay) preferably something realistic so they will think its a legit customer.Make up an email like &quot;gogogo@yahoo.com&quot; and keep putting shit like do you think spam is cute? I dont its annoying....and would you like it if I told the BBB (better business bureau about this little scam you got going here? .......Is this annoying yet? .....I can do this all day.....Im thinking about getting little spam bots like you...Please suck a dick.And so on.Its pretty much a desprate attempt to show them what its like to get spamraped day and night.If you got some time on your hands help out its pretty amusing and I bet after my 50+ messages theyre getting the hint and Im sure if a couple more people did it they would start to get pretty pissed.Anyway if youre up to it head over there and be a prick if not have a nice day!&nbsp; :D

				I did a portscan on mtgix.<br />Only ftp port21 port 80 and MySql on 3306 are open.<br /><br />Thor&#039;s hammer would be a far better solution.<br />That will put them down!<br />(But illegal!)<br />The scammer himself will not do anything, but the hosting server party could.<br />But it is TOR&#039;s hammer, so you will not be traceable when you Ddos yourself&nbsp; that server.<br /><br />That risk could be avoid by hiring a Ddos specialist.<br />To be found at black market reloaded for example. <br /><br />I blame Silkroad!<br /><br />If they wish they can ban the guy, but SR doesn&#039;t do that.<br />Instead they keep on deleting and he (mtgix) just paste it back.<br />SR doesn&#039;t do shit. So they do not how to cope with this, or they have other priority&#039;s and think it&#039;s fine.<br />Some invitation to others who would wish to do the same.<br />When there are over 20 of this kind of luaticks and no one else is visiting this site anymore, and inherent the mainsite will drop dramaticly in revenue&#039;s, maybe then will there be some action.<br /><br />Silkroad doesn&#039;t care.<br />&nbsp;They can easily do something about it, but for some reason they choose not to do anything.<br /><br />If we all stop ordering, that would help for sure !!!<br />Say it is no fun anymore to check a vendor out with all those spam from mtgix and move to BMR.<br />If we would all do so, I guarantee that within 3 days this mtgix fother-mucker will never show up again!<br /><br />wasta<br /><br /><br />

				Yea I hate this mothefucker. I have been telling them to go ahead and send me 100 bitcoin and I&#039;ll send payment<br /><br />I think it&#039;s law enforcement. I mean they are spamming the fuck out the forums with all kinds of different usernames. What can SR do anyway? A mod could just go round an delete the thread or lock it down i guess
