				Moonbear was hacked on the main site and on the forums. Same for my alternate accounts. I LOST OVER $200 USD. Whoever did it threatened to give out the addresses of my buyers, changed my passwords, and probably took all my money. Please help me, this isn&#039;t fair. I trolled a bit but I don&#039;t deserve this...

				Moonbear,&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly new on this site but, have been following your antics for a couple of months now.&nbsp; People on here have time and again warned you about your actions.&nbsp; Most have been patient and have been willing to cut you some slack because your young and inexperienced.&nbsp; We&#039;ve all gone through this phase in our life.&nbsp; But, your actions have become just too much.&nbsp; Your actions are threatening the security and safety on this site.&nbsp; Until you you&#039;re a little more mature and realize that your actions can put you and others behind bars you need to disappear and stay that way. You will not only be doing us a favor but, yourself.&nbsp; The way your going you&#039;ll be in jail within a year. <br /><br />I wish you the best because I do think that you mean well.&nbsp; Your just young, dumb, and way too reckless to deal with. <br /><br />1) Using a computer at school to access SR<br /><br />2) Facebook page with same name<br /><br />3)Threatening to release addresses<br /><br />Any one of these would have gotten you banned if I were a moderator.&nbsp; Your careless actions are going to be your downfall if you don&#039;t get yourself under control.

				moonbear is probably a LEO trying to bring bad light to SR but instead this vibrant, SAFE community is showing that we will not tolerate immature, underage drug use so now he is just trying to get any rise out of the community that he can. we are here because we as adults believe we have the right to put whatever we want into our bodies, but children are too young and naive to see how dangerous some drugs are. <br /><br />in all seriousness though. if his facebook profile was discovered and he really is a kid i worry about him and his parents. moonbear we only post this shit because we can see you need help and are lacking good guidance .. either that or you just are too immature to listen. i was never as stupid as moonbear appears to be but a long time ago i was a teenager too and didnt listen to authority.. if someone told me not to smoke pot i wanted to smoke 4x as much! nothing could stop me from getting high or drunk. but with age comes wisdom... and clearly moonbear has neither but is in much need of a reality check.<br /><br />id love to see this guys facebook account just for shits and gigles. i think everyone here knows who moonbear is. if the guy in this thread has his FB account still pls PM it to me im dying to see this kids profile to see if he is really as dumb as he seems. as a parent myself i am also concerned for his parents. if they are really unaware of how messed up their child is i feel bad for them. moonbear is risking his parents well being and safey by posting like an idiot online. what if his mom or pops has a couple grams of weed themselves that they are responsible with and keep it on the down low.. then one day their door is kicked in by the pigs because of moonbear and in the process of looking for moonbears drugs they bust his unaware parents?? thats not cool. <br /><br />I sincerly applaud the moderators decision to shut down his account. i would shut down moonbear2 account if it already isnt. and keep shutting him down. over and over... but one thing that isnt cool (unless im missing some details)&nbsp; is him loosing $200. thats a decent amount of change even for an adult. think that could by several oxys, almost a gram of heroin, in between 1/2 and a full oz of weed, or yes a nice dinner a red lobster. if money was indeed seized from moonbear i think the mods should make it right and send to his backup bitcoin address or speak to him directly and give him ONE chance to provide a bitcoin addy to send to. then goodbye moonbear from SR. <br /><br />babblepost over.

				Give the money back?! That should be considered an asshole tax.. and if you ask me he got off pretty light if that is all he lost. Think about all the stress these people are going to have that gave their personal info to this dumbass. You really think giving the kid his money back and reinforcing the idea that on the internet there are no real consequences for anything is the best idea? I say the mods SHOULD go out to Red Lobster or wherever on the kid&#039;s dime, what they do is actually work and they should be compensated for it. This was a tip for working overtime.

You messaged ONE user that left bad feedback and said &quot;Fix my feedback or I will post your address&quot; Then I banned you from selling. You continued to lie here, and say &quot;hackers did it&quot; then messaged the user and said &quot;That&#039;s it now I&#039;m posting it&quot; or something to that effect at which point you were banned from the forum and the main site. <br /><br />Your facebook was posted by another user, and plenty of us went through it. We know it&#039;s you, you leave your page public. <br />I deleted the thread for your safety. Now get off this site. Permanently. <br /><br />~Digi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ban me as many times as you like. Feel powerful? I&#039;ll just make new accounts. Waste of my time and yours.<br /><br />You didn&#039;t explain what happened to my alternate accounts. Ban those too? My buyer account had money in it. Takin your wife out to red lobster tonight?
