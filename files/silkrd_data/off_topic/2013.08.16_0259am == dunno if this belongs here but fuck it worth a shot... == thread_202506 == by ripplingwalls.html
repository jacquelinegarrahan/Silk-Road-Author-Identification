				ive been using tor only for the sr forums and sr. ive been on local bitcoin and other onion sites but ive never been to a clearnet email provider like gmail, aol, yahoo etc. so my question is this.....is it safe to access my email on any major email service provider while on tor and have an active tab on SR? dunno if that will jeopardize my safety by exposing myself. sorry if its a noob question, im aware it is but its just ive been so paranoid i dont go to anything else but Sr, the forums, google and onion pic uploader links lol so any input is appreciated thank you all

				This would be best in the security forum but here&#039;s your answer.<br /><br />When using Tor and going to SR your data is encrypted on your computer, sent to an entry node and then on into the Tor network. It bounces around through some relays and ends up at SR where the final layer of encryption is shed and you are connected securely.<br /><br />When visiting a clearnet site via Tor you are going to an entry node, bounced around the relays, and then to an exit node where your final layer of encryption is shed. From there you are back onto the clearnet and your final destination. This exit node will be able to see where you are going and what you are doing so if you log into one of your accounts your anonymity is gone. If you visit another clearnet site you are still no longer anonymous. If you change your browser&#039;s identity then you are given a clean slate and can start again with your anonymity back.<br /><br />Since SR is a hidden service you will not be revealed by using a 2nd tab in the same Tor session. Using Tor to visit clearnet sites where you identify yourself is a bad practice in general. While it may be ok in this one case where all you are doing is using a hidden service, the better practice would be to use your regular clearnet browser for regular activities, and the Tor browser for anonymous activities.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Use your Tor browser when being anonymous.<br />Use your clearnet browser when using your &quot;real life&quot; identity.<br />Don&#039;t confuse the two or you are going to have a bad time.
