				u kno if u dont drink waters when u take da mollys u die. But yeah, be prepared to be bouncing to any music you hear. I like doing it at night personally because the lights are beautiful. Id suggest you take ~1mg per pound(of your weight) for a good solid roll. Keep water on hand and be prepared to sweat more than you want to. Be care free and have a good time.

				Are you taking it orally or insufflated? For a first timer, I&#039;d eat 100mg for a pretty decent roll. If you&#039;re snorting, start with a little less than that--perhaps half--and work your way up. When it comes to trying drugs for the first time, it&#039;s always best to start small and build your way up to your sweet spot. Play some music and have some drinks handy. OH, and fuzzy blankets. Enjoy. =)

				Yes but i would not recomend to much public for your first time because you don&#039;t know how obvious you&#039;ll look if your not used to rolling.weed is great to smoke&nbsp; and Pink Floyd is so much better than usual.Save the sex for a few hours so you can enjoy the whole expierience othe wise you spend the whole time fucking .Wich is not a bad thing at all,but rolling is so much more than sex.The sex however is magical!

				Sub&#039;d in for the roll report&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Dose 150mg for first 4 hours, top up with 50mg for each time you need a extra hit but cap it at 250mg for first time roll otherwise you might over cook yourself.<br /><br />Enjoy weed4me&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Tomorrow you should get outside into the sunshine and eat some bananas, if you can go for a swim in the ocean too that is a guaranteed come down cure.

I rolled for the first time and it was a blast. Today it sucks because i&#039;m on day 3 of benzo withdrawals and feeling the after-effects of yesterday&#039;s experience. Back to the point. It was sure sketchy to try to explain to my wife that the rapid eye movements was &quot;nothing. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s causing that. I haven&#039;t taken anything.&quot; Lol you can control your speech and actions, but those fucking rapid eye movements are gonna happen no matter what and you can&#039;t stop it. At least i couldn&#039;t. Stay safe and out of public.

				Aww mannn.....I just realised that I can&#039;t remember the first time I took molly.&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; &nbsp;I do remember chasing the fabled &#039;Green Mitsubishis&#039; back-in-the-day, but now that I&#039;ve had pure MDMA I know that there was some very active other cuts in that shit.&nbsp; Kids today are so spoilt!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I think this experience and the subsequent advise is why the internet and liberal minded people can be so great.&nbsp; Anyone whose taken molly knows how safe and fun it is, and with online advice and mentoring, its only safer and MORE fun.<br /><br />Back in my day, it was &quot;Here, eat this it&#039;s called Ecstasy or something and it&#039;s awesome!&quot; followed by the reply &quot;Sure, why the fuck not&quot; followed by an 8 hour spazzed out rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />That might sound fun, but you have to respect the chems or you&#039;ll find yourself thinking one day that jumping off a balcony is fine because, you know, you can fly.&nbsp; ;) ::)<br /><br />This forum, bluelight and erowid are such amazing resources of positivity and real info, that in the past 2 years I&#039;ve safely and easily tried more different types of chems than I did in the previous 10, and had a fucking great time doing it, thanks to all you fine people.<br /><br />Information is king&nbsp; :)
