				Like many of you I have been part of a wheelbarrow full of different forums. From Xbox to Internet Marketing to Pickup I have seen a variety of different people interacting through the internet. That being said, I have never encountered a better group of people then my fellow Silk Roader&#039;s on here. You guys are amazing! I was thinking about this last night as I fell asleep. I was trying to figure out first; what exactly I liked so much about these forums and secondly; what was responsible for this. Here are some of my conclusions. Probably not groundbreaking by any means but I think it sums up some different ideas well. <br /><br />I think these forums are remarkably judgement free. This strikes me the most as I read through here from Rumor Mill to Off Topic. I see so little judging and people putting other people down it really astounds me. Everyone always seems so positive and happy, I love it! Maybe it&#039;s because people are high all the time but I don&#039;t think it is that. For me at least, my happiness comes from knowing that a subversive community like this not only exists but thrives. <br /><br />What I was really thinking about though was why is this community so close knit? Again not groundbreaking but I really came to the conclusion that our underground culture is really responsible. Everyone here is taking some degree of risk and we are skirting our respective countries laws. This really seems to all put as together in a very small boat that encourages cooperation. I think it is hard to judge one another when we are all to some degree fucked if ever found out. <br /><br />Wow, this whole post sounded alot better in my head than it came out on paper. Disappointing to me but I gave it my best shot. What I really wanted to say is that I love these forums! They are the best I have ever been a part of. As a general rule I do not really like small communities but if I could live with all you guys in the real world I would do it! As long as you didn&#039;t steal all my drugs lol<br /><br />One final note, I had the idea for this post and did the subsequent posting completely sober. I know you guys would not judge me but I think it adds a hint more credibility that my un-inebriated brain did all this<br /><br />~SavoyFan

				No but really, you&#039;re right. I feel like this community is very closely knit, we&#039;re the kind of people that will have your back if you need us. Of course I can&#039;t speak for everyone, there are some people who prefer to observe from the outside without being really involved, and there are some who are just assholes that refuse to be part of our family, but who needs them anyway? :)<br />When I first joined the Silk Road, I was also shocked at how friendly and compassionate the people in this community are. I wrote a post similar to yours a long time ago, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s gone now, but in it I was very emotional. My post, though, was about how hurt and sorry I was that these are the kind of people that society will always see as scum, we are all criminals and liars and thieves just because we refuse to do what big brother tells us. These people here are literally the BEST people you will ever have the pleasure of meeting in your life, they are the most honest, the most caring and simply the highest-quality people you will ever ever find. <br />Hell yeah I get preachy when I talk about this community, I probably get the more eye-rolls, sighs and &quot;oh she&#039;s at it again&quot;s than anyone on this forum, but damn it I have so much pride and faith in this community! If the Silk Road formed into a cult, I&#039;d join it in a heartbeat LOL! It&#039;s just so amazing to be part of the revolution. I know alot of people think I&#039;m an idiot for selling pet meds on the Silk Road, but those that do don&#039;t know how many people I&#039;ve actually helped. I know though, and that&#039;s all that matters. I&#039;ll quit rambling now, but seriously, I just love you guys so so much! :&#039;)

				I definitely feel you on the lack of negative judgement here.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a refreshing breath of sanity to have people that are willing to have frank conversations and give helpful advice.&nbsp; Not going to lie, I always feel a bit huggy when I&#039;m on these forums.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t like to speak for others, but I know that after seeing how some of the people in the world judge me, I try my best to be accepting of everyone.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use an action to judge a person, I know I&#039;m not the only one here who has been on the wrong side of that, but I think it has helped me to see everyone as a person rather than a decision I may or may not agree with.&nbsp; :)

				Because the trolls haven&#039;t found it yet, at least I hope not.<br /><br />Seriously though it does have a great vibe here, <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that trips can be induced just by being around those who are tripping, I wonder if the positive energy can get around the deepnet as well?<br /><br />None of us probably fit into regular little boxes for societies peoples like most people want you to do, maybe we are less judgmental because we are the ones that those people like to judge?<br /><br />Because we are high and yet clear enough to get here?<br /><br />Seems like there&#039;s a lot more interest in psychedelics and inner exploration than just getting fucked up to get fucked up, so you&#039;ve got some incredibly insightful people around here.<br /><br />We&#039;ve all had to deal with our own daemons?

				I was thinking about this the other day.&nbsp; I LOVE coming to the forums.&nbsp; The people here are really fucking cool and there is the shared interest in drugs.&nbsp; I have no friends who are into drugs (other than a few who smoke weed) so it&#039;s nice to read what&#039;s going on, get advice and start to learn some things and to give advice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been into any other forums so it&#039;s nice to have a place like this to interact with others.&nbsp;

				I agree that a lot of us are cut from the same cloth so to speak. By and large, we&#039;re critical thinkers who refuse to bow down to arbitrary restrictions on our personal freedom, even as many people see this as criminal or downright evil. But there really is a warmth and depth here that is rare anywhere, and IRL not a lot of people can relate to these things, maybe a handful if you&#039;re lucky. This place is also a beacon of hope; hope that state power will not have the final say in our lives, and to me that resonates deeply. It also fosters a bond between us. Everyone here wants to see this succeed, and knows what&#039;s on the line in trying to make that happen. As cliche as it sounds, this place truly is revolutionary, and it pleases me to take my small part in it. There&#039;s also some real intellectual firepower here that I try to soak up as much as possible, it&#039;s a huge draw for me.<br /><br />Of course, extremely high quality drugs don&#039;t hurt either ;)

				It really is an amazing phenomena! I think what everyone else has stated all wrapped up in a ball. You get the odd scammer scum, troll, or just a too full of shit wanker, but in large I have made some awesome (dare I say it) friends. I think we are all in the same place and its pretty much live and let live! <br />Some of the people I would imagine hanging out with and sharing a beer (and illicit substances ;)) Some amazing vendors, and the biggest realization we are just not the stereotypical&nbsp; &quot;junkie&quot; the vast population believe. (Biggles being the exception, he is just a coke head, no more no less &lt;3 you man) Don&#039;t get me wrong I love to dribble shit more than the average Joe.&nbsp; I guess the community is just more tolerant to put up with my shenanigans! (love this word, it&#039;s just not used enough IMO)<br /><br />All in all I hope we are all around for a long time to come!<br /><br />Bestest Hoffa 8)<br /><br />ps. yes I am high lol
