				So it seems the geniuses here at SR have the shipping of illicit goods down to a tee and despite LE&#039;s best efforts they&#039;ve barely been able to hedge the situation. The reason for this is complete discretion through anonymity and from what I&#039;ve been reading the only interpersonal contact involves taking to a package to the local shipping branch. Everything else is a string of 1&#039;s and 0&#039;s.<br /><br />However, I&#039;d really like to pick the brains of you guys on how you would go about selling locally. <br /><br />The advantages are: a larger market and more constant demand, and more immediate returns.<br />The disadvantages however are less anonymity and closer proximity to your grow house.<br /><br />I was curious how you guys would go about hedging the problem of having face to face contact with people. We all know two people can keep a secret only if one of them is dead so the only way to protect your security is by taking extreme, sometimes paranoid countermeasures. Lets look at the phases of a for-profit grow:<br /><br />A. The Grow:<br />This is the phase of securing a grow room, keeping tabs on exactly who knows about it (if any), whether it&#039;s legal in your state for permit reasons, setting up and supporting your infrastructure and resources (lights, water, nutes, etc) harvesting, and packaging.<br /><br />B1. The Intermediary:<br />The phase of having a buyer contact who distributes in the local area. This is an individual with contacts, giving him access to a huge local market. The pitfalls almost always occur in this stage. If the contact is foolish he may attract LE attention. Hell, lets assume that he&#039;s a dumbfuck and WILL eventually attract LE attention. If this individual has ANY knowledge of you, your house, your operation, any of your other contacts, he (or she) will gladly turn it all over to LE for amnesty and a free walk. I&#039;ve come up with a few ideas for how to curb this problem which will be addressed in a latter section.<br /><br />B2. Direct Distribution:<br />This is an alternative to having a contact who sells for you. It allows you to control the security measures of the buying process, but it also involves a lot of running around and dealing with people. If you&#039;re caught you can&#039;t very well give up your grow location for amnesty so its secure for a time. Also, it&#039;d be hard to have enough manpower in one person to distribute and profit to a vast market while maintaining your grow op, even if it&#039;s mostly automated. The benefits are that you don&#039;t have to sell at a discounted price or keep ties with a questionable contact, and you know how where and when to sell and which people you can recognize as buyers.<br /><br />Notes:<br />i. Market:<br />Which areas would be good to sell in? Factors like police presence, community profiling, transportation, and social security must all be taken into account. For example, if you have many middle aged work-a-day honest buyers in your area, the need for a contact is greatly diminished. These people attract little attention to themselves and mostly go about their every day lives undisturbed. However, if you&#039;re selling near a college campus or multiple campuses you&#039;re dealing with people who have tons of social contact, take risks, run their mouths, but you have access to a MASSIVE market in the form of fraternities, and as a bonus most issues are handled by campus police which give very few shits about marijuana, the most they&#039;ll do is contact the local authority with the information they have. They won&#039;t launch a huge investigation or set up sting operations.<br /><br />ii. Contact:<br />It seems self evident that the need for security comes above all else. Everything from your house location, the name associated with it, any unwanted visitors like electric workers or firemen must be taken into account. Theoretically you can avoid having your name tied to a rental house if the landlord is apathetic or is knowledgeable and cut in on profits. He, however, could turn on you on a dime over any disputes and he must also take into account his own legal liability.<br /><br />Your involvement with buyers must also be closely monitored. If you have 3 or so dealing contacts you have 3 times the risk that one of them will be questioned by the police. For this reason it&#039;s imperative that your contact has no information whatsoever as to who you are on paper. But since you aren&#039;t dealing with businesses and there&#039;s no need for proper ID or records, using an alias seems perfectly valid so long as each contact only knows you by a specific alias.<br /><br />Also, contact with the police. A local operation will inevitably result with a traffic stop by the cops possibly while you have some product. Knowing what few rights you have and politely requesting that they be adhered to can save your ass in the long run and having clever secure storage while in transport could delay or prevent police from accessing anything without a warrant.<br /><br />iii: Communication.<br />This is a hurdle. Ideally any contact you have with your dealers should take place with nothing incriminating on your person as it makes it far too easy to be entrapped by police. To achieve these circumstance the only solution I have come to is a system of dead drops, and communication over encrypted TOR channels. These further complicates the problem, because while there is less chance of being caught red handed, any observer could get a little too curious if your drop location is poorly chosen, or if your contact makes foolish decisions. Also, it requires a similar system in order to receive payment. In urban areas, metros and city buses can provide a good level of moving anonymity but its yet another hurdle your contact must be willing to jump with you.<br /><br />I&#039;m very interested to hear what you brilliant folks here on SR think about these issues and the unique approaches you would take to overcome them. We may very well soon be in an economy where the only product and service that retains its value is drugs and drug dealing. None of us want to have happy fun time with Bubba at the local lockup, so get back to me with your thoughts.

				Its 2012 man.<br /><br />Just do deals online. Look at any vendor on here who is a decent vendor, they charge whatever they want and still are absolutely swamped with orders. You can charge top dollar or bottom dollar and move product quickly here. Just about every aspect of this is safer than dealing in person. Selling the wrong thing to the wrong person physically can get your house raided. Selling online and using every precaution to disguise your identity through latex gloves rubbing alcohol and using a mule to deliver packages is almost impossible to have tracked back to you. <br /><br /><br />Bitcoin and money laundering are a different story though. Thats where the in person meet ups out weigh the online distribution.

				Lol, you think I&#039;m police? I haven&#039;t seen any other topics like this, but then again I&#039;m not on the forums all the time. I posted this as a community effort to understand how to go about local selling from the experience of the people on here. Not asking for personal information or anything of the sort.<br /><br />A good system (such as SR) is one that is so airtight that it doesn&#039;t matter if the police know HOW you do it. I&#039;m merely interested if anyone has attained this level of security in person.

				Selling locally is too risky. I know a lot of local dealers from small to huge. I personally would never sell locally, I get enough anxiety from selling on here as it is now imagine selling locally?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Out of all the dealers I know, only one of them hasn&#039;t been arrested but that&#039;s because he uses people, manipulates them, and then they take the fall for him (mafia/cartels anyone?) <br /><br />I would never be able to do that but that&#039;s the only way to not get caught is to use other people so it&#039;s either you have a fall guy that&#039;s going to go to jail or you go to jail but trust me eventually you will get caught. Might take some time but you will whether you&#039;re selling grams of weed or kilos of cocaine. The problem is that LE have a lot of resources/power locally and require minimal amounts of those resources to catch you. Think about it all they have to do is send one patrol to your house after they get a tip that you&#039;re dealing and then what they do next is wait for someone to be walking out of the place, arrest them, and intimidate them until they fess up and then they turn them into an undercover. That person then calls you again one day and ask to buy some stuff, you&#039;ll be none the wiser and sell to him, he walks out as the cops are storming your place. That&#039;s typically how it goes and like I said whether you&#039;re selling grams of whatever or kilos of whatever you&#039;ll get caught and serve the time deemed fit. You can be clever and think outside the box but eventually you&#039;ll have to use people like the mafia/cartels do.
