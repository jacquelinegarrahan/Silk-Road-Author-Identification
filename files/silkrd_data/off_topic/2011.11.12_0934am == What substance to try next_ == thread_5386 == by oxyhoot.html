				So I have tried all the major stuff except for H, but I love my prescription opiates, so I know I am down with the opioids. I have tried all but the most exotic. Oxycodone is by far my favorite (big surprise, right?)<br /><br />I love me some good weed, been an almost everyday smoker for a little less than 20 years, so there is nothing new for me there.<br /><br />I of course have tried coke (love it) and speed / meth (like it but not to get tweeked, just a boost.)<br /><br />I love Valium, but think Xanax, Ativan, and Klonipin are just OK. Can somebody recommend another benzo I might like?<br /><br />I used to do a lot of acid and mushrooms when I was younger, but the desire to do them anymore just isn&#039;t there.<br /><br />I want to try DMT. Can somebody please explain the high briefly and recommend snorting or vaporizing? <br /><br />I also want to try MXE. Same thing, can somebody briefly explain the high and recommend snorting or vaporizing (if MXE is vaporizable?)<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any replies!<br /><br />oxyhoot

				&quot;I want to try DMT. Can somebody please explain the high briefly and recommend snorting or vaporizing? &quot;<br /><br />I never really thought of smoking DMT as a means of getting high,<br />the trip it&#039;s self is 5 minutes and you can read about it on Erowid.<br />I would strongly not recommend snorting. Buy some freebase and an ubie.

				I recommend you do MXE, im on it now and i love it, if you have never done a dissociative you wont really know what its like until you have done it, but yeah that and a opiate high, smoking it works alright as well with weed, gives you an opiate like rush.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4685.0<br />Read this thread if you are serious on doing it and want to read others experiences and stuff on it.

				oxyhoot, etizolam is a lot like Xanax but with a pronounced euphoria and shorter duration of action. It&#039;s the best benzo out there atm.

				if you havent tried mdma, you MUST. Also nitrous oxide is pretty awesome<br /><br />DMT: i would compare it to a medium strong acid trip times 10 that only lasts 5-15 mins. snorting dmt is extremely painful, not the best way to go into a super strong psychadelic experiance

				Un, yeah, don&#039;t think I will be trying H anytime soon. Already too fond of the prescription stuff.<br /><br />Bitshopper, thanks for the info on etizolam. I have been wondering about it. If I like valium I should like etizolam, right?<br /><br />Waiting patiently for my MXE. Starting to worry, marked in transit within 24 hours and I has been over 7 business days now. Supposed to be domestic. Seller has good feedback though So I&#039;m gonna wait it out.<br /><br />Thanks to drugsbunny for the MXE on weed suggestion. Going to give that a try for sure.<br /><br />I want to try MDA/MDMA (is there a big difference?) but I&#039;m afraid to order from the Netherlands and most of that seems to come from there. I also want to try AAKOVENs pink champagne speed and the price is fucking amazing but again I am afraid to order from the Netherlands. Seems like a crap shoot.<br /><br />Jesusjoints, when I said smoke I meant vaporize. Are all the ubies gone from SR at the moment. I guess I could look for myself.<br /><br />brockh I love nitrous!<br /><br />Thanks everybody!<br /><br />oxyhoot
