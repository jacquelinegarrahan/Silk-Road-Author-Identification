				Come on there is more than 200 of you guys who have received drugs from me.<br /><br />Can you +1 me on the forums if you have received a product from me and enjoyed it.<br /><br />I post in the vendor forum a lot and that is where I got all the -1&#039;s.

				Karma ratings on the forum have nothing to do with a vendors performance on the main site. The Karma ratings are specifically for people liking many of your posts, or disliking them. It appears you have accumulated a lot of negative karma, which tells me that for some reason, a lot of people don&#039;t like the posts you make. I don&#039;t have access to the vendor forum, yet, so I don&#039;t really know what goes on there. Me personally, I never give negative Karma unless a post really pisses me off, which isn&#039;t that often. You must have pissed a lot of people off :(

				I don&#039;t have enough posts to get to the ability to give out and Karma here, but if my package comes from you as it should, I will fully write up a great review for you here.

				@CabinBoyNathan <br />My forum review thread is here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=185315.0<br /><br />You can +/- after 100 posts I believe if your wondering<br /><br />@missnatural I do not think I really ever pissed anyone off in the forums, maybe it is just vendors jealous of my success -1ing me
