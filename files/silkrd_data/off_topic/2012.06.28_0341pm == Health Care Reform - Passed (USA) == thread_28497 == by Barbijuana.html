				Judicial review just ended on Obamacare and 6 out of 9 Supreme Court Judges just deemed Constitution. The individual mandate was also upheld. <br /><br />Ya&#039;ll hippies that don&#039;t have health insurance provided through a job can now be fined/jailed/punished for not purchasing and carrying Government provided individual health insurance. <br /><br />So.<br /><br />What the fuck happened to the Land of the Free?<br />

				The US is getting way out of control, especially in the last 10 years or so. The whole net is wiretapped, and they&#039;ve been stonewalling the EFF&#039;s investigation. They&#039;ve summarily killed at least two US citizens without due process, and are routinely killing innocent people in other countries with drones. They declared that Internet-based attacks would be considered acts of war while simultaneously working with Israel on advanced malware to sabotage Iran&#039;s nuclear reactors. Now they&#039;re trying to make basic investigative journalism illegal. When they leak classified information to the press that glorifies the president, it&#039;s fine; but if you leak information regarding government crimes, you&#039;ll be prosecuted for espionage. And needless to say, it doesn&#039;t seem to matter to anyone in the current government how high the piles of severed heads in Mexico get as a result of its stupid, insane drug war.<br /><br />Obama has been even worse than Bush on virtually every important issue. After this upcoming election, barring a miracle, the US president will be either 1) the same guy who&#039;s demonstrated he&#039;s unfit for office, or 2) the other guy, who is still struggling to differentiate himself from the president.<br /><br />All Americans need to keep their eyes open for ways to help. I&#039;m not optimistic about turning it around, but we won&#039;t feel right later if we don&#039;t at least try.

				It is just a hidden tax like inflation. Families and individuals that don&#039;t carry health insurance through a company are now going to be forced to shelling out hundreds a month for Government Health Insurance or otherwise face criminal charges. <br /><br />How do you tell someone living on the streets or supporting a family on a fixed income that they now have to pay for something they may or may not use. Not to mention, if you&#039;ve ever served and tried getting anything processed through a V.A. hospital -- it&#039;s a great example of how efficiently the government runs anything. <br /><br />My grandpa has asked me to shoot him with his Army issue hand gun before taking him to the VA Hospital -- All they do is misdiagnose and shell out medications supplied by Big Pharma contracts to soldiers struggling with injury and psychological issues who end up abusing alcohol, using drugs and then committing suicide. <br /><br />Check the current suicide rates for American Veterans.

But everyone has the share the roads and you can royally fuck up someones day by damaging their property or injuring their body. Having insurance to cover any costs that you&#039;ve inflicted upon another person is completely understandable and accepted.<br /><br />No one shares my body, therefor I don&#039;t see the need to have to pay for health insurance. It is a risk reward situation that is governed (well not anymore) by the individual. Should I choose not to insure myself and eat right, exercise, maintain a cautious lifestyle and make good decisions then I am hedging my bet that I would not need to enter a hospital and saving my money. You can no longer do that, you still pay whether you use it or not. <br /><br />My real beef is not with the actual Healthcare Reform -- it is the individual mandate that was deemed a Constitutional Tax and allowed to pass through with the Bill. The good part of the Bill is that, should you have the money and warrant to get insurance, you can no longer be denied by private sector companies for having previous health conditions.<br /><br />And how the fuck do they plan on paying for this universal health coverage?<br /><br />Print More Money (They are calling it digitizing now)<br />The growing money supply denominator will cause inflation; purchasing value of dollar decreases<br />Gas and food prices will go up to compensate the inflation whilst wages stay stagnant<br />Middle class will suffer even more and dip to lower classes and tax brackets<br />Less tax coming in means print (digitize) more money to continue governmental reach<br />Poverty conditions force families to subsidize financially where they can, majority of this will come from decreased quality of food<br />Growing children will be consuming chemically altered and processed food causing major health problems like obesity and its associated heart ailments<br />These young adults will need healthcare coverage <br /><br />Progressive society is progressive<br /><br /><br />

I think I will start with a free apple program. Everyone likes apples right? Okay, if you pay me $500 a month I will supply you with two free apples a month. It is win win, you get free apples and I get $500 !! The difference between my free apple program and the governments free programs is that the government has an army of armed thugs who force you to pay for all of your free shit, where as I can only hope you like free apples enough to pay $500 a month for them.

				It&#039;s hard for Europeans to understand the US right mindset when it comes to this sort of stuff<br /><br />For us, we just have our health care taken care of pretty much. and have done for a long while. It&#039;s been a part of the tax system and people just accept it. Therefore a lot of us think &quot;why the fuck wouldn&#039;t they want that shit taken care of? Losing your house when you have cancer? FUCK THAT&quot;<br /><br />But the US aint had shit like that EVER.. and a lot of them see it as nanny-state politics and an inevitable tax increase, which it arguably is<br /><br />

				I think Europeans are confused on how health insurance actually works(ed) in the US. For most, their health insurance is taken out of their check by their employer who most offer a variety of different programs with different premiums to fit the different needs of the employee. The employee doesn&#039;t pay the full premium, it&#039;s often vastly discounted to pay &lt;25%, although most small businesses opt for some GHP or similar program that is usually a 50/50 split on the costs of the insurance, employee/employer. So in essence it is &#039;taken care of&#039; in a manner just as easy as in many other countries.<br /><br />Then you have those whose employers do not offer health insurance, and they have to seek out their own health insurance where some may pay lofty premiums, for others it offers the advantage of shopping around for the cheapest, best network, whatever they value most.<br /><br />Many, usually younger &lt;30 year old singles and especially males, opt to not even pay for health insurance even if their employer offers it because they value the ~$100 per month more and they rarely make doctor visits anyways. The risk is if they are in some sort of accident or get cancer then they will probably lose assets and at the very least be relying on tax payer funded government programs to bail them out.<br /><br />And then we have those completely reliant on medical assistance programs paid for by our ever increasing taxes. While this program is meant to take care of say a single mother of 2 who works her ass off working 2 jobs, it&#039;s also abused by just as many people. My ex-girlfriends sister was a single mother who worked around 25 hours a week as a stripper, didn&#039;t report the majority of her income, and abused every government aid program out there including tax fraud by paying to report friends children as dependents on her taxes.<br /><br />SO it&#039;s not that your health insurance is superior in that it&#039;s &#039;taken care of&#039; for you, it&#039;s more that our health care system has the right to deny people for pre-existing conditions, cancer for example, that make it impossible for any health insurance company, who is a business trying to make money, to take them on and incur the millions of dollars of medical bills that will follow. And it&#039;s those that opt to not have insurance in the first place, and roll the dice, lose and end up costing tax payers.<br /><br />I can see both sides of the argument, and have been on both sides myself as I went uninsured for a large part of my life and luckily it didn&#039;t bite me in the ass.

If you followed the ruling, you would know that those that don&#039;t pick up insurance will face a tax, not criminal charges. Sure, if you don&#039;t pay the tax penalty you&#039;re subject to charges just like if you don&#039;t pay any of your other taxes. But to claim that not buying health insurance leads directly to criminal charges is false and misleading. Also, where are you coming up with this &quot;shelling out for Government Health Insurance&quot; myth? Are you aware that there is no public option in the ACA?&nbsp; Kind of hard to shell out for something that&#039;s not even offered. The law keeps health insurance the uninsured are obligated to purchase confined to private sector insurers, which kind of explodes your whole argument about government run healthcare that simply doesn&#039;t exist. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you tell someone living on the streets or supporting a family on a fixed income that they now have to pay for something they may or may not use. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Someone on the street with no income isn&#039;t affected dude. Since the penalty is in the form of a tax, they certainly aren&#039;t going to pay it based on an income they don&#039;t have. They&#039;re probably already on medicaid as it is.<br /><br />Fixed low income families with difficulty affording insurance will get tax credits that will make it affordable so they&#039;re better off with the law. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not to mention, if you&#039;ve ever served and tried getting anything processed through a V.A. hospital -- it&#039;s a great example of how efficiently the government runs anything. <br /><br />My grandpa has asked me to shoot him with his Army issue hand gun before taking him to the VA Hospital -- All they do is misdiagnose and shell out medications supplied by Big Pharma contracts to soldiers struggling with injury and psychological issues who end up abusing alcohol, using drugs and then committing suicide. <br /><br />Check the current suicide rates for American Veterans. The numbers are astonishing and still climbing.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Totally irrelevant dude. The ACA doesn&#039;t involve setting up a government run health insurance agency like the VA. Even if there was a public option, it wouldn&#039;t look anything like what your grandpa saw. It would be setup like medicare; a wildly popular and effective social entitlement program. But there&#039;s no public option, so it&#039;s useless to even go down that path.<br /><br />Maybe you&#039;re opposed to the ACA because you&#039;re ignorant to what the law actually entails. Based on the mis-characterizations of the law made in your post, you definitely seem to be the victim of some really badly sourced misinformation. Either that or you&#039;re intentionally perpetuating bullshit, but I prefer you have the benefit of the doubt.

				I remember that incident. He was dodging questions like Mitt Romney. There&#039;s literally no other way to describe it but hypocritical.

				The war on drugs has failed at keeping drugs off the streets, but it will continue because it make people rich. It doesn&#039;t matter how many gang members die in turf wars, how many people we imprison, how much propaganda gets shoved down out throats, or who did what whenever. The few politicians that have come out for legalization have shot their carers in the foot. No more big $$$ donors for them. <br /><br />The cartels make the money extorting product from the farmers. The middle men make money from being a mule (jack ass). The dealers make their skim selling to us. The law enforcement and judicial system makes money during arrest seizures and fines. The bankers make money laundering the money from everyone. Politicians get their donations from pharmaceutical companies that don&#039;t want people to smoke weed instead they have hundreds of addictive substances to take their place. <br /><br />So the more shit changes the more it stays the same

				Dock your income tax refund? Would that be the income tax that you voluntarily send off every quarter?<br />Of course it&#039;s voluntary, with no coercion involved. In fact, I invite you to NOT send any in for a few years. I&#039;m sure you will be fine.<br /><br />Sarcasm aside, the coercive nature of the state&#039;s revenue streams very much underpin the coercive nature of this bill if it&#039;s enforcement mechanism is but a mere alteration to an existing coercion.<br />But that&#039;s just statism for you, no surprise to those who see it. Just as the &quot;conservative&quot; jumping ship should come as any surprise to anyone who has seen through the false one dimensional political dichotomy.<br /><br /><br />Actually, Milton Friedman, that &quot;great champion of the free market&quot; helped pull the greatest con job ever on the American people when he oversaw the implementation of employer withholding.<br />Think about it, how many dupes do you know (sorry if your a dupe, learn history and Austrian economics) who actually look forward to tax day?<br />Because they have used the government&#039;s interest free withholding as a substitute for self discipline by upping their withholding, and see the day of accounting as payoff day, instead of ripoff day as it really is.<br />When people have to sit down, figure out the complex code, do the math and then write a check they see it for what it is, coerced theft of both thier direct labor in doing the return and the fruits of their labor in the payment.<br />Yep, that,s some free market economist that would help set that brainfuck up.

				Based on the first and last pages I skimmed over, ya&#039;ll aren&#039;t happy about ACA because it&#039;s ~forcing~ ya&#039;ll to buy health insurance. That&#039;s cool, whatever, and I do wish there was a way for people to opt out, but the reason for this is so that people can&#039;t refuse to get insurance and then when they get diagnosed with cancer, decide to buy insurance because of the elimination of &quot;pre-existing conditions.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;I for one am pretty fuckin&#039; overjoyed that the ACA was upheld. First off, it requires private insurance plans to allow dependents to stay on their parents&#039; insurance plans until they turn 26. It also completely eliminates the pre-existing conditions bullshit that insurance companies used to use in order to refuse to cover people with lifelong chronic conditions. It also bans companies from kicking sick people off their insurance and eliminates the annual and aggregate monetary limits that insurance companies placed on people. When I turned 21 and got kicked off my parents&#039; insurance, I was still a student and I worked at a job that offered the shittiest insurance and only to full-time workers who&#039;d been there for more than 9 months; they capped my hours at 35 hours a week so I couldn&#039;t get benefits. I&#039;ve been diabetic and partially deaf since I was 2 and 13, so I couldn&#039;t even buy private insurance because nobody would cover me unless I paid more money than I even made in a month. <br /><br />It&#039;s obviously got plenty of flaws, but for sick people, it&#039;s fucking fantastic. (And if you&#039;re one of those &quot;survival of the fittest, if sick people can&#039;t take care of themselves then they deserve to die out&quot;, here&#039;s a preemptive &quot;coolstorybro&quot;)

No one is forcing anyone to buy anything. The only people compelled to do anything at all are those who can afford insurance but choose not to purchase it, who are then taxed a relatively minor amount in accordance to their income. If you don&#039;t feel the federal government has the right to force you to pay taxes, then you&#039;ve got far bigger issues than protesting a relatively measly tax penalty enforced in the ACA. But giving you the benefit of the doubt, I bet you already knew that and are just being disingenuous.<br /><br />And just to be clear, imposition of a tax penalty based on a tiny percentage of actual income on those that can afford health insurance but refuse to buy it is not forcing them to do so and to claim that it is is just absurd, or reductio ad absurdum as they teach in logic 101.

Didn&#039;t mean to imply mental problems and regret it having come across that way. I&#039;m always receptive to changing my stance based on empirical evidence and the strength of ideas. To treat different or unconventional ideas with hostility is indefensible and any efforts I make to engage in spirited debate should never be confused with a personal attack. The issue I was trying to flesh out was those in opposition to the ACA&#039;s tax penalty from those who don&#039;t have a problem with taxation otherwise as IMO that represents the height of hypocrisy.

				It has one flaw, the same flaw that is at the root of taxation....it isn&#039;t voluntary. If it isn&#039;t voluntary then that only leaves coerced.<br /><br />Law means violence period. The only just law is law used for the purpose of allowing the individual to employ group assistance in securing his natural right to self defense of his property. His body is nothing but an item on the list of things that are his property mind you, perhaps the highest on the list most times but still just property. <br />All rights are property rights. Your human rights are rights to protect the property that is your human body.<br /><br />So any law that violates your right to have property and have it unmolested by others against your will is unjust law and therefore illegitimate.<br />It may be true that force wins when put to the test but it does not change the true nature of just and unjust law.<br /><br />Most would agree that it is unjust if a person came up to you and attacked you and took your property. Or commanded any action of your body that you didn&#039;t agree to.<br />Or prohibited any action you might take that could not be proved to violate the property of any other. The reason we are here.<br />Most would agree that if 10 people came up and did the same thing that you would have been assaulted, robbed or enslaved by a violent gang of criminals.<br /><br />How many people does it take for a right that an individual does not possess to suddenly appear out of a vacuum?<br />Does not nearly every democratic government on Earth claim that it&#039;s power come from the people?<br />How can it have any power no person ever had to transfer to it?<br /><br />Government is violence. It makes it&#039;s living parasitically from the efforts of others. In democracy it expands as far as it can.It will crash eventually, it has to by it&#039;s very nature.<br />It hinders the creation of wealth hugely while hypocritically claiming to be preserving it. It does so by taking from creators and giving to consumers. These are the promises that must be to gain consent to be ruled and the root of the expansion and inevitable collapse.<br />The numbers don&#039;t lie, your grandparents had far greater purchasing power and savings than you do...on average or even far above average.<br /><br />In days of Kings at least there was an honesty in this and the King may have even taken care of the kingdom the way a farmer wouldn&#039;t rape his crops. Or when not the blame was clear.<br />Now we have revolving door dictatorships where the incentive has been created to rape and pillage as much as they can while they can because their time is short. This from the guys on the stage at least, the crew backstage is really directing the show and maintaining it so that the show can go on.<br /><br />They did not create society, it spontaneously generated out of the benefits of working together. They don&#039;t maintain it either, other than the part of it which is their own racket, they feed on it until it crashes and then point fingers at the one constant in the human equation, the only thing that never changed.....greed.<br />Greed doesn&#039;t vary, only the collected power to express it does and the variance of that power can be indexed to the rise and fall of prosperity over time. Greed can&#039;t be indexed to anything because it is a constant distributed amongst the populace.<br />Self interest is hard wired into all life born into the realities of scarcity and the concurrent need to consume or die. Even the suicidal act in self interest, often thought the most self centered act possible.<br /><br />The smallest amount of research with these facts in mind will tell vast stories as long as you ignore the official propaganda and draw your own conclusions. You have to be self honest first, especially if you gain from the plunder of the State. I do, but self honesty more important, the truth is more important.<br /><br />But greed is the scapegoat, just law is but another victim and individual liberty is plowed aside to allow for more centralization of power, more EXPRESSION of greed to be made possible while drawing the worst of the worst towards it. Greed seeks power and if power exists in a nice package greed will control it. Just law be dammed.<br /><br />And the proles cheer the whole thing on because they won&#039;t admit their own jealousy. They enable the whole thing by laying down their liberty for the promise of another man&#039;s sweat so they don&#039;t have to try so hard themselves, or admit failure.<br /><br />

Plus, you are providing apples consistently, however for health care, you may only need to get a check up once every few months. Plus, the cost of Health Care will vary depending on what needs to be addressed. Also, how can you insure someone for Apples? You do realise that your&nbsp; Please don&#039;t be christian with your way of thinking. :)<br /><br />The problem with Obamacare in the US is that it shouldn&#039;t be an insurance to begin with. It should be nothing more than a Public Health Care SYSTEM. Private Health Care may include Insurance, but actually insuring it will cost a lot of money. For example: We spent trillions of US Dollars on Swine Flu globally. Now imagine insuring that, and providing for all the people that fell sick to it.<br /><br />If it is only a Public Health Care System the costs will go down substantially. Australian &quot;Medicare&quot; (Our public health system) incures a tax levy of 1.5%. If you&#039;re earning around 200k p.a., your Medicare Levy increases by 1.0% to 2.5%. The Medicare Levy provides: Free Checkups at all registered clinics (there could be a clinic only for people with Private Health Insurance), Free Public Hospital (but then they pick the doctor). Of course, you can opt not to get Medicare, but once you have it, you can&#039;t really get rid of it because you&#039;re in that system forever lol<br /><br />edited because i gave wrong information somewhere here :)<br /><br />&nbsp; :-\ TLDR: america is still doing it wrong.

				I don&#039;t understand - in Australia, all citizens are entitled to go to a hospital and have any treatment that they require for absolutely nothing. That&#039;s how it should be. All people should have the right to be healthy regardless of how much money they have. Is that not a basic right? If there are people forgoing medical treatment and living in misery because they have to chose between rent and a life saving operation, is something in the system not fucked?

I don&#039;t see you acknowledging that there are benefits to participating in society that need to be paid for somehow. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">now this last part is just me being a pedantic asshole :P but the &quot;social contract&quot; isn&#039;t even a contract at all. at no time is anybody ever told the conditions of the &quot;social contract&quot; to which they must agree, at no time are individuals ever asked to agree to this alleged contract. the alleged &quot;social contract&quot; is nothing more than a blank check drawn on the life, liberty and property of the population that those in power can cash in at any amount that suits them, at any time, again and again<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s because it&#039;s implied. You participate in a society and enjoy its benefits, you&#039;re going to be taxed to pay for those benefits. If you walk into a restaurant and eat its food, bail on the tab, then claim when men with guns show up to arrest you for a dine and dash that at no point was it explained to you what the prices were for the food you ordered and at no point did you sign an explicit contract agreeing to payment for food ... well your stance is not going to garner much sympathy. <br />

That&#039;s the only benefit of government you can think of from living in a stable society? I&#039;m sure you&#039;re more capable than that. As a thought experiment, try brainstorming what other public service benefits you enjoy even if not directly. For instance, I&#039;ll point out that if the healthcare bill does in fact lower costs as intended while making insurance companies unable to deny for preexisting conditions you will get residual benefit from it.&nbsp; As a thought experiment, try and figure out why.<br /><br /><br />
