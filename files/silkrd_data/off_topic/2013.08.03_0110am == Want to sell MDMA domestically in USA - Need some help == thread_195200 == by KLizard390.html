				I am interested in selling MDMA domestically in the USA through Silk Road but I have a whole slew of questions that I need answered first...Hopefully you guys can help me out!<br /><br />-Can drug sniffing dogs smell MDMA? My guess is no but just wanted to make sure.<br /><br />-What retail stores sell baggies? I&#039;d rather avoid purchasing these online as I&#039;m trying to take every precaution possible.<br /><br />-Should the return address I&#039;d be using for my packages be made up or does it have to be an actual address? If it must be real, don&#039;t I risk getting that person in trouble? How should I go about choosing this address?<br /><br />-If I am dropping my packages off in USPS drop boxes, does it look suspicious if there are multiple packages from the same address being sent out on a consistent basis? Am I better off doing this or just going inside and paying with cash?<br /><br />-Is writing the address really more suspicious than using a printed address label? Don&#039;t most packages have written addresses? <br /><br />-How do I cash out my bitcoins without raising any red flags? Once my volume increases, I don&#039;t see how the profits I&#039;d be making wouldn&#039;t raise any suspicions. <br /><br />That&#039;s all I need to know for now. If you can answer any of these questions for me, I would greatly appreciate the assistance! <br /><br /><br /><br />

				-Dogs can smell MDMA (you can use MBB&#039;s-special bags)<br /><br />-buy bags at local headshops or gas stations with cash (not credit/check etc.) make sure u look old enough to not get ID&#039;d so they dont see your name(although this is not a big deal but you seem to be really concerned about security)<br /><br />-Return address should obviously be not linked to you in anyway. Probably best if its fake. Although many reputable vendors use same time after time.<br /><br />-I&#039;d recommend printing labels because this ensures that the delivery wont be screwed up as a result of unreadable handwriting.<br /><br />-Many methods of cashing out BTC just spend some time on the forums.<br /><br />As with all your questions, just read the forums and vendors guide(s) don&#039;t jump in before you know you&#039;re ready.

What exactly are &quot;MBB&#039;s special bags?&quot; I did a forum search on that and nothing came up except for your post. Other than that, you seem to have answered sufficiently enough all of my questions. I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research and these were some things I didn&#039;t come across exact answers to. The rest I should be able to manage on my own now that I know these things. Thank you once again&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Edit: Searched the forums on how to cash out BTC and I wasn&#039;t able to find anything :[

				MBB stands for Moisture Blocking Bag, they are bags that do not &#039;sweat&#039; meaning that odor will not leak out if properly sealed even in hot environments. <br /><br />Here is a sample vendor on SR selling MBB&#039;s, (disclaimer: I am not associated with and do not know the vendor)<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5494abdfb1

				Yeah, I was just about to say you can buy MBB&#039;s on SR. I suggest you don&#039;t do it with an account linked to your vendor account if you decide to go through with it. <br /><br />I think some vendors will find legit businesses in their area and use them for the return address. If they have a logo or something on their envelopes, try to get one on yours too. <br /><br />I also heard of vendors finding every drop box in their location and using them all at random times and in a random order.<br /><br />Fuck, I just read a thread on cashing out BTC safely the other day. The person said something about starting a legit business just to launder the money but you&#039;d have to have high volume for that. He also mentioned getting a job wear you make tips so you can just pretend you make a lot more tips than you do. Maybe you should consider selling the BTC you make. You could sell it on SR or localbitcoins.com (or some other similar service). Everyone can always use more legit BTC sellers. <br /><br />I just thought of the selling BTC idea. You&#039;re welcome.

I&#039;m confused as to why you think selling BTC is an original idea? lol.
