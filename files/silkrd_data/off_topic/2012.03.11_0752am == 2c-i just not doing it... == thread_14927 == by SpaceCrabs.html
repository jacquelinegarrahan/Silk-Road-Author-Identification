				this is my first time doing any drug besides weed and i ain&#039;t seeing much.... i got about 120 mg from kwiktrip and divided that shit by five and drank it with a cup of water, it wasn&#039;t bitter. after a while i took a bit and snorted it, didn&#039;t hurt as much as people said it would. No visuals, just slight shifting in objects and it&#039;s really really hard to focus on things, nothing spectacular though. it&#039;s already been like 5 hours, and shit has been going on. <br /><br />Im really dissappointed is this all? just slight disorientation and shifting objects? should i just down the rest of the shit next time?

				the thing about most of the 2cs is the clearheadedness which can make some people believe they are not tripping or the trip isn&#039;t as strong. learn the language of your drug before dismissing it.<br /><br />a few more experiments, maybe change your setting and ask yourself questions, perhaps write or draw to figure out more about how the drug is interacting with your body. You should generally feel a body high, not unlike MDMA with perhaps a slight uncomfortable feeling as you come up in waves. The visual trip itself can be minimal unless you allow yourself to lose focus and see what the drug has to offer through its language. as you begin to communicate in the language of the drug, you&#039;ll be able to learn to focus your/its energies to get the most out of your trip.<br /><br />good luck, the 2cs are a great family if treated with respect and understanding.

				I think i know what you mean jollygiant.<br /><br />When lost focus i would see things twisting and shifting and my thought process was definitely different, I realize this while listening to Dick Dale. While listening to the song &quot;esperanza&quot; it seems to be about a feisty spanish wave, and it would be wild but also calm down at times. lol whatever.<br /><br />Anyways it was mostly like, you got visuals but it kinda like when you&#039;re not high and when you try to pay attention to those visuals the vanish, kinda annyoying.<br /><br />So yeah maybe i should try my creative things, such a drawing or writing next time, or maybe a party would be nice, strobe and colors<br /><br />So took anywhere from 25-30 since it was just a estimate and a snort, do you guys suggest taking like 60mg? or maybe like or maybe like the rest of the pack which would be anywhere from 90-100mg. what dose should i try next

				Don&#039;t rely on eyeballing RCs. It&#039;s inconsistent for research and can be dangerous (you have some leeway with 2c-i).<br /><br />At higher doses, 2c-i can become a bit uncomfortable, there is an obvious speediness and perhaps muscle tightness.&nbsp; I found this to begin at 20mg or higher on 95%+ quality but YMMV.&nbsp; Smoking some weed helps potentiate results just remember to keep your head straight if you do, weed can make you feel dumber or more confused.<br /><br />it&#039;s a subtle trip that creeps up slowly, around 4-5 hours to peak at 15-20mg doses. Finding some nice art to look at or even just textures like asphalt or a carpet, could help direct some of that energy.<br /><br />2c-i feels like an old friend giving you a hug. Let go, embrace, feel its energy, then share yours, see how it changes as your mind becomes more centered. I&#039;ve heard it referred to as an &quot;ego reshaping&quot;, I can agree with this term. It can also be a helpful empathogen.

				From Alexander Shulgin&#039;s book on 2C-i:<br /><br />(with 20 mg) I think there is slightly less than full immersion in the sensual, with this material, compared with 2C-B, but I suspect it&#039;s more a matter of getting used to the language of 2C-I and the feelings--getting tuned to a slightly different frequency, really-- rather than that the material is less sensual or less easy to use sensually. Just different frequency, and we are very, very used to 2C-B. Good on the body. Transition, for me, not as strongly dark as 2C-B. But it could certainly take a lot more exploring, if we were able to give the time (about 9 hours) to it. Next day: sleep excellent. Energy next day unusually good. Quite tired by evening. <br /><br />

				Apologies for the bumping, but I have a few concerns.&nbsp; I also ordered 100mg of 2C-I from kwiktrip, and it should be here any day now.&nbsp; While doing more research on the compound, I read a lot of anecdotal reports of HPPD, and also saw a few sites claiming this is one of the hallucinogens most likely to cause such symptoms.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never taken psychedelics before, and I&#039;m kind of apprehensive now.&nbsp; Additionally, I read that smoking weed the next day can bring out residual effects.&nbsp; Any confirmation on this?&nbsp; If I want to avoid this, how long should I wait before toking again?&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone had any problems from 2C-I, particularly HPPD?&nbsp; Also, do you think 20mg is too much for a first-timer?&nbsp; I&#039;m used to overstimulation from MDMA and the occasional amphetamine, so that shouldn&#039;t be an issue.&nbsp; I know 15mg is the recommended starting point, but I want a fully immersive experience.&nbsp; Thoughts?

				20mg is good maybe a bit speedy, you may want to take it back to 15mg if you&#039;re worried. It can get uncomfortable with the speediness but it also has a soothing language to it.<br /><br />on, HPPD. yes. I&#039;ve experienced mild effects from this, especially when smoking ganja the few days after but I&#039;ve also taken 2c-i upwards of 10 times in the past 2 months and I&#039;m just dandy.<br /><br />sidenote: 2c-i + sex = awesome time (best when coming down)

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s HPPD if it goes away.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t worry about HPPD.<br /><br />I plugged 8mg of 2c-i about an hour ago.&nbsp; I&#039;m tripping a slight bit, but it&#039;s not what I imagined.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ll have to do more next time.

				...maybe you should just stay with weed...<br /><br />sorry, but i notice more and more people here with no drug/psychedelic experience.<br />why don&#039;t you people begin with the well known substances like LSD MDMA MDA.<br />If you think you&#039;re old enough for drugs, begin your experience with those &quot;old and good&quot; things.<br />I had sooo much of these &quot;old&quot; substances in the past 20+ years, and it needs some knowledge to go much further...<br /><br /><br />uups...tripping on 2c-b atm and not sure if you can follow my thoughts ;)<br /><br />Love &amp; Peace
