				My first transaction on SR today, $1000.<br />Nothing illegal particularly, just so very nervous I&#039;m about to lose a grand. <br />I did my homework and I&#039;ve lurked these forums for a long time.<br />Now the wait, and hope that I&#039;m as cautious as I like to think I am.<br /><br />I suppose most people feel like they&#039;re going to chew their nails off the first time?

				DON&#039;T FE mate, not on a grand - if they ask you to just tell them to cancel it. if it were me i would have started small, built some decent buyers stats then go for the big haul.<br /><br />i shat myself on my first purchase, but it was only a hundred quid, so if it came to it it weren&#039;t much of a loss<br /><br />welcome BTW :)

				I remember my first order from SR. I had been a member of SR for 6 months or so already doing endless research and calculating risks.. Just for a gram of Ivory&#039;s MDMA lol, I shit myself for a couple days waiting for it to arrive, but when it did it was the most satisfying feeling, there really isnt a feeling quite like it! haha. <br />But as you say you ordered something that wasn&#039;t illegal, it should be fine getting to you. :) don&#039;t FE ether!

				Yeah, why spend that much without testing the waters first? Run a few gramns of weed through and make sure your local post office is dumb as the rest.<br /><br />My first time was totally nerve racking. I use a PO Box, and I kept circling the PO looking for squad cars lol. Of course nothing happened. I picked up my box, went home, and got high as fuck.<br /><br />The other scary time was when a box was too big for my PO box so I got the little slip to take to the customer service desk for pickup. Of course that is no big deal, but again very nerous the first time it happened.<br /><br />The 60 year old PO worker went and got my box, and before handing to me, he tapped the box&#039;s return address and said, &quot;You ever been there?&quot;<br />I must have lost all my color and prepared for the worst.&quot;Uh, no.&quot;<br />&quot;Too bad,&quot; he said, &quot;must be a lot warmer there than it is here.&quot;<br />Old coot was just making smalltalk and about gave me a heartattack in the process.

				Why did I spend $1000?<br /><br />I won&#039;t say my logic is rational or wise in any shape or form, but it&#039;s just my nature to dive into something head first. There&#039;s only so many months of reading you can do before you say, &quot;fuck it, I&#039;m going to do it.&quot; <br /><br />I figure, if all goes well, very awesome *turns into a giddy high school girl*<br />If not, I&#039;ve lost money, sucks, but I keep money in the bank and I will take it as a lesson learned the hard way
