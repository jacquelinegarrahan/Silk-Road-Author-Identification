				So this dude went into stealth mode the day after I ordered some stuff from him and just pretty much said sorry yet its been almost a week and a half and haven&#039;t seen my product or had a response from him. How would I go about getting my money back off this whole thing?? He just went stealth and boom...was gone. And his rep keeps going down every time I see his account. Soooo what should I do here? I&#039;d really just like my money back. My product should have arrived a long time ago considering we are in the same country

				I ordered 16 xanies and the reolution is about to expire. He responded to my pm&#039;s at first. We remained friendly, but then he stopped reading/responding to my messages. I ordered May 3rd, and then he went all paranoid/scammer on May 4th. He told me most orders would be cancelled. I&#039;m sure he cancelled the smaller ones and is hoping SR lets him steal money from those of us who placed bigger orders.

				He got me for a little bit too...&nbsp; he&#039;s been logging on almost daily since the 4th.&nbsp; He keeps reading messages I send via a service that send a receipt when they are read.&nbsp; &nbsp;He&#039;s either completely cracked or got popped.&nbsp; No reason for a pure scammer to keep logging into a low feedback account.
