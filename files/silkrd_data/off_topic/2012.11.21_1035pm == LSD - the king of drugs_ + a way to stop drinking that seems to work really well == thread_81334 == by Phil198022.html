				Just a little background on myself. I used to drink a lot for several years until recently, also dabbled into other recreational drugs, mostly of the speedy variety. This summer I took LSD the first time and basically I feel like a changed man in many ways, like a switch was flipped. I don&#039;t even feel any urge to drink anymore, haven&#039;t been drunk in 2 months now (the longest stretch I can remember since about 9 years), and different from earlier attempts to quit drinking I don&#039;t feel any compulsion to start again, no cravings. Like in between I&#039;ve had some beer several times, but never with the compulsion to get hammered I had before. It&#039;s nearly like I&#039;ve left this really difficult to battle addiction with alcohol behind me in the matter of a few months.<br /><br />In addition I have discovered a new found love for classical music, I have found a new way of talking to my wife, so I really try to see things from her perspective and our relationship has improved as well. So I bow my head to Albert Hofmann and his great creation. LSD lets you contemplate life, enjoy art and appreciate a new found beauty in life that I had forgotten in many ways. In addition I don&#039;t suffer from hangovers and reduced mental and physical capabilities in the days following a trip like with other drugs or alcohol. So in my estimation this appears to truly be the king of mind altering substances, next to which the other drugs I have experienced just appear trivial, nasty and damaging to the health all at the same time.<br /><br />My love for this substance is here to stay and alcohol for me is reduced to an occasional social drink the way it should be.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if others here have had other such experiences?

				I agree that LSD is the king of psychedelics. I prefer even to ayahuasca and DMT.

				I agree. The most profound experiences I&#039;ve ever had were on LSD, there is just something special about it. I had a few breakthrough moments doing it as a teenager, which was probably the perfect time in my life to do it. At that age where you&#039;re just starting to think for yourself and question a lot of the deception around you. I don&#039;t think I would have figured out half the shit I know if it hadn&#039;t been for LSD, it&#039;s like a flashlight in a dark room.<br /><br />&nbsp;I did get a little burned out on it though, just did it too much in a 6 month period and lost interest for some years. I like to come back and re-visit every so often, bust it&#039;s been a good while right now.

				I need to stop drinking, but I think IÂ´ve pushed myself to it in a way. Too many broken mornings. People say subconsciously heavy drinkers drink to forget, that I would say is true. People take LSD to remember. I think I prefer to remember than to forget.
