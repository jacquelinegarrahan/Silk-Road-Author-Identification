				oh man this thread is making me lol<br /><br />I have positive karma? wtf lol<br /><br />The real reason I started this is because I really think the karma system added to the silk road forums is very very unnecessary. Not only do I think it is unnecessary, but I also think it is bad for the community.&nbsp; Do we really want to make people feel bad by giving them bad karma?&nbsp; What if the person really believes in karma.&nbsp; This could have quite the negative impact on person.<br /><br />I had -2 karma when I started this thread.&nbsp; So I thought, fuck it, might as well go all the way.<br /><br />And whats the story on moonbear?&nbsp; I hear about him a lot. <br />I belive I can beat moonbear!

				Why do people not like Moonbear? I see he has bad Karma and I saw his super-special-gay &quot;Please stop banning my account thread&quot; which was definitely more super-special and most definitely more gay than anything else I&#039;ve seen on here. What&#039;s he done wrong?<br /><br />@Moonbear I am sure you are not that super-special or that gay, it&#039;s just I haven&#039;t slept and I&#039;m a bit grouchy and I do like a bandwagon... :P
