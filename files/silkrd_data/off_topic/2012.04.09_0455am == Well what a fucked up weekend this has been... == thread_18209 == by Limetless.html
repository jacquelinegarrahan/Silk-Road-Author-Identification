				Ok so I went to visit a mate in London. Got here Saturday and went to a very tame house party where the only people other than myself and my mate was this guy wanted to argue with me and almost start a fight because he didn&#039;t like it that I said was better than what he had...and his fuckface mates. After he calmed the fuck down I sold a few grams to twat-faces chums who conceded the point. Then after this a drunk, kind of large girl fell on me and spilt wine over about 4 grams of Meph and 2g of coke I had on the table which resulted in a hour and a half long argument with her and her boyfriend to get them to give me the cash for it which they eventually did. I left about 30 seconds after this and me and my friend went back to his and got smashed, went sleep job&#039;s a good&#039;un. <br /><br />Woke up on Sunday, went to lunch BUT we didn&#039;t get to the cafe before being hassled by some junkies for money. Got to the cafe and face-palmed on chatting up a waitress and she denied me. Went back home, prepared to go out, started getting on it. Got to Ministry of Sound and got thrown out after 35 FUCKING MINUTES of being in there because we were caught taking MDMA...the security geezer was quite literally standing behind me in the crowd. On top of all of that, the MDMA was shit. <br /><br />It&#039;s now 5.30 am on Monday morning and having drowned my sorrows in Meph I thought I&#039;d share this tale of woe with the general public. I think it sets a new record in epic-failings. FML

They kept us in an office for 10 minutes trying to get us to say what it was. I managed to pass it off as caffeine, I think they believed me because it was really white (SR stuff, in my area nothing is so white except cocaine, but they tasted it to check if it numbed the tongue). Usually they beat people caught with drugs... we didn&#039;t get beaten and they didn&#039;t kick us out. Still, I was so fucking scared I couldn&#039;t even dance, and i lost over 1g of speed.

The shitter was the fact I had to argue the toss about crap with some wankers at a tame party and with the MD I dropped it when the bouncer had his torch in my face and I didn&#039;t realize LOL. <br /><br />However this slight altercation may just be the silver-lining.. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17872.msg183107#new
