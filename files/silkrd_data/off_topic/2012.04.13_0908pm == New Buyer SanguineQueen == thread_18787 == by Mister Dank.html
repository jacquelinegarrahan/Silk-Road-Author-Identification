				My experience selling on here has been filled with fake troll LE buyers, so from now on, I will sell to new buyers through the forum so everyone will know if they are trustworthy or not.<br /><br />Basically, since SR refuses to add buyer feedback, I will put it here. I let SanguineQueen know about this thread and he/she is aware and will post feedback about my product here as well. I&#039;m sending product without confirming the order and risking a gram of hash to see if this is a trustworthy buyer before giving them the ability to trash my score based on BS.

				Geez, just fucking go away dude.&nbsp; You&#039;re just a loser fear-monger who whines about LE.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe someone is actually buying something from you.

				So far seems like a good buyer. Messaged me that they received product and will be posting feedback on it shortly. :)

				Seller was cautious, but understandably so. After all, this is a business that could have serious consequences. Package arrived in a relatively timely fashion, about a week and a half from order to arrival, and included aforementioned negotiation about posting feedback here rather than straight to their profile. Packaging was spot on. Overall a positive experience and decent hash to boot.
