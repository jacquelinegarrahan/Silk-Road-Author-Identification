			<dd class="postbody">
				I want to die/kill myself. I&#039;m in pain each day I have chronic pain in my body and I want to finally be free from all financial obligations, family obligations and such.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always wanted to experience the afterlife and experience what is beyond this world I don&#039;t want to wait until I&#039;m old and in a home to die.<br /><br />But instead want to take my life early and when I say I pull the plug.<br /><br />I was thinking about poisons but that&#039;s against rules for asking. I&#039;m still seeking them out. I don&#039;t have access to weapons.<br /><br />The only other thing I&#039;d consider is jumping off a high story building but I don&#039;t live near any big places so I&#039;d have to travel and I&#039;m not entirely sure how I&#039;d go about gaining access to a place I could jump off.<br /><br />If you have any information, products etc to cause suicide that would be handy. I&#039;m after a painless death and I&#039;m 100% serious about this.

				I&#039;ll kill you. :) How would you prefer? If I were you I&#039;d buy an overdose of heroin from me - doesn&#039;t get any more painless than that. <br />Or I can shoot you with my bow, but I&#039;d be inclined to rape your rotting body and teabag you. <br />Wanna go out a fun way, buy a gun and assasinate a member of congress then shoot yourself, atleast then your dying for a cause.

				Thanks for the tips so far and the PMs but I dont want to move locations I dont have 5-9 grand spare to go overseas to die.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for something that I can order on here or black market reloaded which can end my life.<br /><br />Heroin. Needles skeeve me out man but I heard that ODing from heroin is painful. Also how much would you need to kill yourself? I&#039;ve never done the drug in my life I&#039;d be worried that I&#039;d do it wrong and I&#039;d become addicted to the stuff.<br /><br />If anyone has information on Poisons swallowed orally that would be a help.

				If you really wanted to kill yourself, you would find a way to do it. You wouldn&#039;t fuck around for weeks on an online forum.<br /><br /><br />But you don&#039;t want to leave your house to kill yourself? Stoop kid is afraid to leave the stoop?<br /><br />Just play WoW for weeks on end without stopping and end up dying like some of those dudes on the news.

Dunno where you heard it&#039;s painful. You pass out and never wake up. Easy, cheap, efficient, clean (ok you&#039;re not tolerant so you might spew everywhere while unconscious until your brain shuts down but that&#039;s just a total guess, not sure how ultra high dose/low tolerance works - only ever been around tolerant user OD&#039;s).<br /><br />nuff said. <br /><br />- nh

				My friend didn&#039;t look to be in much pain when he OD&#039;d. Just laying there sleeping peacefully and turning blue. His mom gave him mouth to mouth so he survived. Make sure no one&#039;s is around to save you if you&#039;re serious. Do it when no one is home or do it outside somewhere like in the forest where no one will find you. Make sure to leave a note so your family knows what happened.<br /><br />Order a gram from Nucleo. That will be plenty even snorted. Snort the whole bag and be done with it. <br /><br />How are you afraid of needles yet not afraid to jump off a building? That makes no sense to me. I&#039;m kind of the opposite.

				Use heroin and a benzodiazepine. You don&#039;t have to shoot up, you can snort it. I&#039;ve been clinically dead due to taking heroin with phenazepam still in my system from some time before, fucking long half-life. It wasn&#039;t painful.

				Its funny you said you feared heroin addiction; I would actually give some serious drug use a look. Not to kill yourself, but just do a bunch of drugs for a while. Good way to bury some of that internal pain and not have it be permanent. Then in a few years, who knows... you might find something worth living for.
