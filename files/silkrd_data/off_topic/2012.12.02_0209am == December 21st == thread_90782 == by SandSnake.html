				I&#039;m guessing most of you know about the Mayan calendar &#039;ending&#039; on December 21st. Just curious if anyone has any cool plans to celebrate. Obviously, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the apocalypse, but I do feel (hope) we are moving toward a paradigm shift in consciousness...<br />I will probably be up in the mountains with some close friends and a healthy supply of LSD and DMT to usher in the new era!<br />

				Hopefully a decent dose of Lucy and weed/hash. If I can get some DMT I would add that to the list also. Most likely not though. Can&#039;t seem find any domestic DMT and I don&#039;t feel comfortable ordering from the Czech Republic. Now I just need to find a good place to do this. Probably a nice hike up a small mountain or in the woods. Though it&#039;ll be cold. Haven&#039;t tripped in the cold before.

This unc is in good ahape and didn&#039;t piss away 30K on land unfit for a skinny scorpion. But yes to the bigger question: compiling enuf chemicals to see god or the aliens, who ever shows up first has my vote.

				*sigh* Do your research, this is all hype to sell shit, and to get people scared (which actually is what worries me). Mayans are actually filing a lawsuit over this farce about their calendar ending and the world ending. That is not what it means.<br /><br />However, December 21st IS an Occult holiday, called &quot;Yule&quot;. This is actually what people need to be paying attention to, not the freaking Mayan Calendar. I would definitely look for something of significance to happen (man made) around this date. For those of you that don&#039;t know, the powers that be throughout the world all follow the Occult. The Christian / Catholic claims are just a deception.

				the bible has been re-written and added things to it, but one thing i do beleive in the bible that god says something like,<br /><br />&quot;no man shall ever predict the end&quot;<br /><br />and there we go. it isnt the end of the world people, start of a new beginning or something crazy is going to happen, i really think alot of people are going to be so hyped up about the world actually REALLY ending that they will be doing alot of stupid shit and alot of things may go wrong the week before/day before/that day. we will see i guess ;)<br />
