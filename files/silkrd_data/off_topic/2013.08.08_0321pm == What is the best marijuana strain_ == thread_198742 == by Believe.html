				I have been smoking for about a year now, and just wanted to hear you guys out! Post your favorite(s) strains and let me know why! :p<br /><br />Some of my personal favorite thus far are:<br /><br />Purple Kush - I had some strong sativa highs, and I got pretty active while high<br />Blue Dream - Man, a lot of people told me this is the shit... When I smoked it, I understood why lol it gave me a good mix of body high &amp; head high, and it felt like a really nice mix of the two.<br />Bubba Kush - Strong body high.. Perfect for night time :)

				I&#039;ve been smoking weed for 18+ years, and I would say that my tolerance at this moment in time is pretty absurd.&nbsp; I can easily smoke 7-10 grams of tippy top end flowers in a day, and not get smashed, nor burnt out.&nbsp; Usually to get a &#039;good strong high&#039;, I need monster dabs of the best wax or shatter I can find.&nbsp; It&#039;s honestly disgusting how much pot I smoke.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, that being stated; my top 3 are:<br /><br />Silver Pearl ( Northern Lights#5 x Skunk#1 x Early Pearl)<br />Alpha Kush ( Alpha Diesel x Dr. Candyman OG)<br />*Master Kush ( Hindu Kush x Skunk#1 x Hindu Kush - preferred genetics)<br /><br />Silver Pearl and Master both have incredibly loud, musky, pungent smells and flavors, with astounding highs.&nbsp; Alpha Kush is simply the most beautiful thing ever, and definitely one for Sour, OG, and Headband fans. <br /><br />

				Honestly one of the best strains I&#039;ve gotten from the road is farmer1&#039;s Skush.&nbsp; Quality high all the way.<br /><br />Also the GSC I got from NCK was great but it was definitely an outdoor and I&#039;d like to try an indoor version of it to compare.<br /><br />Other than that I&#039;ve tried Blue Dream and liked it I wasn&#039;t insane about it or anything but it was good.

				Ok, this is easy.<br /><br /><br />The best strain boils down to two options, in the sense that they are the two most wildly popular strains out there.&nbsp; <br />True OG Kush completely locked the whole nation for a long time, from rappers (wiz khalifa has a batch specially grown for him, so did snoop dogg for the longest time) to dispensaries, even today some of the highest prices are for a top notch version of OG Kush.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vendor OGBryan offers a good version of OG but not the best I&#039;ve ever smoked.&nbsp; I have not bought OG from another vendor<br /><br />Sour Diesel is my vote for best strain, uplifting (not tiring) high with little to no comedown and one of the richest tastes I&#039;ve ever had in weed.&nbsp; Vendor 4me2know occasionally offers it and he has a very good product, again not the best version I&#039;ve had but it was excellent.<br /><br /><br />As far as any other strain: I had a great experience with some Afghan Gooey at a festival a couple of years ago, it was some of the strongest I had ever smoked at the time.&nbsp; There was also a batch of Romulan at that same festival that had a wonderful cure and honeycomb structure and tasted EXACTLY like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.&nbsp; I would literally pay $100 for an 8th if someone could provide me with that exact bud again.<br /><br />Truthfully; however, what really makes a good weed only partially has to do with genetics, if the plants do not have ideal growing conditions, are not flushed properly, or are not allowed to cure at a slow rate and then stored properly, you will not receive a product that is quality in taste, aroma, or length and quality of buzz.<br />My Qualifications:&nbsp; I have grown and consumed 100&#039;s of different varieties of cannabis over the last 10+ years.&nbsp; I have been smoking dispensary grade dank since 2003, and before that was growing my own.&nbsp; I have smoked from blunts, joints, pipes, non-percolated bongs, percolated bongs, hash skillets, vaporizers, vape pens, and once when I was very young out of the side of a powerade bottle covered in tin foil.&nbsp; I know my dank.

				Great thread :-)<br /><br />Most popular does not usually equal Best, but, I think adding a Poll to this thread would be good, though long with choices.<br /><br />Another good question might be &quot;what strain makes the best quality oil/wax&quot;. I wonder if that answer would be the same?

I&#039;d guess there is no &quot;best&quot; bud or oil for everyone as people&#039;s tastes differ. That said, If the oil was 100% active ingredients (including flavoring, smoothing,...ingredients) so it was the most powerful/tasty/smooth/... oil that could be made from each strain, I&#039;d guess some strains would be better than others for this unless distilling any strain down to a particular ingredient or two would provide the best (and equally great) oil. I hope the best oils would be more than just a pure chemical (or 2 in a preferred ratio).
