				Some good recommendations coming in. I&#039;ll give a couple mine and some thoughts:<br /><br />Dark Tower series--rather good but I always get bitter at a long series. I think it could have been shorter and the ending is...well, Stephen King. Glad I read it but I hear he&#039;s going to redo the whole series (perhaps playing off the ending of the seventh--I haven&#039;t looked into it since i heard about this months ago) which gives me mixed feelings.<br /><br />Dante&#039;s Inferno was an amazing read. I didn&#039;t quite enjoy Purgatorio and Paradiso in the same way. They just didn&#039;t have the same...tragic beauty to it? It didn&#039;t capture me the way Inferno did.<br />On this same vein of books--it&#039;s hard not to recommend The Odyssey. It&#039;s quite the read but you can really see the genesis of a lot of story archetypes that exist today. <br /><br />My latest (non scholarly) read was Fevre Dream by George RR Martin -- A vampire book published in this generation that doesn&#039;t kill the history of the mythos while taking it in a whole new spin.<br /><br />Left-field recommendation: Elizabeth Kostova -- The Historian. A good read. I don&#039;t like to call favorite books because I&#039;m fickle but this is a nice story based off the original Stoker mythos of vampires. The writing could be a tad on the juvenile (I must have read it a decade or so ago) but I felt it a compelling tale at the time I read it. <br /><br />Hmmm...my mind&#039;s blank but if people keep generating interest in this thread I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll remember some other books.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Vurt by Jeff Noon<br />If you like drugs and sci fi then you have to read this book,&nbsp; :)<br />Plot - copied from wikipedia<br />Vurt tells the story of Scribble and his &quot;gang&quot;, the Stash Riders, as they search for his missing sister/lover Desdemona. The novel is set in an alternate version of Manchester, England, in which society has been shaped by Vurt, a hallucinogenic drug/shared alternate reality, accessed by sucking on colour-coded feathers. Through some (never explained) mechanism, the dreams, mythology, and imaginings of humanity have achieved objective reality in the Vurt and become &quot;real&quot;.<br /><br />Before the novel begins, Scribble and his sister-lover take a shared trip into a vurt called English Voodoo, but upon awakening Scribble finds his sister has been replaced by an amorphous blob that Mandy, a fellow Stash Rider, nicknames &quot;The Thing from Outer Space&quot;. From that point on, Scribble is on a mission to find another copy of the rare and contraband Curious Yellow feather (found within English Voodoo), so that he can exchange The Thing for Desdemona.<br /><br />:)

				I can&#039;t believe Terry Pratchett wasn&#039;t mentioned, funniest books i have ever read. <br />Also they don&#039;t use any swear words but it makes you think it does in really smart ways, which i like in books (no vulgar language, but possible allusions to it).

				Nah, you know those are swear words. <br />He had this character I&#039;ll copy paste the wikia article, the book its from is called &#039;The Truth&#039;:<br /><br />&quot;Mr Tulip (other names unknown) is, along with Mr Pin, a member of the New Firm, a duo of interloping criminals in the The Truth. He is something of a contradiction: a remorseless killer with refined soul of a true fine-art connoisseur. He is differentiated from a common criminal by his habit of removing works of art from houses before committing arson, the ability to distinguish between priceless works of art and common forgeries, and an encyclopaedic knowledge of hundreds of years of great artists, artisans and their works. He is the muscle of the New Firm, and though an instinctive killer, recognises Mr Pin&#039;s cognitive skills, and leaves the thinking to him. He also suffers a mild speech impediment, causing him to often insert &quot;—ing&quot; mid-sentence (the suffix of an action verb without the verb itself). This hints that Mr Tulip&#039;s parental figures have left a lasting impression on his psyche, as he is someone who WANTS to swear but has been taught not to. It is also likely a commentary on the use and censorship of the swear &quot;fucking&quot; in dialogue.<br /><br />One major problem with Mr Tulip is not that he has a drug habit as such, but that he WANTS to have a drug habit, and has a tendency to buy and consume anything sold in little brown bags. Unfortunately he also has the ability to unerringly buy from the one man selling oven cleaner or chalk dust amid an entire city of filled with purveyors of illicit narcotics, hallucinogens and stimulants. His primary skill in the New Firm is his apparently unlimited supply of anger, and that he has turned mindless violence into an art form.<br /><br />Mr Tulip&#039;s past is hinted at being dark and fearful, a place even Mr Tulip is afraid to remember, but one of the memories he does have of his youth is the belief that as long as you have a potato, you&#039;ll be okay when you die. There are some hints that his family suffered from famine and he overheard that if there are potatoes to eat, the situation is not hopeless. His belief in this is quite firm, as &quot;since they&#039;ve believed it for centuries, it must be right&quot;. He is killed by Mr Pin near the end of the novel and used for a life raft as molten lead flows around the pair. Unfortunately, Mr Pin also steals his potato shortly before killing him, but Mr Tulip manages to retain the memory of a potato in the afterlife and Death allows him to reincarnate as a woodworm: the only woodworm to think &#039;this is —ing good wood!&#039; &quot;<br /><br />But closer to the end of the book you realise that he isn&#039;t swearing rather curses in only one way, by saying &quot;-ing&quot;. (The dash is an actual silence, not a censored syllable.)<br /><br />Also there is an ongoing joke in the book series where some tyrant&#039;s of a bygone era were killed by being hung by the &quot;figgin&quot; its not mentioned where exactly the figgin is on the body but sounds like you certainly don&#039;t want to be hung by it.
