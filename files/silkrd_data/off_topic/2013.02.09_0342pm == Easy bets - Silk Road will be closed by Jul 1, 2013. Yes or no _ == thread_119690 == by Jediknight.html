				Place your bet at:&nbsp; <br />https://betsofbitco.in<br /><br />This and many other unique bets you can place.<br /><br />I know there is a lot of great gambling choices here on the road, but i found this site that is quite unique.&nbsp; I don&#039;t usually promote websites or anything for free and i post this for conversation sake.&nbsp; its an interest to anyone with bitcoin experience.&nbsp; if you check out this clear net site:&nbsp; https://betsofbitco.in<br /><br />It&#039;s a betting website that offers really obvious and easy bets and only takes bit coin.&nbsp; You can make up your own bets too, sports, politics, technology, whatever. It only takes bit coins and transferring in and out is easy and transparent.&nbsp; It&#039;s legit and works well.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a gambler, but I share this for people looking for a legit clear net site to spend bit coins or alibi to tell people what you do with your bit coins. <br /><br />&nbsp; I just made 20% profit by betting that the average bitcoin prices wouldn&#039;t fall below $14. /Coin this week.&nbsp; Duh, it&#039;s been over $20. For a while.&nbsp; &nbsp;This was just one example of a simple and obvious choice for the winner.&nbsp; &nbsp; The calculated odds are there to see too. <br /><br />Anyway, the bets are so easy.&nbsp; But Huge payouts for the hard ones if you like risk.<br />Heck, you could make reasonable profits daily by betting at this site and just betting on the really obvious winners without any risk.<br /><br />Personally I hate gambling, but after seeing the 20% coins added to my wallet for such an obvious bet, I&#039;m convinced its a worthy place to drop some spare bit coins.<br /><br />Here aren&#039;t many sites taking bitcoin on clear net, but this is another alibi for having bit coins hehe.&nbsp; Gambling on this legit clear net site.

				Looks good, I use btcsportsmatch.com ... It&#039;s awesome if you know sports decently well. The lines are awesome and the owner only takes 1% of bets! Cashing in/out is as easy as funding a wallet. I&#039;m up roughly 20btc over the last couple weeks betting on NHL games<br /><br />Does the site you mentioned automatically fund your account after a win? Or is it a manual add by the site operator?

				Ya, It&#039;s super easy cashing in and out just like using silk Road basically.<br /><br />There is a standing bet on there against silk road!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Silk Road will be closed by July 1, 2013.<br />YES. or&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; ?<br /><br />You can bet for or against this statement.&nbsp; Odds are tilted to saying no.&nbsp; But if it does, you could win like 800% or something huge.&nbsp; -&gt; so, if you take the safe choice and bet that Silk Road WON&#039;T CLOSE by July 1, 2013 you will win like 32% profit on your bet amount.&nbsp; &nbsp;Easy money and an obvious win.&nbsp; <br /><br />The site predicts That one day in the month of February Bitcoin&#039;s are going to drop by five dollars.&nbsp; Just one day.&nbsp; If it does, the payout is small, so they must know something there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Watch for that one day and buy up some coins.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				I often wonder what makes them choose particular dates and times.&nbsp; It&#039;s like they know something or how they calculate odds has a factor?<br /><br />Dunno a out the July 1 .&nbsp; The site picked it.<br /><br />It&#039;s still kinda fun to bet on the stability of Silk Road, or your faith in its security.&nbsp; <br />You can also bet on bitcoin trading prices and even the transaction time of transactions - all sorts of Wiered bets.
