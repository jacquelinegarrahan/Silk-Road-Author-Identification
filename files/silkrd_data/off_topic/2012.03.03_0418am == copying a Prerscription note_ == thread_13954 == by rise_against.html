				unless you can find some carbon paper, a really decent printer that wont fuck it up, and a high dpi version of the form then chances are you will be sent to jail for about 15 different things. <br /><br />just find a cool doctor ffs it isnt hard.

				yeah, the pharmacist will call the cops straight away, because not only are you ripping him or her off, but you are also risking their license. they will have no qualms about shopping you.

				well, you guys are no inspiration!&nbsp; spent the last couple hours photoshopping a legal script copy and i must say i did a pretty good job of removing the &quot;void&quot; logos in the background, recreated all the fonts, color hues, etc. and i can&#039;t even tell the difference between the original and the copy!&nbsp; &nbsp; oh well.

				I know it&#039;s tempting but you have to ask yourself if it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; I know every time I went with my prescriptions I was shitting bricks and I did a great job of forging my shrinks handwriting.&nbsp; I&#039;m still kinda paranoid like is it going to get back to him somehow.&nbsp; I think the positive for me is that he has literally hundreds of patients so that kind of eases my paranoia.&nbsp; <br />If it were me I wouldn&#039;t do it with a photoshopped script.&nbsp; But if you do let me know how it works out for you.&nbsp; You also need to think about what schedule the drug is that you plan on writing for.&nbsp; If it&#039;s an opiate I&#039;d def wouldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				You don&#039;t want to fuck with the federal government like that, it is very personal and easy to convict.&nbsp; But if you do, I wouldn&#039;t try to get anything about schedule 4.

				the only thing i have done was a nurse practitioner prescribed me 10 Vicodin, and I turned the 10 into a 40. It worked but I was nervous.&nbsp; Even if they would have called her she would have covered for me now that I look back on it&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />
