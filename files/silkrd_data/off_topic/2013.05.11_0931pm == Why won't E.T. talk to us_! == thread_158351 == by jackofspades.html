				We (humans) are fucking up real good down here on good &#039;ol Earth and if there are intelligent beings out there they could help us out!<br /><br />Maybe they even read these forums because they believe the people on here are the smartest humanity has to offer (a little arrogant of me to say but completely true IMO) <br /><br />I don&#039;t think they are so advanced as to have no interest in us at all (i.e. the ant theory which states that it is comparable to a human trying to contact an ant) <br /><br />Humans are pretty smart, not because of what we do/make but for example consciousness. That&#039;s pretty impressive and something very few species that have ever existed have. <br /><br />Who is more likely to contact whom first?

				ET does communicate with us.<br /><br />ET communicates with us through the mind. There&#039;s no need for interstellar space travel. Thought travels faster than the speed of light. Thought uses quantum nonlocality to travel vast distances. Just take seven grams of magic mushrooms. If you&#039;re lucky, you&#039;ll make contact with a being from another galaxy. This being told me that psilocybin is actually a neurotransmitter in the brains of some organism in another planet. That&#039;s how we can communicate with him. We see what he sees through morphic resonance. He showed me a lot of things about his world.
