				I have a few Paypal stealth accounts that have balances in them. They are 100% legit and 100% mine... The only issue is I can&#039;t cash out of them like regular people do (not going to get into that because of anonymity so please don&#039;t ask)<br /><br />How can I turn these balances into BTC? I do not need to be anonymous when doing this.<br /><br />Just throwing ideas off the wall - thanks

				If it were me, I would gladly take your money and get you coins but I&#039;d charge you above market rate, I&#039;d want the money up-front and I would want the money in the form of a PayPal gift so you couldn&#039;t recall the money. I&#039;m sure a lot of people would say the same so you can see that it would be a massive risk on your part.<br /><br />Another way would be to buy a pre-paid debit card that has online account management as well (they go for roughly £5 - £30) and just withdraw as you normally would with a debit card.<br /><br />For extra security you could purchase it in someone else&#039;s name and get it delivered to their address. There is no credit check and you will be guaranteed to get the card. I have not tried this method myself and PayPal are notoriously twitchy so hopefully someone else has a tried and tested method.<br /><br />

				I am in the U.S where all withdrawable debit cards have to be hooked with an SSN, name and all of that because of the patriot act. Because the coins are legit I wouldn&#039;t do that...<br /><br />Anyone else have anything?
