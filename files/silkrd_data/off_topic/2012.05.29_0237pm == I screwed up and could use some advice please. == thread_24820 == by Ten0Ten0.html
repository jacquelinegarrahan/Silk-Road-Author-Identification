				Not sure if this is the right area to post this. I&#039;ve been at this job for several years. Thinking I could make a few bucks quickly, I decided to steal a few bottles of benzodiazepines. A few days later, I&#039;m now fairly certain they have me on camera taking them, at least two bottles. They will find out on the first of the month when they do inventory. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s under grand larceny but I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />What are your opinions on what my actions should be? It&#039;s either between wait til they find out, then deny, deny, deny. Even if they show me the evidence to my face I will still deny. All physical evidence and drugs are gone already. I&#039;m clean except my blood and hair. They would just have video or pictures of me taking it off the shelf. That would be it.<br /><br />I was also thinking about quiting early, because I already have another job lined up. I&#039;m wondering what the ramifications would be if I did quit early, then a few days later they find out it was me. Call my house, police visit?<br /><br />I&#039;m certain they have to get feds involved but I wouldn&#039;t think they have enough evidence to prosecute me, based solely on cameras. I&#039;m wondering if they will try to go after me in court, as it wasn&#039;t a major theft. Also, I believe it won&#039;t look like I was taking them, on camera. But they will still know it was me.<br /><br />I&#039;m leaning towards quiting early, to avoid confrontation mostly. Then hoping they decide to leave it be as I&#039;m not with the company anymore, however unlikely that is. Opinions?

				Quitting early will only look suspicious. <br />What kind of job is it? Does it require you to grab bottles of the stuff from the shelves all the time? <br /><br />I think that if there is only footage of you taking some off the shelves and not of you putting it in your pocket/bag w/e there&#039;s not a whole lot wrong. <br /><br />And how large is the company? 2 bottles missing on an inventory ain&#039;t that big of a deal I guess, could have just counted wrong last time ;)

				If they have any decent amount then they probably wouldn&#039;t even notice until inventory was balanced. If you&#039;re that worried about it put them back.

				Yes, I grab bottles off the shelf everyday. It isn&#039;t a very large company, they will find out on Friday. I am almost certain they only have me on taking it off the shelf, not putting it in my pocket or anything. They will know for certain it was me but all they will have is the video. They won&#039;t have any evidence besides that. They&#039;re gone already so I can&#039;t put them back.<br /><br />Just looking for opinions on what anyone think will happen. If I just get fired, not prosecuted, I&#039;ll be happy.

				You really think that? I&#039;m sure they have to get feds involved. The product I took is not touched often, only a few bottles are there. They will go through past records and will know it wasn&#039;t ordered.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m edging into grand larceny. I&#039;m freaking out a bit here if you didn&#039;t notice. Dumb impulse thing. Smacking myself.

				I&#039;m not sure of pharmacy prices, but I&#039;d guess $400-$600. Depends if they nail me on the third bottle, different substance and I wasn&#039;t in full camera view.

				I think you might be being a bit overly paranoid OP. I wouldn&#039;t worry.

				It depends on the video. Is the camera mounted in such a way that the video shows exactly what kind of bottle you&#039;ve taken? If so, they MIGHT have something against you but I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve got anything on you as long as you deny everything. If they show you the video just say you don&#039;t remember what you were taking from the shelf (again, depends on the video - if the bottles are clearly visible, you might be fucked).

				Yes, I&#039;m sure they will know exactly. They will see me taking the bottles but might not be able to identify them from the video. But they will see the location I&#039;m taking it from and know the item. It is a small area for controlled substances. But I do go in there fairly often to grab stuff. I hope I am just being paranoid but either way I&#039;ll be stressing until they do inventory.

				That is what I&#039;ve decided to do. Stick around until they confront me and then deny everything. I know I&#039;ll be fired but I don&#039;t care at this point. Thanks for the help everyone. Still wondering how the federal involvement will go down though.

				Pretty sure they are. I&#039;m banking on that they won&#039;t spend the time and money to go after me for only 3 bottles.
