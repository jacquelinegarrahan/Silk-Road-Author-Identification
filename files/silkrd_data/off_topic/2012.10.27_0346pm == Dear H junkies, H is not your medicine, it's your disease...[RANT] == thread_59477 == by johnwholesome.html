				RANDOM RANT WARNING!<br /><br />So, I happen to have an H junkie in my extended family, whom constantly refers to her drug as her &quot;medicine&quot;, presumably because it takes the withdrawal pains away.<br /><br />I dunno why, but it&#039;s really becoming a pet peeve of mine. ITS NOT FUCKING MEDICINE. Its the drug that you&#039;re addicted to and the CAUSE, not the REMEDY of your pain.<br /><br />I have no issues with people consuming their drug of choice. But there are users, addicts, and then there are straight junkies. Where I am this &quot;medicine&quot; lingo is becoming more and more prevalent, and for some reason it rubs me really wrong.<br /><br />You&#039;re addicted to a highly addictive drug, fucking face it, stop talking with this dumbed-down baby language for junkies to make you feel better about it. That might be the first step to solving your issues.<br /><br />Yeeerch.<br /><br />RANT OVER<br /><br />Sorry, had to vent...

				I think some &quot;Junkies&quot; are lying as much to themselves, as they are to others, about the reality of their drug addiction. It&#039;s a perverse coping mechanism. So yes, I tend to agree with you. <br />Although, there are the chronic pain sufferers who do use illegally bought heroin as a medicine to manage their pain. They&#039;re fewer in number and less publicly recognized, but they&#039;re still part of the group of opiate addicts that fall on the wrong side of the law (known as Junkies to some).<br /><br />I find when people describe they&#039;re use of cannabis as medicinal to be rather tenuous. I do believe some medicinal cannabis users do get a genuine positive effect from their cannabis use, weather it&#039;s from it&#039;s generally relaxing effects, or if it&#039;s psychosomatic, or if it&#039;s actually treating the specific illness or ailment in a medically valid and useful way. But, I also believe there is a larger number of cannabis users who wrongly label their cannabis use as medicinal, when it would be more accurately described as recreational. They may genuinely believe they are treating a medical issue, however I do suspect their love of cannabis has more to do with it. If an alternative and more effective treatment was made available to them, in the form of pills for example, which contained no THC or any other things derived from cannabis, I&#039;d think they&#039;d&nbsp; stick with their preferred cannabis treatment. Some maybe searching for a form of validation for cannabis use by using the medicinal label.<br /><br />I just want to say again that I don&#039;t believe all medicinal cannabis users are like this, and even the one&#039;s who are may be doing it for all the right reasons. I have nothing against cannabis (although I no longer smoke it regularly) or the people who use it. It&#039;s a wonderful, powerful and very useful plant and the skill and passion that some growers have is to be admired. I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone, I&#039;m just offering my opinion on the subject. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

There is such a thing as over dosing without ending up in the hospital or dead. I overdose every time i can on pain pills lol but I have quite the tolerance and I limit it to 5 of the ten mg or three 30&#039;s at one time and those dosages are over doses.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Mentally depending on a substance, leaving yourself unable to solve your own mental dilemmas without it, usually for a while. Check! (Not to mention withdrawal effects)<br /><br />Physical Harm?

				what the fuck is this Caparino, did you lose your password?<br /><br />Anyway, heroin is no worse then Morphine or oxy 30&#039;s.&nbsp; Does Morphine fall under your definition for being a hard drug? Or is your definition of a hard drug only include street drugs? They use fucking heroin in all kinds of prescription drugs that are legal as hell with a script.<br /><br />Fucking soda pops are fucking addictive and cause harm to the body as well. So is salt and tobacco and a whole host of shit. So in reality you consider heroin a hard drug because when you shoot it or snort it then you get high a fuck. Tobacco and alcohol is much more addictive and yea it could be because they are legal and easier to use on a daily basis considering legality and cost.<br /><br />Now I would never give my consent to a statement that said it would be ok if everybody was shooting heroin, it isn&#039;t, but anything can be used overly excessive.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Heroin is not the disease but the short term solution to the disease of addiction.....<br /><br />If you look into the disease theory of addiction, and the solution (12 steps), you&#039;ll see what i mean.<br /><br />Even the DSM classifies drug addiction as a mental illness.

				Nah man, I never said only street drugs. In fact as you stated heroin IS legal as a script. Soda pops aren&#039;t fucking addictive, sugar and caffeine are; they&#039;re just widely accepted by society. But seriously you&#039;re saying alcohol is more addictive than heroin? Fuck man, you gotta check your facts; the average time period to get addicted to alcohol is 9 months. Also, tobacco isn&#039;t really that addictive; it&#039;s the chemicals that they put in cigarettes that make them as such; plus I&#039;ve found it&#039;s the anxiety ridding activity of fulfilling both oral and manual fixations that get you addicted to the activity of smoking cigarettes. <br /><br />But going back to my original argument, there&#039;s no fucking way anything you&#039;ve listed is nearly as addictive or self-harming as heroin.

				It&#039;s been very educational. Never had any H mailed to me. I might have to give it a go. I have never experienced physical withdrawals from anything I have ingested. I have had nightmares from quitting cigarettes but I guess that would be a mental withdrawal. During the month I have access to a few thirties and hydros and xanax. When they are gone then I&#039;m out till next time. I don&#039;t try to space these out and make them stretch to last because i do it for recreational use. I simply won&#039;t ingest a substance unless I am going to get high so if I end up with ten hydro tens then I may make them last for two whole days lol.<br /><br />To me it&#039;s no good to take one a day when I don&#039;t feel a fucking thing from it. And yes i know it&#039;s more dangerous to take 5 at a time but truthfully I like some of the harder drugs better. I never had MDMA until I found the road because it&#039;s not here and now I would prefer it over a lot of drugs even tho I have heard about it&#039;s dangers. <br /><br />I really don&#039;t see the dangers of smoking weed except for the dangers of getting arrested for a non violent&nbsp; BS criminal offense. Oh and let&#039;s not forget that it&#039;s a gateway to other drugs. The truth is that people are going to live how they want and they are the fucking gateway because they are the ones who chose to do it. Yea marijuana will cause you to have a more open mind.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see the evidence stating that marijuana causes cancer or brain damage or psychosis because I have read tons about it and any claims have been proven to be false

The problem with doctors is they know very little about a lot, and unless they are specialists in a particular area (such as addiction) they&#039;re advice is worth jack shit. That&#039;s why any good doctor should refer you to a specialist &#039;drug agency&#039; or someone in a specialist role before quickly reading a page of a book and making a diagnosis.<br /><br />I was a full on street Heroin addict for 15 years, luckily I found a solution....and was completely clean for 9 years, until I came across SR!! yeah I don&#039;t use H anymore (have once in 6 months) but I now have a benzo problem. But luckily in the time I was clean I achieved a lot and I am happy with what I have (would have only dreamt about it 10 years ago). <br /><br />I truly believe I have the &#039;disease&#039; of addiction - everything I do, I do to the extreme. <br /><br />When I work on my disease by working a 12 step program I&#039;m fine, the minute I let my guard down I seem to use.... absolutely powerless over drugs, without a solution. It runs in the family too, so it&#039;s possibly in my genes.

				So are you saying it&#039;s a bad thing? Well we are living life and doing things we enjoy. I don&#039;t think you are hurting anyone in the process. Not even yourself. <br /><br />Doctors don&#039;t know enough about the human brain and all it&#039;s abilities and I am not saying That I do but i know what i have experienced and how i feel. I do know that whatever the mind conceives and believes then it will achieve<br /><br />If you chose to believe something whole heartedly with lots of emotion then that will in fact become your reality. If you think your sick then you will be sick

In the UK it certainly isn&#039;t a religious program. <br /><br />The only reason the word god is mentioned in the steps was because it was written in the 30&#039;s by two religious alcoholics in the USA called Bill and Bob - it&#039;s proven to work so the wording has never been changed, and never will be. Although over the years the principle of the program hasn&#039;t changed - the religious element has.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Only in good old USA can being caught with marijuana get you sentenced to turning your life over to the (totally not Christian only!!) one single male God and chanting prayers for His Glory. Turning your life over to the (I swear not Christian!) single male God and singing his praises is totally the cure to marijuana addiction (which is defined as having used marijuana), that shit is like scientifically proven man.

				Being forced to go to AA or NA is pretty standard here if you get in trouble for anything even remotely related to drugs or alcohol.

				They are really sneaky fucks too. In some places in USA courts have ruled that you cannot be sentenced to NA or AA as they are christian religious organizations. But then they will try shit like oh well you are not sentenced to go to NA or AA but as terms of your probation you must go to AA or NA so if you go to AA or NA meetings you can serve your sentence outside of prison on probation but otherwise you serve it in prison, but no of course you are not SENTENCED to AA or NA. They have a million and one tricks. <br /><br />http://legallad.quickanddirtytips.com/does-mandatory-alcoholics-anonymous-violate-constitution.aspx<br /><br />talks a bit about how God Damn unconstitutional forced NA is (despite the fact that it is commonplace). <br /><br />here is another site that is for the people sentenced by the courts to become members of these christian religious cults <br /><br />http://leavingaa.com/?page_id=14<br /><br />but really AA and NA are not even the worst that you can be sentenced to. Some of the in patient rehabilitation facilities you can get sentenced to are pretty much combinations of fascist re-education centers and Jesus Camp. Authority is there to be obeyed not questioned! You are addicted to drugs for the rest of your life (ie: you have used drugs ever in your life) and your only cure it to turn your life over to Jesus Christ and continually put your faith in him! I shit you not. This is where the court will send you if you are lucky enough to avoid getting sentenced to prison and ass rape but unlucky enough to be sentenced to something worse than probation and AA/NA christian indoctrination.

				THE TWELVE STEPS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS<br />1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become<br />unmanageable.<br />2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to<br />sanity.<br />3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we<br />understood Him.<br />4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br />5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature<br />of our wrongs.<br />6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.<br />7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.<br />8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make<br />amends to them all.<br />9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do<br />so would injure them or others.<br />10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly<br />admitted it.<br />11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with<br />God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us<br />and the power to carry that out.<br />12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to<br />carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our<br />affairs.<br />Copyright  A.A.

				Seriously the worst part about USA is that they pretend to be something they are not. They should change the name to the United States of Jesus land and implement a judicial system that quotes the scripture because essentially that is what the country is. Know the real reason why you can&#039;t smoke weed or take LSD? Because it will piss the all mighty sky wizard off! They should change the official title of the vice police to the religious police and be done with it. I guess we should be grateful that we can dance in the street and not be beheaded.

				i highly recommend the book &#039;Globalization of Addiction&#039; by Bruce Alexander. gives some great evidence that addiction is not caused by chemicals, but is a &#039;coping method&#039; by people who are socially dislocated (i.e. people with &#039;empty lives&#039; so to speak).<br /><br />check out this video which explains the &#039;Rat Park&#039; experiments into addiction http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/cartoon-blog/australian-cartoonist-box/<br /><br />( By a cartoonist who is working with Alexander to do a follow-up to this beauty of a comic: &#039;War on Drugs&#039; http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comics_en/war-on-drugs/ )

				i think you are missing the element of black humor behind people calling their opiates &quot;medicine&quot;. i say from my own experiences being a junkie, and many times i would jokingly refer to my dope as my &quot;medicine&quot;, cause it would stop me from being sick. of course the sickness i&#039;m talking about is dopesickness, and it&#039;s not actually medicine. and i don&#039;t know about your specific case OP, just my two cents<br /><br />honestly nothing makes me madder than hearing stoners talking about getting their &quot;medicine&quot; and being &quot;medicated&quot; and people in dispensaries talking about how great their &quot;medicine&quot; is and all that. i have nothing against marijuana, i just hate the bullshit hypocrisy of the &quot;medical use&quot; provision in America. not to say there aren&#039;t legitimate medical for THC, it just irritates me to see perfectly healthy 25 year old guys talking about much better their life is since they got their &quot;medical&quot; use green card. there&#039;s nothing wrong with getting high, but i hate people that are full of shit!

				Ya know... in the defense of addicts, it can be awfully difficult to accept that you&#039;re an addict and that you just plain don&#039;t want to stop using.&nbsp; We&#039;re not the best parts of ourselves, we&#039;re the sum of all of our parts -- addictions included.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same kind of thing as being homosexual or any other personality trait that you get ostracized for.<br /><br />Let me qualify that: I&#039;m not saying homosexuality and drug addiction are both equally genetic, though I think a good argument could be made for that (I&#039;m not going to be the one making it though).&nbsp; Just that sizable portions of (US at least) society consider one or the other to be scum, criminals, or even genuinely evil.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s hard to face who you really are, let alone learn to accept yourself when others don&#039;t.<br /><br />Let &#039;em call it their medicine until they can look in the mirror and not lie about who they see.&nbsp; Same thing as saying a loved one &quot;passed&quot; (I really hate that one for some reason) instead of accurately saying that they&#039;re fuckin&#039; dead and rotting like we all will be one day.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t point out God.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t change what&#039;s going to happen to our bodies.<br /><br />Just ignore their euphemisms; in the end it&#039;s their problem, not yours.&nbsp; If they&#039;re making it yours, then walk away.&nbsp; If they die without ever really looking in the mirror... well... then they&#039;ll die a self deluded fool.&nbsp; Either way, you can&#039;t force somebody to see what they&#039;re unwilling to see.&nbsp; And even though it pisses me off too, their life belongs to them.&nbsp; I mean who are we to fuck with the rose-tinted glasses they decided they need?<br /><br /><br />By the way, I think some of us are misunderstanding the benefit of &quot;handing your life over to a higher power.&quot;&nbsp; It allows them to shed some of the guilt and self-loathing that comes with being something other people despise you for.&nbsp; Optimism and positivity are always more beneficial to your success than vicious self criticism.&nbsp; Let me stress that: ALWAYS.&nbsp; If you think you&#039;ll fail, then you&#039;re going to fail.&nbsp; If you think you&#039;re scum, you&#039;re going to either stay or become scum.&nbsp; Belief and expectation are amazingly powerful things.<br /><br />If you give yourself over to &quot;something higher,&quot; it allows you to forgive yourself.&nbsp; To bypass the expectations you have for your own actions.&nbsp; To see the possibility for something better tomorrow than you went through yesterday.&nbsp; Every addict has tried to stop and failed.&nbsp; They have evidence that they can&#039;t do it.&nbsp; So it&#039;s kind of necessary to let somebody else &quot;decide for you.&quot;&nbsp; If you ask me, that&#039;s the reason it seems to help a lot of people.<br /><br />... on a personal note, I think it&#039;s complete bullshit and AA/rehab make me want to gouge my eyes out.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really mind being an atheistic junkie though, and if it helps some people, then I&#039;m happy they&#039;re happier :)

Both forms can overlap or be exclusively independent for each other, and each form can vary in strength. For example, the gambling addict that is hopelessly addicted to gambling, and has lost almost all self control. That is an entirely mental addiction that&#039;s no less potent than the physical addiction of a heroin addict. Smoking is a combination of both forms of addiction. Cigarettes have mild physical symptoms and are also very mentally addictive and habit forming, some would say there as hard to give up as heroin, if not harder. And finally, heroin has severe physical withdrawal symptoms, but many users find that once they&#039;ve overcome the physical addiction, the real battle then begins with the mental addiction, which can lead to extreme depression, insomnia and lethargy for months if not years.<br /><br />My point is, there are many forms of addiction. Each with different elements or contributing factors. No form is better or worse by default, and each form can vary in magnitude depending on the circumstances. So to say substance A is more addictive than substance B, is greatly oversimplifying things.
