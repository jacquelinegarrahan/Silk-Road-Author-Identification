				Coke. Nothing else is worth doing the damage to your sinuses. Although I do sniff other things on occasions. Not my favorite ROA but up there.

				Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve really enjoyed anything I&#039;ve snorted. Benzos(ativan, xanax, phenazepam, etizolam) and a few different opiates, and some speed is all I&#039;ve tried though. Should maybe try some coke soon.

I&#039;m not sure if this is true, but i&#039;ve notice they hit harder if i place one under my tounge then snorting them. <br /><br />Favorite drug to snort is a tie between coke, (I love the drip.) meth (I love the pain and how it makes my nose feel cold.) and pain pills. (I&#039;ve snorted so many pain pills that my brain just get&#039;s fuzzy as soon as it comes up the straw.)

				There is only ONE!!<br /><br />It is cocaine!<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried all the usual drugs and now am drug free for most days of the week,<br /><br />I can go out and enjoy beer, but I do like to use cocaine as a social drug.<br /><br />I have a little bullet grinder and simply use when I feel like.<br /><br />Trouble is finding the GOOD coke to put in there. Got burnt here after having a kind off good thing until the FE rip off. So shut that account as my stats got fucked with coke scams.<br /><br />Anyhow, a mirror is better, a couple of fat lines, and I like that!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So whgo has the BEST send to me!!!<br /><br />uktoker

				Back in the day, when we used to go to the local pub practically every night, coke was a BIG thing.<br />It was nice at the time, but after that when supplies would eventually dry up at times, we tried snorting speed.<br />Your nose pisses like a tap for five minutes after your first line, but after that mate you can seriously talk for your country.&nbsp; I would honestly put it up there with coke, and the plus side is that if you do a bit too much you dont get eyes like fucking golf balls, like you can with coke.<br />Also, from what i remember, speed was like 15 quid a gram, where as coke was 35 or 40 quid a gram, depending on the dealer.
