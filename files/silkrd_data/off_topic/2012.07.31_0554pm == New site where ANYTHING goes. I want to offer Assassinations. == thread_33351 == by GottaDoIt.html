				Hello<br /><br />Could DPR create another site where anything goes? For those against this, it would actually take heat away from SilkRoad if there&#039;s another worse site selling worse things and offering worse services.&nbsp; Hell, I could run the site and give all the profits to DPR. <br /><br />Or maybe just allow these sort of things in the Armory?<br /><br />I just think, if you want to offer REAL freedom, there should be a site where anything goes. You know the saying &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; I think that applies here.<br /><br />So, what do &#039;ya say?

DPR and SR staff are against anything that will defraud or harm (e.g CP, credit card info), apart from guns, but that&#039;s a stretch.

				Hello journalist trying to get a story. If you are board trying to make silly threads here then what I suggest you do is get an iPhone, shove it deep inside your ass and then call yourself until you pass out from cumming too much.<br /><br />Love from Lim

I suggest you give up that idea and request this thread`s removal/closure for most will not take this lightly.
