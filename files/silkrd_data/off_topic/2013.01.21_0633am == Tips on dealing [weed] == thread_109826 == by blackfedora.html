				Always price accordingly to the product you&#039;re distributing. Even if it&#039;s x10 better than anything else available.<br /><br />Never short the bag. Get digi scales<br /><br />Buy a prepaid phone with texting - only use it for business and have it saved in clients phone under a pseudonym name. <br /><br />Keep your area of distribution away from your place of residence. <br /><br />In a perfect world you&#039;ll be able to find 4 trusted ppl that need semi-bulk on a regular schedule; who will nickle and dime so you don&#039;t have to. <br /><br />

				sell to and through your friends. like a&nbsp; web of connections. you deal to people you know and they will help out their friends and so on...<br />don&#039;t sell to people you don&#039;t know. if your friend brings a newbie to the circle don&#039;t sell to him. sell to your friend and he will sort him out.<br /><br />also sell proper amounts. try to stay honest and don&#039;t fuck your customers over.&nbsp; <br />don&#039;t brag about selling.&nbsp; don&#039;t try to pick up girls with it. seriously. not a good idea. <br />don&#039;t act gangsta. get a job if you don&#039;t already have one. dress normal, get a good haircut and try to look like an upstanding citizen of the society. <br />don&#039;t drive drunk/stoned/whatever.<br />if you encounter a leo officer you should always treat him with respect. Don&#039;t insult him, don&#039;t be aggressive, and don&#039;t start asking for a lawyer right away. only answer questions with yes or no and don&#039;t start telling stories. learn about hiding places and read books about body language.

				Around here cops can tune into the wireless cameras at most gas stations and plazas. DO NOT sell dope at these places.<br />Meeting the people or delivering to them is always best but watch where you do your hand to hand transactions. If a place looks too busy for a quick meet, go for a ride.

				Don&#039;t front anyone anything. If they don&#039;t have the money, they don&#039;t need the dope.

				can all vary depending on the level you&#039;re dealing with, yes in a perfect world like barijuana mentioned above selling in bulk is easiest, and if you do it right somewhat safer...however at this point you can very well be the target of law enforcement. So it&#039;s totally necessary to take all the necessary precautions everyone above me has already listed.<br /><br />but, if you are just selling locally, nickle and diming, not having more than an ounce or two at a time on you, well, at least in the city I live in, cops could not care two shits about you. If you just stick to selling small time to your friends, I honestly do not even think the effort of getting a burner and making all your friends always address you by a pseudonym/have you in their phone as a pseudonym is really worth it for a small time pot dealer in a large city dealing to college kids. If they really wanted to bust you, I think they could easily find you through your network of buyers. <br /><br />Not that they ever would, I know for a fact in my city if you are ticketed for a small amount of pot they never try and find out your dealer or any of that shit, it&#039;s decriminalized in my US city anyways, and the cops have a thriving homicide problem to deal with.<br /><br />HOWEVER, all of what I just said obviously does not apply to anywhere but a major city with lax pot laws.

				I don&#039;t really know what to tell you, it&#039;s remarkably easy (for me at least).<br /><br />I suppose the most important thing is to be ahead of the present in your mind (plan shit out!!!).&nbsp; Know exactly how much you are getting your weed for and how much you can sell it for, don&#039;t trust ANYBODY, and don&#039;t do something that in your gut feels fishy or wrong.&nbsp; Planning out all your moves before you make them is key though.&nbsp; And remember, big brother is watching everywhere.&nbsp; I have to say though, if you are not a very intelligent person you will only end up losing money and possibly face much worse consequences.&nbsp; The fact you need to ask how to do it shows me you really need to plan your shit out better.&nbsp; Start small until you know how it&#039;s done.

				always count the money before you give them the product.<br /><br />always have them meet in your car in a parking lot.<br /><br />careful about ppl asking for large amounts.
