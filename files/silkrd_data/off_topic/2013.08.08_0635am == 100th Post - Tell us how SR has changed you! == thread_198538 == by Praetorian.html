				&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Well, there it is... 100 posts, no more captcha, and I can finally start dishing out some Karma!<br /><br />In one paragraph or less, how has Silk Road changed your life?<br /><br />Silk Road has provided me the outlet to stop working for the federal government, and support myself with smart, calculated drug deals.&nbsp; I can see, and often find valid reviews on products before I buy them, and can often find bulk deals that I would otherwise have to go through some people I cannot be seen with to acquire. Silk Road has allowed me to be free from my employ of the Man.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />+1 to all those who have something worth saying, as now I can do that!

				Many years ago, most illegal drugs other than cannabis were manufactured by pharmaceutical companies. They reached the street via doctors&#039; prescriptions or thefts from local stores (except for LSD which was distributed by Sandoz). With care one could buy known drugs of known purity, usually as ampules or branded pills. When government regulations stemmed the flow, powders began to appear. What they contained (if anything) had to be taken on trust, and could be cut by as much as 100:1. Now, once again, thanks to SR, one can buy (with care) known drugs of known purity. My quality of life has been improved immeasurably.

				Silk Road has allowed me to finally get my hands on some very rare and potent psychedelics. DMT and LSD to be exact. Both have given me life-altering experiences. To me, that is priceless.

				We used to get ripped off constantly , Taking fake drugs in parties for outrages prices, We use to feel unsafe every time we tried anything concerning it&#039;s not the real thing. the &#039; Straw that broke the camel back &#039; As when they sold us 25i blotters for 25$ a piece as LSD. and than we said NO MORE! that when we gave silkroad the first try. Since than i have to say that our life or &#039;drug habits&#039; have changed for good! We feel much more safe and secured knowing that we&#039;re using quality drugs that have been used and recommended by other people !
