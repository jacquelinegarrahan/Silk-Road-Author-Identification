				Felt this needed to be posted if you weren&#039;t aware already. This story brought tears to my eyes and all because the parents smoke pot??? WTF is this world coming to?<br /><br />LE I HOPE YOU READ THIS...please look what your failed policies do to families and this country. An innocent child very much loved and cared for by her parents taken away because of fucking POT only to be killed by your bullshit system!!! Take a child away from loving parents for something that is virtually harmless. There is a special place in hell for you!<br /><br /><br />Toddler killed after taken by Child Protective Services from her parents<br /><br />Published time: August 06, 2013 18:01<br />Edited time: August 06, 2013 23:17<br /><br /><br />The foster mother of a 2-year-old Texas girl has been charged with murder after the toddler she brought into her home earlier this year died last week from a severe head injury.<br /><br />Alexandria Hill was placed into the custody of 54-year-old Sherill Small in January after the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services determined she was being neglected by her previous foster parents. Now Small is being held on $100,000 bond after Hill passed away last Wednesday while in her care.<br /><br />The girl’s biological father, Joshua Hill, told KVUE-TV that he and Alexandria’s mother lost full custody of their daughter last November after the DFPS accused them of “neglectful supervision.” Mr. Hill said the agency made that determination &quot;because her mother and I smoked pot at the time.&quot; According to the father, the parents only smoked while their daughter was asleep.<br /><br />“We never hurt our daughter,” Mr. Hill told KVUE on Thursday. “She was never sick, she was never in the hospital, and she never had any issues until she went into state care.”<br /><br />It was only then, Hill said, that things started to go wrong.<br /><br />“She would come to visitation with bruises on her, and mold and mildew in her bag. It got to a point where I actually told CPS [Child Protective Services] that they would have to have me arrested because I wouldn&#039;t let her go back,&quot; he told KVUE.<br /><br />Then seven months ago, Alexandria was placed into Small’s house in Rockdale, Texas, where her biological parents were allowed to make occasional visits. That all ended last week, though, after the girl died at an area hospital.<br /><br />Hill told KVUE that he got a phone call Monday night telling him his daughter was on life support at the Scott and White Children’s Emergency Hospital in Temple, Texas.<br /><br />“They wouldn&#039;t tell me what condition she was in or what was wrong or what had happened. The only thing they would tell me is I needed to be there. When I got there, I found out that Alex was in a coma,” he said.<br /><br />To make matters even more confusing, the adopted mother altered her story after Alexandria was admitted to the hospital. First Small told investigators during a routine police report that she had been spinning the girl around in circles when she accidentally let go of Alexandria’s hands, sending the child to the ground where she hit her head on the carpet. During a physical examination, however, doctors found three symptoms of traumatic brain injury and began asking more questions. The foster mom later admitted to being frustrated with the girl and swinging her over her head and down near the ground with a “lot of force” three times. On the third time, Alexandria’s head hit the floor.<br /><br />Police arrested Small on Thursday after her foster child’s death and charged her with criminal homicide, a first-degree felony in Texas. An autopsy report released the following day concluded that blunt-force trauma to the head caused the girl’s death.<br /><br />A spokesperson for the Texas DFPS told KXAN News that Small was previously accused of neglect after a child in her care was reportedly suffering from bruising and lead poisoning, “but no deficiencies were found.” A second foster child was removed from her care on Monday.

				It is stuff like this that makes me sick to my stomach.<br /><br />How can alcohol be legal and weed gets this kind of bad vibe. Very disheartening.

				That&#039;s unfortunate. I remember hearing that child abuse, molestation, etc., is not all that uncommon when CPS removes the kids from their parents. Sure in some cases there is a genuine need to do that, but it&#039;s pretty easy for false accusations to get children taken away.

				And this is why we HAVE TO win the war on drugs.<br /><br />Only 3 people &#039;foster&#039; (temporarily care for) children in the system.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Pedophiles.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Crazy, batty old women who never had children of their own; or did but they all grew up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Church-folk. <br /><br />I would say a young, liberal-minded pot-head is better fit for parenting than all 3 of the above.

				Fuckin disgusting!! In the UK a kid was killed by his mum and stepdad after being tortured, beaten, and starved. The school noticed, social services knew and so did the police, yet not one of them removed this child from the home, he was less than half the weight he should,ve been for his age, he was stealing food at school including eating pancaks from a pancake race on sports day, the authorities don,t do their job when they should and in other cases stick their noses in and fuck up where their not needed :( So So sad!

				Thanks for reading and your replies everyone.<br /><br />Yeah just like most of you I honestly can say reading this made me sick to my stomach like many of you. Sadly this is just one idiot in the CPS system that got caught but I&#039;m sure there are so many stories like this that never get told, much less make it to the news.<br /><br />And the sad part is that you get more stories about messed up shit like this going on in the US from Russia Today. Funny how you get more truth about the US from anothers countries news organization.

				It is important to note that CPS, while may have there flaws, does do a lot of great work. I grew up in an abusive family and was taken in by CPS at a young age. If it wasn&#039;t for CPS who knows if I would even be alive today. I would sometimes not be given food for an entire day. Granted alcohol was the poison that ruined my family, still. Without CPS I really think I would have ended up dying if not killing myself.

				From the families that I have seen applying for that shit, the probability of you getting a foster parent worse than your original parents is about 33%.

				Anyone that would hurt a child should be killed, It&#039;s really that simple in my book.<br /><br />No trials, No kangaroo courts, Just a .44 magnum to the back of the head.
