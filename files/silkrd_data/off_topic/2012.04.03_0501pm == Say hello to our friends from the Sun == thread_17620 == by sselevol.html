				As most of you are aware SR appeared in the Sun newspaper in the UK.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17333.msg172374#msg172374<br /><br />Of course, googling &#039;dark web drugs&#039; will bring up many guides to downloading tor and the address to access SR, so it&#039;s conceivable that readers and reporters from the sun are lurking these forums right now. Don&#039;t be a stranger! Say hi.

				I&#039;m assuming any of the journalists using scare-tactics and sensationalism have never done any illegal substances? <br /><br />Nah, they&#039;re probably just drunks.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine any kind of hypocrisy involved with mainstream media.

				Hello Journalists! I greet you from the silk road! May I advise though, don&#039;t stay long. Since my first venture here i&#039;ve taken to aborting other peoples babies, supporting terrorisim, and generally destroying every moral of fiber the world has to offer.

				I know its The Sun, but what ever happened to objective journalism. I know the sun is not known for it, but how about asking around, finding why we use the site, what the thoughts are from the site owner, finding out the truth. <br /><br />Again, I know it was The Sun and they aren&#039;t known for reporting facts. But maybe we should have a sticky for journalists to read (almost an official press statement if you like) That we can all add our reasons for using the site, what brought us here etc. DPR can give his thoughts. <br /><br />I&#039;m not talking 100 posts of &quot;fuck off journos&quot; But an actual coherent thread that will give any journalist our views. It wouldn&#039;t change their minds but may give them a better understanding of the site and our reasons. <br /><br />The other thing they need to remember (especially The Sun) is that most people here are at least average intelligence or above. We have a Drug Safety section, and most are willing to answer questions. Most are making an informed decision on their drug of choice and its safer here than IRL. The war on drugs has been lost, and the battle is now beginning.<br /><br />That&#039;s my opinion anyway
