				Wow just trolling around and reading some of the shit that goes on here makes me look at this place in a whole new perspective.<br /><br />The opportunity to scam here is just too high. Its a sad but true fact that people fucking suck and will scam honest people whenever they have a chance. SR is the perfect way to scam hardworking people out of their hard earned bitcoins!

				OK, point taken BUT<br />1.&nbsp; Most of the scams occur because people go out of escrow.&nbsp; If a seller requires early finalization, you don&#039;t have to order from Him.&nbsp; You never HAVE to finalize early. <br /><br />2.&nbsp; Use and read the feedback.&nbsp; There are vendors on here with stellar records.&nbsp; Once you establish a relationship with a vendor, it is smart to stay with that vendor.&nbsp; You are then working in escrow with a vendor that you have an established relationship with.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; If you want to order from a new vendor, start small.&nbsp; It makes no sense to order 3 ounces of weed and then to finalize early. <br /><br />I guess I would agree that there is a lot of scamming and a lot of potential for scamming.&nbsp; BUT I also have several vendors in my saved list that I have a high degree of trust in them.&nbsp; They are responsive to messages, their packaging is excellent and they are here for continued business over the long haul.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are some very mature and professional vendors on these boards.<br /><br />Overall, I would say SR is a very positive experience but you do have to do some due diligence to find out who is solid<br /><br />

				In the last few weeks since I have arrived here I have had around 20 purchases, I encountered NO scamming. Its probably easy to get scammed if you dont do your research on the forums, <br />and I only buy from very reputable vendors.

The scams here mostly stem from people being way too trusting. Just don&#039;t let yourself be tricked into going out of escrow. And seriously; START SMALL! Don&#039;t order bulk off of brand new vendors with no feedback. It&#039;s pointless to spend any money you aren&#039;t willing to lose.<br /><br />Also, if it&#039;s too good to be true, it&#039;s way too fucking good to be true.

				I just want to add that i also have never been scammed. I have finalized early one one transaction and the guy came through as promised. I just see what is going on around the forums and these fuckin scammers piss me off. <br /><br />I know exactly what they are about and its sickening. This place has the potential to be the greatest place in the world to buy drugs....its really up to the people. ALL SCAMMERS FUCKING DIE!

Good luck getting it on the streets, because it sounds like we won&#039;t see you doing business on SR any more. You must know the type of drug dealers that won&#039;t scam you out of your money at every given opportunity, not to mention come to where you live and rob you or hurt one or more of your family members.<br /><br />&nbsp;I always ask to see their diplomas from one of the many accredited drug-dealing schools of commerce and check their backgrounds, and if I have a complaint I just file with the Better Drug Dealer&#039;s Bureau to report them.<br /><br />

				Listen up people, it&#039;s never personal only business... Understand what this means. this simply mean never trust no one in underground business!!! I don&#039;t care how long you have been knowing them or doing business with them!!! You never know what the other person is going through. He may have been recently caught by the authorities and/or robbed and is in desperate need of money. And just who do you think he&#039;s going to turn to and rob??? The only people he can....HIS CUSTOMERS!!!! So with that being said TRUST NO ONE!!!&nbsp; NEVER LET THE RIGHT HAND KNOW WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING....

				It&#039;s all about the escrow. Seriously. I&#039;m serious.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Scammers hate escrow. Hate it. They hate it. <br /><br />And there you have it. Enjoy your tenure here at SR. ;)
