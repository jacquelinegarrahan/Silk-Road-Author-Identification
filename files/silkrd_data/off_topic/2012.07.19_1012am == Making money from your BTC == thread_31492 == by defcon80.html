This isn&#039;t as heady as the rates currently being bandied around but firstly it&#039;s sustainable and second your original investment is guaranteed! <br /><br />More info : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/23cd2cd838<br /><br />I make my money to some extent from investing in Bitcoin mining based on renewable energy but mainly from the precious metals market plus securities in &quot;blue chip&quot; companies. There&#039;s no risk to you as the investor.<br /><br />If you want to trust the &quot;Pirate&quot; bonds being offered on the Bitcointalk forum and GLBSE I would recommend you invest no more than 5% of your Portfolio in it as the whole thing smacks of a pyramid scheme for me. I could explain why I feel this articulately but luckily the BitcoinTrader&#039;s blog has done this for me:<br /><br />http://www.thebitcointrader.com/2012/05/bitcoin-stock-market-miners-and-pirates.html<br /><br />V.

As you say so far (I say so far!) the Pirate has paid up like clockwork. You would usually expect a pyramid scheme to teeter after a few months however some have existed for much longer. Midland Euro for instance ran for about four&nbsp; years - and of course Petters Group Worldwide ran for nearly fifteen.<br /><br />Several possibilities are listed in the article in question including that the Pirate may not be aware himself that he&#039;s investing cash in a Russian pyramid scheme outside the Bitcoin network. There&#039;s also the possibility that he&#039;s making use of several such schemes and is simply reinvesting clients money in newer ones as older ones start to go bad.<br /><br />My (limited) experience of such firms is that they are not usually entirely reliant on Ponzi schemes to make money but will also bolster their funds through legitimate trading, if only so they can justify the huge returns promised.<br /><br />You&#039;re absolutely right in thinking of the scheme in these terms though i.e whose 70 Bitcoins are you getting. If this is a Ponzi, then the answer is that you&#039;re getting them from earlier investors in the scheme. <br /><br />The question for me is when the whole house of cards comes crashing down. I have talked about this with my Mentor who has worked in my department (Hedge Funds) for nearly thirty years and he says that this kind of scheme is unsustainable - does anyone really believe that if they invested USD 1000 they&#039;d be a millionaire within two years? <br /><br />I don&#039;t promise this but I can promise to keep your original investment safe! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The interest rates on loans from the Pirate Bank don&#039;t marry up with the promised rate of returns to Investors. Similarly making money from trading off the Bitcoin against various exchanges begs the question how he can avoid driving the Bitcoin price down through his very efforts.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t use the bonds and never would - there are some mining pools listed on GLBSE which I&#039;ve dabbled in and certainly the Asset Backed Securities look promising but anything else is your ass!

As you say so far (I say so far!) the Pirate has paid up like clockwork. You would usually expect a pyramid scheme to teeter after a few months however some have existed for much longer. Midland Euro for instance ran for about four&nbsp; years - and of course Petters Group Worldwide ran for nearly fifteen.<br /><br />Several possibilities are listed in the article in question including that the Pirate may not be aware himself that he&#039;s investing cash in a Russian pyramid scheme outside the Bitcoin network. There&#039;s also the possibility that he&#039;s making use of several such schemes and is simply reinvesting clients money in newer ones as older ones start to go bad.<br /><br />My (limited) experience of such firms is that they are not usually entirely reliant on Ponzi schemes to make money but will also bolster their funds through legitimate trading, if only so they can justify the huge returns promised.<br /><br />You&#039;re absolutely right in thinking of the scheme in these terms though i.e whose 70 Bitcoins are you getting. If this is a Ponzi, then the answer is that you&#039;re getting them from earlier investors in the scheme. <br /><br />The question for me is when the whole house of cards comes crashing down. I have talked about this with my Mentor who has worked in my department (Hedge Funds) for nearly thirty years and he says that this kind of scheme is unsustainable - does anyone really believe that if they invested USD 1000 they&#039;d be a millionaire within two years? <br /><br />I don&#039;t promise this but I can promise to keep your original investment safe! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />its unsustainable for&nbsp; many reasons and it relys on people being stupid&nbsp; or greedy or both&nbsp; (textbook&nbsp; ponzi material )<br /><br />someone worked it out that if you invested 1000 coins with pirate at 7.2% (compounding the interest every week with the principal )<br />&nbsp;in&nbsp; 3 years you would more&nbsp; than all 22 million bitcoins&nbsp; (including the ones that havent been mined yet ) :D<br /><br />by this very logic ,its only a matter of time before the system defaults on itself <br /><br />this is where it gets more complicated ,its rumoured he has upwards of 300,000 btc,some say more than 500k+&nbsp; ,eventually hes going to be paying interest in BTC&nbsp; at a faster rate <br />than the coins themselves are being mined ,since most people are hoarding coins as the price goes up and the block difficulty increases coins will only become more expensive <br /><br /><br />Im still trying to figure if i take $700 out every monday ,has that $700 come from someone on a lower level than me ? or has it come from someone on a higher level who is compound <br />saving their interest or is it someones principal or is it pirates own cash to keep the scheme going until its prime time to cash out with a few million dollars worth of everyones&nbsp; coins&nbsp; ?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey Vlad, a couple of questions if you don&#039;t mind.<br />1. Do you have anyone on this forum who can support your zero-risk claim and will they post so?<br />2. What is your minimum required investment amount?<br />3. What is your maximum accepted investment amount?<br />4. Can investments be allowed to compound?<br />5. Can we get higher return rate on longer investment periods?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />-Mana

				I can vouch 100% for vlad, ManaFromHeaven. If you wish to ask any questions i am a client of his and he does offer various &#039;packages&#039; and they are all zero risk but some involve higher returns but a chance of only 100% return.

Cozmo has very kindly vouched for my program in the post below as he has been a client of mine for a while. Thanks Cozmo!<br />2. One Bitcoin.<br />3. My scheme works in such a way that for every Bitcoin you invest I have another kept safely so there&#039;s no risk to you. At the moment I have 300 Bitcoins but this will change over time as both our investments grow. For now though the maximum is BTC 300.<br />4. By all means!<br />5. Yes, and in fact I&#039;m sure Cozmo won&#039;t mind me saying this is what I am doing for him. Feel free to message me for more details.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				Without reading the 35 pages on Bitcoinmax, Im curious if anyone has brought up the points there that you guys have here, and if so how he addresses them.<br />Also, is this a scheme or a scam? I agree with the logic that has been said here and I dont see how it could sustain itself, but the question is what happens to those with investments when it does fall apart? Will they be screwed out of their investment? Unfortunately I dont understand money well enough. The greedy side of me wants to invest in this and at least make some scratch before it goes south, but not if the risk is losing everything.

				i have read all the pages and it does look like a scheme where people get paid from the people joining&nbsp; after them ,such schemes are not permanently sustainable&nbsp; and if everyone were to withdraw at the same time it would it would collapse although sometimes this doesnt happen for years <br /><br />bernie madoff ran a bigger version of this and he made it last around 39 years&nbsp; investigators believe&nbsp; &nbsp; ,he paid interest regularly every month (even in financial crisis bernie reported monthly&nbsp; profits ;) <br /><br />great story<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Madoff<br /><br />
