				Cocaine. If I&#039;m on the go I lick the side of my ciggies and roll them in Rip to have on the go. You just need to take the but out the fag tip and take a bit off it and then put it back in.

				When I&#039;m super lucky, and can get some good black tar, I love to lace my weed with it. First I grind up some of the stinkiest weed I can find. Usually some diesel strain, it has to be good and dry. Then I dissolve the tar in a little water, then add and some weed, mix it up good, then let the weed dry out again. Yummy!&nbsp;

				If people haven&#039;t tried the following you must do it and you&#039;re welcome.<br /><br />I am a medical cannabis grower. I have plenty of Cannabis, hash oil, and hash. <br /><br />1: Pick up a sexy premium bowl sized bud.<br />1: Dunk it in some quality oil submerging the beauty.<br />3: Put it in a container full of fresh noncompressed dry ice hash and lightly shake.<br />4: Put this in your bowl and enjoy a shake n bake you won&#039;t be able to finish.

				Actually, I put it in a pipe at a party. Took a hit and I was done for the night. It ended up being oil goop at the end with a dozen people wondering how it wasn&#039;t finished. One person trying to finish it? Yeah instant coma. Great as a party favor though.
