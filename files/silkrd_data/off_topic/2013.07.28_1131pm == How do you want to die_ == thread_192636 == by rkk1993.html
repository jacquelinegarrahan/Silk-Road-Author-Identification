				I&#039;m shure this has been a thread before but here we go anyway.<br /><br />How do you want to die? If you could pick the way you leave this world what would it be? Details would be cool to hear the reasons.<br /><br /><br />Ok so at this moment if I had to pick the way I die I think that it would be tripping from a substance that is dangerous and overdosing on it. Something like doing so much 25i that you trip into hyperspace and die. I would just like to see how that is and what it would be like. And then when you die have the massive realease of dmt to end ur trip/start it. even though im not shure if it would be painfull or not i think thats the way i want to die.<br /><br />By no means am I suicidal so dont ask in your replies and this is all hypothetical. I hope this gets some good post!

				Sex of course. In the middle of a really intense orgasm with the help of drugs. Probably molly.<br /><br />Or maybe jumping in a volcano. Or running from an avalanche. I want to see something really cool before I go or I want to feel awesome.<br /><br />Fuck dying by sharks though.

				The perfect suicide-induced death for me would definetely be a yummy mix of alcohol (I don&#039;t drink, so I have no tolerance), benzos and opiates (ingested in this order). Before I would take the opiates (a mix of oxy and heroin, probably up the butt so I get all the possible effects), I would smoke the biggest, dankest joint in the fucking world :) I&#039;d enjoy the buzz for 10-15 minutes, put my headphones on and go for it. Straight to heaven :)<br /><br />My perfect natural death would be to die while sleeping. Classic, but seriously, what could be better?<br /><br />STAY SAFE&nbsp; :-*<br />

				This thread makes me wanna die charging into a raging bloody battlefield filled with histories strongest ancient warriors naked, dodging spears, daggers and arrows under an African sunset, fighting for days, pitting our brute wills against one another. Then at the peak of the battle an eagle would fly just over my head grazing my hair and I would throw my arms forth into the sky, letting out a liberating battle cry, shaking my head into the wind as a barrage of arrows descends upon me, piercing my body one by one, sending me falling to my knees cinematically in slow motion while reaching toward the sky with one last tear trickling from my eye where my spirit would then leave my body, riding a flaming unicorn into the cosmos with my arms spread out as if they were wings where I&#039;d take my throne in the stars as master of the universe.

				I want to die when I am still in a good mentally and physically place.<br />I do not wish to be one of those 90 year olds you see sitting on the bench, along and crippled when you go to the shops. Or somebody with dementia. Fuck that.<br />I wish to did at my peak, or sometime before my steep decline. So probably sometime before I&#039;m 75. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how I want to die. A part of me wishes we could be given 1000 lives so we could try different ways of dying to see what it feels like.<br />A sickness that I am aware of and can prepare for would be good, but I would end my own life before I got to a state where I was in constant pain and lost mobility.<br />Pro-euthanasia!

				I don&#039;t want to be there when it happens.<br /><br />But if I am, then in a far-out state of consciousness from a psychedelic. The farther out, the better. It occurs to me that the changeover from hyperspace to the &quot;other side&quot; shouldn&#039;t be two jarring.
