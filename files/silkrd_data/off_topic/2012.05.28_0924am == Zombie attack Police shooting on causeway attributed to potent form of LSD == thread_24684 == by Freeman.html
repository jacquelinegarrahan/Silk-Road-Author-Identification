				I can&#039;t fucking believe this bullshit.&nbsp; I mean, I live in the United States of War on Drugs and I can&#039;t believe this shit.<br /><br />Police say the attacker was likely overdosing on a new potent form of LSD. &quot;What&#039;s happening is whenever we see that a person has taken all of his clothes off and has become violent, it’s indicative of this excited delirium that&#039;s caused by overdose of drugs,” said Armando Aguilar of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police. “What&#039;s happening is inside their body their organs are burning up alive.”<br /><br />Read more: http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/local/21007585058418/new-details-emerge-in-causeway-police-involved-shooting/#ixzz1w9bXZDQt

				Yeah, my guess is PCP but the head of the police union calling it &quot;new potent form of LSD&quot; is just ludicrous.&nbsp; It&#039;s not uncommon for people on PCP to feel like they&#039;re overheating and get naked much like the guy in &quot;American Drug War&quot; that went into the bar naked and started trying to shove ice up his ass.

				I saw this earlier today, been pissed ever since. What the fuck is wrong with these cocksuckers? What purpose does wild speculation, and outright lies by the police/media serve? Wouldn&#039;t it be better for everyone if they reported facts, and not bullshit? Could LSD possibly get any more potent. I mean you get like 10,000 hits from a gram, lol<br /><br />The sad thing is most folks just take it for granted that everything these cocksucking liars say is true, too ignorant to know better or even take advantage of Google. I am really starting to dislike living in this country.<br /><br />It was Miami for god&#039;s sake! This was obviously voodoo.

				MIAMI (CBSMiami) – The crime shocked South Florida and has drawn the attention of the world. A naked man is shot by Miami Police while eating another naked man’s face on the MacArthur Causeway.<br /><br />As the story quickly went viral across the Internet, some have likened the attack to one by a zombie. Details of the unthinkable attack included police reporting that when they ordered the cannibal to stop, he looked up with blood on his face and growled at officers.<br /><br />Click here for the original story about the cannibalistic attack.<br />The suspected cannibal has been identified by the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner’s officer as 31-year-old Rudy Eugene. Eugene may have been homeless at the time of the attack, his last known address was in North Miami.<br /><br /><br />Since news of the unthinkable attack first broke, the big question has been, why? Why did the man attack the other? Why were they naked? Why did the attacker turn into a cannibal on the causeway?<br /><br />The president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, Armando Aguilar believes the entire incident is the fault of a new drug trend that has led to similar incidents. Emergency room doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital said they too have seen a major increase in cases linked to the street drug called “bath salts” or the new LSD.<br /><br /><br />“We noticed an increase probably after Ultra Fest,” said emergency room Dr. Paul Adams, at Jackson Memorial Hospital.<br /><br />In many of the cases, Dr. Adams said the person’s temperature has risen to an extremely high level, they’ve become very aggressive. Some have used their jaws as a weapon during attacks. Dr. Adams said the patients were in a state of delirium.<br /><br />“Extremely strong, I took care of a 150 pound individual who you would have thought he was 250 pounds,” Dr. Adams said. “It took six security officers to restrain the individual.”<br /><br />Adams said the extreme strength and violence of patients on “bath salts” has become a significant threat to all those charged with the task of trying to help those high on the drug.<br /><br />“It’s dangerous for the police,” Adams said. “It’s dangerous for the fire fighters. It’s dangers for the hospital workers taking care of them because they come in, they have to be restrained both chemically and physically and you’re asking for someone to get hurt.”<br /><br />Aguilar said drug dealers aren’t aware that the liability could fall back on them.<br /><br />“I have a message for whoever is selling it out there,” said Aguilar. “You can be arrested for murder if you are selling this LSD to people, unsuspecting people on the street and somebody ends up dying as a result you will be charged with murder.”

Simply because a &quot;New more potent form of LSD&quot; is a chemical impossibility. There is no such thing as LSD Mk 2 lets say. If you change the chemical structure, it ceases to be LSD and becomes a different, even if related, chemical. In chemistry there is only one thing or another and the different isomers which is even more impossible with LSD because it&#039;s completely chiral. Basically this is just another example of some shit-faced-cock-masters not knowing whaaaat the fuck they are talking about. Yawn.

				Why is no one blaming zombie movies?&nbsp; I mean, they could have just finished watching a zombie movie marathon, been on their way to the store for some munchies and the recent assault of violent imagery could have triggered some latent zombie tendencies. <br />Someone write a letter to Chuck Schumer and see if we can&#039;t get horror movies banned!<br />And they were naked because it&#039;s south florida and it&#039;s hot as fuck down there. :P

				Well they need to scare people from LSD in some way, I guessing confusing MDPV cannibal zombies with LSD hippies is one way to do it. MDPV is such a shitty drug it has an enormously high correlation with psychosis.
