				I&#039;m a pretty new vendor but feel I have a fair grasp on packaging my products for shipping.I routinely wear gloves and wipe down everything.<br />&nbsp;(if you&#039;re OCD and you know it- Wash your hands). My fear is that at some point in time I have to handle the packing materials without gloves, usually when acquiring the envelopes and boxes at the post office.<br />I guess my real question is what common packing materials hold fingerprints best?<br />Can the oils on your fingers bleed into cardboard and leave a &quot;record&quot; of your fingerprint that can&#039;t be wiped away?<br />I know MY prints are already in circulation with L.E. and I don&#039;t want to try to explain to the DEA(multi billion dollar a year rip off) why my prints are inside the box full of dope.<br />Also if you touch thermal paper from a printer will you be able to wipe prints off that?<br />What about&nbsp; mylar?<br />someone out there has to know more than what they saw on N.C.I.S.

				Only about half joking here...<br /><br />Get yourself a glove box isolator and start treating the drugs like a scientist treats a deadly virus.<br /><br />Pretty sure you could build one pretty cheap, for your purposes they don&#039;t need to be hermetically sealed just tight enough to avoid stray hairs and the like.<br /><br />Open the drugs inside, package them inside, place the packages in a plastic bag inside, drop contents of plastic bag into mail box, burn the plastic bag and all preceding baggies, boxes and envelopes immediately after use. <br /><br />It&#039;s totally overkill but you seem to be looking for the next level so there it is.
