				After seeing the main site get a facelift a few weeks ago, I was thinking they should do the same to the forums page. I&#039;ve been here for a little over a month and have come across some pretty interesting and koo people. Knowing that most of us are here for the same reason, I think it would be nice to have a more expanded forum to have fun and or discuss other topics. The closest thing we have is the &quot;off topic&quot; sub forum. The admins could make a new section on the main forums page called &quot;General Topics&quot;. They could either delete the &quot;off topic&quot; sub forum, merge it or just move it under the new section. <br />In that section it could have up to four to five sub forums that would look something like the example below. I randomly picked the topics but we could obviously do a poll on what topics we would actually want. I think it would benefit the site to add some type of entertainment other than laughing at people who get scammed after being warned about certain vendors. Or maybe that&#039;s just me but what do you guys think?<br /><br />General Topics.<br /><br />*Deep Discussions-<br />This is to discuss or debate science, space, religion vs. non religion, the mind on drugs, conspiracy theories, paranormal ect. <br /><br />*Movies/T.V. Shows-<br />Share and or discuss movies, shows, documentaries, short films ect.<br /><br />*Career/Schooling-<br />Share advice on the best career fields, going back to college or for the first time, current career, past jobs<br /><br />*Sports-<br />Bet coins with members on sporting events, share fave teams, fantasy sports talk, any other talk involving sports<br /><br />*Talk Tech-<br />Jail breaking phones, iphones, andriods, ps3,xbox, computer discussions<br /><br />*Off Topic- <br />Post anything here that doesn&#039;t belong in the other topics (if they haven&#039;t deleted it)<br /><br />

Maybe SR could become a social network that does not sell it&#039;s user&#039;s details to the highest bidder.

				I would not complain if it had a section for trip reports for the products of SR vendors, a section specifically for posting documents / news articles related to online drug scene or LE information,&nbsp; and possibly a hacking/programming section , but other than that it seems fine to me. It should definitely not have a section for music, tv, career, school or sports, some because they are stupid to include on a drug forum and others because they are stupid and would lead to profiling. A section for deeper discussions would not bother me but I can entirely live with out it. Most of those things are already being discussed in off topic anyway. <br /><br /><br />
