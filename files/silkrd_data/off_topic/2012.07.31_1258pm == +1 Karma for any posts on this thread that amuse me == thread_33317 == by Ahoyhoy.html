				I once worked with some East Europeans, from Belarus. They were working on a site with me.<br /><br />One night (it was a night shift) I had a nightmare about being strangled. I woke up and was being strangled by some crazy guy talking some foreign language.<br /><br />The bastard saw me asleep and smelt the hash I had been smoking in a workers canteen we used to crash out.<br /><br />The foreign guy hated drugs! Called me a &#039;druggie&#039;. One of the other guys threatened him and we explained through an interpreter that the Belarus guys were often found sleeping drunk. We let that go. We explained how hash was just normal on an English building site. We ended up on good terms as the younger guys smoked hash with us and we drank the hooch they bought from Belarus, kind of 100% alcohol, tasted like shit.<br /><br />The &#039;anti drug guy&#039; was the worse drunkard of all. He was told he would be sent home if he assaulted anyone. But not after we threw him off the building and the amount of alcohol in his body would make it seem like an accident. Most nights I had to tell his buddies to send him to sleep in our sleep hideaways on the site.<br /><br />Nothing worse than working with some whining bastard who thinks drugs are all evil whilst alcohol is good.<br /><br />Alcohol is a drug you fucking asshole thug from Belarus!!<br /><br />I was a few seconds from being unconscious. Guy was so big he almost stopped the blood going to my brain rather than just strangle me by depriving my lungs of air.<br /><br />By the way, donate the BTC to mod if I win!<br /><br />Generosity of spirit!<br /><br />Plus I&#039;m lucky enough to work at a time when its not easy out there!<br /><br />Working right now!<br /><br />Laters!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				A 9 month pregnant woman wakes up in a panic on the first of April -- The delivery date has come with a vengeance.<br /><br />She shakes her husband and he snaps to attention and, promptly with much haste, they are off in a high speed drive to the hospital. <br /><br />The delivery takes hours of heaves and hoes, push and pulls, breaths and screams. <br /><br />In one final push, the baby is born and the Doctor does an orchestrated flurry of pull, snip, wrap and cradle; programmed by years of experience and practice. He looks down onto the newborn and his head tilts to the side with his mouth curling into a tucked in frown. Without a word he and the baby waltz out of the delivery room.<br /><br />The woman looks to her husband wide eyed and with confusion. Minutes go by, which feel like hours to the new parents, when finally the door opens and the Doctor walks in with a smile on his face now and a blue blanket wrapped baby. <br /><br />The husband looks to his wife wildly excitedly, &quot;It&#039;s a boy, honey. A baby boy!&quot;<br /><br />The Doctor nods as to confirm his clearly bold assumptions. He walks towards the parents and the nappy-looking and tired woman is revitalized as she opens her arms to accept her baby. <br /><br />The Doctor extends his arms... and he fucking butterfingers the shit! Sheer terror and shock slam into the couples eyes as they see this pile of baby flesh and blanket plummet to an unforgiving linoleum floor. With the elasticity of a bag of cottage cheese, the baby thuds the ground. <br /><br />The Doctor confesses his extreme apologies as he moves forward to recover the fumble on the play. In doing so, he takes a two step and punts the baby across the room then breaks into a sprint towards it&#039;s point of impact and drops into a power slide on his white lab coat across the floor with his feet extended like a move seen regularly in circa 1990&#039;s Pro Wrestling circuits. Crushing the baby between his extended feet and the wall. In a final and grandiose maneuver he grabs the limp baby by the ankle and swings it above his head thrice and throws it out an open window of 7th floor located hospital room. <br /><br />Turning from the window to the bedside the Doctor wipes his hands and takes deep sigh. The couple, jaws down and in shock, pause for a slight second to absorb what had just happened. After a seemingly endless moment the woman screams at the top of her lungs, &quot;You killed my fucking baby! You fucking monster!&quot;<br /><br />The Doctor swoops to her side and puts a finger on her lips halting her exasperated harpy-like screeching. He shrugs and says, &quot;April Fools!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It was already dead&quot;<br /><br />This joke is entirely in bad taste and I couldn&#039;t be more proud to have it in my arsenal.

				&nbsp; A weary traveler walks into a restaurant and is stopped at the door.

The traveler calmly addresses him and says &quot; I&#039;m sorry, It&#039;s not you that&#039;s the problem. Its the guy next to you. He keeps dipping his fries into your back&quot;.

I&#039;m fine&quot;.<br />&nbsp; A waiter promptly brings him a new plate of food and cleans up the table. The traveler tears into his food once again. However this time he starts to projectile vomit uncontrollably. The leper man turns once again to apologize to the traveler &quot;I&#039;m sorry my appearance has offended you sir, I&#039;ll get up and move so you can eat peacefully&quot;. The traveler once again tell the leper &quot; No sir, it&#039;s ok. It&#039;s not you that&#039;s making me sick. Please eat your lunch and don&#039;t worry about me&quot;. <br />At this point the traveler doesn&#039;t have anything left in him and is dry heaving.&nbsp; The leper man is confused at this point... He says &quot; Well sir, if it isn&#039;t me making you sick, what&#039;s got you so upset&quot;? The traveler calmly addresses him and says &quot; I&#039;m sorry, It&#039;s not you that&#039;s the problem. Its the guy next to you. He keeps dipping his fries into your back&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Thanks. I just ate. Think I&#039;m going to fucking throw up.&nbsp; &nbsp; +1 (begrudgingly)
