				I find myself a little obsessed with watching Cops. I like to observe and know as much as I can about the animal that is my enemy. I feel like it prepares me and teaches me a little bit about how to deal with them, maybe? Anyone else watch it or am I just weird?

				Most definitely agree with you! It helps to know how/what they are thinking and how they handle certain situations. I have used drugs for more than half of my existence here on this planet and while I&#039;ve had some close calls with being pulled over and what not I have a perfectly clean record! Also like to watch Campus PD on G4

				I hate the show. It&#039;s done nothing good for anyone. It&#039;s purpetuated and made entertainment out of the War On Drugs, while brainwashing the masses to march along blindly in support.<br /><br />The first episode of cops that aired was a very early example of the militarization of America&#039;s police force. An L.A. SWAT team was given a fucking military TANK and they drove it right through the wall of a goddamn crack house to announce their raid. A fucking army tank. Ratings went through the roof and COPS became a massive success overnight. It helped condition Americans to become sensitized to militarization of local LE and over the top use of force.... a chilling trend that has only grow (like wild fire) since. <br /><br />Fuck the show COPS and the ever growing militarization of local LE in the US.

				i can&#039;t stand the show at all or any of those shows like them. they portray the cops as these supermen hero types who go round simply mopping up the evil monster wrongdoers. they make it look so black and white when it really isn&#039;t. i&#039;ve had years of experience dealing with cops in real life and they aren&#039;t as clever and great as the shows edit them to look. its like the car chases, they go on like &#039;the cops always get their man&#039; crap. they don&#039;t at all. i&#039;ve had dozens of pursuits and been caught i think twice. most pursuits in my rl experience has ended with the cops losing them. its only the wannabe idiots that get caught most of the time or the drunk drivers.<br /><br />i can also remember when i would first start watching those shows and i was actually noticing how i was getting over cautious with things all because of the things i was seeing on the shows. the idea they put in your head of the pigs having all this awesome technology gets you into the mindset that you&#039;re gonna get caught easily. but their technology is never as effective as they make it out to be. we always find ways to combat it.

				Oh, I definitely know what you mean there. I just find it funny how they try to make em look like the &quot;good guys&quot; while we&#039;re &quot;the bad guys&quot;. I watch it for the irony, I&#039;m certainly not sitting there applauding them by any means. And I pirate it, if that makes any difference. :D<br /><br />However I do understand your negative point of views on it, I don&#039;t want to support something that helps perpetuate everything I&#039;m against. I&#039;ll probably stop watching it on TV at least, don&#039;t wanna add to their ratings.

One of my faves. My other faves include a guy who IVed meth and had to be taken down by quite a few guys, he kept quoting the bible and claiming to be god or something. The other was one where the guy kept yelling about his &quot;freedom of religion,&quot; showing the cop all the snakes he kept in his house and claiming some cheap mariachi doll was his voodoo doll and that he felt compelled to build altars.<br /><br />Even as I write this, I almost want to hang my head in shame that I watch this shit.

				You can indeed learn a lot from watching the cops interact with other criminals and see where they went wrong. I personally like to just show up to court to watch certain drug trials. Cheap entertainment and you can learn a lot.

I&#039;ve drilled it into my head to refuse to incriminate myself by answering any questions EVER, always asking for a lawyer, however it does seem like that&#039;s not always an option in reality. They aren&#039;t supposed to but they will intimidate the fuck outta you.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I&#039;m all about putting cops on camera. I record them on my cell phone anytime one of my friends/family has an issue with them. Last time I did it was when a party got raided and my brother went to jail. They didn&#039;t stop me from doing it, surprisingly.

				To the original question, yeah, I admit it, I watch &quot;Cops&quot;. So when I have something truly nefarious, like I am rocking it up, baller style, I fucking LOVE to watch cops. To me, there are few more satisfying home recreational activities than blowing the top of my head off with a primo rock, with a smokey salute to the poor fucks that get caught up. I always cheer when the suspects evade capture.
