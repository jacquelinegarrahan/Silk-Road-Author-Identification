				I was on Silk Road and found a listing that was named Syntetic hash. abt-00. Countains: chamomile, violet, elecampane, termopsisa, water, thickening agent, ABT-01, essential oils. And i am wanting to refer this to a friend and was wondering if this would show up in drug tests? Primarily urine and hair tests but i am interested in other tests as well.

				Synthetic drugs never really show up on standard tests, especially if their legal. Most workplaces will use a basic wallmart type kit that tests for the basic meth heroin weed mdma. Obviously a high quality lab could find these things if they were specificly searching for them but the chance&nbsp; of that is less than 0.

				Are there many workplaces that will demand employers to do drug tests in the States?<br />I sure hope this is rather the exception than the rule?

It&#039;s fairly common place.<br />But a urine drug screen is by far the most common test - I have yet to meet anyone subjected to a hair follicle<br />test (heard about it on tv, women on contraceptives complaining because it shows up too).
