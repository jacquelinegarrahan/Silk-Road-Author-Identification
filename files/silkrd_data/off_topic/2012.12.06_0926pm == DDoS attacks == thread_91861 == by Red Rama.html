				Not sure if this is the right section, but who here has experience with DDoS or would be interested in coordinating one? Normally I like to keep to myself and keep drug buying on here my one illegal online activity, but I found a deserving target. I got a call earlier saying I&#039;d been selected for a $9,000 grant. Sounded legit and I said I&#039;d take the money as a bank transfer onto my debit card. So I foolishly gave them my debit card info before being transferred to their other line. The new call person informed me I&#039;d need to pay a one time transfer fee of $250 at western union, and that the money would go to some charity and not the government or the company call center. So far nothing has been charged to my account, but I&#039;ll be monitoring my transactions online very scrupulously from now on to make sure it stays that way. What they&#039;re doing is fraud and illegal anyway, so it&#039;s not like they can really go to the police without having it blow back on them. If enough people have time during the day, I&#039;d love to tie up their lines so they&#039;re too busy to fraud innocent people.<br /><br />714-394-8660 is the first number, based out of Anaheim. <br />202-738-4535 is the second number, based out of DC. This is the number you call afterwards to talk to the &quot;Dept. of Treasury&quot; employee who informs you of your transfer fee.<br /><br />I&#039;m totally green when it comes to DDoS, but if anyone is planning one soon and needs a target, or wants to pass the numbers on to whatever Anon boards are out there for this sort of thing, I&#039;d love to hear more. It&#039;s not like this is a Gov. Agency or even just a legit company that might be considered greedy or evil to some, it&#039;s a business/company whose entire business plan is to fraud as many people as they can.

				I don&#039;t know about you guy, but most people here in the US (I don&#039;t know where you are) know this is the oldest trick in the book: &quot;You may have won the grand prize! All we need is a one time payment to...&quot;<br /><br />I mean, this had been going on since the time of Ponzi, I think.<br /><br />goblin

				I&#039;m in the U.S. as well, but my vendor on here sells some very good weed and the weather&#039;s been gloomy. I thought maybe just maybe something good was happening and I could drop the cynicism for a bit. I get it, have a few yucks at my expense, I deserve them, but it&#039;d be nice to actually hear about DDoS related stuff, since that&#039;s the actual topic.

				Sorry, man, I didn&#039;t write that to make yo feel bad. Hope it works out, but really, trying to do something clearly illegal just to get back at them is not what you should be expending energy on.

				You don&#039;t DDoS phones. The term is a white-out.<br /><br />Find a whole bunch of free online sites similar to this http://www.localphone.com/services/dial_online<br /><br />eg for this one - give one number as your own and the other number as your target. They&#039;ll call one, they&#039;ll pick up, then they&#039;ll call the other one. Rinse and repeat with as many as you like.
