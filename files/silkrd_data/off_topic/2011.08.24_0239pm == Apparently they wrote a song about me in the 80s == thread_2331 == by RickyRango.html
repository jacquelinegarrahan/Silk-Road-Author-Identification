				Skidrow - 18 and life to go<br /><br /><br />Ricky was a young boy, He had a heart of stone.<br />Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone. <br />Just barely got out of school, came from the edge of town.<br />Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.<br />He had no money, oooh no good at home. [I have bitcoins though&nbsp; 8)]<br />He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone&nbsp; [and with the help of his friends on Silk Road :D]<br />And now it&#039;s<br /><br />18 and life You got it<br />18 and life you know<br />Your crime is time and it&#039;s<br />18 and life to go<br />(repeat above)<br /><br />Tequila in his heartbeat, His veins burned gasoline.<br />It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean.<br />They say he loved adventure, &quot;Ricky&#039;s the wild one.&quot;<br />He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun. [this is true but I never went all the way ::)]<br />Bang Bang Shoot &#039;em up, The party never ends.<br />You can&#039;t think of dying when the bottle&#039;s your best friend [actually I prefer weed over alcohol ;D]<br />And now it&#039;s<br /><br />chorus<br /><br />&quot;Accidents will happen&quot; they all heard Ricky say<br />He fired his six-shot to the wind that blew a child away. [and then Silk Road got shut down :&#039;(]<br /><br />chorus<br /><br />music video!<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAQq72ULF_g

				You bastard!!! Thank you for officially making me old.&nbsp; That song is over 20 years old and I have it on vinyl in the garage somewhere!<br /><br />Was actually Skidrow&#039;s highest selling single I think.
