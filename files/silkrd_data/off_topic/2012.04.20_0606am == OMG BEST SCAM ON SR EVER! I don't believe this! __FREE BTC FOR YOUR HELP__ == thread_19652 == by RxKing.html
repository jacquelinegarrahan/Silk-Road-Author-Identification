				Hello everyone!<br /><br />So I am going through SR Scam list in this forum and I am looking to see if any of the new buyers I have... have been accused of anything.<br /><br />So I am reading how 1 guy got taken for 1 gram of hash. Another got burned by Toyotaman for $250(fucking sucks) and another sent a guy 1 gram of dope....guy said package never came... so he sent another bag (I believe both bags were 1 gram) and the guy says he didn&#039;t get that bag either ...and this is USA to USA... and is now trying to tell the seller just to give him his money back or he will ruin him in the threads... you know typical behavior on the road.&nbsp; All totally fucked.<br /><br />So then I see a guy says this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3520.msg191703#msg191703">Quote from: perky on April 16, 2012, 04:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">jesusjoints, he robbed me a piece of my paper i put upfront before i down payment on.<br /><br />he wont even answer me, jesus would be very upset with you!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19085.0&nbsp; read me<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />And I was like..... robbed of paper????... I guess he is talking about LSD or something.<br /><br />Side note: I am laughing so hard right now I can not type. I am dying...back to story<br /><br />So I click on link and this comes up:<br /><br />Here is link:http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19085.0%20%20read%20me<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19085.msg191671#msg191671">Quote from: perky on April 16, 2012, 03:48 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">he wanted me to write a paper and get him a grade 6 for 250 dollars..it was 11 pages long with 8 references..i sent him the first 2 pages and boom he outta there!<br /><br />well jesusjoints just split on me...i sent him some of the paper and he was then going to give me a down payment be4 i gave it all to him...<br /><br />o well..god luck jesusjoints your going to have to really eat your Wheaties to get a grade 6 without me.<br /><br />I mean AS SOON as i sent the mother fucker the paper he was offline, like a bolt of lightning lmao<br /><br />i think i pissed him off by calling him steve irwin people last week who knows..i gotta stop calling any Australian steve irwin lookin people.<br />i also made a few references to the outback steak house but it was legitimate...just having some fun<br /><br />i think he will be back, maybe not..i dont care i got hooked up tonight<br />bummer though im stuck with a well written paper on the Illuminati now...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I AM FUCKING DYING... THE PAPER HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS 3 RING BINDER PAPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />THE LATE (R.I.P.) PERKY...Fuck no rot you lying fucking dirtball <br /><br />HAD 2 SHEETS OF BINDER PAPER STOLEN.... OMG THIS IS THE BEST SCAM I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. <br /><br /><br /><br />That loser fuck stick perky started a thread saying someone stole his 3 ring binder paper!! In all my years I have never heard of or seen this scam. <br /><br />But I can not let this happen again!<br /><br />I told you I was going to clean up the road. And I am going to start tomorrow!<br /><br />I am offering 1 btc for the first 10 non newbie member&#039;s who post on this thread to be MARSHALS on KINGS <br />TASK FORCE FOR STOPPING 3 RING BINDER THIEF&#039;S.<br /><br />Yes this is a job. <br /><br />Tomorrow as you are purchasing your goodies for 4/20 I want you on the look out for any 3 ring binder paper thief&#039;s! <br /><br />The job pays 1 BTC. <br /><br />You will only be a KING MARSHAL for 1 day but I believe with the 10 of you and myself we can make sure on 4/20 NO ONE and I mean NO ONE steals 3 ring binder paper!<br /><br />Now if you choose to use this in my little store I will triple the value and give you 3 BTC value KING KOIN&#039;S.<br /><br />And KING COINS are ALWAYS worth $2.00 more then the BTC!!!<br /><br />You of course do not need to use it with me. <br /><br />I would suggest if you don&#039;t use it with me then go to seller VICODIN and use it there. You will only need 25 more BTC and you could buy yourself at least 1 pill. <br /><br />But who knows? With his kindness and generosity he might be offering half pills tomorrow! So you might get double lucky. ;D<br /><br />I just ask that you please .....and I mean please .....make sure NO ONE gets 1 piece of paper stolen tomorrow.<br /><br />So here is the bottom line:<br /><br />Agree to watch out for paper thief&#039;s tomorrow and I give you 1 BTC.&nbsp; Use however you want.<br /><br />You in turn become a KING MARSHAL for the day and watch with your eye&#039;s wide open that no one steal&#039;s any paper.<br /><br />If you use your coin to make a purchase in my little store... I convert it to 3 KING KOINS!<br /><br />KING KOINS are always worth $2.00 more then the BTC.<br /><br />Its that simple. But you must be at least a jr member. No newbie could possibly catch a paper thief on SR.<br /><br />So the first 10 people that want to try and make sure no paper gets stolen tomorrow. Respond. <br /><br />Thank You<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;KING: Cleaning all the trash off the road ....one piece at a time!&quot;<br /><br /><br />RxKing&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a901074cb3<br />

				This is, without a doubt, the best OP I have ever read.<br /><br />Also, do I count? I&#039;m sorta new to the road, but have spent over 50btc, and never sleep. So I could patrol the forums and listings no stop, making sure no notebook theives are making trouble.<br /><br /><br />I lied. My apologies. 45btc, not 50. Just checked.<br /><br />

I will be keeping my eye on you!&nbsp; 3 KING KOINS for you!<br /><br /><br />Thank you all for taking the night shift! It is important you marshals watch the road for any potential paper&nbsp; thief&#039;s on this shift. We will never know WHEN that fucking lowlife,scum bucket, thumb dick, asshole face motherfucking lying cunt PERKY got his paper&#039;s stolen. Since he is DEAD! <br /><br />But let us not forget it was 2 sheets!<br /><br />Thanks men (and woman) for keeping the road litter free in the wee hours in AFK (After KING) time. <br /><br />I have a strange feeling the papers were stolen sometime around now.... because PERKY was very bright. And I am sure they attacked him when he was very tired. <br /><br />You know from ....<br /><br />FUCKING BEGGING FOR SAMPLES AND THINKING EVERY 3rd MEMBER IS LE AND EVERY VENDOR THAT DIDN&#039;T SUPPLY HIM WITH FREE SAMPLES WAS A SCAMMER... SO HE SPENT MANY HOURS BEING A PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT AND SPREADING FUCKING LIES!!<br /><br />So thank you! Your days pay will be in your accounts soon! <br /><br />And Buster this is NO JOKE ;) WE MUST STOP PAPER SCAMMERS ON HERE!!! <br /><br />&quot;KING: Cleaning the road one day at a time!&quot;<br /><br />thank you<br /><br />RxKing<br />

				The whole thread where they discussed everything, I was pretty much every 2nd post, I knew a scam was taking place but I wasn&#039;t going to shout it out in-case I was wrong. So it started off I thought perky was going to get scammed, then I saw Jesus post hell sensitive information about the paper he wanted written, linking straight to a university page. And Jesusjoint just stopped talking for ages, and perky was waiting for Jesus to come back online so he could &quot;seal the deal&quot; and I was also watching the thread like a hawk, because it was interesting.. And then I never heard of it again till now.<br /><br />I guess now i figured out what happened in the end.<br />Shit that was a terrible explanation, my thoughts are very scattered right now I can&#039;t think straight :P<br /><br />But yeah, I&#039;m not involved with any scamming or anything, I&#039;m merely a buyer waiting on a package to arrive.. which is 17 days in now :(

I knew you weren&#039;t involved. My Marshall&#039;s and I figured out real quick what was going on. We patrolled the site on 4/20 and I am happy to report ...WE found out that &quot;Jesus&quot; was dead!<br /><br />Yes you heard that right. &quot;JESUS&quot; was dead!!! Let me explain:<br /><br />After reading about&nbsp; this tragedy ... of PERKY getting scammed....I spent hours scouring thru 1000&#039;s of post to see who started this scam. I just had to get to the bottom of this. Even though PERKY was dead. I needed to make sure no others were going to get there paper ripped off by the &quot;Jesus&quot; fellow. So I had to find out more. So I did my research....<br /><br />What I found is that this &quot;Jesus&quot; guy has been around forever! <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t believe how long this guy has been around for. Way before Silk Road started this &quot;guy&quot; was causing trouble. And one time he was in so much trouble he even faked his own death. Yes that&#039;s right this &quot;Jesus&quot; fellow even faked his own death! <br /><br />The length these scammers will go to to get out of a scam in unreal. Whats even more suspicious is he faked his own death...yep you guessed it ...right around 4/20! I couldn&#039;t find the year. But when I heard it was around 4/20 I knew I had to dig deeper! <br /><br />They have a big meeting every year to try and find this guy. <br /><br />All these people that have been lied too and scammed by &quot;Jesus&quot; meet and discuss him. Some extremist even meet once a week. <br /><br />But most I found only go once a year.<br /><br />&nbsp;And they do that because their parents made them when they were younger (more on that later!) <br /><br />Yes this sicko even go&#039;s after kids!! And I guess some guy&#039;s in this group that &quot;worship&quot; this fucking liar even go around and rape little boy&#039;s. But don&#039;t you worry.... the KING found a secret way to see who they are..<br /><br />SHHHH!!!&nbsp; (I have to type this lightly...I am not supposed to tell anyone this..But because we are on tor...and everyone knows there is no possible way I can get in trouble in here. I will tell you&nbsp; the&nbsp; secret way to spot these guy.....ill whisper...they wear black rings around there collar. Yep those weird looking fuckers that wear those black rings around their collar....they like little boys! And it&#039;s not just in America. It is the whole world. I think one of these naughty men fucked PERKY when he was 24yo ....so that is why he is so angry and mad at the world. Just a guess...) back to my story....<br /><br />So I did what every expert investigator does (now I usually don&#039;t give away my secrets but since we are on tor I believe I am safe) I searched GOOGLE<br /><br />And you wouldn&#039;t believe all the SCAMS this &quot;Jesus&quot; has been up to.<br /><br />&nbsp;You won&#039;t even believe what I am about to say.... but I swear he pulled these scams off... <br /><br />He got people to believe he walked on water(lol)... <br /><br />He got people to believe he can feed 1000&#039;s with one fish(unreal) YES ONE FUCKING FISH!<br /><br />He even got his mom in on a scam.... and this one has worked on millions of people...<br /><br />He got people to believe his mom was a virgin!!! (I have heard it all). Now I can&#039;t figure out&nbsp; why he did this.... but I think his father had something to do with it.(more on this later)<br /><br />Now in that last scam..... he had a bunch of other SCAMMERS in on it. I think even his &quot;real&quot; dad told people. <br /><br />Or left a note for them....<br /><br />I really can&#039;t figure anything out about his father. I GOOGLED him too ...but nothing came back( GOOGLE knows everything so when I couldn&#039;t find his dad&#039;s name anywhere ...I gave up) :( I dare you to try just 1 thing about this man. He has no name. No pictures. He has been around forever...yet I couldnt find one person that &quot;knew&quot; him. All these crazy people told me they talked to him every nite...(we know they are from the road... a few told me they went here:http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6694953a91)<br /><br />Now this &quot;Jesus&quot; is good. <br /><br />I guess someone sent him money one time with WU ....and the security question was. &quot;<br /><br />What city were you born in?&quot;<br />&nbsp;The answer he put was BETHLEHEM!<br /><br />&nbsp;Can you believe that??. With a city that does not even exist!! I used GOOGLE earth...NOTHING:(<br /><br />This guy just does not stop!! ....I knew I had to dig deeper....<br /><br />So I looked for other &quot;papers&quot; he may have stolen. It&#039;s kind of strange ....he doesn&#039;t really write anything...<br /><br />That&#039;s why he contacted PERKY. <br /><br />You see he.... has a lot of other&nbsp; scammers that write for him. <br /><br />THAT IS WHY HE STEALS PAPER!<br /><br />His friends need it. <br /><br />And I guess they need a lot. <br /><br />They wrote some book called &quot;Bible&quot; and it is really long. (longer then even my post...can you believe it)<br /><br />&nbsp;I figured they were going to make copies of this book and that&#039;s why they needed the paper. It was all making sense to me now...<br /><br />This &quot;Jesus&quot; has 12 scamming friends too!!!...... and they write about him. <br /><br />Now these guys are so good .....NO ONE and I mean NO ONE ......has thier last names. <br /><br />Like PERKY they just have one name too. NO LAST NAMES! Harder to catch!<br /><br />But they used common names .....like John, Paul, Peter ect.. to blend in. <br /><br />I think that&#039;s why &quot;Jesus&quot; wanted PERKY to write for him. He needed a name that would stick. <br />That people would remember. <br /><br />And from the little information I was able to gather about these guy&#039;s..... they all write TOTAL LIES. You wouldn&#039;t BELIEVE the things they wrote.<br /><br />So PERKY would be perfect for this group and his followers. ...<br /><br />You see..... PERKY only writes lies and non truths. And I guess these 12 are known for spreading more lies then even PERKY!!! <br /><br />I know,.... I know .....your saying... <br /><br />&quot;King it is possible these 12 guys spread more lies then PERKY, it just can&#039;t be true? But I assure you ....from my investigating.... these 12 men have told more bullshit to more people then even PERKY has. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t believe it at first either. But I guess that book they wrote has a bunch of stories that even PERKY couldn&#039;t come up with.<br /><br />So I moved on to hunt down this &quot;Jesus&quot; guy. ....<br /><br />Everyone I talked to was looking for him. <br /><br />But it was strange... They weren&#039;t mad at him. ... they just wanted to see him one more time. Almost like they were begging for him to come back. This fucker must have really scammed a lot of people! <br /><br />He didn&#039;t get just our dear pal PERKY. This fucker ....it seems got half the world! <br />Yes I said world! Unreal. It seems like they were praying for &quot;Jesus&quot; to come back.<br /><br />Some even hold a meeting every Sunday to look for him... or something ....I am not sure.. I just know they meet. It&#039;s strange though... in my research the Hispanic people really didn&#039;t seem to be affected by him. It was almost spooky how everyone of them.... loves this guy. They light candles for him .....and have his wanted poster.....or some form of picture on there walls and stuff. <br /><br />It was strange..<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyways they even claim to see him in toast, in pancakes, in well... Just about anything! This guy is really good.<br /><br />&nbsp;So PERKY shouldn&#039;t be to mad &quot;Jesus&quot; stole from him. This guy lied to millions of people.<br /><br />And his &quot;friends&quot; or the code word they used &quot;disciples&quot; really fucked people over. I guess they would just follow this scammer around and write down every move he made. I really didn&#039;t get it.<br /><br />&nbsp;All I know is that PERKY was not alone. Ohhh no..... This guy fucked millions.<br /><br />I am still on this case and trying to find out more. I will update you when I figure it all out. <br /><br />But I guess people have been trying to do this forever. <br /><br />But rest assured the KING will get to the bottom of this...<br /><br />Because we have all learned one thing in here... The KING always gets his man...<br /><br />I will be back...<br /><br />RxKing

But I kept this going g because I was asked to. And for the record I think it is really funny. Could have made it cleaner and more precise but to come up with material that follows the real names of the scammers involved and type sarcastic on the fly is not the easiest.<br /><br />And I am not a comedian. AT ALL. I just couldn&#039;t believe the guy who got perkys paper was named Jesus. I still can&#039;t believe there was a paper. I can&#039;t believe any of this.<br /><br />But when I read the first post I die. I was really reading about scammers and the scamming list and couldn&#039;t believe my eyes when my pal perky showed up..ACTUALLY CLAIMING HE GOT SCAMMED!<br /><br />Not only that... but he actually said 2 pieces of paper were stolen and the thief was Jesus! Now if you cant find that funny... you just have zero sense of humor.<br /><br />Whats even better is that this PERKY is a senior member ...has not told one truth... has been caught in 10 lies. And he is allowed to stay in here and post away. PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT!<br /><br />You can hate my character in here. I promise it is just that... but you can not call me a scammer a crook a thief a bad vendor noting like that. And I have only attacked those that have lied.<br /><br />I even get how some people hate my long post and everything else I do. That&#039;s what&#039;s great.... They still read it. I have actually had a pm saying I am to arragant. LOL I only play that KING shit in my own post! How can I be anything in my own post?<br /><br />Find just one customer that had a bad experience with me? 90% of the other vendors dont&nbsp; even&nbsp; talk to there buyers. read that again. DON&#039;T EVEN TALK TO THERE BUYERS.<br /><br />And I have seen post where others stick up for the vendor!! UNREAL. and I am not talking about vendors that post I am talking about a guy buys something and a week later the vendor ignores the question. And like I said more then a few took the vendors side...unreal<br /><br />Also all that should matter is buying and selling in here at the end of the day. But there are guys that are just miserable and hate there life and are mad at the world and you can tell. Again all I care about is selling what I have and giving the buyer the best buying experience I can. If I say something funny Great. If I say something yo don&#039;t find funny...maybe even better;) at the end of the day.... I just want perky dead(lol) and my package to arrive. And it be the right package!<br /><br />Sorry for not hitting a home run. <br /><br />I guess what I need to do is beg for samples, accuse 5 people a day of being LE. Attack any vendor that is new and call him a scammer or reverse scammer. Create 9 names. Borrow btc. Go into someones post that I know nothing about and complain because they sound to full of themselves. Pm a mod and tell on someone for calling me stupid. Think that any day now SR is going to be raided by the FBI. Tell a story how I went to my mail house in costume because you can never be to safe.. watched my box for 5 hours...you never know...then went to go open it but I noticed 2 red cars in the parking lot and I read that LE only uses red cars to catch drug buyers. No its true! That&#039;s how they took down hidden wiki. Make a post how congress is going to take away our right to use tor. Make another one that USPS is stopping service next week because they are bankrupt.<br /><br />I think I read all those today. Should I have used a PGP to post that. You know... In case the DEA takes over the server... I wouldn&#039;t want them to have my screen name. If I do that. And I kiss ass then I will have no problems.<br /><br />Sounds great!<br /><br /><br />YEAAAAAAA!

				See now that last part is pretty damn funny! That&#039;s how SR operates on some degree so one of those funny cause it&#039;s true types... and I&#039;m gonna totally keep an eye out for the red cars thanks ;) But your also right on that SR operates with good members sticking up for the good vendors. That&#039;s what it should be going on across the boards. Honest and 100% open communication will make this place hum with successful transactions and hopefully help rid the scammers.<br /><br />I definitely thought the whole perky thing was funny. That guy is something else (more on that later) and definitely missing some brain cells me thinks. As he unfortunately had such a terrible experience with the jesus, it was laughable. Like ha ha funny. The joke writes itself, the guys name was jesus, and then there&#039;s that other dood named jesus and lets connect those dots and go on and on about it for 12 spinoff jokes too many. Jay Leno style know what I&#039;m sayin? I just wanted to express my honest criticism as I have enjoyed most of your posts, nothing beats good entertainment right, and wanted to help you hone the character you could say. Just my 2 bit cents chief. And when I place an order soon I&#039;m sure the pills will be good-- love those yellow bars.<br /><br />Back to perky, that ass face piece of shit rat bastard is such a low life scamming insignificunt I would like to have him eliminated as well. See I notice in his blanket spam posts in every board making a thread about needing a 3 and a half bitcoin loan for yaddada blah blah bleh. He said to send it to FreeLife1. Now, FreeLife1 is a proven low life scamming insignificunt that&#039;s been caught and banned out of here, just not his name on SR it appears. how many fucking names does he have?? He got me for $150 in a moneypak exchange gone south when I first became a member and really new to the dark net as a whole like 4 months ago. He took a lot of people and worked with another known insignificunt king joey aka doublemint at the time. They posted a bunch on shill accounts, this was before karma was around and people went be other&#039;s post counts as a gauge of their legitness. Lame I know, but this also gives you background on why we have the karma feature that we have now. And why an assclown like perky has so many posts. Anyway long story short fuck that guy.<br /><br />Back to your originally schedule programming... while I smoke more heroin off foil and browse these forums... feels like a friday night!
