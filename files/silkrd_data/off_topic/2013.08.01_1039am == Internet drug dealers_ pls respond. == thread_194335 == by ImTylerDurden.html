				I really enjoy reading these forums, as they are informative and humourous. And then it struck me. These internet dealers do not come off as stereotypical drug lords.&nbsp; You all appear to be organized, well mannered, funny, intelligent, genuinely good people, etc.&nbsp; Its like a dream. Drug dealers that dont go full retard 70% of the time. It is just too good to be true. But is this just a front? Are you guys just the people getting paid to do all the transactions on the computer while the actual dealers are in the trenches? Are you guys actually cold blooded killers like people from the Mexican Cartel? Do you return phone calls? Do you actually show up in 15 minutes when you say you will? obviously you guys slang a lot of volume so a lot of you never even have a chance to be an hour late to meet customers. Everyone that I know IRL that sells drugs (other than weed), is usually a life fuck up &gt;&gt; no formal education past the 9th grade, no real job, in and out of jail every 6 months, 3 kids by the age of 22, beating the shit out of the baby momma, heroine addict, etc. It is cool and weird to me at the same time to think a lot of you are like me, in that you have a normal functioning life, except you just slang large amounts of drugs instead of going to a 9 to 5, five days a week. <br /><br />Im not asking for details. But I am curious if you SR dealers consider yourself to be normal citizens. Mainly I just have no idea how people that do not come off as gangbangers or drug addicts can manage to even get a connection on huge quantities of drugs. Why are you guys only on the internet? Why the fuck arent you the guy that I have to deal with in person? The street needs more intelligent drug dealers. You guys should teach classes or something.<br /><br />I will endlessly bump this thread until it gets attention. Also, Jack n Hoff must respond to this since I know he is awake right now and reads every post on the forum.<br /><br />TL;DR: Read it anyway you pussy.<br /><br />Also, accepting Karma for asking the question that everyone on Silk Road has pondered at some point.<br /><br />Tymen<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d consider myself to be a nice person anyway, but selling outside if Silk Road often required you to be aggressive to chase money owed, etc.<br />I rarely resort to this, but sometimes it&#039;s necessary. On Silk Road, money stays in escrow so there is no need for that.

				Exactly the same as you mate, I&#039;m a normal guy with a normal life. Me and my business partner got in money troubles two years back because of a legit business so we decided to start ordering large amounts of drugs of here on bulk buys and selling to a very loyal friend (we knew he would never tell anyone who or where the drugs came from) <br /><br />He could sell 100g of MDMA in our area for about 5K, we could get it for 1.5k, so we&#039;d sell him it for 2.5K. Did the same with Ket. About 200g of each, each month for about a year while we were fully able to continue running our legit business and get out of money trouble. Sadly, our friend decided enough was enough and moved to another city with a comfy 20k in his back pocket saved over the last two years. <br /><br />So, we thought fuck it we like this drug money, Lets take a shot at vending. And I&#039;m glad we did because so far, so good. I love this place and about 95% of the people here &lt;3

				I am not a drug dealer, but I have known many in my time!<br /><br />And the successful ones aren&#039;t generally the ones with the loud mouths or the guns. The successful ones are businessmen and women, who carry out their trade with integrity and honesty. Occasionally they might have to get aggro for one reason or another mind you. But generally they&#039;re good people.

				How many drug dealers have you personally known who are like that? Are you just regurgitating what you have seen in films and on TV? I have known many people outside of SR who are great to work with and normal intelligent people.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m just an everyday dude, reasonably well-educated (I guess that&#039;s dependent on one&#039;s definition of &quot;well-educated&quot;) with a regular/normal life.<br />Toss in a penchant for internet/security curiosity and desire for learning with a dash of ardent social liberalism, and you&#039;ve got me. More or less.

				I&#039;m not a Vendor on SR, but here&#039;s my 2 cents. I suppose to establish drug dealing on the street at a low level it doesn&#039;t take my brain power, time or business acumen, you can be late, sell things off weight because you get your cash straight away.<br /><br />However on the road you need some understanding of business &amp; professionalism, and also because money is kept in Escrow cash isn&#039;t straight away in your hands. So I believe the feeling you get of the vendors being nice and down to earth people is because they have some understanding of how a proper operation should be run and they also understand the golden rule that the customer should ALWAYS be left feeling happy and satisfied, thanks to the rating system and forums. Where as street dealers can take cash and dash, personally I think it&#039;s wonderful that we have got a fairly well developed community of vendors and customers on the road that can work in harmony to provide quality products with top service for decent prices.<br /><br />Regards<br />PlanB :)

				The Silk Road takes the violence out of the game, because it uses Tor anonymity. <br /><br />Thus, the added personal safety tends to draw in the more civilized individuals who would not normally have the know-how, or the connects to make a functional business for themselves.&nbsp; This site, and sites like it, allow the regular Joe &quot;nice guy&quot; to become a regular Suburban-hero.&nbsp; Providing all of the very best drugs, from all over the world, without ever leaving his living room! <br /><br />But the Silk Road&#039;s measly 35 Million Dollars in annual sales PALE in comparison to the 400 Billion Dollars of annual revenue in the real-world &#039;Black Market&#039;, which is still very much alive and kickin&#039; ...<br /><br />We can only hope for the growth of the Silk Road and sites like it.&nbsp; The War on Drugs is what makes the Game so violent in the first place... Silk Road is actually one of the biggest steps, Globally, in reducing that violence.<br /><br />And for that, DPR, we commend you.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Fair enough Praetorian, sure those elements exist, but that does not make it necessary to get to know those people. I spent plenty of time in the game and completely avoided the world of guns and violence. Even when business problems came up in my circles they were dealt with and life went on. Everybody treated each other with love and respect. Those who did not were excluded and pushed out of the team. Perhaps my experience is different and I have been fortunate. But when you are working with violent people that is a choice and it is not one I would make.

				Howard &quot;Mr Nice&quot; Marks is one of the best known international drug dealers of the last 50 years. He comes across as a pretty decent guy who cares deeply for his family and friends, and he has a lovely sense of humor.
