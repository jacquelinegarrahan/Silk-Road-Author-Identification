				So, last night I went to pick up a g, really regretting it now, as for the price I paid Â£10 a point, it was some of the worst stuff I have EVER had in my life, and to add insult to injury...<br /><br />The guy wanted to meet me in Tesco Car Park, right in front of a FUCKING SECURITY CAMERA, I asked him are there any cameras there, and he said yeah I&#039;m right in front of one! Unbelievable.<br /><br />Last weekend, another guy just drove up next to my car, in the middle residential street and chucked a couple of g&#039;s straight through my window, dumbass was so off his tits he couldn&#039;t be bothered to get out of his car to do his own deal, with no consideration or care for what or who might be around.<br /><br />Is it just me, or how dumb have IRL dealers become?<br /><br />I&#039;m sticking to SR from now on, no more streets for me and shit that comes with it! lol! THANK GOODNESS FOR SR!!! &lt;/endofrant&gt; :)

				Ugh, I&#039;ve understood that the IRL dealers are a bit off their game, yes.. It&#039;s utterly unforgivable when one is buying and the &quot;vendor&quot; says to meet in front of the police depot, like WTF is one supposed to get a free arrest with every 5th purchase?? Or the lack of knowledge of the weed they offer, they can&#039;t even tell if one if it&#039;s indoor/outdoor grown... Well as one might believe, I for one find SR the perfect solution for my needs. <br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Now that I&#039;ve been on SR for awhile my tolerance for IRL bullshit has gone down drastically. I never realized what utter stupidity and bs I used to put up with, now knowing it was not necessary. <br /><br />So maybe they were always that dumb irl but now that you are used to the road you are noticing it more!

				I can get some fairly good herb irl, good enough to be sold on here but when i mention this to these people they treat it like witchcraft, seriously when i showed them the site they were reaching for flaming torches and pitchforks.<br />I always arrange the drop points, no way am i allowing some other fucker to arrange a pick up at tesco with le sitting in a car waiting to knock me, complete with cctv music vid.

				its because they are low life mofos with no clue what business they are into. i am pretty glad to see more serious stuff going on on SR. even though even trusted sellers disappear with FE&#039;d money (i know its the buyers fault bla..) it&#039;s still a lot more convenient than what i ever saw in the towns and cities ..

				My weed dealer is awesome. He vacuum seals it and he tells me the strain. He always knows whether it&#039;s indica, sativa or hybrid. He&#039;ll also give me a short review of how it feels. Sometimes he even asks for feedback.<br /><br />I had a cool MDMA (caps) dealer that gave me free doses and told me to fuck bitches on &quot;ecstasy&quot;. This same guy also told me not to do opiates, and only sold them to people who are already addicted.

				Depends on a lot of things. What substance they sell, are they constantly using it, etc.<br /><br />I had half a dozen heroin dealers. One was a prick who always cut his shit and was always fucked up. However, his security was surprisingly good. Kept the shit in his mouth (up until the exchange...ugh) to swallow if the popo came around, always did deals away from prying eyes, and had strict phone rules. On the flip side, another one of my dealers was one of the nicest women I ever met, and went out of her way to make sure I was satisfied with her product. She even offered to drive me somewhere after I had taken buses all day when my wallet (and license) was stolen. Unfortunately, her security was terribad. Did deals out in fairly crowded places without being terribly discrete, texted things you really shouldn&#039;t text, etc. Everyone&#039;s different.<br /><br />I&#039;ve considered starting using again, and I would definitely be going through SR if there are any domestic options. Why get stuff that&#039;s cut to shit or risk getting caught when you can avoid all that?<br /><br />

				honestly ive found things to be pretty similar IRL as on the Sr<br /><br />some street vendors i know are legit, security concious, and have excellent product. some were piece of shit junkies, didnt give a fuck bout security, had awful product. and there were combinations of the above 2. some were security smart but had bad product and service. some were extremely nice but made bad product decisions/security, etc.... and the same seems to go on here, albeit in different ways

				Like a lot of you here I love having the endless choice SR provides. I don&#039;t have to stick to one type of coke, or one type of weed, or one type of whatever I fancy! The SR Drugs Supermarket is fantastic, it&#039;s like being like a kid in a sweet shop, for the first time all over again, but better! :D<br /><br />My IRL bud dealer hasn&#039;t got a clue, he just refers to everything as &#039;Blue Cheese&#039;, even though once he sold &#039;Thai Stick&#039; to me as &#039;Blue Cheese&#039;, and didn&#039;t hold back on those bloody sticks either lol! Even funnier, he&#039;s never actually sold me &#039;Blue Cheese&#039;, I think if &#039;Blue Cheese&#039; smacked him in the face, he&#039;d still be clueless LOL! I should really ask him do you know what a strain is, just for the laugh! He&#039;s not even young, he&#039;s in his 30&#039;s, so should know better! Â£10, for a .8 of that crap, was a bit of a pisstake though! But when your desperate your desperate, and I&#039;m sure that there&#039;s plenty here to relate to that!<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to know I&#039;m not alone! Thank-you guys for cheering me up! :)

				Just don&#039;t deal with people like that.&nbsp; They will get you in trouble one day.&nbsp; Another reason I would choose to wait a few days over through mail than going to meet someone and getting product right away.&nbsp; No matter how pro they are I never feel safe since I still have to drive back and there are eyes everywhere.

				Weirdly enough, i actually feel less safe with stuff being mailed to me. The only reason I do it on SR is because i can&#039;t get it IRL. The IRL guys I do know are fairly professional. I&#039;ve always liked people who only deal with a small list of clientelle. They don&#039;t get too big, they pretty much know what you want so you don&#039;t have to tell them much, and the meets are fairly secure.<br /><br />Though, i&#039;m not paranoid about meets in public places either (grocery store parking lots). It&#039;s when public places arent busy (late at night) when I would get paranoid. I&#039;d hate to be the only car there, waiting for one other car to pull up. Atleast at a grocery store, cars are pulling in and out all the time. People are going about their business, not paying attention to you.Regardless, never good to make a habit of it either.

				I have a couple good connects IRL. They are safe, communicate, and know what they&#039;re about. Sadly, they&#039; have been dry on what I favor for months.<br /><br />My choices were limited, so here I am. Much safer than looking around for a new dealer that will most likely just give me headaches. It just isn&#039;t worth the effort.<br /><br />Besides, how often can you get written recommendations about the dealer you have to trust?

I hate liars anyway. When it comes to high risk business, it&#039;s very important to exercise caution at all times. <br /><br />Once I&#039;m more established here, I&#039;ll be happy to have a private chat with you, as I believe these things should be kept in private. You have the highest post count on any forum I have ever seen, so I&#039;m sure you can be trusted? lol!&nbsp; ;)
