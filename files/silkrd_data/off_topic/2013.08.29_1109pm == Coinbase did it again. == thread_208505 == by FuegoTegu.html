				This is the second time I&#039;ve gotten a return fee for insufficient funds because of Coinbase. I have evidence that shows I have more than enough money in my bank account. I paid the amount for the bitcoins, never received the bitcoins, and I have another $30 return fee.<br /><br />It&#039;s clear they are gambling their customers money by buying bitcoins with it in order to raise the value.<br /><br />I&#039;ve waited weeks and weeks, for them to fuck me once again. Don&#039;t worry, my lawyer is well aware. What they&#039;re doing is against their contract and very illegal.

				They&#039;re just doing an ACH transfer. If that fails it means your bank rejected it; I don&#039;t really see how that is coinbase&#039;s fault.

				Coinbase has a very good reputation, they are who I have used consistently with positive results. The one and only time they bounced my account was when I was late making a deposit, but I have overdraft protection, no biggie.

				Dude FUCK coinbase! First time I tried to get BTc I had to wait a week, got my order cancelled, and had to email them 3 times. I went to Virwox instead. Some really cool shit happened though were I spent the money I was gonna use for coinbase after I email coinbase. They thought I was still tryna get btc from them and manually reviewed the transaction and gave me .21 btc AFTER I had already spent that money on virwox. So they suck ass but they fuck up in the right areas sometimes I guess lol
