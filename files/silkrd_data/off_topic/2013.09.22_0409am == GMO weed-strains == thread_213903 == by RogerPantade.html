				I smoked that OG kush a couple of months ago and it was a unpleasant high that I am kinda unfamiliar with, it was kinda foggy in my mind like I did not get high, I became like a zombie and not in a good way..<br /><br />And I also see people writing online about &quot;kush-zombies&quot;..<br /><br />that OG kush does not even smell like that good weed it almost smells like something that was made in a lab, like some weird chemicals.<br /><br /><br />I also tasted some Sour Kush andthat a kush crossed with a skunk or something Im not really shure, but that one smelled better and the high was okey but still kinda weird.<br /><br />So what strains are GMO strains since I know real growers, and smokers probably smell, taste and feel the difference betwen GMO-strains and natural strains?<br /><br />Can we write a list of the GMO-strains or is them well hidden in the normal natural strains?<br /><br />Kush is GMo right?<br /><br />When did Kush &quot;hit the market&quot;? <br /><br />I was a grower myself in the past and I grew some strains that smelled like weed should smell and I always felt like that sweet smell is so wonderfull because its programmed into our minds that we should feel that it is a beautiful smell when we smell it.<br /><br />Have anyone else felt this was about a strain? kush?<br /><br />Like youre not getting high or stones youre just getting zombielike and your thought dont get stimulated by the weed like normal weed makes your thought roam freely while that kush bullshit made my thoughts stop basicly. Anyone know what im talkin bout?<br /><br />Its like smokin frankenstein I guess, manmade weedDNA not made by the most high and nature..
