				So does anyone have any idea how many members on SR and what sort of $$ goes through?<br /><br />I know I&#039;ve put through my fair share&nbsp; ;)

				The site has been specifically set up so you cannot figure those numbers out which is a good thing. At one time you could find out how many members had signed up but they recently changed that along with how order numbers are assigned so it is impossible to find out this info which is a good thing.

				Yes, you won&#039;t get anything other than estimates from the SR admins, and I doubt you&#039;d get that. If SR is to survive, this kind of info can&#039;t go public. There are very advanced data-analysis techniques/algorithms and you&#039;d be surprised at the sort of info that can be gleaned.<br /><br />LE are no doubt trying to build a model of SR and exactly how it functions, and to see it in its biggest picture. Hopefully there are such precautions in place that these kind of details will always remain opaque.<br /><br />But I&#039;d estimate anywhere from 300,000 members with 100,000 of those being actual buyers. And judging by the amount of prizes given out for 4/20.. that 10% commission seems to be paying the bills/server/japanese supermodel escort service costs all too well.
