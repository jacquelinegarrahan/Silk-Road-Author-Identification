				seriously considering attempting to do something like start taking out surveillance/speed/red light cameras.&nbsp; i know it will come out of taxpayer pockets in the long run, but combined with a PR campaign to get the public support behind it, maybe it could make a positive difference?&nbsp; thinking along the lines of documenting the acts and sending the video to local media with some kind of manifesto.&nbsp; thoughts and suggestions appreciated.

				Go for it. I have no problem with red light cameras in principal.<br /><br />I hate the idea that they are ran by private companies, which profit off of enforcement of public law. <br /><br />I, however, would never vote guilty if I were on a jury and the defendant was fucking up those things. Just be careful. Best bet is to not get caught. Only way I can think of doing that is a long range shot with a rifle, and there is a good chance you could miss and hit something you would rather not hit.

				Also, if you are good with a shotgun, a slow drive by one of them at night (early morning) would likely do the trick. Deer slug would fuck one of those things up!

				Attach a huge magnet to them so the picture is blurred, or attach infared lights above your license plate so it blocks out the picture and speed through them over and over fingering the camera lol

Would be hard to reach them without a ladder. That is why I focused on projectile weaponry. <br /><br />Or, you could weld some solid steel bumpers on the front of a big ass truck and run the fuckers over.
