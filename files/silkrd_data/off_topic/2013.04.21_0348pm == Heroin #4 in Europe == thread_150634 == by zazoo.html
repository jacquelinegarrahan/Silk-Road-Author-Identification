				Why is heroin #4 so prevalent in NE US, but (in my experience) very rare in the UK.&nbsp; From my understanding, it is also generally not as big as #3 across all of Europe and seems just as rare as it is in the UK, possibly with the exception of the Netherlands. <br /><br />If it can be trafficked to the US, why is it not trafficked to Europe where it could reach by land and sold there? I have tried researching on the internet but there isn&#039;t as much information as I was hoping and thought the collective SR knowledge could help me.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Who knows?! The less refined product is saved for europeans? Less of a stigma to sell something intended to be smoked? I thought I had more guesses but that&#039;s it ^.^ <br /><br />PS I&#039;m 1.7 btc short of a 5gram #4 order from SAW, want to kick in and get 2btc back or a proportionate amount of the goods?

				Could have to do something with the D.E.A.<br /><br />The are heavely involved in the golden triangle.<br /><br />Myanmar Thailand and Laos.<br /><br />Warlords with their own very strickt soldiers.<br />&nbsp;Those who are garding the poppyfields will be shot when they use the drug they make.<br /><br />When the warlords were delivered on a silver plate to the D.E.A, they were not interested.<br />And when you play that high the warlords make it seem to cooperate with the dea, but play a double game with the D.E.A.<br /><br />The policy seems to be, we can not stop the drugflow anyway, so let us be supplied at least by our friends.<br /><br />The warlords want to stay in position, so competition is kept short and sold out the the D.E.A.<br /><br />A left over from the time the Vietcong kicked the Americans out of Vietnam, if you ask me.<br /><br />Heroin came to the Dutch market the first tome in the summer of 1972.<br /><br />If I remember it wel to make some money for a south Chinese warlord (Chinese rocks)<br /><br />The U.S. was the cat cornered and needed friends, so the cat made some strange moves.<br /><br /><br />Number 4 is mostly from south east Asia.<br /><br />My answer is not wikiproof, I don&#039;t have sources so can not quote.<br />My guess is not that far off, that I do know.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same everywhere and every time.<br /><br />Like the warlord Dustung from Uzbekistan.<br />He did not get all those Russian tanks for free .<br /><br />The KGB/fsb told before Afghanistahn and the taliban, that Dustung was a heroin trafficker.<br />At least one delivery was tailed from St Petersburg to Spain.<br /><br />But Stalin was a dodgy friend and allied friend too.<br />Sometimes you just can not be to picky about who to chose as a friend
