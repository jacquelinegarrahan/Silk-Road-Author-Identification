				i bet you were one of those kids who used to rile the shit out of the &#039;big boys&#039; until they punch you for being a dick. of course then you go running off to your mum or a teacher, screaming and crying about the injustice of it all and demanding action be taken.

				You all are a bunch of fucking racist dickheads. It&#039;s hilarious what you little pussy willows are willing to say in the privacy of anonymous forum. You fucking twathating, cuntbag, little willy pricks wouldn&#039;t dare have any type of this conversation in front of a grown black man in the present day.

				Can i 1 karma you kennypowders? Seriously, just became a jr member and like what you said. I too am not a racist(hateful), just a bigot(stereo-typer). Not that being a bigot is much better, but it was all in joking and i was feeling a little comedic towards the threads ridiculous title.

				NorthernStar, just take a teaspoon of cement and harden the fuck up. No one cares about your problem/obsession with bruce, so stop spamming the forum with meaningless inflammatory shit to get attention. That&#039;s all. :)
