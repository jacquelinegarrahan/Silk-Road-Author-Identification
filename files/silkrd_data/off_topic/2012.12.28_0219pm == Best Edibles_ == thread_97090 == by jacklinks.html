				US or where you want them shipped?<br /><br />if you are good with cooking just buy some good hash or trimmings from organic growers or buy some hash butter.<br />you can basically cook everything you want, you just have to make sure you stay below 180 or 185Â°C, as cannabinoids evaporate on higher temps. and ofc you want all the cannabutter inside your meal, so a steak is not the best you could choose, but you could mix some cannabutter with other spices and herbs and put it on top of the steak after cooking. <br /><br />i still think that if you make some good brownies yourself and put some ice cream on it while they are still hot is one of the best hashfoods ever.<br />i have seen people crying on shrooms when they ate my brownies with ice cream and hot raspberries. Can add some vanilla sauce if its not good enough yet. they said it was the best meal they have ever eaten. one stopped eating after one spoon and refused to eat for some minutes as he said &quot;it fucks my mind so much, its so damn good&quot;.<br />the combination of something hot and cold. something sweet and sour. and on top of that a good amount of THC and co ;).<br /><br />if you are looking for something easy: hot chocolate: put a big pot on your stove and fill it a bit with water, like half full, than put a smaller pot in the bigger pot and let it swim on the water. you want the water to be pretty hot, nearly boiling. than you put butter in the small pot and let it smelt slowly. you dont want the butter to burn.&nbsp; add about 0,2-0,5g hash per cup to the butter and let it completly dissolve in the butter.<br />add milk and cacao powder and finish with a bit cream on top. voila.<br /><br />wait at least 1 hour to drink another cup. depending on how much you have eaten before it can take between 15-90 minutes until you feel the effects. try to slowly reach your limit. better start with low doses.<br /><br />live long &amp; green<br />OJP
