				So I am planning on becoming a weed vendor on SR. When I first start I will only be shipping in Canada and All my weed will be ground up before hand to remove and chance of it being found.<br />The strain im going to be selling is super lemon haze and it is quite a good smoke. I have my med card and have tried quite a few nice strains and I would say that compared to all the other things I have tried I would give this about a 8/10.<br />So anyway what do you guys think would be a reasonable price to charge? everything would be +$15 for express shipping and +5 for normal bubblerap shipping. I was thinking $260 an ounce +shipping, 140+ shipping costs for a Half, $80+ shipping for 7 grams and $50+shipping for a 1/8. Would canadian buyers out their be willing to pay this? price wise its a lot better than other ships the only thing is the weed is pregrinded, not that it really decreased the quality of what your getting.<br /><br />http://www.screenshots.cc/show/67077/ngrzh

				i wouldnt even bother selling if you just plan to grind up the bud.&nbsp; nobody wants to buy a bunch of ground up who knows what...<br /><br />honestly it is not necessary at all, just research safe shipping methods. if you abide by these guidelines nearly every package can successfully slip by undetected.<br /><br />your prices seem reasonable though, you should consider selling to the us though too to expand your customer base.

				All your prices seem competitive, don&#039;t grind up the weed, preferably try to not even compress the buds too much (even for international shipping), order from a couple of top vendors and copy/improve upon their packaging. Start out selling small quantities within escrow to trusted buyers, then after building a rep you can request new buyers to finalize early. Good luck.
