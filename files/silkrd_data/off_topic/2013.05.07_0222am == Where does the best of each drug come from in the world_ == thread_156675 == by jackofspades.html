				To answer the (sort of question) &quot;LE gathering intel really?&quot; - Assuming the &quot;really?&quot; is shorthand for &quot;Are you serious?&quot; <br /><br />Yes, REALLY, for REALZIES, no GIVE BACKSKIES! - I already know your demographic by your lingo. <br /><br />Why not? - Is there a such thing as being &quot;too careful&quot; on here?? <br /><br />Excuse me for being careful.

				Canada, specifically Ontario and British Columbia, are quite prolific producers of high-quality cannabis and MDMA. High-grade cannabis is street-level in the big cities- you can get purple kush for 10 bucks a gram from any 14 year old smoking cigarettes outside a high school. Curiously, street-level hash really sucks here and is mostly treated as a novelty.

				You are all being extremely narrow with this. <br /><br />Cocaine - Peru/Bolivia/Columbia - First isolated/Synthesized by Richard Willstätter in 1898 (there was some minor production in Dutch Indonesia in the first decades of the 20th century)<br /><br />MDMA - Globally. The idea that it all comes from the Netherlands is a crock of shit. Most MDMA in the U.K for example is actually done in clandestine labs within the U.K. The reason why it can be done globally is that there is so many different routes and there is always one that enables you to source all the precursors and reagents within a country legally.<br /><br />Cannabis - Globally. Cannabis is one of the most resilient plants in the world and can grow anywhere (much like the Opium Poppy) but obviously different agricultural conditions will influence quality. Arguably the best naturally grown Cannabis is found in Afghanistan and the best quality of where it&#039;s cultivated is California and British Columbia. <br /><br />Heroin/Opium - Afghanistan, The Golden Triangle, The Golden Crescent, Columbia and Mexico. The only negating factor for this is that the growing conditions in Afghanistan are ideal and thus the best quality comes from there. <br /><br />Meth - Mexico/USA/Australia/South-east Asia. Meth, much like MDMA is easily produced but the only difference is that it&#039;s not caught on universally so it&#039;s nearly always produced in the locality that it&#039;s used in and if it isn&#039;t it&#039;ll be only in a neighboring country (an example of this is the Meth trade between Mexico and the U.S)<br /><br />Amphetamines - Globally. Like MDMA and Meth it&#039;s easy to make clandestinely and there are many ways to make it that allows Amphetamine production to be easily done anywhere. <br /><br />LSD - North America, Northern EU and India. LSD is not dependent on farming like Cocaine or Heroin however you need decent links to get the precursors and skilled chemists to make it so although it can be made anywhere the specialists that do it generally come from those places. <br /><br />Ketamine - India/Mexico. India is still the largest Ketamine producing country in the world despite the law changes however recently it has begun to be produced clandestinely in Mexico instead of importing it from India for the reason stated. <br /><br />Synthetics - China/India. Can be produced cheaply and quickly there because there laws haven&#039;t caught up with the west with only the ones sanctioned by the U.N (2C-B for example) being sanctioned against. <br /><br />Benzodiazepines - India/Pakistan. Most generics are produced there and shipped around the world because of the relaxed laws on this. <br /><br />Steroids - Same as Benzodiazepines. <br /><br />Anymore ask and I shall say.<br /><br />

What qualities lie within &quot;best&quot;? I could see for meth the factor would be purity, since it is a single chemical compund you&#039;re after, and the same would apply to opiates and mdma, basically all of the &quot;powders&quot;. It gets a little tricky when you start talking about plants and plant derivatives where no single chemical is 100% responsible for the effects. Sure, THC gets you high, but it&#039;s pretty well established that there are many, many psychoactive compounds in a bud.<br /><br />I&#039;d say that although meth use is most prevalent in the US, I&#039;d guess the most pure would come from the Netherlands, along with MDMA. I&#039;d guess that Cannabis and its derivatives are probably most potent in the US, not just because of the prevalence, but because of the recent decriminalization in a few states, and the related high demand (no pun intended); and opiates from Afghanistan.&nbsp; Coke, of course is indigenous to the Andes, and doesn&#039;t cultivate as well outside of this region

They even know perfectly where many of the labs/cultivations (of opium/coke etc.) are, it is just that they cannot either remotely enter there (for various reasons, some being for $$$).<br /><br />Saying that a thread like this can serve LE to gather intel would be like saying that posing a question about the Divine Comedy of Dante in Yahoo could be used by some university to elaborate a new thesis.<br /><br />C&#039;mon!

				I think that the quality of any drug produced depends entirely on the skill of the chemist/grower/whatever. <br /><br />&quot;Top buds imported from Canada&quot; means fuck all to me. Some of the best weed I&#039;ve smoked was grown in a converted wardrobe here in the UK. lol
