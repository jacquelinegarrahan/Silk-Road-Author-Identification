				So here&#039;s the dilema. I currently have $460 stuck between dwolla and my bank account. I&#039;m In the process of transfering the money from dwolla back Into my bank account, due to no longer being able to purchase bc and SHIT service on dwolla&#039;s end. After countless back and forth conversations with there &quot;customer support&quot; and my bank, I will not be able to touch my money until monday of next week...MONDAY!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been flipping the M1 I get on SR lately and It&#039;s going better then I could have ever hoped for. I have just enough money to be able to purchase Gonzo&#039;s 100 grams ($518), which Is druglord status for me :/ (Not bad considering I started with 5 gs from another vendor). Problem Is that It&#039;s tied up until fuckin monday! I know the cliche answer Is &quot;just wait&quot; but there Is a major demand for this shit and my phone Is blowing up 24/7 and I feel like I&#039;m going to lose my customers. Without going Into to much detail, I made this plan when I first found Silk Road that after I get to 100 g&#039;s and flip I&#039;ll be able to afford a kilo and I know somebody locally that will buy as many as I can get for 20k a pop and that kind of money Is just not feasible to even think about where I come from.<br /><br />I understand that this Is an absurd ammount of money to think about loaning someone your never gonna meet. But I do have the money to pay you back and will show you plenty of proof to back up my statements. I also have $130 resolution currently &quot;under review&quot; from a package that never arrived and the user has since been banned, so I&#039;m 99% sure that will be In my account tommorow and you can have It the second I&#039;m refunded. Again I&#039;m not trying to scam anybody and I can and will prove this to you If you decide to help me.&nbsp; <br /><br />TL;DR<br />Money Is tied up In dwolla/bank account <br />Need $500 loan that will be FULLY paid back by Monday of next week.<br />Have plenty of proof that I have the money to pay you back.<br />Should be getting $130 refund tommorow which will be paid to you before Monday<br />
