				Well, I have horrible insomnia. I&#039;ve tried everything. Today I hit the gym pretty hard and couldnt sleep tonight. So I took a couple melatonin and smoked a bowl. I layed in my bed for a couple hours and started getting pissed. I decided to take justice into my own hands.<br />So I took the whole damn bottle of melatonin. about 20 pills. I figured if that dont knock me out I might as well give up sleepin. Well the stuff takes about an hour to kick in so I&#039;m wide awake. I looked it up and apparently this stuff sometimes causes intense lucid dreams. Could I possibly be in for an unconscious trip?

				so you took the entire bottle.. afterwords you decided hey maybe I&#039;ll look up if I could have OD&#039;ed... <br /><br />really im guessing your body wont absorb it all that well and you&#039;ll probably be ok.. but seriously man, I hope your trolling for the sake of your own stupidity.

				You&#039;re probably going to be sick, or at least feel really fucked up when you wake up. I always do when I take Melatonin. :-\ Also you can&#039;t expect your body to conform to a specific sleeping pattern overnight, you have to keep a steady schedule for days, maybe even weeks before your body adjusts. So in my opinion just attempt to sleep at the same time everyday and eventually your body will realize it and you&#039;ll be able to sleep. If you&#039;re planning on taking a drug that you know will keep you up late in the night, invest in some Xanax for those special occasions so your schedule won&#039;t be jeopardized. :))

				benadryl is a great sleep aid for me. it works like a charm. ive never had sleeping problems in my life until i started smoking spice. i smoked it for 1 month every day and was left with lasting psychosis and paranoia. so i cant sleep because im scared. its totally shitty and im scared for no reason whatsoever. so the lesson is never smoke spice. i started because of UA&#039;s but its better to just not get high at all.

				I have the problem where I have trouble falling asleep, and when I do fall asleep, I can&#039;t wake up.&nbsp; I will press snooze about 100 times until its like 5 minutes until I have to be at work and I am late.&nbsp; <br /><br />I quit smoking weed, so I have even more trouble sleeping now it sucks ass, I also go to the gym, run, and try to read boring shit to fall asleep, my brain is like on overdrive constantly.&nbsp; I am such an insomniac I will blow through about 30+ news articles daily to try to make myself tired, which never works.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I have found that helps me trying to fall asleep, I try to clear my mind, just don&#039;t think about ANYTHING at all.&nbsp; If I think about tomorrow, or what I did today, I will never fall asleep.&nbsp; I just try make my mind blank and it eventually works.&nbsp; But if I take a nap during the day, it is impossible for me to fall asleep.&nbsp; I try to sleep deprive myself, that helps me sleep also.&nbsp;

				I know this might sound retarded...<br /><br />Sorry about the long ass post!<br /><br />But believe I have 2 main causes for insomnia. I know nothing about insomnia personally thru experience, since I&#039;ve very rarely been incapable of falling asleep.<br /><br />For the first reason, I believe much of us (or at least myself) can often suffer from an over active mind. This is a very basis for much if not all the chaos in the lives of humans (imo).<br /><br />We have a fantastic tool in the mind. But it can be and is for some and I think most an all the time thing... overly overactive. In control. The boss. And it begs the question... are you your mind? Or is your mind.... your brain? Is it you?<br /><br />So for the possible reason in not finding sleep... OP, I ask you.. do you notice and become aware of your breath during your day? And if you notice your shallowness of breathing or do you breathe much deeper often? I&#039;m honing towards meditation. Which I don&#039;t believe has anything to do with taking drugs. Funny, if true, or maybe just complete sense, the reason why we need to take drugs to fall asleep. <br /><br />If you cannot sleep, notice perhaps that your mind is on the ffwd. Never taking a break or slowing down. Until we force it to with drugs. <br /><br />So what if you sit in a quiet place and close your eyes and work on focusing on your breaths. Take deeper breaths. And deeper. Do this and try not to worry about your mind racing while trying. Focus on the breath, and everytime you find your mind wandering just bring it back to the breath. <br /><br />Some practice with this can provide some very relaxed feelings and have you a bit more at ease. Also recommend thai chi, yoga etc.. for some peace driving physical activites.<br /><br />Second reason - the people I know with the worst insomnia, who can never get to sleep without drugs, are the most toxic physically I know. And I&#039;m thinking its posable that the level of ones toxicity majorly contributes to being able to sleep. If raised in a conventional system on conventional foods with regular food practices (i.e. processed foods, chemical sprayed, gmo, chemical enhanced foods etc. etc.), this could be causing major imbalances in the body that won&#039;t &quot;just go away&quot;. Cleansing and detoxification is needed. <br /><br /><br />About cannabis: it can often help me sleep. But it is usually very stimulating to my mind. I&#039;ve driven 14 straight hours, been exhausted and hit a huge bong rip and won&#039;t be able to sleep for 3 hours! <br /><br />Sorry for the long post. <br /><br />Thoughts? Opinions?

				I think he made a comment along the lines of calling me crazy because of the Seroquel and called me a bipolar or a schizophrenic. Yeah I&#039;m pretty fucked bipolar wise. Seroquel is a good sleep drug for only a couple weeks. I can take 300mgs and be just fine. Ambien mixed with etizolam and Seroquel on the other hand is a pretty hypnotic experience.

				Not sure what happened to this thread. Too many retards running around trolling.<br /><br />Anyway, I had 8 hours straight of very vivid lucid dreams. Since I&#039;m a teenager they were all about girls I know irl and had sex with them in the dream. Is that creepy or normal for my age? On the topic of women I&#039;ve been working at the gym hard and dieting for 8 months now and am in great shape. How come I cant get laid? I see ugly assholes getting more pussy than me. In fact I got more back in 8th grade when I wore pink skin tight jeans. Maybe I should buy a new pair of them? <br />But yeah I woke up with a headache but some green tea fixed that right up.

Too many retards running around trolling.<br /><br />Anyway, I had 8 hours straight of very vivid lucid dreams. Since I&#039;m a teenager they were all about girls I know irl and had sex with them in the dream. Is that creepy or normal for my age? On the topic of women I&#039;ve been working at the gym hard and dieting for 8 months now and am in great shape. How come I cant get laid? I see ugly assholes getting more pussy than me.

On the other hand try not to fret over getting laid. Its not only about the looks (at least thats what I think), but also about your personality. Perhaps it was easier in 8th grade, due to the amount of girls curious about sex. You could put up an ad on your area`s Craigslist. You`ll definitely bump into someone.

				The trick is to barely try, but not care when you fail. At all.<br /><br />Make em wonder why you kinda seemed interested but then gave up so easy.<br /><br />I wish I had known this at your age but I was a retard, and now every single rejection kills me. Don&#039;t fall into that pattern or you&#039;ll be lonely your whole life.
