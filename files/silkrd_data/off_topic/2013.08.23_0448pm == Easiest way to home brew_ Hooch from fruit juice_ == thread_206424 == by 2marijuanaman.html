				One question the internet cant answer simply and definitively is how to make homemade alcohol without a kit.. Einstein said that if you truly understand something you can put it in terms a child could understand...<br /><br />Ill give the $5.21 in my account to anyone who would help me. I want to get drunk but theres a problem with buying it at the store. (the drinking age needs to be 18. We can go fight in wars but cant buy alcohol!?)<br /><br />Im sure this will also help poor people who cant afford alcohol at the store...<br /><br />So what I need is name of brands of yeast, sugar, and juice at the store, step by step instructions, and good measurements... needs to be easy enough for anyone to do

				<br />are you really asking how to make jailhouse hooch?.......if you&#039;re 18 i suggest making a few older friends and ask them to buy alcohol for you like every other teenager?&nbsp; Jailhouse hooch is absolutely disgusting and is very unsafe.&nbsp; Jailhouse hooch is only in existence because of alcoholics being thrown in jail and needing to find a way to stop their D.T.&#039;s&nbsp; It&#039;s not worth it man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Trust me.<br />

				When I was in jail... I made Buck!!! <br /><br />You will need: a tumbler w lid, sugar, kool aid mix(knockoff if your still in jail), and about a weeks worth of oranges.<br />Start out by collecting oranges in your tumbler all week. remove the skins and break into smaller chunks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mix up the kool aid with ALOT of sugar then put the oranges in the kool aid. <br />If you can sneak it into the shower then use the blistering hot water in there to heat the tumbler up.<br />If you cant or dont want to use the hot shower water then figure out how to clog the sink in your cell with as hot of water as possible( you will probably want to transfer the blistering hot shower water, its kinda fucked up they turn the shower to melt but the water at your sink is nowhere near as hot)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will want to do this everyday( the idea is to use the hot water to heat up the rotting fruit in your tumbler) after about two weeks of this I had a fairly high percentage of alcohol in the cup. <br />I couldnt really taste it but i did have a really nice buzz while watching TV.<br />

Every day i would turn the container upside down for a few hours and then open it a few times a day to let out built up pressure. after 8 days i filtered the scum off the top and then decanted it back into container. I added some more suger and left for 3 days. on day ten or eleven i did a final filter with cloth and presto had a reasonably strong drink. you can put things in to stop the brewing process so the sugar doesnt get used up and to keep it going sour. add sugar or water to taste. yummy.
