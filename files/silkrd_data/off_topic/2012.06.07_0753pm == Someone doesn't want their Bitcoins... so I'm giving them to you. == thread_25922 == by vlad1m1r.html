				Dear all,<br /><br />As most of you know by now I operate a service selling Bitcoins in exchange for cash to people in the UK &amp; Europe. <br /><br />Touching wood so far the service has gone without a hitch - with one exception. Two weeks ago I processed an order for a new user who despite repeated e-mails and messages on here has failed to supply me with a BTC address to receive their Bitcoins. It would honestly seem he doesn&#039;t want his money.<br /><br />After careful consideration I have decided to give the coins back to the community via the Bitcoin Faucet (https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/) - I have set up an account on Bitcoinfog to dribble the 11.632 Bitcoins he ordered into the faucet over the course of the next couple of weeks and anyone who wants 0.05 of those can go to the site and help themselves (provided they have a google account..)<br /><br />As for the cash profits, once again I don&#039;t feel it would be right for me to hang on to these as I&#039;d be profiteering from people&#039;s forgetfulness. As such I&#039;ve donated my commission to COPS - a UK registered charity dedicated to helping the families of police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty, rebuild their lives. <br /><br />Never let it be said we&#039;re without a sense of humour. :-D<br /><br />If my client is reading this and actually does want his BTC after all, please send me a message, or else they&#039;ll go back to the people!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

I think I am going to make this an actual policy from now on - I think 14 days from when the order arrives is a reasonable time to supply a BTC address! If not the coins go back to the community. You can&#039;t say fairer than that surely...<br /><br />V.
