				Go at least 2 days!!! You&#039;re buyin the 3 day pass (no singles available this year) you may as well make good use of it. <br /><br />My big concern right now is what substance shall i do each night lol. I obviously can&#039;t be rolling 3 days in a row. I&#039;m thinking maybe acid night one and mdma night 2? I&#039;m pretty comfortable with psychadelics, but i&#039;ve also never been around that many people on them before lololol. That kinda wigs me out. You ever done fests on acid? Is it tough to be around that many others?<br /><br />

Oh my goddddddd hahahaha. Get ready dude/dudette. My first festival, I cried when my shit kicked in. My first one was nocturnal fest. I was standing there jamming out in the crowd 100% sober when all of a sudden the red and yellow lights just started growing up into the sky. It looked as if the whole sky was just pulsating red/yellow. I thought I had witnessed the Aurora Borealis in the south hahahahaha. I was sitting there just out of my fuckin mind asking my sober friends &quot;ARE YOU SEEING THIS?!&quot; I proceeded to cry right after that because it was probably the most beautiful thing I&#039;d ever witnessed.
