				There is already a thread on this the best advice I saw was keep it in your wallet, behind or between a bunch of credit cards.&nbsp; This should not raise a problem at all even in international flights.

				I&#039;d personally check it, but put it inside something that will at least somewhat protect it from any heat or light, and then put it in like a coat pocket or something. I&#039;ve never done that before, though.

				I have personally done exactly as previously specified, placed them concealed in my wallet during a domestic flight with no issues. Even went through the x-ray with no red flags and upon arrival, hits were still active. Not saying it&#039;s ever a good idea, but people determined enough to do something will do it.

				have some other paper around it....post it notes maybe with some phone #&#039;s or something.&nbsp; They don&#039;t go through peoples wallets.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want to keep a whole sheet in my wallet in my pocket during the flight though.&nbsp; So maybe keep your wallet in a backpack or other carryon after you go through TSA checkpoint.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t overthink it.....they are looking for things to take down planes....not a sheet in your wallet.&nbsp; That said be smart about everything you carry when going through their stupid checkpoints.

				Awesome! Thanks alot for the info jackstraw glad to hear somebody&#039;s view on this. :)&nbsp; Very much agree on keeping them there for the whole flight&#039;, definitely a no no.&nbsp; &nbsp;Would you think it would be safer to put the wallet in a backpack or just carry it on me ?&nbsp; Definitely wanna be smart on what i bring through there check points. Wish i didnt have to bring them to an airport period.&nbsp;

				Either your backpack or in a jacket pocket that you have to take off and put in the bin to be scanned.&nbsp; LSD is the easiest substance to smuggle.&nbsp; As long as you don&#039;t have anything else on you that could get you in trouble you will be fine.&nbsp; And by that I mean it would more likely that they would find weed on you than a sheet or 2 in your wallet.<br />I pretty much would always fly with some amount of weed on me but I haven&#039;t had to fly in the past couple of years since they have the new scanners.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just be prepared and be confident.&nbsp; Could also have them in a book as bookmarks and you would be fine too.

				I think the best thing to do is think about every other time you&#039;ve gone through the airport security line without anything on you. Remember to be a little flustered, annoyed with the whole security process and forget about what you have on you. Worry about catching your flight. Don&#039;t dodge eye contact with TSA. It&#039;s just paper after all ;) <br /><br />I went through security with 5 books (no drugs but all on suspicious topics like terrorism etc) in my backpack. TSA didn&#039;t even check to see what big 5 books I had but then again I looked more like a student. If you are conservative, well dressed, disguise it in business-y papers.<br /><br />I think we give TSA too much credit sometimes but better too much than too little I suppose.
