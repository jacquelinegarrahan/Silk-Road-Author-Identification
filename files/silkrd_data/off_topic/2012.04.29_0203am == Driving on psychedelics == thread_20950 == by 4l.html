				Had to make a throwaway forum profile not connected to my buyers account to ask this one... don&#039;t want any of the vendors to ban me from buying (;<br /><br />Do any of you drive on psychedelics, or other drugs for that matter?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some have driven drunk...<br /><br />I typically wait until about an hour and a half after the peak, once I have a good idea of how strong the trip is going to get.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this on moderate doses of LSD, mushrooms, moxy, 2c-p, etc. probably 50 times and have not had the slightest incident.&nbsp; The feeling is fucking amazing!&nbsp; Really, on a warm summer day, it&#039;s one of the best things there is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone on highways, but city streets with the windows down is more enjoyable.<br /><br />The other great thing is that it opens up a lot of possibilities that you wouldn&#039;t normally be able to do in a single trip, and for longer trips like 2c-p it is very useful.<br /><br />Bring on the negative karma!

				I once picked up shrooms and ate a light dose maybe 1.5 to 2 grams on the spot and had a 45 minute drive back home that was very interesting and enjoyable. Everything was vibrant and the trees on the side of the rode from far away looked like they bent over to form a tree tunnel and as I approached they would stand back up before I got to them which made me giggle.<br /><br />As far as the road it seemed normal and the lines didn&#039;t mess with me just the landscape at a distance did and I kept feeling like I missed my turn and had been driving way to long or that I didn&#039;t recognize where I was and must have missed a turn, but would look at the clock and realize that was impossible due to the time that had lapsed and just went with not recognizing where I was until I finally got to my turn and then things became familiar.<br /><br />I felt totally safe, and in control. Never did I have a doubt I would wreck. Everything felt like I was glued to the road and my lane like I was a train on tracks, so there was no way for me to go off course.

				It&#039;s idioits like you all that make drug use banned/regulated in the first place.&nbsp; Driving on psychs is the worst fucking idea you could ever have.&nbsp; Get a bicycle that = &lt;3 and much more safer, at least if you crash into a car you won&#039;t kill an innocent person, only yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Think before you ruin your fucking life people, some of you are begging for a pair of silver bracelets :o

				Yah, it was not a wise decision, but I felt I knew my body and mind well enough to drive safely.<br /><br />I took enough were I knew they wouldn&#039;t impair me or my driving abilities, but still get an effect. I felt very in control and properly able to drive the whole time, and more so then times when I was high off weed and drove. It seemed to sharpen my vision and mental acuity to everything that was going on. <br /><br />I knew there was no way in hell I was going to wreck or hit someone or even swerve for that matter. If I got pulled over for speeding or whatever I am positive that the cop wouldn&#039;t of known the difference, because I was not tripping hard or anything just a light trip but fully functional.<br /><br />Still you are right about it not being a good idea, but no worse than smoking pot and driving or anything else in my years of driving that I have done and shouldn&#039;t of. I at least felt and knew I was fine.

				I love driving. <br /><br />OP sounds like he makes good judgement, as long he is not endangering I approve. It sounds super awesome.<br /><br />I personally would NEVER drive on weed, it fucks me up way bad, I would feel more in control driving moderately drunk opposed to even slightly stoned.<br /><br />stay safe bros

				i driven on much weed (if you smoke all the time, it&#039;s really IF you drive that ur always high anyway)<br /><br />but i only drove on plenty acid as a younger kid... i went to school on it, to work (wtf was i thinking??), and driving sure.... but sometimes they were the wildest scariest craziest trips ever. and maybe just a couple hours. if you are frying and you don&#039;t see the metal cage capable of destroying flesh and life, you should definitely NOT drive frying. <br /><br />I would never do it today. I got wrapped up in a mush high drive on accident a while back and that was fucking stressful as shit haha. <br /><br />I think you who dig it are likely a touch on the younger side. You might handle yourself extremely well, but it&#039;s that one time you fuckin blow it that you can&#039;t change. Just be sure you fully comprehend the implications and chances you are taking. Maybe it might take you a couple rolled cars, totaled cars and friends dead or in major busted up condition. It does happen, and it changes everything. I won&#039;t share details but it gets real real, real fast. I&#039;d say cruising the streets are likely the more safer kinds of psychedriving. <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t drive when high, I don&#039;t want to put others in danger. But if you are 100% sure you can do it, then I don&#039;t see anything wrong. On the other hand, i LOVE to ride my bike when tripping :)
