				Negativekarma is right...&nbsp; They even extort people for money at the entrance.&nbsp; The DEA, ATF, FBI, state, and local police all go to Burning Man.&nbsp; Undercovers have even danced around naked at Burning Man before.&nbsp; You can DEFINITELY not talk about SR freely.&nbsp; There are undercovers impersonating raver bunnies at BM.&nbsp; Undercovers will ask about things as small as joints.&nbsp; Law enforcement even makes their own art vehicles that they drive around at burning man every year.&nbsp; They will go around to different camps.&nbsp; They have their own setups in different camps too where people don&#039;t know that they are LE.&nbsp; There are more undercover law enforcement officers at BM than any other place or event that I can possibly think of.<br /><br />Stay safe!

				Um, you&#039;re not going to get busted for talking about anything. You&#039;re gonna get busted for clearly and openly displaying drugs &lt;- Don&#039;t do this.<br /><br />There are not as many LEA as I would have thought, had I just read this thread so far. Many of the LEA there are BLM (Bureau of Land Management) Rangers, who are pretty awesome and go to raves in uniform. They will confiscate drugs and give you a few hundred dollar parking ticket for them, if they notice you with them in the open.<br /><br />The place is so goddamn huge that no, you are not under constant surveillance. There are so many places there where you can actually find peace and quiet with nobody else around. And my car has never been searched except by BM-employed greeters to make sure I&#039;m not hiding people in the trunk. I think a fair amount of drugs come in by plane (there&#039;s a makeshift airport there).<br /><br />I can&#039;t personally advocate a SR meetup or anything, as this obviously seems like something the DEA would love to hang out at.

				Saulgood, you should check out the official BM forum.&nbsp; They do search people and camps when under covers ask you for a joint or you offer drugs.&nbsp; They do search camps.&nbsp; They do bust people.&nbsp; They have extorted many people for $500 at the entrance.

				Yikes, yeah, there is some crazy shit on there. The entrance seemed to be the worst part, it was dripping with cops the last couple years.<br /><br />As I recommended: Don&#039;t publicly display, sell or gift drugs to anyone you don&#039;t know!! : )

				if you wake up one morniong and a dirty smelly raver bunny girl splats a big shit outside your tent door and then blurts out &quot;peace man&quot; and you have to use your sock to lift her shit away from her door do not assume she wants to share your drugs with you.. she could be undercover.<br /><br />remember.. burning man is more about public displays of human defecation and the protest of the manufacture of toilet paper than spreading the love of silk road

				HAHA, I&#039;m thinking most of these replies are from people that have only heard stories! Don&#039;t go waving your drugs around and advertizing, there are a lot of under covers out there, but they really don&#039;t bug people for using, just distributing. If you offer something to an UC they can search your camp, so just be smart, tell someone you meet just as much as someone you would meet on the streets of your home town. Talk and get to know someone before offering them or hinting at any drugs, cops will lose interest and look for the next mark to bust pretty quick out there! I can spot a UC out there from a mile away, they wear lots of lights and flashy colors and furs, they only want to talk about drugs, they lose interest quick when you don&#039;t talk about drugs, they range from 19-35 (most of the time), they also tend to be some of the cleaner people out there, they get to go home and shower right after arresting someone!&nbsp; <br /><br />I will be there, but SR and the goods that I sell will never be mentioned to ANYONE!!! And that has nothing to do with burning man, it is probably the best place to socialize about it but it is just a bad idea to advertize any illegal activity! You wouldn&#039;t go to a gun show and talk about all the illegal guns you buy/sell! You wouldn&#039;t go to a pharmacy and talk about the scrips you buy/sell, you don&#039;t go to a concert to buy/sell pirated music.... do you? Stay smart, stay safe!
