				yeah I know drug cocktails can be dangerous but some are worth it if you do them rarely.<br />They are more of one of those things I&#039;ve like to do really fucking rarely.<br />Only ones I&#039;ve done that I can think of was PEESING (randomly unintentionally made with friends)<br />Alcohol (quite a lot) mephedrone (don&#039;t do anymore) MDMA then soon as the peek slows down MXE (also don&#039;t do now)<br /><br />also there is:<br />speedballing<br />candyflipping<br />hippyflip (shrooms + mdma)<br />jediflip (shrooms + lsd + mdma)<br />then just weed + anything esp benzos<br /><br />Any others that are good? Not really looking to kill myself though and I don&#039;t do 95% of RC&#039;s in case they are included.<br />Just want something fun :) any links would be nice also<br /><br />Thanksssss

				Anything that starts with LSD is going to be a great trip. ;) I&#039;m not a fan of mixing stimulants with anything however, as they make my trips feel dirty.<br /><br />The best combos always involve the following drugs in my opinion.<br />Marijuana<br />Mushies<br />LSD<br />MDMA<br />2C-E<br />MXE<br />2C-B<br />25i-NBOMe<br />DMT<br />Ketamine<br />Nitrous<br />Mescaline<br />Last of all OTC drugs and less common booster drugs to make the trips more enjoyable and healthier.

It helps to wait until after the peak too, which can also bring the trip back to speed.

				Why did I have to break up with my girl THEN find SR :(.<br />All the other women that are or could be in my life are too flat for anything like that. Hmmf!<br /><br />Yeah good point! I agree shrooms probably would be my best bet well as long as I don&#039;t get the slight sickly feeling I sometimes get as that + DMT smoke = probably not too present <br />

				10mgs 4-ac0-dmt + 50mcg 25i nbome (yes 0.1 of the average blotter)&nbsp; = 100mcg LSD, great combo for acid lovers who are pissed off with all the uncertainty surrounding the legitimacy of the product and comes in at a fraction of the price, approx £1.30 a dose. Music sounds incredible and you can carry it off in public with ease.
