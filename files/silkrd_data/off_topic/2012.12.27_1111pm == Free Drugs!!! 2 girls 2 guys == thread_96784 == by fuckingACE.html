				Every time I see the phrase &quot;2 girls&quot; written out like that I think of that video involving 1 cup.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had opium, been wanting to give it a try... even more so after following your mushy (mushy?) posts last night, Ace.

				It was always our intention when we joined to start vending. We&#039;ve been lurking / researching for about 6 months whilst we cut down our street operations in London. About 2 weeks ago we took the plunge and started out with small batches on here and it went very well, got a tonne of orders in, sold about 3 sheets of acid and 30g opium. Were waiting to evaluate the feedback before we put up larger listings.. Check our review thread: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94723.0<br />As for the language, I&#039;m a British guy and Rox is pure British also, hence the prose. Our street operation is pretty much done. We&#039;ve only got 2 people selling there to our old customers. The rest of the crew moved to sunny Spain.<br /><br />As for you naughty TrashBox&nbsp; sure, being horny is a valid reason to want drugs. Opium it is, PGP your address to our vendor account on SR and Ill have some goodies sent over to ya. Ill put a lil surprise in there too as your a sexy lil miss. We can have a smoke up together in cyberspace when it arrives<br /><br />ACE

				OMG yay free drugs i have never tried acid but Im a pretty experienced psyconaut.<br />I actually just checked your vendor page yesterday after seeing your post in the other thread and was thinking about eventually buying the 2 pack you had listed. Price was legit! I will DEF leave a full trip report and feedback and likely return if I like it (prob will) since I can&#039;t really mess with drugs anymore, my plan has been to get more familiar with psychadelics in 2013. I have experience with lots of MDxx and Shrooms but never acid and I have been researching it for the last few months to prepare for my first experience(s) I acutally sold ALOT of acid 6 years ago and never used it once! always regretted it as I no longer have local connects.<br /><br />would be super stoked!!<br /><br />never tried 2cb either but much more interested in lsd :)<br /><br />

It&#039;s just my nature. <br /><br />I will DEF write up a good trip report, I am into that kinda stuff and I find documenting helps with stuff you might otherwise forget.<br /><br />who should i send the address to and where should i post the report?
