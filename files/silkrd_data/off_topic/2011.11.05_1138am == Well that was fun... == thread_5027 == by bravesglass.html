				Last night I decided to see what davidd&#039;s methylone was all about. I bought the 175mg pre-disolved vial and drank it with a bit of OJ. Needless to say, I got caught up listening to and downloading dubstep remixes (namely butch clancy and skrillex) after watching this fucking guy:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXO-jKksQkM<br /><br />good times...thanks davidd

				Maybe I should have bought from you, davidd.&nbsp; I just picked up an 8-ball from another vendor and it&#039;s been a disappointment.&nbsp; Just major speediness.&nbsp; Very little euphoria.&nbsp; I&#039;m a long-term coke user but I had not used in a few weeks when I snorted about 120mg of methylone.&nbsp; After 45min to an hour, it was like, &quot;OK, I&#039;m jacked up now...what else is there?&quot;&nbsp; My girlfriend had the same experience.<br /><br />The taste is just a bad chemical taste, it&#039;s pure white grainy powder.&nbsp; No numbing on the tongue (not expecting it).&nbsp; Any idea what I might actually have here?&nbsp; Or is this what methylone is all about?<br /><br />BF

				I bought some M1 from digitalink and had the same effects that you mention BigFlake. Luckily I also bought some from our man davidd at the same time so I could get a feel of the difference between vendors. The contrast couldn&#039;t have been greater. I ended up throwing the other shit away, I don&#039;t even think it even contained methylone. It was just a nasty tweaky buzzkill. davidd&#039;s methylone is euphoric, energizing, clearheaded, and very gentle on the mind. Great for dancing, socializing, whatever. For me (and according to many other reports) it&#039;s like a tame version of MDMA. It&#039;s a great platform to build a wicked high off of IMO. Goes great with GHB or K IME. I highly recommend the stuff, its worthwhile for sure. Too bad other vendors are ruining people&#039;s impression of this stuff, it&#039;s great.

				Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely try davidd on my next methylone purchase, after I recover from this crap.<br /><br />BF
