				I would love a logo and possibly a watermark image.<br /><br />I think this is a great idea.<br /><br />Can I ask you how long this would take. Are you listed as a seller and would you be mailing these to me or just sending them over the net.<br /><br />Also would you make one logo and I would have to take that no matter what. Would you make a few images and I would choice from one?<br /><br />Please get back asap.<br /><br />Like I said, I am very interested!<br /><br />PaythePiper

If you are unhappy with it I will get some ideas from you to build on the first design to meet your requirements. I can send them over the net (not ideal as image hosting website decrease the quality of images!) or to your email address. I will only expect payment once you are happy with the images. I can do this in an hour or two - if you have any special requests you can PM me so I can make the logo as close to what you are looking for as possible.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Lloyd

				Lloyd like I said I am VERY interested. I&#039;m not much of an artist so how about you make something up and show it to me. Unless I really want something different I most likely won&#039;t have you change it at all!<br /><br />As soon as you are ready let me know and we can get this started.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that you are not a seller and this could be seen as an OOE transaction getting me kicked off which is the LAST think I want. <br /><br />Perhaps I could list it on my own seller account, buy it with my buyers account, and send you the money from there. That way DPR gets his fees and everyone is happy. What do you think about that idea?<br /><br />If it works I would love you to get on my logo and I also want the watermark logo. (at total of 7 BTC&#039;s correct?)<br /><br />Personally I think this is one hell of a good idea!<br /><br />Get back to me. Either of the forums or on SR. I am going to sleep right now but will be up in 3 to 4 hours.<br /><br />Thanks Lloyd. I&#039;m really excited to see what you come up with!<br /><br />Also the Post below wanted to judge the quality of your work. I see that you are willing to make up a sample to I will have a sample and quite possibly the finished product!<br /><br />PaythePiper

				HELL YES! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! 100%. I THINK I DECIDED AGAINST A WATERMARK FOR NOW, BUT DIN&#039;T BE SURPISED IF I CONTACT YOU IN A FEW DAYS ASKING FOR THE WATER MARK.<br /><br />OKAY SO HOW DO WE DO THIS WITHOUT GOING OOE. I DON&#039;T KNOW HOW NEW YOU ARE BUT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE DONE IN THE LISTINGS. DO YOU LIKE MY IDEA WITH PUTTING IT ON MY LISTING? THAT WAY ADMIN WOULD GET THEIR FEES AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY!<br /><br />ONE MORE THING. I HAVE TO SEND THE BTC&#039;S TO MY ACCOUNT AND THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR, AND I&#039;M ALSO ABOUT TO CRASH. LIKE I SAID FOR ABOUT 3 TO 4 HOURS. BUT BY THE TIME I WAKE I WILL HAVE YOUR BTC&#039;S AND YOU WILL BE PAID.<br /><br />IF YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME RUNNING OFF READ MY REPUTATION. I&#039;VE BEEN HERE 6 MONTHS AND HAVE 100% REP. IF THAT DOESN&#039;T TELL YOU I&#039;LL PAY YOU EVERY DIME THEN NOTHING WILL!<br /><br />WHAT DO YOU THINK.<br /><br />HONESTLY I LOVE THE LOG0! YOU&#039;RE A HELL OF AN ARTIST. ALSO DON&#039;T BE AFRAID TO SHOW OTHERS YOUR WORK YOU DID FOR ME SO THEY CAN JUDGE YOUR WORK. I&#039;M DAMN PROUD OF YOUR WORK!

				Hi there,<br /><br />I am fairly new to SR so I didn&#039;t know about the selling/purchasing rules on SR. I think that will be a grand idea if we do it through SR! Im glad you like it! If you will send me your email address I will mail it to you. I am heading out of the office for a while but will send it to you as soon as I get back.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Lloyd

				I sent you a private message with my email address. This is great. I also explained how I will set up the listing and how I will be paying you as soon as I wake.<br /><br />My logo is amazing! I&#039;m really excited about it! Honestly you should think about raising your rates. Maybe wait a bit to see how business goes, and if it picks up raise your rates. Vendors will pay for your quality work.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Pay you soon!

The watermark is the same logo just with the white background removed so it is transparent. All you need to do is open up your product images in a program such as paint and over-lay the image that I will send you on top of your product image in the position that you want - there&#039;s your watermark!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t received your PM with your email address. I also slightly modified my previous image but I will send you both images in GIF format to maintain the transparent background.<br /><br />Here are previews of the three images I will be sending you - please note that Flikr have decreased the quality and your real images will be 100% crystal clear ;)<br /><br />Preview 1 - https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7111/7008040739_9169525196_z.jpg<br />Preview 2 - https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7242/7008040689_8308b2ca38_z.jpg<br /><br />Which one do you like best?<br /><br />Forum Image - https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7199/7008055059_c805d91d7d_t.jpg<br /><br />Regards,<br />Lloyd

				Strange. Okay. I&#039;m going to send my email right now!<br /><br />Also I&#039;ve just got to tell you how much I LOVE YOUR WORK! As soon as you start building up some clientele you will be the man and at that point I would AT LEAST double your prices. They are worth that times ten!<br /><br />Okay so I put up the listing on my own sellers account and I paid for it. So now all I need is to know where to send the 4 BTC. Also you&#039;re a straight badass! I am STOKED to get the watermark and see how well it works on my images. I can&#039;t thank you enough. Seriously.<br /><br />Okay so I&#039;m gonna PM you again with my email address. If for any reason you don&#039;t get it just let me know. I must have screwed something up last night when I sent you my email.<br /><br />Okay my new friend. This is an awesome transaction. Just PM me where to send the 4 BTC and I&#039;ll PM you my email.<br /><br />Then I think we&#039;re set. As soon as you get the BTC&#039;s just send the item to my email and we made one hell of a deal. Also just so you know I will be recommending you to everyone and their dog.<br /><br />Oh last thing. I think I&#039;m all for preview 1. It looks BADASS!<br /><br />Thanks. If you need anything just PM me. I look forward to receiving these... and as I said before. If you would like to show other clients your work I would be more than happy for you to show them mone. I&#039;m proud as shit over it and I still can&#039;t get over it!<br /><br />PaythePiper

				Anyone interested in a custom image or watermark for their specific brand. Well we now have an ingenious artist that goes by the nam&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e Lloyd and is AMAZING! Honestly I was expecting some quality work, but this guy KNOW HIS SHIT! HE IS AMAZING!<br /><br />I would recommend Lloyd to anyone and everyone. Plus his prices are DIRT cheap! The guy&#039;s work is impeccable and I am still amazed at what he has to offer.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not quite sure yet, don&#039;t hesitate. Lloyd knows what he&#039;s doing and goes the extra mile to make you as happy as possible~<br /><br />I plan on doing other work with Lloyd in the very near future for other projects - he&#039;s that good.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sell yourself short. This will make you look more professional as a seller and make you look as though you know what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />People want to work with professionals and this is the perfect way to show sellers you are a professional!<br /><br />Don&#039;t Wait. Be a Professional Today!<br /><br />PaythePiper
