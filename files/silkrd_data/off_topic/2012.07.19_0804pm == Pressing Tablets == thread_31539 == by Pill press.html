				(former) SR Pill pressers,<br /><br />I tried to press &#039;test&#039; pills with corn starch and these tablets just crumble apart any tips/suggestions on making a strong firm tablet?<br /><br />Will have microcrystalineceluse soon will this be able to make a strong firm pill?<br /><br />Help greatly appreciated!<br /><br />NOTE: manual pill press w/o a engine

				The microcystalline cellulose should solve your problem(s).<br /><br />There are many factors at play, including how much compression your press offers (probably not a lot being a manual, but this can be a good thing: highly compressed pills can take too long to break apart), the particle sizing of your active ingredient, the particle sizing of your excipients and the shape can matter too. <br /><br />Lactose has good binding properties too, and should be easier to acquire than the microcrystalline cellulose. Consider doing a mix of the two to save resources. It might even work on its own.<br /><br />Starch was a doomed effort, but having a small amount can help break apart a highly compressed tablet upon hitting moisture since moisture causes the starch to inflate like a balloon and break the tablet apart.<br /><br />The above is all speculation, seriously. Please report with your actual results.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t try to directly compress tablets that will contain just a few milligrams of active ingredient, your tablets will be so variable that you&#039;ll be putting lives at risk. You&#039;ll need to know how to do a granulation if you&#039;re working with such potent compounds.

				If you&#039;re using a deep or sticky press, get a small amount of magnesium stearate to help with releasing the tablets.

				If its one of the under $100 screw style ones you are never goona get a good hard pill. Had one of those things a while back it made super soft pills would fall into 3 pieces if you dropped from 3 feet. Recommend using caps so much simpler.
