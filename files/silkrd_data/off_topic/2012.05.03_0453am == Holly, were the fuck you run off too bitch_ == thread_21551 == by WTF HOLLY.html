				You come on here saying your boy Tony had to have been popped... because he would never ever ever scam any of us.&nbsp; &nbsp;You give us some bullshit story about a friend getting a knock and talk and didn&#039;t stick around to answer any other questions that might help solve this thing and put everyone a little more at ease, one way or the other.<br /><br />My personal opinion....&nbsp; You vouched for this guy and don&#039;t want to believe he scammed everyone.&nbsp; So you make everyone paranoid with this fucking bullshit thread.&nbsp; R U fucking kidding me????????<br /><br />Holly - your post used to carry a lot of weight with me, but to see you still clinging to the fact that tony didn&#039;t scam everyone is pathetic. Get The Fuck Outta Here<br /><br />Also I think there is a thread that is now tracking the movement of Tony&#039;s coins in his effort to convert them to cash.<br /><br />Face it Holly, your boys a crook.... Don&#039;t get everyone excited with out some proof and get that dick out of your mouth and those ten-strips off your tongue long enough to see the facts.

				It would make alot of sense for tony to have everyone think he got pinched...and not because he wants us to like him. If we all believe he got pinched then through default theres no way he could ever come back to SR....thats exactly what he wants all of us to let our guard down so he can pull a next scam...TONY WILL BE BACK AGAIN TO SCAM<br /><br />EDIT: Actually hes probably still here...

				to simplyanon<br /><br />I didn&#039;t want to get my forum name in the way of the real issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would open a hole other door on this thread that would just distract from the main point, why the fuck did Holly make that bullshit thread and just split.&nbsp; Leaving a bunch of people ordering from him paranoid.&nbsp; Telling them to clean house.<br /><br />Like I said, stop hitting refresh, or hitting<br />Show unread posts since last visit.<br />Show new replies to your posts.<br />and clicking on this thread unless you have something constructive to say or fuck off and post elsewhere<br /><br />or take some of those 25i tabs you got off kwiktrips and chill the fuck out with this high then though attitude

				From my point of view, people who don&#039;t use their real forum names are afraid of what the post will do to their reputations.&nbsp; The wish to be able to rant or make accusations without incurring the cost that might accrue to their real (although anonymous) forum names.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are some real and valid reasons to use a throw away name for some things, but not for this sort of stuff.<br /><br />If you have something to say, man/woman up and say it using your real forum name.&nbsp; If you are too afraid to use your real name to say something, don&#039;t say it.<br /><br />We get too many one off names here throwing out conspiracy theories, attacking vendors AND buyers with little to no facts to back them up.&nbsp; All it does is create confusion, fear and anger.<br /><br />That&#039;s my two cents worth, and I&#039;m not afraid to use my real forum name to say it.

				Just as I posted my response, the prior post appeared about not wanting a vendor to give out your real address.<br /><br />I can see that as being a legitimate fear, but lets be honest, how many of these rants under throw away names do you think did it because of that fear?<br /><br />Most of them probably didn&#039;t even think of it.

Get The Fuck Outta Here<br /><br />Also I think there is a thread that is now tracking the movement of Tony&#039;s coins in his effort to convert them to cash.<br /><br />Face it Holly, your boys a crook.... Don&#039;t get everyone excited with out some proof and get that dick out of your mouth and those ten-strips off your tongue long enough to see the facts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />-1<br /><br />I don&#039;t appreciate the hostility man, you&#039;re really fucking up my good vibes with this slander. :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, the guy is right to be angry.<br /><br />A respected member of the community has the gall to come on here and claim KNOWLEDGE where there is none.<br /><br />&quot;My friend got busted therefore Tony got busted&quot;<br /><br />She completely ignored the OBVIOUS explanation of<br /><br />&quot;My friend got busted therefore they found it in the mail&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but someone who jumps to ABSURD conclusions like the former without considering the latter deserves to get burnt for it, ESPECIALLY if they are a respected member here.<br /><br />Hollys bullshit will only add to the mess of noise on this issue, she/he deserves to get accosted if they&#039;re muddying the waters and spreading nonsense<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah...but I couldn&#039;t give a damn about tony or anything even remotely related to him. I&#039;ve never conducted any business with him, so why should I? Quite frankly, I&#039;m sick of all of this tony bullshit and people need to get over it because it&#039;s getting old. The fact that we&#039;re in a thread bitching about a previous thread is ridiculous. As far as I&#039;m aware, the more you pick at a scab the bigger the scar will be. So I think I have the right to discourage this by using my ability to give negative rep because that&#039;s how I feel, am I right or am I wrong? ???

				I mean if it was someone with a couple of hundred of posts, whatever..... But this is Holly.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really trusted and respected her.&nbsp; For her to come on here with this BS.&nbsp; &nbsp; I know of at least several people who were scared to death about this post.<br /><br />Then she logs off before offering really any explanation???????????&nbsp; I just would like some answers....<br /><br />My OP was a little rash and I apologize for it, I was pissed.&nbsp; Fact remains, I and I think the community would like a little more info before we &quot;clean house&quot; and put a lawyer on retainer.... Dig?

				Wanted to get her attention, maybe you should think before you type such a idiotic post....&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m locking this shit.&nbsp; You guys are fucking idiots with nothing better to do<br /><br />Hopefully Holly answers some of these questions about her buddy that got popped and put some minds at ease<br /><br />Happy trolling gentlemen!
