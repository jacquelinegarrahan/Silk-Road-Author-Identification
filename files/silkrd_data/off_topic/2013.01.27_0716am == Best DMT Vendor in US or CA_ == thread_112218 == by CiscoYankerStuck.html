				I&#039;m looking to make my first purchase of DMT from the road. I&#039;ve noticed there are only a handful of vendors from the US and Canada and I would like to hear about your experiences with them. Who&#039;s the best/worst?<br /><br />Also, do you know any vendors currently in stealth mode that would be interested in a new customer with several hundred dollars in transactions? (feel free to PM if so)<br /><br /><br />Peace.

				Why don&#039;t you try the new vendor PPLLUURR out? JOR usually has dmt also. What is a good dose in order to have a break thru? See I have tried DMT several time but just sprinkling it on top of buds in a bowl. Do I need a vapor pipe like a meth glass pipe with a ball on the end? Really tho how many deep held in tokes is enough for the averag guy to have a breakthru?

I didn&#039;t see JOR with any listings; I&#039;ll have to send him a message about it.

You don&#039;t need a vapor pipe for it but I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s the best way to smoke it. Myself I just weigh out my doses and put it on some weed. In my experience a breakthrough for the freebase is around 50mg and for the changa&#039;s I&#039;ve had about 200-300mg. I myself like to take about 35mg and walk through my house as every room has different patterns and hallucinations, it&#039;s like walking into different worlds. too much floors me and I don&#039;t want to move stand up or anything, that being said breakthroughs are quite the experience and I&#039;d highly recommend it!

				JoR ships from the UK, so doesn&#039;t qualify if you&#039;re looking for a US/CA vendor, though by all reports his stuff is great.. My recommendation would be for Rogerpete. His stuff is top notch.
