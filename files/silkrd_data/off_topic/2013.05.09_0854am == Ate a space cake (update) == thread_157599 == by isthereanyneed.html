				Updates please (if still possible :D)!<br />Ahh, I remember making hash butter for the first time with my best stoner friend using high quality dutch hash... We drank it dissolved in a hot chocolate. The taste was godly and we were completely fucked up for eight hours :D

				On my first trip in amsterdam I had a girlfriend that didn&#039;t smoke at all, so in order to get her high we had to buy spacecakes.<br /><br />Not knowing how hard it will hit her she ate 1,1/5. She got knocked the fuck out but thats not all wait. I was also incredibly high, so i thought she&#039;s dead for many hours till i tottaly forgot about her thanks to the mushrooms.<br /><br />It was kind of a bad experience but funny overall<br /><br />I know its off topic but it was worth sharing. She woke up with no memory the next day.<br /><br />You should record your trip itll be funny tmrw
