				So I smoked some&nbsp; DMT,&nbsp; as im typing this I can see a machine elf on my wall I can feel it communicating with me but not in words. I see a bunch of moving aztec **** on my ceiling. I feel like I found myself in some weird way. I never thought I could hear colors until now.<br /><br />Right now I can feel it dying off as im getting back from hyperspace.<br />

				Here is my first experience, posted it elsewhere but i thought you might like it.<br /><br />I was introduced to DMT about 2-3 months ago here on SR.&nbsp; I have done my research on DMT through erowid, and have watched that DMT Documentary on Netflix.&nbsp; IDK why but I had a huge boner for psychedelics so I decided to make a DMT purchase.<br /><br />I have since then made MANY DMT purchases from SR and I probably won’t waste much time with other psychedelics anymore.&nbsp; DMT has hands down the most amazing, spiritual, Zen, calming, and meaningful trips I have ever experienced.&nbsp; The first purchase was changa and this was extremely easy to smoke and has a STRONG psychedelic trip.<br /><br />I just packed a dry bong up with the changa and gently lit the herb.&nbsp; Remember, DMT vaporizes at a very low temperature, so less fire is better.&nbsp; I slowly chalked it up, ever so gently pulling on the tube.&nbsp; I did this 2 times as quickly as I could.&nbsp; I like to think of smoking DMT as a 30 second window, you have 30 seconds to smoke as gently and as fast as you can, while holding in the smoke for at least 4 seconds.<br /><br />Soon as I put the bong down I started doing what I call “Phasing&quot;.&nbsp; It’s like I am this big instrumental gong and someone comes buy and strikes my center with the mallet causing an enormous ringing/vibration.&nbsp; These vibrations emit from my center EXTREMELY fast, yet with a warm glow like feeling.&nbsp; Anyways, I was kinda freaked out at first so I started fighting the trance like state by opening my eyes.&nbsp; This was when I remembered that I was looking to enjoy this and I couldn&#039;t help but to flash back to all the other times I had tripped on mushrooms or acid.&nbsp; Then, all of a sudden, this knowledge comes over me and I knew that all those experiences in the past were just preparing me for this moment.&nbsp; So tripping balls, I re-close my eyes.<br /><br />Upon doing so I saw the most beautiful entity of all.&nbsp; It was definitely female or at least she had that presence of it.&nbsp; She had six arms and was swaying to the music I had chosen for myself (Animus Vox - Glitch Mob).&nbsp; She was sitting cross legged over a stone slab and on the slab was the most intricate lines that where changing constantly.&nbsp; As I sat there I had MANY thoughts RAPIDLY shoot through my brain.&nbsp; I was thankful for the music because it was almost a reference to my reality/time.<br /><br />After enjoying her dance and me trying so hard to understand what it is I am seeing, I knew I was starting to come down.&nbsp; Longing to stay with the entity longer I just laid there with my eyes closed, literally laughing out loud and thanking her for such an amazing experience.&nbsp; This was my first experience with DMT.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a lot of visuals I can&#039;t really describe, because they go extremely fast.&nbsp; It seems we only remember the last little bit of it because like someone posted earlier, it is almost like our body treats the trip as a dream.<br /><br />This experience is not a breakthrough, although I felt it was when I did it, it really carried no meaning to me.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t until my 4-5th time I had a breakthrough and let’s just say I had a conversation with an inner entity through thoughts alone, meanwhile he was showing me shapes and designs that would appear from his hands in thin air.&nbsp; This was all with my eyes closed (friends told me) and I would have sworn they were open because I was THERE.<br /><br />I am sure I sound crazy, but I can assure you I am not.&nbsp; I am about to graduate University with a bachelor&#039;s in CIS and I consider myself a very down to earth person.&nbsp; In fact before my experiences with DMT I was Agnostic if not an Atheist.&nbsp; Soon after, my experiences I knew something was changing inside me.&nbsp; Every time I came back I knew that this place I perceived was something more than just a hallucination.&nbsp; It’s almost like that movie Inception, once I was awoken to this dimension, I have desired nothing more than to return again. <br /><br />I keep meaning to type up my next couple trips but it seems the first one is the most vivid in my head.&nbsp; I think it is because the changa had MAIO&#039;s, which allows for a longer, more memorable trip.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />All in all DMT is EXTREMELY powerful stuff.&nbsp; Even in the smallest doses, it can be the strongest trip you will ever experience.&nbsp; Although it is overpowering, it can be a very beautiful and spiritual adventure if you just let go and accept you have no control.&nbsp; I always look for an entity, there is always one somewhere, sometimes even hiding, but they are there to guide you through and show you the most beautiful things.&nbsp; I have never had a bad trip but I think you honestly have to be an evil hearted person to experience one.&nbsp; DMT shows you what you need to be shown, that&#039;s at least my take on it.<br /><br />Well I have wasted enough time re writing my 1st trip report LMAO, none the less I hope you all enjoyed my experience.&nbsp; If anybody has any questions please PM me.&nbsp; I LOVE to share in people’s thoughts and experiences.<br /><br />Sometimes we understand more, when we understand nothing at all.<br />

Sitting there, being completely certain that life and death were the same thing, and that God without a doubt existed (quite a bold realization for an atheist), this was too much for me and I concluded these realizations were mistakes my mind made while under the influence of a drug. It&#039;s been almost 4 years now and I haven&#039;t touched DMT.

I&#039;m thinking of ordering a gram from and smoking 200mg of changa, which I think is about 60mg of DMT, or a third of however much I smoke. Sounds like you had an amazing trip! What would you call a breakthrough?

				I have yet to make it to the breakthrough, but I&#039;m trying again real soon! Interesting stuff, but I just can&#039;t get the smoking down, probably because I was using an oil burner and they kind of suck for DMT. Hope you had an amazing trip through hyperspace.

				I&#039;d say my first pack was about about half a gram of changa.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t smoke it all, and it was more than enough.&nbsp; I consider a break through something you take back from the experience.&nbsp; Something you learn and changes you for the better.&nbsp; Everybody&#039;s experiences are different so i can&#039;t give you a specific answer but, you&#039;ll know when you get there =P<br /><br />Edawg420

				Here is how i smoke the pure crystals now:<br /><br />I have a steam roller dedicated to DMT smoking only<br /><br />I place a small amount of finely ground cannabis at the bottom<br /><br />I then weigh out .05 grams of pure DMT<br /><br />I crush it up to i fine powder<br /><br />Sprinkle the power on top of the cannabis, trying to keep it centered.<br /><br />Then i place a small layer of finely ground cannabis on top of the dmt, just enough so i can only see weed<br /><br />Then i very gently light the entire bowl, usning as little flame as i can.&nbsp; make sure the entire top part is cherried.<br /><br />Slowly pull the smoke through as to not create to much heat<br /><br />If you do it this way... i guarantee you can&#039;t fuck it up, just add more if you wanna go farther too BTW. <br /><br />Most i have done was .1 Grams

When I used to smoke, I used my own little device which worked very well:<br />&nbsp;<br />You know the thin glass stems with stainless steel or copper scrubbers (to act as heatsinks) commonly used by people who smoke crack?<br />Well, I had one of them at hand&nbsp; ::) and attached one to the mouthpiece of my bubbler (made one with an erlenmeyer and a rubber stopper with 2 holes in it) by means of a rubber connector. <br />I loaded the DMT on the top (holding the stem thin side down) of the scrubber, and feathered it with my torch to make the crystals liquid and stick to the mesh. Then I attached this crack pipe to the bubbler setup and hit. Very smooth smoke. 50mg did the trick every time. Went down as low as 30mg I remember, but those experiences were less extravagant.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;
