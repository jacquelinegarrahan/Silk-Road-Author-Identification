				Don&#039;t worry it takes about 2-3 hours. From my own research I found that the transaction needs to be confirmed 6 times by the network before it will show up @ SR. SR also runs the transaction through tumblers which cause a delay as well I think.

				I&#039;ve had some random Aurora crashes as well.<br />Though I wouldn&#039;t necessarily be using TOR to access MTGOX and places like that...
