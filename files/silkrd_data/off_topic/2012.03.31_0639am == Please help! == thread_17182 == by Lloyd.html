				Good morning everyone,<br /><br />As most of you should know, i&#039;m new to SR. After many hours of searching through the internet I finally found an article that held the answer to what I had been looking so hard for! I immediately downloaded TOR and accessed Silk Road for the first time. I wasn&#039;t sure if this whole website was a setup of some sort so I was a bit skeptical. After countless hours on this forum and the Silk Road website I read many reviews and threads and was finally convinced that this is a genuine online black market and was so happy that no words could explain!<br /><br />On Monday I transferred money to Get-Bitcoin.com to purchase my first Bitcoins. 6 days later they email me back telling me that the payment has been confirmed but due to a $50.00 transfer fee from the banks (either theirs or mine or both?) I was short on money to complete the order. I went to the website and created another order with the correct amount as they told me to do, the only problem is, I am now +-5 BTC short to make my first order on SR.<br /><br />I had specifically sent through more money than the amount of Bitcoins I needed to also cover the cost of the transfer fee and any other processing fee&#039;s that Get-Bitcoin.com might have charged. Little did I know the transfer fees alone were a lot more than I expected and now I am short on BTC!<br /><br />I am so excited to make my first purchase and I don&#039;t want to have to go through another week of waiting for $50.00 to clear to get my full Bitcoins as it is already Saturday and they will only do the transfer on Monday morning and I will end up waiting another 6 days before I can make this purchase.<br /><br />I know that many of you will know exactly what I have been feeling and the anticipation that I have just to get my Bitcoins! I&#039;m sure you all went through it when you were making your first BTC deposit. I have read many threads on the forum and I see that SR has a very unique community that is always willing to help out!<br /><br />So what I am asking is that someone will help me out and donate some Bitcoins to me temporarily. As soon as i get more BTC i will transfer the money back. Even if you can only send me 1 BTC i will more than appreciate it and I will keep track of the users who send me the BTC so I can send them back as soon as I get more. I will REALLY appreciate any help!!!!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Lloyd

				Lloyd: I&#039;m sorry you&#039;re going through this, and yes, many of us have had problems with bitcoins, just to get going here, and know just how nerve wracking it can be.&nbsp; And if you&#039;ve read a bit, which I&#039;m sure you have, you know that we often help each other out, when we find we are less than 1 btc short of making our purchase.&nbsp; But of course it helps to have been here a while, so people can get to know you.&nbsp; Just in case, I want to make sure you know the quick way most of us get a few btc, if we&#039;re in a hurry:<br /><br />You can get bitcoins a *lot* quicker than you&#039;ve been told...less than an hour, usually: What I would suggest is that you go to the main site, under &#039;Money&#039;, and look up one of our local vendors.&nbsp; You can read here in the forums who is reliable: I&#039;ve personally bought btc from btc King and btc Buddy, they both are very fast.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also heard that Sugar Mama is also very fast.&nbsp; So it won&#039;t take days, more likely an hour or less. <br /><br />You can do a quick bank deposit with btc King or just trot down to a RiteAid and buy a moneypak to go with btc Buddy or Sugar Mama.&nbsp; Might as well get used to this: it happens.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hi guys,<br /><br />The reason why it cost so much for the transfer was because I am in a small country in Africa and the transfer to the BoA is expensive. There won&#039;t be any way that I can purchase these coins today because Western Union in my country doesn&#039;t allow us to send money out of the country - only to someone else in our own country.<br /><br />Look, all im asking if for 1BTC from a few different people so even if i am a scammer you&#039;re not risking that much - +-$4.80. But I am not a scammer! I plan on doing a lot of business on SR and I just want to make my purchase today so it can go out first thing on Monday morning.<br /><br />I have been on this forum for a short while and have already designed a logo for PaythePiper and he was very happy with it. I am in the process of designing a hologram for Moon Unit and im helping out The1one00 with his blog and a logo. I am an honest person and I swear that I do not want to scam anyone. Thanks for your time!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Lloyd

				No, I don&#039;t believe you. I think you are trying to scam coins out of kind hearted and good natured people, who work for their own money.<br /><br />If it wasn&#039;t a very rude thing to do, I would tell you to simple fuck off and die, but like I said, that is rude so i won&#039;t say it.

				Fair enough buddy, if others are prepared to instill trust in you so be it. It is, of course, none of my business!<br /><br />If I offended you with my FUCK OFF AND DIE remark, then with no sarcasm, I sincerely offer you half an apology.

				No worries mate! I was only offended a bit by the fact that I came here to look for help regarding my Bitcoins and didn&#039;t expect to have posts like that from members of the SR community. I have been through countless threads on this forum since I joined and I have seen that SR is full of people who are just like me! I have seen by the way people talk on this forum, how they present themselves on the internet and I can see that people here are ordinary people just like me.<br /><br />I am going to be a member of this forum for a LONG time as well as the SR website as a buyer and may even become a seller in the future where I will start selling Cannabis that has originated from Africa such as Durban Poison and Malawi Gold.<br /><br />One of the guys I&#039;m designing a logo for has kindly donated another 2 BTC to me! Thank you! Now I only need 2 more ;) And I will have successfully made my first purchase!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Lloyd

				Lloyd came thru, paid back the bitcoin I borrowed.&nbsp; This is a good guy, not trying to do anything but make a go of things here on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been ripped twice.&nbsp; Both times on heroin.&nbsp; I remember a log time ago, a couple of hard case junkies telling me you do get ripped once in a while: you don&#039;t want to be sick, and will trust your money...but I try to be trusting on small stuff like this, as I&#039;ve seen some pretty miserable motherfuckers in my day, not trusting anybody, always thinking everybody is out to get them...I think it&#039;s better to be a bit trusting, in this world, than not, even if it means loosing a few bucks now and then.&nbsp; Drug world can be hard.<br /><br />Thanks Lloyd, I got the btc you sent...best wishes...
