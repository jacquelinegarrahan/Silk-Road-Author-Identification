				I&#039;m curious as to everybody&#039;s experiences, but in particular I&#039;m wondering if there is anyone here involved with athletics at a highly competitive level?<br /><br />I ask because I want to know about your experiences with physical activity on various drugs. Clearly there are some drugs that cannot or should not be mixed with exercise, but at the same time I&#039;ve had some positive and interesting experiences on LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, and of course weed.&nbsp; <br /><br />For instance, I took MDMA one morning a few months ago, around .2 of some stuff from Pfandleiher, and went out to a nearby field right as I was peaking.&nbsp; I felt warmed up almost instantly, whereas normally I need about 15-20 minutes, and from the first second I started sprinting I could tell there was some serious performance enhancement going on.&nbsp; I am normally the fastest guy on any given field, but I swear I was moving 10% faster than I ever have before (people watching from their apartment balconies were freaking out and cheering, no lie!).&nbsp; I was very careful, taking about a minute break between my sprints, but the entire time I felt absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />LSD and mushrooms can be conducive to physical activity too, but they are more tricky I&#039;ve found.&nbsp; Highly aerobic activity too close to the peak can cause dizziness and all around unpleasant times in my experience.&nbsp; My best results have come if I wait until maybe T+6:00, at which point I&#039;ve noticed my stamina is fantastic and I can run for hours on end with little fatigue.&nbsp; As for more strength-based activity, I&#039;ve climbed some very tall trees while peaking on an 8th+ of mushrooms and felt no negative effects whatsoever (one of the most beautiful experiences of my life).<br /><br />Anybody else do stuff like this?<br />

				MDMA and other amphetamines are stimulants, so they&#039;ll raise your heart rate. Adderall is made up of amphetamines; those nitric oxide pre-workout supplements like Jack3d as well as ephedrine, meth, etc. will all raise your heart rate and make you feel warmed-up. You should learn about resting heart rate and target heart rate while exercising. Be very careful in taking stimulants then exercising and make sure you don&#039;t have a heart attack.

				i almost have my 6 pack completed.&nbsp; I workout with weights and cardio everyday.<br /><br />I&nbsp; love working out and cardio as high as i can be on marijuana.&nbsp; I feel as if i can go longer&nbsp; and last longer.&nbsp; more endurance and motivation per say.&nbsp; <br /><br />\I have done abs on mushrooms,&nbsp; that worked out fine.

				The ritual is to go for a run the day after a night out on mdma. For some reason (I&#039;m guessing traces left in the body) the elevated hr leads to a bonus high&nbsp; ;)

				I can lift relentlessly high on bud. The tunnel vision you get and your fatigue is dampened from being stoned. Best workouts ever, the only downside is you get a little goofy.
