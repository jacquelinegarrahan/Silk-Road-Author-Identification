				Dealer next door to me pays £200 an ounce, sells at 1.4g for £20bag so yea that would be a £400 return (£200 profit). Cannabis in the UK really is extortionate, i hear there is a guy selling Thai at £120 locally so i may have to see if i can source some.

				UK Outdoor grown weed would be fucking awful and the prices people mention are fucking shocking.<br /><br />As a grower I dont have to pay these prices fortunately. And there was me worrying because the one guy that i sell eighths to, i charge £25 for 3.5 grams. So by the sound if it he is doing fine out of the deal.

				Actually thats a point i never considered, surely there are very few outdoor gorilla grows in the UK ? i always assumed almost all UK grown bud was going to be indoor hydro set ups ? maybe down south (devon, Cornwall way) you mite be able to get a cheeky outdoor grow but generally i imagine its not really done ?

				Savvy UK gorillas are turning to Denmark for their seeds, the Danes are at higher latitudes than UK and have similar weather, yet can finish some blinding crops.<br /><br />&nbsp;Check Zen seeds on clearnet

				I am suprised ! pleased tough =) but the fact it is at the same price is insane, outdoor amnesia cost me 8 euros a gram in Amsterdam last week.<br /><br />However as for cheap weed had a bit of luck yesterday. My mate went out on wednesday night, and while rat arsed a friend of his said he had got some weed for free (apparently he knew a guy who needed to offload all his weed really quick due to shutting down a grow house), but as he didn&#039;t smoke he was giving it to another friend for free. After looking at a picture my friend (being blindo drunk and having no idea what he was really buying) offered him £30 for it and it was a deal. <br /><br />So yesterday my mate goes to pick up this stock, comes back with this beautiful smelling, trichrome covered tub of weed. Ok it wasn&#039;t manicured well, but it was dry enough aka not damp (still really sticky to touch) but then i put it on the scales, weighed in at 7.89g.......for £30 ! We were well chuffed and when we rolled up a zoot we were not disappointed, probably an indica dominant hybrid (70/30ish if i had to guess :S).<br /><br />tldr; Weed off mates ftw

				Growing in the U.K. indoor or outdoor seems like quite the challenge from this side of the pond ;D. I guess around me there is the benefit of space. You can drive about an hour from me and be no where on your own parcel of land. The trade off is that we really only have a one lovely grow season followed by a brutal winter.<br />Better light up inside and stay warm :D<br /><br />-Cheers
