				Hello my fellow roaders...<br />For the past few months I have been buying/selling here on SR, slowly building up some money. I recently had to cash out every penny due to some drama IRL. I have never in my life been so broke and need to get back on my feet. I need $250 USD to make a purchase.. I will X4 that initial investment and be back on track.. I know it is a large investment and I will probably not get any help here, but its still nice to vent.. It kills me to turn away money on an hourly basis due to lack of product. I would be more than willing to pay back with interest. So if anyone would be willing to help me build this empire, I am no scammer and like to sell happiness..<br /><br />Total transactions: 68<br />Total spent: $13618.47<br />Refund rate: 0.48%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0.87%<br />Member for: 4 months<br />

				It is possible you&#039;re just a troll/scammer, but there are certainly situations in which decent people get a cash flow problem, especially when they&#039;re young people with no disposable income like many are these days thanks to the economic climate. Here are some ideas for using your brain to obtain $$$, maybe they will help somebody here.<br /><br />In your position, if it is legitimate and since you can&#039;t post collateral, you need to google for a &quot;microfinance loan&quot; in your geographical region. I am sure there&#039;s something in your city or state. Anybody can get one of these loans without collateral because that is the point of microfinance, but you&#039;ll need to jump through a couple of hoops first and the rate of interest is rather steep. However, this is the best possible alternative to using a loan shark or payday loan, or worse still, your credit card.<br /><br />Alternatively, if you live in a western country and in a city you could work for the money while feeding yourself at the same time by doing &quot;mystery shopping&quot;. Again, google is your friend. This is slower, you&#039;ll only get $10 or $20 per day but you don&#039;t need to spend money to do it since your travel/food costs are usually paid for by the company. Companies are always looking for mystery shoppers because its hard to get decent ones who can pay attention to details, have flexible amounts of time on their hands, and do a lot of boring form filling. But at the end of the day you get paid to eat at mealtimes or buy things.<br /><br />Alternatively, you could sign up for medical trials at your local hospitals or universities (use VOIP to reduce phone bills), you can get paid much more for this compared with mystery shopping, but you&#039;ll have to be available for longer periods/possibly experience discomfort of some kind.<br /><br />Normally I&#039;d just say: get a job. But in many parts of the West today that is almost impossible unfortunately with well over 75% youth unemployment in many areas even though the official statistics (lies) say it is lower. The best route for many young people today is going to be to think laterally by obtaining a job on the black market, because that&#039;s the only market segment I can think of with growth outside of scale gas in certain parts of the states. Remember that it is never acceptable to use violence to obtain money, even on the black market despite people&#039;s misconceptions about our world. The best way to obtain capital is to produce a product or service, because then you get repeat business over time and can build up. It doesn&#039;t matter what market you&#039;re in, you have to use your brain all the same. That doesn&#039;t mean obeying the rules, but it doesn&#039;t mean breaking them all either.

				Pfand&#039;s mdma.<br /><br />I have 50 in sr now. 250 more will get me the 10 gram. I sale for $100 a G locally, and it sales out in a week or less. <br /><br />Before having to unload my profits in real life I had reinvested in a few of Afterhour&#039;s Rolex pills, and hope they show up soon. <br /><br />One of my problems is this..&nbsp; <br />When I make enough to re-up, I have to place an order and am out of product for a few weeks, constantly turning people and their money away. If I could get the 10 grams on the way while I am unloading the rolex, I would have my cycle down if that makes sense. No dry spells.. <br /><br />Either way, I have spent the weekend gathering items I could maybe pawn.. Now its Monday, so after the postman makes his rounds.. its off to the pawnbrokers to get financially raped hahaha.
