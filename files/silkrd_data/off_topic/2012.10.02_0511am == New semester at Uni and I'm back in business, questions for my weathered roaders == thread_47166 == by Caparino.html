				No lie Caparino, I recieved some of Liquid 25i, AJAPAI. Real deal stuff, I have tried a good amount of blotters. From Duderugs to Foxy to Hard Hustle to Gaffy, EVEN TYLER Snortables. AJAPAI is the best by far 2 drop under the tongue gone. I mean literally tripping HARD CORE.&nbsp; This was Rated at 1000ug. People raged on him in the thread about non orally active, and about how he was wrong. No, that info was false. After experincing that, man that was some amazing stuff, I would have to say if not the best trip of my life, one of top 3. AJAPAI stuff will not dissapoint.

				If your trying to turn a profit then heroin in your friend.<br /><br />However, for actual fun drugs I&#039;d say go with MDMA and 2c-x drugs.<br />BTW, 2c-x can be taken in a liquid form under the tongue.

				Caparino, a lot of people enjoy NBOMe&#039;s. They are really cheap. The best way to dose is on your upper gum. I&#039;d personally sell 25C-NBOMe. There&#039;s just a lot of talk about the safety of these drugs though so it&#039;s ultimately up to you. Definitely sell some MDMA though. DOC seems to be the most enjoyable and shortest trip of the DOx compounds.<br /><br />If you were to sell 2C-X, I think 2C-B would be the best choice. It seems to have the least body load (if any), plenty of visuals but not a lot of mindfuck. People love mixing them with MDMA so you could upsell it when you sell your MDMA. :)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36654 Official NBOMe thread

				Hmm, I&#039;ll keep it mind when the winter festivals come to town TheAbsurd thanks even though my topic said no gumming :D<br /><br />Ian, buddy, holy crap that&#039;s amazing news there. I can sell it along with my acid blotters as insurance in-case someone wants to escape from or mellow out their trip.

				WARN THEM.<br /><br />Dont let someone take 3-4 xanax blotters, this is bad. Especially dangerous if you happen to be giving out fentenyl blotters too (which would probably do quite well too)<br /><br />Also, 2c-i has come in blotter form.
