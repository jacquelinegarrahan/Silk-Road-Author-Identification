				So I need a little advice today guys. I had recent altercation last night that has left me completely broke. My dealer/ &quot;good friend&quot; robbed me of $6500, just about everything I had. I&#039;ve known this guy for 3 years and have done steady business ever since. Buying close to a pound or two of high quality weed almost everyday. I&#039;m pretty much still in a state of confusion. What should i do? I know where he and his dealer lives, but I have no idea what I should do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

				Take a deep breath, don&#039;t do anything for a few days, rash decisions usually have unpleasant outcomes. I&#039;m very rarely pro-narc, but if he really fucked you that bad you may want to leave LE an anonymous tip and get them some prison time, though if you go this route, make sure that they don&#039;t have people to &quot;visit&quot; you.

				What else is there except to bust a cap in their ass? I mean, isn&#039;t that just the basic, obvious option?

				Well, shit. I&#039;d imagine if I were in that situation, I&#039;d confront them about it, and if they didn&#039;t offer any reimbursement, I&#039;d discontinue relations with them. I certainly wouldn&#039;t want them to come after me (ie, be afraid enough that I might tell that they kill me), but I&#039;d avoid them like the plague from then on.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know how that would work; all the drug dealers I deal with are on here for a specific reason: staying anonymous (and far away) means it&#039;s very difficult for them to come and &quot;get&quot; me...

				From a former dealer that was on about your same level.&nbsp; First off I never really condone violence but I did find at certain points in my career it was needed and I always hated doing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got screwed several times for about the same amount and I would all ways start off by trying to talk to them and see what happen.&nbsp; A time or two it was just a simple delay that ended up not screwing me.&nbsp; One time a guy had to ditch the product to avoid a Leo, I quizzed him over and over to make sure his story staid the same.&nbsp; Ended up believing him and just ate the loss, and he never screwed me again.&nbsp; On two occasions person in question just keep avoiding me.&nbsp; I let this go on for a few days calling every day several times a day.&nbsp; At this point I know this guy just fucked me so I called up a few of my boys.&nbsp; Gave them a bit of free product and told them what had happen and sent them on their way.&nbsp; First time got all my cash back same day, I never asked what they had to do to get it, didn&#039;t really want to know.&nbsp; The second time I was brought an entire house of furniture, with few electronics and such.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t really happy about it since first off I had to get rid off it all and secondly it wasn&#039;t worth even a quarter of what I was owed.&nbsp; Never delt with either of those guys again and I destroyed the reps around town.&nbsp; But that said after I got that all the house hold stuff I never had anyone screw me over again.&nbsp; Other than the cops who knocked on my door about 2 yrs later.<br /><br />So if this guys is avoiding you and there&#039;s no good reason for it other than he screwed you then call up a few of your boys to go pay him a visit.&nbsp; But first do try and contact him and see if something out of his control did happen.<br /><br />Best of luck

				I am by no means a narc! So that is out the question. But this guy did get caught transporting 9lbs several weeks earlier in another state, so hes probably going to jail here soon. <br /><br />He was confronted by two others that buys from him and he told them &quot;I needed money, but I still got you on the LOW.&quot;

				Well if he got busted and he is half way smart he used your money for an attorney which will keep him out of jail for at least a year or two in which you should be able to get your money back.&nbsp; Now another issue is that if he got busted I would just right it off and stay the f away from him.&nbsp; You dont want him dropping your names to the cops to help his case.
