				Chasezip2201, you could put a contract for yourself over tor. Do homework to find an actual guy. Code instructions for it. When you call your lawyer you actually call your trusted friend. Speak in code. Keep it short. He sends out the actual contract. Assassin comes and injures you. Claim witness protection / federal protective services etc. Even better if you were in a cell at the time.
