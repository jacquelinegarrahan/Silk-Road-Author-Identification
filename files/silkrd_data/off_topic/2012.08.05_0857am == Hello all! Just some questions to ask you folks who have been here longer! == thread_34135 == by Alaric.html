				So I am pretty knew to this whole thing and I am kind of overwhelmed by all the things I have found and seen that I want. I saw the introduction thread but wanted to ask some actual questions as well in a more open area. If there is a thread I missed sorry just thought I would ask for a little guidance.<br /><br />1. How much is 1 bitcoin in USD? (I am sure this is something obvious and I am missing a link somewhere but still.)<br /><br />2. Is the Silk Road anonymous or are there certain programs I need to install/run while purchasing?<br /><br />3. What are some of these terms I see in the psychedelics section. I am familiar with a tab and a strip and a sheet but what is ug? EG LSD 50 x Blotters @ 250ug does that 50 mean tabs?<br /><br />4. What is the purchasing process like. What is escrow and such etc.<br /><br />5. What are some other things that I NEED to know before starting? <br /><br />I really appreciate any help and apologize if I have missed something that tells me all these things.

				i&#039;ve been here six months but i&#039;m still a newb at some things, i&#039;ll try to answer some of your questions the best i can, since no one else has<br /><br />1. the rate changes all the time. i think you can see what the current rate is at https://mtgox.com/<br /><br />2. the silk road is anonymous but to further protect your anonyminity you should encrypt your messages/addresses with pgp... which is really something i need to learn how to do already. &gt;.&gt;<br /><br />3. ug (micrograms) is the unit of measurement used to measure lsd. iirc, there are one million micrograms in a gram. <br /><br />4. escrow is where your money goes when you make a payment. it&#039;s not yet in the vendors account and not in yours. if you finalize, it&#039;s no longer in escrow.<br /><br />5. make your first purchases from someone with a solid reputation (fans, sales, feedback). you&#039;ll probably be asked to finalize early for your first few purchases, you shouldn&#039;t have to but it can be hard to avoid as a new member. <br /><br />6. don&#039;t beg people on the forums for bitcoins. <br /><br />good luck xoxo
