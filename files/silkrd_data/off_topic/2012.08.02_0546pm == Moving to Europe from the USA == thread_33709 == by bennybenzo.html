				What up everybody!<br />I was planning on going to Europeanunion and probably staying there for good. <br />Only thing is&nbsp; i hear and read that it is someewhat hard for us citizens to get work permits or residency over there. i know there is loop holes to it and possiblle chances of you being able to actually be granted a work permit or residency, you never know till you try. and if you cant im sure there are always what people call &#039;&#039;shit jobs&#039;&#039; or in other words labor jobs were euros hire americans= house cleaning etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />but does any1 know of ways to do this? I really need to get the fuck out of here! :( really do.&nbsp; I have $ saved but i dont have any degrees in school yet and have been unplugged from the system/matrix since 9th grade, i am old enough and intelligent enough to survive on my own as i have been since day one with out a doubt.&nbsp; I lived the hard life since a kid but i choose to be unplugged. fuck the system/matrix.<br /><br /><br />Any advice yall? <br /><br />Lots of thanks!

				I lived &quot;Off the Radar&quot; for a few years and then found it really hard to get a bank account again. They had really tightened up the anti-fraud protection rules (this was back in 2001). I had enough ID to prove who I was, I just found it hard proving where I lived without payslips, utility bills, previous bank statements, college enrolment forms etc. All of which had to be from the last few months or they&#039;d be too old. In the end I used the electoral register to prove my residence.<br /><br />What work would you be happy doing? It&#039;s really hard to get a job in some EU countries at the moment. :&#039;(<br /><br />Anyway, I wish you good luck on this new chapter in your life.:)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, I think it would be very hard to find meaningful work in any european country in these times, especially without a college title. And don&#039;t think the freedom will be very much greater there than here in the US, things are getting worse all over the globe.<br /><br />BB

				Most of europe is like ethiopia so if you know how to grow your own foods it would help because europeanites dont have a lot of access to clean water.

				<br /><br />The way most people do it is to get a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate and get a teaching job in a language school in one of the non-English speaking countries. You can gain the TEFL cert in 6 - 8 weeks and it&#039;s a passport to the world.

				Unless you have a college degree in something useful, it&#039;s not going to happen.&nbsp; You should also know that the economic situation over there is also in much worse shape than it is here.&nbsp; Immigrating to a new country without a job offer, a skill or trade, or family is a disaster waiting to happen.<br /><br />If you really want to move to Europe, get a degree, get a job with a multinational corporation, and then after a few years of experience either transfer to a European office or hire a head-hunter to help you find work in Europe.

				I retired here in Europe after having had enough of the rat race in the States.&nbsp; That was about twenty years ago.&nbsp; I really love it over here.&nbsp; But, if you don&#039;t know the language, don&#039;t have any relatives, don&#039;t have any friends to connect with, it&#039;ll be real difficult.&nbsp; I had extended family that gave me some help.&nbsp; Unemployment in most European Countries is about twice what it is in the States.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard for Europeans to find jobs.&nbsp; Of course there are always the crap jobs that go mostly to foreigners but, then you work like a slave and usually get paid less.&nbsp; There&#039;s hard times all over.&nbsp; <br /><br />What country are you wanting to retire in?
