				There is a vendor that is considering adding some Atlantis truffles to his listings. Check out Vice&#039;s documentary on the psychedelic truffle on youtube, if you are uninformed about these delicacies as I was. Also, if anyone has tried &#039;em, I wouldn&#039;t mind hearing some feedback. Is 15g a one person trip or could two people trip good with splitting it? Is it almost identical to a typical cubensis trip?

				Hi, I think it is a good idea, but they have to be in a fresh place and they don&#039;t last as much as shrooms, so maybe it is more complicated for you.<br />The trip is really similar to a cubensis trip, since the active substance in shrooms is the same than in truffles (psylocibin and psylocin), but I haven&#039;t tried truffles as much to compare them with cubensis.<br />15 gr is a one person trip, or two very very soft trips.<br /><br />Edit: I think this post fits better in product offers forum.

				Yeah, I suppose you&#039;re right. I put it in here because I&#039;m technically not offering anything. <br /><br />I figured the trip was relatively the same. I wasn&#039;t sure if they were more or less intense, etc...
