				Before you worry I am going to dose someone who doesn&#039;t see it coming, that isn&#039;t why I am asking. I am just curious if any of you have experience putting LSD in tea or orange juice etc and waiting for the trip to come on. I remember hearing a story of how Grace Slick wanted to slip some in Nixon&#039;s tea but the Secret Service didn&#039;t allow her in the White House. Any experience?

				Yes, LSD is soluble in water and alcohol... though alcohol dissolves it quicker.&nbsp; ;)<br />Depending on your reason for dosing this person, I would be wary, you could cause them to go off their rocker.<br />There was a village in the 50&#039;s that the CIA dosed with LSD without their knowledge.&nbsp; Many people saw crazy things, and nobody knew what was happening.&nbsp; Two or three individuals in the village had to be hospitalized, permanently.<br />Psychedelics are fun, but only if you know you&#039;re going there.<br />Just like falling accidentally freaks you out, but going on one of those extreme-drop rides is fun.

				on a side note making &quot;mushroom tea&quot; with psychedilic mushrooms will make the effects hit much faster, and peak almost immediately opposed to just eating them regular way..&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;blending them in orange juice would probly work too.

				Second on the mushroom tea, imagine sipping on it, sitting outside on a wonderful day. It&#039;s amazing. It&#039;s probably the only way I take mushrooms now, otherwise I get nausea like shit, but maybe that&#039;s cause I always seem to eat a little bit before the trip.

				I&#039;ve put it in just about everything and it&#039;s been fine, though I haven&#039;t put it in freshly boiled water, just in tea or coffee with milk added that has had a few minutes to cool off a bit.

				Never done it myself, but I have seen people doing it. Pouring drops of LSD into a bottle of water then drinking it. <br />If you use a transparent bottle be careful that sunlight can destroy LSD (so says Wikipedia). I don&#039;t know how fast, but you should probably not leave the bottle in the sunlight for a whole day or so.
