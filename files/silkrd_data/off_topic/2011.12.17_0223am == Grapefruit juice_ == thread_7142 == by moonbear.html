				I&#039;ve heard that grapefruit juice intensifies the effects of drugs. This may just be a rumor but I was wondering if it was true?

				white grapefruit juice contains quinine which is supposed to be synergistic when taken with opiates... somebody else will probably be able to give you the chemical reasons as to why.&nbsp; never heard of it helping with other types of drugs.<br /><br />also tonic water has quinine.&nbsp; i usually try to make a nice cocktail of both if i am about to take some oxy.

				Pink grapefruit juice that is not from concentrate certainly does possess a furanocoumarin compound that actually potentiates a number drugs, which certainly includes opioids . These components inhibit activity (some irreversibly) of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 which is responsible for metabolism of some drugs which will increase the intensity and duration of effects, as well as associate toxicity. Others interact the P-glycoprotein which can cause increased or decreased levels of other drugs in certain tissues. Common recreational drugs affected by grapefruit compounds include: (dihydro)codeine and (hydro and oxy)codone, tramadol, and buprenorphine, but not morphine; benzos like midazolam and diazepam; dextromethorphan; and modafinil<br />For more info you could read (but their list is incomplete): https://secure.pharmacytimes.com/lessons/200303-02.asp<br /><br />I am unfamiliar with white grapefruit, yet quinine is an opiate potentiator reportedly as well.
