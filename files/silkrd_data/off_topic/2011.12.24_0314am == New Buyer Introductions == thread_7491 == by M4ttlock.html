				Hello SR community, My name is M4ttlock, both here on the forums and on SR. I haven&#039;t found a topic like this yet and figured it might be worth while to us new buyers. I fully understand why a new buyer is looked down upon and viewed as a potential scammer. I feel lucky to have found this community and am glad to be getting my feet wet. i hope to have my first order en route by the end of the weekend. already got me some BTCs in my SR account&nbsp; 8) So, With this thread i figure lets give some space to our New buyers, who are not scammers or assholes trying to rip people off, with some space to introduce themselves and get some exposure so they can feel&nbsp; accepted. I&#039;ll Start.<br /><br />My name/handle is M4ttlock. I am back on the eastcoast and looking getting myself back together after some rough spots over the last few years. I am a humble Buddhist who has done his share of &quot;mind expanding&quot;. now in the dull little town i live in i have been blessed to find this community so that i may be able to get some good product where it is virtually non existent. i hope to become a strong proud member of this community getting quality things and supporting reliable people with their trades. i plan to visit these forums often and give as much feedback as i can to everyone i interact with. So far all i can say is that BTCBuddy is awesome, got my BTCs to me in under an hour and for a first time user it saves the hassle of figuring out Ewallets or whatever and going through hoops. <br /><br />I hope this sparks a trend with fellow serious new buyers. Peace.<br /><br />M4ttlock
