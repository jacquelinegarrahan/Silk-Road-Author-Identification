				Its just dawned on me how busy these forums are right now, almost every section is constantly buzzing and I dont actually know of any other forums where each section is always as consistently busy as the Silk Road forums and thats not taken into account all the views, its just the actual posts, I mean correct me if I&#039;m wrong but I&#039;d go as far as saying these are the most popular forums anywhere in the world right now.<br /><br />It just goes to show, us druggies can type and spell and thingz&nbsp; ???<br /><br />

				I would go a step further and propose that the ratio of high-value posts to low-value posts is higher than the average internet forum and that it&#039;s increasing.

				For sure it is not the biggest or biggest forum in the whole internet. I mean if consider the type of people that each one attracts you can get a minor statistic. Here we are all pretty much users of substances. Think about how many would like to be active in forums that consider arts, video games and other type of interests.<br /><br />But in my opinion those forums are by far the best went it comes to the quality of the discussions and the forum users. I always liked to be part in different forums, but since I met the SR forums my whole life has literally changed. For sure, through these forums I learned a lot and bought some substances that helped a lot in this phase of my life, but nevertheless being active in discussions and reading some amazing post and threads had a massive effect on my general view of the world and myself.<br /><br />We learn a lot through SR forums, it has lots of amazing information about almost everything and most of all the users here are really open minded. That&#039;s one of the reasons I am in love with the forum and feel like belonging to a family. <br /><br />Everybody has few turning points in his life like traveling to a new place, college etc. One of mine is when I joined here. The is significant difference in life before and after SR! <br /><br />I will be here around as long as the forum is up and running! <br /><br />Always yours,<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />EDIT: I found a list in wiki about forums. Wow.<br />---CLEARNET LINK-----<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_forums<br />

Onto overdosing.<br />Well you can OD on water, something that you need to live. Going without it or having to much of it will certianly change your state of mind and have negative or positive health affects, therefore even water is a drug as well. Same for food.<br />Almost everything is a drug, it does some sort of chemical reaction in our brains or does something to our bodies.<br />There are just certian categories of drugs, ones that you need to live (water &amp; food), ones you choose to take to alter your state of mind (LSD, Meth, Cocaine etc..), and ones you take to improve your health because we are shitty biological organisms that break down.

				Been on a couple of forums to do with drugs and hate when it hits about 3AM my time while up on coke because they tend to die and then it&#039;s almost panic station because any other forums opened at the same time are well gone to bed by that time.<br /><br />Have to say, I&#039;ve been on a busier forum to do with drugs but it wouldn&#039;t have been as hidden as Silk Road or it&#039;s related forum so maybe had a lot more users. The road is growing and so is it&#039;s forum so onwards and upwards!<br />
