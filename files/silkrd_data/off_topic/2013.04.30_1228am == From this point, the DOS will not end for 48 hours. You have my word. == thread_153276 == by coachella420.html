				To DoS an onion requires either flaws in the web server, or flooding it with traffic. The problem with preventing a DoS on tor, is that you cannot block IP&#039;s in any way. The network is much smaller than the internet, so a smaller attacker can have a much larger affect. The tor circuit that connects you to SR is likely being flooded. The particulars of the tor protocol make this possible, as a new circuit is not created for each new connection, to prevent certain types of attacks that attempt to find the IP of the hidden service.<br /><br />To prevent this will require some work on the tor protocol itself. In a way this is a good thing, as it will strengthen tor in the future. For now, I am not sure what can be done to prevent it or mitigate against it.<br />
