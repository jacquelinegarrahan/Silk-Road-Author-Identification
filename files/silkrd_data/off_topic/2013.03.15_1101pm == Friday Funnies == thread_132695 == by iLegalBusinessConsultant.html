				New York Assemblyman Steve Katz was charged with possession of marijuana during a traffic stop south of Albany. Assemblyman Katz was stopped for driving 80 in a 65 zone just south of the state capitol building. During the traffic stop, the police officer said he smelled marijuana. After a search of the vehicle, a small bag of marijuana was found. Republican Assemblyman Katz is noted for having voted NO on New York&#039;s medical marijuana legislation in 2012.

				One of the new rules being considered in Colorado&#039;s efforts in implementing it&#039;s legalization of recreational marijuana is the ability for employers to fire employees for using marijuana in their personal time. Since marijuana use will be legal for all adults, and it is illegal for an employer to fire or discriminate against an employee who partakes in legal activities in their personal time, some employers have asked for an employment law loophole to be able to fire employees for smoking marijuana recreationally in their personal time. Employers who have joined this effort include, law enforcement, transportation companies, and companies selling marijuana themselves. The marijuana businesses claim that having employees who smoke weed will cause an undue risk to their operations as these employees are more likely to steal product than employees who sell marijuana but who themselves do not smoke it.&nbsp;
