				Go to the most impoverished neighborhood you can find and hold up a sign that says &quot;will suck cock for crack&quot; let me know how it works out.

				If you smoke weed, Just smoke with some new people and ask around. I mean where i live you ask any sketchy dude and he will probably be dealing himself, plus everyone smokes out here so its easy to make friends&nbsp; 8) Ive been approached many times to buy/sell anything from H to a little dime sack so just get out there and never agree to anything before hand. LE is out there too. But why source local when SR is at your service? Prescriptions are one of the top categories with pretty much anything available. Unless your in a sketchy country, then i see that need to go local

				Walking around the hood asking people for drugs or waiting for someone to push them on you is a great way to get ripped off or mugged. I&#039;m not saying you DEFINITELY WILL get mugged because I&#039;ve done this before as well (walked around the poor part of downtown and successfully scored some crack), but it is definitely a risk. Ask people you already know if they know a guy who knows a guy, etc.<br /><br />But the question remains, why would you ever go back to getting drugs from &quot;the streets&quot; if you have access to Silk Road?

				Well when you live in a small town, it&#039;s actually quite easy to find pain killers. You can pretty much ask any old fucker by the lake and get them. We get seasonal stays from all over the country here. :) I love retired military :)

				Just make friends with druggies.<br /><br />It helps if you have drugs to share with them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve met a lot of druggies at bars, headshops, and cannabis-friendly cafes. They usually know where to get what I want.<br />

Pharmaceutical opiates for example are 3 times as expensive on SR as they are on the street for me, except for morphine. I can&#039;t really help you with your question though OP, I have friends that do all kinds of drugs so it&#039;s not so hard to get in tough with a dealer. Some stuff is cheaper and better on SR like MDMA, psychedelics and benzos and you can also get obscure drugs which is why SR is good for me.

				If you are older... go to a bar and bs. if not then college parties or high school parties.&nbsp; If you are not the social type then you basically will just be closed off from anything unless you see some obvious drug user in public and walk up to talk to him lol.&nbsp; Drug trade in my area usually just centers around groups of friends that sell to their friends, friends friends, ect.&nbsp; That being said, make some friends (not to say that you don&#039;t have any) but maybe you are friends with people that are too morally sound or &quot;high class&quot;... It&#039;s hard to say exactly what to do without knowing you or your area (please do not tell me :P), but if you talk to enough people you are bound to find someone that knows someone<br /><br />Hope that helped! Although I doubt it did :/

				I understand the OP&#039;s frustration! For a number of reasons, I don&#039;t dare try and source anything other than weed locally, and it can be incredibly bothersome and frustrating to have no idea how to meet people or find hookups. If it&#039;s painkillers you&#039;re looking for, I&#039;d start with trying to get them legitimately from a doctor. I&#039;d be beyond screwed if I wasn&#039;t getting my pills thru a doctor and a pharmacy, as it would costs a hundred times more to get them any other way.
