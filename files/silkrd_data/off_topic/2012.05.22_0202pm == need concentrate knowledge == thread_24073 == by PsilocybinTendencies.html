				I could just look this up, but you guys probably already have figured everything out already, and probably know exactly what to post without giving me a bunch of shit info I don&#039;t need.<br /><br />I am a very experienced cannabis user. Have smoked for a decade and half and I know weed.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had access to concentrates until now though, and I am intrigued.<br /><br />So... how do you smoke hash? Do you have to get a certain special pipe? What about this budder stuff? Oils? What else is there?<br /><br />Could somebody please explain how they work? If I order oil should I just put a drop or two on a bowlpack?<br /><br />Could somebody give me a THC concentrate crash course?<br /><br />I love you all.

				It&#039;s basically like free-basing THC. There are special bongs you can purchase just for the purpose of smoking budder/hash-oil or you can just coat your weed before you smoke it, although the latter isn&#039;t quite as effective. Meth/Crack pipes work well from what I &#039;hear&#039; *shifty-eyes*

				They make hash pipes you can buy online or at a headshop, for oils and wax I already had a bong and they make special bowls that have a screen, so you would just smoke it like normal, bowl cost me $25 at my headshop.

				Is a hash pipe the same thing as what I see people smoking meth with?<br /><br />If I purchased such a thing, could I also use it for DMT and kill two birds?<br /><br />Should I get one of those super torch crack lighters?<br /><br />So for oils and wax I can just pack it into my normal metal bowl with a normal metal screen and puff away?

				Glass hot knives are what I find work best for oil as well as hash and Budder. I have tried the DMT pipe and it works fine as well but I much prefer a Hot knife.&nbsp; As for concentrates Cannabis Tincture is pretty good stuff as are edibles! Another thing you can do is mix a few drops of oil with a bowl of bud and do ye olde hidden treasure ;)

				Yes get a super torch crack lighter. Lol. If your local smokeshop doesn&#039;t carry them, Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond carries nice torches for cooking crème brûlées. Tasty stuff too haha.<br /><br />DMT/meth/crack pipes work well. They look sketchy or fun, whichever you think. <br />Even a long thin glass tube that can withstand heat will do. (My long vaporization pipe broke, but the lengthy part was still in tact and I can still dab concentrates onto it easily.) Or a specialized concentrate pipe/water pipe works the best IMO. Just use a torch and heat a quartz or titanium nail piece til it&#039;s red hot and dab your oil/whatever onto the nail to vaporize it. Those of us lucky enough to be around medical marijuana/dispensaries can find pieces like this in stores easy enough, otherwise look online.<br /><br />I try not to directly smoke oil with flame as it burns a little, vaporization is best.
