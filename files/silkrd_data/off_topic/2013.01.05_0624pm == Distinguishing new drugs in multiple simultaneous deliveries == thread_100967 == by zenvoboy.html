				Edit: I&#039;m really not sure why I didn&#039;t put this in the shipping section. Mods; feel free to move it if it matters/you can be arsed :)<br /><br />Of course, thanks to SR, noobs that once had very restricted access to drugs in real life now have a gateway to a whole new world of possible fun.<br /><br />Noobs like me.<br /><br />However, I was about to start placing orders for a bunch of new drugs that I&#039;ve never tried before, with most of them being white(ish) powders, but then realised... how the hell will I know what is what when they all arrive?<br /><br />Any thoughts on what I could do? Or will I just have to order them one at a time, and wait for each order to be delivered before I can order the next? BUT I WANT THEM ALL RIGHT NOW DAMNIT!&nbsp; :P lol<br /><br />Just wondering if anybody else here has had this situation?

				I personally would recommend ordering more slowly.<br /><br />As a noob I had a problem where I ordered Ketamine from two vendors at around the same time.&nbsp; Then they ended up being marked in transit on the same day and when I received the first one I didnt know who it was from.&nbsp; Boy did I feel stupid.<br /><br />I just finalized both orders out of embarrassment.&nbsp; Both arrived eventually.<br /><br />Anyway, certain vendors will mark things and others won&#039;t.&nbsp; You are safer off ordering more slowly or ordering things that look distinctly enough for you to tell apart.&nbsp; You can always PM them with the location it was sent from and ask them to verify but some of them might not want to do even that.<br /><br />Just my $.02

				Ask the seller to put a note in the package saying what it is.<br /><br />Or put an extra initial in your name to indicate who you bought it from.<br /><br />i.e. your name is John Smith<br /><br />so you give your name as John A Smith to dealer 1<br />John B smith to dealer 2<br />John C Smith to dealer 3<br /><br />Just make sure to keep a note of which letter means what

				Yeah I have a scale, so actually... that was really dumb of me&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />(I just usually keep the product in the original packaging/baggie from the start, as transferring from packaging to scale to packaging and back to scale again (when preparing doses etc.) means a tiny amount usually gets lost along the way... so didn&#039;t really think of that)<br /><br />^ Using a different letter in my name is a good idea, but I&#039;d prefer to use my normal/real name on all of them as to not arouse any suspicion.

When you enter your address change things like; use of middle initial (as said above), first name (Rob, Robert, Bob etc.), use of full capitals or partial, any other spelling variations (that aren&#039;t too obvious). You get the idea.<br /><br />Otherwise ask your vendor to put a mark (cross, square, circle) on something contained inside the letter.

				The above would probably be easiest - but test kits would be anther option?

				Unfortunately my name isn&#039;t like a &quot;Robert&quot; type that could be shortened. I could have &quot;Mr&quot; added on one of the packages or something like that though, and I do have a middle name, so could include that initial on another. With that I could make 4 different names for the package without looking suspicious.<br /><br />&quot;First Last&quot;, &quot;First M Last&quot;, &quot;Mr First Last&quot;, &quot;Mr First M Last&quot;.<br /><br />Test kits is another option I guess, yeah. But then again, it&#039;d be extra cost &amp; wasted product (even if only a tiny amount) for something that could really be avoided with just a little more patience ::)

				I had wondered about this topic as well when in the midst of a buying frenzy (Merry Christmas to me!). I also had the thought occur just a day or two ago - how do I keep things separate at home? I have some 2C capsules that look like (part of) pharmahuasca capsules, coke, speed and ket all in the same kind of little baggies.<br />On top of all this I am usually fucked up when I hide these things around the flat. I am not sure, but I find this (at least in regards to myself) quite funny!<br />&nbsp;;D<br />

If you ask after you make an order, it shouldn&#039;t be a problem. Just be honest with them and tell them you&#039;re expecting different packages and would like to be sure which is which.
