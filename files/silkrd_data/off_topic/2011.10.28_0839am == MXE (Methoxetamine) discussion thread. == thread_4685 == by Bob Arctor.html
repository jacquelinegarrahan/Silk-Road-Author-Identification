				I want to try MXE! Unfortunately I don&#039;t have access to any vendors that sell the &#039;good&#039; stuff. I&#039;d like to purchase it from clearnet if possible, just for overall ease. There has been some debacle lately about the US sourced MXE being crap compared to the EU ones. I know there are websites out there, but anyone want to help me (and I&#039;m sure a few others) out by posting or PMing the link to one of these &#039;good&#039; vendors?

				I also am very interested in MXE.&nbsp; Particularly for the mental healing properties RI and so many others espouse.<br />The only concern I have, are reports of tiletamine&nbsp; being passed off as MXE by some unscrupulous vendors. <br />I am eagerly awaiting my shipment and will post here when I have had the chance to test. Probably in a week or so.

				I suppose I better post here seeing as my link to it, I&#039;ll point out at the beginning I do sell it here on SR so take all of what I say as if I&#039;m salesman etc but I do have a long (well relative to how long it&#039;s been around) history with it so I can answer questions or help about things. <br /><br />I honestly wouldn&#039;t recommend MXE as a long term anti depressant as it&#039;s euphoric effects fade after a while (talking a few months here) but if not used habitually it might be worthwhile for this and recreationally it&#039;s great.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a bit of a advert I sell it internationally at competitive prices and my UK prices are lower than the RC places. My SR page is http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/58073

				MXE is just an all round great drug.<br />low doses are great, got a nice buzz, the euphoria isnt as good as DXM but its still alright.<br />when you get above 20/30mg it gets pretty trippy. <br />mixed with nitrous its nuts, it really potentates it, like its what i imagined pcp would be like, last night i did only 5 bulbs and felt like i was falling/morphing into my bed, also you get this &quot;behind the scenes&quot; feel where you can almost see the effects happening, but its something you mostly forget once its over, one thing that happened last night which has never happened before was i saw two pictures spinning, one was the witch from the snow white movie, and the other was obama, then they merged together and i had this epiphany that obama was like the witch, offering change like the witch offered snow white the poison apple. <br />the first nitrous bulb you always get this crazy vivid dream but every time its over you forget it, also after the nitrous i always start nodding which is cool.<br />when smoked it gives you such a good rush, even just a hit of weed you get the same rush just a bit weaker, seems to bring the opiate effects out more.<br />as for anti depressant effects, it only seems to work on me the first few hours, ive had a terrible life, and its like i almost want to cry from the happiness i feel at the start, although there was one time where all i was focusing on was the shit stuff, and had these flashbacks of like when my friends dogged me and got people to roll me, or when my mother got shot and i saw her in a pool of blood, it was like i was there again, which wasnt very nice, but then there have been good times where i completely forget about my life, like the effects of the drug are the start of life and everything before it didnt happen.<br />the only problem i see is that its hard not to do it, the past 10 days ive done it around 6 times..<br /><br />

				I personally like to do MXE sporadically on a friday evening after work.<br /><br />First a small line of 10-15 mg, and redose after an hour or so with 15 mg and maybe once more after an hour with 15-20 mg.<br /><br />Music is so beautifully enhanced with it. It makes my thoughtproces explode with creativity and happiness. I like to keep it this way so I use it the least as possible (once or twice a month). I don&#039;t feel the urge to M-hole with this stuff. I think it just fucks up your tolerance.<br /><br />

				Well, I guess I can write a review for clearnet vendor I bought MXE from.<br /><br />It&#039;s http://buy-jwh.com.<br />They sell many different RC&#039;s. They will only sell it to you, if the stuff you&#039;re buying is legal (or rather isn&#039;t illegal) in your country. I haven&#039;t ordered anything else from them, because, well, I&#039;m not really interested in anything else they have. <br />MXE price starts at $20.60/g. and gets lower if you buy more than 1 gram. Plus $6.80 for the shipping with registered letter.<br />Paying them for me was almost as much trouble as getting Bitcoins. They accept MoneyGram, AlertPay, bank transfers, WesternUnion, Unistream, maybe something else I don&#039;t remember. Being cheap and not wanting to pay high WU fees I choose money transfer service I hadn&#039;t even heard before. It too 4 trips to the bank and few hours to complete that payment! And one would think bank clerks were familiar with the services they offer... Anyway, buy-jwh.com support was always there to help me (even though useless in my case, but at least I had someone to talk to;)). Confirming the payment took 3 days! After my order was shipped it arrived withing 5 business days EU-&gt;EU. Product is declared as chinese perfume sample and is vacuum sealed. Very good packaging. I ended up paying them couple of bucks extra, so they threw me in a sample of &#039;PV&#039; which I guess stands for MDPV. I thought that was a nice gesture. I did a small sample sublingually and even though I don&#039;t have anything to compare to, I think this is good quality MXE. Overall - I&#039;m satisfied with buy-jwh.com .

Personally myself I&#039;d only do a high dose if I wanted to spend the best part of day on it and be unable to do anything else. <br /><br />Highest I did was 135mg by IM which at the time was not very clever but that&#039;s what tolerance does to you (won&#039;t advise anyone does this level of dose by this means of administration). Now I cut back down to smaller amounts and less time consuming methods of use.

				Sometime last week I did a small sample (~10mg if I can trust my Chinese scale) sublingually. Taste is similar to medicine pills, not too bad. I held it under the tongue for 5-10 mins and then swallowed with a small amount of water. Within 10 minutes I started feeling drunk. Decided to lay down and started laughing. Perception of space was a bit distorted, but nothing special. I was feeling chatty and in a good mood. Sitting in one place felt wrong, so I ended up cleaning the whole flat. Then I went for a walk. The whole time legs felt &#039;rubbery&#039; and I kept bumping into the walls, which was very funny. Being outside felt great. When I came back I checked the time - 4 hours have passed and I still felt high (and tired by that time). Wrote a couple of emails.&nbsp; ~5 hours later went to sleep. Next morning felt a bit groggy, because I went to sleep later than usually. No noticeable difference in mood later in the day.<br /><br />It was a very enjoyable experience that I would compare with sativa high + something extra. <br /><br />I plan to take ~30mg next time to explore dissociative effects of MXE, and I&#039;ll probably take couple friends along:)

				I tried some MXE last weekend, I was somewhat inspired by RI&#039;s thread and well, I don&#039;t know if this is just not the chemical for me or what but I have never felt violated by any chemical in my life!&nbsp; I mean I was FUCKED in a bad sort of way, felt like I was insane for about 3 hours, confusion and vomiting.&nbsp; Certain aspects of it felt good, but I had too many negative effects.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got a sample from a reputable vendor, and others have said this vendor&#039;s MXE was fine, so I don&#039;t know if maybe i&#039;m allergic to it or what, but it was NOT fun at all.&nbsp; I did read one other review that said they experienced some negative effects from this vendor&#039;s MXE.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m curious though to see if a sample from another vendor might be different, almost scared to try though.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s most likely that MXE is just not for me.&nbsp; I do have about 60 mg left though of the sample and if any experienced person wants the rest of my sample, I&#039;d be happy to give it away.

				I wanted a pretty kick ass dose to start off with so I went with 35mg IM.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was so just thrown off balance (figuratively speaking) after the first dose, that I really couldn&#039;t figure out if I liked it or not?!&nbsp; Its almost as if after the peak, I couldn&#039;t remember how felt. I really have a hard time describing how it made me feel....so 2 hours later, 20mg insufflated, and then 15mg an hour after that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did have some great CEV&#039;s<br /><br />The body thing felt kinda cool, except for my stomach, and well mentally I just don&#039;t know what to say.&nbsp; I would come short of calling it euphoria, but maybe that&#039;s just because the nausea killed it for me.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t want to name the vendor in the thread because I didn&#039;t want to seem like I was slamming the vendor, some people on other forums are really quick to accuse you of being another vendor, etc, being a &quot;shill&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus, I didn&#039;t feel like my physical safety was compromised in such a way that might endanger someone else, and I didn&#039;t want to give the vendor any negative press as everything else with the vendor I have been extremely happy with.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll PM if you wish Bob...just tell me where you prefer.

Nausea seems common on larger doses with no tolerance. My belly feels weird even on the small doses I&#039;ve done so far.<br /><br /><br /><br />I did some MXE yesterday, and it sucked pretty bad:/ It might be because I was crashing from all the uppers I had past week, I was more depressed than usually. So I did 20mg sublingual and snorted another 20mg 40 minutes later, because I didn&#039;t feel any positive effects. I tried listening to music, watching some stuff and chatting online, but nothing felt right. So I decided to try and get some sleep. At some point I started feeling really lonely and worthless. That dissociative haze made everything worse. I often have this fear that I&#039;m becoming schizophrenic and it felt very real on MXE. I spent ~4 hours feeling like shit and trying to get some sleep. At some point I called someone I feel closest to and we had some weird conversation. She&#039;s depressed and slightly crazy too, popping prescription shit all the time, not the best person to talk to if you&#039;re looking for affirmation. I remember waking up a few times during the night. <br />On the bright side, I&#039;m feeling much better today. Kind of optimistic. Maybe MXE did something good in the end. Though I feel that I should make a break from all the drugs.

				Hi, just to bump this to say I&#039;ve changed my pricing due to better supplier relations, I can now offer 1g of MXE for $25.97/£16.45 to international customers, this includes the stealthed shipping as standard. In addition to this my domestic orders are now $23.04/£14.59 a gram, I&#039;m quite sure this means I&#039;m the cheapest UK source currently and almost matching what some RC sellers ask for 500mg also cheaper than Buy-JWH if you include the shipping costs. If the OP could edit his post to add this that&#039;d be great.

				So last Friday I decided to give MXE a proper dose test. I also invited buddy to join me on this. Started of with 30mg snorted + hit of strong sativa weed. Laid back and watched stuff like Oddsac, psychedelic music videos etc. Lots of mind-blowing visions and realizations happened during the night:) Did couple more bumps, I think 20mg + 10mg and plenty of weed. It pretty much was 8 hours of awesomeness:)<br /><br />Couple of &#039;great ideas&#039; I remember from that night:<br />&quot;Why would anyone do any other drug when there is MXE???&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m riding chillwaves.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You know, if Morpheus came and offered me to choose between Blue Pill and Red Pill I would crush them and snort them both...&quot;<br />&quot;Well, that&#039;s pretty much what it&#039;s like to live in 21st century - we don&#039;t look for the Truth anymore, we just snort everything we can get our hands on.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We have to let people know.&quot;<br /><br />It all feels very dream-like now, but it was (one of?) the best drug experiences in my life. For the lest of the weekend I was just smoking weed and chilling. MXE seems to &#039;potentiate&#039; other substances. I take a hit of weed and I&#039;m floating:) I had no hangover, no bad thoughts. MXE is really something! <br />

				I picked up some MXE from Reich, and I gotta say I love it.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I have quite a bit of experience with MXE so I thought I&#039;d share some of my thoughts.<br /><br />First off, MXE is a very heavy drug, meaning I can&#039;t imagine anyone being hard headed with this stuff. If you take it, you&#039;re going to trip. Balls deep trip. It is not for the faint of heart, however it is a very forgiving drug. It treats you with mother&#039;s touch and caresses you as you trip. At least that&#039;s my experience.<br /><br />It can have very intense CEV&#039;s but different from any other psychedelics I ever tried.<br /><br />At medium to high levels, say 35mg or so, I get these kind of landscape type of visuals. It appears as if I&#039;m looking through someone else&#039;s eyes as I&#039;m hovering over forests that change into snowscapes, deserts morphing into beaches. You zoom over these landscapes kind of the way Google Earth swoops around the virtual globe. It has a very confusing, disorientating, Being John Malkovich vibe to it all. But beautiful as well.<br /><br />At even higher doses - 50mg or more, the colors shift from green, white and blue and into reds and blacks. It can appear very hellish, kind of how I&#039;d imagine Apokolips from DC comics would look like. But the textures can be veil like as if you&#039;re looking at light peering through thin red cloth. It has a very ancient Asian kind of feel to them.<br /><br />The visuals tend to very blocky in nature. Like something Jack Kirby would draw.<br /><br />It can provide very high levels of focus and introspection and much like MDMA, it can unearth truths about yourself which can be helpful or crushing, all depending on what you&#039;re searching for or if you&#039;re searching at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s can warp you and send you spiraling around like ketamine but in a more controlled manner. But instead of spiraling, it&#039;s more like you&#039;re on rails, like a first person shooter navigating through a labyrinth.<br /><br />And it has a whirlybird type feel to it, as if you&#039;re flying in a helicopter - whoop, whoop, whoop. If you like nitrous oxide and wonder what a powerfully high and long lasting dose would feel like, MXE just might be up your alley.<br /><br />It&#039;s also very long lasting with effects lingering well after 6-8 hours. The come down is very gradual but it&#039;s easy to top up with subsequent doses. I usually start with 35-50mg and build up through there but I&#039;m pretty experience with this drug. I wouldn&#039;t go pass 25mg starting off on your first couple of trips. More like 15-20mg for a first timere. From there, I&#039;ll gradually increase my dosage until I&#039;m in the red zone. I have not experienced much tolerance with this stuff. You can take it for several days in a row and still have a powerful trip. I do it all the time. No trouble falling asleep after tripping. No weird heart problems or increased blood pressure. MXE is not a stim at all. The opposite is fact - couch lock.<br /><br />The one thing I don&#039;t care for, it has a very alcohol-like, intoxicating, wobbling effect to it. Like going on a week long bender. As I don&#039;t care for alcohol, this has negative effects on me. If you plan on taking MXE, make sure you&#039;re prepared and have everything at your disposal. I can barely walk to my bathroom. I have a pee jar next to my bed. Seriously! And don&#039;t even consider driving. Make sure to do your grocery shopping before hand. But like I said above, it provides a very tight mental focus even as your body dissolves into jello around your brain.<br /><br />I personally obtain it through the gray market. http://www.everestsmoke.com/ is my go to person. Goes by Cantliveforever on the http://www.euphoricknowledge.com/ forums and is very well thought of, both personally and on the forums. My orders usually arrive 2 days after ordering. She&#039;s located halfway across the US from where I live.<br /><br />My second source is http://motionresearchco.com/. Very good guy, always treats me well. Can&#039;t go wrong with either vendor. Both stock other gray market drugs and both take credit cards.<br /><br />This drug is not for everyone. It&#039;s personally one of my favorite &quot;legal&quot; psychedelics but I can very well understand someone not liking it.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably missing something but I&#039;ve rattled on long enough. If I remember more, I&#039;ll post it or if you have any questions, feel free to ask.<br /><br />Crisis

It separates it&#039;s effects from other drugs, meaning, if I smoke some pot after the affects of MXE have taken hold, I can tell what properties the pot provides while still containing the effects of the MXE. It doesn&#039;t really stack like other drugs - no candyflipping with this drug, at least for me. But I find this very interesting and helpful.

				Honestly, I only tried K three times before deciding it wasn&#039;t for me. The last time I took it, and it&#039;s been years, I think I K-holed but I don&#039;t know if I have enough experience to tell. I remember it felt like I was spiraling through outer space until finally landing and having my first and only alien encounter.<br /><br />At medium to high doses, MXE is more like zipping around a maze. But you&#039;re not really in the maze, more like floating right above it. Other times, at higher doses, it can feel like you&#039;re in the maze, traversing through canyon walls or through a city full of skyscrapers. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to compare since the effects last for such different amounts of time and maybe I was a bit hasty in my comparisons. But they both seem like very out-of-body experiences and both have profound anesthetic properties.

				Can&#039;t wait to try MXE.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a few lines of K, perhaps around 100mg.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I laid back in the couch, comfy and started watching a concert by Hugh Laurie in New Orleans (amazing stuff).<br /><br />The effects kicked in after a few minutes when the band was playing some awesome blues.<br /><br />Wow what a trip.<br /><br />After that I entered the K-hole.<br /><br />It&#039;s amazing, I have this feeling that I can&#039;t get out of it, but I&#039;m in control of my thoughts, which abound. <br />It freaks me out in a fantastic way.&nbsp; &nbsp; Lots of fractals when I close my eyes.<br /><br />I find it interesting that K somehow &quot;breaks&quot; the music, makes it slower and fragmented.&nbsp; It&#039;s weird.<br /><br />

				Hi guys I&#039;m not sure if anyone else has noticed this yet but I though I better write a post about the change in batch quality that&#039;s recently happened a few weeks ago. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only just noticed it as I moved into a new batch, it&#039;s now more grainy feels sharper to the nose (not overly painful just more so than before) and the effect of this type seems to be quite different. It produces a slow disassociate effect that seems to last longer but is must less of a visual trip to me, I&#039;d guess around 6-8 hours or so it&#039;s hard to say as I&#039;ve not had much feedback on this new batch yet. I&#039;ve been speaking with my various dealers and they&#039;ve acknowledged this change. <br /><br />The good news however is that through trial and error of old street methods of purifying and crystallizing other chemicals I&#039;ve found it can be quite easily &#039;activated&#039; to give the same effects as the previous MXE I was selling. To do this you just need to dissolve it into clean water and then evaporate the water. The easiest/fastest method of doing this I find is a foil container &amp; lighter or a frying pan if you&#039;re processing more than a half gram. Once done you&#039;ll be left with a white powder, it doesn&#039;t have a consistency as fine as the older batches but it has the same effects and seems to be a tad stronger too. Please note if you do use a frying pan, don&#039;t (I need to check this I&#039;ve not practiced this method for a while) use a non stick pan else you end up scrapping off the pan&#039;s covering with the powder and get black parts in it. <br /><br />Currently I&#039;m selling it in the raw form I&#039;m getting it in, this is because I think some people prefer the slower and longer disassociation effect it gives, this is also why I&#039;m writing this so that people can try both types themselves.&nbsp; However in a few weeks time I will probably &#039;cook&#039; some of it and offer it as another sale option. However I can not guarantee that it won&#039;t go stale if I do this (some other chemicals when cooked like this are strong when used straight afterwards but tend to lose some strength over a few weeks time, which is not normally a problem but could be for orders which take 10days~ to arrive) I will cook some up and leave it for 18 days or so to see if this does happen and get back about it. Also note the effects of it raw and cooked may vary from what I&#039;ve seen and experienced as I&#039;ve been quite a heavy diss user for a very long while so they don&#039;t tend to affect me the same any more, who knows it could just be me who has this perceived difference in quality. <br /><br />If anyone has any questions or comments relating to this please comment, I&#039;d love to hear what other people think of this change/if they&#039;ve noticed it too.

				Hey Reich, I&#039;ve been reading on Euphoric Knowledge about the new batches of MXE being much weaker than normal. People have to take upwards of 200mg to feel the effects of 50mg of the previous batch. Is your batch the same? I&#039;ve also seen talk of the differences between &quot;Domestic&quot;(U.S) and UK MXE, the domestic feeling more narcotic and sedating. It could be you got a different isomer. <br /><br />Oh also, can you do 3-MeO-PCP in bulk? I know you took it off your menu, but there are so few places selling it and I&#039;d love to pick up a gram.

We just have one question for you... <br /><br />How long does the K-Hole experience last for on MXE?<br /><br />We ask that because we are only familiar with the K-Hole length of trip.<br /><br />Thanks :) We are looking forward to sampling this dissociative and plan to film our &quot;bodies&quot; while we trip.\<br /><br />EnterTheMatrix

				I got streetpharmacy&#039;s MXE yesterday. Took one week to arrive to the US. I don&#039;t know too terribly much about MXE, but his is white and sort of a flour-ey consistency. Having never taken dissociatives before I&#039;ve just been testing in the low dose ranges from 15-25mg sublingually. Can&#039;t really compare his to much else, but I do say I&#039;ve been enjoying it very thoroughly so far! It&#039;s not hard to function in public on low doses either, but I wouldn&#039;t try to drive on it.

				Greetings fellow silkers.<br /><br />Yesterday night I snorted what I believe was around 70mg of Streetpharmacy&#039;s MXE, in four lines over a period of 30 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as I hit the first line I had this very strong impression that I was snorting cocaine, because there was a substance in MXE that reminded me of coke, I don&#039;t know which one (could it be ether?), it was weird, but it was definitely there.<br /><br />Anyway, the effects began to slowly build up just like ketamine, the same sedating effects.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure I hit a K hole, or M hole.&nbsp; &nbsp;But the effects were interesting, I had these emotions, I was in love.&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, in love.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I won&#039;t expand into this subject because what happened last night isn&#039;t clear yet, but I did feel very good.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am going to have to try this again.<br /><br />It was very hard for me to go to sleep, lots of fractals and this feeling like I was sedated.&nbsp; &nbsp; The landscape and crazy visual descriptions made by Crisis (previous page) are exactly what I experienced.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MXE is very like Ketamine (sedation and heavy body load), except there&#039;s no K hole, but I think there is an M hole to be found somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will have to resume this search another day.<br /><br />I was reading the MXE vault at Erowid and I see that the effect can last up to 48 hours?&nbsp; &nbsp;This caught my attention. <br />Have you guys tripped so long?<br /><br />MXE is very interesting.<br /><br /><br />Thank you Silk Road!&nbsp; &nbsp; You have introduced me to K and MXE, both of which are doing me very good on a personal level, they are expanding my little stubborn and diehard mind and helping me understand my troubled self better.

				Setting: Friday night, friends place.<br />Mood: feeling down like always, been a stressful week.<br />Other drugs: some weed, hash, ciggies, beer during the week, nothing heavy, and 10mg. of MXE for the last 3 days. Friend had a little amphetamine binge during the week. Nothing else taken on a said night/day, few ciggies.<br />Dosage: 50mg snorted, 30mg bump few hours later.<br />Experience: we both snort 50mg. in one go, make some tea, discuss Terence McKenna&#039;s views on ego and human evolution. In ~15mins. MXE starts to kick in, it gets harder to converse. We both just get stuck in the middle of the sentence, forget what exactly we wanted to say. Like always experience starts with drunk, speedy feeling. I noticed this before, but now we both agree that this came-up feeling is somewhat dangerous and negative; you feel invincible and retarded. I imagine PCP feels that way multiplied many times. Thankfully, this passes fast (like 15 mins?). After that MXE shows its warm, lulling, euphoric side (something like opiates?) that slowly into full trip. The closest description of MXE trip I can think of is that you go behind the scenes of consciousness. We watch The Magic Trip, documentary made of the footage filmed during the famous bus ride with Kesey and Marry Pranksters. Watching stuff is very involving, but that docu is disappointingly average. Time goes by fast. At this point I take 30mg. bump and soon start feeling overwhelmed. Sitting feels too hard so I lie down and listen to music. My memories are a blurry. Later my friend told me that I was asking where this girl I know is, because I was convinced she was with us. I feel that I met her in my trip. That is a bit strange, because she&#039;s nothing significant to me, just someone I know and I haven&#039;t met her for couple of months. MXE trip always goes in waves for me. So I was lying in the dark (got sensitive to brightness) with my eyes closed, going in and out of consciousness. Then a completely clear &#039;voice&#039; or a thought in my head told me why I was feeling depressed all the time, some of the things I couldn&#039;t figure out myself, and told me that Everything Will Be OK, that I will find my happiness, and I mustn&#039;t give up. That felt, I don&#039;t know, magical? Spiritual? I always considered myself a man of science, and this isn&#039;t something I was expecting or looking for. I got up to wash my face and threw up a bit. Not a &#039;empty your stomach because you&#039;re poisoned&#039; way, but like there was some unneeded bit in me. I felt like I died that night and was reborn fresh that night. <br />It was early morning already, I was feeling very tired and wobbly. I enjoy sleeping in my own bed, so I took a bus and went home.<br />Aftermath: I woke up Saturday afternoon, feeling slightly hung-over. Took a shower and ate small breakfast. After that I started feeling fresh and energetic. Not speedy like on stimulants, but simply in good spirits. Went to a bar and had a great night. Now it&#039;s 4 days after the trip and I&#039;m feeling simply OK. I still get annoyed by my job, but I feel clear-headed and energetic. I simply enjoy living. :)<br />Conclusion: It wasn&#039;t what I would describe a pleasant trip. More like a cleansing. First time I took similar amount of MXE I also smoked a lot of cannabis. That trip was very pleasant and interesting, but lacked the healing properties. I feel like taking a break from MXE for now. I simply feel no need for it. I hope this positiveness I&#039;m feeling now will last :) <br /><br />Bob

				Lol, this stuff is powerful.. Had 2 friends try some today.

The one who did the lower dosage has done 50mg easy, plus redoses and did not have this reaction. So maybe last time wasn&#039;t as pure? Or he is very sensitive to it today? LOL.

				MXE may very well become your new Drug of Choice Awesome1126, it is a great feeling. <br /><br />A couple tips:<br />-Parachute 30mg, snort around 20mg (if its low purity, last batch of mine must have been very very pure) and see how you feel..<br />-NO DRIVING. <br />-If you have to do anything in public either keep your dosage low, or not at all. This stuff messes up your cognitive functions. <br />-Walking, can be hard. You will feel drunk, high, and forming words at high doses can be a challenge. <br /><br />Its a fun chem, but take it slow 10 mins at a time and see how your are.

				Hey guys thought I&#039;d just update you with some of the methods I&#039;ve tried of dissolving it to make it come on quicker &amp; be like the old batch. I tried two methods, slow dissolving and evaporation and fast. In both I used 100mg of MXE with a 2% margin of error, dissolved in 5ml of water each(quite excessive for this amount of MXE but this was just a test) . <br /><br />The fast batch was heated in an aluminum container to dissolve quicker then boiled to evaporate the water off, I didn&#039;t time either method but this took roughly an hour. My end product weighed at 70mg, I imagine this is for 2 reasons:<br /><br />1. Boiling it fast make it spit meaning some MXE is probably lost<br />2. Scraping the powder off doesn&#039;t always give 100% return due to folds in the material or small residue etc. <br /><br />The slow batch was left in 5ml of the water, not heated for 2 days in which time it dissolved and then evaporated, the container was steel and near the end I heated it lightly with a lamp to get rid of any moisture to prevent it from making it weigh too much. My end amount was 91mg however I can also still see some left over in the container so it could be a few mg higher. <br /><br />Overall the latter method seems to be preferred, I can&#039;t compare the quality of the end products as due to the differences in time taken the first one has been sitting for a few days and because side by side tests would probably tend to the later dose being preferred due to already being high off the first one. <br /><br />As for the other things people have asked me to test I will get back to you on them once I have my relevant equipment. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4685.msg62513#msg62513">Quote from: Notshadow on December 15, 2011, 04:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />A couple tips:<br />-Parachute 30mg, snort around 20mg (if its low purity, last batch of mine must have been very very pure) and see how you feel..<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure if that was directed at me but if it was you&#039;ve got to keep in mind that I have had incredibly high tolerance at the time due to injecting use and that I usually seek a more incapacitating dose for the heavy hallucinations. <br /><br />Also on an unrelated note I also offer 10g to purchase now on SR for $169 or £109

Of all the arylcyclohexamines, ketamine is unique in the most significant ways. So far there is nothing else like it. MXE should be seen as a shorter acting PCP analogue.

However on the lower doses they tend to get more differentiated and now as I dose small but more often I find they&#039;re not really the same, I find MXE more psychedelic but less sedating or drunk than ket used to be.

On a personal basis as someone who had bladder damage from ketamine I can say it feels less damaging but it&#039;s still certainly there but weaker than the pain I get from using ketamine or the other PCP analogs. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It should build slowly, just like with ketamine.

If it is already too high because of ketamine, you might not get much out of MXE.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I didn&#039;t find the cross tolerance was that high when I first tried it, I&#039;d been a heavy ketamine user prior to trying it but I found even 30mg was fine for a long while for me I did however notice I seemed better at keeping myself normal during use and not being overwhelmed unlike other people who I knew, however this may have been due to my generally good use with not doing massive lines. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is interesting is that while I found it fun, weird, and interesting, I never found it to be very euphoric. Since switching to 20mg once a week, it has started to become euphoric. I wonder if I wasn&#039;t capable of experiencing the euphoria until MXE&#039;s antidepressant effects had first changed my brain enough. I don&#039;t know why it is, but the last time I took it (last weekend) was the most euphoric it has ever been. More euphoric than any drug I have ever taken. I was just playing a video game, thinking about my life, but I was perfectly content in a way that I can&#039;t describe. I had none of the confusion of the higher doses, but such an unusual amount of warmth. When it ended I considered taking another 20mg, and then decided that I would wait until next week.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I must admit this is interesting to know, for me I only found the anti depressive effects were noticeable for the 20~ hours after use but were great. I might try tailing off and trying you lower weekly dosage idea to see if it produces a similar effect. <br /><br />I tried acetone washing some samples a few days ago,&nbsp; two 100mg trials from two different UK suppliers. Neither dissolved however both mixtures did go cloudy suggesting some minor impurity I&#039;ll be testing some other suppliers stuff too and then put a full thing up about it.

				I was under the impression that bladder problems arose from Ketamine metabolizing into Norketamine which is highly alkaline and more corrosive. This is shown somewhat when Ketamine is taken rectally it causes bladder problems much faster. Norketamine seems to be the reason for K-pain stomach cramps too.

				A lot of the bladder damage also arises from dehydration and a lack of proper diet. I think research showed that caffeine was far worse for the bladder, however the lifestyle of tea drinkers was far removed from that of Ketamine addicts. (don&#039;t quote me on this btw)<br /><br />A friend used to take 10-20 grams of Ketamine each day on top of amphetamines, benzos, and occasionally opiates and RC&#039;s. He eventually got very very bad K cramps (intense stomach pain), but a hospital check revealed no bladder damage at all. He cured the stomach cramps with loads of food, I assume the food soaked up the norketamine or got the stomach working to digest it.<br /><br />I think some preservatives that are used in liquid vials also caused adverse effects.

My diet is fine I&#039;m healthy apart from drug use. As for the exact damage, I don&#039;t know as I&#039;m not a doctor nor did I ever go to one, I know if I did the simple answer would have been &quot;stop using it then&quot;.

You might be able to hole on MXE or PCP, but you will be walking around in traffic naked. Ketamine shuts your body down when you are holed, and that is what makes it safe.

This one isn&#039;t meant for holing.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know what you mean but I&#039;d say a hole is subjective to what people think they are. I find MXE can be holed on but as you said should not be done in public.

My opinion on the whole matter may be biased as I knew plenty of Ketamine users from streets who had problems, one dealer who had a mobile catheter because of the damage it caused. As well as stories older users (from 90s etc) who now have bladder related problems. However like all things said on the street I&#039;d take this with a pinch of salt, unfortunately disinformation and ignorance are much more popular there.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

It feels kind of like a DXM comedown (which is actually pretty decent). I have done a lot of powdered DXM (bought from China) and is much easier on the body/stomach than cough syrup. So I guess I have a closer frame of reference to compare.

				Save for the last three days now, i was doing MXE every night for a week straight with dosages up to 75-80mg done in 20 mg increments.<br />Maybe I had a good batch as I insufflate and have had no problems with congestion or soreness and also no ear ringing or other symptoms that have been reported here. I did however have a bout of LBS the day after a particularly heavy night.<br />Typical symptoms I have had are increased music appreciation, lovely CEV&#039;s and frequent urination due to drinking almost gallon of water over the course of an evening.<br />I would also like to note that I absolutely love this stuff and cannot wait until next week to try a new batch.<br /><br />Happy trails everyone!<br /><br />T

				Woah is all I have to say! Didn&#039;t expect that I&#039;d like it so much!<br /><br />I received a sample from RI a while back that I forgot about. I snorted the whole bag last night and JESUS CHRIST! I used to do DXM quite a bit, but this blows DXM out of the water. I&#039;m currently in this awesome afterglow. My whole body is numb and relaxed. When I walk I feel like I don&#039;t have a body. It&#039;s pretty cool.<br /><br />Last night was intense as hell. I had gone over to a friend&#039;s house to party, and when I got back I decided to try it since I couldn&#039;t sleep and was feeling pretty down. I&#039;m not really sure how much I took, but my experiences seem to indicate somewhere around 25 mgs. I started getting little &quot;warning&quot; signs right away and less then 30 minutes later I was for sure in the hole. I remember just listening to music for a really long time (an hour or so) and then turning on my disco ball so I could lie down, think, and enjoy the show. I love how introspective I became. The extreme paranoia and fear I feel due to my PTSD was completely gone and for the first time in a long time I was in the driver&#039;s seat instead of the PTSD. I was truly grateful to my HP for all the good things in life and felt so lucky to be who I am. I was also very talkative even though talking felt very strange, so I called up a friend and we had a stellar conversation. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t experience a ton of visual hallucinations, but everything seemed really out of proportion (just like with DXM) and heavy. I was completely numb inside my body, but still had a sense that everything was fine and I could move around fairly easily. I felt like I was the image at the end of a kaleidoscope. Before I finally passed out I remember rolling around in my sheets while giggling uncontrollably. Even now I feel like a whole new person.<br /><br />I&#039;m defs adding MXE to my favs. I&#039;ve never tried special k, but I think I might now after this experience. What a relief! I didn&#039;t think I could still tap into myself so intimately.

				I just did some fantastic Ketamine and I can safely say that it is a much more enjoyable experience than MXE. It&#039;s shorter, stronger and more euphoric and provides insights that are purely and utterly amazing and comforting. It also provides answers to these experiences and doesn&#039;t leave you over thinking like MXE does to me. <br /><br />Just a personal preference... I will never do MXE again when Ketamine is available, there really is a huge difference.<br /><br />Matrix

				To Aliahad, I find that existing use also seems to factor in quite heavily.&nbsp; When I was really binging on the stuff on a daily basis I found that even 30mg doses would make me see things like walls distorting etc. However I may be a bit of a misnomer as I&#039;ve abused quite a lot of drugs in the past so can be quite easy for me to psychedelically manipulate my vision. As for the M-hole I tended to find it was more around the 100-150mg range but I was snorting it. Or 60mg if injected (probably lower too but I had a heavy tolerance at that point)

				My LSD + MXE report.<br /><br />Took a nap in the afternoon before doing this.&nbsp; &nbsp; The journey begins at 3pm sharp.&nbsp; The time sequence may not be accurate, but everything happened over a period of 5 to 6 hours.<br /><br />T+0:00&nbsp; Placed two 100mic blotters in upper gum (courtesy of darkbanana :D )<br />T+1:00&nbsp; Started to feel effects, feeling waves/frequencies in my head, lightness and a few OEVs.<br />T+1:30&nbsp; As the LSD effects began to get stronger, I placed around 30mg of MXE sublingually.<br />T+2:00&nbsp; This is when I started to trip hard.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently the MXE intensified the effects of LSD.&nbsp; Strong OEV, skin morphing, lots of colors and rays.<br />T+3:30&nbsp; Another MXE bump, maybe 30mg.&nbsp; &nbsp; Wow, now I have this feeling I am morphing into imaginary characters or random people I know. It was like being inside their skin.&nbsp; &nbsp;Really weird.&nbsp; I observe my skin and thought this isn&#039;t me, I am another person.&nbsp; &nbsp;The skin texture changes, the color too, like it is tanned.&nbsp; Though ephemeral, it was a strong and intense immersion into these random fictional or real characters.&nbsp; &nbsp; Something on the line of the movie Avatar, but being inside human beings not those blue creatures.&nbsp; &nbsp;Really weird, fascinating at the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp; Lots of OEVs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />T+4:00&nbsp; Around this time I had a random thought/feeling about a close family relative and the LSD/MXE combo dragged my whole mind into it.&nbsp; &nbsp; It wasn&#039;t anything really negative, just an insignificant incident/interaction that happened last week.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it became really strong and had me scratching my head.&nbsp; &nbsp;Other underlying family and personal issues ended up surfacing.&nbsp; Deep introspection, many thoughts.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the beginning it was a bit harsh because of the intensity, but I eventually rode it out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This wasn&#039;t my first deep introspective experience, as I&#039;ve been through similar ones before when playing with LSD and 25i on separate occasions in the past.&nbsp; But MXE added an interesting twist to it/<br /><br />Also during this phase for a moment I believed I was in contact or touch with an entity.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a god, not a ghost or an ET.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was something out there, perhaps my own conscience.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />T+4:30&nbsp; I somehow instantly snapped out of this introspective state, like changing the channel of a TV.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it was the MXE.&nbsp; &nbsp;Had another tiny bump of MXE sublingually, but this time didn&#039;t swallow it after swishing for a few minutes, I simply spit it out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More dissociative effects, but with less LSD influence.<br /><br />T+5:30&nbsp; Decided I&#039;ve had enough.&nbsp; &nbsp; Went upstairs to watch a movie until I finally went to bed around 12am.&nbsp; &nbsp; Couldn&#039;t fall asleep right away, it took me a few hours. <br /><br />Conclusion:&nbsp; The dissociatve effects of MXE are fantastic.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder what the effects of LSD would have been without the MXE.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got the feeling that darkbanana&#039;s LSD blotters are very strong and good.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am planning on repeating the LSD + MXE combo in the future.<br /><br />Another thing that happens during MXE is that I have these strong and occasional feelings that 2012 is real and will happen.&nbsp; Some mystical insight.&nbsp; I know, I&#039;ve been watching too many movies and those videos called &quot;strange sounds around the world&quot; have been feeding my mind with BS.&nbsp; &nbsp; But under the influence of MXE and/or LSD I am easily impressed and amazed like a child watching a Star Wars movie.&nbsp; :D

				I did MXE and 2c-b last weekend. 20 mg of each. I didn&#039;t think they meshed together very well. It just felt like 2 different things happening in my body at the same time yet totally separate from each other. One positive was that the MXE eased the initial body load I get from 2c-b.

				From what i understand the effects of dissociatives, like all other drugs vary from person to person.&nbsp; Yes a lot of other drugs have the same overall profile, but individual effects do vary.<br />With dissociatives it seems to be&nbsp; either a love/hate thing.<br />I know the first time i tried K I hated it and swore I would never do it again.&nbsp; However, since being on the road I have been introduced to MXE and I absolutely love it.&nbsp; I have also recently acquired some K and enjoy that as well.&nbsp; I particularly like with K the shorter duration.&nbsp; I have also found the anti-depressant effects in both of them to be very effective for me which could be why I find them so enjoyable.<br />I don&#039;t know what to say, either my body chemistry changed enough to allow me to enjoy the dissociatives or I trained my mind to get the most out of them.<br />Who knows, five or six years from now you&#039;ll try it again and like it.

You might be able to hole on MXE or PCP, but you will be walking around in traffic naked. Ketamine shuts your body down when you are holed, and that is what makes it safe. I worry about people trying to hole on MXE. It is bad news. Enjoy the lower doses. This one isn&#039;t meant for holing.<br /><br /><br /><br />About the antidepressant effects, I don&#039;t know what works yet for me yet, and even then it might not work the best for others. I&#039;m still at the beginning of exploring this aspect of it. I plan on doing 2 20mg doses back to back this weekend to see if it works better. I&#039;m still not sure how much I should do in one dose, in one session, or how often the sessions should be. I&#039;m pretty sure they should be every week or every other week, but the lowest dose needed to get the right effects isn&#039;t clear yet. I do notice the antidepressant effect is strong the next day, but it can often come and go for a couple weeks as it slowly lessens. I was depressed, and in denial about it until I found relief with MXE, and that hasn&#039;t come back yet. So even without knowing the best routine yet, it is still working great for me.<br /><br />You should probably edit your last post reich, the quoting is a little screwed up.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First, holing on MXE is, like you said, possible, but I would definitely disagree with you on your saying &quot;it is not a proper hole&quot;.&nbsp; I have &#039;M-hole&#039;d&#039; twice, now, and I have been perfectly content on my couch with eyes closed or in some weird opened state watching movies. I also was out in my back lawn listening to boards of canada and wolves in the throne room entering a hole, or feeling it pull me in, perfectly content. I had warm clothes on and remained in a chair for a good 30 minutes contently.<br /><br />The thing is, I understand your concern with people walking around whilst in the hole, or in a state very close to it. I have kept myself safe by limiting my use to at the household. Yes, I walk around my house like a mental patient in the depths of it, sometimes, but I find it quite enjoyable and not a danger at all.<br /><br />Like anything, set and setting. If you are going to hole on this stuff, be in a safe environment where you&#039;re not going to walk out into oncoming traffic. I implore everyone to play it safe with this stuff because I have found its antidepressant qualities quite beneficial, and I don&#039;t want more idiots going to the hospital or getting hurt on it.<br /><br />Everyone seems pretty safe and legit on SR from my small time here, so this does not worry me.<br /><br />Again, I cannot stress how awesome the AD effects of MXE are. Just be careful with it. This is my first time two days in a row, and I do not plan on doing it more than once, maybe twice, weekly. Maybe holing once or twice a month. It is still new to me, so I am abusing my little 1g bag a wee bit. I will report back if there any problems.<br /><br />Also, last night watching 2001, I entered a hole when he is breathing in space, and that is all you hear. I remember my breathing syncing up perfectly with his - it was magic. I had a lot of ego softening and have had near ego death with this stuff. It is a definite psychedelic :D<br /><br />Lastly, does anyone notice after heavy doses of this stuff that the next day the colors seem a bit &#039;trippy&#039; still? I notice I am oversensitive to light, too. Is this common? (Ganja definitely intensifies the colors the next day)<br /><br />edit: *it must be noted that I always smoke weed during my mxe experiences*, and it definitely potentiates (sp?) the weed, and the weed definitely potentiates the mxe xD. Saves me weed, and mxe :D. Everyone agrees weed and MXE rock together, right? That is probably why MXE is so psychedelic to me :P Weed is my one daily habit that rarely is interrupted. Man I am feeling so good right now!!!! :D<br />

				What funway is saying is right to me, a M-hole is akin to a K-hole. In that you don&#039;t get one every time you use it only at high doses. To me the symptoms are either the inability to move or think properly and function normally. Usually some weird disassociation thoughts too like the world being a giant play or reality just being the room I&#039;m in. <br /><br />Anyway I actually came here to let you guys know that my MXE is back to the powder type so doesn&#039;t need to be &#039;washed&#039; before use, (it didn&#039;t really need to before it was just an open suggestion).&nbsp; That and if my prices look a bit odd at the moment it&#039;s because I&#039;m on holiday at the moment until Monday, you can find out more in my review thread or on my SR profile page. I&#039;ll be back selling MXE and other things Monday the 13th.&nbsp;

				@funway<br />yeah man, i have no experience with ket, so i understand if my support of the hole is not as reliable as a heavy ket user. however, i believe you are correct in retarted bluelight folks thinking they are &#039;hole&#039;ing&#039; when they are just really &#039;high&#039; on a lower dose, haha. trust, me, i have gone pretty far with this shit, but have tried to remain mature and know both the safe upper limit doses and that I can always blast the fuck off with weed and not worry about damaging my bladder or having soreness in joints (this is the only real downside of heavy use, for me...we&#039;ll see...) it goes away with a few days no use, anyways.<br /><br />i characterize the M-Hole by being able to close my eyes and understand I could go on an astral plane, but usually not taking it there, unless I feel it right. usually some very intense dissoc&#039; feelings, almost schizo. In the hole I usually come to some sort of realization about my life, and so far, they all seem to be helping. it has really provided a &#039;life-hacking&#039; method for me.one can choose to remain active and somewhat &#039;robo-walk&#039; in this state. this is good because one can stay hydrated and have a grand time walking around like a mental patient (some part of me weirdly loves this :) maybe it is my love of one flew over the cuckoo&#039;s next :D ) I could go on, but rambling...<br /><br />i think the M-Hole may be an acquired taste because it seems, at least from my understanding and reading, to be very different but very similar to ket...kinda like shrooms and lucy. the same but completely different...<br /><br />i get your mention of being able to function in the hole, and this is worrisome. proper safety plus set and setting remedies this downside for me, but it upsets me that dumb kiddies are going to be doing psychedelic and &#039;hole&#039; doses and perhaps hurting themselves...<br /><br />c&#039;est la vie, i suppose<br /><br />@reich<br /><br />My mxe is in a failrly clean white, very fine crystal almost powder substance. I chop up any oversized crystal with a card before sniffing. Is yours similar to this? I am wondering because this stuff seems very pure and potent, so if yours is similar, I would love to try it out sometime<br /><br />Cheers!

				I posted on the 1st page about my experience with MXE, well for about a month i was just binging on it.<br />Compared to some of the addiction stories ive read i wasn&#039;t that bad doing like 100mg daily, more like 20/30/40mg, just to get the lose dose dissociative high.<br />Then i quit for a month, ive tried it two times since then and its pretty much like when i first started using it.<br />I feel more clear headed now cause of the break, the MXE was making me a bit thick headed.<br />I&#039;m going to get some more, but this time ill only do it once or twice a fortnight, you don&#039;t want to overdo a good thing.

				Thanks man for hype man! ;D haha.<br /><br />Well i do love ego loss and softening aspects of psychs and enjoy them in large doses so im guessing it should be right for me but one will never know till they test out the hype for themselfs. Good stuff man thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Was also wondering if there is any negative after effects or effects in general from it or if it does some kind of neuron/ brain damage or makes you forget stuff after using as i am very concerned with my health ?

				I was no stranger to depression growing up, I thought it had a death grip on me when I was a lot younger. I honestly feel like psychedelics saved my life by allowing me to break out of those self-defeating confines of depression and see the world through a more positive light. Even if I wouldn&#039;t have killed myself, living such a bleak life would be just as bad in my opinion. I&#039;m happy to say that I haven&#039;t been legitimately depressed in a very long time now, and I think that drugs were central to that. I absolutely love the effects that MXE and ketamine have on my disposition too. Although I have to say I prefer ketamine -- and would advocate to anyone who likes MXE to acquire some promptly -- the after-effects of these drugs are miraculous in terms of warding off depression. In the case of ketamine I have to be careful when I do it, because I am so enchanted with life the next day that I have a hard time focusing on my priorities (of course, SR orders are the exception to this ;) ). <br /><br />Having seen personally and read extensively about the addictive potential of these drugs, I was initially concerned that they would be too alluring and lead to more problems than they fixed; to date I have not found any compulsion towards their use. That&#039;s actually why I&#039;m selling nearly all of my MXE on here; after I first sampled it I knew I wanted to keep it around for truly &quot;rainy days&quot;, and just knowing that I had a shitload on hand, I would pretty much never need to worry about depression the rest of my life. Of course at the time, the deep web was unknown to me, and being used to only sporadic access to most drugs, plus fully expecting MXE to be quickly banned, I stocked up and bought a lifetime supply, or several really. I only need the tiniest little bump to get the positive effects from the stuff, and I don&#039;t find much point in doing it more than once a week. Judging by my order flow though, usage patterns obviously vary substantially!<br /><br />It saddens me that so many people live in complete ignorance of the benefits that these drugs could bring them. It&#039;s inspiring that they are becoming recognized in the mainstream (like the NPR pieces), but they should really be more rapidly adopted, especially in relieving acute episodes of depression. Big Pharma will go to lengths to discredit and restrict these medicines though; keeping people numbed out on SSRIs and benzos is pretty profitable, and the fact that someone could just snort a line of ketamine from time to time to achieve arguably much better results will be very threatening to that business model. It&#039;s a funny world we live in, it seems like just a few tweaks could turn it into something almost utopian, yet they&#039;re so far out of reach. I mean for fuck&#039;s sake, look at what people like us are required to do just to try and make our existence a few shades brighter...&nbsp;

				@ChillyP: Your post is very well-informed, and inspiring. I, too, think my life has been saved, somewhat, by psychs and dissocs (with a healthy dose of cannabis, ofc :D) I posted that NPR piece to show that this stuff is for fucking real, and that it is not as &#039;underground&#039; as some of us may have believed. npr is pretty mainstream, even if it is &#039;liberal&#039;. it&#039;s horrible that the drug companies are going to attack things like this. such a strange place we live in. depression sucks, and this stuff has given me more &#039;positive vibes&#039; than any talk therapy or ssri ever has. feels great finding the answers myself, too. definitely feels pretty &#039;authentic&#039;<br /><br />@DrugsBunny: good to hear. my discomfort is almost completely gone. its similar to yours, but less extreme. &#039;everything in moderation, except moderation itself&#039; :)<br /><br />@dipmyfry: health problems minimal. start small, and work your way up. i wouldnt be hiting holes more than 2-3 times a month. best probably no more than 2. light doses are really where i feel the &#039;therapeutic&#039; aspects coming into play. also, a high dose afterglow is wonderful. its an RC, but any brain damage i couldnt imagine being permanent or extreme if done in moderation. you will notice short term memory issues during both the experience and afterglow, but they subside rather quickly with non-use. again, its an rc, so no one really fucking knows. i cannot stress enough that you gotta find you &#039;personal&#039; amount with this stuff. me and the few friends that use it all have different methods and amounts per x we employ. feel it out :D just have a great set and setting and be responsible. since it sounds like you can handle and enjoy your pyshcs, i think youre in for an awesome time!<br /><br />good luck!<br /><br />

				Yea so a bunch of friends and I recently tried MXE for my first time. All we needed was a little bump. It lasts for about 4-5 hours. depending on how much you do. but the high was like everything we said flowed together and we could just talk about the most random shit and just laugh our asses off. Eventually we were at the point where we did not know where we were. and every noise we heard just tripped us out. That shit is like a trip. I still prefer Ketamine over MXE as the highs seem a little different. but ketamine is kind of short lived but after you come down off it you are completely fine. no hangover or anything. but with MXE its different. everything still seems to be running in slow motion when you&#039;re coming down. Its fun, but not the kind of thing I would be doing everyday. I suggest that people who are skeptical about it to try it once. only do a tiny bit. You either like it or you dont like it. <br /><br />But overall I think I enjoyed MXE. but only with a group of friends because it made it so fun. and we had what we considered &quot;the best night of our life&quot; <br /><br />Also for any of you trippers out there, purchase a laser machine called the &quot;Laser Theatre&quot; IT IS AMAZING. it projects red and green lasers all over the walls and can light up a whole room.&nbsp; if i go to a friends house to trip I will be sure to bring that thing with me everytime. it costs about $100 but WELL WORTH the money.

But sublingual refers to under your tongue. What I personally do is start the night out with a good sized sublingual dose and just do small amounts insuffulated as the night goes on. The trick is to keep it from getting wet while it&#039;s under your tongue, try not to move your tongue around too much. It&#039;ll still work, but it&#039;s best to have the powder under your tongue rather than a bunch of saliva mixed up with it. Keep it there for at least 15-20 minutes, I do 30, and wash it down with water. If you&#039;re doing it right you&#039;ll feel it before you wash it down :)

And before anyone accuses me of being biased I&#039;ve sold both before :p

				I can usually sleep fine after MXE if I&#039;m listening to some relaxing music like ambient trance or whatever.<br />Fun things include: watching movies, watching adventure time (the cartoon network kids show which is totally ridiculous and fits the MXE mindset perfectly), listening to music, and talking to people.&nbsp; I find in low doses it is a very social drug and have occasionally taken it as an alternative to alcohol.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I think is best about this drug is that it makes me feel so good but there is no addictive craving for it, just like most psychadelics.&nbsp; I love dosing and I have plenty but I haven&#039;t taken any in a couple weeks just because I haven&#039;t felt like it.&nbsp; When I tried DXM I loved it but had to keep myself from taking it too often because I knew it fucked with your brain. Also compared to alcohol or weed which are psychologically addictive and I end up craving every few days.

				Ok so i insuffulated about or close to 15-30mg in between there my buddy had no scale. Very little not much. After we did it we chilld for about 25-30mins then i started feeling pretty odd not in a pleasurable way tho but before that like 10-15mins in i felt fine. So like 40mins in i started feeling really weird not so good for some reason like a mild headache the kind you get when you have been watching to much tv or been annoyed by someone for so long with long pointless talks anyhow like after an hour n a half i started feeling more chill and alot more energetic and not its been like 4 hours and it left me feeling good dont know how it would feel in higher doses i wanna try it but it is kind of late and want to get some sleep so idk.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also 30mins in i felt kind of nasty so i ate a meal of good food to chill it.

				ok, so seeing as most people here are MXE enthusiasts, I was wondering if anyone had tried any awesome kombos with this drug? i have some more on the way and plan on these kombos:<br /><br />mxe+mdma(1 defqon)<br />mxe+lsd (2 ganeshas)<br />mxe +25i nbome (DudeRug&#039;s tabs)<br />mxe + shrooms (Galindoi&#039;s sclerotia)<br /><br />these will all get around to being taken within the next ~2-3 months, who knows, so i will update periodically. also, since k is on the way, i may end up kitty flipping instead of the mxe + mdma, but who knows. i am just interested in this chemicals potential to potentiate, alter, or change another fun chemicals course. any experiences? anyone else as excited as me to kombo this shit?<br /><br />Cheers :D

				You can get a faster heart rate on MXE, so MDMA &amp; MXE could be a bit dangerous if you are dancing a lot, though just don&#039;t do a massive dose of either and make sure you&#039;re drinking water a lot and you&#039;ll be ok.

				Have been using MXE since Feb 2nd of this year and have consumed about 2.5 grams at this point. Honestly, I&#039;ve been having a blast. Bladder problems were a concern for a while, but I&#039;ve since figured that it&#039;s all about keeping my PH levels even. That means drinking bicarbonate of soda + water when I&#039;m taking my MXE (which at this point has been about 200mg a day due to tolerance). Fortunately at the moment I&#039;ve got enough money and supply to keep up this level of usage.<br /><br />As well, despite some wonky moments (can get veryyyyy paranoid on the stuff at times) it&#039;s mostly been fantastic. The drug is a great stimulant for me and whenever I take it I become EXTREMELY productive. Before I was in one of the deepest depressions of my life, but now I am creating a much brighter future for myself every day. I realise some of you may think, &#039;brighter future doing that much MXE a day? Ha!&#039;, but really I will stop using if I feel it affecting my life negatively. Since using the drug (really merely a trigger for significant philosophical/psychological realisations and emotional transitions) my thirst for life has returned and I do not want to do anything to derail it when it&#039;s going so good right now.<br /><br />So yeah, quite easily my favourite drug ever. Absolutely love it.<br /><br />EDIT: Please view the following message written a fellow member in regard to the PH levels theory (seems there&#039;s no scientific basis to this theory)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13570.msg140092#msg140092

				Hey Culmint.&nbsp; Exactly how I feel.<br /><br />OK.&nbsp; My experiment with taking MXE orally last night.&nbsp; Um....I took about a 1/3 less than I usually snort and it is INFINITELY stronger!&nbsp; It took longer for the effects to hit though.&nbsp; I will say this.&nbsp; I had an extremely hallucinogenic trip where shit got out of control and I won&#039;t go into details but it was extremely unsettling for my wife.&nbsp; I will be much more careful when using it orally from now on.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I just orally ingested about 50mg (eyeballed) in some toilet roll. As my tolerance at the moment is so insanely high I don&#039;t feel too worried at this minute. I had done 50mg but an hour ago and it basically did nothing at all. I know lol, I need to ease off the stuff! I&#039;ve got some 2c-b arriving tomorrow (hopefully) so should be able to start to take a break. Having about 3 grams in stock doesn&#039;t help too much either lol. Oh well. Might look into getting some MDMA soon as well to throw into the mix. Not sure. We&#039;ll see!<br /><br />Sorry to hear you had difficulties with your wife. I&#039;ve had some struggles with my fiance too on this drug. Overall though has been a positive experience.

				As well, my worries should probably be assuaged by the fact that oral ingestion and sublingual ingestion are completely different ROA&#039;s.<br /><br />And as well I just remembered my fiance also ingested a similar amount herself (had with juice) and was fine.<br /><br />Worry gone. Also, just want to acknowledge the herping that happened in my previous post. Herper derper lol.<br /><br />Not sure if I want to try the sublingual route because of the taste. Hmmm..... How did you find the taste? That kinda thing can really ruin things for me if I get fixated on it.

It&#039;s odd that you are getting stronger effects orally, are you measuring your doses or just eyeballing them?<br />And I&#039;d just like to mention that, like many others, I&#039;ve had those two same revelations. Becoming God from my desk, and then thinking it was my time to die. Seems to be pretty common among higher doses of MXE.

				Anyone enjoy mixing their mxe with k? <br /><br />I did this the other week and it was really, really intense.

				I have the same problems, weed tends to bring the effects back slightly for me which is the exact opposite thing I want, a couple beers helps for me a little but I usually just have to end up waiting it out.

I indeed have felt tinges of mania on the comedown of a high dose. The afterglow, as well, but more subtly. I have heard comments of mania from both forums and real life friends. This may be a factor in the pleasantry of the comedown and afterglow, also.&nbsp; I have had the feeling I was having &#039;visions of grandeur&#039; (or at least wayyyyy too much confidence) after some heavy sessions. It is great having the confidence, though :D but either way, your mania comment is definitely valid...

However, since MXE is active at lower doses, one would hypothetically think &#039;lower doses, less damage&#039;. This is why you&#039;ll sometimes see MXE being advertised as a &#039;bladder-friendly alternative&#039; to ketamine. Now, I am not a chemist, but this statement just screams &#039;bullshit&#039; to me. They both share similar toxicity, and when one builds tolerance to MXE, they will have to take larger doses, thus creating more toxicity. Sure, MXE may be more bladder-friendly to someone who has never done dissociatives, but if you mix tolerance in there, i think not. i believe they are both toxic to your bladder and kidney. if done too much, i am pretty sure mxe could fuck your insides up just as bad as ket...but hey, what do i know? a lot of people think mxe is wayyyy less damaging than ket, and it very well may be...<br /><br />Also, they are very different, at least in my opinion. An m-hole and a k-hole are completely different animals. The biggest difference is that in a k-hole, you can&#039;t move / are anesthetized, while in an m-hole, you can walk around (sort of) like a mental patient :P<br /><br />honestly, i think everyone&#039;s bladder is different. some people seem to do large ket doses frequently with little damage, while others may sustain heavy damage from smaller doses over an extended period. now, this is just my personal theory, but after scouring clearnet, it seems at least some people share it...<br /><br />arylcyclohexylamines are fucking awesome, but in order to do them safely, you need to understand your body&#039;s limits...i, unfortunately, am learning this the hard way, as i assume many others have...<br /><br />65/g aint bad, either. i am pretty sure the ket you would get on the street for slightly cheaper or the same price would not be nearly as pure ( if it is, you got a great connect :D ) comparing mxe to ket prices is kind of silly because ket has been around on the streets for a long time, while mxe is a rather novel RC. RCs, as a rule of thumb, are usually cheaper than &#039;staple street drugs&#039; <br /><br /><br />@MailMaxDev: I do not prefer one over the other. different chems for different occasions...however, if i were to have to pick one and only one, k all the way!!! also, they are a pretty fun kombo :P oh, and the spacing thing...a week is a good rule of thumb between sessions, but seriously, find out whats good for your body...some people love doing the stuff daily then taking a break, some people love doing the stuff bi-weekly and not having to break for tolerance as much, and some people enjoy it once in a blue moon (hell, some people dont enjoy it all lol)...up to you, man :)<br /><br />i suggest this article for anyone that enjoys MXE, or any arylcyclohexylamines, for that matter:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.vice.com/read/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2 (excuse me if someone already mentioned it) the &#039;ketamine chemist&#039; invented mxe...pretty cool stuff...<br /><br /><br /><br />

Although that said I&#039;m a heavy diss user so the feeling of being thrown great distances and feeling as if you&#039;re somewhere else while remaining still might not be as enamoring to normal people :p

Last time I checked alcohol causes unsteadiness and caffeine causes agitation and a faster heart rate. Drugs can ruin people&#039;s lives when the become addicted and abuse them, just like if someone ignores real life in favor of playing video games all day or talking to their anime pillow. <br /><br />I&#039;ll freely admit I abused MXE for a long while and I never experienced any of those except &#039;unsteadiness&#039; which is normal on such drugs. I&#039;m not saying MXE doesn&#039;t have long term health problems but they&#039;re certainly not the ones posted and from what I&#039;ve seen you just seem to be here to slate MXE an drug use in general, what exactly are you looking for? No drug will provide a daily cure for depression as you asked for before and daily use of nearly any drug is unwise in the long term.

				Last night I resumed my MXE use after a three day break, two 30 mg lines.&nbsp; I was so fucked up by the time I made it to this party, and once I mixed weed and beer with it, I could barely walk.&nbsp; Even tried a few lines of coke for the first time.&nbsp; I think as long as you use MXE in moderation and moderate doses, no permanent damage should occur.

				My pet dinosaurs first time with MXE... <br /><br />I&#039;ll eyeball you, you look gentle and kind, I&#039;m not wary of you. You smell a little like some kind of soil I&#039;ve smelt before. Fly up my nose why don&#039;t you.....<br /><br />From what I have read I was expecting something similar to K.<br /><br />As I begin to the taste the chemical drip seep down my throat like some sort of delicious booger I don&#039;t really feel much, my palms&nbsp; are beginning to sweat though.<br /><br />Nature is calling me, outside it is a most beautiful autumn day. I feel as though I am a child again...<br /><br />I make some toast and tea and sit in the sun... WOW! The sun is incredible, I feel it&#039;s energy infusing me, I close my eyes and meditate for I don&#039;t know how long. Time is lost upon me.<br /><br />I open my eyes, HOLY SHIT! Everything is so distinct. I feel energized, I go inside and do some stretches and breathing exercises. I feel like a cloud.<br /><br />Lying on my back in the courtyard, the beige guttering from the house and the blue sky seem to blend together seamlessly. My eyes close and I am riding the gutter through the sky, the air and weightlessness is profound, this is an incredible feeling.<br /><br />Back inside I have some deep feeling thoughts, I want to experience the abstract as no one else has before, I want to think a thought&nbsp; that no one ever has.<br /><br />I put some shlohmo on, the bass pushes me down. I want to float on it. I am floating on it, the vibrations from the sub&nbsp; are so warm.<br /><br />There is something on my bed. It defies definition. I announce this to myself verbally as though I&#039;m in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean, viewing something that has never been seen before.<br /><br />I feel sociable, calm, loose and infused with energy. I have a strong urge to go swimming and call my friends.<br /><br />Reich, udaman! <br /><br />

				@candorean<br />MXE was banned in the UK just recently. That alone hurts supply but the ban is probably going to hit the US eventually. It&#039;ll still be out there but it will probably be much harder to find and more expensive and lower quality.

				An important note:<br />I&#039;ve discovered that as fun as it is MXE does not make for a good dance drug.&nbsp; <br /><br />I imagined dancing on MXE would be somewhat like alcohol, less inhibited and I would enjoy the music more, but I was at a party on MXE and I felt like a robot, dancing was nearly impossible.&nbsp; Even lower doses make my movements require more coordination.

				Aha here&#039;s that thread. Here&#039;s a post of mine Im copying from Kwiktrips review thread, has to do with mxe so...<br /><br />&quot;Here&#039;s a review for his mxe, I did some(almost 50mg dose) under my tongue about wednesday early morning. Lasted about 4-5 hours. I never did MXE before, but I have smoked PCP( or angeldust) back in the early 90s. This shit is pretty damn close an experience to that. It will fuck you up in a good way. MXE is basically in the same tranquilizer family as pcp, so I was kind of expecting that.<br /><br />Hell I was getting acid flashbacks, shroom flashbacks, pot flashbacks, anesthesia flashbacks from getting gassed when I had 4 four wisdom teeth pulled when I was in high school (long ago). Flashbacks when I was getting morphine shots when I broke my leg once. Swear to god. It was like I was doing all my past drugs at once. But it wasn&#039;t terrifying or anything. It was over all a nice feeling.<br /><br />It will make your vision double or triple, like you are drunk. It will fuck with your coordination and make you dizzy, but not enough to be sick or anything. And it does have somewhat of a hangover kick to it.<br /><br />But I have to say its good stuff, and It was fun doing it. I think he doesn&#039;t have any listed right now, but look for when he does.&quot;<br /><br />I also like to add overall I found MXE like a mix between being really drunk and PCP high.&nbsp; It also reminded me of that famous youtube clip with dad videoing his kid in his car after dental surgery LOL. Yep MXE can fuck you up alright...in a good way I might add... In a good way.

				It&#039;ll take me some time till I can scan through the 22 pages of discussion on this subject (But believe me I will)<br /><br />MXE. Fascinating stuff.<br />Very good at preventing excitotoxic responses (Any NMDA Receptor antagonist does this)<br />I never really tried Angel Dust (the PCPs), Ketamine, or any other arylcyclohexylamines until MXE..<br />Mostly, my Dissociative of Choice (I have a chronic excitotoxic condition, which requires administration of NMDA receptor antagonists) over the years was Dextromethorphan potentiated with Clorpheneramine Maleate (As in the infamous CCC pills.. but damn, the shellac and povidone and shit in those pills feels nasty on the body. LNK International makes the best generic &#039;Skittles&#039; these days.. But still.. I digress, and I don&#039;t care for all the shellac and dye)..<br />So, MXE feels different cause it doesn&#039;t do anything (AFAIK) to the mu-opioid receptor (While DXM mildly agonizes it).<br />And there&#039;s not the Nor-epinephrine Dopamine Reputake Inhibition effect of CPM.. But.. Still MXE fascinates me.<br /><br />Until I get my hands on some HU-211, this is definitely one of my DoCs (And actually, an ordered &#039;black&#039; prescription)

				I gave describing my experience with a seriously large dose of MXE another go. I spent a lot of time trying to describe it and hopefully this does a good job.<br /><br />I felt like an Indian god because I had 12 hands. I could feel each one as it froze into existence and then faded away. My body image was not altered, it was destroyed.<br /><br />It was as if someone had turned the refresh rate down in the matrix. A trail of my body was left as I moved, quantized to some invisible grid.<br /><br />I had experienced tracers before: the lingering visual artifact of movement, like the blob left in your eyes after getting your picture taken. Move your hand – you can see it sober. But this was different. Someone had turned on an internal strobe light in my brain as I moved.<br /><br />Everything looked distant like the zoom and focus was off on the camera in my brain or as if I were looking through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars. This became so intense that I left my body entirely.<br /><br />I stared at my body and my room as if from above, which had taken on a romantic, William S. Burroughs atmosphere to it. The glare of my computer screen barely illuminated my distant body, which now began to buzz in and out of existence. I marveled at how cool it looked, how deviant, heroin-chic everything seemed. And then I opened my eyes.<br /><br />The sound of my air filter became harsh until it screeched and throbbed and scraped like scrap metal beating against a malfunctioning air conditioning unit. In short, it was the most fascinating noise music I had ever heard.<br /><br />I found myself walking, but I couldn&#039;t feel my limbs move. It felt as if I were on stilts, or rather that my legs themselves had become stilts. I found my limbs snapping into place and resonating like a tuning fork or a stiff spring. Basically, I felt like a robot moving with abrupt, mechanical and effortful movement.<br /><br />I found my way from my bed to my computer. It seemed miles away and the buzzing noise in my head (now no longer related to my air filter) grew increasingly oppressive and loud. My body had only a vague position in space. I could feel quantum uncertainty rushing through it like waves rushing over the beach.<br /><br />When I focused on a key on my keyboard, it grew large as if a magnifying glass were being held to it. This made it hard for me to figure out the key&#039;s exact position and as I went to strike a key I would invariably miss.<br /><br />At this point I found it best to lie down again. I began to vibrate and glitch violently. I could no longer focus my eyes properly. It seemed as if I were sitting on a couch watching a television and someone was shaking the camera. This was quite different from shaking one&#039;s head or the blurriness and tunnel vision of drinking too much.<br /><br />At this point my body image became so distorted that as I listened to music I could feel each note move through my body. The music and I melded together into a singular sensation. I was enveloped in the music like a warm blanket.<br /><br />I liken what happened next to being on a television set, lying on the bed, when all of a sudden the grips pick up and take away the walls to the set, and a the lights go dim and zoom in one your body lying on the bed with a bright spotlight and then zooms out again to reveal that the bed and the stage have entirely disappeared. I&#039;m&nbsp; flying over a surrealist landscape of sound at this point.<br /><br />It felt as if I was now fully anesthetized, especially on nitrous, being numb to the world and your surroundings, only MXE is different. It&#039;s related to Ketamine and nitrous which are used as anesthetics and it felt as if I was anesthetized, except I could still move and I could still think. I wasn&#039;t able to simply recall these feeling later, I was fully aware of them at the time, thinking with clarity and focus.<br /><br />The world was dissolved into an infinitely complex Picasso painting and as if in a dream I was aware of the details only when I focused on them. But when I did, each detail was as complex as the whole and was in and of itself a barely decipherable cubist masterpiece. This marked the beginning of experiencing something too complex for words to describe properly. The only way I can put it is that it felt as if I were moving in and out of a hundred dimensions.

In which case it&#039;s kinda out of date now as the batches have shifted several times now. The current one is quite nice and the last one I picked up before the UK ban. It&#039;s more fluffy but with small clumps and seems similar to the original stuff I was stocking, not the stuff I described in the quote above. Sorry about not updating here but it&#039;s really manic for me now with keep up to date on everything. <br /><br />When I started MXE I think I first tried like 30mg but I used to using disassociates anyway so I was used to the effect, I can&#039;t really give dosage guides nowadays because obviously due to my position I tend to have a very high and random tolerance compared to other people. <br /><br />Also to cerealbox that&#039;s a very nice post, reminds me much of one I had a while ago, some of the trips can be very beautiful.

I did find some BOMB MXE on the clearnet tho. it was from www.wide-mouth-frogs.com but they had to quit selling it because of the ban. but they got some other good research chemicals. but I usually bought 10 grams at a time. and I have been looking for some on SR that is good quality because I am use to really good quality.

				After ketamine vanished from the UK market a few months ago MXE was being sold in litres as K. took a huge dose as this is what i&#039;m used to with K and all i can say is i might as well have taken a sheet of acid. was definitely an unwanted surprise but after i came off it a bit it became quite enjoyable, definitely won&#039;t take as large a dose again though as it&#039;s quite strong.

				I&#039;m continuing to look for a good dose and ROA for me.

The come-up was also pretty fast, about +20 minutes before it came on stronger than my plugging experience.

I don&#039;t think I&#039;d enjoy the m-hole very much because of the confusion at higher doses, but other than that I absolutely love this chemical. It makes me feel like my head has expanded ten thousand-fold and I have all the time and room in the world to think.<br /><br />And your product is so potent, too!

				25mg buccal/sublingual is actually a pretty moderate dose for an experienced dissociative user... I&#039;ve gotten pretty good at acting 100% sober. There&#039;s sometimes a bit of slurring but I slur naturally anyway.<br /><br />Splitting the dose into a morning 15 and a midday 10 works pretty nicely too. Unfortunately I tend to bump more often than I should... I am fairly new to MXE and I&#039;m already hooked! Be careful, because if MXE is anything like ketamine it IS addictive, but not nearly as bad as, say, caffeine!

If you want to have a pretty decent trip on the weekend without getting too confused, I&#039;d recommend taking 50mg&#039;s sublingually with 10-15mg bumps snorted every hour and a half or so after. As for what to do while tripping, meditation and music therapy is perfect! ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m still too poor to afford Ketamine but am excited for the day I finally get the chance too! From what I heard though, you should try MXE before K because otherwise it may come off as underwhelming. So get as much enjoyment as you can from a gram or so of MXE, then move on to the richer experience that Ketamine holds within! :D

If you want to have a pretty decent trip on the weekend without getting too confused, I&#039;d recommend taking 50mg&#039;s sublingually with 10-15mg bumps snorted every hour and a half or so after. As for what to do while tripping, meditation and music therapy is perfect! ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m still too poor to afford Ketamine but am excited for the day I finally get the chance too! From what I heard though, you should try MXE before K because otherwise it may come off as underwhelming. So get as much enjoyment as you can from a gram or so of MXE, then move on to the richer experience that Ketamine holds within! :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />IMO I was glad I had ketamine before MXE in my book MXE is a much more interesting substance, that&#039;s more potent.&nbsp; I also prefer that I only have to snort a max of 80-100mg, as with K I have 70mg in each nostril and repeat with 30mg bumps every 45 mins. (seems alot more habit forming due to short duration and I HATE putting shit up my nose.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway I hope Ketamine is everything you expect, because MXE sure was for me =)

				I&#039;ve had both 3Janes and Reichs Ketamine and also Reichs MXE and I have to say I find them quite different. MXE effects me much more psychologically, giving me quite a psychedelic reaction especially at a high dose. I also become very child like and everything just seems soft, hilarious and zany. The most intense psych experience I&#039;ve ever had was on 100-150mg of reichs, snuffed. Very, very intense and scary at times but all the same really freaking incredible. Glad I found my way back.<br /><br />Ketamine really just makes me feel limp and completely numbed, like a rag doll minus trippyness and child like perspective although a much stronger body load, it is ofcourse a tranq.&nbsp; I do admit I haven&#039;t taken it at high doses like I have with MXE.<br /><br />I also agree 100% with Reichs comment above.

				Had some MXE + 2C-E last night. I started off with 10mg of MXE oral (dissolved and drank with some coconut water). Once the numbing affects kicked in I plugged 5mg of 2c-e. As expected, I avoided the infamous body load. The rest, however, was very unexpected. <br /><br />First off, no visuals at all and our mindspace was clear the entire time. Hubby had about 50mg of MXE insufflated and 15mg of 2c-e plugged. <br /><br />NOTE: we went for plugged because 2c&#039;s are twice as potent that way and in the event that it turned out to be a bad trip, it would be a shorter time to baseline. But there was nothing bad or negative about this trip, if you can even call it tripping. <br /><br />We ended up experiencing this profound sense of peace and serenity. We kept wondering if we were sober but knew we weren&#039;t because of how clean and clear our minds and thought processes were. Negative thoughts or emotions were snuffed before having a chance to materialize. It was positive but not overly or forced; the serenity just flowed. At one point we listened to &quot;Don&#039;t Worry, Be Happy&quot; and both noted that it perfectly described what we were experiencing but without the usual sarcasm that the song normally implies. Music was very nice and we connected with every song. <br /><br />Everything was just complete, whole, and right. The phrase &quot;but it&#039;s ok, everything is ok&quot; was said often. We felt we were on the verge of going into hyperdrive but didn&#039;t really want or feel the need to take more because we were in such a good place. It took the anti-depressant affect of MXE to a new level. <br /><br />In any case, I might up the 2c-e dose to 10mg next time, we&#039;ll see. I almost don&#039;t want to do that combo again because everything was perfect. But I have 80mg left so I&#039;ll probably go back to it eventually.

				When I combined 2C-B and MXE a few days ago the MXE almost immediately blunted my visuals and it sobered my euphoria. It didn&#039;t ruin my trip but it changed it in a way that wasn&#039;t to my expectations. I was expecting a cool body high and perhaps a greater ability to philosophize, but instead I slowed down the wonderful chaos of 2C-B... I don&#039;t plan on combining the two again.

I still show no signs of addiction either as I&#039;ve been off it a few days now and am feeling better than ever!

				Next time you take MXE: try meditating.<br /><br />I did it under just 30mg and it was one of the most profound experiences of my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />I felt the universe as a pulsating plane, a sort of unity between the finite and the infinite, and felt myself as part of it.<br /><br />Take 20 minutes or so and look up how to meditate beforehand, it is definitely a worthwhile experience.

The first time it felt like there was a small black hole in my living room or vacuum sucking at my skin, which also felt rubbery or fake. its hard to explain...dont remember very much.(check my sig) But tonight i tried again, and not taking any MDMA this time i smoked a little weed, so it might have enhanced the MXE effect, but when it kicked in, it was as if my life&#039;s purpose was coming into focus and the people in my life are there for a reason. They exist for me to accomplish whatever it is i am trying to accomplish in my life.&nbsp; I got the feeling that things were falling into my lap that i have been dreaming about accomplishing/becoming reality for a very long time. A feeling that the world was created for me (as it was for each of us) .&nbsp; I felt like i had finally made it to the &quot;other side&quot; wherever that happy place is. Also got a feeling, that there is no such thing as death, rather more like being born into an afterlife where everything is as it should be.&nbsp; But with this insight also comes the knowledge that i may exist to help the people in my life find their path to happiness.&nbsp; Other sensations or for lack of correct terminology &quot;powers&quot; i felt the drug gives me the ability to control things i would not otherwise have control of and by listening to what the drug is telling me to do, it is helping me manifest my destiny as fate has planned for me or as i would want it to happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now that i am sober, this all sounds really far fetched, but somewhere in my heart, i still feel like there is a lot more to this drug than i could have ever possibly imagined.

				had 200mg dose made (sorry to be generic) that scene from fear and loathing in las vegas look like a Disney film.<br />My body moved in shapes and ways that I didn&#039;t think were humanly possible.

I was hopping for more dissotiative effects, I might try some IV but want to get my tolerance back up, right now its crazy high I went through about 10 grams of k this month just at weekend partys and raves and I think mxe and k have a cross tolerance.

				I find the best ROAs for MXE are buccal and intramuscular. Buccal administration seems to be more efficient than oral or intranasal administration, with about the same effects as intranasal, i.e. comeup time and duration, subjective effects. Intramuscular administration is much more potent and gives a slightly different experience, in addition to having a shorter duration and comeup time. I like to use intramuscular for holeing and buccal for partying/getting a buzz. Insufflation is OK, but not necessary.

Except beyond seeing and traveling, we felt connected or one with whatever we were seeing/experiencing at the time. We had no sense of our bodies but this was very bodily at the same time. If we saw wind, we could feel it and breathe it. <br /><br />Imagine the entire world dissolving away: all fear, worry, anxiety, regret, doubt. Your entire life culminates to this one point in time and everything makes sense. Beyond feeling bliss, you are the epitome of bliss. Your life dissolves and you become the universe, free to explore the vast depths of your mind. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a full trip report: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28015.msg325329#msg325329<br /><br />NOTE: we are both extremes, I&#039;m a total lightweight and he is incredibly naturally tolerant to most psychedelics. So for dosing, take whatever dose of MXE you normally take for a not-too-hard trip and add an equal amount of 2C-C. The 1:1 ratio works for the total immersion experience though I&#039;ll probably try to lower the MXE dose in the future to see how the trip changes when I&#039;m free to move around more.

				So Dr. Gonzo being the badass that he is sent me a free sample of .5 of MXE. And being the curious person that I am, I indulged today for the first time. Only took a few key bumps. I felt really great during the initial ~45min to an hour or so, getting increasingly more loopy as time went on.. I really think that if I took any more I would have gone to a really bad place, so I didn&#039;t take any more after the initial bumps. I see how it is similar to ketamine in the dissociative aspect, my speech got kind of jumbled and I bumped into a few things and everything seemed so dreamy... music was just music, not anything better than usual to be honest and it was just a weird high in my opinion. Having done ketamine a handful of times before one of the only ways I can describe it is that my brain feels like scrambled eggs when I&#039;m on either of these drugs. o_O I smoked a bowl while I was fucked up and that increased the high quite a bit, but yeah, for me drugs like this just seem like something to try, like salvia. Sure they fuck you up, not particularly in a good/super enjoyable way,&nbsp; but just kind of a straaaange/loopy/weird way. Hm, I guess dissociatives just aren&#039;t my cup of tea. I wish I liked it more, because Dr. Gonzo is a bamf for hooking it up for free like that! I noticed on his listing how it says &quot;be careful because this stuff has some balls.&quot; Heed this warning my friends, heeeeeeeeeeeed......

				I rarely take enough MXE that I&#039;m bumping into things. With smaller doses, it&#039;s an anesthetic which is good if you&#039;re having body aches. It also gives you a boost in terms of focus and productivity. For me, this isn&#039;t so apparent until the next day when I&#039;m extra productive and have an increased desire to get tasks done. It also boosts my mood which is great for cranky week. <br /><br />Though sniffing will give you a different affect. You might try drinking or parachuting it next time. <br /><br />When taking the higher doses, it&#039;s not one to walk around with. It&#039;s more of a meditative drug at that point to lie down and follow your thoughts wherever they lead. It&#039;s a traveling-without-moving kind of thing. At least hubby will get racing thoughts. He says his problems and issues become a puzzle in his head and he&#039;s able to move the pieces around and see how they fit better. He gets a fresh perspective and is better able to deal the next day. <br /><br />If you really want some fun, add a little 2c-c to it and lie down with some music playing in the background. I hear it&#039;s even better with tryptamines but I haven&#039;t tried it yet. <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m still waiting on my sample. I&#039;m hoping I get it today!

				All I&#039;ve got to say is WOW! I have a pretty crazy dissociative tolerance, but DrGonzo, your current batch of MXE is slamming me into the ground! Just railed 25mg and I&#039;m all tingly. It&#039;s more powdery than before and it has some tan flakes in it so I thought it might have been less pure, but apparently not!<br /><br />Good stuff, much better than the sample you last sent me.

				I just got awakened&#039;s MXE and I&#039;d like to do a quick comparison between it, DrGonzo&#039;s, and reich&#039;s, now that I&#039;ve had a chance to test them all.<br /><br />awakened - very crystalline and white, hard to distinguish from table salt. Does not burn whatsoever when insufflated. Tastes very salty. 25mg provided a good high. Much more on the sedating side. I think this MXE has been washed. A little too pricey for my tastes, but definitely good MXE.<br /><br />DrGonzo - fluffy and off-white powder with some orangeish-tanish flakes in it. Burns a bit when insufflated. Does not taste very salty, more bitter. 25mg provided an excellent high. A bit stimulating. I don&#039;t think this MXE has been washed. Good price for the effects, and good MXE.<br /><br />reich (RIP) - crystalline and white, but smaller crystals that awakened&#039;s. Burned slightly when insufflated. Tasted very salty. 25mg provided an excellent high. A bit stimulating. reich said that the batch in question had not been washed, and the effects confirm it, but it appears as if it has been. Excellent price for the effects, and good MXE.<br /><br />Summary: reich had the best value, but DrGonzo has the strongest product for the money now. However his MXE might have that cathinone found in some of the chinese MXE batches, due to its appearance and the slight stimulation. awakened&#039;s MXE appears to be unadulterated, but it&#039;s quite expensive. Honestly if reich were back I&#039;d order his again, but both DrGonzo and awakened have very good products and it&#039;s hard to choose which of them to pick! :)

				I drank 20mg of gonzo&#039;s MXE and found it more euphoric than Reich&#039;s. Like pools, I also found it a bit stimulating (I normally feel groggy on Reich&#039;s stuff). It didn&#039;t make me as thirsty or nauseous if that means anything; I&#039;m sure pools would be able to deduct something from that. <br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t comment on taste, I mix this stuff with juice so I don&#039;t have to taste it, lol.

				Sweet! I just got back from my job interview and found Gonzo&#039;s MXE and Omnis&#039;s DMT waiting for me at my drop-off! Both we&#039;re typical shipping methods, but hey...If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it right? ;D I&#039;ve been watching the weather and it looks like I&#039;m in for thunderstorms for the rest of the week which in my opinion, is prime stay-at-home weather perfect for DMT and MXE. Hopefully it starts raining sooner than expected so I can dive right into my drug-fueled adventures and murder my ego. ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m super excited and anxious to try DMT on MXE, but I have no idea what to expect. Anyone have any experience with it? I think I&#039;ll just look it up and see if anyone has on bluelight or erowid. We should come up with a name for it, like space-flip or something like that. :P

While under my tongue is much more relaxed blissful, and more drawn-out experience. Snorting is fun for video games or for going out and riding my bike to music, but sublingual is better for just laying down on my comfy bed and floating away on a cloud to Pink Floyd and thinking about life. :)) I use bigger doses for snorting so I try not to do it often, maybe once a week or so I&#039;ll snort it. The taste is so much more horrid from snorting too, but so long as you have a flavored drink the drip isn&#039;t too bad. Especially compared to the drip of other substances! :o

It brings out the psychedelia of ketamine a lot more too. OEVs besides flanging? Yes please.<br /><br />I found that MXE+coke is actually an amazing speedball. Bump MXE 1-2 times, then rail a line or two... the numbness all over your body is soooo good, plus the rush is amazing. The MXE helps with the comedown of the coke if you have a problem with that, because it&#039;s anxiolytic. I would imagine other stimulants would mix well with MXE as well. Actually, now that I think of it, draw up an IM dose of MXE, just shy of the hole... take it, then rail a fuckload of coke or PV or whatever you like, then dance... yeah. I don&#039;t normally like coke but with MXE I make an exception.<br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t like MXE with PEAs though. Seems to dull 2C-x trips, makes rolling lazier and less magical, and I don&#039;t like it with amphetamines that much... I take Adderall for narcolepsy so amphetamines have lost their recreational value for me, but I think mentioning it in light of 2C-x and MDMA might help you draw a better conclusion.<br /><br />Oh, and it goes without saying that you should never mix alcohol and dissociatives. Fucking with your NMDA receptors that much is a great way to die from choking on your own vomit.<br /><br />Hope my 2 cents help you find a fun way to enjoy MXE... personally if nothing else I think you should try it IM! Quite a fun ride :)

				Gonzo ran out when I was ready to buy more so I got some from Awakened. I&#039;m just getting around to trying it and wow, no words.<br /><br />I drank 10mg and it has the feel of Reich&#039;s stuff but at least twice as potent if not more so. My ears are ringing and I feel like I&#039;m on the edge of a hole, lol. <br /><br />So my current opinion is:<br /><br />Gonzo is good if you&#039;re taking it casually for social reasons. It will give you a very euphoric and clear-headed trip. <br /><br />Awakened is good if you want to fly away. A little goes a long way and it WILL make you blast off! I can&#039;t wait to add some 2c-c to this stuff!

				For those of you who haven&#039;t checked it out yet, Tunbear (new UK vendor) is having an introductory special, about 3 coins for 1 gram. I just got my shipment today, took 6 days (including the weekend) and weighed almost double what I ordered. Shipping was basic yet discrete, couldn&#039;t tell there was a baggie in it. I&#039;ll report on quality tomorrow. <br /><br />So far it looks good, completely white, no clumps, and no off-what speckles (like Reich&#039;s stuff). Consistency is sort of between powder and Awakened&#039;s shards, kind of hard to explain. I think I would still call it powder as it&#039;s finer than Awakend&#039;s stuff but it&#039;s not fluff either. <br /><br />UPDATE: I tried to dissolve his stuff last night and it has a strange sandy quality. It would not dissolve. I&#039;ve read about MXE like this before where not even heat will dissolve it so I&#039;m not sure what it means for those of you who enjoy snorting. For drinkers it means a slower come-up, longer plateau, and more gradual come-down ... I can&#039;t really gauge potency yet, I was definitely having a tolerance issue from the other day. But I&#039;ll try to take a big enough break so I can comment on it soon.

				I&#039;ve been trying other vendors&#039; MXE over the past couple of weeks. Let me make a quick comment or two:<br /><br />FatBurger - his MXE was yellowish and more granular than other batches I&#039;ve had - a bit more yellow than I&#039;ve known MXE to normally be. I was a little suspicious but it was definitely MXE. It felt decently potent and barely had any weird salty taste, which to my understanding is preferable with MXE. He&#039;s a new vendor and had trouble getting it sent out but he was very polite and if he gets a better batch I would probably order with him again; personally I just felt his stuff was a bit too weak. To its credit, it was very inexpensive.<br /><br />I also bought from buy-jwh. It was also yellowish but much more powdery and it had some caramel-color flakes in it... it actually looked a lot like DrGonzo&#039;s, so I wonder if they have the same supplier. Could be just a coincidence. I haven&#039;t sampled it yet, but I&#039;ll be sure to comment later. I&#039;m on a T-break after having binged for the past two weeks.

				A little update on the vendor: Tunbear. He had 2 different batches and upon find out which one I got, he is promptly reshipping my order. Apparently one of them was not the purity he promised so I&#039;m getting a reship! <br /><br />Anyway, will update on quality once it comes in. I&#039;ll be taking a break from MXE until it does so I&#039;ll be primed to give a complete review sometime next week.

				My Tunbear reship arrived yesterday (which is amazing since he shipped it from the UK on Thursday). As a vendor, Tunbear is generous, honest, and I recommend him highly. I drank 10ml of his MXE over an hour ago and am in a VERY nice place. <br /><br />This stuff is on par with Awakend&#039;s MXE (not an easy thing to accomplish).&nbsp; The quality, potency, and affects are identical. Tunbears shards are a lot smaller than Awakened&#039;s, otherwise I&#039;d suspect that they had the same supplier. <br /><br />If you only had Reich&#039;s stuff, start with half your normal dose though even then you might be working your way down, hehe.

				The IV solution is 20mL @50mg/mL. It really depends because IV is completely different from administering nasally. You would have to try it out yourself, but start low. Try 15-20 units to start.

				@bongon - Tunbear started off with two batches. One was cut which is why there was mixed reviews. If you received the one that didn&#039;t dissolve in water, contact him for a reship. <br /><br />I started off with the cut batch which didn&#039;t dissolve in water and upon contacting him he sent me a reship. The second dissolved easily in water and it was the same potency/affects as Awakened&#039;s MXE. They&#039;re both easily 2-3x as potent as Reich&#039;s stuff (I say 2 and others say as much as 3x though I don&#039;t take as much as others do). And if you check Tunbear&#039;s thread, there are numerous reports about the reships being incredibly potent. <br /><br />@Soccerpros Both Awakened and Tunbear have the best MXE on the road. Awakened is in the US and Tunbear is in the UK. Currently, Awakened only ships to the US and Tunbear has free international shipping. I vouch for them both.

My friend took 50mg then another 50mg an hour later under his tongue. Apparently he forgot what happened for about 2-3 hours. Is that normal? He vaguely remembers having some delusions about &quot;going insane&quot; and &quot;dying&quot; but he can&#039;t really remember anything. Maybe he took too much? I was interested in trying it but not if I&#039;m gonna forget everything. I should mention he was riding a weed afterglow, but nothing major (several hours had passed since he smoked).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>50mg is a very large dose for a beginner. Start in increments of 25mg IMO, unless you are very small, in which case, do 20mg increments. MXE is at least 20% more potent by mass than Ketamine and it lasts a hell of a lot longer.

				Heyo guys, thanks for explaining my issues and reassuring people my cleared batch is indeed the real deal.<br /><br />The stuff that doesn&#039;t dissolve is called matrix - it&#039;s an MXE 20%/something else 80% and this was sold so people could do big lines like with ket, and not get in a deep hole.<br /><br />If you drop some in a glass and it disappears then it&#039;s MXE, sometimes a few rocks will settle on the bottom, just break it up and mix it up, it should all disappear, that is pure MXE, what I am currently offering.<br /><br />Reich was paying about £1500/kilo if not less (he was a major importer of it) so he could do those prices, as he could import as much as he wanted. That&#039;s why his prices went up towards the end, because importing it isn&#039;t an option anymore (he&#039;s a legit business man).

				Side effects is a hard one to call on a drug like this. It depends how much you use it, but I&#039;d have to wager that if you&#039;re taking a drug like this often it&#039;s going to cause some serious issues, but..<br />&nbsp;<br />It&#039;s addictive. It&#039;s been said by several people who have used it far too often, and for a while I was using it to stop withdrawal effects from opiates, and it got to a point where I couldn&#039;t get sleep without it.<br /><br />It causes kidney stones! It causes a build up of something in your kidneys which creates kidney stones, but takes a while.<br /><br />Mental problems I&#039;d wager - I used it as a getaway from problems in life and I found it way too easy to just go into a hole with it...you lose a lot of &quot;senses&quot; that you don&#039;t normally with ketamine..like concepts of time, logic etc. so it makes you just become a shell of a person, which depending how your current mental state is, might become the preferable state to be in.<br /><br />Generally though it&#039;s not a drug I&#039;d recommend for habitual use.

You can buy one and ill guarantee youll like it. If not u can voice your displeasure or u can contact me and we can sort things out. I am 100% positive this wont happen. Its really fun in this form!

				I&#039;ve ordered from awakened and reich once or twice each. Both were good. A little different from batch to batch and seller to seller, but the experienced difference was...intangible. Slight difference in texture as well. Both were great, great shipping times and stealthy shipping (opened reich&#039;s in front of the &#039;rents, no real problem).<br /><br />I loved it at first and still do. The experience is a blast and the anti-depressant effect lasts for a few days after. Awesome stuff. Definitely more-ish though, so watch out. My advice on it though, don&#039;t sleep on it. I did about 150-225 mg one time, had a great night, felt i was coming down, passed out. Woke up 7 hours later completely disoriented, couldn&#039;t identify a ceiling fan, couldn&#039;t read (though i knew in my mind what the word said), things were spinning, and i had the weird idea that everything was...oriental? best way i can put it lol. Lasted for a few hours even after waking (which was 8+ hours after dosing). Balance was off, speech was slurred, world was unstable. Everyone around me knew something was seriously up, but i said it was extreme fatigue. Didn&#039;t completely buy it, but still. I said things I don&#039;t remember, did things i don&#039;t remember. Had to make a conscious effort to keep my mouth shut because of what would come out. <br /><br />Yeah, i took it too far. But I&#039;ve taken a couple month break and will be careful when putting it back in rotation. deal with it wisely and you&#039;ll love it.

Anybody know of possible unwanted short-term/long-term side effects? I don&#039;t trust drugs that don&#039;t have a long history.<br /><br /><br />Cheers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I can tell you what I&#039;m getting personally.<br /><br />For starters, after a bit of regular use (2+ doses daily for 7+ days), I noticed my hearing was not as clear. It was hard to understand human speech and audio fidelity was reduced. After 3-4 days of no use, hearing returned to normal (and it was quite nice).<br /><br />There is also some bladder strain. I find that I am urinating less and sometimes I have a little pain in my bladder. I see a urologist and they found nothing wrong with me, but I think their sonogram is just not very good. My use has been pretty... heavy... so I don&#039;t think using this drug once a month will give you any problems.<br /><br />To expand on the bladder problem: I am also experiencing fairly consistent diarrhea. Basically, my shit&#039;s on the runny side usually. I haven&#039;t noticed myself urinating too much less frequently, but I am peeing a bit less, and shitting a bit more. I think my minor bladder problems are causing my excess hydration to exit via my feces. In other words, I&#039;m pissing out my ass (a bit). All of this is pretty minor so far but it&#039;s begun to be quite scary so I&#039;m determined to stop using MXE for a while.<br /><br />MXE is definitely addictive, but not nearly as much as any other addictive drug I&#039;ve ever had: alcohol, benzos, opioids, GHB, tobacco, etc. I&#039;d say it&#039;s a bit more addictive than amphetamine (which I don&#039;t find very addictive) and ketamine (which again I don&#039;t find very addictive). It definitely is a great antidepressant and I found myself using it as a crutch, which led to some reliance and a bit of a compulsive habit. I&#039;ve been off it for like 3 days now, and I don&#039;t have any cravings but I really miss it!<br /><br />I also found that MXE sometimes made my blood sugar dip. No idea why that would happen, but it is what it is. (I&#039;m a diabetic so this might not apply to most of you.)

				I tried MXE for the first time over the weekend, and found it to be extremely unpleasant. With any drug I&#039;m new to, I start off very slowly, and work my way up. So, I started off with 10mg oral. I felt a warmish body buzz, but that was about it. Went to sleep easily with slightly strange dreams all night. Next night, I took 15mg oral, and had pretty much the same experience.<br /><br />The third night, I decided on 15mg IV. This time I was able to strongly feel the effect of the drug, but while not at all frightening, I didn&#039;t like it at all. Physically, it felt as if I&#039;d had way too much to drink. Nausea, found it difficult to walk straight. A feeling I don&#039;t enjoy. Mentally, it hardly did anything. I felt a slight detachment from my body that&#039;s hard to describe, but mostly I left bored and like I was missing something.<br /><br />The next day, I felt none of the afterglow I&#039;d read so much about, although I didn&#039;t have any hangover to speak of either. The boredom combined with the nausea made me decide I wasn&#039;t interested in the drug again.

				15mg is nothing. Seriously I don&#039;t even feel anything until 20-30mg. I consider 60-90mg a good trip with MXE. Any higher than that and things get really intense and confusing.

Never on such a low dose, but tolerance was undoubtedly in effect. At 50-75 mg it combined well imo. Drinking made me loosen up the experience and I was more willing to let myself go and enjoy the experience without being as hyper-attentive or scrutinizing the drug&#039;s effects as closely. Instead of &quot;wow i feel this or wow i feel that&quot; it seemed to help me assimilate the mxe more naturally into whatever I was doing. At higher doses and with more alcohol, you won&#039;t want to be trying to do a whole lot but it&#039;s great fun. Allows for even more &quot;oneness&quot; with it, for lack of a better term.<br />Definitely give it a try if you&#039;ve done mxe a few times by itself and enjoy it. It&#039;s absolutely worth testing for yourself, so long as you do not get totally sloshed. Both in moderation.

				I take small eye-balled dosage of MXE to give my mood a lift, while maintaining functionality.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t find MXE addictive, but I will say that while on MXE, you are prone to take more MXE especially if you&#039;re having a good time.&nbsp; So know before hand how much you&#039;re willing to take in that one session otherwise if you have enough on hand, you&#039;ll keep redosing til you&#039;re confuse, wild, and stumbling about, maybe that&#039;s what you want, but your head will probably hurt the day after.&nbsp; Be safe, be happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				I&nbsp; vended&nbsp; MXE in the past, MXE is one of the weirdest drugs I have ever tried and I have tried many. It was weird weird weird! It did not make me feel good in any way, but only slightly bad. It was more psychedelic than K but still not a drug I would do unless I was suck in a hole for a very long time or I wanted a cheap way to enhance a trip. I do tend to like most drugs except Methylone, for some reason it puts me in a bad mood. I don&#039;t like MDPV as well but I don&#039;t think many people like it either.

You will find that blacking out and vomiting occur much more easily and you may die. I had a friend who overdid the MXE when he was drunk and we had to keep him from choking on his own puke for 6 hours.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4685.msg442963#msg442963">Quote from: Banjo on August 31, 2012, 10:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I tried MXE for the first time over the weekend, and found it to be extremely unpleasant. With any drug I&#039;m new to, I start off very slowly, and work my way up. So, I started off with 10mg oral. I felt a warmish body buzz, but that was about it. Went to sleep easily with slightly strange dreams all night. Next night, I took 15mg oral, and had pretty much the same experience.<br /><br />The third night, I decided on 15mg IV. This time I was able to strongly feel the effect of the drug, but while not at all frightening, I didn&#039;t like it at all. Physically, it felt as if I&#039;d had way too much to drink. Nausea, found it difficult to walk straight. A feeling I don&#039;t enjoy. Mentally, it hardly did anything. I felt a slight detachment from my body that&#039;s hard to describe, but mostly I left bored and like I was missing something.<br /><br />The next day, I felt none of the afterglow I&#039;d read so much about, although I didn&#039;t have any hangover to speak of either. The boredom combined with the nausea made me decide I wasn&#039;t interested in the drug again. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I feel that you could have approached the substance better. For starters, dissociatives build a tolerance quickly. Taking 10mg one day and 15mg the next day are pretty much going to do exactly the same thing for most people. I normally recommend 25-30mg for a starting oral dose, and 20-25mg for sublingual. (By the way, sublingual is a better starting ROA for this drug.)<br /><br />Also, IV MXE is... troublesome. It is much too fast of a comeup for me to be able to wade through the headspace effectively. Even IM shots tend to be a little confusing. You probably gave your body a fair bit of a shock...<br /><br />I&#039;d say give it one more shot and take 25mg in bumps either in the nose, or better, sublingually/buccally, until you get to a nice place. It&#039;s a good way to pace yourself and it helps you wade into the dissociation comfortably and stay in control, which is always nice when delving into dissociative psychedelia.

				Do you think MXE will ever be banned? It&#039;s not an analogue of a schedule I or II substance so it can&#039;t be banned that way. It would have to be at a state level and no one has died from it in USA so I don&#039;t see why they would ban it other than to be assholes.

				I have no reason not give him the benefit of the doubt. I am in escrow so I&#039;m not worried. I haven&#039;t really messaged him either. I can wait until I am close to the auto-finalize date to bug him about it, but I have a feeling it will simply be here by now.

				Hello folks sorry for not being online, I just haven&#039;t had the time.<br /><br />Some of you deserve a full explanation - the person that died is my fiance&#039;s gran. My fiance was raised by this woman, she lived with her from the age of about 3 to 18 when her gran put her through university. As you can magine this is like her own mother dying. It has absolutely devastated her and I was worried she was actually suicidal. <br /><br />I let Silk Road take too much of a back seat which wasn&#039;t fair to a lot of people, as it tied up your money, to which I deeply apologize. Most people who were left waiting were either given 2x their order or some extra depending on how long they were left waiting.<br /><br />Also as a side note, with the vlad1m1r scam I lost out on a lot of money which left me nothing to post stuff, so I used a mate&#039;s business to send a large consignment of orders. However, as God hates me this got destroyed in some frankly FUCKED UP freak accident.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not going to explain what happened, those affected know it. HOWEVER, I will NOT TOLERATE BEING CALLED A FUCKING LIAR.<br /><br />Any CUNT who calls me a liar will be refunded and will be banned from future purchases. This might seem unprofessional, however I didn&#039;t take this tone to those users, this is the forum and is much more personal, so am speaking frankly.<br /><br />The person above, if it is who I think it is, didn&#039;t take the option for a refund, they called me a bullshitter so I apologized for them being let down and cancelled their order, they didn&#039;t take this option, it was my decision.<br /><br />I am sick to the back teeth of people calling me a liar for various reasons, shit happens, you&#039;re on a drug forum, and if you don&#039;t believe me you can go roll in shit and die.<br /><br />To those who are STILL waiting please message me if your order is more than 7 days old, with your address and what you ordered, and I will send you 2x what you ordered. I have such a massive backlog at the moment I would rather risk sending out too much stock just to get this cleared.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want any customers to feel let down.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to thank 99% of the users, including TheAbsurd, and those folks from IRC, who have stuck by me. Your support is much appreciated and have made a note of your names - for all those people who have been fucked around and not complained, and understood, their names are now on a list to get extra for ALL future purchases.<br /><br />As I am announcing this, no further names will be added - I&#039;m not stupid ;)<br /><br />Again, thanks for all the support.<br /><br />-Tunbear

				Thanks Tunbear. This was my first order but I ordered because a few people in this thread gave really good reviews of you. I knew there&#039;d be a delay because I read your vendor page before I ordered so no worries! The update on your page was more than enough.<br /><br />I was actually thinking on the drive home right now that Silk Road is not Wal-Mart (Tesco? I&#039;ve been to England hehe). Vendors are real people. Things will get better, trust me.<br /><br />Peace.

				I received my purchase from Tunbear in 4 business days. I was impressed by the packaging. The product, as previously denoted is not as grainy as other batches, but the potency is still top notch. This texture is also preferable for a snort. All around, very impressed with the transaction and will do business with again.

				^Thanks again!<br /><br />I tried 50mg last night over the span of 3 hours. I know it&#039;s a long time but I like to get a feel for things first. It was like being drunk and stoned at the same time. I had some weird thoughts but I can&#039;t tell if it was the mxe or if I decided to be weird because I was on something. On the third hour I smoked weed cause I figured it wasn&#039;t going to get any stronger. I just laid down in the dark and it felt like I was sinking. I had a few &quot;third person&quot; moments as well. Eventually I started to eat in absolute darkness for no reason. I experienced a lot of empathy. My computer screen felt like it was really far away. <br /><br />Really interesting effects. I&#039;m gonna try more next time. I might even possibly mix it with 2C-C since l1llykins had a great experience with that.

				Let&#039;s just say I eyeballed some MXE tonight and I am fucking manic. The mania is why I ordered this mxe. It&#039;s actually very healthy, realistic introspective mania. I use drugs as tools and this is excellent. I don&#039;t think I will do it again for a while cause I got what I wanted.<br /><br />As I type this the screen is getting farther and farther away.

				yeah thats a wise decision, i tried about 120mg once and people&#039;s conversation sounded like a bunch of incoherant grunts and the mind fuck was extreme, the one thing that annoys me MXE is how often people think it&#039;s Ketamine and decide to do a whole tonne chasing the K hole. I met a guy who hated mxe because his only experience was this time he did half a gram. What. the. fuck!!<br /><br />I guess overstated yeah - i didnt mean to be a drug snob there. But the level of subjective truth it makes you feel like youve encompassed i found to be pretty up there beyond psychedelics in my experience. <br />But it is rather addictive..

				I&#039;m trying to imply that the oral ROA is what caused the nausea. What do you mean by headache? It&#039;s an effect of the drug to feel like your head is full of cotton or something fluffy at least in my experience. There is a hangover after large doses but it goes away the next day. It&#039;s a great drug and I think you should give it another shot is all I&#039;m saying. It&#039;s in my top 5 favorite drugs.

It sucks orally. I&#039;ve gone through 15+ grams of MXE you can trust me. Snort 50mg and wait for it to come on then snort another 30mg. Do you know how to snort drugs or are you trying to be scarface and snorting too hard to where it&#039;s just going down your throat?

You dosed all wrong.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, it may not have been the perfect ROA but I did feel the dissociative effects similar like ketamine.&nbsp; MXE made me very introspective but I&nbsp; was battling the nausea and headache, it just wasn&#039;t worth it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not bashing on MXE, since everyone reacts to drugs differently.&nbsp; Perhaps, it was Prozac or just my physiology that gave me that massive headache.<br /><br />On good side, MXE is pretty cheap so I didn&#039;t waste too much money on this.&nbsp; But, I don&#039;t think I will try it again.&nbsp; God, it&#039;s been 24 hours and I still have the lingering headache.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MXE isn&#039;t known to interact with serotonin receptors. It is a full NMDA antagonist and a moderate DRI and and is thought to have a weak u-opinoid affinity as well (I think I felt some opioid effects when I took it intravenously), making it pretty much work on all the good parts of your brain that Prozac oughtn&#039;t touch. If I were you, I would start taking magnesium citrate, about 500mg, with every meal. Everyone needs magnesium much more badly than most people realize and if I recall correctly some headaches are caused by a magnesium deficiency, and some drugs can in lieu of a magnesium deficiency have funny effects on nerves.

I do however know that some of the most common deficiencies in humans are vitamin C, vitamin D, and magnesium. Eating well is great! But you should consider supplementing.<br /><br />Magnesium is particularly helpful for preventing muscle tremors and jaw tension, and I believe it also can help with other unpleasant side effects from stimulation. My hypothesis is that your headache may have come from some nerve reaction and that magnesium could help. At any rate, I do know that magnesium is an important nutrient and unless you are eating a diet high in magnesium you could probably benefit from taking it! Well, I would look into it before taking a strangers advice, but I hope you find what I said helpful :)

				So I decided to take the plunge and give dissociatives a try. I&#039;ve had plenty of experience with psychedelics and MDMA, but MXE ( from Awakened350) is going to be my first ever dissociative. I&#039;ve read up plenty on what to expect and safety but am curious what advice can you guys can give me as to what to do while on it and what sets it apart from other recreational substannces. I&#039;m 164 pounds and am planning to try no more than 15-20 mg orally for this first round.

				Poolsclosed,<br /><br />Took the plunge on Saturday night with Awakened&#039;s MXE, went over to a buddy&#039;s to chill for awhile. Wound up smoking a fair amount of weed and had him weigh out a dose for me. I dropped 15mg orally at 11 30 and by 11 45 I began to feel this very entrancing warmth and floating sensation come over me which I enjoyed a great deal. Shortly after that I began to feel like my mind and personality was vacating my body and I felt like I was in multiple spots in the room, which was also pretty nice. Shortly after that, things began to feel like a drunken acid-trip almost and I&#039;m pretty sure for a few minutes I was completely gone within some recent memories because when I came to I felt a wave of confusion as to where I was. That disseminated fairly quickly and that&#039;s when things turned a bit sour. I asked my buddy what time it was to get a better sense of how long I drifted away ( it honestly felt like I was gone for an hour) and he told me it was 12 15. However, I looked at my phone and it said 115. Daylights Savings time had kicked in and my phone hadn&#039;t made the switch yet. I dunno if you&#039;ve ever been tripping when DST kicks in but for me, it totally fucked me over. I was overcome with this massive sensation that things were collapsing around me. Things begun to spin a bit and I felt like I had been poisoned. I also felt like I was being pulled in a certain direction. I stood up and spent about 20 minutes trying to get a grasp on what was going on. I felt a bit panicked and my buddy did his best to calm me down, which would of been fine except for the part where he was weighing out some weed and promptly told me his scale was fucked up. So as of typing this right now, I still have no idea how large of a dose I took that night. We stepped outside and the cool air felt extremely refreshing. I remember my movements feeling very robotic and calculated. I felt like I was talking like a robot as well and I had a hard time enunciating certain words. We stepped back inside and I began to finally calm down and get a grasp on everything. I became very tired and relaxed and just chilled for an hour up until I felt the come-down. For the past 2 days I&#039;ve felt very relaxed and like a load has been lifted off my shoulders. Overall, I&#039;d give the experience a 6 out of 10. Next time, I&#039;m using a scale that is working properly and ensuring I take a lower dose. From so many trip reports, this chemical sounds like something right up my alley, but what I experienced was something different entirely. I&#039;d like to know what effects I should expect and feel that way I won&#039;t be caught off guard again.

				MXE is very stable. The first batch I had was laying around for a good 4-6 months before I started vending here without any loss of potency. With most chems the prefered method is airtight bag (vac sealed if possible), with some desecant packs to keep moisture out stored in a cool dry dark place. Amber vials are also great if you have them.

				Hey everyone, need a bit of input.<br /><br />I took some MXE last weekend. I start off with 30mg which is a reasonable dose for me. After an hour, the affects seemed muted so I took another 15mg. 30 minutes passes and I&#039;m starting to think the night might be a wash so I take 20mg figuring if it doesn&#039;t do anything I&#039;ll just go to bed (NOTE: I&#039;ve taken this much in the past without incidence). <br /><br />As the affects (FINALLY) started to set in, my heart started racing (normally it slows down). I wasn&#039;t sure if it was just&nbsp; my preception so I had someone else check and it was really high, around 180-200bpm. I took some xanax to prevent a panic attack and began to take deep breaths while lying in bed. I was feeling the dissociation while my heart raced away though I was relaxed, still, and feeling calm for the most part. I started to be concerned that I might be having chest pain and couldn&#039;t feel it because of the MXE so did some googling and eventually did some tricks to get my heart rate down (sitting up and bearing down as if taking a poop, etc.). I was able to get my heart rate down to the 80&#039;s which is still high but eventually fell asleep (likely due to the xanax). <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m wondering if this happened to anyone else and what might be the reason. I can&#039;t fathom anything I did differently that caused it. The doses were spaced father apart form the last time I took the same amount so while it was a bit much, I wouldn&#039;t put it in the OD category so much. <br /><br />The previous time I took MXE was over a week from the night mentioned at 20mg (for anyone wondering). <br /><br />Any thoughts/advice are appreciated and thanks in advance. I&#039;m planning to take about a month off after this and see if I even need it anymore (for depression/anxiety treatment). <br /><br />As for the conversation at hand, I can&#039;t say that Awakened&#039;s is &quot;better&quot; ... it is definitely stronger in a bodily sense but the affects between his and other vendors can&#039;t really compare. I rarely remember Awakened&#039;s m-holes so tend to use his when I literally want to disappear for a good while. My favorite is Reich (who is retired). And these days I&#039;m partial Tunbear as those holes often involve more flavor and are malleable enough to suit other needs, whether just having an adventurous evening or therapeutically analyzing something I&#039;m currently struggling with. <br /><br />EDIT: ok, looked around and it seems some people experienced tachycardia during overdoses (though theirs were in the 500mg range or IV&#039;d). Ah well, got to stick with my one-redose rule from now on ... learned my lesson!

				Yeah i love MXE as well. When i first started using it it was great. Tolerence didnt seem to be an issue for a while. I basically took it every night or every other night or so for like 2-3 months straight consuming about 4-5 grams during that time... towards the end of all this the dissasociative effects seemed to ware off and all i got was tachycardia and dizzyness.. like when i walked and stuff i was extremely disoriented and had crossed eyes etc but thats absolutely it.. no pleasurable effects or relaxation or dissasociation even on upwards of 200mg a night. I was new to drugs other than alcohol at this time and didnt know about tolerence since you never really get tolerance to alcohol so i stopped buying it after it had no/icky effects thinking it would never effect me the same way again. But now im sure this was just tolerence and its been like 2 months since then so ill probably pick it up again only being more careful with it.<br /><br />Also, If you dont mind doing it. Plugging MXE is the way to go. I just get a shot glass and an oral syringe, put some water in shot glass and my measured out dose of MXE and stur it in the water. Gotta stir for a bit it takes a while to disolve. Suck up the solution and squirt it up in you!

				Bit of advice to people - MXE is extremely potent, and, putting aside all these pissing contests that go on between everyone EXCEPT the vendors, mine, awakeneds, larghettos etc. MXE in all intent and purposes is the pure form of the chemical.<br /><br />The varying strengths come down to...well I have nfi why mine is varying in strength for some people, I thought it was degradation but I spoke to some people who said they had some for over a year and it&#039;s still as potent so I don&#039;t know what..but my point is, you&#039;re still ingesting the pure form of a very potent chemical, so please, when redosing, be careful!<br /><br />I also have to add an extremely unpleasant experience I&#039;ve had, that has occurred more than once. It seems stimulants (I say stimulants because that&#039;s my assumption, but my experience is with coke) MASSIVELY increase the effectiveness of MXE. I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW GOD DAMN MASSIVE THEY BOOST IT! On new year I was taking coke and speed etc. came home, when the coke ran out, about 6h later I took some MXE. I took a lower dose because I&#039;ve become aware of it being extra potent on coke..however I wasn&#039;t prepared for what happened. I took maybe 150mg, a dose which seems big but is actually small because my tolerance is so high now. The hole I went in can only be described as pant-shittingly terrifying. I lost all concepts of logic (time, space, senses, vision etc.) and was fully convinced that I had finally given myself that push into full on psychosis.<br /><br />The reasoning for this thinking is because I had gone into similar holes a few times before, and always after taking MXE following coke. Even a small amount, say 30mg, which wouldn&#039;t even register on a normal day, gives me the helicopters and makes whatever I&#039;m watching become my world.<br /><br />Long story short, do NOT fuck with MXE if you&#039;re on stimulants, it seems to boost it&#039;s effects to a level that even mental patients would baulk at.

				I&#039;d like to 2nd what tunbear said. As with all drugs treat mxe with respect but especially so since it is a research chemical and the effects of MXE seem to vary a lot. Like tunbear said I&#039;ve had customers report varrying levels of potency despite the same batch. It seems like MXE is very user and body chemistry dependent. I&#039;ve experienced very stimulating effects that were not very fun and very relaxing dissociative effects from the exact same batch with similar tolerance. The best conclusion I came to is make sure you are crushing up the crystals into a fine powder and give your body time to absorb it, it can really sneak up on you and the time it takes to hit can vary wildly.<br /><br />Be safe and have fun!

				Along the lines of what Tunbear and awakened are saying:&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I recieved tunbears gram before the new year. I started with a small dose, around 50mgs.&nbsp; Now, I had been using Awakened350&#039;s MXE and remembered reading on the forums that Tunbears was weaker or less potent or something.&nbsp; So I did more. and more. and more. In fact what kept happening was that the high caught me so quick that when I finally did get &#039;there&quot; that I kept forgetting that I had just done a bit and so ate or maybe snorted a bit more and more and more.&nbsp; At some point I prepped an IM shot and forgot that it was for IM and somehow IV&#039;d it... I may have done this more than once as I had dissolved most of the gram in water for volumetric dosing...<br />Anyway, this happened over and over... I think? I did the entire gram in that night; I went deeper into the M-hole then I ever thought was possible.&nbsp; And yes Tunbear, I was sure that I had pushed myself into a realm of incurable psychosis.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I thought that I was DEAD and the world crashing down around me was the last neural death rattle of my brain about to turn off forever - like as you die your brain stays in the last psychadelic moment for eternity as oxygen loss shuts down each of your cortexes.&nbsp; or something...<br /><br />I came to about 5 hours later and my room was trashed and my drugs were all gone so much for saving that for new years.&nbsp; Moral of the story is that Tunbears MXE &quot;(and MXE in general) is in fact STRONG AS SHIT and should not be taken lightly.<br /><br />Ok, time to go buy more.<br /><br />Topia

				Over the summer I accidentally took a gram at once. Not sure why, it seems like a retarded idea. I remember going in and out of consciousness for three days. Weird hallucinations, part of my vision would dissapear or turn into something .... hard to describe, like trans-dimensional. This may or may not have affected my anxiety disorder permanently. I think I&#039;ve recovered for the most part though, most of the time I feel pretty normal... exercise caution when redosing. consider not redosing actually...

				Hell yeah. It&#039;s pretty rewarding letting time pass in between each dose. Usually every time I pick up I go on a binge, but now I&#039;ve been really watching myself and it&#039;s fucking awesome. Plus, I sell my MXE supply locally and can&#039;t be fucked up all the time while selling.

				Hey guys, so locally I sell both weed and MXE, and the weed is easy to sell of course. Fortunately the MXE is a hit too. So, I was thinking of mixing weed and MXE and selling it for $25 a gram. How would I be able to mix 1g of weed with 100 mg of MXE? It&#039;s salt MXE so I would have to crush it up first.<br /><br />If there&#039;s no way to do it other than sprinkling it on nugs, then I prolly won&#039;t do it, cuz the MXE will prolly fall off the nug in the baggie...

				Review of pPharm&#039;s MXE:<br /><br />50mg insufflated produced a +/- effect. A second 50mg insufflated 15 minutes later moved experience into a +. 50mg sublingual 15 minutes later produced a ++, then again 50mg in an IM shot moved into a full hole, a +++. Took a while to come up on all accounts; long onset. Measurements were taken using a 0.001g scale, IM shot was done with distilled water.<br /><br />pPharm&#039;s MXE is on the energetic side, causing alertness and an increased heart beat, with less confusion and distortion. The color is on the sandy side but the consistency is granular like most MXE. Snorting does not cause a burning sensation.

				weed takes MXE to another level for real...<br /><br />Anyway the Erowid MXE reports I&#039;m reading are pretty crazy. Usually I wanna say that the dose they take is unrealistic but then they proceed to act semi-accordingly but generally pretty stupid. I think a lot of the MXE out there varies greatly in potency. or something. 100mg is about the point I&#039;m guessing I would no longer choose to move my body...

				I became interested in MXE after hearing about its anti-depressant effects. I suffer from it chronically and biologically, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever recover fully because my physical illness and the complications that are developing can&#039;t be cured. But it&#039;s nice to know theres some temporary relief. <br />- I played around with ketamine and noticed that I felt great, refreshed and one with the world once it wore off.<br /><br />Can someone give me a few tips? I&#039;m ordering from the UK so possibly tunbear or a EU vendor<br /><br />1) What is the consensus on the differing batches? <br />I&#039;m aware that it&#039;s due to differing D and L stereo-isomers between batches.<br />Is it best to stick to one, does it depend on what you want? or are multiple batches worth exploring?<br /><br />2) What about the addictive effects? I&#039;ve heard of people saying allsorts..<br />I know ketamine can trick you into thinking its a good drug. Is this more of the same?<br /><br />3) Since I&#039;m prone to anxiety when tripping, what would you suggest I start with, dosage-wise?<br />I can&#039;t understand or imagine how this chemical must feel, I can only compare it to ketamine. But it seems much deeper than that.<br />Can anyone explain the effects a little? Does it cause hallucinations, or just a retreat inside your mind. <br />I&#039;ve heard MXE makes even sitting still difficult, wtf? lol. really looking forward to this.<br /><br />Has anyone that&#039;s tried DXM and can compare their effects? how is the euphoria? or is it only when it wears off? (DXM is something i&#039;ve always been interested in, and i&#039;m talking to a wholesaler of it at the moment)<br /><br />One last thing, Any enjoyable drug combinations? I hear combining with certain things can be very dangerous. Theres a whole thread on it at bluelight<br /><br />On another note, the insoluble stuff could be freebase MXE, If you&#039;re able to save this up or dissolve all of your MXE and collect the insoluble part, this could be tessted.<br />Alternatively it could be either a psychoactive or non-psychoactive intermediate or relative, or something entirely different and possibly toxic.<br />Be careful.<br />And to the person who was going to mix it into edibles. I&#039;d avoid heat. maybe make a Cannabis caramel and stir in the MXE as it cools? anything with too much flour makes absorption slower. Candies would be cool. as would flavored geltabs<br /><br />Thanks

				1)<br />There are some batches that felt soft and magical, some just felt dirty. I&#039;m not sure the difference in the D and L stereo-isomers. The older stuff from EU was tits. for a while, Chinese product couldn&#039;t come close. The latest batches seem to be okay but not as soft as the EU I first started on.<br /><br />2)<br />I didn&#039;t know addiction until I started using MXE. It can get quite the stranglehold on your brain. It&#039;s easy to get into a daily habit because of the short duration and wanting to figure out what&#039;s happening. If you get past the few days and distract yourself you can break it... sorta... until you get that hankering.<br /><br />3)<br />It&#039;s lot of &quot;feels good man&quot; and &quot;lol what the fuck?&quot; too much to have anxiety I think. I still can&#039;t really describe it. I&#039;ve definitely had some crazy psychedelic effects far beyond the &quot;retreat inside your mind&quot; that Ketamine gives you but they are still both a little &quot;wtf?&quot; for me.<br /><br />Also, it makes me tired as fuck the next day.

				I also have really bad depression and anxiety and have used a lot of ketamine and MXE and neither really last. It&#039;s just when I&#039;m high on them that I feel &quot;okay&quot; mentally. I&#039;d go as far as saying there is no drug that is going to cure it as I&#039;ve used every drug worth noting.

There&#039;s no concrete evidence to show that MXE works on that receptor at any particularly noticeable level. The peaceful feeling is more likely from the fact that it&#039;s an NMDA receptor antagonist, because the same thing happens to users of ketamine and DXM. It&#039;s more of a personal reaction to dissociation and what you make of the experience. I would not treat MXE like an opioid or as a drug that acts like one... DXM is closer to being an opioid than MXE is, at least chemically.<br /><br />Sorry for the unsolicited 2 cents :)

				Colour isn&#039;t a good indicator of purity. If you cook this stuff into a fine powder it turns white, does it mean it purified anymore during the process? No.<br /><br />The main reason most drugs end up pure white is because of the conception that white = pure. A good example of when this normally isn&#039;t true is Tan MDMA which is often held in higher regard than white MDMA.<br /><br />That said you&#039;re welcome to wait until reviews come in and judge from them or get some or get it&nbsp; lab tested it yourself.<br /><br />Edit: Have just checked the pictures and it seems that my camera is making it seem more yellow than it in reality as this seems to be a problem with the meth I have too which in the pictures look yellow when they&#039;re really off white. I will look into fixing this as I assume it&#039;s something to do with the camera settings but if not I&#039;ll try and take some new pictures with another camera at some point.

As long as you are selling it as weed with mxe and making sure everyone knows &amp; isn&#039;t an idiot with dosing it I&#039;d say you&#039;re probably right that the best solution is to dissolve the mxe in water then soak the weed and dry it off.

				Hey everyone, got a sample of MXE from Reich with my order and it looks really good, a lot like the stuff from last year: white powder with off-white specks in it (not yellow like in the pic). <br /><br />I have to wait to give it a try since I had some other gear before the package arrived &gt;:(. But I&#039;ll let you know how it compares to last year&#039;s batch. Also, the stealth option is totally worth it!

				Just received my 100mg order of MXE from brainbank today. Had a little extra coin, so I decided to try this chemical. Packaging/shipping was decent. 5/5<br /><br /><br />This was my first time doing MXE. I&#039;ve never done ketamine, and I&#039;ve only done DXM a couple of times. I was going to do half and see where it got me, and do the other half. Instead, I said &quot;what the hell&quot; and popped the hole 100mg under my tongue. After about 30 minutes, I started to notice a small sedating effect and body high. After about 10 more minutes, I decided to go lay down for a bit. When I got up and moved around, I became quite dizzy and off balance. As I laid there, it really hit me hard. I started to notice some audio distortion. The cars that would pass by my house sounded really odd, like alien spaceships flying by or something. It started to become annoying, so I decided to go and interact with my family/friends. Bad idea. I stood up and wobbled my way to the living room. My body felt like complete jelly. I felt very dizzy and didn&#039;t really enjoy that much. Everything seemed to expand and retract. When I would sit down, the room seemed very huge, then when I would stand up, it would appear very small and crowded. I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland, growing and shrinking every time I would stand or sit, lol. Each time I said something, it sounded so slow and weird, so I just shut up. Then I started thinking some crazy shit. I felt as if I was dead. Like I had died years ago, and I was watching my life through the eyes of my former self. I felt like nothing was real. Everything and everyone was a hologram, mocking and teasing my dead soul through the eyes of my past self. I was dreaming about a life I once knew, through the eyes of a body I once had. I know it doesn&#039;t make much sense but this is where my thoughts were taking me. After a long while of thinking crazy thoughts I can&#039;t quite remember, I began to come down. A friend of mine informed me that I had been sitting there for some time.<br /><br />Overall it was a bit of an unpleasant experience for me. Not bad, but I really hate the drunk/dizzy feeling of it. Not a drug I would like to do very often. I&#039;m thinking I may have over done it, since it was my first time. Is ketamine any better? Is there a big difference?<br /><br />Thanks brainbank!

I can&#039;t comment on brainbank&#039;s gear, but it sounds like it&#039;s mediocre. You described something short of the m-hole there, and a first timer on 100mg would definitely hole... at least, in my not-so-educated opinion.<br /><br />Ketamine feels cleaner than MXE, and it has a more classic psychedelic feel. MXE has visuals closer to DXM, ketamine has visuals closer to the phens I&#039;ve tried, e.g. the 2c-x, except obviously in a different way... just like, the patterning is similar. Ketamine doesn&#039;t last as long, but sometimes that&#039;s what you want. Ketamine&#039;s less stimulating too. I like both drugs, and prefer ketamine slightly.

				I wrote this in brainbank&#039;s thread and thought it was worth repeating here:<br /><br />Honestly, I am quite surprised with junkiebug&#039;s review.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong guys, I don&#039;t doubt you at all but I had a very different experience with brainbank&#039;s MXE.&nbsp; I ordered 1g almost two months ago now after not having done it for a least 1.5-2 months previous to the order.&nbsp; I have an extensive background with MXE over the last 1.5 years and have ordered from most of the major clearnet vendors in the U.S. (Motion Research Co. before they closed shop, Wilk&#039;s Research, Chemical Store Guru, and some others as well as several vendors on SR [reich, Chem4coin, someguy9191, etc.]) so I feel I&#039;m a fantastic judge of product. Typically I only need a 30-50mg bump insufflated to get decent effects and this will last me at least 1.5-2 hrs before I need to do more, in fact the last order of MXE I got from someguy9191 was very potent and it took me around 8 days to go through a gram which averages out to 125mg a day and I was feeling strong effects the entire time.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Brainbank shipped the item really quickly, I ordered on a Sunday I believe and it traveled from Eastern U.S. to the Northwest U.S. in a matter of about 3 days with First Class mail which was obviously great.&nbsp; The packaging and stealth weren&#039;t very good (I could feel the product through the envelope :-\) but I understand they&#039;ve since improved this.&nbsp; That night I did 3 separate ~50mg bumps over about 2 hours after having drank about 80oz. of beer and felt only slight effects if any at all.&nbsp; Those who are familiar with MXE should know that alcohol can definitely compound the effects so I was very surprised at having felt hardly anything, especially after my couple month break from it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to give it a proper test the next day while completely sober so I could accurately gauge the effects of the MXE.&nbsp; After waking up around 10am the following morning, I proceeded to do ~50 bumps insufflated at 60 minute intervals for the first two and 30-45 minute intervals for the second two putting me at 200mg at around 1pm, followed by ~50mg under my tongue immediately after I did my fourth bump.&nbsp; It was only after doing ~250mg that I started feeling anything beyond threshold effects and as it was, I only felt mild effects after the fifth ~50mg dose.&nbsp; I did the rest aside from ~125-150mg that I saved for the next morning and never felt more than mild effects.&nbsp; The next day I finished the rest of it divided equally between a line insufflated and the rest under my tongue and still never felt more than threshold effects.&nbsp; I&#039;d guess that I divided the gram pretty evenly (~500mg/~500mg or close) between snorting and doing it sublingual so that I could really make sure to review it properly but I&#039;ve never finished a gram in less than 48 hours before!&nbsp; I messaged brainbank telling him this to give him an experienced view of his product.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t demand a refund or anything of the sort because I didn&#039;t want to deal with the hassle and I figured that if he was a customer service oriented vendor, he would offer to make it right (hell, seneca even resent me .5 BTHeroin when I didn&#039;t receive the first package and that was 3x the price) but I didn&#039;t count on getting any sort of recompense for the bunk MXE.&nbsp; To be fair, I don&#039;t believe that brainbank tried to screw me over or knowingly send me something that he knew was crap and that is why I didn&#039;t pursue a refund or a reship, I just chalked it up to a bad experience on SR and went from there. <br /><br />There is a possibility that brainbank&#039;s MXE has gotten a lot better than when I ordered it, that is the only way I can reconcile the glowing reviews in comparison to mine but then again it could merely be buyers who are not experienced with MXE at all and think his is a fantastic product.. I have no way of knowing.&nbsp; I just thought I&#039;d share my experience for those who were interested, my advice is to try out a few different vendors so that you have plenty of experience with MXE and so you can correctly gauge the effects in the future.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4685.msg830840#msg830840">Quote from: junkiebug on February 16, 2013, 06:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just received my 100mg order of MXE from brainbank today.

I can&#039;t imagine it even being enjoyable if it was a good quality product!&nbsp; For whatever reason (and contrary to other drugs), MXE seems to be especially active when taken sublingually as opposed to insufflated (although I prefer to snort it) so it doesn&#039;t surprise me that your trip was intense and you didn&#039;t enjoy it very much.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest starting off with around 30mg next time and go from there, here is a great website to check out dosing guidelines as well as tons of other info about MXE and any drug you can think of: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/methoxetamine/methoxetamine_dose.shtml .&nbsp; When you have no tolerance to dissociative drugs, you need very little to get started.. in fact, I believe I started slowly with around 10-15mg when I first tried MXE.&nbsp; It really doesn&#039;t give you the dizzy/drunk effect at lower doses in my experience, that is why I really enjoy it.&nbsp; I used to do a lot of ketamine that I&#039;d get in liquid vials directly from Mexico (I cooked it down to the crystalline powder myself) in my early 20&#039;s, while it&#039;s similar in dissociation you need 2-3x as much and the trip is much shorter (ingestion to peak to baseline in about 45 minutes) but it can be more intense.&nbsp; Since the trips can be quite intense, it can be nice that they have a relatively short duration but you can certainly prolong them by dosing more frequently.&nbsp; Hopefully I answered some of your questions, let me know if you have any more.

				My friends and I have had some time to try someguy&#039;s MXE. It definitely is the crystalline kind. I would say it is a little less potent than awakened&#039;s, but it is more clear-headed and less trippy. I tried 30mg orally just to give it a whirl and the effects lasted about 3-4 hours, as expected. I experienced mild euphoria, lowered inhibitions, and a relaxed feeling, with coordination lowered slightly. Others took much more and were coherent despite being very fucked up. It&#039;s good stuff and for the price I think it&#039;s the best on the road right now.

I can identify most vendor&#039;s MXE after a few tries, take one blindly and be able to identify where it came from. <br /><br />There are specific characteristics in some batches that aren&#039;t in others. One makes my body feel like lead while the other gives me a floating feeling. One will only let me think in abstract while I can be completely lucid with the other (in equally deep holes).

				Hi guys, <br /><br />The difference in batches isn&#039;t always down to purity. I think it&#039;s mostly due to different production methods and lack of proper analysis after production. When producing crystal meth if you get d-meth isomer you will get a batch of crystals, depending on how long you let the crystals dry you will either get very small shards or large ones, such a small difference makes a massive change in the appearance. I would imagine the different in effect is also down to different isomers for MXE, note this is speculation as unfortunately the UK decided to ban MXE before any real scientific research could be properly done on it. Different isomers would also likely lead to different appearances and slightly different effects, product which produces a bit of each effect could be explained as being a racemate mix. <br /><br />I would imagine most labs cannot distinguish the difference between the different isomers there are. After all NRG-1 (Naphyrone) a cathinone that was released after Mephadrone was banned in 2010 was lab tested, the vast majority of the samples did not even contain NRG-1 and those that did some also contained B-Naphyrone instead of the A-Naphyrone isomer that was intended. <br /><br />On the other hand purity will have a large impact, choice of production method and solvents used to remove by products will also largely affect the appearance of your product. I would avoid going towards the &quot;I like this product the most therefore it is the purest&quot; purely because us people are pretty shit at good judgement for these sort of things. If the MXE you first tried was the one you liked most and in fact was impure and some bizarre mix or something this would massively affect any future judgement. That said I don&#039;t have a problem with buying the MXE you like the most just saying that one is purer than the other by appearance &amp; effects. I would only lend this credence if you have previously bought another batch from a very reputable lab and that happened to have the same consistency AND effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;To me I really miss MXE being legal in the UK, it was born here and it should have stayed here. The best two batches both came from the same source and the first was a white fluffy powder and the latter was slightly more grainy but still a 100% fine powder. The first one gave me an amazingly odd stimulation effect that meant I was sleeping about an hour a night yet didn&#039;t feel tired at all the next day, it also had an empathetic afterglow for the 24hrs afterwards and amazing OEVs &amp; mindfuck when in a dark room. The latter did the same without as much stimulation but still the ability to stop you sleeping. The empathetic afterglow was less so but the OEV&#039;s etc were stronger. As I said we are awful at benchmarking effects and I believe the differences between these batches was likely due to me growing tolerance at an amazing rate.<br /><br />Anyway you guys have made me ramble on too much, I&#039;ve got to get back to work now&nbsp; :)

				^^^ good posts!<br /><br />I have past experience with coke and know from first hand experience how shitty it can become after it is cut.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dealers can transform 1kg of coke into 5kg cutting it with crap.&nbsp; &nbsp;The appearance is sometimes frightening.<br /><br />I wonder if MXE can be cut the same way without affecting its overall appearance and effects.<br />So far I have noticed some differences in appearance, and to some extents in effects too.&nbsp; But I have no major complaints so far.<br /><br />BTW, I read this term &quot;isomer&quot; so many times, but do not comprehend it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately I failed chemistry classes in high school...&nbsp; :D

				Isomers are basically the same chemical but mirror images. This can affect how effective they are. For example D isomer meth is the methamphetamine that makes you full of energy and stimulated. L isomer meth does not affect your central nervous system which is why people who use meth/produce it don&#039;t want it. That said L isomer meth is found in Vick decongestants as it still has a decongestant ability without the stimulating effects. <br /><br />Before anyone who knows corrects me, the above is a basic review of isomers there&#039;s a lot of different types if you go in depth but that&#039;s the gist of what they are.

				So I finally tripped pretty hard on MXE. It&#039;s a batch I got a while back from Tunbear. I laid down and it was like I melted and solidified into the bed. I was aware of my body but I felt dissolved and went on some kind of journey through my personal life and it was incredibly euphoric and spiritual. I wouldn&#039;t call it an m-hole just yet though, but I was getting close to transcendence.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how much I took, sorry.

				Shrooms + MXE is yummy! They synergized really well for a short while but my shroom dose was too high and ended up overpowering it into an odd trip. I think there&#039;s some potential there though. <br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll start with half a shroom dose 2 hours before a medium dose of MXE. That would be 2g of gandiloi with 20-30mg of mxe. Hopefully that ratio will extend my shroom hole. I&#039;ll let you know how that goes in a few weeks.

That said using two drugs at the same time is always more risky so we wouldn&#039;t advise other people do it.

On a related note we got some chinese tan stuff and cleaned it up, made it much better (Not the best we&#039;ve had but better than before cleaning). Shame the effective yield was about 30% so not really worth doing on bulk scale. <br /><br />Send us a PM on the forums (offer open to anyone who&#039;s posted in this thread) if you want to try a gram of it, only have to pay postage.

And yeah, ill health is not something i&#039;d abandon a vendor for. Product has also never let me down. I think someone else has stepped in, hopefully temporarily. I&#039;ll leave it there to be honest because I don&#039;t know whats going on. I don&#039;t want to speculate in case he does come back and sort everything out. If you see good feedback on Tunbear&#039;s page, its usually all true. So if anyone reads this post in a couple of weeks and everything looks hunky dory again then please do ignore. He is a solid vendor under normal circumstances.<br /><br />Anyway reich. Hope i&#039;m not too late - would be keen to take you up on the offer. Will PM you now. <br /><br />

				So as awakened was out of mxe recently, I decided to try out another vendor, brainbank. Although his shipping was quick, his product was so-so.<br /><br />I got it in, and weighed out some 30mg caps. Before heading out to my buddies place I snorted 10mg. I felt it a bit otw there but not much. After arriving at my friends I took a 30mg cap, and then opened and snorted another.&nbsp; Now usually this would have me pretty mexxed out off awakened&#039;s mxe but after chilling at my friends house for awhile we figured it was pretty weak. We all (my gf, my friend and his gf) took the same dosage as I just described (well they didn&#039;t snort the 10mg as they weren&#039;t there) and came to the same conclusion. We then each snorted another 30mg cap each and finally we started to feel the classic &#039;mxe&#039; feeling such as hearing the high pitch and walking all fucked. Anyway after testing it I left a 3/5 review stating that I was dissapointed in his product and then went on with my night. Now its 3:10am, I&#039;m still mexxed and I just got home to read this message from him:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hiya.<br />Could you change your 3 out of 5 feedback, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to hurt my stats because you think my product is weak. All of us here really enjoy it, and so does almost every person that orders from me. I never had MXE from the vendor you mentioned but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to score me badly comparing to the effects of his product. My service to you was to connect you with my product, which was not misadvertised, it is pure MXE we had made. It&#039;s not like we made some claim like &quot;BEST MXE ON SILKROAD&quot; in my listing.<br />I hope you understand,<br />-bb</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Really? It&#039;s not fair that my review hurts your stats because I think the product is weak? <br /><br /><br /><br />Should have just waited.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yep, i&#039;ve been squared by Tunbear too no with a double order. <br /><br />Stuff seems ever so slightly different. Just had a bump of tunbears old stuff (still got quite a bit of that left from a month back), and then one of the new stuff i received today. Slightly different feel on the nose, I must say. I wont be able to confirm properly until i&#039;ve used it for a few days though. It definitely seems like the same quality stuff though - the change could be something minor ie due to the stuff now being stored differently, or maybe he went onto a new kilo of product. Could even just me my body chemistry today - im pretty sensitive to any changes in it being a daily user.<br /><br />Anyway - All seems good. Cant seem to get in Tunbears vendor page though - has he taken it down? It just sends me straight to the message centre. <br /><br />

But on me personally it doesn&#039;t even effect my bladder and I don&#039;t get all those odd side effects you always hear about like ringing in the ears etc.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />It&#039;s my all time favorite drug&nbsp; 8) <br />And I have done A-Z believe me.<br /><br />BoNgOn

				I fucking love this shit! It could easily be my one and only drug. In small doses you just feel better overall and in high doses you can get way the fuck out there. I just love it. Who has the best now? The 1st time I tried it I got it from Awakened350 and that 2 grams lasted forever. I didn&#039;t even finish it actually. Had to give it away b/c I was dosing too much.&nbsp; :P

				mxe has earned a special place in my heart within me having it around for just a few weeks.<br /><br />its so useful in every dosage, and it has without a doubt changed my personality for the better since ive done it.<br /><br />im a lot more open and lively, i contribute to conversations much more, ive been much more quick-witted with my responses, etc.<br /><br />as far as who has the best, ive only had fiberoptics and the answer2everything&#039;s mxe.<br /><br />fibers was good and potent. it seems just as potent as ta2e&#039;s mxe to me, and since hes out of stock id probably end up going with fiber next time.<br /><br />Hope this helped!<br /><br />&nbsp;:P<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I may have stumbled upon why MXE users are noticing different effects when sampling MXE from different vendors. A result of something called polymorphism. Let me know what yall think.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Polymorphism or the existence of a compound in more than one crystalline structure, is a well-known phenomenon in chemistry and in pharmaceutical production. The Widipedia entry on Poloymorphism (in Materials Science) indicates that it is not unusual for a single compound to have two or three common polymorphic forms. In nature, polymorphism can be readily observed by comparing any two snowflakes. Although all snowflakes are composed of the same root molecule (H20) each snowflake has a crystalline structure that is unique as compared to every other snow-flake; snow flakes produced at a given temperature and pressure may be said to have some characteristics in common (take for example snow flakes produced when the temperature is in the teens or single digits (Farenheit) versus snow-flakes produced when the temperature is just slightly below freezing. Of course, while snowflakes produced under these two conditions will tend to have some characteristics in common (such as size) each snow flake neverthess has a crystalline structure that is unique from ever other snow flake produced under the same condition. <br /><br />[...]There are at least three (3) MXE polymorphs that have been produced since MXE was introduced in late 2011 to early 2012 by the members of the A.I.R.C.R. in the UK. It should be born in mind that, as used in this discussion, &#039;polymorphism&#039; may refer to<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (A) cases in which a molecule is presented in the form of a given crystalline salt (for example, a Hydrocloride (HCl) salt) where different different facilities or laboratories ultimately produce different polymorphs of the same salt and/or where the the same facility/laboratory produces different polymorphs of the same salt at different times; and<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (B) cases in which a molecule is presented in the form of an alternative salt (such as a Hydrobromide (HBr) salt) - in which case the same root molecule will take on a unique crystalline structure because different types of salts (HCl, HBr, etc) inevitably have different crystalline structures. <br /><br />When polymorphism occurs, although the root molecule is present, different polymorphs may vary considerably in terms of potency as a function of time (i.e how quickly effects are realized, the duration of effects, and duration of &#039;after-effects&#039;) and potency as a function of weight (i.e. the degree of effects realized for a given amount). Furthermore different polymorphs may also very in the precise effects they tend to produce - although similarity of effects also tends to be observed when comparing different polymorphs of the same compound. Differences in the potency and effects of various polymorphs may understood as deriving largely from differences in the solubility and bio-availability of different polymorphs. Small changes in solubility and/or bio-availability can produce marked differences in the way in which different polymorphs interact with the miraculous brain and body.<br /><br />One common example of alternative-salt polymorphism can be found in over-the-counter decongestants. Most decongestants that contain psuedo-ephedrine are presented in the form of a HCl salt. However, some psuedo-ephedrine decongestants are presented in the form of a HBr salt.<br /><br />A common example of same-salt polymorphism may be found in the difference between certain &#039;name-brand&#039; compounds (such as Xanax®) and their (supposedly) equivalent &#039;generic&#039; versions (such as generic Alprazolam). Relatively few individuals who have grown accustomed to Xanax® will fail to notice when a &#039;generic&#039; variety of Alrprazolam is substituted for Xanax® - even though Xanax® is nothing other than Alprazolam. It appears that, in the U.S.A. at least, it is frequently the case that a &#039;name-brand&#039; represents the &#039;protomorph&#039; of a given compound (e.g Wellbutrin®) while generic versions represent one or polymorphs of the same compound (e.g. Buproprion).&nbsp; This helps explain why many patients who have grown accustomed to a &#039;name-brand&#039; product&nbsp; do not adapt well to a &#039;generic&#039; version of the same product.<br /><br />It seems worth noting that is an amazingly well-kept secret of the pharmaceutical industry that the precise mechanisms governing the phenomenon of polymorphism are not fully understood and that the appearance (and disappearance) of different polymorphic forms may elude the ability of a given laboratory to control and reproduce them. Persons interested in finding out more about polymorphism may find that Bill Bryson&#039;s discussion of polymorphism in - A Short History of Nearly Everything - offers an instructive, and accessible to the lay-person, introduction into the bizarre nature of polymorphism.<br /><br />POLYMORPHISM AND METHOXETAMINE:<br /><br />Given that Methoxetamine has been produced, presumably in Megagram (1,000 Kilogram units) quantities, by different facilities around the world over the past two years it does not seem surprising that several polymorphs of Methoxetamine would have been achieved by various production facilities during this time. What is somewhat striking is that, as far as can be ascertained, Church of Neuroscience L3C aka K&amp;B Organics™&nbsp; is the only entity who has offered MXE for nearly two consecutive years who has made an effort to identify and distinguish different polymorphs of MXE offered in the interests of promoting awareness of, and ncreasing understanding about, MXE polymorphism and the potential or actual impact of polymorpism with respect to the effects of MXE from different (or even the same) sources. It has become increasingly apparent that different polymorphs of Methoxetamine may produce certain effects so distinctive from one another that a person experienced with one polymorph of MXE may incorrectly conclude that a different polymorph of MXE is not even Methoxetamine but is some other compound (such as 4-Meo-PCP or N-Ethyl-Ketamine) that has been incorrectly or fraudulently traded as Methoxetamine). <br /><br />That polymorphs of the same molecule 3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE (that is, Methoxetamine) tend to produce different effects may be attributed to the fact that&nbsp; polymorphs often differ in their relative rates of solubility which can impact to their relative degree of &#039;bio-availability&#039; or the speed and ease with which a given substance may be absorbed and subsequently enter or pass through the various systems and substrates of the human body; the rate at which different polymorphs of the same molecule are metabolized by the liver may also presumably differ. Differences in solubility, absorption, and metabolism may all contribute to the variations in the effects of the polymorphs of Methoxetamine<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Have only tried MXE once, but it was from Brainbank. I don&#039;t know how good the quality is, but must&#039;ve not been that great. He told me had complaints about quality but it was cheap so I went for it.<br /><br />Started with a 25mg line, felt pretty intoxicated, almost drunk. Not sure if I was enjoying myself while sitting in my basement on this amount. I felt almost like an uncomfortable drunk feeling. I decided to rail another 25mg in spit of this. After the next 25mg (probably about an hour or so after) I was feeling fucking GREAT. Had some dissociation and felt like wind was blowing really lightly all over my body and it felt amazing. Later that night I went over to a friends house with my scale, and we started weighing out 50mg lines. Each of us would take once, then we&#039;d leave to go walk around downtown throughout the middle of the night. Felt like I was a robot walking for hours while smoking like a fucking chimney.<br /><br />It was very enjoyable. I plan on buying more MXE from FiberOptic, and I want to try Ketamine and I think I&#039;m going to buy one of Supersun&#039;s PCP dipped cigs to split with some friends.

				MXE was really confusing the first few times.<br />Now it&#039;s starting to show it&#039;s psychedelic side.<br />The visuals are pretty intense, almost like 100-150ug&#039;s of acid with less morphing and the same amount of breathing.<br />Plus patterns are definitely altered, especially wood grain and items with strange patterns.<br /><br />Here is my I would say technically bad trip that ended up pretty fun and exciting.<br />Especially since I cleaned out my entire house because of it.<br /><br />&quot;Seriously, just ask - but please Hallucinating Horse - we need to come to some kind of compromise. <br />You&#039;re really stressing me out man.&nbsp; I actually was tripping out on MXE and thought the cops were coming to raid my house. <br />I only have personal amounts here, but it&#039;s more than enough for LE to nail me with distribution.<br />Anyways during the peak of my MXE trip I gathered up everything including my scales and buried them in the woods.<br />I was tripping balls, and it was pitch black and all I had was a huge mason jar of drugs and a flashlight.<br />Quite the psychedelics journey, but MXE gives me such strong focus and drive.&nbsp; <br />I can accomplish anything on it.<br />It may be the best drug in the world.&nbsp; Minus LSD, Weed, Kratom...<br /><br />Those things really need to stop happening LOL!&quot;<br /><br />Vanquish

What is the likelihood that it is any more dangerous than Ketamine?<br /><br />Ever since that episode of House I&#039;m a bit freaked out by the idea of trying an RC, But fuck this stuff sounds intriguing, and I love Ketamine so it sounds like a pretty good fit.

				Not sure on that shelf life question.<br /><br />I have another question regarding poppermachine&#039;s MXE. The last batch I got was not MXE I am very sure. There are reports of some other products getting mixed up and even him admitting to not knowing exactly what was up/ Any clue? Cause I finalized thinking it would be fine but no. Seriously no. I&#039;m almost wondering if it has any properties at all. I was completely sober both times trying it again and nothing. At all. Unless you count a sinus cavity that felt swollen and a headache.

				MXE is a stupid grungy compound that I happen to keep in my sock drawer because it kills time very well.<br /><br />It is a great substitute for liquor, which is barely a statement worth making.<br /><br />It is a good way to kill time. It is not a substitute for Ketamine. Ketamine is fucking awesome and amazing and the shit. MXE is a stupid compound I keep in my closet in case I get WAY TOO BORED one day.

MXE can approach it but for me the physical side effects take too long to wear off.<br />So take it in the morning and you better pray you dont have to go out of your house...<br /><br />And it&#039;s legal :p

				Yeah except I&#039;d want to take it from a fresh batch. And currently I am raising&nbsp; funds for the new vendor on black sheep, which does not go well.<br /><br />So unfortunately I can not ship any free samples.
