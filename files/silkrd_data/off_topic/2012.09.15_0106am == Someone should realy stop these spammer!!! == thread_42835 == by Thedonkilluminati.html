				Got one tonight from HTEDHTREHTR. My first private message, thoroughly disappointed lol!<br /><br />Guess they&#039;re not going to stop until they&#039;re stopped? Has anybody actually fallen for this scam yet? They must be making business out of it, that&#039;s why they continue? It&#039;s fucking annoying and a half, and this is my first night here!<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that there&#039;s no way to block their PM&#039;s either? Just got another one from the tossers!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s sorted out soon for SR&#039;s sanity!&nbsp; :)

				Well, I&#039;ve been PMed by these Mt Gox Morons FOUR TIMES tonight now, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the usual, or if they&#039;re targeting me because I&#039;m new, but it&#039;s fucking insane, and it&#039;s doing my head in!<br /><br />Found the ban feature, but that only works for individual ID&#039;s, and they appear to be using a new ID every time! Ugh!<br /><br />Please SR admin, mods, whoever, find a way to remedy this soon! We&#039;re counting on you!&nbsp; :)

Must be a robot or something? This can&#039;t be humanly possible, unless your completely and utterly nuts and in urgent need of a straight jacket! <br /><br />Possibly someone with a vendetta against the forum? Who knows?<br /><br />Just not going to check my PM box for the time being, until it&#039;s sorted, that&#039;s probably the most sensible solution for now!&nbsp; :)

				I assume a profit-seeking troll is like any other. So long as you don&#039;t feed them, they&#039;ll get bored and leave eventually.
