				Hello. I&#039;m confused and have a problem that I don&#039;t understand. When I got off probation the other day, I smoked a bowl of chronic. It was obviously legit weed because spice never smells like real weed. I expected it to be way better than the spice I&#039;ve had to use as a substitute for two long, agonizing years. But it was only slightly more euphoric, I might not have even noticed the difference if not for the smell. Before I smoked spice, real weed felt a lot different to me than it does now. It feels similar to spice, but not exactly the same. Has anyone else ever had this problem because it concerns me.

				Sounds like you got some bad weed or some really good spice. I don&#039;t think weed and spice have cross tolerance among each other. I would guess that the weed wasn&#039;t as good as you expected. But there is the possibility that tolerance could grow. The active ingredient in spice acts on cannabinoid receptors. <br /><br />However, when I sold spice I only had the best. My spice was known in the whole industry as one of the best kinds. I smoked spice for about 6 months straight. After that 6 months I was in a position to get some Alaskan Thunder Fuck. I got high like it was my first time. Completely out of it couldn&#039;t even get off the couch. Every show was the best show I ever watched. <br /><br />If you are interested in good weed I would suggest:<br />TheUsualSuspect - Great Quarter/OZ price with good weed<br />mrouid M39 == This is priced like budget weed and its very good. <br />Anarcho47 - Amazing OZ price worst quarter price in the world, awsem service, cool guy<br />OSO - Sells GREAT liquid THC. Amazing quality professionally done<br /><br />I can personally say each one of these guys is a good choice for bud/liquid thc

				I haven&#039;t used spice (as in the weed alternative, not DMT) personally, but a few friends have been in a similar situation to you. The effects seem to be &quot;fairly&quot; similar with my friends reporting weed having a better euphoria and spice being much heavier, sleepier (even compared to indicas). However, after smoking only spice for awhile their tolerance for weed did drop like a rock.<br /><br />I think I understand what you are saying though. For me personally, I feel long term use of any substance will lead to a definite change in feeling towards it. After smoking weed for about a decade I remember looking back at how the high was over the years. The first few years were filled with adventure, joy, laughter, and all those happy flowery things. But after having smoked it for years --- counting periods with no/low tolerance --- I do notice the high being much different than it was when I was younger. Maybe I&#039;m just used to the high. Maybe I&#039;m just more centered with myself. Maybe something else. No way to know for sure, I suppose. I&#039;ve noticed similar experiences with other substances as well (cigarettes, alcohol, mdma, lsd). Though your experience is indeed different as it was spice and now weed. <br /><br />I still find a good few hits of some THC wax or gold dust will take me to that intense, giggly, perception changing high of the good ol&#039; days, so I&#039;d suggest giving that whirl and seeing how it affects you.

				ahhh yes, this is a very interesting topic actually ... and yes smoking the synthetic cannabiniods will totally wreck your tolerance with weed.&nbsp; i believe the problem is with how tight these synthetic cannabiniods are binding to the cb1 and cb2 receptors.&nbsp; some of these super potent cannabinoids bind at like 10-50 times higher rates than thc.&nbsp; <br /><br />therefore after you have repeatedly used them for a long period to get high you need cbds that are a full agonist and bind very strongly to the cb1 and cb2 receptors.&nbsp; and when you smoke weed it just wont cut it.<br /><br />the good news is its reversible, after a week or so you will start getting baked on weed again, and after 2-4 tolerance is pretty much gone.<br /><br />alot of people equate the potency to how tight the drug binds to your receptors but this is mistaken.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				also with the spice you really start running into alot of the unwanted side effects of weed.&nbsp; the paranoia, panic attacks, high blood pressure, tachychardia (i think is the medical term), etc... <br /><br />also i have read of several people on the internet that had a pyschotic break while on a spice overdose.&nbsp; where is THC is completely safe, some of these new RC Cannabinoids are not safe at all.&nbsp; and it sucks that the safest of the bunch and one that binds at rates near thc is jwh-18, but of course they make that illegal which makes people go and use much less safe and unknown chemicals.

My spice came directly from a company in California. I cant tell you how many people bought my spice, 100s, maybe 1000 or more. The whole time I was in business my customers constantly said that they didnt get the unwanted effects they often got with other spices. Like weed you might get paranoid or something but good spice will never cause the crazy stuff like strokes, death, and other serious problems. I often had customers say that my spice was better because they had severe effects with other spice and not with mine. Keep in mind that I was selling large amounts of spice for a good price, so my customers were consuming more spice with less bad side effects and never anything serious. I sold 7 gram minimum bags at $30(and still making double my money or more with each sale) while the other top spice companies sold as little as one gram for $20. I sold a gram of my stuff for $5 + shipping so people could try it. <br /><br />With that being said its clear that I speak from experience in the industry with a high quality product. While alot of people, especially doctors and anti-drug folks speak based on the most extreme cases and focus on unsafe brands and then judge the entire industry based on the worst and most dangerous brands they can find.<br /><br />I dont think spice is a better alternative than weed but until weed is legal many people will choose spice over weed.

There are dozens of different chemicals, right now the most common are am-2201, jwh-210, and jwh-081.

				Using synthetic cannabinoids will cause some kind of &#039;cross-tolerance&#039; since they do after all bind to some of the same proteins. It won&#039;t be as straight-forward as cannabis tolerance; certain aspects of the subjective experience will be attenuated or enhanced, which may explain why subsequently using cannabis may lead to an unusual experience.<br />I personally would not consume any synthetic cannabinoid product, that these substances mimic the subjective effects of cannabis does not mean they have anything near the safety profile (let alone the beneficial effects) of cannabis. They are not phytocannabinoid analogues; the relationship is not like that of Mescaline and 2CE, but more like that of fentanyl and morphine, where the molecule itself is very diferent despite the effects being described similarly. There may be &#039;safe&#039; synthetic cannabinoids, but you should not assume that most (or any) of them are.

				I&#039;ve tried a few blends and they all sucked compared to good old bud. And it&#039;s definitely way worse for you than weed could ever be. It&#039;s a full agonist as opposed to marijuana and it WILL do damage to your cannabinoid receptors when done in excess which is regularly done by many who assume it&#039;s just as safe as marijuana.
