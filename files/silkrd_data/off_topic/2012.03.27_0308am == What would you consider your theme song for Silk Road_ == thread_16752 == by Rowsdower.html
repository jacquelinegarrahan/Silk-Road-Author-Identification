				Is there a song you like to listen to while browsing SR or thinking about it... I&#039;m not a big hip hop guy but to me I always get a kick out of this one song now and then when thinking about the wonderful things I&#039;ve gotten from this service.&nbsp; So yeh I&#039;ve been feeling the lyrics of this song lately.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Please go ahead and post music from whatever genre you want, no judgements here please tastes are subjective you guys should all know that and respect it.&nbsp; I listen to bits and pieces of almost every genre imaginable and have a huge record collection, just good vibrations to all &amp; be kind and share.<br /><br />I want to hear some tunes and see what songs come up in mind for you guys when you think of this wonderland of a marketplace.&nbsp; Youtube/other video host links preferred if available, but not necessary you can just post the artist and song title or whatever, but try not to get so obscure it&#039;s like your friend&#039;s cousin&#039;s band&#039;s back up singer&#039;s solo project that is nowhere to be found on the internets.&nbsp; Try to keep critiques to yourself or at least be constructive, try to be positive music is all about bringing people together in my mind.&nbsp; 1 love.<br /><br />For me it&#039;s lately been this tune from years ago by Styles P, I find the song humorous but I enjoy it nonetheless :<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCt8m-QXxAQ

				Loving this thread so far guys, gives me lots of great tunes to listen to again while I&#039;m out smoking at my favorite nature spot.&nbsp; Peace and love to all and let&#039;s keep this going!&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish SR had a forum for Music, Movies &amp; TV discussion but that&#039;s a topic that&#039;s already been brought up on other threads, just saying.

				Here&#039;s another one that now when I listen to the lyrics make me think of this place &quot;We know something you don&#039;t know...&quot; heh, it&#039;s a great tune from years back by Dj Format feat.

				In fact I should have phrased this topic title differently, to suggest people to list multiple songs that they listen to while browsing this place or which make them think of this service somehow.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite songs of the 80&#039;s, She Sells Sanctuary by the Cult.&nbsp; Lately even this song makes me think of this place, maybe I&#039;m becoming obsessed with SR&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgPvRSAdK6o<br /><br />I love listening to that on just about every substance imaginable, it always puts me in a good mood or lightens up my trip

				Rick Ross - off the boat; the chorus is him chanting &#039;I get it straight off the boat&#039;, so digitally altering this to &#039;I GET IT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE POST&#039; would make a fitting theme tune!

				Haha I just realized the theme song from Hawaiian Heat, a very short-lived 80&#039;s buddy-cop tv show, actually could very easily be modified to be a retro-style TV/Radio commercial for SR LOL.<br /><br />Check it out, I had a laugh when I started associating this song with SR.&nbsp; The irony of the lyrics just kills me, I&#039;ll post them below the link they&#039;re that funny to me but then again I&#039;m pretty stoned :<br /><br />Hawaiian Heat Intro - Goodbye Blues<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-2qRWfi1Lg<br /><br />It&#039;s not a long theme song, here are the lyrics I had to transcribe them myself but felt it worthwhile as I got such a kick out of this :<br /><br />&quot;Out in the cold, going nowhere, tired of toeing the line, can&#039;t get ahead, settin&#039; my watch to somebody else&#039;s time.&nbsp; Some might call it a twist of fate, a lucky throw of the dice, all I know is we took a chance and landed in paradise!&nbsp; Good bye, good bye blues, got no use for you!&nbsp; Good bye, good bye blues, kicking off our shoes - takin&#039; them off and hanging them up, trying on something new, so hello sunny skies!&nbsp; Good bye blues!&nbsp; Good bye!&nbsp; Good bye blues!&nbsp; Good bye!&nbsp; Good bye blues!&nbsp; Good bye!&quot;<br /><br />It almost sounds like a commercial for SR.&nbsp; Imagine some scrub on the street standing in the rain waiting for a dealer, looking at his watch, when his friend sends him a message about SR and he goes home and takes a chance ordering, and lands in paradise here... compared to the street.&nbsp; And so on, so forth... lol

I vaguely remember either reading that or maybe hearing about it from a podcast. Well, I guess he could always do edibles, heh.<br /><br />If silkroad had an escort section you would hear in your mind , &quot;To all the girls I loved before......&quot;&nbsp; lol.

				Another good one I thought of is Kaputt by Destroyer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puu3IvKnSb4&amp;ob=av2e<br /><br />I love the background music because it kind of sounds like new age computer hacking to me. Plus the song mentions cocaine and going through the &quot;backrooms of the world,&quot; and if you listen to the lyrics, a lot of it sounds like an acid trip to me.
