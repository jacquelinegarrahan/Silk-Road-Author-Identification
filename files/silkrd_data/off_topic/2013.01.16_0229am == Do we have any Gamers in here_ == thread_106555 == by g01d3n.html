				@StonedStupor<br /><br />&quot;Gamertag&quot; T_T I only have a PS3, no Xbox :(<br /><br />@jnemonic YES! Battlefield 3 is a great game as well. Shooting people while parachuting is just soooo satisfying.<br /><br />@Deutsche Bank Agreed, I have spent countless hours running over pedestrians on the side walk. Also, I cant wait for GTA V either!

				You can&#039;t kill them IRL (prosecution etc.)? Then just waste them in-game.<br />I think Grand Theft Auto is the only game franchise that never disappointed me.<br />I still love playing the first one.<br /><br />In my opinion it&#039;s the best video game, because it doesn&#039;t only entertain someone, but it also reflects how fucked up the society is.<br />For instance GTA V, just watch the trailers and you&#039;ll immediately see the similarities between reality and virtuality (exploitation of labor, housing bust etc.).

				Love Civ, especially when high.<br /><br />I find I only really enjoy games that require a decent number of mental faculties (read: FPS) when I&#039;m sober or coming down from smoking.&nbsp; When I&#039;m up there, though, I like light, whimsical things, like Katamari.

				@Scout Yes! Yes! Yes! Borderlands 2. Amazing story, amazing humour, amazing game. ESPECIALLY when your High. I vaped a bowl one time, and over heard Handsome Jack talking about Butt Stallion, I laughed and laughed, then I forgot what I was laughing about. Then laughed some more XD<br /><br />@splendidcandle357 With over 350+ clocked in CiV (V), I can honestly say, that is my all time favorite RTS game.

				Heh, I don&#039;t remember too much about Saints Row III, but my favorite thing to do was to run around and melee people. One of the animations was slamming the persons face to the ground, and your character poses with a shit-eating-grin. Laughed my ass off the first time I saw that. XD

				Yupp!<br /><br />Battlefield 3... hell yeah. I remember when it first came out, I would go home booted outta my mind, shut off the lights and start it up on my PC, then fly jets in those huge ass maps and chill the fuck out. I was so amazed by it, I actually felt like I was in the game.<br /><br />GTA 4... hell yeah. When I first started getting into drugs/the game, I had like .3 of MXE left and used to bump tiny doses and get fucked up. It&#039;s so fun playing GTA 4 while dosed up on MXE. In fact... I&#039;m gunna rail another line of MXE right now and boot up GTA.<br /><br />WoW... hell yeah. I&#039;ve been playing that on and off for a couple years now, me and my buds play it all the time. We used to all get together, start up WoW, and pack bowls on bowls on bowls in bongs, bubblers, blunts, whatever you name it. We haven&#039;t done that in a while, but we still play together while high.<br /><br />Halo 4.... hell yeah. I&#039;ve been playing that since Christmas, fun as fuck! Especially playing it online with your friends.

MXE makes reading people a helllaaa lot easier for me, so I use that &quot;ability&quot; while playing Halo 4 and I&#039;m usually able to detect what my enemy is about to do faster than I would when I&#039;m sober.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been pretty good at vidya gaems, so I guess playing it on MXE is like using NZT 48 (from movie Limitless) in real life lmao. :P<br /><br />.....fuck, I was supposed to be playing GTA 4 an hour ago.

				I&#039;m sorry, I know this statement is going to offend some people, but...<br /><br />Fucking FarCry 3 SUCKED. Absolute horse-shit. There&#039;s absolutely no replayability for me at all after defeating all the missions, as the only &#039;enemies&#039; on the island(s) that are left are fucking animals. They ruined the ONLY part of the game that I enjoyed ( capturing the bases ) by making it impossible to replay them for fun or for complete stealth without starting a new game with none of your good ass guns or skills or anything. The story was bland and fucking stock, like something out of a &#039;Hostel&#039; except with more hispanic folks, completing the game with one of the endings just doesn&#039;t make goddamn sense, and it didn&#039;t prompt me to autosave before I made the FINAL DECISION OF THE GAME so I had to reload a save from several hours before I started the final mission.<br /><br />The final mission is also way too easy, way too long, and way too stupid.. nothing about this game makes sense, the main character goes from complete fucking pansy who doesn&#039;t even want to hold a gun much less almost single handedly murder almost every single person ranging from low-level standard thugs to FULLY TRAINED mercenaries in what I can only assume is the hard-crime equivalent of Blackwater in the beginning and literally after playing thirty or forty minutes everyone is talking about how there&#039;s this white dude rollin&#039; around the island choppin&#039; fuckers up with a machete. <br /><br />It&#039;s just not a good game. I don&#039;t care what anybody says. The only thing that was fun about it was putting it on the hardest difficulty ( which was still, pretty easy if you&#039;re careful and play stealth like I did ) and trying to take out the enemy&#039;s little assorted bases.<br /><br />As far as other things that I sorta liked, I enjoyed the fact that you get information on the drugs this strange, strange organization is importing/selling/making etc, etc. But they had to go and fuck that up too! Half of the descriptions are absolutely incorrect, but the only one that really stuck out with me was the one on &quot;Krokodil&quot; or desomorphine, because they took the time to research such an unheard-of chemical but then wrote in there that it had effects similar to methamphetamine! I facepalmed at that moment. If you don&#039;t know desofuckingMORPHINE is an opiate, you shouldn&#039;t write about it. It has a synthesis similar to methamphetamine but it is most definitely not &#039;similar in effects to methaphetamine&#039;. <br /><br />ughhh.<br /><br />Sorry for rambling, but I can&#039;t stand all the attention this game has got because it&#039;s fucking shit. I get more play-time out of my copy of Binding of Isaac which is a top-down twinstick shooter and that only cost me 8 bucks.

It&#039;s worth at least a playthrough, but I&#039;m REALLY thorough when I play games and play them through several times before I get tired of them in the slightest and that game I just couldn&#039;t do it. First playthrough was alright though. It just seemed really stock and like they were trying WAY too hard to give it a sort of goofy feel while still maintaining a little bit of a serious aspect to it which is the ABSOLUTE WORST FUCKING THING THEY COULD EVER DO. If I want serious gunplay with a story and minigames and shit, I&#039;ll buy a GTA game. If I want batshit insane, I&#039;ll play Saints Row... both of those are great games and have SO much more replayability than FC3. But I mean the story will engage you somewhat if you looked at the commercial and thought it could be captivating. It&#039;s just that I write a lot and edit a lot and so when something feels forced whether it be a sentence or a video game, it completely irks me and I can never become de-irked in regards to it. It just has too many inconsistencies to be a good game to me. At least the inconsistencies in Saints Row were intentional, y&#039;know? :P

				Ahh, Dead Island. It may have had some online problems that turned many people away at the beginning of its life span (at least on consoles), but that didn&#039;t stop me from having a blast. <br /><br />Also Skyrim... Another time sink of a game. One of my favorite moments is when I first started playing, I shot an arrow at a bandit...&quot;Who&#039;s there???&quot; *arrow sticking out the back of his head*<br /><br />&quot;Must be my imagination&quot;<br /><br />LOL!

				I love gaming. Battlefield 3 is fucking amazing on almost any drug (and without). That and dead island are all I&#039;ve been playing for a good 3 weeks.<br /><br />Probably my favorite series thus far is Assassin&#039;s Creed. Storyline is incredible.

				If anyone likes story I would reccomend metal gear solid start at mgs 1 on pc or psone classics from psn ( i know graphics aren&#039;t good but the story is top notch) then buy mgs hd collection from there go with metal gear solid 2 and metal gear solid&nbsp; 3 (available on ps3 and x360 also mgs 2 on pc) then mgs 4 on ps3. There will be third game peace walker on hd collection but I did not like it. This game should be played sober though.

Storyline is incredible.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I hear AC3 is pretty badass, being based in the early U.S. and all that.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to play it simply for that fact.&nbsp; I played AC Revelations for a few hours but honestly the whole game system got kinda boring to me&nbsp; :-\ it&#039;s probably just my personal game preferences though because I know people who absolutely love the AC series.&nbsp; I keep seeing you guys talk about Dead Island but I know nothing about it.&nbsp; It looks like I&#039;ll have to go rent it and check it out!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You really have to play AC from the first game in order to fully appreciate the entire series. I suggest you consider that before jumping right into the 3. <br /><br />As for dead island, do go pick it up.You&#039;ll have a blast.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#039;s looking like that&#039;ll be the next game I dive into!&nbsp; Thanks for the recommends and advice everyone.

				Also, if anyone has a PS3, it might be worth checking out the Infamous series.<br /><br />Anyone remember a long time ago a show called Static Shock; about a black kid who acted white, and his best white friend who acted black.<br />He was a super hero with electric abilities, and surfed through the air on a trashcan lid? (I&#039;m not making this up)<br /><br />Well, Infamous is a game where you have electrical ablilites, and can choose to use your abilities to be a good hero, or an Infamous bad guy.<br />Very fun, indeed.

Also there Mass effect series which I like even more than fallout you have your own spaceship, your crew you talk with them make big decisions it&#039;s awesome. Also dragon age very similar to mass effect&nbsp; just not sci fi. And there&#039;s one game ps3 exclusive heavy rain plays like a movie very awesome game. if you don&#039;t mind graphics you should play indigo prophecy aka fahrenheit before heavy rain since it&#039;s the same company and they make these unique games.

				If any of you have a PS3, I recommend playing the Uncharted trilogy, especially the multiplayer! It&#039;s amazing. It&#039;s like playing a movie lol

				Heavy Rain is legitimately the ONLY reason I would want to buy a PS3... Indigo Prophesy was one of my favorite games back in the day and I just love that narrative style in games. I&#039;m hoping that with good games coming out along that vein like The Walking Dead series and Heavy Rain and all that the CYOA sorta titles will make a resurgence.

				Can&#039;t wait for Grand Theft Auto V myself in all honesty. Favorite GTA was always Vice City, I just liked the 80&#039;s vibe, the cars, the clothes, the everything.

There&#039;s even theme about drugs you help this old man sell drugs to people since morphine, cocaine was legal and new back then, it&#039;s a humorous themw with these drugs. You can go to cinema and watch some clips about drugs: here&#039;s video you will laugh very hard it&#039;s funny http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkvZ_JI2Nb4 . This game is awesome too bad i already completed it like a year ago but it was better than gta 4 and gta 4 dlcs. Much better. laos there&#039;s this game la noire - a detective game open world by rockstar but not as good as RDr but still if you like detective&#039;s play it, there&#039;s a case about stolen morphine ampoules from a ship heading to japanese islands. the time is world war 2 or something. here&#039;s la noire morphine trailer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp40YmRICt4 . i don;t care about drugs just mentioned it here since it&#039;s drug forum all I care is that these games are must play for everyone.

				So any Mass effect fans here ? If someone starts playing it keep in mind that you can import savegame so your decisions will be kept. Game is pure epicness alot of epic moments, alot of &quot;chills&quot;. I still sometimes get chills from watching this trailer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjOEmHEd2XM . if you want epic journey and like sci-fi (even if you don&#039;t like this genre you will probably start liking it after mass effect) you can&#039;t pass this game. if you don&#039;t know much about space before playing this look up how huge space is how huge solar system is, and how many other systems is in milky way galaxy. and then you might realise how huge galaxy is and there more galaxies. So it&#039;s impossible that we are alone there&#039;s aliens somewhere too. Maybe even dinosaurs or something. i don;t think though that humanity will be travelling in space because what when we run out of natural resources ? I mean oil is still used everywhere it&#039;s gonna run out sooner or later.<br /><br />mass effect is like experience once in a lifetime you will remember it for the rest of your life. <br /><br />Also any god of war players ? God of war 3 pure epicness too. I played all god of wars on ps3 god of war collection witch includes gow 1 and gow 2,&nbsp; then gow 3, then gow origins collection. This is kills by kratos epicness at it&#039;s best: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59FkJairRUE .<br /><br />Killzone 2 and killzone 3 a good ps3 exclusive shooter too, x360 has gears of war completed all 3 but did not like them that much however alot of people love it. never played halo yet. X360 and pc now probably has Alan Wake - that&#039;s great game about writer very interesting you should look it up.<br /><br />it&#039;s nice to give good titles to people since I played alot i know what games are worth playing.<br /><br /><br />here&#039;s another one ( I love epic games) this is very very very epic, very rewarding, very addictive - it&#039;s PS3 exclusive demon&#039;s souls and it&#039;s succesor available on x360 ps3 and pc Dark souls. These games are considered very hard by some yet very rewarding. i used to play hardcore mmo&nbsp; lineage 2 alot so these games weren&#039;t that hard you just have to take your time. boss fight from demon&#039;s souls one of my fav. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Qr_375ffQ . Dark souls epic trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7U-a9pJtHQ . These games is so awesome youll get pleasure from killing monsters and even more bosses when i was baout to kill them i had chills on my face. You won&#039;t take for granted killing them though because you can&#039;t make mistake because if you do they can annihilate you very quickly and thats why it&#039;s so pleasurable. These games are not for everyone but still everyone should try them. Atmosphere is breathtaking too especially in demon&#039;s souls. I was playing demons souls like 15-16 hours a day. it&#039;s that addictive for me. Put in over 200 hours in couple of weeks looked like shit though. But got platinum trophy.

Way too many games these days are released only half finished needing constant patches and upgrades.<br /><br />Heres a clearnet link to vgreleases.com GTAV page - http://www.vgreleases.com/pc/releasedate-243263.aspx - it&#039;s the most accurate i know of. Although i have seen dates that have been confirmed by devs to be pushed back weeks, even months, it can be very difficult for them to give exact release dates (regards to what i said above about polishing)

				I found a neat little space shooter at the GamesCom 2012 in Cologne and I played the shit out of the beta at the developer&#039;s booth there. I talked with the developers about the game and I gave them feedback and they gave me an artwork poster of the game as a gift :D<br />The game is called Strike Suit Zero. It came out on Steam recently. I bought it and the game is really nice. Check out the trailer:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS50TK_Eqxk

				Indie games have definitely rekindled my love of gaming. Over the last 2 years there&#039;s been a flood of great ones. Limbo, Botanicula, Deponia, Braid, Frozen Synapse, And Yet it Movies, Bastion, Blocks that Matter, Machinarium, and a ton more I could list. GOG and Steam, Humble Bundles. I like the occasional AAA adventure or RPG title, but it&#039;s these highly creative and artistic little gems that really light my fire.

Well, League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. There are a few different maps and 2 game styles to choose from, but basically you log in, click &quot;Play&quot; and you can either invite your friends onto your team or wait to be put into a team of players whose skill levels are close to yours. Once your team &amp; your enemy team is put together, you begin Champion Selection. You then choose from your list of available Champions(There are always 10 Champions that you can play for free, 10 different Champions are free every week, but you can unlock more Champions by buying them with real money or using Influence Points which you earn by playing games.). You can play 3 vs 3 or 5 vs 5, but 5 vs 5 is the only one that really matters lol. On the 5 vs 5 map, there are 3 lanes where you have vision on your mini-map, and between the lanes is the Jungle, where neither team has vision(with the exception of allied champions, you can always see where your allies are) and several neutral monsters hang out who grant different enhancements when killed. In each lane are 3 Turrets(basically big, immobile objects that deal damage to enemies that come too close) that you have to defend. Each team has an equal amount of Turrets and Minions, your minions are just little guys that descend in small waves down each lane and toward the enemy team&#039;s base.You get experience from killing enemy minions(and some for just being near when minions are killed) and your level increases as your experience increases. It&#039;s a really fun strategy game, you earn gold per second, per minion kill &amp; per Champion kill so you can buy items to enhance your Champion&#039;s abilities and natural statistics. It&#039;s not technically a roleplaying game, but a good team is usually made up of:<br /><br />&nbsp;1 Bruiser -<br />A Champion, melee or ranged, who deals a good amount of physical damage, but is also fairly hard to kill<br /><br />&nbsp;1 Ability Powered&nbsp; Mage -<br />A ranged Champion who deals magic damage<br /><br />1 Attack Damage Carry -<br />A ranged Champion who deals massive amounts of physical damage but lacks in defenses and it usually easier to kill than your Bruiser. It&#039;s called a &quot;Carry&quot; because your team should be helping you get more kills, thus making you more powerful and allowing you to then &quot;carry&quot; your team to victory.<br /><br />1 Jungler -<br />A Champion who farms the neutral monsters from the Jungle and helps lanes when he can by ambushing enemy Champions.<br /><br />1 Support -<br />There are different ways to play Support, most people choose either a champion with the ability to heal/restore mana or a champion with alot of health/armor/magic resist who can effectively defend your AD Carry. Champions with the ability to stun enemies are sometimes picked for support as well. Your main job is to keep your AD Carry from dying and place Sight Wards around the map which grant an aura of vision for a short amount of time so you can see where your enemies are and plan your strategy accordingly.<br /><br />The goal is to attack and destroy the enemy team&#039;s turrets to get to their base, where the Nexus(just a large power source, deals no damage) is located. The team that destroys the enemy&#039;s Nexus wins the match.<br /><br /><br />What I PERSONALLY like about League of Legends.. I like the simplicity of the objective, not bashing games with detailed plots, quests, ect., but when I play games like that I want to keep playing and playing, while with League I can play a match, I know about how long it&#039;s going to last, then I&#039;m done lol.. I dunno, kind of dumb probably but you know. I also like the amount of strategy and skill required to play, it&#039;s like even though you&#039;ve got such a simple objective, you get better and better and you learn something new all the time. I&#039;m really not a hardcore gamer, or even a gamer at all compared to some of you guys LOL but many hours of my life have been spent playing League..

				I&#039;ve played HoN, Dota and have been playing Dota2, to be honest all MOBA communities are awful in my opinion. Though I am a pretty decent player so I actually do a bit of the raging as well, I dunno it&#039;s a very rage inducing game if your team sucks but I still love the shit out of it. I guess try not to take anything anyone says seriously because after the games over no one really cares and they are just mad at that specific time, I play LoL as my main MOBA btw.

				I&#039;m so fucking anxious for Mirror&#039;s Edge 2 to come out! I fucking LOVE the first game and have probably played through it about 50 times (for real, no kidding). And I nearly shit my pants when EA said that part two will be made using the Frostbite Engine, the game engine behind games like Battlefield 3 and Need For Speed: The Run.<br />I also absolutely love how everything in this game is white with red details, it&#039;s really simplistic and beautiful. And the story is awesome too with its dystopian setting and stuff.

The original Silent Hill is killer. I can&#039;t imagine it on LSD.<br /><br />Also, loving some mention of lesser-known/older games. I mean, Donkey Kong Country? Seriously? That soundtrack would be like a beautiful brain caress on the right substance.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my list:<br /><br />- Skyrim<br />- Saints Row 2 (The Third is fun but I prefer 2, partly for soundtrack)<br />- GTA Vice City (soundtrack and style choice)<br />- Civ V<br />- Katamari Damacy<br />- Fallout 3<br />- Frequency/Amplitude/Rockband<br />- Mass Effect 2 (my fave of the series)<br />- Super Mario 2 (if this wasn&#039;t drug inspired I&#039;ll eat my hat)<br />- Vampire: Bloodlines (but you gotta play as the Malkavian)<br />- Crackdown <br />- Homeworld/HW Cataclysm<br />- Freelancer<br />- Eve Online<br /><br />I am quite upset that Fl0w never made it to the XBox, cause I bet that would be a favourite while tripping.<br /><br />But if I can alter the course of the thread somewhat, as much as I like talking about games, I can do that anywhere. What substances do people recommend and for what kind of gaming experience? I haven&#039;t had much experience mixing the two and I want to!<br /><br />edit: adding Minecraft

				anyone ever play WoW? I was so into that shit back in middle school. I remember going to Gamestop and they were sold out like everywhere. Took me two weeks to get a boxed copy, and another two days to install and patch because I still had a 56k modem.<br /><br />Played through Vanilla and into BC, quit shortly before WotLK came out<br /><br />If you could tell Leeroy Jenkins was fake just by the strategy they were using you probably played about the same time as me.<br /><br />:D

				Ahhh 1.6 days! Shit I played since 1.5. Went pro at a young age, was in the Cal-M league then was supposed to go Cal-I with the team but that year the league made a new age restriction and I was forced to leave the team because of that. Damn though, Glory days! Now its terrible to even get into 1.6. All these Mexicans/foreign cheaters [No offense] . Not even gonna call it hacking since they are all script kiddies. CS:Go is okay...Better than source but they still have to make a lot of adjustments/tweeks in my perspective. Coming from 1.6, source/Go was extremely easy! <br /><br />As far as other games. I&#039;d stick to mmo&#039;s although its been extremely hard to find a decent MMO thats not pay to win or just not thought out properly...Mmos are not what they used to be. Everything still revolves around the same idea and the creativity is lacking extremely I&#039;ve noticed. Quite a disappointment.

				Alright, so Freelancer is indeed still awesome, but I have to say it has me jonesing for Eve Online (I wonder if the makers of EO used Freelancer for inspiration - looks like definite influence to me). There&#039;s an addiction I have to stay clear of.
