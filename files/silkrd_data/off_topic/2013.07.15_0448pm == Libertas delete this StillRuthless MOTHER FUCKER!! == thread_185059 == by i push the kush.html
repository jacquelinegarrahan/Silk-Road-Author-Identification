				I&#039;d have thought on a site such as this, and what it sells, the propensity to create havoc like we&#039;ve just seen is somewhat predictable.<br /><br />The first thing that you ensure is that you have admin/mod cover 24/7.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />terp

				also thought of that, but still no one could say he was there? <br /><br />* also its started before this vendor time.<br /><br />this is why this method is so good to cause paranoia here,&nbsp; cause even if we know its 99% bullshit, this 1% is still a major concern, them guys found a weak spot below the belt, probably fucking LE / Atlantis.<br /><br />scaring the buyers is a proven tactic, can be so usefull here.

				The only shocking thing...is how many forum members respond to this moron like he has something true to say. I can&#039;t believe how many forum members read this idiots post in this thread and in another thread..and act at first like he has something important to say or could be telling a &quot;truth&quot;. They say things like &quot;what did he too?&quot; &quot; Give us some proof&quot;<br /><br />This loser has nothing to say.<br /><br />Though no one yet has names this person in this thread...I WILL. It is DealerofDrugs aka Infinitesource.<br /><br />And the reason he uses my name is because I let this fucker have it right away when he was Infinitesource and told EVERYONE he is a liar and a scammer. <br /><br />The difference is I WAS CORRECT!!! And less then 24hr&#039;s after I announced he was a scamming vendor( and I was the first to point it out) his SR account was suspended. THIS IS A FACT.<br /><br />I actually never comment on these threads because A. I think this guy is so stupid that anyone that reads any of this would never believe it. B. My reputation on SR is the best. I have been a vendor almost a year and a half. All I have is 5/5 and stellar feedback. So when idiots lie like this about me...it does not hurt me..in fact it helps me...as people go to my SR account and all they see it perfect feedback. ;D <br /><br />So though I will not comment again on this...I will say that there are some really stupid people in these forums. <br /><br />Also let me state for the record...I have NEVER had another forum account. I would not waste my time. And I like to say shit from MY account..I do not need to make up a name to start talking shit. I back everything I say and I am not afraid to say anything from my forum account. ALL I CARE ABOUT IS MY SR ACCOUNT AND TAKING CARE OF MY CUSTOMERS.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He

Show me a smoker who will not become angry about such a stupidity that separates him from his high/medicine for which he has a liking/medical need!?<br /><br />3) People who know me saw my PI and will start talking around town - bad enough. SR is not exclusively used by wannabe hippies with nothing to lose.<br /><br />4) People who know me, saw my PI and now think about extortion or blackmailing, which can equally ruin my otherwise peaceful life.<br /><br />I will send a PM to one mod with an idea how at least it can be tried to limit the damage. <br /><br />Publicly I advise that ALL forum posts get checked by mods before being posted online. <br /><br />This is a necessity as yesterdays fuckup has shown. Nobody wants to go to jail just because some fucked up vendor goes crazier than he already is.<br /><br />Otherwise I am really pissed how amateurish this situation was handled when some cracked head has now endangered the existence of people who came here to buy their desired substances without the risks involved IRL.<br /><br />Excuse my foul language but SR staff has done nothing that could have mitigated the situation a little, LIKE FUCKIN&#039; TAKIN&#039; DOWN THE FORUM AFTER THE FIRST POST OF THIS MADMAN SHOWING UP.<br />Get sober and only light up again after you found a secure way that this cannot happen again<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m in full agreement with you connoisseur. Couldn&#039;t have laid it out better.
