				My current method is starting to take to long.<br />I need to go from BTC to Cash the fastest way, what are my options?<br />I considered selling all my BTC for MoneyPack, but I dont know how to cash out that much money in moneypaks a day. Do I need 20 cards to get a few thousand out?<br />ACH transfers would be best, reliable wire transfers aswell.<br /><br />Any ideas?

				Sorry I dont have much experience with your situation but I do have one idea, although I am pretty sure you would know about it already.<br /><br />You may consider selling your BTC to SumYunGai (listings under money), who is currently offering more than the bictcoins are worth (3.25 right now I think). I am pretty sure he could explain to you the best way to discretely cash out the money he trades you if you just message him. I know he is currently WAY behind fulfilling orders for bitcoin. So he is trying to obtain more bitcoins which is why his offer is so good. Generally he is extremely quick to reply and complete transactions.

				You could also check out get-bitcoin.com for selling bitcoins for USD.&nbsp; Their service charge is a mere 3% for sellers and turn around time is 24 hours guaranteed (they claim, and has always been from the buying side of their system) provided that you don&#039;t set absurd expectations that you won&#039;t sell bitcoins for anything less than something much higher than current market value.<br /><br />They&#039;re proven 100% legit and have yet to hear or see any scam cases.
