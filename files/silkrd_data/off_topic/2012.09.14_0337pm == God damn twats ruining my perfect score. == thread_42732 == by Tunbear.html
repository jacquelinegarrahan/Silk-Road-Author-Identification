				So a while ago a user gave me a 3/5 because the thing he bought wasn&#039;t as strong as a different drug he preferred.<br /><br />I contacted him and explained that the listing mentions its not a strong drug etc. so he orders some from China and says yeah you&#039;re right this is even worse, so he changes it to 5/5<br /><br />He orders 2 more and gives me 3/5 again because he says its not as strong! ARGH! Already got users messaging me saying they&#039;re gonna go with someone with a better rating, this is BULLSHIT.<br /><br />We really need a rating dispute option, because people are so picky about vendor scores...I&#039;ve got 115 transactions, and 114 are 5/5 yet I&#039;m gonna lost customers because of 1 bellend.

				Oh god that irritates the hell out of me just reading about it, I can&#039;t imagine the frustration you have. I was looking through feedback on one of my fav vendors page b/c I noticed their rating dropped a bit and they were the most ridiculous things to score someone low for, like &quot;took 5 days to arrive&quot; or something like that. <br /><br />There are many times I&#039;ve wished I had access to something awesome that I could become a vendor for, but honestly I don&#039;t think I&#039;m cut out to put up with that bs. You have some awesome patience and tolerance sir!

				I would imagine that is a difficult problem with selling anything other than pharmaceuticals, because no matter what the potency of the powder or whatever it is, someone somewhere will always say it&#039;s not strong enough.

				No matter how good a vendor you are, there will always be that disgruntled customer.<br /><br />You have 99 happy and loyal customers, but it takes only one miserable customer to make your day.<br /><br />Just be strong and count on us, we&#039;re with ya.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve worked in customer service and know how this can suck.

First of all, I was extremely descriptive in the listing, giving details from an external website then going into detail saying how it&#039;s hit and miss with me and it&#039;s just kind of an upper. Second, you say the drug isn&#039;t good enough because it&#039;s not as potent as A DIFFERENT DRUG ?<br /><br />Why would you rate me down when comparing a drug (an EXTREMELY cheap one at that!) to a different one ? Why, if you weren&#039;t satisfied, wouldn&#039;t you contact me instead of giving me a lower rating ?<br /><br />I followed every part to get a full rating, I was open and honest about a drug that has barely any information on the web, I priced it extremely cheap because, as I admitted, it&#039;s hit and miss for different people.<br /><br />Oh and the drug is the drug, that is how it is, it&#039;s 100% pure untouched.<br /><br />Sorry if I seem to be having a go but every complaint I&#039;ve had, I&#039;ve tried to fix but I really can&#039;t see a fix to yours because there was nothing to fix.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />HIS REPLY:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">well i apologize. hit &amp; miss individual experiences are just about as equally informative as recycled web descriptions. for months now, i&#039;ve read experience reports about naphyrone being extremely potent, to the potent of accidental OD warnings. the only reason i mentioned MDPV is because i&#039;m also going by the chemical structure &amp; family that naphyrone is in.. for months now i figured naph was a highly potent cathinone derivitive with a chemical structure similar to other cathinone derivatives in the pyrovalerone family like MDPV, A-PVP, etc that are active at ~10-50mg. after the first day i am now shoveling spoonfuls of your powder into my spoon &amp; barely feeling anything. sorry for the below average review but i was horribly mislead &amp; my expectations are back to square one about this drug i was so eager to try cause i thought it would be much better. i completely understand youre side of this business however, &amp; honestly, if i cant find another vendor, i would like to keep you open as a seller if thats ok with you. if i go change my feedback on the purchase, will you sell to me in the future if i&#039;d like your services again?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ME:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wish you would have contacted me first though. I read the same thing about Naphyrone ages ago, but I personally didn&#039;t rate it, nobody I knew did, that&#039;s why I included the personal reports at the bottom of the post. It is completely pure, it&#039;s not a strength issue.<br /><br />I can understand your disappointment better now though, it just seemed like you were pissed because it wasn&#039;t the same strength as other drugs haha.<br /><br />I don&#039;t wanna be a vendor who bullies customers into changing their rating - I was honestly contacting you to offer a refund because I thought it was about MXE! So please only change the rating because you believe on my side that I didn&#039;t falsely advertise or wane from any normal way to not get 5/5.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />HIS REPY:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hey man, the rating will be changed. just ordered 5g of naph from a chinese source, it&#039;s definitely legit, but it&#039;s even more dull than your batch was. yours had a much better rush &amp; high, as mild as it was. i now know that the problem was not on your end. if you&#039;d like to still hold up to the 2g offer obviously i wouldn&#039;t refuse, lol, but i would feel like an ass for taking it. honestly i will probably buy from you again simply because your product was better, but it won&#039;t be for a couple weeks probably. i&#039;m fine with buying from you at normal price since i was at fault for speaking to soon to your fault about a chemical i tried for the first time. either way sorry for the mixup, you deserve a perfect rating! cheers</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This was the last bit we talked. He then ordered 2 more grams, and gave me a shit review, saying it was weaker (it was the same stuff, the picture even shows that it&#039;s all pre-bagged) and thinks it was dummy powder. Hell I&#039;d refund him if he came to me first, and just not let him shop again.<br /><br />Wish there was something I could do as this is gonna cost me money, it&#039;s fucking bullshit.<br /><br />-Tunbear
