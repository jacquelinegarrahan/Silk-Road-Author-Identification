				Made a deposit today and wound up having a little more BTC than I needed, and considering everything worked out without a hitch and I&#039;m not particularly fiending for anything worth 1.5 BTC, so I&#039;ve turned it into a nice little holiday gift for anybody who needs it! <br /><br />So if you need some extra BTC to get that holiday gift you want from SR, put a message here and after a while I&#039;ll choose someone at random and give them the code! <br /><br />Happy holidays! :]

				Okay, I&#039;d really appreciate it if you could give me at least .34btc. I need it to finish a .90btc sample transaction. I waited about 24 hours after someone said they would, then they bailed. Posted in spare btc thread, nothing.<br /><br />It&#039;s no biggie if you can&#039;t, I&#039;ll just deposit an extra $10 when I get btc tonight.

				Also just out of my own curiosity as to what everybody is getting this holiday season, tell me what ya plan on getting with the little extra BTC :] I&#039;m looking forward to enjoying New Years with my 5-HO-MiPT, provided it comes in all nice and prompt like! Think it will make the ball-dropping very nice. Hahaha.<br /><br />Also, Moon Fried, I sadly can only give away the full 1.5 since it&#039;s a gift code and such :[ <br /><br />

				Random post, but here is what&#039;s considered worlds funniest joke..<br /><br />Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn&#039;t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his cellphone and calls the emergency services. He gasps: &quot;My friend is dead! What can I do?&quot; The operator says: &quot;Calm down, I can help. First, let&#039;s make sure he&#039;s dead.&quot;<br /><br />There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says: &quot;OK, now what?&quot;

				Meh.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth a try!<br /><br />I can&#039;t say for sure what I will choose when it comes down to window shopping.&nbsp; I can say, it will be one of two things.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first would be to buy some molly.&nbsp; So far, after discovering sr, I have been supplying my friends a substance they have not had safe access to in years. (or ever?)&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to give all the credit to some crazy drugs, but a lot of positive things have happened to those close around me when they were given a moment to chill the hell out and reflect.&nbsp; I hope I will keep seeing new discoveries, among them, in the future!<br /><br />The next is some dmt.&nbsp; My best friend and I have talked for years about atoning the right head space and giving this stuff a try.&nbsp; Both of us have different back worlds that follow us around, and we would like a chance to have this assist us to get a better view of....what&#039;s going on with that?&nbsp; It really scares the crap out of me, but it&#039;s something that I feel like should happen.&nbsp; (I can only compare it to cooking?&nbsp; Eventually you will get nicked with a knife.)&nbsp; I feel very lucky to know a person &quot;on my level&quot; that I can share this experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;I actually bought some 2 months back but the guy went MIA.&nbsp; I received my coin back but ended up using that for the above statement, because I fell short with my last deposit.&nbsp; Making people set for end of the world/new years was more important.<br /><br />(It will more likely be the 2nd choice)<br /><br />So anyway.&nbsp; That&#039;s my case for finding a good home for it.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be fine without it, but it make things easier for sure right now.<br /><br />Nice of you to offer!&nbsp; GL someone!&nbsp; Happy holidays!

				And what luck, the winner is BoxofShapes! I just did a basic d10 dice roller, and applied each person a number from 1 - 10 depending on their chronological post order. <br /><br />So now I will message Box the code, and he will redeem his BTC :] Hope everyone enjoyed playing, and even if you didn&#039;t win, I hope you have a wonderful holiday! And remember to always spread the cheer around if you can :D<br /><br />Thanks for being an awesome community. If all y&#039;all were pricks I would have kept my cash and bought some pissant thing I didn&#039;t need and would have regretted it. But I am happy to make any one of your days a little brighter :]
