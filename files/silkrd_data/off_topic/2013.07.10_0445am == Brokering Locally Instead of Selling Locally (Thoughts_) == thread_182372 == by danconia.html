				So I have been buying MDMA on SR and selling IRL in my local area for almost a year now.&nbsp; Since we can consistently buy good quality MDMA on here my customers have been buying larger and larger quantities as time goes on.&nbsp; This means higher profits for me but also means more caps to put together and higher risk to me as a seller.&nbsp; I have a few &quot;larger&quot; quantity buyers (calling them that because relative to SR they&#039;d be considered small-to-medium quantities, like 5g-28g of MDMA).<br /><br />There is a degree of trust between me and these clients and I am starting to coordinate deals as more of a &quot;broker&quot; between my trusted customers and SR.&nbsp; One of my very close friends, for instance,&nbsp; worked a deal out with me where he deposits a certain amount of $ into my bank account and gets 28g of MDMA at whatever address he requests.&nbsp; I am considering doing this with some more of my customers.&nbsp; Since the profit margin is typically 2-3x the cost of the MDMA I can be flexible with how they deposit the money (all up front vs. half up-front &amp; half upon-delivery vs. all upon delivery).<br /><br />I was wondering... has anyone else done this or considered doing this?&nbsp; If this first attempt works (very likely that it will) then I may start selling this way since I would no longer have to keep any of the MDMA in my possession (nor cap them since the buyer agrees to receive as sand).&nbsp; I am *very* interested to hear your guys&#039; thoughts on this...<br /><br />- Less MDMA at my place<br />- Buyer just texts me their address<br />- Will likely use sellers that have tracking<br />- Cash deposits to my bank account are anonymous for the buyer, I can also receive cash in-hand if they live near wherever I may reside.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Yeah I think a lot of people evolve into this.&nbsp; I mean I could be making 4x as much gramming stuff out to every needledick around town but security is key.&nbsp; For a while I was selling to a handful of people then literally one.&nbsp; Then he met someone who wants at a higher price so I now literally order to someone I dont even know/never met.&nbsp; Still making like 250% ROI.<br /><br />Yet another thing I don&#039;t think anyone thinks of is there is plenty investment opportunities in drugs if you have money just like anything else.&nbsp; Lots of people have connects but not enough money.&nbsp; Just be like a bank.

				Yes, this is a viable model.<br /><br />Receive orders via SR with a different delivery address from one person selling smaller quantities IRL.<br /><br />It&#039;s called drop-shipping.<br /><br />terp

				If you drop-ship SR, what do you do when someone (who you don&#039;t know well) complains that their order never arrived? Are you going to not believe them (even though it happens sometimes), try and resolve with the vendor (even though you&#039;re not sure), or just lose the BTC?

Are you going to not believe them (even though it happens sometimes), try and resolve with the vendor (even though you&#039;re not sure), or just lose the BTC?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is the biggest sticking point.&nbsp; The good thing is that, for example, the 28g MDMA that I bought cost me ~$700 and I had my friend pay me $1650 for it.&nbsp; He could literally tell me that 50% of the time it hasn&#039;t showed up and I would still be making a profit.&nbsp; Obviously I&#039;d have to be stupid to expect that sort of true failure rate but my point is that most likely I would take the following precautions:<br />a.) Start off clients with relatively small amounts (I&#039;m thinking 10-20g).&nbsp; As the rate of successful deliveries stays high (I&#039;m thinking 80%+) I can increase the quantity sent to them.<br />b.) If a decent vendor has an option for tracking, I will use tracking.<br />c.) As mentioned earlier I could even front the cost of the package which, if lost, probably wouldn&#039;t be worth that much compared to the overall $ I am making with multiple clients if I slowly build the business correctly.<br />d.) If a client&#039;s delivery rate is suspiciously low then I let them know I am considering halting business with them.&nbsp; The great thing about SR is that everyone is willing to bend over backwards to receive the consistent high-quality supply that we are able to receive (and give to others) from SR.&nbsp; Someone trying to defraud me would be throwing away the best supply / hook they could ever possibly come across.&nbsp; Try to screw me over twice for a quick $2000, for instance?&nbsp; Or keep a positive relationship with me and continue to make thousands of profits themselves each month their relationship with me remains in good standing.<br /><br />Plus we cannot underestimate the feeling that comes with an IRL dealer having the best consistent quality of MDMA in town.&nbsp; I know because I&#039;ve been selling locally for the last year.&nbsp; It gives you a good reputation in the party scene and, quite literally, makes a lot of hot girls want to fuck your brains out.&nbsp; The feeling of being in demand is alluring to anyone selling IRL with good quality MDMA.&nbsp; I will be partially giving away some of this feeling / reputation in order to remain safer and, in the long-run, make higher profits.&nbsp; Anyone who has sold good MDMA IRL will know what I&#039;m talking about...<br /><br />And if they flip out on me they don&#039;t have much information to rat me out on.&nbsp; Communications with them will occur on a pre-paid phone associated with no identity.&nbsp; The MDMA they have received will show a return address nowhere near where I live (most of my customers will not know my address anyway), and in fact may show postage from outside of the country.<br /><br />Edit: In fact, if anything, I have more leverage over my buyers than they have over me if they were ever to threaten talking to the police.&nbsp; I know their identities, their addresses, and that they are likely to have MDMA at their apartment at any given time (let&#039;s be honest it&#039;s difficult for someone to be selling and just plain stop unless it was planned out a long time ahead).&nbsp; The whole point for me is to have less MDMA around so worst case scenario (this is highly unlikely) the cops bust down my door and find what?&nbsp; 10 pills of MDMA?&nbsp; That&#039;s laughable and would probably just make them pissed at the guy who snitches.<br /><br />In general I&#039;m not too concerned with my legal risks as a broker.&nbsp; If done correctly risks are so low that you&#039;d have to be a fool to end up behind bars (again, as long as you never keep too much MDMA in your house).<br /><br />Edit #2: I also suppose if I ever am suspicious of someone reporting a false no-show delivery then I could switch for one deal to a tracked vendor and see if they have the stupidity to do it again.&nbsp; It may be a better strategy to not tell them when it&#039;s tracked so that I have evidence to shut them up before I drop them as a client.

				This method has worked quite well for me. <br /><br />You actually can make more money by doing less. <br /><br />I won&#039;t give too much info on how I run my operation.&nbsp; Just make sure you find a vendor with tracking, that will be your saving grace with people who say &quot;it never showed up.&quot;

				Definitely subbing. I have no idea if I have the network to do this right now, but I have a GOOD buddy that I&#039;ve known for like 20 years, was a teammate with for about 10 of those years, that likely has the network but not the skills to use SR. He wants me to teach him how to use it, but we sort of talked about setting up system where he pays me and he gives me an address. It&#039;s so hard to ask questions on here because of the nature of the stakes, I&#039;m used to being able to just point blank ask questions on forums haha. If I knew how to get the money completely anonymously, this is the way I would be doing it. <br /><br />The question I do have tho, is if someone is busted and they roll on you, what exactly are you in trouble for anyway? How can they have any proof you did anything, other than the money? You technically didn&#039;t sell anything, you provided a service, no? Obviously, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m vastly over simplifying it, but I feel like the risks are quite reduced.

However, people that cap the MDMA sell it for a markup on that $xxxx/oz price...plus like the OP pointed out, people will pay for our high quality SR connects. I agree tho, if you are going to do it, you pretty much HAVE to do international orders, there just isn&#039;t much meat left domestically...and the product might not be as high of quality as say LL&#039;s in CA.<br /><br /><br />I think the ideal thing to do would be to accept btc. You never see the person, you give them an address, they send coin, it clears, you tumble it, then place the order to the customers address.
