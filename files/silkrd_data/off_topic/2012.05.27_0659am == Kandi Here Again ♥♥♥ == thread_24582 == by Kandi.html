				Hey Everyone ....<br /><br />I know most people don&#039;t know me &amp; can care less what I have to say lol<br />BUT....in case anyone does care, I was away for awhile because I got sick &amp; was in hospital....not from drugs.<br />I was supposed to leave a review and didn&#039;t want anyone to think I forgot or anything.<br />I also received my order from VMM.... I don&#039;t know ifi mentioned b4 but he came thru....gave extra &amp; it was great quality.<br /><br />I also need to leave reviews for other vendors &amp; I will.<br />Now I need to find out where I can get crystal meth again since I been away so long. I don&#039;t know who&#039;s good now. <br />Anyway, that&#039;s all 4 now....I miss this place ♥♥♥<br /><br />Grrrr....I can&#039;t get on SR, :-(

				*totally irrelevant side note* <br />I once knew a girl named Kandi, even though we never met we did talk on the phone from time to time. Omg, sexy voice!!!&nbsp; :D But one day (actually twice) I said some stuff and she got mad. I thought it was because all black women trip like that, but I realized women are women. She called me something, and pretty much spotted out that I had depression issues, I forgot what she said. Damn. Well, now we don&#039;t talk...and I miss her&nbsp; :( I highly doubt you are the &#039;KANDI&#039; <br />but whatever.....have a good day:)

I know a few black women though &amp; they all have different personalities so I don&#039;t think it was her race that got angry. <br />I&#039;ve met lots of people online &amp; I&#039;m thankful for every one of them however, your probably right in guessing I&#039;m not your &quot;kandi&quot; but nice to meet u anyway ♥♥♥
