				I want to make a purchase on SR and cannot figure out how to get bitcoins!&nbsp; the buyers guide is no help and etc....&nbsp; can someone please tell me how to get bitcoins?&nbsp; I thought i could go to walmart and get a moneypak but it sounds like it&#039;ll almost cost me double that way.&nbsp; I have a credit card, debit check card etc... can&#039;t I just go purchase them and use them immediately?&nbsp; THis seems like too much of a hassle.&nbsp; Thanks for any replies..

				If it was easy it wouldn&#039;t be as safe as it is ;)<br /><br />There are lots of ways though. If you want to use the clearnet and don&#039;t mind going to the bank, read up on depositing at a local branch of bank of america to your mtgox account. don&#039;t connect to mtgox.com on tor or they will flag your account as money laundering.<br /><br />other easier ways are to go to a circle k gas station or something and get a moneypak. $5 for up to $500 and then you trade it to someone reputable like sugar momma and get bitcoins at current price + 10-15% comission on the whole deal. It is worth it for the speed and anonymity of the transaction.<br /><br />Welcome!

				First of all you can search on &quot;bitcoin&quot; and get lots of hits or look in the security forum - page 3 maybe? - and there&#039;s a thread there. If you&#039;re in the US start an account with mtgox or tradehill, then go to bitinstant.com where there are instructions on how to fund those bitcoin exchanges and others with cash or otherwise. You can set up an account at Dwolla and they will take money from your bank account, though it takes a few days to do so, then transfer it to where you want. For cash, you set up an order at bitinstant and then it opens a window for CashTrust, you pick a local bank and make a cash deposit, no ID needed. Once you have your bc, transfer them to SR, which can take a little time for it to show up. Do your own research though first, think it all through carefully, don&#039;t forget to account for the fees in most of these transactions and good luck.

				I went with get bitcoins ((no relation) kind of like uncle ruckus.))<br />and all you have to do is -do a deposit at a bank of America or chase bank, no id or name required.<br />-send a scrubbed scan of the receipt as they instruct <br />-wait &lt;24hrs for btc in your specified account.<br />-success!

				If you&#039;re a bit tech savvy and have some nice video cards, you can mine them yourself but this takes time. Otherwise, you can get a dwolla account and an account at an exchange such at mtgox.

				Keep in mind that if you use moneypack and buy direct from BTCBuddy or Sugarmomma that you have no safety net.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not saying that either are not trustworthy.&nbsp; They do appear to be credible and responsible.&nbsp; You just don&#039;t have any SR backing if you purchase them this way.&nbsp;

				The easiest way I have found it to use get-bitcoin.com<br />You can just deposit money into their Bank of America account, take a picture of the receipt, and then wait at the most 24 hours to receive your bitcoins. <br />The drawback to this is that you will not have that much control over the BTC and $ exchange rate, as you would if you used an instant type system like campbx.com

				If you want to pay as little extra as possible, transfer money from a bank account to Dwolla (takes 3 business days), then Dwolla to an exchange like MtGox, then place a buy order, then withdraw the bitcoin. (Dwolla also has Dwolla Instant which costs $3/month and I think they loan you up to $500 instantly, but I think there&#039;s a waiting list for that.)<br /><br />If you want your bitcoin fast and want to pay $5 for a moneypak card and then pay 10% to 20% extra to someone who might never give you your bitcoin, use a BTC vendor on Silk Road.<br /><br />If you want your bitcoin within an hour and don&#039;t want to pay more than 5% extra, try bitinstant.com.<br /><br />You might also want to read this:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins

A few hours later, you&#039;re funded and able to buy bc&#039;s! That simple.
