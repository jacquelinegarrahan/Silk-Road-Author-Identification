				OK &quot;One Week A Month&quot; let me take the time and mercy to explain a few things to you.<br /><br />1. You remember that first or second thread you made this afternoon that not only did I edit out certain information but I also locked the thread in products offered? Well you dont have a vendor&#039;s account so you cant post anything in that section of the forum. To be clear you also were not judging the demand for your pharmies.<br />So your first clue to slow your roll was the locked thread. You did the opposite and spammed the entire site with out of escrow offers. Funny enough this is where you fucked up this thread and not only got it locked.<br /><br />2. OK this thread is utter fail from the first post and it was as ridiculous as the post i made above in this thread. Had SR Support or an Admin seen your thread there would not be a a chance in hell you ever got a vendor account on Silk Road. The reason for this is you violated quite possibly the most enforced Silk Road Guideline among them all...Out of Escrow transactions. I know you are excited to join the revolution but you are making serious mistakes on day 1.<br /><br />3. There is no reason that anyone will ever come up with that will change the fact that spamming the same topic even 1 extra time is needed in this community or spamming anything in the forums is allowed. What did you do...You spammed topics all over the forums with invitations to violate SR guidelines and PM you to do &quot;Out of Escrow&quot; transactions.<br /><br /><br />Now I want you to maybe read, not type through the forum for the rest of the night and catch yourself up on important things like Security, Packaging and all various protocols you seem to act unfamiliar with otherwise not only are you wasting your time but others time and safety as well.<br /><br />Now you and maybe other community members may think I&#039;m being a complete dick to you but I advise you to not look at this as a negative experience but a chance to restart and do everything correctly because so far you are not even gonna be able to be a vendor for even &quot;One Week A Month&quot;.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad
