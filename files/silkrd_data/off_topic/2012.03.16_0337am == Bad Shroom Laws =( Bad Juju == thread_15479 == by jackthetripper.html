				I was looking at the laws for WI before I started my shroom operation, and they are really bad.&nbsp; For manufacture of 1/2 lb or more, it is a class E felony, up to 15 years in prison.&nbsp; And then I have a prior felony and prison so it could be another 6 on top of that.&nbsp; This is not good.&nbsp; I might as well go back to bank robberies. ;p&nbsp; No seriously.&nbsp; What would they do here?&nbsp; How much time would be likely?&nbsp; I would like to think (and would think, if for peace of mind if nothing else) that I would get probation.&nbsp; My dumbass friend that did a lot of time with me, got caught with possession with intent on pot and carrying a concealed weapon and made bail, and I don&#039;t think ever served time on that.&nbsp; The penalty is balanced by the stealth and ease at which a person can manufacture, so I can see why the laws are bad as a deterrent.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing it anyway, but just wonder what my government has for me if I get caught.&nbsp; And if any doubts just see the quote below. ;)
