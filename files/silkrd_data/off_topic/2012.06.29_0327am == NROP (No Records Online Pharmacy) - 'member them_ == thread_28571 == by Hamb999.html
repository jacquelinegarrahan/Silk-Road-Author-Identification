				Anybody remember the NROP&#039;s back in the mid-2000?&nbsp; It was mostly norcos and phentermine I think - at least that&#039;s what we bought.&nbsp; You filled out an online questionnaire with basic medical questions.&nbsp; With phentermine, for example, we listed a high BMI and that we had been prescribed it before, etc.&nbsp; The site would say that a doctor would review and call you and you had to list a primary care doc, but they never checked any of these things which were fake, of course.&nbsp; They shipped from very shady Florida (mostly) pharmacies via fedex and DHL.&nbsp; It was pretty expensive.<br /><br />There were also sites (I seem to remember one called Friendly Clinic) that required verified medical records.&nbsp; Some sent a Nurse Practitioner to your house to do a physical exam.&nbsp; They were a lot cheaper (once you paid the up front fees for the physical) than NROP&#039;s and I think you could get stronger stuff or more of it.&nbsp; I never worked up the guts to try to fake medical records, but I was tempted.<br /><br />There was a review forum, much like this one, called drugbuyers.com, i think.&nbsp; I tried that URL and it says forums are closed.&nbsp; Likely the victim of the DEA crack down on online pharmacies and pill mills.<br /><br />Anywho, &#039;member them?
