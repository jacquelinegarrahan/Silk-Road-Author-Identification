				Question 1: The only thing I&#039;m pitching nowadays is birds of M1. My fastball is no longer wicked. It&#039;s a fucking shame and not one I would normally admit publicly. <br /><br />Question 2: My M1. I&#039;ll sell you some nice and cheap. My china boys do it up real nice like. <br />Also- I drink alligator urine regularly as I find the psychedelic effects to be unmatched but it&#039;s true triumph is in it&#039;s ability to gave a man an erection for 26 hours straight. <br /><br />Question 3 before anyone asks: Yes, my days are 26 hours. <br />

Where do I begin? I didn&#039;t &#039;attack&#039; DPR. LOL. I merely said some outlandish things and compared people who dickride DPR&#039;s every breath to members of the SS. I seriously fucking doubt whoever DPR is at the moment read my comments and felt &#039;attacked.&#039; <br />SR team has a lot more shit on their plate to worry about than some dude spreading obvious FUD in the forums for shits and giggles.<br /><br />Alas, my efforts to reach out and be BFF&#039;s with you are probably futile.<br />&nbsp;<br />The only thing we seem to agree on is the fact that you&#039;re a fairy.<br /><br />And if your last statement was tongue in cheek, kudos to you&nbsp; ;D

Ask me some decent questions. Like... &#039;how did your penis get so ginormous?&#039; .... &#039;how big is your exotic animal collection&#039;..... &#039;when was the last time you went 8 rounds with Floyd Mayweather&#039; ....

And I know you are just posting to get a reaction out of everyone and myself, and well done you have done that. I do not usually reply to your shit as it is not worth it because you will obviously try and justify yourself and call me every cunt under the sun to make me feel bad, but I am coming down hard and letting you know how it is is kind of making me feel better, I thank you for that. Anyway, I hope to never speak to you again. I hope you find something to do with yourself in real life and gain some approval from your peers and make some bonds with people that you can talk to to try and help with your issues; so that you can leave this site.

				Haberdasher, Jackofspades pretty much summed it up, but he missed out on all the sweet potential stylization points... <br /><br />like this...<br /><br />CA$H MONEY BABY!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />But yes, just a service that I thought the road needed market competition for. <br />(All Hail Dr. G0Nzo)<br />Jack N Hoff beat me to it originally, then BTC started downtrending.... in the meantime I just used this forum name to troll some of you softies into exposing how seriously you take yourselves. So I waited till BTC looked like it was on the end of it&#039;s dip and I bought myself the KennyPowders vendor account.<br /><br />I figured fuck it, only fellow vendors, CP enthusiasts... ahem, security experts (Shout to my boy KFMFKFMFKFMFKMFFKKKM, for real though) and broke, pseudo-intellectual, socially awkward fuckburgers (Shout to my boy Real_Drugs, I know you&#039;re reading this you fuckin&#039; twit) with buy stats totaling a whopping $300USD hang out in the forums! <br /><br />That shouldn&#039;t effect sales!<br /><br />And honestly, it hasn&#039;t. <br /><br />Because ain&#039;t none of you reading this want no goddamned bulk M1.<br />My hustlers out there know this because if you&#039;re breaking down dem&#039; birdz in real life and reselling locally... <br />you don&#039;t have the time/you don&#039;t give a fuck what is going on in these forums.<br /><br />On my other vendor accounts I play nice guy/customer service guru and all that shit and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, bob loblaw, blah, blah.<br />I conduct business properly, promptly and professionally ON all accounts though.<br />Kenny Powders is no exception.<br />He just likes to talk shit in the forums.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br /><br />So who/what is a Kenny Powders? <br /><br />Kenny Powders is the extension of the freedoms we were all innately born with, our god given rights if you will, to stand up next to a mountain and chop it down with the edge of our collective hands. <br />The same rights that allow individuals. such as ourselves, to proudly stand atop a building, stare down at the peons below and shout, &quot;SUCK MY FUCKING DICK INTERNET!&quot; The very same rights that allow you to purchase two blow jobs and a ham sandwich from an elderly women just because you can dream it. A gift bestowed upon all of humanity that is so painful to actually take a good look at, once you do it&#039;s impossible to turn away... you crane your neck just&nbsp; enough to continue getting a glimpse of the twisted, ugly, beauty that comes with the human experience we find ourselves in.<br /><br />That, motherfuckers, is what the fuck a Kenny Powders is.<br />I&#039;m out. Peace.<br />Throws mic down,<br />Kenny Powders<br /><br />

				And to be extra clear Haber.. it&#039;s not like M1 is the only thing I sell.. take a peek at my bulk custom listings offer.<br />M1 just happens to be the most frequently purchased dropshipped item on SR. <br /><br />And yes, Kenny Powders is solely a dropshipping account.<br />I am not domestically sending M1/Other chems anywhere. <br /><br />Unless you&#039;re in China or India!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Edit: I realize that there may or may not be some pill listings that are dropshipped more frequently than M1, I&#039;m not entirely sure. But whatever, my original comment stands.
