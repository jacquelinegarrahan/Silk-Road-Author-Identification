				Idiots in real life...yes...many of them exist. In fact...more for than not I would imagine.

				If you want to deal with retards all day open a vendor account. I absolutely cherish my good customers, and those who can provide good conversation.<br /><br />But if trying to read a PM you send me gives me a headache, or you can&#039;t format your own address you&#039;re retarded. How some people manage to get on TOR is surprising. <br /><br />Nobody reads my vendor page. I canceled an order from Poland today. <br /><br />Poland? <br /><br />&nbsp;???
