				I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced any permanent side effects from doing magic mushrooms.<br />I&#039;ve only done them twice but ever since I have I get these little black dots that float around in my peripheral vision.<br />Its not that noticeable in the summer but now that there&#039;s snow everywhere It looks like little flies or bits of ash floating around all over the place and its getting annoying.<br />It&#039;s been like 3 or 4 years since I last did shrooms and I think its actually gotten worse this year. As I&#039;m typing this there is a little black dot floating around my screen (Should I punch it?)<br /><br />I was thinking about trying shrooms again but I&#039;m hesitant about fucking up my head even more.

				Those are called floaters.&nbsp; Not the toilet kind.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Very common.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Google that shiz.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have them,&nbsp; you get used to them, and when you look at white walls or snow or even a nice blue sky.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pain in the ass, but you learn to not see them after a while.

				I presume floaters (lol) can happen after using any type of psychedelic, or just magic mushies?

A hit in the head could do it, or some other strong movement; MAYBE even emotional turmoil, like the kind that a strong psychedelic trip may produce. <br /><br />The fact that you didn&#039;t notice them before the trip may indicate that you didn&#039;t have them, or it may show that you just didn&#039;t notice them period. But there&#039;s no direct physical cause and effect between a trip shroom or otherwise and the sudden appearance of floaters.

I ask people if they think i would of been a shroom head, and they say off the bat- NO..but as they are more convinced...hahahha you know when their is psychedelic love in the air<br /><br />i&#039;m a modern day hippy for life. i lift heavy 5 days a week, keep very good hygeine, look good.<br />but nothing will ever change my psychedelic background =)
