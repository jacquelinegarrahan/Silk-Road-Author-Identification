				So, I took a bit of time off from SR. <br />I return, and all my top vendors are either rogue, gone, or empty. <br />Budderman- Ripped off, sick, and no listings, no replies......FUCK! His e-thc has changed my world. I must have MORE. Or a recipe! <br />TheUsualSuspect- rogue (?) Sick (?) Who knows............<br />Galindoi- Poof, gone! Made word of a return, but account was then deleted. <br />Tony76- Rogue<br />NextDayAir- Prices went through the roof<br />Dopeboy- Made a brief return, only to disappear again?<br />ChristyNugs- got back to me, workin on a deal, now. So fuckin glad, too, they are my go to for herb and hash, love em! <br /><br />WTF happened? Or is it just the vendors I had chose? Luckily, no one got one over on me! Love escrow. <br />But sad that some really good vendors went bad, or are no longer here. <br />OK, there&#039;s my off topic whining. Thanks for reading.

				Yeah there were a few scammers left over after the sale but I haven&#039;t had any issues recently.&nbsp; Then again I don&#039;t buy coins here and I NEVER finalize early...&nbsp; Keep an eye on the forums but most of the people left seem to be keeping up the good work.<br /><br />There are a few up and coming vendors I have purchased from recently and I think they will be able to fill the shoes of those who left.

				We did have a good group for a while. <br />I think Tony tried to scam me on my last order with him, as he asked me to FE, and I threw a shit fit, both privately, and on the forums.&nbsp; ::)<br />He replied right quick, and allowed my escrow. Had to have needed the money bad, cause apparently a week after that, he ripped everyone. Luckily, I had ordered enough molly, enough times, to earn his respect level of escrow. Even if I hadn&#039;t, there&#039;s no way I would have FE&#039;d on my last order, as it was large. $50 I don&#039;t mind losing.....once. <br />Budderman promises a return. I sure hope so, as the liquid allows me to be blazed while working, which is a blessing. <br />All the others I had only ordered from once or twice, anyway. <br />And Christy Nugs, well, you know how I feel bout y&#039;all. My local guy is furious over you, but oh well. If I ever stop ordering, it&#039;s because he finally dropped his price for me, AND you stop selling hash, lol. It&#039;s sooooo nice to have not just in the fall/winter. <br />I hope our relationship remains nothing but great vibes, and pure love. <br />On a side note: I meant to mention last time, but forgot: When I opened my last box, I was like &quot;they better use biodegradable peanuts!!!&quot; ....and they were.....you fucking RULE.
