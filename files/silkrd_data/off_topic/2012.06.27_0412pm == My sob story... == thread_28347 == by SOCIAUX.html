				This is actually kind of humiliating&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />So here I was, cruising through the MDMA listings, practically salivating looking at all of the choices. I&#039;ve spent that past 3 days trying to sort through methods of getting BTC into my SR wallet, all of them were a pain in the ass, but I managed to do it. I did all of the math (I thought so, at least) and got my Bitcoins. <br />This is where it gets brutal. I suppose fluctuating exchange rates, hidden fees, etc. are the cause of this, but I am 1 BTC short of being able to make my intended purchase :o<br />I have been looking forward to this MDMA for WEEKS. I was so disappointed :(<br /><br />I honestly can&#039;t believe that I would resort to begging. If there is a kind soul out there who could loan me 1 BTC, I would be forever grateful. I&#039;ll even pay you back 200% in the future. It just takes SO long to move Bitcoins around, I don&#039;t want to do it all again for 1 measly Coin. Believe me, I have no plans on leaving SR anytime soon, and I will pay you back as soon as I get another set of Bitcoins in.<br /><br />God Bless,<br />-SOCIAUX
