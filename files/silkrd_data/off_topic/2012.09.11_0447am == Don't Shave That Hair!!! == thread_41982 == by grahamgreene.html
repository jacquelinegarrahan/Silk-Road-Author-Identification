				Don&#039;t normally post stuff like this but I came across the following post on one of the other forums I frequent and figured some of you lot might get a kick out of it.&nbsp; :D<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t Shave That Hair!!!<br />I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble ****ting.<br /><br />No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can&#039;t-Be-Flushed threshold.<br /><br />I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. &quot;Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don&#039;t I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!&quot; I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. &quot;How many Indians could there be?&quot; said by General Custer. &quot;Looks like a good day for a drive!&quot; by JFK. &quot;There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!&quot; by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.<br /><br />I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.<br /><br />Little did I know.<br /><br />I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic ****- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky ****/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.<br /><br />Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering ****/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own **** blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: &quot;It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.&quot;<br /><br />Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.<br /><br />As if that wasn&#039;t enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn&#039;t just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.<br /><br />Friends, DON&#039;T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!

				You reminded me of this gem i found, read below!!<br /><br />Alright...I don&#039;t care if you guys believe me ... it&#039;s real. This is the the most embarassing thing that I&#039;ve ever experienced... it was a horrible night for me.. and I&#039;m sharing it with you guys because I don&#039;t want any of my misc brahs to have to go through this.. especially since it all could have been EASILY prevented. I have added MS paint images so that you have a better idea as to what happened. It&#039;s very long, but I&#039;ll do my best to recount all of the important details. no ****ing cliffs..... read it to save yourself from something like this...<br /><br />Anyway...<br />If you&#039;ve been following my social anxiety thread you would have learned that I got an asian girls number during my last update (the encounter wasn&#039;t recorded unfortunetely because my Camera froze). But anyway, it&#039;s been over a week and I was feeling like taking a break from exam studying, and I figured that if I didn&#039;t call her before exams were done then I wouldn&#039;t get a chance to see her until after the break (which would be too long perhaps). So I called her up and asked her if she wanted to take a break from studying and meet me for coffee. Well she said yes, and we met at a campus cafe. We had some small talk, and it went well overall. After that she said &quot;hey my roomate is making some chinese food for dinner because her boyfriend is over, would you like to come by and try some? she usually makes way more than needed&quot;. Now at that point I felt like I had to take a sh!t, but there was no way I could turn down this opportunity; it seemed like she was into me and this would be a great opportunity to get to know each other further. So I decided to try and hold my crap as long as possible (I don&#039;t crap in public toilets) and accept her invitation.<br /><br />Well we went back to her place, had some food (very good btw)... and ****... I had to take take a sh!t really badly... and I also had to take a piss really badly (I had been holding that too since I didn&#039;t bring my pee bottles with me to the date)... I really didn&#039;t want to use her washroom because I didn&#039;t want stink the place up... but it became so unbearable to the point where I could feel the turd popping out of my rectum.. to make matters worse I was actually starting to get an erection (I&#039;m not sure why.. but that&#039;s what happened). So I rushed to the washroom... and thus begins the worst possible scenario imagineable. <br /><br />I pull down my pants step up to the toilet and I am then faced with an ominous predicament; I have to extremely badly take BOTH a pee AND a POO.... AND I have an erection.... what the **** do I do? Which do I do first??<br /><br />So I bend over and try to push my erected penis down a bit to pee into the can... but as I relax my pelvic floor muscles to release the urine.. I feel my turd start to come out at the same time!<br /><br />So then I&#039;m like &quot;fuk this... I&#039;ll just try and hold the pee and let the poo come out&quot;... so I sit on the can... grasp my penis hard to try and &quot;block&quot; it... and I then tried to let the crap come out....that didn&#039;t work so well...<br /><br />As I relaxed my anal sphincters... my pelvic floor muscles relaxed as well and piss started flying all over the floor... I started panicking at this point... so I desperately held my crap again, while I attempted to shove/bend my erect penis into the toilet. Once it was in... I tried take the piss and crap at the same time, but my ass was too far out and this massive turd started flying out missing the bowl, landing partially on the back rim and partially on the floor.<br /><br />I then closed everything off again (you can&#039;t imagine the pain of repeatedly blocking yourself from peeing and pooing when you have go so badly)... wtf was I supposed to do? I either pee on her floor or poo on her floor....then out of sheer desperation and instinct an idea popped into my head:<br /><br />I ran into her bathtub and let myself go there... I figured that at least this way I could rinse it all down instead of getting sh!t on her floor....<br /><br />At that point things get even worse... <br /><br />The turd wouldn&#039;t ****ing dissolve... and the damn bish was asking me wtf I&#039;m doing showering in her washroom....<br /><br />I then answer &quot;yea lol... I&#039;m showering... is that ok?&quot;...<br /><br />she says: what the hell? why?? you don&#039;t think we&#039;re having sex do you???<br /><br />At this point I can&#039;t even think straight and I jokingly (retardedly) say: yes we are lol <br /><br />she then gets mad and says: wtf? is this some kind of joke... get out of there!!<br /><br />I say: no please don&#039;t come in... I&#039;m not done yet...<br /><br />At this point the hot water I was using to try and dissolve my sh!t was releasing sh!t smelling vapours all over the room.. and it was pretty rancid... the girl could smell it and she said: &quot;why the hell does it smell so ****ing bad? What the hell are you doing in there???&quot;<br /><br />I say: please don&#039;t come in... trust me.. you&#039;ll regret it...<br /><br />she says: **** this... get out now or I&#039;m unlocking the door..<br /><br />I beg her not too... but she loses her patience and then opens the door. She stops dead in her tracks. There before her was me standing with a pseudo-erect penis, left over fecal residue on my ass,large semi dissolved turds in her bathtub, turds on the floor beside her toilet, and pee all over the floor in front of the can... I was so ****ing embarassed... I started shivering... she looks at me while covering her mouth and nose and whispers... &quot;wtf did you do???&quot;...she was starting to cry... I hesitate for a bit and I try to explain myself &quot;I tried my best ... I... I&#039;m sorry&quot;... She then flips out and tells me to clean up the mess or she&#039;s calling the cops. I agree to do it.<br /><br />She leaves, and I grap some toilet paper... pick up the turds from the floor and bathtub, toss them in the can, and then I proceed to clean off the floor and bathtub with soap, water and alot of tissues. I tossed most of the tissues into her toilet bowl (the garbage was full eventually). I then took some perfume from the counter and tossed into the bathtub to get rid of odour. After I was done I cleaned my ass off and flushed the toilet. To my utmost dismay, my massive fecal matter bulk and the large amount of TP unded up clogging the toilet and it overflowed and started spilling crap all over the floor... I&#039;m literally crying at that point... I look for the plunger but I couldn&#039;t find it so I put my pants on and rushed out to ask her if she had a plunger so I could fix the toilet...I see her with her roommate and her roommates bf... she&#039;s crying... as soon as she sees me she tells me to gtfo right now... I try to explain that the toilet is clogged... but she doesn&#039;t let me ... she says she feels threatened and she wants me out now... she graps a knife from the drawer and tells me to leave... I leave.<br /><br />about a minute later I hear this loud scream coming from her dorm room (I assumed she went back to the washroom to see it covered in poo water). At that point I sprinted away as fast as possible, while swearing at myself and crying tears of frustration and embarrasment.<br /><br /><br />All of this could have ****ing been prevented if I had just brought my goddamn pee bottles!!! WTF?!?! The FIRST girl that shows interest in me.. I have to go and **** in her bathtub???? This is ****ing retarded (yes mad). <br /><br />to all you people saying &quot;peeing in bottles is stupid/gross&quot;... well **** that... not only is it more convenient and cleaner, but it also prevents epic disaters like this one....<br /><br />This is what WOULD have happened if I had my trustee pee bottle... I would have on sat on the can and then simultaneosly peed into the bottle and pooed into the toilet. No disaster... no mess.... and none of this would have happened.<br /><br /><br />anyway... should I let things cool off for a bit and call her back? maybe to apologize/explain myself? or should i just hope I never run into her again?

				I remember reading this exact text way, way back in my dial-up days.<br /><br />Talk about your old-school copypastas!<br /><br />Not sure what&#039;s funny about it, but the science behind evaporation is a good point to note as it applies to armpits and other body parts as well. I&#039;m so damn ugly and hate-filled I could never get a girl anyway, but letting my chest remain bushy is a great thing to do in humid summers.
