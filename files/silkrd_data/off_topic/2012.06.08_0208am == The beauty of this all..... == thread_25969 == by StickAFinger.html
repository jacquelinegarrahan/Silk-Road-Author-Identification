				Ive been a member for a while now ( finally enjoying the splendors of the forums, you people are awesome..got my karma abilities today! BIG FUCKING TITS! ) and i remember my first wave of excitement on all that was available on this monster site. <br /><br />Not going to lie, the first time, i went NUTS. im talking Hunter S Thompson, briefcase of wonders, nuts. large amounts and shit. and to my surprise....100% success with all the large ones. I remember the state of anxiety/excitement...it was an awesome feeling (one of my first purchases? XANAX, makes sense)<br /><br />how great is looking through the vendors, the drugs, peoples recommendations...im finally leveling off the OCD of it all....<br /><br />and it was so funny, showing my *cooler* friends (we all have layers of friends, some that are cool with some drug, others with another, and some with none)&nbsp; on all this, and getting a premium off getting them shit...but i now stopped that as well.. and playing the &quot;im over it ..yeah enjoyed it while i can&quot; card. cause fuck them.<br /><br />but again ...i kinda &quot;matured&quot; ..i just reaaallly love this fucking website in a..i need to protect my baby kind of way<br /><br />To be honest, I have no idea what the fuck im getting at, but i just hope there is alot of you like me that respects this shit out of this place and I have no idea what i can do to sustain this place but if donating to the big cheeses? or whatever..im down like gravity to help!<br /><br />other than that, i did a shit load of opium tea tonight after a 10 mile run and im melted and feeling like jaba the hut...im gonna make my gf smack my ass and laugh at her as i feel jack shit, that beautiful fucking bitch. <br />you guys are all my best friends and Im giving you all cybernetic high fives.<br /><br />this is my first drugged up forum post. probably gonna regret it but whatever. <br /><br />BUTT SEX<br /><br />

				Bro, when i found this place.... it was as if Mufasa, himself was giving me the pride lands ( Lion king reference )<br /><br />I spent hours and hours going from vendor to vendor, looking at all the cool things they had for sale, and how well priced the drugs were as compared to local street prices i have seen. ( some were even the same as im use to )<br /><br />SR, and its creators have brought us a wonderful tool.<br /><br />Ever since i joined SR and began purchasing my narcotics through its various vendors, I&#039;ve been enjoying life quite a bit more. I was always bummed that the drugs i loved to do, were so god damn hard to find...and SR was my solution....And unlimited supply of uppers, downers, stimulants, and depressants, Weed, coke....Anything my child like sense of wonder could imagine of poisoning my body with for fun, was at my finger tips....And it felt....GREAt!

				I felt the same way. After i confirmed the legitmacy of this place, I went out and bought a vintage Medical clutch and modified it with all kinds of compartments and little vial straps to keep everything in. Tis a work of beauty and i believe the great Thompson would be proud. I wish he could be alive to see this place. I think he would be proud.<br /><br />May the great spaghetti monster in the sky rain down blessings upon DPR, limitless and everyone else that make this place work smoothly.<br /><br />I hope that SR lives long and prospers.

				=/ I donno man, i dont really think celebs would need a place like this to get there drugs...Pretty sure that stuff usually comes with the territory of being a celeb. <br /><br />But TV actors, and no named has-beens from the 80&#039;s-90&#039;s im sure they use it hahahahha

				Yeah, true. Charlie Sheen doesn&#039;t need no Silk Road. But hell I bet SR has members from every corner of society, I wonder if any LEOs actually purchase drugs for personal use. Haha.<br /><br />And yeah, there are smart drug users, and there are very stupid drug users. Most people are stupid, drug users or not. I was reading an article the other week about how drug use might be linked to higher intelligence or education or something, talking about all the extremely successful entrepreneurs and CEOs that have used drugs etc. I think there is somewhat of a truth to it, if you don&#039;t think for yourself and believe everything thrown your way you won&#039;t get far. Well maybe you will, but you&#039;d get further if you questioned things.

				Lol, yea. its like the country club of drug dealers and purchasers. <br /><br />Certain requirements must be met to even see this place as it is. <br /><br />So obviously, if your here on SR and reading, or buying.<br /><br />You sir/madam have a brain, can maneuver the Interwebs in stealth, and even found your way into a part of a world wide network of drug dealers, buyers, and Enthusiasts alike :D<br /><br />Pat on the back everyone of SR, And a cookie aswell. <br /><br />Being smart and tech savvy is such a useful thing hahahaha

I personally know 2 that have bought drugs from dealers i have gone through, or still go through on occassion. ( SR is just so damn convenient, i sometimes find myself so lazy, id rather wait 3 days and not have to go anywhere to get my drugs, haha. )<br />So, im sure there are some LE that purchase narcotics on here for personal use.<br /><br />Edit: And on a side note....to any Dirty/Drug Addicted LE here on SR. FUCK YOU, YOU ASSHOLE. its unfair that you get to live in the grey area of right and wrong, and we&#039;re forced to do our deals on the wrong side of the law, while you get to sit there blazed as fuck, without a care in the world.

				Reich means Empire in German.. :P Hitler wanted to build the Third Reich and all that... ::)<br /><br />As the Ketamine goes, I&#039;d start with around 25-35mg cause Reich&#039;s stuff is very strong, since it&#039;ll be your first time I would start it slow. :)
