				I&#039;ve been wanting to try MDMA for a while now after being intrigued by some of the reports on Erowid...<br /><br />I have decided to give it a try this weekend but I&#039;d like a bit of advice on what to buy and how to take it..<br /><br />One would assume MDMA crystal is better than powder or pills which may be cut? But I guess with crystal tho you <br />could be risking something cooked up in someones kitchen (badly) and so you need a reliable supplier right?&nbsp; Am <br />I right in thinking &quot;yellow crystal&quot; or crystal that is brown etc is a sign of impurities and it&#039;s better to go for <br />something clear as possible?<br /><br />Next to the dosing question...assuming I go for the MDMA crystal...how much is a safe starting dose for<br />someone who never took it before who is quite sensitive to drugs (2 cups of tea gives me the jiggers!)? 70mg? 100mg?<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in the possible therapeutic value of MDMA, not getting off my face on it. I suffer with social anxiety and have trouble communicating and relating to people so I&#039;m wondering if an occasional low dose might open me up to people more and help me to improve my interpersonal skills? Or perhaps its a bad idea to use MDMA like this?

				What&#039;s your weight? I would go with 140mg. for the first time, unless you&#039;re lightweight (it will be best experience ever, so you wanna get as much as possible from it). <br />If you buy from one of the trusted vendors on SR you are very likely to get very pure mdma, color doesn&#039;t really mean much.<br />MDMA definitely helps to open up, it&#039;s great to take together with friends, it&#039;s great at parties with bunch of strangers too.

				100 mg each of ivory&#039;s or chembro&#039;s was plenty enough for me and my mates. 140mg could be too much for a first time, especially if your getting real quality mdma.

				2mg/kg is the generally accepted high end dose. If you take 100-120mg you&#039;ll get the full effects as long as it&#039;s quality stuff.

You&#039;ve picked the perfect substance given to mankind! MDMA is exactly what you want!<br /><br />From the information you&#039;ve given, and for what you&#039;re after, I would go with a dose between 95-110mg. I&#039;ve used the calculation of 1.5-1.7/k of mdma. I don&#039;t think you need/would want more than this, it may be too overwhelming being a first time. <br /><br />

				100 mg of some quality crystal MDMA is actually more than enough for someone using for the first time. Ivory and Skyy and a few other sellers here always have real quality MDMA - colour varies but its all clear with a hint of colour or several colours - yellow, pink, purple, brown even. <br /><br />I am a middle-weight guy and some of my mates who are heavy weights were ALL blown away with just 100mg of MDMA crystal.<br /><br />The pills here - the speaker pills made two people high as a kite - one clinging onto the arms of the chair. Anyone using for the first time might be overwhelmed by the actual real MDMA they are ingesting. This is the REAL thing, clean, potent and 100mg is more than enough for virgins. For cautions sake I would advise 80mg with up to 40mg carried in a &#039;bomb&#039; (wrap in some rolling paper so you can swallow) as an &#039;option&#039; for later on to extend the 5 hours into 8 or so IF needs arise.<br /><br />100mg of Ivorys MDMA really did put me into lift off mode last weekend. I was clinging to my women like a child and had to &#039;take five&#039; to get my head together to go out to the pub. Hugging all that crossed my path. You need a &#039;sitter&#039; on this or a buddy who will stick with you. Women more so I guess - its easy to fall in love with anyone but bear that in mind and go out with some friends who will keep an eye on you!<br /><br />MDMA is a powerful drug. The main danger is that you follow the rules and really enjoy yourself. Its VERY good but please don&#039;t think that it is a drug you can use every weekend and if you use one night - forget about the next night unless its a festival or some really special once in a year thing. <br /><br />MDMA is not to be abused and the best way to enjoy it is to use it maybe a few times a year. <br /><br />Please do not abuse it and become some headline that spoils it for the rest of us.

				There are plenty of articles addressing the potential benefits of MDMA for therapeutic purposes. Plenty of accounts before stricter laws and eventual banning of it in &#039;85, of how people with PTSD or high anxiety esp in social situations ended up making awesome gains with just one dose and session on MDMA and psychotherapy.<br /><br />If you ain&#039;t going to be getting psychotherapy (doubtful cause therapists using this on the side/downlow with their patients are rare, but they exist!) I would recommend some points with your first time.<br /><br />1) Before you roll or just when you take it contemplate/write issues you feel causing your anxiety. That way as you climb your way to your peak you can start to REALLY contemplate on them. This would be awesome with a trusted friend to help chat about these things with a hell have them roll with you (if they want). <br /><br />2) Though I&#039;ve heard many positive reviews of people taking MDMA alone and having awesome experiences with introspect on their life, problems, etc. I would definitely recommend going out! Hit the clubs, a party, go an a walk with a friend in the city or somewhere with lots of sensory integration to help you open up your experiences to a beautiful take on the world. <br /><br />3) If you do go out with peeps, talk it up! Start to chat (under supervision it being your 1st time) with different people about whatever! When I dropped the first time went to a rave and can&#039;t believe how many strangers I had awesome conversations with. That night really helped me come out of my shell from that point on in my life.<br /><br />First time is always the best and with great quality MDMA, oh man I&#039;m excited and happy for you. Do your research on MDMA safety as well. Hydrate, but don&#039;t OVER HYDRATE, etc. One of the great things I found is that my first MDMA trip helped me open my mind to a new perspective on a what i thought was a crappy no road to hope life. My out look changed that night, remembering the whole experience the next day. Those thoughts, outlook, emotions, etc have all stayed with me since. I used when I was 17 til about 20, and in that time I only would drop like 2-3 times a year, but went to many raves, dances, parties, etc. cause those were just too damn fun to pass.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck Demetri! Be safe, and have fun.

				All MDMA is brown at some point. It turns white when you wash it in acetone, this also makes it slightly purer. I like brown sugar molly over white, decreases the chance of other white rcs and stuff being mixed in, they just cant blend with large molly chunks.
