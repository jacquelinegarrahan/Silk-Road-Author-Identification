				I don&#039;t. <br /><br />&nbsp;I was never majorly into drugs, but I live in an area where good drugs are hard to come by because everyone&#039;s focused on meth synth&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />For example, I didn&#039;t know different strains of weed had legit different effects until I started getting from the road.<br />Maybe it&#039;s easier for you guys in big cities, but here it&#039;s just a hassle, and since LE has nothing to do, everyone can be under radar.<br /><br />I so don&#039;t miss the days of having to ninja around to get middies, or wait for &quot;LSD/shroom&quot; season around a local campus.&nbsp; ::)

				Never. Not even once. I have never purchased drugs on the street and I never will. I almost tried to the other day for some dope, but fuck that. I&#039;ll stick with the good shit on SR. I&#039;m patient. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m fiending for it or anything, I can wait a week or so, or pay for express if necessary. And weed I grow.

				I have up until recently when I made a few orders. Depending on how good the stuff here is, I&#039;ll probably stick to it. the prices are more or less the same as I have to pay here, so if the stuff is better here it makes no sense to buy shit off the streets. <br />I sometimes have sudden urges to smoke weed though, but I figure I&#039;d just buy more when I buy from SR so I have some back-up weed for those sudden urges :)

				I only use the road to get drugs i cant get of the streets, but this is mainly because i have a hand at providing drugs to the streets (weed, coke, MDMA and XTC pills) I have had many years of doing this so have some solid connections for high quality stuff. However I need the road for drugs such as lsd, shrooms, ketamine (at the moment), and MXE

				What do you mean by &quot;the streets&quot;?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d be surprised if many buyers here had ever relied regularly on literal street corners.

				Yes I still use &quot;the streets&quot;. But calling it &quot;the streets&quot; is very misleading. I have VERY GOOD connections. My dealers are mostly good friends, and many of them deliver. Its actually safer and more convenient than SR. However, SR offers more variety and quality, especially for LSD and MDMA. I can&#039;t get that on &quot;the streets&quot;. There&#039;s also a lot of exotic substances I can&#039;t get IRL here on the Road such as DMT or opium. It&#039;ll come through town once in a blue moon, but here on SR I can get it whenever I want ;D

				Still using irl connects for quality hash and weed which are much, much cheaper than on SR. Can also source excellent coke occasionally irl (and ordinary &quot;coke&quot; anytime but never bother). Having said that I am steadily sampling the more quality coke on SR and enjoying doing so.<br /><br />Am enjoying having regular access to quality exotic psychedelics through SR though, and really appreciating the choice

				For buying small quantities of things like weed, it isn&#039;t really worth using the SilkRoad unless you are an adult who rarely smokes at all. But for a young person who may need a gram or two for the weekend it makes much more sense to phone a dealer and have him drop it to you as it&#039;s cheaper, faster and to be quite honest less hassle in relation to what it&#039;s worth.

				Only when I want some drug in some party but I don&#039;t have any some random event.<br />Anyway, every time I do it I regret myself for not having brought anything..

				I live near a &#039;big&#039; city and drugs are pretty easy to come by. I wouldn&#039;t call it buying off the street. Most of my friends sell different drugs, nothing serious. Most of them just to support their habits or to just make a little extra spending money. All it usually takes is a text message and someone is heading over to my place or I just go over to their place, kick it for a little bit and get my shit. I could get good weed cheaper than the road has it so I never bought weed from here. I don&#039;t smoke anymore so I don&#039;t really buy anymore drugs off the street. The shrooms are cheaper on the road and I know I&#039;m getting real L on the road, so that&#039;s a plus.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				After finding silkroad I&#039;ve completely stopped buying IRL<br /><br />reason : quality<br /><br />the only drugs i&#039;m into are mephedrone and cocaine. both of them are bashed to fuck on the street. Pretty sure most of the meph is 3mmc and the cocaine is sold at £25g($39) and the quality of atrocious

				For weed I use the streets. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll use SR for bud anytime soon because it&#039;s just twice as expensive and I don&#039;t want to take a gamble on getting caught with smelly bud coming through mail. But I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be using the streets for anything else other than bud as long as my first purchase comes through smoothly (I&#039;m still waiting).

				Years ago, I did, but these days its too dangerous and the quality of UK street coke for example is dangerous.<br /><br />Buying E off the street or in a club is foolish unless you can EZ test it.<br /><br />Someone I know was hospitalised with a &#039;bad E&#039;, luckily they lived but others have not been so fortunate.

				Buying from dealers on the street is soo unreliable.&nbsp; I hate buying drugs off random people.&nbsp; The only drug I buy anymore around here is the weed, its straight from California anyway.. although I am considering changing that because it seems that I can get more variety and better prices on SR. There is just so much more trust on sr than on the street

				It&#039;s weird. Since I&#039;ve started using SR, the &quot;streets&quot; have come to me. Me and a buddy messed around with shrooms, weed, xtc, etc. sampling my stockpile of SR goodies and he said it&#039;s the best/cleanest **** he&#039;s ever come across.

				For myself , SR has been a breath of fresh air so to speak . The dramas and problems that my meth suppliers use to bring daily for me to sort out aged me ten years lol. I wouldn&#039;t buy from the street again. Sr is just too good , point, click , order and receive . The big plus is i get to keep my sanity !
