				Encraption (encryption) is bs? Encryption keeps us out of jail and anonymous, which is the point. Given your spelling and business prowess, I can&#039;t imagine this will be successful venture.

				So...let&#039;s get this straight....<br /><br />- No Encryption<br />- no bitcoin<br /><br />WELL...first off lets point out, that you are an illiterate nigger, who just wants to come up with &quot; Ideas &quot; and act like a kingpin... while the geniuses who would program such a place work harder than you, build your ideas...Yea...Real good plan there bro..<br /><br />2nd off, no encryption? and no bitcoin?<br /><br />You&#039;re a fucking moron....<br /><br />Encryption helps protect us from Law officers, and bitcoin makes it to where our transactions are anonymous and not linked to us.<br /><br />Your basically trying to make a site, with virtually no protection for its users.<br /><br />Im not sure if your aware, but drugs and mailing drugs, is highly illegal...so your best interest would be to keep customers protected...which you&#039;re right out saying &quot; Fuck that bullshit &quot;<br /><br /><br />Get off of SR, go back to school, and make something of yourself you two bit crack smoking cunt.<br /><br />People like you are the ones that end up in jail and could have done 1,000 things to prevent it.<br />But because you&#039;re too fucking dumb, you don&#039;t.<br /><br />

				Judging by the way you write I think you are lacking some essential skills needed to run a black market site. Here are a few pointers.<br /><br />1. Spelling, start out with simple words like FBI and bitcoin, once mastered move on to more complex complete sentences such as: no officer that server is not mine or I think I am going to be gang raped in my cell tonight. <br /><br />2. Numeracy, here you need to learn about numbers. I suggest watching back to back episodes of sesame street. The ones where Big Bird and that green trash monster teach you how to add up by singing.<br /><br />3. Learn to prepare for the worst. Inevitably you are going to go to prison. Prepare for such an occurrence by sitting down 20 minutes a day and imagining yourself being pounded by every sexually repressed lifer on your wing. <br /><br />and so on and so on. <br />ACE
