				Okay, not much response from that one....how about<br /><br />&nbsp;Twas The Night To Make Crystals<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Twas the night to make crystals and all thru the hood, compounds were reacting like I knew that they would. The hood door I shut with the greatest of care, to keep noxious vapors from filling the air. The tweekers were all at home in their beds, while visions of ice cycles danced in their heads. <br /><br />The reflex condenser was hooked to the tap while the perculator had a freshly filled trap. Just as I sat down to finish my task, I knew boiling chips were dancing merrily in the flask. When all of a sudden there came such a clatter, that I sprang from my chair to see what was the matter. <br />When, what to my watering eyes should appear, but a vicious black oil that once had been clear. When all of a sudden, things went off with a blast, I don&#039;t know what happened but I had to move fast. My nose was quite red, my eyebrows were bare, the blast had singed off nearly all of my hair. <br /><br />Just like McGuyver, so lively and quick, I knew in five minutes, that slurry&#039;d be thick, More rapid than crackers get hooked on cocaine. I laid lines on the table and four bag whores came. Now Dixey, now Trixey, Stop all your bitchen! Grab Ronda, and Rosey thereâ€™s a fire in the kitchen! <br /><br />Just in case we get scorched, or someone makes a call... Put the stash away, the hash away, and the cash away yall. And Before that fire got way out of hand, we all put it out with six buckets of sand. By the time it was over, the shit looked like glue, the sand turned to mud and the girls were beat too. <br /><br />I extracted that slurry again and again, with ether and then dicloromethane, Chromeographic techniques were applied, several times til the product had been purified, til I finally viewed with a satisfied smile, one half of a gram in a shiney new vial.<br />&nbsp;
