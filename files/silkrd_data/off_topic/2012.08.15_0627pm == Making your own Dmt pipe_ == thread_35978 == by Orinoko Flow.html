				I&#039;d make a Machine pipe. Made specifically for smoking DMT. It&#039;s the easiest and the best way to conserve your spice. I would say go on over to DMT nexus and read up on it but I can kind of give you the idea of it here.<br /><br />You just need a glass bottle, copper scrubber(like the ones for cleaning dishes), and some sort of straw. You make two holes in the bottom of the glass bottle(diamond drill bit recommended, but you can just use a screwdriver and hammer if you get lucky). One is a carb and the other hole is where the straw goes in (this is where you suck in when you smoke). You must torch the copper scrubber to get all of the crap that&#039;s on it off. Best to put it fully inside an open flame. Keep burning it until smoke stops rising and you should be good.<br /><br />To smoke it, you open up the copper scrubber, put some spice inside of it, then stuff it inside the mouth hole of the bottle, with a metal wick coming out of the bottom. So you can just put the flame right on the tail for a few seconds, then start toking.<br /><br />DMT nexus will definitely have better information and walkthrough.

Wouldn&#039;t the mouth of the bottle, even stuffed with the copper scrubber, let enough air through to be effective? Not trying to pick holes in your description or anything, but as someone who tried and failed to make one of these I&#039;d say anyway you can reduce what you have to do to the bottle the better :P Of course because I failed making it I just may not know what the hell I&#039;m talking about at all...

I just hold the flame slightly above the DMT, basically like how you would smoke hash if placed on top of bud

But you hold it just like you would imagine you&#039;d hold it. Upside down, cap down. I hold it an at angle so you can ONLY burn the tip of the copper scrubber. Since the goal is to not get the flame near the spice at all, and let it vaporize by the copper getting hot.<br /><br />@spunkaroo<br />Yeah I suppose so. The carb hole shouldn&#039;t be much more work though. If you didn&#039;t have a drill then I would say do it without the carb hole, and if you have one, do the carb on a comfortable spot on the side. As long as its all made good and the straw has a good seal it will have good suction and work good.
