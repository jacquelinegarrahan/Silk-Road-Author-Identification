It would be awesome if there were a link next to each feedback that took you to a forum discussion about the issue. Obviously if the feedback was a 5/5 there would be no discussion, but if a user left negative feedback the vendor would have a chance to defend him/herself against said allegations.

				It would be nice if there was SOME way to comment on feedback so that buyers couldn&#039;t abuse it (or screw it up because they don&#039;t know SR &quot;protocol&quot;)<br /><br /><br />A lot of new buyers seem to misunderstand how SR feedback works. The only good rating is 5 of 5. <br /><br /><br />It gets even more frustrating when you sell a lot of edibles like I do... there are a lot of lookie-loo buyers who&#039;ve never tried edibles and don&#039;t now what to expect. Instead of rating my services (which are AWESOME, btw) they rate how much they get blazed 20 minutes after nibbling a chunk of what they got. How the heck could I control that experience???<br /><br /><br />/end second rant&nbsp; &gt;:( <br /><br /><br /><br />

				It would be nice if vendors actually sold what they advertised. There&#039;s only a few vendors on here that actually have the quality they describe and it&#039;s bullshit to have to deal with these shitty types of vendors every other order.<br />&nbsp; <br />They should start banning vendor accounts or at the least giving them a suspension for selling something different from what they advertise.
