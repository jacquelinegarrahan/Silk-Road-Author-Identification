				Hi fellow SRs,<br /><br />I have read this: The Secret Chief: Conversations with a pioneer of the underground psychedelic therapy movement. http://www.maps.org/secretchief/sctoc.html, and it is pretty impressive. It is about curing neuroses, traumas and mental illness with psychedelics. People who had been going to ten years of psychotherapy and was cured with some psychedelic sessions. I&#039;d say that guy is something like a saint, a truly good person who lived to help others. He used mainly LSD, MDA, MDMA, something similar to Ayahuasca and Iboga. The book has prologues by Hoffman (inventor of LSD), Sasha Shuling (inventor of MDMA and many other psychedelics) and Stan Grof (pioneer in psychedelic therapy), so it seems like he was somehow famous in the underground psychedelic psychoterapy in the US.<br /><br />What do you think of this? maybe modern psychiatry is missing something that the shamans have known for thousands of years? if all this is true, so much human suffering could be prevented if this could be made mainstream that is such an enormous pity.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also, the reason I am writing this is because I am looking for somewhere where they could give me a hand with this kind of therapy (preferably in Europe).<br />Thanks.

				Hi Core.. Ahh the famous book by Myron Stolaroff.. I have this book in my playlist so to speak, to read list.. <br />Have heard few podcasts featuring Myron @ Psychedelic Salon.. His was truly shining person..<br /><br />Actually the &quot;modern&quot; psychiatry is missing everything.. First of all psychiatry is here not for helping people at all..<br />Shrinks are the part of the gov prosecution system and work closely with the police.. When they don&#039;t they just get paid <br />for having people locked up, for keeping em away.. Anyway they do more damage than they heal..<br /><br />The substances they use like benzos, tranqs and fucking neuroleptics are truly evil.. I even have this idea that<br />neuroleptics are the antipodes of psychedelics in the universe where duality rules.. I speak from my personal experience..<br /><br />Perhaps psychology should heal soul and use psychedelics as valuable tools in the future..<br />Psychology and psychiatry are very different in basic motivations and goals..<br />But as you said it right currently psychology is six feet underground..<br /><br />Maybe i can feel what you mean.. These are the very precious remedies which can cure so many suffering indeed..<br />And open up so vast horizons of thinking and creativity of visionary wisdom, besides hardcore addiction treatment which they can.<br />Though I&#039;ve discovered that dissociatives can cure chemical or mental addictions far better than anything else..<br /><br />But this world is a fucked up one.. The raging race of barbarians.. Headpieces stuffed with straw..&nbsp; <br />Psychedelics never should be mainstream by definition and experience itself..<br />The karmapolice is in action.. So stealth is the way..<br /><br />Albert said once that having such valuable tools and not using them<br />would be insane for the mankind.. And currently it is..<br />

				i have been chronically ill for the past decade and i don&#039;t know where i&#039;d be if it weren&#039;t for psychedelics. they&#039;ve renewed my love for life and allowed me to start the healing process after years spent in my own isolated hell. i view them mainly as therapeutic tools, as i have seen firsthand how transformative they can be. the power to heal is always within us and psychedelics can help us realize this. never underestimate the power of your own mind. what you think, you become... so think healthy. ;D

Psychedelic therapy is an incredibly powerful tool. Also threatening to the upper class, as some realizations, had by enough people, would likely transmute human society into a diversely textured web of inter-operating points, instead of a fucked up pyramid. Everybody would feel much more equal, with nobody really accumulating power beyond what&#039;s at hand any given moment because they can&#039;t maintain power over people who are aware and sovereign. This would create a drive to be more immediately capable, which would be good for humanity, but the loss of the power structure abused by the upper class makes it too costly for them to simply allow it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />couldnt agree more.<br /><br />I have thought this to be true for a bit and was actually explaining it to someone recently.
