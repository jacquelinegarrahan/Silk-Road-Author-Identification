				Was chatting in the other topic about movies and I said that I pirate the majority of my movies, but if it&#039;s good I&#039;ll pay for it when it&#039;s released, and I did just that and purchased The Killer Inside Me since it reminded me. I watched The Killer Inside Me a long time ago and thought it was an amazing movie, if movie awards were for actual performances and not based on just money generated or hype then Casey Affleck would have won best actor hands down.<br /><br />It also has Kate Hudson (his wife) and Jessica Alba (his girlfriend), and list of other big actors. From Amazon&#039;s description:<br /><br />Sadism and masochism beneath a veneer of revenge. Lou Ford is a mild-mannered sheriff&#039;s deputy in a Texas oil town in the mid 1950&#039;s. His boss sends him to roust a prostitute living in a rural house. She slaps him; he hits her, then, after daily sex for the next few weeks, he decides it&#039;s love. She&#039;s devoted to him and becomes his pawn in a revenge plot she thinks is to shakedown the son of Chester Conway, the town&#039;s wealthy king of construction. Lou has a different plan, and bodies pile up as murder leads to murder. The district attorney suspects Lou, and Conway may have an inkling, but Lou stays cool. Is love, or at least peace, in the cards?

				For myself can I substitute &#039;buying&#039; with &#039;going to see&#039;?&nbsp; Im like you - pirate everything, however occasionally a flick will come along that I feel deserves to be seen on the big screen or I want to see so badly that I wont wait to pirate.&nbsp; Most recent was &#039;Avengers Assemble&#039;, felt that to do the special effects justice had to be seen on big screen.&nbsp; Also &#039;Gladiator&#039;, when I saw this in the cinema, first time we are shown the colesseum the hairs on the back of my kneck stood up.

				Even before pirating became mainstream, I never bought movies because I just felt money could always go to better things. But thank god for Pirate Bay, I can&#039;t remember the last time I&#039;ve been bored. The only movies I own are gifts from my friends lol&nbsp;

				Hulu and sidereel are good ones too, for tv shows that is. I&#039;ve been loving the tv series &#039;Whites&#039;, it&#039;s a British comedy about a chef&#039;s kitchen in an upscale tourist hotel.

				Hulu is incredible bandwidth, but they have commercials. I don&#039;t mind, especially since they have a little Yes/No button in the top right for you to click if the commercial is relevant or not. I&#039;ve been trying to use it to filter commercials so I only have the ones with hot women in them, so far it&#039;s not working that well.<br /><br />Sidereel is just a link collector but it&#039;s well managed, gives you several link options and I&#039;ve yet to find something I couldn&#039;t watch due to all the links being broken.

				Even with the yes/no button are you still forced to endure at least a few seconds of the ad before being able to get rid of it?&nbsp;

I believe it&#039;s usually like 2 commercial breaks, a minute or so each, not a big deal. Some shows (like Whites) give you an option at the beginning if you want to view the normal commercials or instead watch a trailer for some show/movie and then watch the rest commercial free.
