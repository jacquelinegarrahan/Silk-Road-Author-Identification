				yo, plz help a nub out... ive done some research by reading around the forums here and looking to purchase my first coinage from here: BTCxUK, http://64d7qoqgjcw47vvz.onion.to/. have got tormail up and running, have sent them a mail and await response. Question is, once ive sent them monies will they then transfer the coins direct to the address in my SR account (which ive sent them)? Or do i need to dload and Ewallet for them to send to there, then i transfer them to my SR?<br /><br />help appreciated

Both methods would negate the need for a local BTC wallet. However, in answer to your question, no, you wouldn&#039;t need a BTC wallet if you intended on sending all your BTCs to your SR account.

Ok, that way seems good - have set up a wallet with blockchain, and a ping-it account. Saying deposits are currently disabled tho, due to them being low on bitcoins - that happen often? <br /><br />so, bank transfer or ping it &gt; direct into blockchain wallet &gt; SR account &gt; vendor
