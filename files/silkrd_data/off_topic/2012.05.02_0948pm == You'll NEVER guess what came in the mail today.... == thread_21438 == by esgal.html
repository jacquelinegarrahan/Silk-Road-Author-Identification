				Saturday 4/21, while that 4/20 sale was still going on I purchased some things from tony76, including 1 oz of Ketamine to re-sell to a couple friends of mine F2F, and some mdma for me to try...and just today to my surprise it was waiting for me in the mail.<br /><br />Dont give up hope guys! I was 110% sure tony scammed us all and left, but it was in my mailbox waiting for me :) I&#039;m gonna try it tonight and see how it goes

				Yea, right after I opened it I DEEEEPLY regretted it, I just waited for about 30sec half expecting to be raided, shitting my pants...and thanks for the warning, I&#039;m gonna put up 10g on SR in .5g quantities, and sell f2f/keep the rest for personal use :) I&#039;m going to try it tonight though, and will DEFINITELY be extremely careful with how much I take, and do my research first, as it will be my first experience with ketamine, I also got 2g of MDMA, should I try that at the same time? or should I just experience K alone first? (That is a question to experienced K users) :) SOOOO excited

				Yes, I did, but that was only for 1 night, during which I had no orders at all for him, I just stuck my neck out for a guy who seemed trustworthy...maybe he just sent my order to repay me for that?<br /><br />I can assure you I have no other connections with Tony at all, I&#039;m in an entirely different country

				Well great....now you guys have me like 1000x more worried.....I&#039;d like to think the amount of steps I take in receiving any packages are more then enough to be protected in court....but I think I&#039;m going lawyer shopping tomorrow....just to be safe....and I really hope its real, cuse I am god damned excited to try this :) I think Im gonna save the MDMA for another night though, just so I can experience the K itself, and report back on quality as best as possible, but again I&#039;ve never tried it before

I don&#039;t even have to defend his MDMA because it was tested and yes while it wasn&#039;t as strong as the MDMA found in the NL it was definitely still good MDMA. Whether or not he scammed everyone it doesn&#039;t change the fact that he was shipping out legit products.

				My take on the situation: Tony would feel bad scamming you because you resold some of his H at some point, and he generally liked you as a vendor. Therefore, he sent you what you ordered. Maybe a select few will still receive their packages if Tony liked you enough? Who knows at this point.

				HOLY FUCKING NIGERIAN TITTYS.<br /><br />Ironically enough, I have an answer to this mystery, thanks to kwiktrips 25i. Myself and some friends were hanging out. I put two tabs between my gums and upper lip for 30 minutes without swallowing or spitting. I got fucked up. Like. Holy shit. Ever seen a stick turn into a snake, then turn into a squid? Yea...<br /><br />Anyways, on to the part that answers this question. My girlfriend, who has done LSD before, let the tabs stick under her tongue for ~5 minutes, and then swallowed them because she didn&#039;t like the taste. She did NOT get fucked up. She said she &#039;Felt good&#039; but that was probably thanks to Delta11&#039;s brownies. (Fucking amazing, btw). She didnt see rainbowy patterns everywhere, and shit moving and twirling. I did. Same dose. Only difference is shes done LSD a few times, and this was my first psychedelic experience. So, this would lead me to assume that this chemical is not orally active.

				I swallow my LSD whole every time.<br />They can complex the NBOMe chems now so they are orally active... but the effects are different enough from LSD that you should be able to tell quite easily.&nbsp; Trip duration, onset and effects... this is LSD baby.<br /><br />Cross your fingers folks!<br /><br />I think he was busted myself, and any orders he managed to send out before being profiled will make it.<br />If he was caught, most of the packages will be nabbed by customs in various countries due to mail profiling.<br />RCMP wouldn&#039;t announce the arrest until after the investigation, as they&#039;re going to try to use Tony to catch other fish.

				I haven&#039;t bought anything from Tony in quite a while, not since his very first batch of LSD, but i can say definitively that back then his stuff was real. I reagent tested his LSD with Ehrlich and Marquis, his MDMA with Mecke, Marquis, Simons and Mandelin, and his Ketamine with the same. All three were legit. He may well have started sending bunk or fake shit later, but as of a month or two ago, his shit was real.
