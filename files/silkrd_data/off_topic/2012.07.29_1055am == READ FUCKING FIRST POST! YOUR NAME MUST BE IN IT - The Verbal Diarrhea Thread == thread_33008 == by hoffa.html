May latest attempt to get demoted, by dropping red wine &quot;accidentally&quot; on my bosses pretty yellow couch did not have the desired effects.

				Well limbo the conspiracy shit was from me but as a shrill&nbsp; ::) jks<br /><br />The thread idea is a comp thread to guess what &quot;motor&quot; Pimp daddy Lim rolls in! Obviously there will be an uniquely trademarked Hoffa twist but looking for sponsors for the correct/fucking funny as guess. I recon there is some good marketing to be had for the right *cough* Limbos market. <br /><br />Not asking for much maybe that cruze missile or something. There is a new UK coke vendor that will be hitting the street soon, I was one of the chosen ones to sample his wares. Thank fuck it was clearly imported and untouched. If I was to compare it, it was stronger than mins with the euphoria we all crave. Anyway he has offered a gram for a prize. <br /><br />So we could make one winner with a huge first prize. No money to enter and something to lighten the atmosphere and bring the community back together. I may even hit DPR up! <br /><br />Obviously I wouldn&#039;t enter ad that would be unfair for every cunt&nbsp; :P but I would be on the judging panel, with celebrity judges like say Generous Vendor contributors *hint hint* LIM!<br /><br />So thoughts, I know for a fact Gaza had just jizzed in his shorts.

				I learned today that the Wu-Tang Clan ain&#039;t nothin to fuck with.<br />I&#039;m a big fan of talking, especially a lot, but not so much AFK. I can type novels of conversation with just about anyone who shares my interests. I know there&#039;s a lot to be said here for that very raisin.<br /><br />On another note, a friend of mine payed me to have some of RedHempField&#039;s wonderful 25c-nBOME delivered to her. This was Thursday of last week (the 26th), and I ordered something for myself as well.<br />I live within a mile of a large and critical postal processing facility so I might just be lucky but I&#039;ve always had quick shipping within the US, couple days tops. She lives around 11 miles away from me so there might be a day or so delay, one would think.<br />Anyway my package arrived today and everything went lovely up until at around 3-4pm I get a seriously anxiety-laden phonecall from my friend because hers is not there yet. <br />I was at a rolling peak on 1.2mgs 25c and if anyone is familiar with it, you know how incredible just a single 600microgram dose is. The OEVs were amazing, fractal patterns covering everything and a thin skin of kaleidoscopic shapes over nearly everything. She just started wailing about how people paid her in advance and she is dependent on the package to pay for her vehicle repair and everything she has depends on this package.<br />I asked how this could be, her answer was that SHE IS SELLING THE RC AS LSD! <br />I could not be more embarassed and disappointed. Not really shocked, just a little surprised she had joined the ranks of those miscreants who are essentially misinformation agents of the psychedelic world. Not only are you depriving those of a true LSD experience but they might not even enjoy it and never have a chance to actually take the real thing. And even moreso, that she would flip about it not being as early as expected! The sheer lack of patience was enough to turn my stomach, the other half of the problem pushing me to mental nausea. <br />Before she could get through her entire reason as to why she was having a cow I just cut her off with &quot;H-hey I&#039;m really trying to soak up this peak of psychedelia and you&#039;re really bumming me out so let me just cut through all that bullshit and tell you there is nothing to worry about; your shit will come soon enough. Try to practice a little patience. Take deep breaths.&quot;<br />I&#039;ve never had any problem with RedHempField and wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it arrived promptly tomorrow, in which case I&#039;m definitely going to recommend she chill the fuck out.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t even snap on her about the bullshit she was pulling in the first place. I&#039;ll probably have quite a story once/if people don&#039;t dose correctly and seek refund from her. <br />Thought someone else might get a kick/load of rage/case of herpes reading this.

				i&#039;ve knocked smoking pot on the head, thats about it really. just couldn&#039;t handle my thought processes on it any more, proper paranoid fantasies lately. must be getting old or something. its a shame cos i&#039;m probably gonna flog my PS3 now - i just can&#039;t get into it if i&#039;m not stoned - i get too furious when i get shot and that puts me off my game. and it gets expensive cos i end up smashing the controller up in a rage &gt;:( might get some valium actually, see how my gaming is with a bit of that in me<br /><br />and working too hard obviously ::) but that goes without saying :P<br /><br />proper looking forward to the new series man :D

				Well what I&#039;m thinking is going to Barcelona, so there is a vendor (Nevita) of M1, 2C&#039;s and a few other similar drugs also shipping from Spain, so could get next day or 2-3 days maybe, so if I order as I leave the UK, it should be there after a day or so of being there...Poss try some coke from NL at same time, maybe a day earlier but the coke I got very easily in Barcelona last time was really good for street stuff as a lot of Colombians/SA&#039;s there....

U.K-to-U.K is easy street and I had a lot of domestic finalizations today but I&#039;m a bit concerned about the outgoing ones. Australia is a pig-fuck as well lately because like I said on other threads they have jacked up their security considerably for small letters because of SRs press.

Tried all sorts of supplements. Latest one was&nbsp; 600mg/day of chromium picolinate (after some research into my atypical depression) with my usual multi vits, high doses of vit c, zinc, magnesium, vit b6, q10, omega 3 and some other stuff, seems to have helped take the edge off it, you never know of its placebo with supplements tho because changes are always subtle. <br /><br />Recently tried all sorts of antidepressants and had a bad reaction to all of them, gave up on &#039;em for now. Citalopram was funky though, on the lowest dose I had hypomania after 2 days,&nbsp; felt like I was on a low dose of MDMA all the time, colours where bright and vivid and I was really positive and motivated, even euphoric, couple of days later I had some horrific chest pain and the doc took me off them. He didn&#039;t believe my hypomania tho.<br /><br />The only effective cure for my depression is a strict exercise program and diet (it has to be really strict)... real hard to get into when you are depressed tho. Unless I&#039;m running 10k 4 days a week and lifting weights 3 days I tend to slump into depression. Drugs, including alcohol, always seem to make my depression much worse, main reason why I hardly use drugs these days.

What you do, is get a plastic bottle and burn a hole in the end of it. Then fill it with water, keeping your finger on the hole so the water doesn&#039;t come out. Take the lid off and wrap tin foil around the opening of it with a few small holes in it. Place some weed in the tin foil and keep your finger over the hole at the bottom. When the weed starts burning, keep lighting it and take your finger off the hole at the bottom of the bottle and let all the water drain out. Once the water is gone, suck all the smoke out.

If you do say 20-40mg its more like an anti-depressant, 50-70 it&#039;s quite euphoric and 100mg+ is where ya start to wobble. This fluctuates depending on your weight though.<br /><br />Also try taking it with Mandy or Rip or another Stim, makes life way more interesting.

				i guess thats why i&#039;ve never been a coke head, so hit and miss! i keep my eyes peeled everyday for Liberpaters listings to come up.&nbsp; based on most write ups, its lovely clean stuff.<br /><br />i love the freedom of the road, how theres such difference between vendors, PF almost like a MNC, huge transglobal corporation! <br /><br />Liberpater = small time. lightyears away. patience required.<br /><br />....re-lissssst<br /><br />

				Lol I don&#039;t get special treatment from anyone mate because they dunno it&#039;s me. I wouldn&#039;t want any special treatment either. <br /><br />And I can tell if it&#039;s good quality product Pickles because I have aboooout 100 liters of Acetone and 50 liters of Clorox-bleach give-or-take and glassware laying around in my unit so testing Cocaine or anything else for that matter really isn&#039;t an issue for me to do. :P <br /><br />If you don&#039;t have those on hand (although you can easily buy the acetone and Clorox online for under £10) then you can tell if Cocaine is cut with base or other Caines because of the texture and/or the effect will be TOO numbing (pure Cocaine is only mildly anesthetic) and the buzz lasts longer than 45 minutes. If you feel wired off 100mg for 2 hours plus, your snorting a whole lot of base lol.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard LiberPater has high failure rate to the U.K? Anyone confirm or deny this?

And that analogy is an understated version. My friend who sells the stuff has sold stuff that was 20% and mostly base for £100 a gram and people have said &quot;Fackin blew me wig off geeza&quot; which was the actual verbatim of the phone conversation I listened to. I buy 10g here for what equates for £50 a gram....do the math. People in the U.K rarely have any real idea of what good Rip really is. <br /><br />And I sometimes wash it, depends how much I buy. I usually buy 5g at a time in which case I wash it, if it&#039;s anything less I don&#039;t coz then it lasts longer and 20% cut is ok in my book. I always do a mini-wash and Clorox test it for Amph and other Caines though.

				BanWork I know exactly what you mean. A friend of mine has tried the stuff I get from here and actually thought mine was shit compared to the under-20%-and-chopped-with-50%-speed shit.

I&#039;ve tried snorting Mandy but the drip is too vile for me&nbsp; :o.<br /><br />Hey TT, good to meet you&nbsp; :). Yeah, it was an intense experience to say the least. I&#039;m glad to have had it, but I&#039;m just going to stick to Drone from now on.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about giving my local Dave a ring for some Bing. But the fact I can get better gear from here is putting me off. <br /><br />Hmm.. would I fuck the queen? That&#039;s a tough one, part of me would like to so I can say I did. But the other part of me wouldn&#039;t for obvious reasons.

				Yeah I&#039;m going on a little excursion at the end of the month so I need to be well stocked for the trip. :D<br /><br />And I don&#039;t find the Mandy drip that harsh, it&#039;s easier than the one for cat. Just take it in my stride. I dab it as well though so that&#039;s always fun. :)<br /><br />Also fuck giving your local Dave a ring, no point when ya know it&#039;s gunna be shitter than what ya can get on here with a bit of patience and it&#039;s gunna cost you more. The price I got for the 30g was less than 50 spongles a gram for what is meant to be 85-89% pure (although I will be acetone and clorox testing those sunny forecasts).

I mean I don&#039;t mind visiting Dave if Dave turns out to be able to provide premium quality product but the problem is he wouldn&#039;t be called Dave then would he? He&#039;s be called something a bit more sexy like Sebastian Stormchaser or something ridiculous like that, he&#039;d probably even have an eye-patch too for dramatic effect. But Dave ain&#039;t called Sebastian nor does he have an eye-patch, he&#039;s called Dave because he&#039;s a Dave and has Dave standard Dave-bags which he&#039;ll charge standard-Dave prices to which you will feel Dave has taken the piss.<br /><br />All-in-all, fuck Dave.

				Not sure about that RD, never been a fan of Jacko. <br /><br />Also have any of you been keeping up to speed with these Russian &quot;Pussy Riot&quot; case? I have quite a lot of time for what they are doing but I think doing it in a church was fairly disrespectful, not like that. However what the fuck is that bit of gristle Madonna doing on stage with her granny tits out with Pussy Riot painted on her back at her age? How fucking undignified is that? She could have made a statement in a much better way than that.

				The Green Mile is fucking epic. Shawshank Redemption is better IMO, but The Green Mile is still ace. Ahh, never liked MJ, and I&#039;m quite young. I guess like with every drug, Weed has different effects on different people. I&#039;ve panicked out on it quite bad before, always gives me anxiety. Makes me paranoid a bit as well but I can handle a bit of paranoia, but it&#039;s not euphoric enough to be worth it.<br /><br />I wish I did like it though, its pretty cheap and easy to get hold of.

				Yeah its a case of time being of the essence and really like I said before with SuperTrips&#039;s price working out to £47 a gram + tracking/escrow and him guaranteeing it will land I&#039;m happy all round really. <br /><br />AfterHours never got back to me though so pft. If it&#039;s under 80% like Raouly said I don&#039;t wana know lol. <br /><br />And yeah, is nice to have the Old Spice gang back altogether. :)

Since I&#039;m only ordering quarter a gram and combined with the 0.2 i have already got from MrFire, that only makes ~0.45grams, of which i will be using all of on Monday/Tuesday depending on delivery haha. <br />The stuff i have already from MrFire is a sticky, minutely lumpy and powdery substance. It&#039;s pretty white and has a strong leafy, kerosene smell. Its very much unlike the standard stuff i have got from my local dealer Dave which looks yellow and smells like chemicals, Daves stuff was pretty horrible to say the least.<br />Do you still think its worth washing? I will be uploading pictures though when i have everything together, along with pictures of the bing + meph lines. ;)

Only the top drawer £120 UK vendors are worth looking at IMO. Dmtdoodeelsd from UK has some wicked stuff according to a prolific buyer on the forum who I trust, but you have to pay that much within the UK.

Ridiculous how she called me derogatory though, whats more derogatory than selling your vagina?&nbsp; ::) Or was that something the feminist movement deliberate forgot to add in perhaps? <br /><br />And not bad Shiz, how&#039;s your day been?

Only the top drawer £120 UK vendors are worth looking at IMO. Dmtdoodeelsd from UK has some wicked stuff according to a prolific buyer on the forum who I trust, but you have to pay that much within the UK.

I just thought it must be what he says it is because of the price unless he&#039;s ripping people off! Anyway, all will be revealed on monday/tuesday :)<br /><br />And LOL at this talltempress thing, pretty annoying i was away when all this kicked off but wtf, someone should just ban all of her accounts?

				Fuck it I&#039;m gunna show you real crazy. I sent these to RD and Shiz last night, you might all wana take a butchers - <br /><br />Message 1 - <br /><br />A real man stands by his woman no matter what!<br /><br />And you let some people you don&#039;t know, and never will know, probably a bunch of sad fifteen year old wankers hiding in mummy and daddy&#039;s basement, well, their maturity really comes off in that way, ruin it?<br /><br />REALLY?<br /><br />And I am not what you refer to as a &#039;whore&#039;, leave that to the streets!<br /><br />I am NOT a financially desperate drug addled whore!<br /><br />If I choose to indulge in drugs, I pay for my own!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I am on another level, I know my shit perfectly well, choose my clients very selectively, I don&#039;t see just anyone.<br /><br />I do what I do because I want to, not because I have to, and I do it very well, and I am happy to come into peoples lives and save them!<br /><br />I have saved marriages, I have stopped men from killing themselves, I have made many a man mentally, emotionally, and spiritually happy, there&#039;s a lot more to it than meets the eye!<br /><br />If it was just about &quot;the sex&quot; I wouldn&#039;t do it - That would be too fucking easy, and ruin my self respect, and appreciation for myself, my mind, body, and life!<br /><br />I am a carer. I am a social worker. I am a friend. I am a shoulder to cry on. I am an ear that listens. I never judge you whoever you are and whatever you do.<br /><br />Yes, the time costs, and that time doesn&#039;t come cheap, but what happens in that time is priceless!<br /><br />Psychologically, it can be tough though, so much shit that you have to keep in your head when your trusted, and let into someones personal life. I&#039;d never speak of what happened within the four corners.<br /><br />Even if someone put a cap to my head!<br /><br />Their trust. My honour. That&#039;s the agreement!<br /><br />You are aware that I operate completely above board?<br /><br />You do know this is an entirely legitimate and taxable profession in this country, don&#039;t you?<br /><br />There was actually NOTHING illicit or illegal there!<br /><br />It didn&#039;t infringe on your security, it infringed on mine, but you know what these fuckers would never get to meet me, they&#039;d never make it past first base!<br /><br />Their call would be terminated within 30 seconds, if I don&#039;t like the sound of you, the phone goes down!<br /><br />As you know, I am &#039;off the market&#039; now, and obviously, it&#039;s a work number, on special mobile phone for the purpose.<br /><br />Of course, you know about this shit, so no further details are necessary!<br /><br />Do you know why?<br /><br />Because my security is worse than yours!<br /><br />Normally it takes about three to four weeks of communication before I&#039;ll even consider meeting you!<br /><br />It&#039;s a very long process, but those who want it, will work with me, and those that don&#039;t won&#039;t!<br /><br />I have to be 100% satisfied that I actually want to meet whoever it is!<br /><br />Simple as that!<br /><br />My name is unconnected now, and still you fuck me up again!<br /><br />Just so you can get &quot;bigged up and + karmaed&quot; by these idiots that are inconsequential to your life.<br /><br />Where&#039;s the karma in your IRL life, Lim, think about it!<br /><br />You made the right decision there!<br /><br />You can sleep well tonight!<br /><br />Goodnight!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Message 2 - <br /><br />Well, you married me online!<br /><br />Remember?<br /><br />Delusional much?<br /><br />No you were never my man, but I was your woman, you choose me, and proposed TO ME!<br /><br />Crazy but true, huh?<br /><br />ONFUCKINGLINE, messed with my emotions, and put me through mental and emotional hell, doesn&#039;t happen very often, in fact only one &quot;man&quot; successfully managed before, and guess what in 25 years time, you&#039;ll be exactly the same cunt!<br /><br />Millions of pounds, manically depressed, on the very top, but sad, lonely, doing four grams of cocaine out of your office after hours, sleeping in your office, even spending Christmas in your fucking office, constantly paranoid about who, what, and why?<br /><br />Carry on Lim, and that will be you, but it doesn&#039;t have to be!<br /><br />Money the greatest of all blessings and the greatest evil!<br /><br />Choices have consequences, choose wisely!<br /><br />I suggest you read the message twice, think one, two, three times!<br /><br />You fire the gun, at the first sentence?<br /><br />Unfortunately the bullet missed the target, well it&#039;s you that mentioned target practice?<br /><br />Funny that, you need some, take a night off the boards, and get some!<br /><br />EPIC FAIL.<br /><br />Goodnight and Goodbye!<br />

				I know I&#039;m not supposed to post on this thread, I&#039;m just curious if any of you elder statesmen might have heard anything from DPR on how that paid holiday went with that 4/20 contest winner.<br />I assume DPR wouldn&#039;t tell anyone much about it, but I sure would like to know if it was fun or not, maybe just vague details. IIRC wasn&#039;t DPR supposed to join him? highly unlikely If so, I imagine it had the potential to turn awkward real quick.

				You should see what my local Dave has to offer. Absolute joke! His coke is yellow and stinks of chemicals, kinda like bleach! His drone, when he rarely has it is cut with god only knows what.

His weed is alright though ;) Nothing compared to what SR has to offer :) <br /><br />And Soll that sounds rather splendid. :)<br />

				Eh it&#039;s different when you smoke a blunt compared to a joint, since it burns much slower and it&#039;s usually in a relaxing environment, you get pretty stoned _but_ you don&#039;t really notice it until you leave the environment. Like I could be sitting on the couch smoking with a few friends for an hour or so, and not realize that I&#039;m high til I go to get some food lol. But it slows my train of thought down since I&#039;m pretty much always thinking about something and it&#039;s nice after a long ass day at work :)

				No fucking WAY could I invite a hooker to share some good loving!<br /><br />She would probably beat the shit out of me - or just go on a sex strike which means Mr Red is fucked or not fucked as the case may be!<br /><br />Pussy power, man, I got to say, it goes a long way! Well, it is not just a pussy, I love Mrs Red so would never bang a trick or even book a hotel for a night, get some good coke and go on some kind of sexual adventure. Of course I find other women attractive but I&#039;ve never banged any or even had a little feel.<br /><br />But I would say that if Mrs Red maybe got off with another women it would morally right for me to be there also.<br /><br />That aint going to happen.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />But every couple will eventually fantasize a little. Sometimes I like to think I met my wife aged 16 and could have taken her virginity. She won&#039;t go for the role playing unless I get some coke in. So now I been paid I got some coke in.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Ride me baby!

Also as i don&#039;t have any decent scales I went with the GM guy because his reviews are good and the caps where ~20mg each which seemed like a good dose, i just ordered 3 of them.

When you did 2cb did you snort it? if so, how much worse is the pain compared to snorting meph? Been researching it and apparently its one of the most painful drugs to snort, but people say the pain is worth it in comparison to taking it orally because the effects are better.&nbsp; ???

				The body load is quite heavy. However I snorted it so... Spent a few mins dry heaving lol. Oh and it burnt like a motherfucker, stick to oral!

				Snorting it would be fun if you&#039;re with mates. Can see who has the highest pain tolerance&nbsp; ;). Yes, Drone, K and MDMA sting a little. BUT this is a full on burn, I&#039;d describe the pain the same as snorting shredded metal that has been heated up and sprayed with chilli powder lol. But tbh you won&#039;t have to worry, doesn&#039;t MDMA increase pain tolerance as well? Have fun anyway!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />And not much, might get a dominoes pizza in and watch my soaps.

				2C-B is one of the most painful drugs to snort, even worse than crystal meth!! I&#039;m waiting on Googleyed for a gram.....We loves it we do!!! To be fair, I like to do the same as most bomb-able drugs....I take the bomb and insufflate a line or bump to bring on immediate onset but still get the full effects from swallowing the drug too!

				Oh man, I&#039;ll probably end up snorting a lil&#039; line just because I&#039;m curious as fuck as to how bad it is. I&#039;ll probably regret it right away buy hey ho, you only live once and all that. ::)<br />I was doing a bit of research as to why its so bad, apparently because its insoluble it doesn&#039;t get absorbed into the nasal membrane straight away, and the pain is from it sitting in your membrane waiting to be absorbed and because its pretty irritant it blisters the skin. Sounds nasty! Anyhow, can&#039;t wait to try the drug :) <br />Soll thats a pretty sick tune to be honest :)

Also, the intermediate banking jurisdictions like Switzerland, BVI and Seychelles are considered ML hot-spots so nobody that knows what they are doing runs money through those jurisdictions, it&#039;s asking for trouble. I wouldn&#039;t go near there and none of the people I know that work in the field would. Back in the day they were great but they all signed DTs with the world and it&#039;s Mrs now. Sell-outs. :(

				I am jealous of you guys. MDMA unfortunately doesn&#039;t do much for me. I took about 200 mg for my first time, and it was Dopeboys stuff which is suppose to be some of the best. I just kept waiting for it to get going, but the feeling never got to what I expected. I was just chill and watched TV and felt nice. I expected to feel super good and happy like I did on foxy, but to me it wasn&#039;t even half as good as my foxy experiences.<br /><br />I abstained from all substances for 6 weeks too and I don&#039;t take SSRI&#039;s.

				EZ DarkMonk I kind of know what you mean, it doesn&#039;t fill you with energy and want to dance all night like pills used to in days gone by. The reason is because there were other drugs in the pills that enhanced the speedy, rushy side of the buzz which you don&#039;t get from pure MDMA crystal. You can counter this by using another drug alongside like Mephedrone, Cocaine or even Amphetamine sulphate if nothing else....That way you get the bouncy, rushy, lively effects from the other drugs you choose to take plus the empathogen, lovey, friendly, warm glow feelings from the MDMA.....Lovely jubbly!!!&nbsp; ;D 8) Got to be done with other people, no good on ya own! <br /><br />Never tried Moxy/Foxy....I know Lim is packing some of that sheeeiiittt. Might have to give it a go soon! :) I hear it&#039;s an aphrodisiac and ramps up your sex drive? Whats the feeling &amp; effects of that drug like??

				OMFG Foxy (5-MEO-DiPT) is the best shit I have ever had that went with sex. Not only does it make you feel like your body is going to orgasm from every touch, but when you thrust it sends tingles all over your body like you just shot up some good meth. It makes your partner look like they are glowing with beauty. The girl I was with was already good looking but this intensified to where she looked like a Greek Goddess, and when I say glowing I mean it literally it looked like she had this unwordly glow of absolute perfection. I fucked the whole night long, and it made me such an animal! I was doing and saying things I never thought I would say, it totally unleashed any inhibition I had in me. I probably got off in her at least 5 or 6 times and the orgasm is so powerful you feel like it can&#039;t get any better or you might just pass out.<br /><br />To anyone who thinks I am exaggerating I am not at all if anything this is an understatement. I don&#039;t exaggerate you can look at my reviews I give on here. Hands down the best sexual experience and 2nd best experience of my life! It makes the elixir of sex meth look like a boner pill.

				It produces mild visual and mild to heavy audial distortions. The room seems like it is full of smoke sometimes and music sounds so damn good (I sat and played music on my cell phone and rubbed the phone around my head from side to side because it would make me tingle down my neck and shiver) the music transferred over to a physical feeling.<br /><br />I first did this drug under the impression it was an MDMA pressed pill because my friend would get thousands of them and I never had ecstasy, and I was like wow this shit is as good as they say it is. Well, thanks to old pill reports I found out it was a 5-MEO-DiPT in there and nothing else. <br /><br />Yes, girls respond just the same to it. She loved it and just kept begging me to make out with her and touch her. I gave it to a different girl too, one I had just met about 2 hours before that at my friends house and about an hour after she took it, and a little bit of kissing her on the neck and touching her inner thighs she just couldn&#039;t take it anymore and pulled me to the bedroom. <br /><br />

It&#039;s been getting to the point where I forget what I took on what day but I&#039;m nearly sure I&#039;m good enough to enjoy some 25x-NBOMe. If one doesn&#039;t work I&#039;ll take another, if that still doesn&#039;t do the job I&#039;ll try a different letter, if that doesn&#039;t work I&#039;m positive my tolerance to DOC is low.....I wonder if my 25i usage will effect a 2C-E trip because I can always resort to that if the DOC doesn&#039;t satisfy me.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m saving up to buy myself a few special weekends in advance. I want a couple of grams of molly, an ounce of shrooms, and ounce of bud, a half ounce of hash, an eighth of coke, a gram of K, a ten-strip of lucy, a gram of DMT,&nbsp; 100mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, 100mg of 4-AcO-DMT, 500mg of Mescaline, 100mg 2C-B;C;E, 500mg MXE and I should be good for the rest of the year and can take a break from the road. Anything else worthy to stock up? :D<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of going straight until I&#039;ve saved enough to purchase it all, after I&#039;ve finished off my current stash that is. ;)

				Its a bit like mdma, same sort of body high and you feel a bit of love, but doesnt have the same magic or &#039;openness&#039;. It also has euphoria that&#039;s a bit like bing and apparently its a bit like speed as well. If you take it at a party you will become a gurning, dancing, euphioic mess but you can&#039;t help but love it.<br />its pretty addictive to say the least as well, once you have a line its hard to refuse another one, but i can sit here with it in the draw next to me and be able not to want any. :)

				yeah i seem to find it way more easy to talk about deep and emotional things on MDMA rather than Meph, but i still feel that bond. Its hard to describe, I guess on Meph you literally say whatever you&#039;re thinking at the time and its very chatty. Very fun as well :)&nbsp;

				This is one of those days where slitting my wrists seems so appealing, god I feel like I&#039;ve been dying so very slowly.. only fate is cruel enough to give me a tiny morsel of hope every passing day as if to keep me rotting that much longer. Tired.. so tired.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not even the slightest bit depressed, truthfully I&#039;ll admit I&#039;m suspended in a state of compete apathy. Curious.. how strange is it to crave utter silence while the rest of the world can&#039;t seem to shut up? Normality has been obscured by the bizarre and I can&#039;t differentiate between the two, the mundane fill me with disgust, I dream of escaping this cesspool and cleansing my reality from the vermin known as humans. I don&#039;t feel right, so please excuse my musings.

Whatever you do, do not boil up on your own, please communicate with people around you if poss and certainly vent here if ya feeling this way and no-one else to chat to around you....<br /><br />I hope things straighten out for you man....Whatever your issues.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Couldn&#039;t of said it any better G. Give the drugs, chemicals and herbs a break for a while and talk to your friends, family, partner whoever IRL about your problems, it really helps and will lift you back up, i promise. We&#039;re all here if you need any advice I&#039;m sure, but nothing beats a good heart to heart in person. Go out and doing something you&#039;ll enjoy,&nbsp; running, swimming, road trip with someone who cares about you, anything which will take your mind anyway from your problems that isn&#039;t drugs. A break from them will do you the world of good. <br />Hope you feel better soon though, keep us all updated on how you&#039;re getting along. :)

				Literally I done over 50 of the fuckers (takes my sales to over 400 now :D) and then this fuck-face just decides to order 1 single gram of Meph. Ballache. <br /><br />Also because of our special little group here when the new real pre-ban Meph lands at the end of this month I&#039;ve decided that Team Old Spice gets first dibs on samples because I flaked on the last lot a bit. This time you all get first dibs and it&#039;s both for the Meph and the Ket. You can all have 1 sample of each. :)<br /><br />Consider yourself lucky, the HNMR/HPLC analysis are giving purity readouts for both products at 99.9999r% purity, this shit is quite literally as good as it can be.

				Any of you guys know the best drug for weight loss? I was thinking of Amphetamines, but don&#039;t fancy going to the Gym whilst I&#039;m speeding my bollocks off. Might just get some Ephedrine, bit weaker than Speed and it should still have some appetite suppressing properties but without the high.<br /><br />And I haven&#039;t had access to the internet mate. Back now though, working on my weight, its killing me! Working on me muscles as well, those Tricep exercises are fucking difficult lol.<br /><br />I&#039;m buzzing after this Gym, plus 1 to all of you! (If I can) Loooooving it.

				Ephedrine. Its easy to get and it&#039;s more an appetite suppressant rather than an Amphetamine-speed buzz.

				Yeah, I&#039;ll go for that. Looking at this thing called the ECA stack (Ephedrine, Caffeine, and Aspirin). Sounds good, joining Fag Ends as well lol.

If my friend sells under 50% purity for £50 a half then he can sell raw for £100 a gram and people WILL pay it if he let them see the proof of the pudding. He&#039;s just pulling the old trick of letting you try the gold-dust and then will cut it when you come back for more. All in all, a typical Dave ploy is being initiated, don&#039;t get sucked in.

The difference is that MDA is speedy and more psychedelic but has less roll and a different kind of empathy, MDMA is more roll, less psychedelic and more euphoric and love-giving. <br /><br />They are very similar but at the same time very different. The are like the Yin to the other ones Yang. :) Taken in combination you get the full spectrum of MDxx which is a phenomenal experience. <br /><br />I tried to bring MDA out ages ago when I first got here but we couldn&#039;t make it work but now we have got the facilities to do it so whilst it isn&#039;t 100% yet you&#039;ll see me bringing out my own MDMA and MDA in the near future. <br /><br />Explanation + Advertising = Win

				Ok little bit of an update on my Blow buffet delivery. C63AMG&#039;s arrived within 2 and a half days of making the order, gotta say I was fucking impressed with the speed of that. The order was very slightly underweight but I am not really too fussed about that. Product came all powder which made me quite skeptical at first but then when I smelled it it has the smell of PVA which indicates it being washed. Only thing that is odd is that the powder is quite fluffy. The high is VERY clean, I would say it&#039;s cleaner than Pfands and the onset is instant. Will be testing the purity a bit later on and will report back. <br /><br />So far, very happy with C63AMG.

				cool man, might have to have a dabble. though if it stinks of acetone it&#039;s not been dried properly - it shouldn&#039;t smell of anything, and if it&#039;s ONLY an acetone wash it will still have a faint typical coke smell.

				Well when I&#039;m playing with IRL friends, we usually stay out of party chat because we like to talk to the other people on the team, however, COD is flooded with screaming 8 year olds that everyone fucks with until their mommy or daddy come on and try to bitch us out for fucking with them. That&#039;s when you tell them they&#039;re horrible parents and are totally irresponsible and shouldn&#039;t be letting their kid play with adults :P.

				Whatsuppzz ladies, hows it? Much going on? Thought I&#039;d share a story..<br />MrFireUk&#039;s bing is lethal, on Saturday night I went through a quarter gram of it and a quarter gram of meph in less than an hour. Seeing as I&#039;ve never really done proper, strong bing before thats a hell of a lot for me. All i can remember doing is coming onto those forums on my mates computer, deciding that i was hungry (wtf?!) which resulted in me attempting to eat an out of date sandwich, which made me gag, ending with me projectile vomiting all over my mates kitchen floor, he wasn&#039;t too happy if I&#039;m honest. ;) I also had the worst comedown I&#039;ve ever experienced in my whole life&nbsp; ::)<br />Yep, bing + meph is fucking good, but a combination that needs to be treated with respect lol. <br />Anyways, my blue defqons came today which I&#039;m happy about as I&#039;m leaving for a festival tomorrow :)

				yeah i used to be like that, couldn&#039;t go a day without a joint - when i was selling it i used to be smoking about a henry a day, but these days i can take it or leave it - been like that for a couple of years now. its mainly when i&#039;m on the playstation that i miss it - can just zone out on it if i&#039;m stoned, get bored of it a lot quicker if i&#039;m sober, and i&#039;m just shit on it when i&#039;m drunk so i don&#039;t bother with it at all.<br /><br />getting it off pureogkush mate, after a couple of failed euro deliveries started shitting it a bit about customs, so thought i&#039;d stay safe and go domestic. now i&#039;m just thinking lebouef was just a bit of a muppet in his sending abilities and it never left the country, well that and the fucker couldn&#039;t produce a tracking number when it didn&#039;t turn up, and i&#039;m not sure about AfterHour sending his bit either because he couldn&#039;t give us a tracking number either

				I never tried his coke but I used him for H several times and is always rapid as fuck! I&#039;m waiting on some freebase coke from him now tho as part of my resolution for the shit H he sent me so excited to get my hands on it!! Is it fairly easy to convert freebase to HCL? I&#039;ve never had freebase before but would be interesting to convert half of it back to HCL to get a pure product to sniff!? Get the full cocaine experience!! :) I love cocaine joints.....<br /><br />I&#039;m rolling with C63 again then by the look of it! HCL for the win!! I&#039;m a bit pissed I didn&#039;t just ask for proper coke now when he offered that! doh!! ;D ;D

				On principle it&#039;s easy to convert the freebase to the hydrochloride salt but it can be tricky the first couple of times. If you overdo it it doesn&#039;t knacker the Blow it just makes it extremely hard and crystalline so it&#039;s quite literally like crushing stones. It wont hurt the buzz or anything, just make be a bit sharper on the conk and it&#039;s harder to crush. There are guides on how to do it on the net, just Google it. :)

				Seriously guys I dunno why you bother shopping around like you do. I mean Christ on a bike with a pack of hobnobs and a hand-grenade I basically do the research for you lol. C63 is the one at the moment believe me, also the way he ships is stupidly stealthy.

				I got a friend who does glass blowing, it&#039;s pretty cool, just very expensive to get all the equipment.<br /><br />Exactly, I can be stoned anywhere at anytime and be 100% a-ok :). I just hate the hangover I get with LSD, my tolerance for drugs is very low and LSD just hits me too hard. nbomes are cool but it&#039;s iffy on what I&#039;m doing. Took 25i, went out to get some dinner with the fam, hit me right as I got my food. My brother asked my my pupils were so dilated and I was like &quot;dude....idk this sandwich is good as shit though&quot; lol. Pretty obvious I was fucked up

				Yeah you know this one off CS wasn&#039;t as good as the last one...Not as good euphoria, but still nice once I washed it. I guess thats why it was cheaper this time!!!

Italiano looks sick but it is fuckin expensive, tho if its that sick you don&#039;t mind so much do ya!<br /><br />I like the effects from the JWH&#039;s but I don&#039;t really like doing it as when I vape it on foil it reminds me of doing smack, which I don&#039;t want, and it&#039;s flavourless in joints and as such is soooo much less pleasurable than smoking some good ol cheezy dank buds!! :)<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for my holiday this month.....

				Have fun G Dawg!<br /><br />Hey Lim I had some interesting Meth today. It was without a doubt the best I have ever had as far as strength. And finally discovered the euphoric meth effects that has been spoken about. While in Australia to cut coke with meth would be economically stupid. I believe the same applies in EU. I mean the price of meth is higher than coke. So it doesn&#039;t really make sense. But cut with dried speed paste is a distinct reality. <br />When you next receive you coke order. Wash a gram with chloroform. And let me know what comes back? Meth in EU no. Speed is a different story.

				Hey man, well the racemic one is still sweet too and I find it great to compliment MD or 2C-B or both!! ;) Try Ivory, I never used him but I&#039;m going to give him a shout soon and I know Lim raves about him along with many other members...Also Googleyed I think does K and I had a great bag of 2C-B off him. Don&#039;t worry about K, just respect it!!! You need to start small then work up, just so you get a feel for your tolerance as it can be a bit nasty in a K-Hole if you don&#039;t know what to expect and batches can vary in potency!!! Lim had some good MXE I bought off him and it lasted me bloody ages!! Like 2-3 months on just half a gram!! You only need one or two lines of that stuff and the lines are fairly small, like 60-80mg, but I prefer the buzz off K myself....

				EZ DK! I know I was kind of hoping that package of H &amp; Freebase would of arrived on Saturday but didn&#039;t and was pissed as I wanted it for Monday, but then I thought ahhhhh it&#039;ll come today tho for sure so I&#039;ll hit that bit of crystal last night and be good to smoke the H today....Nahhhh no such luck! This gear I got local is shit too as it runs with loads of black residue on the trails and is harsh as fuck to smoke. I&#039;m done with H#3 if this gear off C63 is not up to much.....It&#039;s almost a 50/50 gamble whether you get good stuff or not, whereas H#4 seems to get great reviews across the board if legit product. What is it with H#3 in the last few years!!?? Shit in a can!!

Don&#039;t worry about K, just respect it!!! You need to start small then work up, just so you get a feel for your tolerance as it can be a bit nasty in a K-Hole if you don&#039;t know what to expect and batches can vary in potency!!! Lim had some good MXE I bought off him and it lasted me bloody ages!! Like 2-3 months on just half a gram!! You only need one or two lines of that stuff and the lines are fairly small, like 60-80mg, but I prefer the buzz off K myself....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey GDAAWWG, cheers for the reply :) Yeah i was looking at Ivory because his MDMA is just the bomb. But he seems rather expensive, I think i&#039;ll go ahead and purchase some from ether him or googleeyed when my coins are in my account again though! Yeah i&#039;ll probably start off by railing 20/30mg&#039;s and then see how i feel. I&#039;m deferentially going to start with Ket though, if I like it I may move on to MXE as just about everyone prefers ket. I heard the buzz from Ket is like a nitrous balloon? if so I think I&#039;m gunna fucking love it, lol.

				EZ guys!

				Yeah I did live in Sydney for a while about 10 years ago and had planned to settle there with my girlfriend at the time who was from NZ, I&#039;d been with her for 3 years and her UK visa ran out so had to leave &amp; I went to live with her out there, but we moved to Sydney after a short spell in Brisbane &amp; NZ. I do like oz tho to be fair! Never saw too much of Melbourne but did go to the city centre for a day and night in transit just to have a quick look about. But me n her went a bit pear shaped after a time and so I ended up leaving her and coming back to the UK.....I loved living in a warm climate!! Soooo much better!! Can&#039;t wait to leave England next year!

				gtg, I really REALLY wish I could, but I&#039;d rather keep my job ;).<br /><br />moksha, Not really, it was -close- but some looked like they had more product than others. It looked like he laid them in a tray and just poured the solution over them and let dry. Personally, I&#039;m a fan of using a dropper to evenly dose, but that&#039;s a bitch and a half so I don&#039;t blame him in the slightest. Never had foxy&#039;s blotters, never was a bought bulk tabs, didn&#039;t see the point really cause of the tolerance issues (which doesn&#039;t seem to effect me for some reason lol...). Sounds like fun though mok!<br /><br />Do it, do it, do it, do it.....it&#039;s easy. You don&#039;t even have to install pidgin if you already have an irc client, or if you want you can just download the portable version, all works the same. Was talkin to shiz last night on it :P.

				Haha nice Gnomes|!! Old Spice Music....Our signature theme tune!! LOL<br /><br />Well I never, a vendor asking you to send cash in the post turned out to be a scammer?? Neverrrr?? It&#039;s why I never used him....Vlad said that he had an arrangement with a couple of UK vendors where they sent him coins and he sent out a wad of cash in the post to the vendor. I wondered as Lim chatted to him a bit if Lim was one of those vendors Vlad was serving.....I&#039;ll have a look at that thread about it all now....<br /><br />Nice one Georgey! Me neither Kryptoz.....&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Oh my I have a really bad feeling about this whole Vlad1m1r thing, venders and admins seem to be disappearing by the day now and its pretty concerning, we need Lim back! When I say &#039;Its hard to trust people on this site&#039; I mean venders, even the reputable ones like Vlad was. Not you guys, you are legends ;) <br /><br />And yeah I won tickets to see Deadmau5. haha fairs kryptoz, I&#039;m very much into his music, electronic music being my favorite genre so yeah I&#039;m shocked I actually won tickets as I&#039;ve wanted to see him live for a very long time lol! <br /><br />LOL Knomo +1 for that ;D

				Ah yes I know exactly what you mean they are pretty annoying, I also hate the way it glamorizes the use of drugs in some ways. Every time I go to a electronic gig there always young kids trying to sell me or off there faces on &#039;fkin gr8 E pills m8!!&#039;, which probably just contains a toxic mix of nasty RC&#039;s. But to be fair to them, electronic music does sound so much better when you&#039;re on real MDMA.&nbsp; ::) I know, thanks man!<br /><br />By the way does anyone know how long Limetless is going on holiday for?

I guess sending cash in the post was gonna end badly to Vlad and as he is getting way morre biz after the sango fuck up....Guess he just saw a chance, but he aint too smart either by the sound of it....The name of his SR handle was basically his real name, n peeps found loads of junk incl his FB page just from the name and 10 mins on Google!! haha Glad I never let him convince me to send him cash in the post!!!

				yeah just work ya way up bruv....just dont nail a big coke like line!! more like half a coke sized line maybe...but I think 20mg is good to start, but id bump it up to atleast 60mg quite quickly if ur feeling ok off the 20, do it in 20&#039;s again till 60, then you will know how you can handle it and go for ya life!! It lasts an hour or two each dose/line kinda thing...I like it man....

				Busy as well kryptoz, busy day indeed. My downstem broke yesterday which bummed me out so I haven&#039;t even bothered to smoke at all today, but at least this means I get to take a trip down to my favorite head shop tomorrow! I think I&#039;m just going to buy a new bong altogether while I&#039;m there. ^-^<br /><br />Anyways.. I&#039;ve got my shopping list nearly all figured out but need advice on what to spend my final fifty or so bucks (about £30+ I guess). So far I&#039;m getting a few grams of MDMA, half ounce of Strawberry Kush and another of Afghan Kush, half ounce of psilocybin mushrooms, some edibles, and that&#039;s it so far.<br /><br />I still have plenty of 2C-E, 25i-NBOMe, DOC, LSD, DMT, MXE, Ketamine, and speed but I want something new. Any psychedelics I&#039;m missing out on? I&#039;m tempted to go for some 2C-B or maybe give 25d-NBOMe a shot. It would be nice to have something without any tolerance issues with my current stash though so I&#039;m open to suggestions. :))

Good choice on the MDA, banging shit! Still got a few doses left but I reckon it&#039;s best took with MDMA at same time.<br /><br />Gotta get my shopping list together! ;) Won&#039;t be as big a one as last time though...Still got loads of shit left, just trying to get stockpiles like Gazza at the moment...Dr. G and his prescriptions&nbsp; :P ;D

As far as I&#039;ve read he recommended using vlads services, so everyone&#039;s calling him out to &#039;own up&#039; to something? Every fucker that used vlads service before he went rogue recommended him, so why is lim getting called out? Am I missing something? <br /><br />Some threads of apparently vlad and lim talking about money laundering were deleted - WTF?

				I know they&#039;re a bunch of tools....I think we&#039;d know if Lim was several people from the way he talked to us here....I dunno, I guess you never really know but I have no reason to suspect Lim is Vlad also at all....I didn&#039;t realize Lim was goin away for so long but he has no active listings and used escrow so no scamming there, Guru has been given deleting powers too now so I&#039;m guessing it may of been him who deleted any posts if they did get deleted or one of the other mods....Nomad or someone.<br /><br />RD have you bought any coke lately? I&#039;m looking to buy but I&#039;m not going with that Italiano as its just too expensive for me even if it is the pengest shit out there...It fucking should be at that price!! I&#039;m thinking Northern Dancer as first order can be in escrow tho you must FE after the first buy.

				Last 3 guys I bought off was Afterhour, pureogkush and Chang. Tried getting a bit more off ah cos that was pretty good but ended up going to resolution, got a refund of kush cos it was pretty lame, and changs out of stock, which is a shame cos his gear was the best IMO, and the quickest.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t FE mate, not for anybody. <br /><br />That italiano has some good reviews but yeah - well expensive. I PMd Chang to see what&#039;s going on and he&#039;s hoping for this week so think im gonna hold out for him. TBH I&#039;m in no rush after last weekend

				I know yeah, I&#039;m not FE&#039;ing it&#039;s OK to go escrow on first order and will only order this once,&nbsp; people are ravin about his stuff at the mo (ND) Dutchaan is back but might try his MDMA.<br /><br />FrankMatthews also looks to have good stuff, I don&#039;t get the privnote thing though...Surely if someone can de-cypher an SR msg then they can access the privnote msg as they would get the link rendering it pointless and may as well of just put ya address over SR raw.....Anyone clear that up or is that correct?

				Well c63&#039;s latest batch has been slammed in the c vendors thread, n I saw dutchie was back but his last page of feedback is not good at all, so I&#039;d hold out for more recent feedback before I give him a shot. The privnotes are apparently destroyed the moment someone first accesses the link. I don&#039;t know if the site backs it up to help plod out if required, but they claim not to. Think id still prefer that over leaving the addy clear text

It takes 2 secs!! LOL Yeah I was gonna go with C63 after Lims last lot but fucked if I&#039;m going to him at mo as I still aint received my re-ship of that whack H I got that he promised, I PM&#039;d him asking when he sent it but no response and that was days ago now....Also the new reviews are sounding awful!

As its almost impossible to get sleep on MXE... <br /><br />It sends you of your fucking cake lol. Everything seemed smaller, and in a way unreal.

				I always go with a thinner line, just because I never feel it going up that way, and if it were to be absorbed I&#039;d think doing small amounts at a time that could be absorbed near-instantly would be better then having giant clumps sitting in your nose for a minute :P.

				my lines are pretty thin, and maybe only 2 inches long - if the cokes that good you don&#039;t need any more than that, so it would just be a waste - if it clumps up in your nose you&#039;re absorbing it really slowly, like a drip feed sort of thing. you obviously want as much to hit you as quick as possible so ideally you shouldn&#039;t snort if your nose is too dry either - its the mucus in the nose that turns the powder into a solution which makes it absorb quickest, so before you do a line, once you&#039;ve blown your nose use a saline spray and then do your line.&nbsp; that also does least damage because it&#039;s the fine powder particles that end up cutting through the skin in your nose, if it&#039;s already turned into a solution there&#039;s nothing hard to cut your nose up.<br /><br />just call me Dr. Duke ;)

				Lets think about this logically for a minute, she&#039;s a whore IRL, she&#039;s uploaded pictures of herself (including n00dz) and starts an argument with anyone with any sort of itellegance.<br />All of these activities shows she fucking loves the attention, she craves it, wether its good or bad. <br />This is probably due to some sort of disruptive childhood.

				The thing that gets me is she actually thinks she has an argument. ???<br /><br />So lims best seller is jw19 or whatever the fuck it&#039;s called, and he sells it at a huge markup - fair play to the bastard, it&#039;s not his fault there are complete muppets that don&#039;t know how to use google that are paying for it! <br /><br />And he copied and pasted a description from a clear web site? Well It saves the fucker having to think of and then type up a description, and she&#039;s found the motor on a clear web site? OH NO - I&#039;ve seen the exact same image on at least 5 different sites.<br /><br />Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. I suppose he&#039;s quite lucky this particular one doesn&#039;t have the intelligence to be vicious with it. I&#039;m looking forward to him destroying her lack of logic, then hopefully after that she&#039;ll just fade into the background because people stop replying to her bullshit posts

				Yeah I will mate, no idea what to expect though, never done ket before lol. :) <br />I just tried to look at 1 gram listing to check the reviews though, but he&#039;s taken it down ??? hopefully he&#039;s just restocking...<br />Oh also some kind advice for you meph heads, drop ~500mg of L-Arginine about an hour before you start taking the meph and then again the day after, or when you decide to stop.. It really helps with the Vaso-Constriction, I no longer get pin and needles or white extremities after using a lot of Meph. :)<br />Although I&#039;m giving Meph and coke a break for a couple months now, need to get some of the magic back. So no one let me buy any for at least 2 months lol!&nbsp;

				Heres what I wrote earlier in regards to the K: &quot;had some very interesting dance moves going on ;). I had ~15mg followed by another 15mg about 10minutes later. For about the first 2 minutes I didn&#039;t really like it, but then I let it happen and it just made me feel really nice and happy lol (like being drunk but a lot nicer). Had some very abstract/inspiring thoughts but I can&#039;t remember what they where :-\ very weird, eyes also starting moving slow and they felt heavy. Still got a nice afterglow going on now, 3 hours after I railed!

Kinda scary and I do like to be in control of my actions somewhat when taking substances or i start to panic. But who knows, I&#039;ll have a bit more experience with it before I decide. :) Ah man, a kitty flip sounds really nice! happy birthday for next week bro!

You never answered me about DOB as I&#039;m waiting on that but was asking what you thought of it??<br /><br />I&#039;m working up to getting as much of an arsenal as you man....I just want everything!!! My Coke off Northern Dancer just finally went into transit overnight....<br /><br />When all this comes through I will have, also in no particular order: 2g Cocaine, 1.5g Heroin, 1g freebase coke, MDA, MDMA, Ketamine, 4-ACO-DMT, NN-DMT, DOB, 25i &amp; c NBOMe&#039;s, Methamphetamine, LSD, 2C-B, Buds, Codeine &amp; Benzo&#039;s......I ran out of a few drugs which I will restock on soon but others I need to try, and next on my list are Mescaline, 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-MiPT/DiPT, GHB, THC Wax/Budder.....and my 5g slab of Moroccan hash, though I&#039;ve smoked bare hash in the past, not had any for years!! G Dawg used to sell real nice Pollens so looking forward to that!.....6 months on and still like a kid in a sweetshop!!&nbsp; ;D ;D 8)<br /><br />Mephedrone is euphoric but I think coke is more so....Plus I much much much prefer Cocaine to the Drone.

				Hmm, really weird stim pentedrone is, I was able to fall asleep on it no problem, and eat too. The numbing is near exactly like cocaine, and it kinda feels like shitty low-grade quality coke, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if someone tried to cut actual coke with this, as most people wouldn&#039;t even notice o.O. None the less, at the prices, I like it :). Still isn&#039;t real coke, but it&#039;s better then buying street shit cut with who-knows-what!<br /><br />Also, I just died of laughter on that TT thread lol.

				Careful if you wanna take the plunge with h moks mate, seriously get the smallest amount possible and make sure you don&#039;t get any more. It&#039;s too nice if you know what I mean. I&#039;d say give coke a go first mate, people say its addictive but that&#039;s only true if you got it on tap. They&#039;re all different though mate - k is nothing like coke n smack and likewise with the other 2. Depends what you want out of it really - you just want to try it sat at home go for h or k, you wanna go out and party it&#039;s defo coke.<br /><br />I&#039;ve given up reading that thread, it&#039;s the same fucking thing posted to every reply, even when the reply proved it wrong. That punkstoners getting on my tits as well, he&#039;s obviously missed the saga of getting TT to try to anonymise herself, for her own fucking safety I might add, and&nbsp; just seems to want to row for the fuck of it.

				LoveUnderWill I think is the vendor, Gonzo was backing him and was talking to the vendor via IRC. He was handing out 250mg samples so I said why not, I don&#039;t mind being a guinea pig for things like this, since I know my limits compared to everyone else. I take half the normal doses usually, so I know what to expect, etc. I&#039;d recommend trying it, since I know you&#039;ve done coke. It has many similarities, but mostly that numbing. I do really like it. Good alternative for me atl least, I can&#039;t afford coke right now :(.

				Sorry to hear that mate =/. I&#039;ve never tried oxy, but I&#039;ve read posts claiming its more euphoric than H. I wouldn&#039;t have described H as euphoric TBH, more of a &#039;blissful&#039; feeling. I felt like it was just me and the H, I needed no one else, just the H... Someone could have pointed a gun at me and I&#039;d have remained completely chilled out. <br /><br />Is that what oxy feels like? How are you all anyway? :)

Rough times :-\.<br /><br />I&#039;m doing pretty well, just workin on some stuff for work while I&#039;m on this pent, hbu?

				On a 1-10 scale for a stim, around a 7-8. You can eat while on it, you don&#039;t get stim dick, you don&#039;t get edgy, and you do get euphoria. And at 30 USD / Gram, it&#039;s pretty cheap. I got 250mg as a sample, and I&#039;ve barely put a dent in it. ;D.

				Comparing H to Codeine is probably like comparing Megan Fox to Susan Boyle lol :P. But I can&#039;t say for sure, as the only time I&#039;ve had codeine was when I took Co-Codamol tabs for a hangover :).<br /><br />It&#039;s fucking nice though, I did throw up once... But it felt nice, well not nice, but it was like a real relief once I threw up... Made me feel even better :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m putting this, but speaking of 1-10 scales I&#039;ll list what I&#039;ve tried and my rating out of 10. In order.<br /><br />Mephedrone - 10/10 - well tbh, of the fucking scales! my personal favourite. No need to explain this one :P<br /><br />Coke - 9/10 but only good quality coke. (Dutchaanbod&#039;s coke is amazing). Makes me feel like superman, makes me pretty talkative (but not as much as Meph or Speed)<br /><br />MD 9/10 - It&#039;s nice, but the euphoria from MD is nowhere near that of Drone though. However the peace and love I feel for the world is unique to MD. Drone makes me feel things are AMAZING. but not beautiful.<br /><br />H 8/10 - Would rate a 10, but I&#039;m a Stim man... Plus I can see an addiction forming quite easily.<br /><br />LSD 8/10 - As nice as it was, it lasted too long for my liking and the euphoria felt too natural.. Felt like I was &#039;earning&#039; my euphoria as appose to the drug inducing it. But when the euphoria did hit me, it was the most beautiful feeling I&#039;ve ever had. <br /><br />Meth 8/10. Very nice, I felt like fucking GOD, I felt like I could go outside and throw my house as far as pluto! I felt so powerful. If it wasn&#039;t for the long comedown, this would have been good. I then bumped some H shortly afterwards. (which is when you all thought I had died lol)<br /><br />2c-b 7/10, Would rate an 8, but I fucking snorted it didn&#039;t I - Heavy body load, and my sinuses felt like they were on fire. - after that, I had some nice visuals, and a nice trip, that didn&#039;t last too long. Oh and its awesome for sexual enhancement ;).<br /><br />M1 - 7/10, now this gave me the BEST afterglow I&#039;ve ever had. The high itself was like a weakened MD roll. but it had its own unique properties. I felt like a little kid again, and my soul felt like it had been given METH<br /><br />Ket and MXE 6/10. Both nice drugs, but not too much euphoria, (not stim like euphoria anyway) good if you want to be off your fucking cake though. I prefer Ket, as it doesn&#039;t last as long so you have more control of how long you want to be high. ket is a big BANG, mxe is like radioactive material, creeps up on you, but in the end you fucking know about it.<br /><br />Weed - 3/10 lol. Hate it, nice with MD and its ok with Ket. On its own it makes me feel anxious and paranoid. I wouldn&#039;t mind so much if the &#039;high&#039; was worth the side effects. but tbh its not, its shit.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s it... I&#039;ve tried a few other things but can&#039;t think of them of the top of my head.<br /><br /><br />OH <br /><br />Alcohol, 6/10 I like my booze, but I hate the hangover. And I ALWAYS wake up dying for some water in the middle of the night, then can&#039;t get back sleep :/.<br /><br />Speed - 7/10, its very nice but like Meth, I get a long shit comedown and can&#039;t sleep/eat properly for fucking ages.<br /><br />Anyway I was bored lol. Had to write something constructive :). When I can post this without the &#039;unable to connect&#039; I&#039;ll be happy.

				o: I could never rate Alc higher than weed, even though it doesn&#039;t make you trip or active, it&#039;s one of the most relaxing things ever. Plus I have somewhat of a passion for weed ::). I like the smells, strains, growing, history, etc etc etc.

Imagine how messy it would be, fuck me! If only it could happen..&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />Soll, yeah i had 120mg of codeine and i was feeling nice! Not a care in the world, and blissful! Probably has nothing on H though! <br />Thats a good scale bro, I&#039;d put MDMA above Meph though, you just can&#039;t beat it imo! But if i was going to a party with some strangers there and some loud fucking music then i&#039;d probably choose my main drug to be meph over MDMA, if i was having a small gathering of close friends and my favorite songs than my main drug of choice would be MDMA. I seem to be more satisfied on MDMA rather than Meph I believe :) also MDMA + 2c-b is fucking amazing. <br />Really wanna try LSD + shrooms soon though, just gotta pick a good time! <br />Weed is alright, although I&#039;ve cut down smoking that a lot now, feel much &#039;clearer&#039; for it. weed is very nice to combo with certain drugs though :) <br />

Or he&#039;s getting a lot of fap-material, I guess? I wouldn&#039;t have a problem if he&#039;d actually accept all of the many logical points against Social, but... no, he&#039;s just a lapdog or a shill, sadly.<br /><br />It&#039;s real easy to figure out, too. Anyone who is as concerned as he is for the safety of the Road, and the &quot;dangers Limetless creates&quot; should be equally opposed to Social, who has done far more harm than good, even IF she is right about Lim. So the resulting possibilities can be broken down into a few brief categories, none of which include any kind of love for the Road itself. Only a whole pile of ulterior motives.

				I actually said earlier in the thread if punk isn&#039;t Social (don&#039;t think so, he acts even more retarded), then he&#039;s probably getting e-pussy lol. <br /><br />Truth is, I don&#039;t care if lim doesn&#039;t come back, he was a cool guy to talk to, but besides that I really don&#039;t care one way or the other ::). Didn&#039;t buy from him, and it&#039;s not really my problem. The only reason social even made that thread was because she saw the vlad post, saw someone else mentioned lim, and decided to use it to her advantage, which is exactly how a girl would handle that sort of thing. Seeing as how she was butthurt lim didn&#039;t like her.<br /><br />If social is LE, no surprise. If social is just a hoe who&#039;s pissed off at lim, no surprise. If lim doesn&#039;t come back, no surprise. I don&#039;t see what the big deal is really. o.O.

				Hey so... you guys seem smart and all, figure I&#039;ll ask you folks.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some DMT I&#039;ve been too much of a pussy to touch, just yet. What&#039;s holding me back is mostly a fear of the nausea. Everything else, I can deal with. But not nausea.<br /><br />So, in your experiences, if you&#039;ve got it, what&#039;s the best way to counter nausea when smoking DMT?

				I&#039;ve been wishing I had changa, instead. I&#039;ve actually considered trying to get it into some cannabis, failing that.

				howdy ho pant sniffers :P wa gwarn? whens that fuck bag lim back then? i got me popcorn all ready for the fallout. although once he&#039;s finished laughing i doubt he&#039;ll get any more sense out of that psychopathic bitch than the rest of us. i still don&#039;t buy that she&#039;s old bill - seriously, if she was and this was all a tactic to turn everybody against lim, why doesn&#039;t she have any valid arguments? every point she had has gone down in flames and she still carries on like she&#039;s captain fucking know-it-all with the same points - surely even the dumbest cop would have tried a different angle by now. and then there&#039;s the escort site - there&#039;s no way plod take on ex whores, so at most she&#039;s a narc. and a fucking schizo one at that. socialbombshell? more like social fucking leper.<br /><br />that punkst0ner&#039;s just a muppet as well - he just doesn&#039;t like lim and he&#039;s willing to back anybody trying to put the fucker down. i bet if/when kmf starts up with his cheese pizza threads again punkst0ner will be backing him up just because lim (and anyone else who isn&#039;t a kiddy fiddler, but that&#039;s not the point) puts him down. <br /><br />ginger ale is fucking rank you sick bastards :P&nbsp; never done DMT either, is that supposed to be like K but a bit more trippy?<br /><br />yeah mosh - k/c is by far the lesser of the evils! man you&#039;re gonna love your first line of charlie. loving the list sol man, although i can&#039;t believe you rate meph that highly? here&#039;s mine<br /><br />mandy/E or pure washed coke - 10<br />good coke - 9<br />smack - 8<br />shrooms - 7<br />k or booze or valium - 6<br />drone or puff (minus the paranoia) - 5<br />lucy - 3<br /><br />can&#039;t think of what else i&#039;ve done. oh yeah<br /><br />2c-b - -5 (minus)<br />shit coke - -8<br /><br />booze doesn&#039;t really figure into it because i NEED a drink if i&#039;m tooting, likewise i need to smoke pot if i&#039;m rolling. not really into psychs - my brains just too fucked up for me to want to explore it that much<br /><br />comparing co-codamol to heroin is like comparing carlsberg (3.8% - yes i am quite sad knowing that) to whiskey<br /><br />and i&#039;m with you gaz - i&#039;ll happily ignore those retards once lims had a pop at them. saying that i&#039;m ignoring them already, only bother going in if i fancy a row :)<br />

				Duthcaanbod&#039;s coke is NICE. Loved it. Ahh RD/Mok nice to see your list fellas! <br /><br />It&#039;s funny how we all have completely different opinions on how good a drug is. For me MD is not stimulating or euphoric enough to make a 10. Meph is much more stimulating/euphoric IMO.<br /><br />Ahh Carlgberg 3.8% Carling 4% Strongbow 5.3% Magners (Bottled) 4.5%. Budweiser (Bottled) 5%. Think I love my drink a little too much&nbsp; ::). <br /><br />Anyway how&#039;s everyone? RD you say you get the tuesday blues from MD, what does it feel like? All I feel is a little more tired the next day. I don&#039;t get bad comedowns.. maybe that&#039;s because I&#039;ve only done it 10 times or so.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				i get the proper hump on suicide tuesdays, proper down and just no inclination to do anything. depending on how much md i caned it can get suicidal. it&#039;s got the point where i&#039;ve split up with the mrs before. it&#039;s just depression on a grand scale really. emotions are all over the shop as well - watching disney films has brought a tear to my eye after a big session

				and yeah - took me a good 6 months of caning it every weekend (friday and saturday) before i started getting comedowns that included suicide tuesdays, so you should be ok if you just do it sparingly. i&#039;m just an idiot when i find something i like doing - i fucking cane the arse out of it

				Fuck me that sounds bad. Sounds like a major depressive episode! Which does make sense, since MD releases all your serotonin. Still, if you&#039;re having a fucking good weekend bashing it out, its probably worth it! <br /><br />You ever tried speed RD? That gives me the longest comedowns, sat up all night feeling wired as fuck. Feeling like shit, wanting to go sleep but its impossible. Fucking horrible mate I&#039;m telling ya!

				yeah man it ain&#039;t pretty. the day after a session i&#039;m just drained, but it&#039;s the next week that really gets me. hence why i had a week off work sick after caning a gram and a half of mandy the other weekend. i&#039;m able to control the depression a bit better now, so i don&#039;t split up with the mrs or get myself sacked, but it&#039;s still pretty bad. line of coke sorts it out if it&#039;s that bad ;)<br /><br />done speed a few times, it&#039;s not really my thing - hate that jittery thing you get with it. that&#039;s why i hate bad coke, gives me the jitters. only ever did speed just after lunch as well, so i could get to sleep at a reasonable hour. tried a line the very first time and it didn&#039;t really do anything, so just bombed&nbsp; the rest of the gram in one. give me the jitters and bulging eyeballs and made me flap a lot, didn&#039;t really enjoy it<br /><br />ain&#039;t had local pills in years mosh, just dunno where to get them these days, all my mandys from the road. apart from that 1.5 i did the other weekend, my bro has some local sources

				A gram and a half of Mandy? Fuck me, that&#039;s a lot! Maximum I&#039;ve done was 250mgs in one bomb, (Was Ivory&#039;s MD) then a 60mgs top up, so 310mgs all together. But that gave me the eye wiggles to FUCK, and my jaw was saw the next day from all the jaw clenching. <br /><br />A gram and a half would send me off my fucking nut! Apparently, once you go over the half G mark it gets trippy? Is that true? I&#039;ve heard once you go over 500mgs, MD turns to MDA in your body. Could be bollocks, but I read it on Bluelight once. Still, hope you had a good time mate! <br /><br />Yeah, it can cause anxiety. This person on another thread is thinking of combining it with Weed! Fuck me, I&#039;d have a panic attack doing that. Weed (for me) gives me bad anxiety - hence why I don&#039;t smoke it. I&#039;ve panicked from just weed itself before. Agreed though with MD its nice, I find it increases the body euphoria MD gives. And causes no anxiety and paranoia because I&#039;ve got MD in my system.<br /><br />Yeah street pils have Meth/Speed mixed with them. Which is why people use to say MD is stimulating, but on it&#039;s own (without any shit mixed with it), its relaxing. I even sometimes feel a little groggy on it, have you had this RD? MD on its own is&nbsp; the &#039;relaxing&#039; amphetamine. Surprising really, as some of it chemical structure is similar to &#039;Methamphetamine&#039;.

				the 1.5 was over about 8 hours, but was after a bit of home washed coke so it was under control. my tongue was fucking ruined for the next few days and my back teeth were proper sharp where i was gurning<br /><br />i have hallucinated on pills before, when i first started getting into them (when they were good in the UK, back in the 90&#039;s) i ate 5, and i had proper hallucinations on it. it weren&#039;t trippy like lucy, with the walls breathing and shit, but i actually saw one of my mates sat at the end of my bed when there was no one there. i had to reach out to go to touch him and he didn&#039;t disappear until my hand went through him. that was pretty fucked up<br /><br />yeah i prefer monging at home on good mandy - chain smoke joints and get some house/DnB/speed garage/dub step on - fucking bliss mate

				not for a while mate - the 1.5 has fucked with my head a bit so it&#039;s gonna be a month at least, then i gotta order some more from here so i don&#039;t think that shit off my bro was that good. it weren&#039;t bad, but as i said - i got through a g and a half.<br /><br />don&#039;t let that thread get to you mate, they&#039;re determined but the whole thread has been shown to be bollocks. the last question i asked them was completely balanced to the thread and no cunt can give me a reply - shows them for what they are doesn&#039;t it really

				yeah was pretty freaked out by it - this was the end of the night as well, was lying in bed, just got in after a night out, pitch black room, just happened to look at the end of my bed and my mates sat there, just rocking back and forward staring at me. thats the only time i&#039;ve hallucinated off them though. think it was when i first started doing them as well, pretty sure i&#039;d only had&nbsp; a few nights on them before that. then i ate 5 of the cunts ::)<br /><br />i&#039;ve never puked on mandy, ever. bombed half a gram in one once as well. for a bet i might add - was pissed up at the time

				Hash? Nah, never bothered since all the best prices are international, and I cbf lol. But weed, definitely CaliforniaBuddy. I think he only ships in the US right now though :-\. I gotta say the one thing that I still buy irl is weed, mainly because I don&#039;t want a package showing up at my drop wreaking of weed lol. I want to try 20dollarBill&#039;s 4 gram&#039;s of mids for 20$ though, I haven&#039;t had mids in so long. Makes great blunt filler :).

I&#039;ve had about 5g over 24 hours now and I&#039;m pretty much bone dry and don&#039;t need any grease proof paper. <br /><br />It&#039;s pretty big shit I know but I said I&#039;ll be doing samples and that&#039;s what I&#039;ll be doing. :)

				Like I said. None of the 5 of us that have tried it so far have had the sweats, the grease, the chemically smell (you always get the drug smell a bit but not the MEPH) smell and every time you do a line it hits the same every time and the euphoria is stronger without the jittery tweaker shit. <br /><br />Prices for the 50g batch are £25 a gram, when the keys land which the first one WILL be reserved for SR the price will drop to £20 per gram. The leys are en route so sall tense now for the wait.<br /><br />Tell you what I am FUCKING excited to hear what people say about this because I was speechless and fuck me, it goes great with Blow.

				Yes this is the only type of Mephedrone I will be stocking once the powder has been sold (I&#039;ll sorting out a nice sale on that tomorrow to shift it quick as well). This sample batch I believe is 96.9% but the keys will all be 99.5+ but I&#039;d like to get 99.9 every time. But like I said though I guarantee this will be the best product on SR unless someone very clever comes along. I&#039;ve never had nothing like it, normally I feel like a fucking porter loo after a binge and I&#039;ve done roughly 5g and I&#039;m bone dry and smelling great. Fuck it I&#039;d almost say I&#039;m date worthy lol.

But they do produce &#039;Local&#039; pills and Burma supplies H &amp; Methamphetamine...Bud growers all over OZ.

				Morning guys. Gotta admit, feeling fairly peng considering the bender I&#039;ve been on and no massive Mephpression or anything along those lines. I gotta say though I did find a smell point but this was just before I had a bath and once I had one last night it was gone and it was very minor to the point only just noticed today. Didn&#039;t come back either and I don&#039;t feel like a greasy chemical toilet today. <br /><br />Fucking hungry though, getting on a pizza I reckon.

Post mortem samples showed the concentration of mephedrone in their blood was 22 mg/l in one case and 3.3 mg/l in the other.[107] The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes.[45] In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone.[106][108] According to Fiona Measham, a criminologist who is a member of the ACMD, the reporting of the unconfirmed deaths by newspapers followed &quot;the usual cycle of ‘exaggeration, distortion, inaccuracy and sensationalism&#039;&quot; associated with the reporting of recreational drug use.[31]&quot;<br /><br />( CLEARWEB ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephedrone#Deaths<br /><br />

				MDMA which we have just clinched a guy to properly do it now so it&#039;s deffo gunna be on the menu at some point I can make for about $800 a key (depending on route). Ket you can do for about $650-800 a key, Speed is ridiculously cheap and you can make it for about $300 a key. MDA I can&#039;t quite remember off hand but it&#039;s a bout $100 a key less than Mandy. Cocaine I can get all the different bits to make it the Colombian Jungle method for $6000.

Because I got tired of paying fucking silly prices even though I knew how much things really cost to make. It&#039;s not easy getting into production, in fact it&#039;s piss-hard but fuck am I working like a dog for someone who makes a mint off my back. I wana be Don Jaun, not his bitch. I get pretty annoyed when you see your local Dave walking around even if they are doing a fair bit of trade walking around thinking they are &quot;Bad Man Ting&quot; because they are not even a grain of sand in the grand scheme of things. Like the fat cunt who serves you at McDonald&#039;s, nothing more and nothing less.

Just good ones. The Meph I was thinking of raising the price of because it&#039;s just that good to maybe £6000 a key but I think I decided to keep it at £4500-5000, the Ket when that is done will be £5000 a key and the Mandy I dunno because that&#039;s in the early stages of life yet.

				Yeah I wouldn&#039;t even know where to start, unless I started my own production lab here and ran it myself and only made small amounts. I would have no idea where to look to employ anyone who knows how to do everything ether, I&#039;m guessing you have to know people. But even then getting hold of the materials needed can&#039;t be that easy. Though, I am almost certainly going into this kind of industry for my career, the legal version obviously... hmm. Must be extremely profitable when it pulls off. Just risky as fuck though!

				Yeah I think he was, OPI has now gone...There is now another more varied selling, rapidly rising within 2 months, Canadian vendor who is selling exactly the same products as Tony was before he went, same professional service, same rare products, same layout on profile.....The other guy Noriega was from Dam....I got a package off an NL vendor from Dam, same packaging, same products and quite a rare product within the EU, and no-one in EU has had it since. Same pricing, same kind of language on profile....I am pretty fucking sure I know who they are....If i&#039;m wrong, i&#039;d eat my hat....and that would be ruffff!!<br /><br />As long as you don&#039;t FE, it&#039;s OK but still bad knowing they ripped a load of peeps....But I guess I&#039;ll never really know....Just a major hunch I have!!!<br /><br />No, not seen this TV show....

				Yeah I have to agree with the &#039;Drug Snob&#039; attitude. Whenever someone mentions drugs IRL I&#039;m just thinking to myself, ppffftt, bet I can get stuff that&#039;s 50times better than your shit. ;)<br /><br />I think just head out to town with a few mates and get wavey. Can&#039;t get to fucked as i&#039;ve got Deadmau5 tomorrow!

Yeah I was hitting bongs n shit to bring on the effects and I noticed I felt like I was coming up a bit after like 15 mins or so....Was really liking the buzz but as I said I felt it more like a ravey drug like MD as I got rushes and that gloweyness on everything.....When I hit that 10mg line of 2C-B that changed the whole perspective and became quite acid like....I had everyone here in stitches as I was trolleyed just chatting the most random madness n rolling round the floor in bits!! hahahaha had a sick night man, just finishing it off with a bit of local coke which is the standard stuff @£150 a ball but actually is not too bad quality considering and I just sold off few 0.7g bags n got it for next to nothing so cant grumble :)....What bout you Moks? Any shit gwarnin in your endz bruv??

				Yeah Moks....That is actually expensive compared to some street coke in UK but it&#039;s worth the extra £30 as it&#039;s way better than other street stuff round these ways. Just needed to get somethin in while waitin on my Canadian scaley friend.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing the coke in OZ is good but mega expensive??

				Based on my first impression 5-MeO-MiPT could easily be one of my top ten. ;) It was sort of different than rolling bust sweet Jesus I felt like a giant vibrating dildo stuck up god&#039;s orgasmic vagina... and it was more of an afterglow rather than a crash so woohoo! ;D

				I&#039;m sound mate... now without sounding completely dumb, what the fuck is that? :P<br /><br />I&#039;m in a pickle, can&#039;t get sleep... too much on my mind. I&#039;m contemplating having a few of my cans, popping some Vallies and chilling out. But I have to be up at 9, out the house at 10 as I promised my mate I&#039;d go to the Golf driving range with him tomorrow. <br /><br />Thing is, I can&#039;t get sleep sober, but if I drink and pop some Vallies, by the time I&#039;ve finished, I&#039;ll only be able to get 4 hours sleep anyway. And with all that in my system, I&#039;ll be groggy anyway.<br /><br />Ahhh.. the decisions...<br /><br />EDIT: Hey Blargh, that&#039;s a great idea mate. And hey, you have this thread so chat all the shit you like throughout the night ;) hehe.<br /><br />

				WoooooHooooo!!! Bare sleep!!!!!!!!! Took a couple of diazies n chain smoked bongs n passed out! phheeeeeewwww!!!!<br /><br />Moksha mate, Dubstep scene is kind of two tiered now....Like Drum n Bass, it has got several sub genres and to be honest a lot of it is BOLLOCKS nowadays....I used to be purely into Dubstep around 2006/7 but there is so much crunchy shit with gash vocals and is not really music....It&#039;s just a collection of rank noises &amp; frequencies! I&#039;m getting back to my roots n more into DnB again at the mo.<br /><br />That said, I do still love the deep dubby shit like Youngsta, Kromestar &amp; Jay5ive....Plastician with his Grimey edge, Zeds Dead are good Canadian producers for harder shit, 16bit Milky Pie Mix is just the dogs knackers from 2008!!!!!! Check it here <br /><br />http://soundcloud.com/16bit/16bit-the-milky-pie-mix <br /><br />and gotta love Newham Generals (D Double E) &amp; P Money on the mic at a rave!!! BOOM!!!

				Yep, Tourette&#039;s Guy used to be the cat&#039;s pajamas. ;D Also 25c is so much better than 25i in my opinion, it&#039;s just lighter on the body and I think the visuals are stronger.. or at least more colorful! ;)

				What do they plan on changing? The same fucking thing the filthy socialists try in every country they rise to power.. Punish the rich and spoil the useless.<br /><br />The polls have the biggest socialist party at 36 of 150 parliament chairs and biggest liberal party 36/150 chairs as well. ::) But seeing the momentum the socialists have at the moment (risen like 15 chairs last 2 weeks) they might as well win it. :-\<br /><br />

Also the integration thing is actually generational and not cultural, all the first immigrants who are quite conservative in the U.K and the new generation are noway near as strict as their parents so you&#039;ll find that once it&#039;s just the new generation left integration will come much more easily.

It looks like the monsoon finally reached me as it&#039;s rained practically nonstop since last night, so I&#039;m praying I at least got my methylone so I can go out and play in the rain. ^-^ None of my cannabis orders have arrived yet and for some reason my orders from hashbean have been processing for over a week now despite him sending me a message saying my orders were shipped on Saturday. Not sure if I should just cancel them and order that budder a bit early. :(

				It&#039;s 98% pure Tramadol HCL mate. I never even heard of O-Desmethyltramadol, sounds fucking scary to me. Basically this is what people who make Tramadol Tablets buy to make their pills out of, we got it from someone who makes it for those kinds of companies. I&#039;m not really into selling Opiates but Tramadol is pretty tame and I got very good prices. :)<br /><br />Here are the prices - <br /><br />1g - £10 <br />5g - £40<br />10g - £80<br />25g - £160<br />50g - £280<br />100g - £480<br />250g - £800<br />500g - £1350

				Nah not if you roll it evenly so the adhesive sticks to the paper itself. You have to get the good quality ones though otherwise they can unroll. If you roll them round in your fingers over and over it makes sure the adhesive sticks too.

The batch size will be big enough to guarantee highest quality Mandy at those prices per kilo though and it&#039;ll be available through escrow in multi-kilo quantities. I have to do one product at a time which means the first large scale batch of Meph, then the K and then I can move on to the MDMA but obviously each product has it&#039;s own logistical and funding issues that have to be taken care of which is why it&#039;s one at once. We do sample batches of each one and then push through to the larger batch so each one is essentially a process.

Won&#039;t be checking him again and its a bit mad as it is scaley!!!<br /><br />Got my DMT changa through today too so all orders have arrived safe and sound with NO issues from Royal Mail, just gotta catch this off C63 prob Monday now before it gets here, but looking forward to that after all this time!!!!&nbsp; :)

Pretty dodgy on the mail tho - ordered from Dutch 5 days after c63 and I&#039;m still waiting on c63&#039;s :-/ Dutch was from DE though rather than NL - fuck ordering from there again I reckon. <br /><br />Pretty smashed ATM, drinking like a mofo on this gear.<br /><br />Who&#039;s the new faces in this thread?

				Safe! Yeah I checked Dutchaanbod before for coke and it was good! 20% refund though if it goes walkies.....Bit low??!! Might give him a shot for a bit of MD &amp; Coke end of the month as I&#039;ve still not had a lost package off anyone, though C63 said he sent this out but I don&#039;t reckon he did before but it seems as though he has this time with more communication involved, I&#039;m fairly sure it&#039;s on it&#039;s way!! :) Will see next week though I guess but I know the address is cool as I had another order go there just to see if was OK still and it got through no worries!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Glad you got some sniff though now mate to let ya hair down after a week of work!!

Oh and I&#039;d like everyone to focus on #3. 8)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are numerous dangers inherent to dealing with women, although you probably don&#039;t need to know them because you already have plans that don&#039;t involve them. For posterity, however, we&#039;ll outline the following risks: In addition to the fact that they&#039;re all batshit crazy, a man must be aware the following perils associated with pursuing a relationship with a woman:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Under no circumstances should you do what a woman tells you to. You have to learn to sense what she wants, not what she says she wants.<br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Women lack verbal communication skills, logic, and coherence in their weepy, melodramatic ramblings. Despite this, in addition to adhering to #1 above, you must create the illusion that her psychotic, incoherent babble makes sense. Failing in this, she will start to cry (see below) and the fucktarded, insane prattle will only amplify, leaving limited options to shutting her up.<br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dangers #1 and 2 exist because all women are attention whores. There are no exceptions. It is a law of nature and nothing can be done to change it.<br />4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Incorrectly configured Toilet Seats can easily trigger #2.<br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Through a combination of mindfucking and jiggling boobies, women will attempt to coerce men into a form of servitude known as the &quot;Friend Zone&quot; or worse, marriage. Both of these should be avoided at all costs, as they have all the drawbacks of a girlfriend with feeble to non-existent sex.<br />6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Said mindfucking will permanently turn you into a faggot in no time.<br />7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Women will call the cops if you prove them wrong too much. Aim for the back of the head - cops can&#039;t see bruises covered by hair.<br />8.&nbsp; &nbsp; Never let a woman drive.<br />9.&nbsp; &nbsp; Never let them read Cosmopolitan. It may trick them into thinking they have some use beyond food preparation and fucking.<br />10.&nbsp; &nbsp; Medical evidence suggests women can survive on attention and sperm alone. Starve her of the former and forcefeed her the latter. If she insists on eating something other than cum, promptly induce an eating disorder by subtly asking if she&#039;s gained weight every other day.<br />11.&nbsp; &nbsp; Women don&#039;t play video games. Such activities require too much of their pea-sized brains.<br />12.&nbsp; &nbsp; Prolonged association with a woman will result in insanity (as theirs is contagious), staggering levels of faggotry, and ultimately an hero. <br /><br />Fact: There are no girls on the internets.[no citation needed]<br /><br />There are no girls on the internet no matter what. That girl who wrote your name on her tits for you. Its a dude who can photoshop your name on a pair of tits he found on Google images. Congratulations you sent a picture of your dick to that man.<br /><br />If by some accident a girl does access the internet, she is either fat, ugly, or a trap. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I thought this one was great as well, it too deserves recognition. ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One of my favorite rap songs of all time says Bitches Ain&#039;t Shit. I couldn&#039;t agree more. Truer words were never spoken, folks. Lots of good men hook up with what appears to be decent women and eventually these men discover that there&#039;s no such thing as a decent woman. All women are bitches. All of them without exception. Your mother. Your daughter. Your wife. Your aunt. The hooker down the street. The female lawyer in her office. The female senator on the senate floor. The librarian in your town. The policewoman in the squad car. Get the picture? I know that you wish it weren&#039;t so. In all likelihood, you&#039;re a decent guy. You work hard. You&#039;re smart. You contribute energetically to society. You&#039;d like to eventually meet a decent woman and have a family.<br /><br />That&#039;s what men have been socially conditioned to look for. And men have held their part of the bargain. it&#039;s women who haven&#039;t held their part of the bargain. the thing is that women have absolutely no conscience. It&#039;s something they were all born without. Have you ever seen a woman truly feel guilt over anything she&#039;s ever done? I need you to think about this question. Seriously. Right now, you&#039;re running a thousand different images in your head. If you&#039;re honest with yourself, you will see that I am right. Women cannot feel remorse. Or guilt. That&#039;s because they have no conscience. That&#039;s why they never keep their word, unless it somehow benefits them. There are no female exceptions to the malady of remorselessness which affects one hundred percent of the female population. I&#039;m sorry. I truly am. I wish things were different. You have no idea how much.<br /><br />However, the truth must be told. There are no good women on the planet. Simply because women have no conscience. You have a better chance of meeting a unicorn in New York City. Just ask a certain European prince who married a gold-digger whom he&#039;d been boning for three decades. As soon as she got the ring around her finger, she began singing a different tune. Acting like a real bitch. Now she wants to take him for everything he&#039;s got. See? That&#039;s what you get when you treat a bitch better than she deserves. Men were made to rule the universe and bitches were made to serve them. End of story. Anyone who disagrees should just look up statistics. In the name of equality, women in college are slashing men&#039;s sports teams and adding their own.<br /><br />In the name of equality, wives are stealing their husbands estates with the complicity of judges and leaving their men at the poorhouse. In the name of justice, female murderers are given a free pass on everything they do while their male counterparts either get life imprisonment or an execution. See what I mean? It&#039;s a sad state of the affairs, folks. I couldn&#039;t make this shit up. Sometimes, I wonder why men still bother with the whole marriage thing. Or even moving together with women. Separate but equal, that&#039;s how it should be. Men should just go to work, earn a living and have fun. Don&#039;t date or marry women. Just find a slut to fuck whenever they get horny. I have a solution for that. We should legalize prostitution.<br /><br />Men can spend a few hundred dollars every week and get laid by a slut who&#039;s paid to do it rather than to risk their livelihood and their lives in a relationship with a bitch whom feminist taught to have a sense of entitlement. The average legal prostitute charges a few hundred dollars for her services. The average divorce costs a lot more than that. See what I mean? It&#039;s more cost-effective for a man to seek the company of prostitutes when he gets horny than to bother with dating or marriage. It&#039;s not misogyny, just a fact. Men waste a lot of time in the pursuit of women&#039;s hearts. The truth is that men have a lot more important things to do.<br /><br />We can take care of ourselves. Women play the gender card and the pity card, blackmailing the government into funding women&#039;s social service programs, women&#039;s shelters and women&#039;s resource centers. Who pays for all these endeavors? Women seldom donate to women&#039;s causes. That&#039;s why they have us men for. They smile while we do the heavy lifting. They&#039;re naturally stupider than we are. We&#039;re smart. And we pour our intelligence into things like science, mathematics, art, sociology, research, philosophy, comic books, movies, etc. We thrust human society into bold new directions with our ideas. Women never have original ideas. They have a talent for emotional manipulation, deception and sexual exploitation. There&#039;s no correlation between these attributes of theirs and a high IQ.<br /><br />The dumbest woman on earth knows things about manipulation that the smartest man might not know. Why? Simply because we&#039;re too good and too smart to bother with such petty things. We were created in God&#039;s Image. Women were an afterthought. Like an extra patio after building a house. Such structures are usually redundant. What I&#039;m asking men everywhere is to stand up for themselves. Women won&#039;t do it for them. What do women think of crazy women who slaughter their sons and daughters like a certain Texan gal and fake insanity to get away with murder? Women should be outraged. Instead, they stand by the crazy women who murder innocent men along with their sons and daughters. That&#039;s because deep down women have absolutely no conscience. They know what right and wrong are, they just don&#039;t care.<br /><br />The Male Sociopath comprises five percent of the male population. The Female Sociopath comprises one hundred percent of the female population. I&#039;m sorry if this shocks or bothers you but the truth simply must be told. The female sociopath is better at hiding what she is and what she does than her male counterpart. That doesn&#039;t mean there are fewer females among the ranks of the sociopath subspecies. It just means they&#039;re well-hidden.<br /><br />Men, we are in bad shape. There are no national campaigns to help male victims of domestic abuse. There are no shelters for battered men. There are no runs for prostate cancer. No charities for prostate cancer research. No ribbons for prostate cancer awareness. Why? Simply because it&#039;s a disease that affects men and women don&#039;t give a damn about men. Even worse, men have been brainwashed to think of themselves as unworthy of being cared for. They put women&#039;s interests ahead of their own. That is such foolishness. Men need to wake up. Women don&#039;t love you. They don&#039;t care about you. They will marry you, take your money, your house, your car and your sons and daughters. And they will use the women-controlled justice system to do it. Women are always saying they want careers. Truth is they&#039;re naturally lazy. They go to college and into the formerly male-dominated workforce because they want power. They will snatch up an available man based on his financial profile more than anything else and rob him of house and home...legally! Men need to wake up and learn to protect themselves. Donate to men&#039;s causes. Open up men&#039;s resource centers. Donate to men&#039;s health research. Don&#039;t be so quick to condemn your fellow men in court no matter how guilty they appear. The truth is that manipulative women can make the most innocent of men look like monsters. And the courts usually buy into their lies. Don&#039;t buy into their lies. Protect your fellow man. Protect yourself. And last but not least, don&#039;t trust women. They&#039;re not worthy of your trust. Peace.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yeah it&#039;s been a little while coming mate but it was about a month but I don&#039;t think it was due to slow post or customs, I just don&#039;t think he sent it last time!!! It was a reship as I complained about how poor quality his H was the last time I got off him and I said I never wanted that H again so I said I would settle for the freebase, so then he said he would send me both as gesture of goodwill and that was a month ago. It did come eventually but he had said he would send a G of each but he only sent half G of each, however as I only paid for a gram in the first place, I cannot moan about that!!! Gutted you had to go through reso with him RD......<br /><br />Soll.....That is pretty dumb bruv, I&#039;m sorry to agree with you but you are correct!!! hahha&nbsp; ;D ;)

				I still go to the gym yeah - But the fact I stop off at the shop to get a Snickers bar when I go kinda defeats the purpose there. I did try going on Creatine (Not to lose weight, it helps get energy in to your muscles for short bursts of energy when weight training) see the plan is to lose weight, whilst gaining muscle. But Creatine gave me the fucking shits... and horrible stomach cramps.<br /><br />Do you smoke Mok? As in Tobacco? Get yourself back at the Gym man... I smoke and I&#039;m overweight - So I&#039;m pretty unfit. The Treadmill is great! The exercise bike is crap IMO. Makes me sweat like a bastard, but it doesn&#039;t get my heart going. Just makes me sweat and makes my legs ache. The rowing machine is good too. :P But don&#039;t take my advice lol.. I&#039;m far far from an expert on fitness lol

				Oh and a couple of other things, first being you should all listen to this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5bJGsjq2Q4 and the second being that I just got some of the best feedback ever and it was so good I actually messaged the customer to say thanks for making the effort with it. Damn man, actually made my night that did.<br /><br />You just have to do a bit of searching and ask around in ya local area mate, what kind of dance music you into? Generally if you are in a big city each scene has it&#039;s own little spot. Sometimes you have to travel to see really bangin nights. I go into London to go to Fabric a lot. :)<br /><br />And yeah Soll loves his shit, have you never tried it Mokka? You want a sample?

				They are ok, I&#039;m not so much into that kind of music. I will listen to it but my real like, I dunno, what I listen to all the time is Drum and Bass basically. I live and breath it really - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3HQKItxgmI this is a favourite of mine and this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioXONRj4iSI<br /><br />Blu Mar Ten are really underrated IMO, although I am not into their new stuff. Anyway this is what I listen to on a day-to-day basis.

				Wicked mate! Thank god it&#039;s so cheap too, I won&#039;t feel so bad if I start to fiend off it now. :D Anyone know of any cross-tolerance issues with MDMA, MDA, or M1? If not I&#039;ll probably end up adding it to my monthly rotation. I like switching between different subgroups of psychedelics so my tolerance stays level with each of them so it&#039;ll be nice to add a nice stimulant into the mix. :))

				Lol you wont fiend, you just go through it when ya have it. And in terms of cross tolerance if you take it before MDMA or MDA it may not push through fully especially with MDMA. With M1 if you take them together it can give you an MDMA like roll and a massive rush when you snort them together. Meph is a stimulant mate, I&#039;d recommend trying it on it&#039;s own first time round. :)<br /><br />

				I fucking love how people still get offended by things said over the internet, people are overemotional idiots I swear. ::) It makes me thankful for being born the way I am, if I ever feel the need to experience &#039;feelings&#039; I can take a psychedelic to bring them forth under appropriate situations or use smiley faces to convey said &#039;feelings&#039; through text. :))<br /><br />So in other news I&#039;m contemplating bombing the last of my 4-AcO-DMT from DrGozo to watch Finding Nemo 3D tomorrow and will be riding my bike there and back.. will probably stop by a park on my way back to toke. ^-^&nbsp; Oh and I bought Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures on Blu-ray for one of those days where it&#039;s too hot to trip outdoors, that should be fun to watch on acid. ;D It&#039;s still above 100°F this entire week so it looks like I should start planning. Oh and I still need to watch Fight Club for when I take a Tyl3rdurden 25c cap for the first time not to mention The Breakfast Club for when I bomb the rest of Utopics M1.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m not a true hippie for adventuring outside every time I trip but what else can I do? I&#039;m pretty positive none of you spend 200 days of the year in 100° heat, about 75 of which usually fall during the monsoon season which means blistering heat AND 60% humidity. :&#039;(

Only problems are cross-tolerances and I have a lot of time off which makes me impatient between trips, so I don&#039;t see how I&#039;ll figure out a method to consume either one as much as I&#039;d like too which means I might have to stash them for quite a length of time which seems like such a shame. :-\<br /><br /><br />Are there any drugs out there that I&#039;d enjoy that aren&#039;t cross-tolerant with my beloved psychedelics? As my stash keeps getting bigger I&#039;m finding myself at a loss of what to do without diminished effects.

				The reason why I like the Daniel Craig Bond films so much is because for me he is what Bond is spozed to be and it doesn&#039;t have any of the cheesy bullshit that the previous films have. He&#039;s just kick-ass in every way and not a sleaze.

				the only cheesey bullshit bond i liked was Roger Moore, just because the films cheeseyness were part of the age they were filmed. the storylines and plots got more extravent,but bond was still epic. <br /><br />Connery,Moore &amp; Craig = best bonds.<br /><br />All others can suck on my foot, especially Pierce Brosnan. Golden Eye was ok..ish but everything else he made under the bond name was a disgrace.

I can see your point of view but the War is inevitable. As much as I&#039;d like for people to do that, the illiteracy of first world countries is too high for that to happen. Also most countries have agencies specifically for the intent to disperse any groups that would incite a revolution. Along with the media conglomerate, that&#039;s probably the last thing to succeed at the moment.<br /><br />And in any event, I&#039;d honestly aid a quicker extinction so the advanced hideaway technology can be released after the war (happens after every world war).

				I got without a doubt the stupidest message I have ever had today - <br /><br />Hi<br />Sorry to contact you like this as I have only joined today but maybe we could do some business.&nbsp; I understand the secrecy with everything on here given what we are dealing with but I would be interested in supplying you with UK manufactured P2NP and would be happy to send a free samples or post photos of stuff that I have ready just now.&nbsp; To be honest I can make it for under £ 300 a kg so there would be enough for us both to make some money on it and of course its legal.I have enough stuff to make almost 1,5 kg this week and can do 10 each week without any difficulty. If this is bad etiquette then I apologise. I would also be interested in trading for some other stuff you have if you are not interested in a cash deal. I know that you do not know who I am but I would be happy to send you 500g and you can pay me when you have received it. You have a good rep on here and if your meph is as good as reports say then you would be mad to bolt for a half kg of nitropropene..<br />I look forward to hearing from you if you think that we could have a mutual arrangement.<br /><br />Seriously, what the fuck????

				EZ Moks, you know Nevita sells changa but he just aint got any listed now. The other guy sadly did not vac but was sealed well, but its pretty smell-less anyway, certainly not what a dog would be trained to smell for. :-\<br /><br />On the Karma tip, I&#039;m creepin up to 90 now so nearly there...... 8)<br /><br />Still pondering who to get Cocaine off this time, Skippyjif looks to have some good shit washed at reasonable price for washed stuff and claims to have done acetone, ethyl &amp; chloro wash too, also I&#039;m tempted to just get a balla off SuperTrips instead of a couple off diff guys like Skip &amp; Dutchaan or FM as it&#039;s apparently the best batch he&#039;s had yet (audi block), though it is good to try a couple to hedge ya bets on both quality and arrival time! But I&#039;ll be getting coins in pretty soon so need to decide.....eeeek decisions decisions!! My favourite kinda shopping!! lol

Taking advantage of this for sure. ::)<br />Yessss Gdog, this is my favorite kinda shopping too. ;) decisions decisions.. <br /><br />You guys seen this program about MDMA on channel 4 that&#039;s gunna be on tomorrow night?

I&#039;m also gonna put in a Moxy order this month, been meaning to for the last couple of months but so many other drugs I wanted to try first but it is Moxy&#039;s time pretty soon!! Especially as I&#039;ve got a couple of girls interested in my Moxy party now!!! Mwahahahaha should be an interesting one! &gt;:D<br />

So gay, high fiving n shit!?!..... :P haha ;)<br /><br />Gary I too love my stash!! I&#039;m trying to keep up with you mate!! :) No-one else I would go to for psychedelic advice.....Gonna roll with those snuff caps this time round on the 25c. Still not braved the DOB and the 4-ACO-DMT Lim kindly sent has turned black as I never knew it would go off in a coolish, dry environment, but it has, feel bad as it was so nice of Lim to send it to me. I&#039;m also gonna put in a Moxy order this month, been meaning to for the last couple of months but so many other drugs I wanted to try first but it is Moxy&#039;s time pretty soon!! Especially as I&#039;ve got a couple of girls interested in my Moxy party now!!! Mwahahahaha should be an interesting one! &gt;:D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The strange thing about moxy for me was it felt like a strong nootropic, or an exaggerated sense of clarity I would say, combined with euphoria comparable to MDMA. I&#039;m picking up some from kwiktrip as well the moment I save up some more, fucking love the stuff like cats love catnip. ;D I don&#039;t understand how people can not like it but I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s effects are a bit random with people. ??? Nice choice with getting 25c too, I got mine from Tyler awhile back and they&#039;re insane! Sucks to hear about that 4-AcO-DMT, I read that happened to another member awhile back. Weird how that happens. Anywho good luck with the ladies, don&#039;t forget protection or you&#039;ll have a little hoffa running around. :&#039;(

				Alrite guys!! Hows ting? You finally getting it together with the MDMA n Ket then? You&#039;ve been on about that since you started on road dude! Smart move though away from Meph...It&#039;s cheap and lets face it, MDMA is a much better and more in demand drug!!!! Speaking of that, did you watch that on C4 last night?? The MDMA thing? I thought it was pretty good to be honest!! Gonna watch again tonight for part 2....<br /><br />Shiz what&#039;s crackalackin? Sun is out here so gonna potter about n see the famo today....Been a while! :) Hit my last DMT pipe last night and a mate got in touch to say he has some LSA seeds so quite keen to try those!!

				I&#039;m off my tits on Meph and have just had my faith in humanity restored by an aggy customer sending me this to say sorry -<br /><br />Hi Lim<br /><br />Im really very sorry and quite embarrassed. I took a break for a few days and ate plenty of protein to get my dopamine levels back up and the second batch is very very good and has all the hallmarks of a high mephedrone content. When I saw it had a different appearance and didnt give anywhere as good effect, I assumed the worst and was wrong. The problem was with me problem was with me and not the gear.<br /><br />I was drunk and disappointed not to have the same great experience I did with the first batch and should have waited and given it another chance before doubting youand the gear. The truth is you are the most honest and trustworthy vendor here, hopefully you can forgive me?<br /><br />Sorry, <br /><br />Damn man, that&#039;s some heartfelt shit!

				Ah man in that MDMA program they mentioned people having a strong bond together or heightened feelings for one another for time AFTER taking MDMA. I thought this was just me!

				Ah jealous, I wanted to go see him on his tour but he ain&#039;t coming anywhere in London, so shit. :( <br />Yeah I like both his &#039;mainstream&#039; type DnB and I&#039;ve always been a fan of the hard jungle shit so he&#039;s a good all round artist to be fair. One of my favorite songs of all time is his VIP mix of Rusko&#039;s - Everyday. Tunnneeeee :D Sounds different to his jungle stuff, but still has the Netsky feel to it.

				So the no vote has the lead so far, the &#039;Oh fuck no!&#039; vote, that would be. The majority here must be married!<br /><br />If I asked a &#039;trick&#039; to join myself and the wife, my penis would be seperated from my groin area. My balls also I would surmise, would be somehow seperated from my person.<br /><br />I think its lucky my wife will take a little cocaine sometimes. She can role play as a trick.<br /><br />Time to buy some coke!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />But not from this account as I want to become a vendor and be an SR God who does look down kindly on his creations.<br /><br />I might sell used knickers. I can sneak them out of the washing machine, if I can open it. Never used one to be honest. <br /><br />Also, I could my own soiled underwear. The moral objections versus 10 bitcoins conversation in my head has already blessed this venture.<br /><br />Used condoms? If there is a market I would pick them up from the local teenagers &#039;hang-out&#039; or just make some myself.<br /><br />I would prefer to some artwork for you but not yet, I&#039;m busy, and not a vendor, just someone&nbsp; who is interested in the study of human behaviour and this thread starter is a person of interest. Wish I could join you in the hotel room for moral support and to perhaps photograph the developing scene for the sake of &#039;art&#039;. <br /><br />I could also photograph my own genitals. I actually have or the wife did once or twice. Cocaine I would hazard. Best check the camera actually before someone faints at the size of it.<br /><br />For 45 btc you could be fainting tronight but only when I become a vendor so SR can share with me, the proceeds of artwork.<br /><br />Can photograph hookers also as long as I blur out the face. <br /><br />Thanks for the read.<br /><br />Very interesting actually.<br /><br />Hope your counsellors are good, is all I can say.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Ah, bit pissed off in a way. Bit of a mad Weekend, got a Contract for the Iphone 5. Couldn&#039;t resist it, unlimited mins and texts, for 36 quid a month. Had to pay £300 towards the phone. (I have the 64GB version ;)). Went to London on Sat, got shitfaced, see, once I start drinking I can&#039;t stop... Plus the women serving was HAAWT... and so friendly.. Was talking to me mate and I must have left my Debit Card on the table when I left. Cancelled my card and the money for my first Month payment hasn&#039;t gone out. <br /><br />Orange has cut of my signal (Must be because they haven&#039;t received my first payment), I went in to the Orange Shop today feeling like a cunt... And got treated like one... Spoke to me like shit they did. They said they can&#039;t take my first payment in cash (I had the cash on me) because it&#039;s my first payment. And that I have to call Orange on 150. I can&#039;t do that because I have no signal... FUCKING PISSED OFF.<br /><br />Good weekend all in all though... how was yours?

				Yeah Shiz, brown sugar and mint is mojito mix but it works in vodka too. If you caramelize the sugar and pout little bits into ice cold shots it&#039;s buff-ting.

				What is nice about Symbi&#039;s product is that you can tell it wasn&#039;t cut with epsom salts before it was moon-rocked because when you crush it down the crystals come out at little uniform squares that need to be crushed again instead of going straight to dust. Bonus point for pure-shores. :)

				EZ G. I&#039;ve used MD for 17 years and it&#039;s def lost it&#039;s shine a little but I think it&#039;s the precursors more than the loss of effect through length of use as I only on average use it once a month or twice maybe. I&#039;m keen to try that off Sym after RD was bangin on bout it....I know he&#039;s been using it about same time frame as me! The old skool pills &amp; MD were way buzzier (though I take onboard that the pills would have other drugs in them too most likely) and I don&#039;t really gurn anymore!! But I guess it&#039;s because I&#039;ve learned to control it. Personally now, I have&nbsp; to supplement MD with other drugs to reach the effects I desire.<br /><br />Also G. That is one massive MD shopping list ya got there off 6 vendors for the same drug?? Wow you must really love MD!!!!!! You never fancied trying somethin new? You loved 2C-B!! ;)

Got a new link locally though, £220 a ball or £100 1g and I had some the other day, real nice floury texture, and smooth as fuck! Pretty well chuffed with it actually!! 1g lasted 3 of us an evening so well happy with that for local tings.<br /><br />Come see us more often DK!! Good to hear from ya geez!!!<br /><br />

Don&#039;t wanna be fucked up for that like!<br /><br />Mannnnn I loved Rome and all the Italian architecture.....Had a mint time there and in a town called Bracciano which is a gorgeous little town by a lake. Venice is nuts in the fact it&#039;s pure canals and NO roads....Well there is a big highway leading out to Venice from the mainland and is a terminal for busses etc but after that its all boats or on foot!! Buttttt I fucking don&#039;t like Italians!!! They are arrogant, rude and don&#039;t like English people, especially if you try to talk English to them....The guys are all slimey cunts with the girls and are very racist!! I was sooooo glad to get outta Venice &amp; Trieste to Croatia last year.....Such nicer people and just as nice coastline!

				Lol yeah sort of but I am not retiring yet, not by a long shot. I will still be on here for maybe 1-2 years but this is just &quot;restructuring of the Limetless Corporation&quot; where I can take a step back and take less of a hands on roll and more of a admin position. I&#039;ll still be on the forums and it&#039;ll still be me you are talking to if you order from me. It just wont be me doing the orders and dispatching them and I&#039;ll probably be typing my smart-arse comments in the hot sun whilst enjoying the views from a balcony rather than drinking co-op own-brand juice looking at it piss it down and feeling depressed. You never know, it may even curb my dick&#039;ed edge, who the fuck knows?<br /><br />At any rate, if you have that option what the fuck ya gunna choose yano? I know which one I chose ages ago and finally I can start living the dream. And yeah you&#039;ll be hearing all about it all the fucking time coz I know you fucks are gunna be well jel. LOL.&nbsp; 8)

				Funny story, that. About a year and a half-ago or so I was on 4chan browsing /b/ and some folks had a thread up about the &quot;deepweb&quot; and oh how it has all this crazy shit on it and all that. And I&#039;ve used tor before, I&#039;ve poked a .onion url or two already but that night I was just like... &quot;Eh, why not.&quot; and I loaded up the hidden-wiki... after about 10 minutes of it failing out on me. Mostly because the idiots were talking about how you can &quot;buy assassins!!!11one&quot;. And I browsed on down the list of links and I came across the drug-markets, and I thought to myself &quot;... Drugs? Online? I&#039;m in!&quot; so I opened them all... and only the Road loaded. And then the next day, Adrian Chen posted his gawker article about the Road, I guess.<br /><br />Before the user IDs were changed to hashes, I was number 25##. I don&#039;t remember the exact number but I know I was, just barely, ahead of the first rush... by a couple hours. As for the forums, I guess I just got lucky in checking the same day it was announced. I didn&#039;t even realize I was one of the first until a few months ago when I looked at the memberlist by the date-registered order.

				Oh god, that just reminded me... I heard of bitcoins when they were newer than new. I actually discovered the bitcoin faucer back in 2010, or maybe even 2009, but there was just... NOTHING about bitcoins anywhere back then, and no purpose to it or anything...<br /><br />Oh fuck, I wish had dug into it back then, started mining, and just built up a fortune... that would have made finding SR the best day in my life, I can tell you that. Especially when, a few days later, they jumped up to $30 per.<br /><br />I think I did even try to get involved in bitcoins at the time I first heard of them but there was next to no info about mining so the only way it looked like they could be used, or gotten, is through LiberyReserve and so I figured it was just a waste of time... Oh past-Blargh, I wish I could smack you so hard.

I can not trust anybody for bulk orders of LSD now because it&#039;s so easy to get scammed, LSD seems to be THE scammer tool on SR. Many sellers are building reputation and after a couple of months they list full sheets for too good to be true prices and they require everyone to FE.. I have seen so many scam like this in one year and that&#039;s happening again and again.. and again :(

				i had this posted in another topic, but it was deleted.<br /><br /><br />what i find interesting is all these people in the knitting circle putting their piece in, when they dont have facts. only those directly involved know whats happened, thats joey and hoffa and/or MIA<br /><br />i look at it like this. MIA sells gear to aussies. lots of it im guessing. lets put a figure on that. i would say an ounce a week? maybe more..... (lets just do the coke figures)<br /><br />now how much is that bought for off SR. average rate, lets say $3000 for an ounce of washed coke.<br />now thats broken down to $107 per gram. now resell that in aussie, on SR, for say $350 a gram. and lets be honest, thats going to fly off the shelves.<br />now 350 x 28grams = $9800<br /><br />lets say $400 a gram (still going to sell, judging by the rates of other aussie coke sellers)<br /><br />28 x $400 = $11,200<br /><br />now maybe im a retard, but honest to fucking christ on a cracker, WHY THE FUCK WOULD SOMEONE RISK THEIR REPUTATION FOR CHUMP CHANGE<br />and thats what it is. the figures dont lie. , to those saying hoffa started threads and planned this from the start, clearly you have been here for 10 fucking minutes.<br />you want a scam, search tony, search ptp, fuck the list goes on. now those were planned scams.. tony was hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br /><br />i would say a goose is easily parted with his monies,&nbsp; <br />posting private conversations and throwing accusations on half a dozen different threads etc...&nbsp; thats fucked. trying to reveal details about someone from inside information is even more fucked.<br />you didnt even email him. messages on SR are a dime a dozen for a busy vendor. you should know that.<br /><br /><br />hate me for saying it, i dont see a&nbsp; premeditated&nbsp; &quot;scam&quot; . <br /><br />i see someone whos name was dragged through the mud...who&nbsp; had enough of someone posting their private conversations, offered a resolution, to which he was called more names.<br />there is only so far you can push someone before they push back harder. had you not posted all that shit joey, im 100% certain you would have got your money back..<br /><br /><br />but im just another random on an anonymous drug forum.<br />bring on the flaming retorts ;D, or did i make some sense?<br /><br />blah!<br />

You wont be hard to pinpoint.<br />You have already openly admitted keeping your buyers addresses which goes against everything SR stands for.. BUYER SECURITY. Encryption or not, its wrong.<br />You mentioned your Australian vendor friends are also keeping address information. This will be reported to the admins, and I&#039;m sure we will find you.<br /><br />You better watch yourself, your posts, your grammar. You will be found, and should we get your &#039;dox&#039;, they will posted here, also the AFP will get a little profile of you.<br /><br />Good luck. You are going to need it.<br /><br />EDIT: What is this 50g you keep talking about? Only one person I know mentioned that, and he&#039;s a UK vendor.

				Yeah Hoffa did not need the money...He dished it out to people here so people knew he wasn&#039;t scamming you for his gain, he wasn&#039;t scamming you at all from content of our PM&#039;s together and yes he is a good cunt from how I know him and I think you were right Lim to not expect that from him! I feel bad for someone to lose 10k and that is why I felt bad the other day but upon reflection you dug your own grave on that one....WHO THE FUCK SENDS 10K OOE??? Then shoots his mouth off before speaking to the parties concerned at the first sniff of an issue....Like I said, you have just learned a BIG life lesson mate. Hard as it may be.<br /><br />Hoffa is a good mate on here and I stand by that.....Shiz, Lim, RD, DK, Moks etc IRC anyone?&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; ;D gotta hook up that shit ASAP will read on it now...<br /><br />Lets take the crew outta here n leave these guys to it! Between us we keep track of whats up on road anyways....Verbal Diarrhea 4 Life!! hahaha&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)

				no mate, you are correct in he never actually had any crystal, but he thought he did. much like the same way when i tell my mates &#039;yeah i&#039;ve got some cracking coke coming in&#039; then dutch, tv, min, CFMF and/or the rest of them disappear for whatever reason - i&#039;m left looking like a twat. in fact he contacted me out of the blue over a month ago saying he needed some crystal lucy and did i know anyone, he had a supplier but the cunt disappeared with a wedge of his cash, so it looks like he was scammed as well.<br /><br />the only difference is i had my mates $ and gave it straight back so they could score some 5% baking soda off a Dave, whereas hoffa truly believed he could score it somewhere - if you&#039;ve got enough cash you can get anything right - who does not believe that? well he was still trying up to the point it started getting a bit lemon, then something in him snapped and he&#039;s thought &#039;bollocks&#039; basically.<br /><br />the only part of the above i know to be 100% true is he contacted me about the lucy, the rest is conjecture, but, considering my dealings and conversations with the guy, i consider it to be pretty accurate.<br /><br />as has been stated - the fuckers minted, he&#039;s not gonna do someone out of 10k, especially if he&#039;s making far more than that a month on other shit and risking a very good vendor reputation. sorry mate but you must have really fucked him off for him to go off the rails like that

It only works if their economy sustains an annual 7%+ growth but if that doesn&#039;t happen and it&#039;s slowing down already then shit gets craaaaayzeeeeeh! Also you can&#039;t artificially sustain the value of a currency like they do indefinitely because when their miracle pops (which it will) the value will supernova. It&#039;s only valid whilst their system works but indefinite growth cannot exist like that. We thought it could and look what happened in 2008.....

Yes Joey was fucking stupid but Hoffa has zero morals and basically roped this guy along the whole time, just because Joey was silly enough to fall for it you think Hoffa deserves no blame? Wake up and smell the coffee kid, Hoffa is a scummy piece of shit, and it must suck to be a poor dole bludging centrelink&nbsp; bumming fuck that&nbsp; needs to scam others to supply his own fiendish habits. If only Hoffa had a job maybe he could supply his own habits.<br /><br />You Aussies need to sort your shit out, bunch of amateur fucks trying to socialize on this forum like you aint got no mates and giving a bad name for the rest of us. Most you cunts are as thick as a plank aswell * Joey was stupid enough to hand a random avatar 10k therefor i wont put any of the blame onto Hoffa yet i will stand by him like a good little bitch that i am*<br /><br />PS to you &#039;spam busters&#039; that removed Joeys threads/posts about this scam need to check your selves. deleting threads that mention full blown scams involving certain vendors is a bad fucking idea, how do i know that many of the vendors that i order off are not scum cunts but have had there threads removed because certain &#039;spam busters&#039; are in bed with them??<br /><br />Faggots

If you think this thread is yours then think again buddy, i now own this thread and i now own you and you boy band.<br /><br />But yes your whole little boy band are retards and Hoffa was the catalyst to have a bit of fun, you were already the laughing stock of SR, dont worry i havnt ruined your &#039;street cred&#039; hahaha

				YES YES!!! Was a fucking amazing weekend!!!!!! Shy FX came on basically as soon as I got there to the dancefloor, had a wicked skank out with the Missus n then wentr to a house party after, then just back to the gyals yard where it got REALLY messy!!! :) She can fucking keep up with me man!!! I&#039;m pretty fucking impressed with Moxy!!! Lim, thanks for gettin it out to me before the weekend, was the first time either of us had taken it but sniffed ~7mg bump and was properly taken aback by how good that drug is! I felt it had a slight NBOMe feel to it, but actually is unique in it&#039;s own right and after the second same sized bump we were fucking soooo hard and passionately that it&#039;s up there with my faves for sex on drugs!!! Big up Moxy!!!!!!!<br /><br />Shy FX were fooookin sick!!! Anyone else have a mint weekend then???&nbsp; :) 8)

				Generally you already have a relationship with them before they go into stealth and they invite you into the inner circle, where it is warm and safe and away from the crap.<br /><br />I hear overseas buys suck at the moment because of customs?

				The problem is SR is constantly being discussed on popular clearnet sites and that leads to a shitton of high school kids finding their way here; I&#039;m positive that at least 60% of these dipshits are somewhere around 15 years old. <br /><br />I&#039;ve always said one day they are going to be selling SR merch in hot topic. The one drawback to this revolution spreading is that the community will inevitably get shittier. As long as we can still buy drugs here and the ideology spreads, it&#039;s a necessary sacrifice.

				I agree, its a shame, SR just doesn&#039;t have that magic it used too. I mean its still an amazing site, obviously but I miss when it used to be a small(ish) community where people were sensible and actually knew a thing or two about drugs. Trolls/spammers/noobs were pretty much non-exsistant as people actually bothered to spend some time researching on this site and BTC. I mean shit me, it took me 6 months after I first signed up with SR to feel confident enough to place an order. Even then I still shat myself constantly for 2 days straight waiting for it to arrive.<br />Now people just seem to take this wonderful opportunity for granted and don&#039;t respect what DPR and the rest of the admins are doing, it&#039;s really sad. I have utmost respect for what they have done for us by creating this site, just a shame that then it goes down for a few days 95% of people here (mostly newbies) just go completely ape-shit causing a scene and do not appreciate what the admins are doing. <br />I really miss the chat shit group, lim, gary, gdog, moksha, shiz, knomo, RD.. etc.. you know who are you are. Wish we could someone get it back to what it used to be, but who knows.&nbsp; :(<br />I also wish SR would no longer be mentioned in the press, because as you say.. it just brings annoying kids/trolls to the site who think they know everything when in reality they are pretty much ruining the forums.

				That is true for me as well to be honest, unfortunately the only thing I have in massive quantities right now is MDMA/Pills and 2-cb and I&#039;m on a SERT drug break till new years. Got about 0.5g of coke though so I&#039;ll probably be whacking that out in some grimmey nightclub toilets friday or saturday night, classy right..<br />Gotta bit of K but giving that a bit of break for a week or two as I almost K holed the other day and I&#039;m not sure I liked it.

				Same here, I was planning something big for new years but now I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to go through with it. My favorite vendors are either MIA or no longer stock the products I want, and with the falling out of Bitinstant I haven&#039;t even been able to fund my account for the last 2 months anyway. <br /><br /><br />Really hope this is just a rough patch, Silkroad has made this one of if not the most memorable year of my life.

To be honest I&#039;ve just been living lad, getting pissed, going College, and I only do drugs once a week now :). Use to be lining up Meph and Bing like 4 days a week, but lately, I haven&#039;t been able to. I need as much of my head as possible kidda. I don&#039;t get bad hangovers from Alcohol, I feel jittery and a little groggy but thats bout it. I don&#039;t get the nausea or headaches most people get... Lucky eh? Still, I could do with cutting down. I do Bing once a week, and drink maybe 3 times a week, still a little compulsive, but fuck, I&#039;m young? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been the bar and had 6 pints of Guinness (Fucking love it) and drank a half bottle of Vodka, its at this very point in time that I&#039;m contemplating on ringing Dave for a half G of Bing. But got College tomoz. May as well call it a night.<br /><br />You should all know that I love SR &amp; our crew, but I&#039;m pretty busy lately. First time in my life I&#039;ve actually been serious about my future. But damn, I wana be a Pharmacist, time to knuckle down. But you know me, I&#039;M STILL HAVING FUN. Im already thinking about what to order for xmas! I&#039;m thinking lots of Drone, Bing, MDMA and Alcohol. <br /><br /><br />Hope you&#039;re ok lad!

				Well the Hoffa thing is a bit of a longish story but basically some kid gave him $10K OOE as they were goin in on some LSD crystal but Hoff went MIA for a bit and the kid started kickin the fuck off slaggin him on here to fuck calling him out as a scammer n all this shit....But Hoff was not scammin and he was trying to sort things out but when he came on here to find all that had been said about him he distributed the funds to a few people on SR so people would know he wasn scamming him or doin anythin for his own benefit and he gave away bare bitcoins to his mates here who were on at the time....me included. Had a big old session mate I can tell ya!! ;)<br /><br />Yeah same Soll I think everyone has gone out n got lives in the last few months!!! LOL :) Good shit.....I know some of the crew are having some great news and things happening for them so.....But yeah love the crew here but just more important shit to do IRL at the mo!!! I&#039;m still checkin in 2 or 3 times a week though....Just not every waking/spare minute of the day like I used to on here!!!! LOL ;)

No regrets man, but sooooo awkward in the morning when we woke up. Thats the worst part of any night, even when you&#039;ve pulled lol. Its so easy to pull here, need to calm down a bit.&nbsp; :-\

				Hey GT man, I&#039;m good mate! As much as I dread the long days at College, I&#039;m fine. I&#039;m pretty chilled all the time, I just do what I have to do, a lot of good people at my College. A lot of stoners like, and I don&#039;t like weed, if only they knew what MDMA and Drone feels like. Maybe in the summer I&#039;ll introduce them to my world. But till then, I&#039;ll just chill and go with the flow. You got lucky mate?? Nice! Speaking to a few girls myself, though I&#039;m just the guy they speak to for entertainment, not for anything else. Gotta lose the weight, but recently I&#039;ve been drinking more &amp; eating Snickers bars. <br /><br />Yes Pharmacy is what I want to get in to. What about you? Telling you what mate, its hard aiming for Pharmacy because its a long way away &amp; with all the drugs I&#039;ve done, I already know a lot of it. The amount of times I&#039;ve had to self medicate. Like when I over did it on Speed/Drone if I statred feeling overstimulated/panicky.. what did I do? Take Diazepam! Because believe it or not, Diazepam or any Benzo doesn&#039;t effect BP or heart rate much, so using it for&nbsp; a stim OD isn&#039;t harmful, in fact, its how people in hospitals get treated for an OD of stims. Also, in the UK, they mostly use Diamorphine (heroin) for acute pain not Morphine.<br /><br />I just love how drugs are used to make people feel better! I love the whole subject.<br /><br />Hows your life been GT? You enjoying College/Uni? <br /><br />And haha GT, fill me in kid! You couldn&#039;t get it up? Don&#039;t fucking blame you! I can&#039;t on MDMA either! Speed is another story, I&#039;m wanking like a bastard, with all these dirty thoughts in me head! Least you pull the women ey??? Though to my defense, my left arm has gotta be strong now! Exercise boys, plenty of it in my case ;). Oh and DO NOT TRY AND BASH ONE OUT ON DRONE!! You&#039;ll spend at least 2 hours trying to get on out, and even though when it does come out it feels&nbsp; FUCKING GOOD its a long process. Damn, when I orgasm on Drone its a delayed orgasm, and when it does come out, its like Christmas has come at one. WOW. <br /><br />EDIT - +1 for both of you. Had to go over a few things in my post, a little pissed... And pretty tired. Was up at 6AM today.

				Yeah, wherever there&#039;s students there&#039;s stoners lol. I&#039;ve pretty much given up weed apart from a cheeky spliff once in a while with some mates or when I&#039;m on mandy. Feel a lot better for it! Ah cool man, if you wanna get laid then go out with some quality cocaine (meph as well if you want) and get drunk. Confidence goes through the roof and bitches love confidence. ;) <br /><br />Same here, I just love knowing how they work and why they make you feel good/better. Brain chemistry / networks etc..<br /><br />Yes mate, I&#039;m fucking loving it. Haha, tried to bash a girl whilst I was rollin balls a while back, didn&#039;t go to well. Just couldn&#039;t get a boner so we just talked for hours lol. I&#039;ve bashed one out on drone + coke before, took ages to cum. <br /><br />+1 to everyone as well.

				Yeah don&#039;t worry this will be rectified. <br /><br />And when you get to your 5th line it just about peaks. You may as well keep doing 60-80mg as well for a better high. And you&#039;ll be pulling all nighters, believe me. ;)

				I don&#039;t really care where I live, I mostly want to start working my life away from money and possessions and start traveling. I&#039;d still like to earn enough to put away to collect interest while I&#039;m gone from the world to fall back on in an emergency. I could probably quit my job and rely entirely on dealing drugs at this point but I&#039;m having trouble committing to it, it&#039;s a bitch to keep stocked up on shit when you deal with psychedelics. That and I never actually have real spending money because it all goes towards bills, shipping costs, and bullshit taxes to exchange for bitcoin. :-\

				The name actually is &#039;Partyflock&#039; not party flock :P <br /><br />It&#039;s a Dutch site to keep track of parties, chatter on forums and that kind of stuff. <br /><br />Not really sure what I&#039;ll be doing with NYE, don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be much different than any other years; drink a lot, snort a lot and sleep very little ;D

				Only people I&#039;ve ever seen actually crazy strict about MDMA is the roaders. When we were younger it was normal/acceptable to take it every weekend, now we give it 2 weeks. I feel with proper pre/post loading specially being generous with the 5htp 2 weeks is plenty of time to recover<br /><br />..Also was curious what partyflock actually was. I thought it was an e pill..

				Haha, my bad.<br />Yeah my last two rolls were only spaced 2 weeks apart and I like to space it a month at least. But my last roll was probably one of my best so I&#039;m guessing mdma &#039;magic&#039; has a lot to do with set and setting rather than repeat usage, if that makes sense... Especially as MDMA is considered a psychedelic. <br />Shit that reminds me, I need to get some more 5htp!<br />

				Alright guys, whats everyone up to for xmas then? Hoffa, shiz long time no speak! <br />Pretty much had my first &#039;bad trip&#039; on friday. Got my mate to measure out the doses of 2c-b, which was of course to much (must have been 30/40mg+). I snorted this on the the peak of an mdma/ketamine high and shit got really fucking intense. At first I was enjoying it, but when my mate started freaking out proper bad and running/screaming into walls, then I didn&#039;t feel so good. The visuals were scary and I kept forgetting where I was/who I was. Plus being at a party where there were non-trippers as well weren&#039;t the best ether. I didn&#039;t exactly panic or lose my mind completely, but it wasn&#039;t a nice experience. Definitely learned a lesson from it though. Do NOT get your mates to measure out doses for you!<br />Anyway, merry xmas!

				I&#039;ve been suicidal again as of late. Given away everything in my stash for free other than a little less than half a gram of MDMA, some Ayahuasca mix, a dash of DMT, and an eighth of weed. I&#039;ve been tossing most of my personal belongings that I think are unnecessary, all technology for the most part. I&#039;ve broken off practically every friendship that meant something to me and now all I want to do is sleep. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing anymore and I almost want to reveal myself just to see what would happen. What&#039;s wrong with me? Why do I do the things I do to myself? I really want to be happy but I hurt myself on purpose out of anger despite everything. Why I&#039;m on here admitting these things that are of no importance to anyone I don&#039;t know but maybe it&#039;s a relief to have someone know what I&#039;m going through that has absolutely no comprehension at all of any of it.&nbsp; :-\

				Yea yea!! Good to see a few returning faces here!! And yes DK this place 12 months ago was foookin amazing!!!! Well, I never found it till Feb 2012 and was amazing!!! I&#039;ll never forget the immense buzz surrounding SR just before the infamous 420 sale....And how fucked it was after it!!!!<br /><br />Well, 2012 was my best drug taking year to date with the sheer choice and quality of the shit on SR. Hands down the most experimental year of my life!!!!!!!! I&#039;ve learned so much from being here, from you guys, my own research and explorations....I&#039;m a very happy drug user and much more so than I was in my pre-SR days. BIG UP TO ALL THAT MAKE SR POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!

				There will be a shitload of drugs at that festival, but be careful as most of the stuff sold at UK festivals is shit/sugar/cut. <br />Best bet is stash your drugs away on your person so that its hard for them to be found, but then again taking drugs on a plane is a huge risk especially those coming from NL.

				Fuck it Gnomes, I&#039;d take your own!! I&#039;ve took drugs across EU borders many a time with no problem. He will be searched in NL then no search in UK as is an EU passport holder.<br /><br />Just whack that down ya kegs/pants/boxers and you should be good, just don&#039;t go through the security that scans your body via wave technology. Just go for the old fashioned x-ray of ya bag and metal detector. At Schipol, they have both types of security I believe. Well they did last time I went over. They have NEVER searched my person within EU borders.<br /><br />To be honest though, at the more underground festivals, I would think you&#039;ll have no probs finding great drugs!!! Guys, lets not totally diss off the UK&#039;s supplies!!!! I get good shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And alot of what I can get local is as good as stuff on road in several drug categories. There is peng out there in the deepest depths of the UK!! ;)

				haha yeah they&#039;re cunts!!!! :D<br /><br />Bro DPR accidentally introduced a bug into the deposit processor and caused buyers putting in deposits to get repeated deposits, some received $10,000 in BTC into their accounts by mistake. Was carrying on for about 4 hours before it was spotted by admin.<br /><br />That&#039;s why the site was down for maintenance earlier, it was all being rolled back to before the incident occurred!

				ahh sheit. that makes it even better knowing they write it.&nbsp; &nbsp;i reakon the vd crew would be able to write some pretty funny shit about what we get upto in our own separate lives and then combine it all together somehow.<br />&nbsp; <br />i think the reason its so great, is cause they be keepin it fresh!... they dont follow a plot or theme, every single episode is new, different, and completely un-related to the previous one. i have only seen them carry over one plot in s02 when they had the huge party at their house.<br /><br />how about the gay TEAM FORCE JESUS WRESTLERS hahaha. oh fuck that was intense, watching two huge boofheads hook up.

				Just checking in on the club 8) .<br />Shit hit the fan in my life with my closest friend ratting on me. Got out on bail and facing some time. I think im good because they have no hard evidence of shit. Got rid of everything I had before they got me. Trying to get me for shit I did years ago.<br /><br />I recently sat down and pounded every episode of workaholics and South Park. Shits amazing. I mean they get paid to act like themselves. Now that&#039;s one of comedy centrals most popular shows. Nowadays Comedy Central has been putting some garbage on the air. Anyone see, inside amy shumar, kroll show, nathan for you, or the ben show? Literally the worst comedy I have ever seen. These people are just not funny at all. How do they get TV shows?&nbsp; I thought the jesselnik offensive was fucking great tho. I love me some fucked up humor and the way he ends every show is awesome, &quot;goodnight kids, go read a book.&quot;<br /><br />Last night I paid a hooker 50$ to give me a massage and it was the best damn massage iv ever had.<br />What&#039;s going on in everyone else&#039;s lives?<br />

				Am I still allowed to post in this thread? Lol..<br /><br />I&#039;m fucking pissed off about some feedback some fucktard left for 10 Xanax they ordered from me recently. It&#039;s a 3 of 5 rating that said &quot;Questionable quality...&quot; and said my pills &quot;weren&#039;t as good as the pills he&#039;s prescribed. He has a panic disorder so this medicine is really important apparently.&quot;<br />When I read it I thought wow, what a bunch of bullshit, what kind of panic-disorder-having human orders 10 Xanax from someone they&#039;ve never ordered from before? Don&#039;t they usually order bulk amounts? And what the fuck are you talking about, I GOT THESE FROM THE FUCKING PHARMACY YOU PIECE OF SHIT!<br /><br />Well I looked today and the feedback has been changed to:<br /><br />3 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questionable quality...Not half as potent as the pharmacy ones I&#039;ve tried. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 days<br /><br />Probably because he realized the feedback he left before sounds like total idiocy. As if he doesn&#039;t STILL look like an asshole, I mean he GOT his fucking order probably 2-3 days after placing it, I gave him excellent service and he fucking leaves me a 3 of&nbsp; 5? IS THIS REAL LIFE?<br /><br />Sorry, just wanted to vomit some hatred out of my system before I head to work. Thanks friends. :)<br /><br />xoxo<br />PM90

				Fucking hell... Just made a link to some crazy Indian kids in my area who want LSD, they asked for the strongest acid I could get my hands on and I had a few 200ug tabs left from Tessellated so I loaded them up with that, told them to start with half a tab as they were pretty strong.. turns out they all double dropped, they thought it was to weak and that back in India they manage to get tabs that are up to 800ug&#039;s each?! Do any of yous reckon thats legit? Fucking crazy bastards I&#039;m tellin ya.<br />Anyways, whats goin on peeps? <br />Hayfeaver is absolutely destroying me today the bitch, got some relief pills up at the shop and I swear there actually downers; fuck all relief and I feel like I&#039;ve taken half an Xanax minus the good feeling. <br />Good to see ya back RD.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

Weird though, especially since they all double dropped and still said it was kinda weak but good acid.&nbsp; ::)<br />Yeah you can get at any time during your life which is shit, but karma for all those who take the piss out me for sneezing 24hrs a day and up getting it lol.

				Bruv I said I wasn&#039;t saying who I am and that I have changed my style up to be more like a few other people. I never said I was RD. <br />Come on bro I though it was easier than that to figure me out. It would be easier if I could say, but I won&#039;t. Nothing against the bruvs, but my closest friends have fucked me over in the last year again and again so iv become a paranoid fuck who doesn&#039;t trust anyone. In fact because shit is finally hitting the fan for me and they are trying to stick a mandatory minimum of no less than 20 years. That means 20 years on good behavior, but can be increased. My whole life is gone. I love posting here as it gives me something to do now that I have been losing my life privileges.<br /><br />I have stopped ordering from the road because I figure they are watching my address&#039;s along with my few drops. I just had to vow off all drugs because I need to look clean when they drug test me. All my friends have fucked me and left. My life has been shattered. <br /><br />I need to leave the road because if they connect this account to me, then there is enough incriminating evidence there for them to swing past the kingpin charges and add life. I hope somehow I get out of this one, but I don&#039;t see how. The best part of this whole thing being they took all of my cash as &quot;evidence,&quot; so I can&#039;t even afford a lawyer.<br /><br />Much love to my only friends who haven&#039;t fucked me. Sorry to be like this.<br />

				Fair enough. I can&#039;t find decent coke anywhere in my area, well nothing compared to the quality I&#039;ve received from SR. Mandy is getting a bit better in my area though, saw some tanned moonrocks the other day but as its £40 a G here it works out cheaper and probably better quality from SR.

				he does look a bit of a mong don&#039;t he. <br /><br />i can see how La F&#039;s standard coke deliveries got popped, it was pretty clever, but a couple of times i was surprised it made it through - these were 7 and 14g at a time. the large orders should still get through though, if he&#039;s using the same technique that he used when he sent me 100g, it was fucking ingenious. in fact, it was put together so well i started thinking he was part of a cartel - your standard dealer just cannot get shit put together how this package was. had a whole punched in the side of the box and a couple of dog hairs in there, so customs give it a proper going over, and it still made it through. a couple of weeks after i got it customs sent me a fucking bill! twenty odd quid for importing a taxable gift!! £20 tax for 100 grams of supreme quality coke didn&#039;t seem too bad a deal so i had no qualms in paying it :D<br /><br />THANK FUCK IT&#039;S FRIDAY!!!!!! got another run tonight then i am gonna get out of my swede. anyone got plans? you can all have a +, not done that in a while

				Fairs, I do love that combo. ;) What coke you got? Local stuff?<br />Exactly what I thought, especially the area we were pulled I&#039;m surprised they didn&#039;t take it further. They were going to find the guy and ask him if he wanted to press charges but my mate was apologetic and they just let it slip, was pretty fucking funny though.

MDMA for example, just isn&#039;t viable to import that much Safrole so had to scrap it. Life is an uphill struggle, but with the LSD there is no hindrances like that.

				Damn just blew like £100 on koltbiz&#039;s stuff, plus I just remembered I have that 8ball on the way.. Really want to try yours though haha.<br />Jheez must be some potent stuff, seeing as 100mg of around ~40% pure gives me hardly any euphoria. <br />Best coke I&#039;ve had so far was from Budworx though, 100mg of that had me BUZZING. Literally can&#039;t wait to try Koltbiz&#039;s stuff as it can only be better. ::)

I remember some months ago you were following PrincessHIGH around like a bad smell and posting after her on the threads she posted on, apparently hoping to get somewhere with your affections for her. When she didn’t return the same feelings you whimpered off, appearing every now and again to intermittently pop on a thread she has posted on to say hello to her. She became busy with bitcoin vending Lim, more than that though, she doesn’t date little boys with small tools saying that they’re “gangster no.1” so just get over it. Being a sad, moaning little kid, you then went around saying that you had seen her private parts. You haven’t. PrincessHIGH won’t dignify that b/c it is a little kid typing away at a keyboard instead of vending who everyone has gotten to know as some shit-talker. Lol, “ganster”. You’re a nobody on the forums and you are a nobody on the marketplace. Go find out what 4-MMC is, what money laundering entails, and the security gear you pretend to have, and come back and try again. <br /><br />And stop crying over the fact that PrincessHIGH wasn’t interest in you when you tried to be more than friends earlier this year and pretending you have seen her bits in retaliation, b/c it’s just proving how much of a crying little bitch you are. In fact, I haven’t seen any post from you recently that hasn’t involved your tears over PrincessHIGH. Go work on your failed vending instead of coming on here every day to moan.<br /><br />Oh, and work on your come backs kid. You make yourself look like a fag who’s never been laid, and who’s got nothing to do but talk shit on a forum and dream of how much they wannabe Scarface. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I know that feel. Luckily, I&#039;ve got a good brick of dope left for myself. I&#039;m waiting on others, because I don&#039;t dope up daily (for obvious reasons), but I&#039;ve got weed. Still, weed is never enough, it&#039;s just a good relaxtion tool. Besides Crohn&#039;s, I use it for the same reason people smoke cigarettes for. Relaxing and calming down.<br /><br />I just want my MXE and DMT. Ahhhhh. Sobriety is terrible. I don&#039;t like this reality; I love to change it and live in a unique world for a time. Psychedelics are some of the best drugs out there, and opiates are just candy. Yum. Pain relief = golden.

				Whenever I&#039;m waiting for drugs the week ALWAYS goes by slowly. Inches by. It sucks when you run out of the non-addictives, because you want to use your addictives (aka heroin) constantly to fill that urge to intoxicate, but you stop yourself because of how addicting it is.<br /><br />So it sucks. LSD is just a different conscienceness and I love that. If I could LIVE in a trip, I would be so happy. The K-hole is one of my favorite states. So super excited for MXE.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about weed making you paranoid though. :( I smoke ounces and ounces every month. I don&#039;t really get high anymore, I don&#039;t care. I just like the act. Habit, I guess. Plus it helps with pain. I&#039;ve only been paranoid on weed once. My first time.<br /><br /><br />&quot;THEY KNOWWWWW.&quot;

				If I tried coke or meth, I would be climbing the walls. I can&#039;t even IMAGINE using it. You should see me on OXYCODONE. Even THAT is activating to me (yes, it&#039;s far more energizing than morphine-based opiates, but it&#039;s still an opiate). One sip of coffee and I&#039;m up for days. Caffeine, stimulants, all of that, destroys me. Even SUGAR. (And I LOVE taffy... obviously).<br /><br />I would love to try coke, but no. Never. I&#039;d rather try meth because I prefer smoking though. Still, I have a meth pipe, I just use it for DMT. <br /><br />Downers. I love them. Even benzos. They don&#039;t help me sleep, but I&#039;ve taken upwards of 1g of diazepam and I&#039;ve never been more relaxed (except on heroin, clearly).<br /><br />Tell me, what does coke do for you? I&#039;m incredibly curious.

				ever done speed? well decent coke it nothing like it, despite people calling it &#039;poor mans coke&#039;. decent coke is a real subtle buzz, you do a line and you&#039;re sat there for the 1st 10 minutes thinking &#039;man i&#039;ve been robbed&#039; then another 5, 10 minutes later when you&#039;ve forgotten all about it you&#039;ll catch yourself in a proper in depth conversation with anybody, whether you know them or not, and you have something to say on ANY subject, even shit you know nothing about, and you just feel like the MAN, it is TOTAL confidence in powdered form. a lot of people say it makes you arrogant - proper coke doesn&#039;t, it just makes you supremely confident in yourself. cut coke can and does make you arrogant, had plenty of that shit and got into a lot of arguments because of it, but the really decent stuff gives you more empathy, so you can relate to what people are saying to you rather than just fucking their opinions off and laying down your own. proper coke makes you funnier to other people, whereas cut coke just makes you think you&#039;re funny while others think you&#039;re a bit of a nob. it is my DoC without a doubt, but it&#039;s so hard to find proper coke, hence me completely clucking after KB, and in general preferring mandy. you can sleep pretty easy a couple of hours after your last line as well if it&#039;s not cut.<br /><br />don&#039;t like speed at all, tried meth once and have a scar on my face as a reminder that i don&#039;t like that either.<br /><br />do like a valium just to mong out on the couch on a sunday, they&#039;re really nice the day after a pill. do like H as well, but have zero self control when it&#039;s in the house - i did write a thread about it &#039;if you&#039;re thinking of trying heroin...&#039; on here somewhere

				Haha, I&#039;m far beyond the &quot;thinking of trying heroin&quot; phase. I might write one of those guides myself, to be honest, except from a different perspective...<br /><br />I&#039;ve done speed once. I was up for... I don&#039;t know. 9 days? Never again. How you&#039;re referring to coke makes me want to try it VERY badly, but there&#039;s no way. I would screw myself. I would die from exhaustion. My body HATES stimulants, because it&#039;s already so monstrously stimulated to begin with. That&#039;s why I love downers.<br /><br />My drug of choice is DMT, simply because I can use it more frequently, it doesn&#039;t last too long so I can use it quickly before going out or something, and it&#039;s not addicting like heroin is. <br /><br />If I could use heroin nonstop without killing myself, however, I would. <br /><br />ALTHOUGHHHH!!!!! Injecting dillies is something I like to treat myself to once in a blue moon. THAT is my favorite thing ever. Ah man, coke sounds so great. I&#039;m very jealous of you. (But then again, you may be jealous that I have complete control over my heroin use :P )

				fuck man, 9 days?? if i don&#039;t get 7 - 8 hours sleep every night i&#039;m a right miserable cunt. <br /><br />never done dillies. never injected anything, i used to snort H. there was a guy on here a while ago, Nucleo, shipping #4 from Thailand - that was something like 90%+ pure. one match head bump of that up the hooter got me proper nodding. thought fuck it, if i&#039;m gonna try it i might as well try the best. did a speedball with that and some triple washed coke - that was fucking awesome, did it a few weeks running then started to get real bad chest pains so thought i better knock that on the head.<br /><br />yeah i do miss H, i left it for a bit then got another half g to see if i could control it, and after 2 days i was straight bang on it again, so fuck it, stick to the coke - i can control that pretty easy, i can go for a couple of beers after work, have a line or 2, then go home and cook dinner and chill with the mrs and not even cluck for another line. i was selling it and had quite a habit back in the day, so thats probably how i can control it now

				Yeah, that&#039;s pretty impressive. Coke is so addicting, simply because the come down is shit. But it seems you&#039;re taking super clean and pure coke, so I bet the come down is way better. <br /><br />Does a valium help with the come down?<br /><br />And yeah, 9 days. The most, without drugs, I&#039;ve styed awake is 8 days. I have the worst insomnia case I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s miserable and hellish. I&#039;m testing GHB right now (once it comes in) for sleep. Right now, I will use heroin for my &quot;third day of the week&quot; just so I can get a few hours of sleep in. The heroin I&#039;ve got now is banging, but I&#039;ve had better. The bags are also very light (and a couple were almost completely empty, it&#039;s depressing). Quality is great though, and he made up by throwing in lots of extra bags. Still not as much as I should&#039;ve got, but the price and quality make it worth it. <br /><br />I would pay a premium for 90%+ pure #4 though. A match sized bump... When I insufflate, I usually bump at least .15g. I have a very high natural opiate tolerance though. A nice .15g bump of the heroin I have now can even knock me out if I let it. I can fight falling asleep and just get nods, but damn, I love the fact that potent opiates knock me out (diacetylmorphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone). Oxycodone is wonderful because it desn&#039;t make me sleepy in the least, so if I&#039;m not wanting to nod, but I want a great opiate high, I&#039;ll take oxycodone. Not often though, simply because of the price and I prefer the nod that heroin gives.<br /><br />If you can barely handle insufflation of heroin, if you bang it, you&#039;ll be gone. Don&#039;t do it ever. Stick to insufflating every once in a while. Avoid the needle at all costs. I do it for price reasons and the fact that I have severe pain, and I&#039;m able to control it... at least thus far. If I ever feel myself slipping though, I will simply sell my stash. I refuse to slip into the realm of a &quot;stereotypical junkie.&quot;<br /><br />Nobody knows I use drugs in real life, except marijuana. Nobody. (I have a lot of naloxone. I refuse to go to an ER if I OD. I will just dose myself with naloxone until it&#039;s gone from my system. Better safe than sorry, and I CANNOT be caught using heroin).

				there is no comedown with proper coke, and for me a little line, probably less than .1 keeps me chatting for a good few hours, but it&#039;s a relaxed buzz, nothing like a rush, so it&#039;s possible to sleep on it. its the cut stuff thats more-ish and fucks up your sleeping pattern, the good gear you can just forget about it completely after a line. IME, and seeing my mates, coke is only addictive if you&#039;ve got it - if you don&#039;t have it it just doesn&#039;t bother you. seems to be like that for all my mates<br /><br />my whole family knows about the coke, mandy and pot but the mrs would leave me if she knew i tried H. couldn&#039;t give a fuck about what other people know about me - &#039;who the fuck are you to judge me&#039; kind of thing, so i&#039;m quite happy wondering arouns supermarkets stoned out of my box with glowing red eyes<br /><br />nah staying away from h, and if i ever tried injecting anything i&#039;d probably pump myself full of air bubbles, so fuck that for a game of soldiers.<br /><br />someone bad mouthed Nucleo so he fucked off, but if you back in the H vendors thread you&#039;ll see everyone loved his shit. quarter g cost me 50 notes though.<br /><br />like the sound of oxy, but it looks a bit on the expensive side.<br /><br />how did you get hold of anything if no one knows you do anything? before SR i mean

				Clearnet dealings with proxies and local drop locations. People know I smoke weed. That&#039;s it. I have a medical card for that. I smoke constantly, so if they didn&#039;t know, it&#039;d be hilarious. I don&#039;t hide my paraphernalia either; no need to since I have a card. <br /><br />Man, if I didn&#039;t already have stupidly large sleep issues, I might just buy a quater gram of nice coke. Maybe I will anyway. Is there any vender up at the moment that is worth it, or should I just wait for someone else? <br /><br />It&#039;s too bad that the wife would leave you for heroin use. The only person who knows about my heroin use has never met me in real life. We&#039;re friends on the clearnet, but we live on opposite sides of the globe. <br /><br />No comedown with proper coke, eh... Damn. It inrerests me so much. If I do get it, how much of a line do you think I should test, considering my INSANELY low tolerance to all things stimulating? (Even LSD. I won&#039;t sleep for a long time after using it, sometimes up to a week. But SO worth it. I fucking LOVEEEEEE LSD).

				I can&#039;t sleep on lucy, I don&#039;t know anyone who can. But I mean afterwards. If I get a gram from someone I&#039;ll just do a line... or maybe all of it if I like it, eventually... and never buy it again. Who knows. The only reason why I want a tester pack is because I&#039;d rather spend a couple hundred on heroin instead, haha. When and if I test it, I&#039;ll let you know how it went though. Thank you for the dosing directions as well. <br /><br />Enjoy your meal. I&#039;m going to go grind up some more bud.

Sat on the table right in front of me now. ;) Bring on the weekend. <br />RD have you tried a line of decent cocaine mixed with a line of Mephedrone? Meph ain&#039;t the best drug in the world (no offense lim lol.), seen to many people fuck they&#039;re bodies/heart up on it. But I save it for when there&#039;s good coke about. The rush you get from the mix is orgasmic lol.

Sorry, you’re a little tiny if you know what I mean. How intelligent is it to troll someone when you have been dOx’d Lim? Are you really that dumb? Or just plain nawty? Er, the only female bits you’ve seen are the ones hanging off your mum and I’m guessing that is a real sight for sore eyes, if she gave birth to you then she must look like you, and if she looks like you she may have had to drug someone in order to agree to it. Lol, gangsta. Er… who’s idea was it to put that on a weedy little runt’s profile?<br /><br />So many tears shed by you Lim on this thread. Sorry PrincessHIGH was not interested in you sport, didn’t realise it would actually do your head in to this extent. Trust me, you haven’t seen PrincessHIGH, if this is all you can come up with after you finally realised she wasn’t into you, the claim that you have seen her naked, well, I feel sorry for you. No one on this forum gives a shit on anything you write as it immediately loses all credibility as soon as they see who posted it. <br /><br />I also find it amusing you think I’m her “boy-toy” b/c I merely stood up for her. Does this mean you are Geedog’s boytoy b/c you stood up for him? Your logic is fucked. Your posts are fucked. Your vending is fucked (check out your feedback). And your sex life is fucked. <br /><br />Go invest in a sex doll and stop crying like a little fag, b/c those of us who have seen you will confirm you’re NOTHING like a gansta. You’re a weed who can’t get laid, who had feelings for Princess that weren’t returned, and this teen outburst is the result of that.<br /><br />Until next time tryhard. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

You ran your mouth and gave them likability.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />for a start lets get it straight that the only reason i am entertaining your gay little argument is because i&#039;m bored:<br /><br />i &quot;got myself arrested&quot; because one of my dealers grassed me up. if you read a bit more of that thread you will have seen i said Silk Road was not mentioned.<br /><br />that kills points 2 &amp; 3. <br /><br />point 4 - guys dealing in hundreds of kilos of coke are a damn sight more gangster than you&#039;ll ever be. no they are not the mafia, but not all gangs are part of cosa nostra. you&#039;ll understand that when you get out of your mums spare room and into the real world.<br /><br />5. diary? i come here and chat bollocks if i&#039;m sober or wasted - this is an anonymous forum, you think i&#039;m the only one here getting wasted most nights of the week? how does this incriminate anyone i speak to, deal with, or sell to?<br /><br />6. i&#039;ve got no comeback apart from the fact you are a total twat. so i said i work in an office? so i said one of my dealers got busted? so i said i&#039;ve actually bought anything from SR? you believe everything you read, you sir are a bigger dickhead than me!<br /><br />as i said before - get your facts straight before you barge in where you&#039;re not wanted and shoot that dartford tunnel of a mouth off. TWAT<br />

				Yo RD. Shit man, hangover? ;) <br />Yeah it was pretty good, I would give it a high 7/10. (10/10 being the best I&#039;ve ever had, and 1/10 being shit) it came MBB&#039;d, pretty hidden and sealed. If you&#039;ve ever received from Symbiosis it&#039;s pretty comparable to that...<br />Plus, the cocaine is pretty damn amazing, almost on par with Koltbiz&#039;s purified!

				just the one to check out - if it was all good was gonna go bulk again like La F. think i&#039;ll give WD a go if/when this one turns up - i know it&#039;s the postal system at fault rather than KB but it&#039;s still a ridiculous turnaround to make any dollar on it. perhaps you got a decent mail worker dealing with your post and i got some cunt that still isn&#039;t over the falklands<br /><br />did they say what caused his balls to balloon like that?

				I really dunno, he said it was the most amount of pain he&#039;s even been in. Can you imagine the load he would blow in your face? <br />Creamfields looks sick to be fair, few friends went last year but they got sent home a day early or something because of the rain.. How wank is that. Haha camping is part of the fun! Apart from when you&#039;re on a horrific comedown and running low on drugs lol.. But I won&#039;t have that problem this year. 8)

				Damn man, I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll turn up at some point. If it makes you feel any better; a review for WhiteDreams gear came in earlier which was far more detailed than mine, you can check it out in his thread if you&#039;re thinking ordering from him. :)<br />But also I saw a review on the cocaine reviews thread that good old Limmylimetless is sending out coke samples with his Meph, Is this true Lim? The guy said it was pretty much straight from coca leaf synth quality. Need to start saving my coins lol. ;)

I love house because it sounds so good when you&#039;re on it as well lol. Check out artists like Karma Kid, Tensnake, Dusky and even Skream&#039;s new stuff is like a house/ disco genre mix which I&#039;m loving also. <br /><br />Also, anyone know whats happened to Lim? Haven&#039;t heard from him in a while and all his listings are down..

				Hello everyone, sorry I haven&#039;t been around as much. <br /><br />Basically I did a line of what I thought was blow, ket and MD at a party but some prick gave me a hot dose and put a lot of H in it which is why I haven&#039;t been about for a while. I&#039;m not going to talk about it too much for anonymity reasons but it was a very close run thing.

				fucking hell mate!<br />Hope you&#039;re all alright now.. can&#039;t believe some cunt would do that he needs sorting out. Makes me want to be even more cautious with what I&#039;m whacking up my nose. Something similar happened to me where I got someone to sort me out a line of 2cb and this idiot had no idea what he was doing even though he insisted he did. So anyway I railed the line which I thought was only gunna be about 10mg&#039;s, turned out it was about 50mg+, had a horrific time. But fuck me, H is 10 times worse. Wishing you a speedy recovery mate.

Was well impressed to get a new hook up at 5am monday night for £180 and is fucking good stuff!! a girl i pulled sorted it...snaked his number innit! ;)<br /><br />I was under the impression Lim was chucking out some samples for the boys as he said earlier in thread, not to buy a £100 gram! that aint no sample!! lol<br /><br />Bristol Friday then Jungle Gathering in birmz Saturday!

				it&#039;s probably always worth washing it unless it hits you like it should ;) if you can get any chloroform that gets rid of speed and ephedrine, but i&#039;ll be damned if i know where to get any of that from!<br /><br />bit of a problem is coke is completely soluble in chloroform so you need to do it properly. quite good destructions here - http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/193299-How-to-clean-up-adulterated-cocaine

Last weekend I watched a lightsabre appear out of someones cup at lovebox, but had a bit of MDA as well. Love the MDA trippyness lol.<br />Ha I wish I had the self discipline to break for that long from it. Doing it 1 or 2 times a month I guess.. but usually only have about 200mg spread over the night when I do.<br /><br />Fuck shiz! 27 is hot, its pissing it down with rain here. think the UK has had its summer already

				i&#039;ve got to leave it that long because i really go for it when i do hit it. used to do it every friday and saturday every weekend, got to the point where i needed 9 or 10 pills for a decent buzz, then proper snappy and ratty during the week, really emotional over fuck all. enough is enough - if it&#039;s only every 6 months i can go crazy and just be spun out the next day, no crying while i&#039;m watching the magic roundabout or stupid shit like that later on in the week.<br /><br />not done MDA, well not that i&#039;m aware of anyway, might have had some in some pills back in the days, but weren&#039;t aware of it

				Lol yeah I was like that on my last comedown last sat, but that was MDMA, MDA, a bit of meth and cocaine . Started getting emotional watching people getting married on the Monday and then almost had a full blown panic attack on tuesday when I woke up,nothing that a bit of 5htp and a fuck load of vitamins don&#039;t fix up though. Mixing meth with MDMA makes the comedown sooo much worse.Probably not gunna do it again unless I need to stay up raving for 12+hrs lol <br /><br />Wtf shiz, never had MDPV and by the sounds of things I don&#039;t want too... Isn&#039;t the dosage a lot smaller than Meph? Some poor fucker is gunna rack up .1 and have a horrendous time. What a belllend.<br /><br />Damn knomo thats niceeee.

				<br />I&#039;ve always found that it&#039;s best to take MD first and then the Meph. Taking Meph first ruins the MD for me but the MD doesn&#039;t ruin the Meph... I think this is due to the fact that like Coke, Meph acts on dopamine quite a bit, whereas MDMA acts mostly on just serotonin. But I hope you&#039;re having a good night! :)<br /><br />Whats up anyway fellas?

				How was it coming off the H Geedogg? That stuff is bloody amazing/evil at the same time... I remember Duke&#039;s thread on it... I tired it twice and loved it, probably would have took it more if it wasn&#039;t for the fact that my true passion is Stims... mainly Meph as you all know ;). <br /><br />Wow, the price of Bitcoin now??? What the fuck.. lol! I remember when they were £3.50! If only I&#039;d have invested in a couple thousand of coins back then ;).

				Geedogg, respect right there bro! You must have the will power of a god!! Did you shoot H or just smoke/snort? As nice as I found it, I only took it nasally so I do not know how the &#039;rush&#039; feels... <br /><br />Yeah duke I&#039;ve heard loads of stories about tuesday blue&#039;s, it sounds horrible! I&#039;ve never experienced it, this is most likely because I haven&#039;t done MDMA loads and loads of times... I&#039;ve done it a lot, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve done it enough to give me that sort of &#039;hangover&#039;. <br /><br />The fact you weren&#039;t keen on Meph is complete proof of how drugs effect us all differently.. I honestly love Meph and the Meph/M1 combo is almost unbearably euphoric for me.. I&#039;ve never found MDMA to be that euphoric, maybe a 6/10 on the scale. I would say though MDMA is the overall better drug, it&#039;s not as fiendish as Meph and not as stimulating which makes it a better option for an overall easier night. I honestly get proper gutted when I run out of Meph haha.. whereas MDMA is a nice slow comedown and most of all I can still sleep that night. Yeah Meph ruins your nose, I&#039;ve always recommended bombing 200mgs of it so you get the duration advantage of taking it orally. Then after that just snort 50mg top ups or so. Still, it can temporarily ruin your nose, but not as much.<br /><br />What are you all up to today anyway?

				i&#039;ve done stupid amounts of MD mate, at one point it took 9 or 10 pills to get a decent buzz. thats when the suicide tuesdays started hitting me. was young and stupid - i find something i like doing and i whup the arse out of it for a good few years. most of my late teens - early 20s i was knee deep in pussy. weren&#039;t even birds i fancied a lot of the time, just any holes a goal type of thing. a lot of dippy birds. always been like that, developed a hefty coke habit due to it. managed to sidestep a serious H problem. just.<br /><br />MD&#039;s the best IMO feeling wise - don&#039;t give a shit if i&#039;m out partying, indoors partying, or just on my own. fucking love coming up. meph just made me feel rank.<br /><br />i&#039;m working hard mate ;) what you doing?

				Was it you who once said they necked 5 pills at once to try and get that initial first roll feeling? I&#039;ve found Weed with MDMA to be nice - increases the physical euphoria massively.. it&#039;s the only time I like Weed to be honest... That&#039;s not a bad way to be mate! I wish I was knee deep in pussy at the moment! Yeah coke is nice, especially with alcohol.. and since I discovered SR, this has been more the case. SR quality Coke + Alcohol = Win. <br /><br />Coming up on MD is great... Do you ever get eye wiggles? I got them like mad from Ivory&#039;s MDMA, I do not know if he&#039;s still around - this shows how long it&#039;s been since I&#039;ve been active. I&#039;ve thrown up on the MDMA come up before - But it was awesome... it&#039;s a sign of being on your way to a good roll and yet again it was on Ivorys MDMA! That stuff was great, the best MDMA I&#039;ve had.<br /><br />I&#039;m all about Meph though and I&#039;m going to order some tomorrow ready for the weekend! <br /><br />And nothing mate... I&#039;ve got no drugs at the moment and I&#039;m contemplating going to the shop and getting a bottle of spirits, probably Jagermeister.&nbsp; Do you reckon I should?

				i&#039;ve done 7 at once before to try get the first come up. necked half a gram of mandy at once for a bet as well. not proud of it, i can be a bit of a twat at times. <br /><br />i am proud of my late teens, early 20s phase though :) settled down now. with a proper nymph though :D, so don&#039;t need to worry about my cock falling off any more, and no more cotton buds down the japs eye at the GUM clinic every 6 months &#039;just to make sure&#039;. fucking size of those cotton buds would put most people off fucking around as well, looks about 3 times the size of a q-tip and feels about the size of a fucking elephant when they use it :o<br /><br />yes mate, you hit the nail on the head - MD &amp; pot - awesome. coke and booze - awesome :D<br /><br />coming up is the best part of MD IMO, that&#039;s why i get through so much of it - soon as i&#039;m up i do more to come up again. never had ivorys mandy, i get mine of symbiosis - that&#039;s bloody good gear. yeah i get eye wiggles. chew the fuck out of my tongue as well. only time i&#039;ve proper hallucinated was on mandy as well, saw a mate sat at the end of my bed. that was fucked up, i actually had to put my foot through him to realise he wasn&#039;t there.<br /><br />i&#039;m more of a whisky man myself, but if jager floats your boat go for it mate. decent whisky mind you - stick your bells and your jack D up your arse

				Bitches...<br />Sol, long time no speak! Still yet to try that Meph and M1 combo, will have a go with that when I&#039;m back.<br /><br />Currently having downtime (literally) on this holiday, I fear I may have over done it the first few days so we&#039;re all having a night off. I have never had a night off on a holiday before, too much fucked up shit I can barely remember but all fun and games. So glad there&#039;s internet access here or I would&#039;ve been driven crazy tonight.<br />How&#039;s eveyones week going? Anyone hittin up boomtown this weekend? Kinda wish I was around for that.

				The Meph and M1 combo is almost unbearable mate... it&#039;s so nice. Bomb the M1 and snort the Meph, M1 is best orally IMO... Plus it has a nasty ass drip like MD lol. (Though not quite as bad as MD, I&#039;ve actually vomited from the MD drip before lol) M1 is a good little drug... It is similar to MDMA but it has a different magic.. it makes me feel like a kid again. But yeah try the combo when you get chance you won&#039;t regret it. I&#039;m still meaning to try the Coke + Meph combo that you and Lim both described as a full body orgasm. That is on the agenda.<br /><br />Yeah mate long time no speak, how has life been in general bro?

				Whats a good dose for the m1 in the meph &amp; m1 mix? I have a gram bag at home which I kinda forgot about but will have a go with it soon :)<br /><br />MD is my fav, I think it will always be haha can&#039;t beat the times you have with mandy. ;) <br />It&#039;s a bit mental at the moment, managed to K hole in a club last night (my 1st ever khole..), along with another mate who also K holed. Some potent ass K they have here. Tricked as both as the first night we got K from the same guy which wasn&#039;t even half as potent. But thank fuck my other mate looked after us lol or I could&#039;ve have lost my anal virginity. Also pretty sure I was PMA&#039;d on the 1st night, skatty as fuck pill. Made me spew my guts all over the beach party. Overall a &#039;bangin&#039; holiday so far though ;) think we all needed a break tonight though. Never felt so rough in my entire life as I did earlier. <br />Yeah cocaine and meph is a solid combo... Make sure that you have good cocaine though. Very nice...

				As always it depends on how intense you want it to be ;). I would say for a solid experience bomb 180mgs of M1 and do a 100mg line of Meph as you&#039;re coming up on the M1.. The rush is intense. Lim advised me that it was good to train track them but I&#039;ve always found M1 to be better taken orally...&nbsp; &nbsp;M1 being less effective nasally is just my experience, though I&#039;ve read elsewhere that&#039;s the case as well. Have you ever tried bombing Meph? I&#039;ve always been a fan of bombing some Meph and then having a line whilst I wait for the oral dose to hit me... IMO this gives you the duration benefit of taking it orally, and the nasal benefit of a better rush + more intense experience. I do about 50mg top ups nasally after the initial doses. <br /><br />Ahh that&#039;s where I&#039;d have to disagree, Ive always found Meph to be much more euphoric.. but equally I&#039;ve found that MD is the safest bet in terms of its no where near as fiendish and makes for an overall nice experience. <br /><br />Haha first ever K hole in a club? How was it? Where did you travel to? haha.. I remember my first K Hole vaguely but I&#039;ve never been able to remember in any sort of detail exactly what I experienced. <br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely try that combo mate. I&#039;ll make a night of it soon.

				Mmm think I will bomb around 150mg as I&#039;ve never actually done M1 before and see where that takes me. Yeah I&#039;ve bombed meph once, wasn&#039;t as in intense or as stimulating as snorting, gave more of a &#039;niceynicey&#039; feeling rather than wanting to fuck and chat up everything in sight lol. <br />Depends on set and setting for me, if it&#039;s a small group of friends having a chill night in with some banging music, MDMA over meph hands down. Can&#039;t beat those nights IMO lol. I&#039;d also prefer MDMA at a festival or rave.<br />Meph I guess would be better for me somewhere I&#039;m not as comfortable, say a big house party where I don&#039;t know everyone or something.. <br /><br />Tbf I don&#039;t think anything will beat the euphoria of the first few times on MDMA. I wish I could get those feelings back and stay like it forever.. oh the happiness. <br /><br />Literally don&#039;t remember mate, Had about 6 drinks before doing the line next thing I know I feel like I&#039;m waking up from a weird ass dream I don&#039;t even remember next to my mate feeling extremely sick. Proper fucked me haha.

				Sounds like a good plan mate. Let me know what you think of the combo. Yeah it&#039;s more chilled out when bombed, yeah bloody hell Meph makes you horny as fuck doesn&#039;t it? And chatty as fuck as well. MDMA is quite relaxing in a way, I find that it gives me a slight groggy feeling in fact, I still wana bust my moves but I don&#039;t feel really stimulated.. <br /><br />Haha well at least you&#039;ve holed ;) The first time I holed was when I did a Meph/K combo.. well I did the Meph and as I was coming down I switched to Ket because I&#039;d ran out of Meph.. I did 20mg bumps for a while but eventually thought fuck it and did a line and away I was!<br /><br />I hope you resume your partying soon and let us know how its going pal!

				2C-B and MDMA is an excellent combo! I loved the visuals from 2C-B! They&#039;re strong though, I was tripping balls.

				4-MEC isn&#039;t too bad... it&#039;s just not as euphoric IMO. I&#039;ll probably just get some of that and mix it with some M1, that should do me. But damn actual 4-MMC and M1 is amazing.. never felt so alive! Lol. Wertu&#039;s stuff is meant to be nice but it&#039;s probably a mix of different Cathinones, but if it feels good then I&#039;m all for it. Oh I just love Cathinones. <br /><br />No probs Moks, if there isn&#039;t any 4-MMC you might as well get 4-MEC, but it annoys me how it&#039;s passed as Meph.. it&#039;s ripping people off tbh.

				Yeah I&#039;m pretty sure it was printed label, or I would&#039;ve remembered and left a review saying for him to change it pronto lol.

I STILL have to try this combo lol.<br />And nah haven&#039;t tried DMT, I want to though but I did saliva once and it kinda put me off it for while.

				Yeah I bombed the M1, it isn&#039;t very active when snorted... You can still feel it but it really isn&#039;t as strong + the drip is disgusting (Not quite as bad as MDMA though). It is an amazing combo to be fair, though the Coke + Meph combo sounds insane also!

				Mostly mandy that I get from SR although I do have a few androids, deqons and other pills that I might whack out. Haven&#039;t rolled in few months and have been saving it for next week so it should be alright :) I usually stick to around 300mg a night depending on what we&#039;re doing. Haha thanks bro have a +1 back!<br /><br />Edit : any of yous done mescaline? It&#039;s gunna be my next order. Looks like a load of fun and rather introspective.

				Sounds good mate, are the androids good? Yeah tbh, I don&#039;t find MD that fiendish, that&#039;s the one way that its superior to Meph IMO. But nonetheless, a gram of molly is hard to hold on to for a long time haha. How is it for you rolling twice in a week? I&#039;d have thought it was hard, I&#039;ve tried it before and found the second roll wasn&#039;t nearly as good. <br /><br />cheers for that mate.

				Yeah those androids are really good! My friend and I *stupidly* took a whole one and both were completely floored. A cuddly mess on the sofa for about 3 hours haha. <br />Not really done it twice in one week before, I usually leave it 2-4 weeks. The closest I&#039;ve done it apart was one weekend after the other. Just didn&#039;t last as long and the peak wasn&#039;t as strong. Comedown is the same really, I only ever get serious comedowns when I start mixing it with other things like meth or a load of MDA lol.

				I&#039;m gonna get some of them now then! Sounds amazing... they&#039;re actually that strong? Damn man... sounds immense! <br /><br />I hope you have a fun week mate. And remember, M1 + Meph is a killer:)

				Yeah if you&#039;ve had the yellow ferraris they&#039;re quite comparable to that! Slightly stronger then the blue defqons that were around a while ago. Ah when I said next week I meant not this week coming, the week after that haha my bad.

				So who&#039;s ready to try Gary Oak&#039;s LSD soon? I finally worked out a large enough investor and found a connect to a west coast chemist and my god is this stuff potent!! ^-^ We&#039;re pulling off DMT extractions and are planning on extracting up to 90 grams in the next month and preparations are underway for various mushrooms and several high times cannabis cup winning strains from seeds we got from the actual cup so look forward to me opening up shop friends, business will be booming! ;D

				Well guys, looks like this may very well be the end of SR. :(<br />Gdog, shiz, limetless (if you&#039;re still around), moksha, RD, kingdisco, garyO and all the others part of that original crew (you know who you are), you&#039;re all absolute fucking legends. I hope this is not the end, even so we can still stay in contact via that group chat and BMR/SM and whatever else will come up. Hopefully these forums will stay around as well!<br />fuck the LE, bunch of jobworth cunts when it comes to drugs.

				Never thought I&#039;d see the day mate. :( Just hoping to fuck another one of the admins still has access to the servers and can bring them back up again. <br /><br />Sheepmarket http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion/market/<br />BMR http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion<br /><br />apparently there is a &#039;deepbay&#039; as well but I&#039;m not to sure on the link of that one. Just signed onto our IRC chat btw<br /><br />Yeah Knomo, apparently the same seizure message was displayed for the forums as well earlier today, but then access was resumed as normal. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the actual SR obviously :(
