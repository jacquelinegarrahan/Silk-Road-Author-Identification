				I don&#039;t understand these fool why do they add all these so called friends to all their personal shit. Maybe some do have 1000s of friends, or just want the attention.

				I don&#039;t care what they do with their time. They can have a billion &quot;friends&quot; I just wonder why. When you can&#039;t understand something why is it such a big deal to ask someone. If I wanted to care then I can.

				Some people think it makes them cool, and that others will think they are the shit, the more friends they have the more &quot;popular&quot; they appear.&nbsp; I just see them as desperate for attention.<br />Really, you can&#039;t have any more than 20 friends that are 100% trustworthy, good friends, and only like 2-5 that you can be close with.&nbsp; There&#039;s only so much time in the day to get to know people.<br />This doesn&#039;t include family.<br /><br />Think about how much time and effort it takes to make a basic relationship with a member of the opposite sex.<br />Close friends need about the same time and almost as much effort to be worthwhile.<br />I&#039;m not saying buy them flowers, but you might take them to a movie or play some ball.<br />

				That&#039;s what I don&#039;t understand most people only have like 4-5 real friends and maybe 40-60 people that they could say &quot;hi&quot; to in the street if they saw them. So where did they 1000&#039;s of Friends come from?

				Some of these people will be artists, musicians, freelance whatever&#039;s and use facebook for networking. <br /><br />Some aren&#039;t and they&#039;re just pathetic for adding everyone they see.

				Would it make you happier if it said &quot;acquaintances&quot;?&nbsp; I have 1800+ &quot;friends&quot; and yes most of them are not close friends but sometimes it&#039;s good to keep in contact with people.&nbsp; Plus it&#039;s work to get rid of people one-by-one.&nbsp; Facebook also quite literally helps me match someone&#039;s face with their actual name.&nbsp; If it weren&#039;t for Facebook I would have forgotten a lot of people&#039;s names, which can always be a little embarrassing.<br /><br />It certainly seems like hot chicks can get a shit ton of friends because guys want to see their photos and whatnot.&nbsp; If someone utilizes FB and went to college they can usually amass quite a lot of &quot;friends&quot;.&nbsp; I suppose this also comes in handy if you were ever advertising for your start-up / business as well since your posts would reach more people.

				I had about 1500+ friends before I deleted Facebook altogether. I started getting into crypto-anarchy and became more concerned about my privacy and decided to make sure there was no information or photos whatsoever about me anywhere on the internet.<br /><br />Honestly to me the whole point of Facebook was just to make it easier to bang girls in my social network, and to see who was out clubbing and what events were on when I was heading out. I have a ton of acquaintances that I&#039;ve met through several years of intense partying when I was younger and a small amount of close friends, so I just didn&#039;t put anything personal on Facebook.

Facebook games can be enhanced if the players are Friends; people who play lots of interactive games usually have a large number of Friends.&nbsp; Many members are not known to the general public but have a local reputation in their particular area of interest&nbsp; (eg as an events organiser, author, sportsperson, proprietor, musician, collector, academic etc) and they are happy to be friends with people who know of them, but whom they haven&#039;t met. Some Facebook members consistently post useful or entertaining information and receive many Friend Requests. Although it is not encouraged, personal Facebook pages are sometimes used for non-personal puposes (eg commercial, political, charitable etc) and Friend Requests are actively encouraged. And I am sure it occasionally happens that people play a game with their real life friends, where they each start a new account and then try to be the first to get to 1000 Friends.<br /><br />But whatever the reason, I doubt that a fool would be able to get 1000 Facebook Friends.

				Really you don&#039;t know any fools that have 1000&#039;s &quot;friends&quot;, I know lots. That adds to the confusion for me.<br /><br />If they were so unimportant in your life that you couldn&#039;t even remember their names, I don&#039;t understand why someone would give a shit if they ever see them again let alone know when they played Candy land last time or what they ate for supper?
