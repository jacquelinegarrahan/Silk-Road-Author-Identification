				Both times I&#039;ve sent $ to CampBX via money order it&#039;s always shown available to me the day after they receive it and in fact, that policy is written right on their website; &quot;Our treasurer processes all money orders next business day of receiving them.&quot; And I&#039;ve always sung their praises because they&#039;ve honored that statement up till now, and once your money does go through you get BTC $8-10 less than pretty much anywhere else. Well this time they&#039;ve done it to me. Thanks to their non responsive asses I&#039;m gonna be running the streets trying not to get burnt by jump boys so I won&#039;t be sick this weekend. Thanks slackers! Sorry had to vent. Happy fucking birthday.

				I&#039;m pretty sure their policy is next BUSINESS day so the weekends dont count and I think it says if it arrives by 1pm. Also did you get tracking? How can you be sure it arrived the other day? The mail is delayed sometimes. <br /><br />

				I always mail priority tracking and I always mail on Wednesday, it always arrives Friday, and is always there Saturday morning. In the past, Saturday has been treated as a business day. And it&#039;s not just me, I was looking at their facebook page and there are people waiting 5 days after it was shown delivered.&nbsp; They&#039;re getting too big for their own shoes from the looks of it. I know they need to keep overhead down, but with BTC popularity growing, and them being amongst the more reputable BTC platforms, they need to look into hiring some more help to keep things running smoothly. But that&#039;s just me bitching. I have all faith that it&#039;ll go through and I&#039;ll get my BTC. The truth is that I may be going to the county farm on the 19th (for traffic shit) and I just really make a few purchases before that day comes and I&#039;m running out of time.

				Oh. I&#039;ve always used first class and my deposit always showed 5 days later. Since fist class doesn&#039;t have tracking, I have no idea how long it takes to get there though.
