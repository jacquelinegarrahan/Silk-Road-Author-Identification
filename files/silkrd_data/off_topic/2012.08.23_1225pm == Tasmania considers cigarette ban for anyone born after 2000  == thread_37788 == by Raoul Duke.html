				CLEARWEB: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/9492504/Tasmania-considers-cigarette-ban-for-anyone-born-after-2000.html<br /><br />you might have some nice weather over there, but it&#039;s looking like you&#039;re being ruled by a bigger bunch of cunts than the English government. and that takes some beating<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Australian state of Tasmania is considering a ban on cigarette sales to anyone born after the year 2000 in an attempt to create a smoking-free generation. <br /><br /><br />A week after Australia upheld its world-first laws plain packaging laws, Tasmania&#039;s upper house unanimously passed a motion to introduce the ban from 2018.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The measure was proposed by Ivan Dean, a Tasmanian independent MP, who said the ban would be easy to enforce because the state already has restrictions on sales of cigarettes to minors. It would be the world&#039;s first such age-based ban and is also reportedly being considered in Singapore and Finland.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Mr Dean, a former police officer and mayor, said the ban would prevent young people &quot;from buying a product that they can&#039;t already buy&quot; but would not affect adult smokers.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;This would mean that we would have a generation of people not exposed to tobacco products,&quot; he said.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;It would be easier for retailers to enforce because when they ask for ID, all they would need to see if the person was born after the year 2000 ... As the generation reaches 18 years, there will be fewer of them smoking and while some of those first turning 18 might smoke, as time goes on fewer and fewer will.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />The state government, which will now consider whether to back the proposal in the lower house, indicated support for the ban.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Saying that those people who sell cigarettes legally cannot sell cigarettes to a certain age is appropriate,&quot; said Michelle O&#039;Byrne, the state&#039;s health minister. &quot;We do it now. What the smoke-free generation would say is that, potentially, anyone from the year 2000 would not be able to buy cigarettes ever, because every year, it would just get that little bit older.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />The measures follows a decision by the High Court last week to uphold the country&#039;s new plain packaging laws after an appeal by some of the world&#039;s biggest tobacco companies, including Japan Tobacco International, Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco. From December 1, cigarettes in Australia will be sold in drab olive packs with brand logos replaced by large graphic health warnings.<br />&nbsp;<br />The federal Attorney General, Nicola Roxon, said after the court win last week she does not plan to ban cigarettes, but noted that if tobacco were a new product it would probably not be allowed.<br />&nbsp;<br />The island state of Tasmania has the country&#039;s highest rates of smoking, with one in four young people smoking compared with one in five nationally.<br />&nbsp;<br />While the proposal was today backed by health advocates and antismoking campaigners, retailers warned it will turn the island into a &quot;nanny state&quot;.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;There needs to be awareness and education programs rather than throwing the book at today&#039;s youth, said Russell Zimmerman, from the Australian Retailers Association. &quot;It puts back virtually you into to a nanny state rather than allowing consumers to make their own, informed decisions.&quot; As the clamour has grown for an outright nationwide ban on cigarette sales, critics have argued that such a step could lead to bans on other products such as alcohol or fatty foods.<br />&nbsp;<br />However, Professor Simon Chapman, an antismoking advocate from the University of Sydney, said a ban on cigarettes would not lead to a &quot;slippery slope&quot;, mainly because tobacco was far more deadly than other products.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;If the slope is slippery, it&#039;s the most unslippery slippery dip I have ever seen in my life,&quot; he said.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;The risks of smoking are just so off the table ... We started banning tobacco advertising in 1976 and there has been no other commodity where there has been anything like a serious move to do what we have done with tobacco.&quot; The opposition in Tasmania, the site of some of Britain&#039;s harshest penal colonies, said the proposed ban was excessive.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;What&#039;s next, 50 lashes for people who break the rules?&quot; said Jeremy Rockliff, a Liberal party spokesman.<br />&nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Pfft. If you like ice maybe... :P<br /><br />Seriously though, even if this does get up it will do nothing to smoking rates. It&#039;s more a political move than anything else, as it makes them look like they&#039;re doing something, and it&#039;s hard to argue against (as any sane argument about personal freedoms is shot down with, &quot;OMG YOU SUPPORT SMOKING?! YOU&#039;RE A MONSTER!!!&quot;)<br /><br />Edit: Ice as in actual ice, not meth... :P

				This will never get through. For starters, who would police it? As if police officers would spend their time booking people born after the year 2000 who are trying to buy cigarettes! Pleassssssse.

You have to check for ID before you can sell, and if you don&#039;t you (your business) get fined. Financial incentive like that is a much bigger motivator for businesses than it is individuals (especially as the fines for a business are normally a lot larger...)

Whooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!<br /><br />International ciggie smuggling to Taz, GO TAZ!<br /><br />Why the excitement? Well, it&#039;s not just that we &lt;3 moral faggotry at SR, no sir.<br /><br />We&#039;ll be buying packs at 12 cents on the dollar from Russia and retailing them at least $35.00 for sure. I mean they retail at roughly $20 now (USD I&#039;m using, but it&#039;s almost that in Taz now)! Prohibition will surely drive the price to $35.00 or double at the very least, even with wide availability elsewhere, I mean it&#039;s not as if the shops/bars will all refuse to cooperate since they have licenses to lose.<br /><br />My point being:<br /><br />That&#039;s a mark-up of nearly 30,000%.<br /><br />For anybody who doesn&#039;t know, that&#039;s twice as good as the mark-up on heroin, which is usually the most expensive drug (apart from LSD, but that&#039;s in a category of its own)with the highest mark-up all the way from Afghan farms to the street.<br /><br />I bet &#039;only&#039; (SR vendor Cigs.eu) is doing cartwheels in the streets right now.<br /><br />30,000%! <br /><br />Empires are built on 30,000% my friends. <br />

				does anybody remember the thread when we had the threshold of traffic able amounts of drugs per state in AUS and every state had amounts you could reasonably see as being for personal use, and then TAS just had 28g of ANY drug before it was even questionable for personal use or trafficking.<br />They may try and ban cigs but who cares when you can order an ounce of pure smack and if you get caught the most you will receive is a drug diversion program to be taken with half your cousins your rooting anyway. What a Utopia.

				To be fair smoking is inherently more dangerous is Tasmania as the majority of the population have the ability to inhale twice as much with the same lung capacity as an average human so probably a smart all round decision by the &quot;heads&quot; of the familiy down there
