				It depends, I suppose. Is he asking everyone to FE? Check his recent feedback to see if people are saying &quot;FE early, will update&quot; or something like that. OR, does his profile say he requires new buyers to FE, and you are a new buyer?<br /><br />I ordered off of Haizenberg for the first time a couple weeks ago and he asked me to FE, but was asking everyone to because of the unstable bitcoin. I was hesitant at first, but saw that other people were so I did anyway and my order came through just fine.

				I require FE for everyone and I consider myself trustworthy.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; If someone has a lot of feedback, a lot of time on the site, and a very high rating you are probably going to be fine.&nbsp; Just understand that the risk is in direct proportion to how honest the vendor is.

				If the amount is something you can walk over to your toilet, flush it, and feel no remorse, than yes. If it will hurt, even a little, than look for another vendor that will escrow. Use escrow sales to build your stats up so that you won&#039;t need to FE if you can help it. Good luck! ;)

				NO! Never FE even if its just for the principle of it. Vendors wouldn&#039;t ask for it so often if people didn&#039;t do it so often. DTA- Don&#039;t Trust Anybody. It doesn&#039;t matter how good their feedback is or how honest they seem. Didn&#039;t you hear what just happened with MrAnonymousX (or something like that)? He pulled a Tony on a smaller scale. Everybody said he had bomb gear and was a cool guy. I wouldn&#039;t FE if I bought from DPR (not that he&#039;s not one of the best people in the world).

I have FE&#039;d and have had great success, and I&#039;ve FE&#039;d and got the bone. The important thing is that you treat every FE transaction as a case by case experience. Just because one vendor or one order went well, doesn&#039;t mean the next one will. <br /><br />Happy trips!

				The only time I FE&#039;d, was my first order with Nevita. It worked out just fine, but now that i have thousands spent on here since then I probably won&#039;t ever do it again since all the horror stories I read on the forums.

				Seems like people are really split on whether to FE or not. I have since FE&#039;d for this particular vendor, it&#039;s not something i want to make a habit of, too risky i feel, but for this transaction i did--he requested it,he has 100% feedback, communication is good,reviews i&#039;ve read about him are good, i do get a &#039;good&#039; feeling about this vendor( i don&#039;t know why i just do)--so yeah i did--just hope it turns up now--if it doesn&#039;t it will be a lesson learnt and i will never FE again--i will just switch vendor.

				As someone who fell into the FE trap of the much discussed Mr Anonymous recently (and lost over 8 BTC) I will join the chorus of NEVER FE.<br /><br />I am still hurting from it and its a bitter lesson.

				ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! SR will not help you at all if you FE. Once you hit that button your money is gone for good. I was recently ripped off by a vendor with 100% positive feedback over 300+ transactions. Dont do it!!! I know its tempting when you want your goods but bitcoins are expensive and in some places hard to get. Any vendor can rip you off even the ones that seem like they are being helpful. The guy that ripped me off said he was helping me cuz Im disabled and I never heard from him again. Its also against the rules to FE and everytime someone falls for it, the buyers get away with asking them to do it. In my opinion vendors should be reported when asking to FE.

Finalize AFTER you receive the gear and confirm it&#039;s what you ordered.<br /><br />NEVER FE.

				I&#039;m not smart at all! Worked construction all my life because I couldn&#039;t get past any school.<br /><br />So how come back in October 2011 when I first discovered this place I understood immediately that your only protection against drug dealing idiots - I&#039;m not talking to the honest ones - and there ARE MANY honest vendors out there! - is Escrow. You buy from an unreliable, un-moral vendor some where and you&#039;re going to send your hard earned cash to someone who will keep it and laugh at you as they walk away richer with your coin and what are you going to do if they don&#039;t refund or even send you anything? Call the cops! <br /><br />I guess if you want to hear THEM laugh at you too and get zero help - .... you could. So in all my time here on The Rode I have never finalized before my package comes. I finalize that same hour it arrives because that is the correct thing to do! I rarely visit the forums because the dyslexic don&#039;t Grok anything more technical than Mother Goose. Y&#039;all are a lot smarter than me. <br /><br />Yet you&#039;re here making up a post asking about giving up your right - Escrow - and the only reason to shop here! Not getting down on you! I&#039;m the dummy, remember? But why have I never FE&#039;d? What does management here tell you EVERY WHERE about finalizing before your item has arrived? Not now! NOT EVER! Do you FE! <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to do that just send your coins to me and at least one of us might get something! If your &#039;stats&#039; are perfect and you have no - AND I DO MEAN &#039;NO&#039;! - auto-finalize % - then no one should ask you to FE. I don&#039;t care if you just joined. You might be asked to buy less of what you wanted. THAT is reasonable. So if that lobotomy you had last week from the dieing hooker junkie around the block fails for some reason and you&#039;re just going to fuck this vendor then he&#039;s not out much if you brains slip on out to the curb side and you fuck everyone for everything you can just because you&#039;re defective. But for no reason? <br /><br />I DON&#039;T THINK SO! DO I HAVE A DICK ON MY FOREHEAD?<br /><br />I work with a couple of vendors here to some capacity and no vendor of any reputable character themselves will ask you to give up the only reason to buy here. If any vendors who do ask a buyer to FE read this - well, I am truly sorry to offend. A buyer feels good about your feedback and reviews and FE&#039;s. Then you die on your way to ship it. Stranger shit has happened people. That 18 wheeler cold cocks you from the side and flattens your Fiat - probably didn&#039;t even scratch his truck but you ded! You want that bad Karma to follow you into your next &#039;gig&#039;? You didn&#039;t mean to fuck this buyer but you did. I would rather you just tell us that you ask - to shop else where. <br /><br />You buyers out there that don&#039;t make it you main priority in life to finalize when your item does arrive .... you have no integrity. I have some friends here that lobbied hard for a year, writing both SR management and any vendor that I noticed was requiring FE for this and that - bull shit! Eventually they got tired of the books I write that never seem to go anywhere - and they stopped asking for FE. The Escrow is in place to protect Vendor and buyer alike. When they realize that they only had to deal with the occasional buyer who thinks its okay to get to paying for your package when you get to it. <br /><br />If that is how you feel, please don&#039;t buy from SR! It is not just rude to let something &#039;auto-finalize&#039;, a vendor is unable to replenish their wares and with this dumb ass bitcoin having a mind of it&#039;s own - they can actually loose money on what they sent you .... 18 days later! <br /><br />So! At least you don&#039;t have to worry about my meandering around in this post just pushing my keys with not thought what so ever!<br /><br />1. Never, EVER! FE! 2. When you get you item - get your ass either to your computer or if you&#039;re like me and live in windy area&#039;s that seems to like to knock out the juice - I keep everything tor/SR/Gpg on a 5 buck USP flash drive and get my old dumb ass down to the library where they all have internet access. It won&#039;t take you the 15 minutes those 15 minute computers they keep a limit on for people not wanting to chat with women or men - lieing to them about how buff, young and well endowed you aren&#039;t. You don&#039;t even have to show ID for those 15 minute ones for the truly paranoid. The ole In n Out Burger! Make paying the vendor like he/she made sending your item to you - a priority. <br /><br />Last note! My puter&#039;s running out of ink and digital paper to type on! ... what was I saying? ??? shit! ... uhhh? <br /><br />Oh! Go to ANY vendor and read 10 pages or so of feedback at their info/home page. You&#039;ll see time and again in the feedback, &quot;FE for trusted vendor&quot;! How the fuck do you know that vendor is &quot;trusted&quot;? Shit can and does happen to anyone - even the most careful and honest people in world. Trust me - you&#039;re not complimenting them! Your grabbing your ankles and praying he doesn&#039;t have A.I.D.S when he fucks you in your behind! That&#039;s why the big bows set sales up with escrow.<br /><br />Don&#039;t do that shit people! Do things the way the genius monger&#039;s that thought this fucking thing for us all! Be a part of something pretty cool - a Woodstock, a hippy movement - the 60&#039;s when LSD was still pure and legal! There will never be something like Silk Road again in history! I&#039;m proud to have discovered The Road! Thats almost as good as when my band warmed up The Doors! Be a part of something really pronominal and do it THERE WAY!<br /><br />Aren&#039;t you glad I came in here tonight .... morning? ... to see if anyone else thinks Instawallet isn&#039;t just making the biggest most easy heist of the century! Those mother fuckers are damned lucky they&#039;re over in Japan or I&#039;d walk all up and down their lieing asses. I lost hundreds of dollars using their fucking wallets. First they said they were going to be paying any wallets back 90 days after you file a claim. Then on the 90th day they posted an notice that they will be taking another 90 days to pay you your coins. And if your wallet has more than 50 bitcoins - your get NOTHING! <br /><br />Garth! Remember your pills! Heather Locklier, Heather Locklier.......&nbsp; Say good night Fred
