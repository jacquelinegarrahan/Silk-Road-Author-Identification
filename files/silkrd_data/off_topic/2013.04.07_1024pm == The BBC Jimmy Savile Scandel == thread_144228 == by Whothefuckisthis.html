				So I&#039;m sure as many of you have heard about or even seen reports of the claims that Jimmy Savile the old BBC boss of Top of Pop&#039;s is accused of commiting sexual acts with underage girls. Now I&#039;m sure some of you who have followed the case have heard names of others implicated in operation yewtree including, Gary Glitter, Freddie Star, and Max Clifford. For the past week the name of an 82 year old Austrailian big name celebrity had also been arrested for accusations against him while working in the 80&#039;s at the BBC. Rumors have been flying around that the celeb (who all major articles refuse to name) is none other the the child entertainer Rolf Harris! <br />I&#039;ve looked into this as much as possible but as I would expect most people at baffled and in denial about this. But if anyone has more knowledge about this or even shed some light from either counties perspective would be really great.<br /><br />And for those of you who have to ask, just look up BBC Jimmy Savile, and Rolf Harris Jimmy Savile.

The reason why I brought it up because the fact that this was coverd up until Saviles death. And that this pedophile scandal is even rumored that some aspects of the case are being covered up to protect the image of The BBC and even the Royal Family.<br />Even though it may be irrelevant to you but some of us are shocked about wether or not it is Rolf Harris cause it&#039;d be the equivalent of finding out Mr. Rogers molested children.

				the rolf harris rumours are new?!!!!! could swear i heard his name in relation to all that last year! fuck that shit. look up ian watkins the singer from lostprophets. that shit&#039;s even more fucked up. conspiracy to rape a 1 year old baby, possession and distribution of child porn, bestiality, and allegedly he was trying to spread HIV to as many people as he could. he&#039;s on remand until trial. apparently he spends every night crying in his cell in isolation. the statement the rest of the band issued showed no support towards him. took him a couple months to release a statement saying he &#039;vigorously denies the allegations made against him&#039; yeah. he&#039;s even up on motherless.com and had a couples escort profile too but that got taken down after he was arrested. i found my signed poster when i was high the other day and freaked the fuck out. anyway it&#039;s about time the police started taking this kind of shit seriously and acting on it. <br />the bbc cover up is definitely not news and saville&#039;s links with prince charles are no secret.

But wow I had now idea about Lost Prophet&#039;s shit! That&#039;s fucking crazy! Yeah I read that they launched a royal investigation or something like that and my mind thought of their connection with Rolf. But it&#039;s amazing on how many news sources are refusing to name names and some are not even acknowledging the stories.<br /><br />Sorry about the poster man. On the bright side it could one day be valuable serial killer memorabilia.

Although he&#039;s not as big as say Mr Rogers in my world, but still it was pretty nuts to hear that. But it&#039;s like some say, brings a new meaning to the song Two Little Boys.
