				the dudes fucked, doubtful any assault charges will be given; also seeing as she left of her own free will ,even if she is 15 there should be no kidnapping charges either.<br /><br />he&#039;l never work again in the UK as a teacher though, totally fucks with the &#039;duty of care&#039; thing that people and officials in such positions have.<br /><br />worth it for some 15 year old hairless poon?<br /><br />naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

				The girl looks like a little pig too lol. <br /><br />And nah the guy will have the book thrown at him I reckon. If he&#039;s had sex with her she&#039;s 15 so that&#039;s good ol&#039; statutory rape. <br /><br />And neither should he work in the U.K again, fucking creep that he is. <br /><br />Go and have a look at his Myspace and listen to the songs.....fucking freak. <br /><br />Torch or pitchfork anyone? Or buy both in the &quot;Nonce Lynching&quot; package for a discount? Get them while you can!

Absolutely disgusting and something that I totally give a fuck about and in fact am outraged about. Not that long ago people married 12 year olds for fucks sake.

				Seriously you must have to lie to yourself pretty convincingly to think that you are actually not attracted to 15 year olds. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_scale<br /><br />Tanner V <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla.

				Ignore Lim, kmfkewm I&#039;m pretty sure he deliberately posted this just to get a reaction out of you.<br /><br />As for Lim, he needs to lay off the smack *cough*, I mean tabloids (same thing), I&#039;ve told him before it&#039;s a dreadful malady, an addiction and an affliction. Seriously, these papers are written by the most histrionic people on the planet, it can only be described as the outpourings of a warped mind, and I&#039;m not referring to the content of their articles, but the idea that somebody somewhere must give a fuck about some trivial garbage like this.<br /><br />You should put down the microscope Mr L, and pick up the telescope on the human condition, it&#039;ll do you a world of good. Or you could murder everybody inside the Big Brother house, that would work for me too, but only if you could put tripmines in all the newspaper offices of people trying to publish a story about how terrible it was that somebody knocked them all off. I... just can&#039;t cope with that kind of dishonesty.<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it, if you read tabloids then sooner or later you start to believe in eugenics. This is not a healthy state of mind.

Do you realize that she is legal in a shit ton of first world countries through out Europe? A couple of years ago she was over a year older than the age of consent in Canada. Wanting to cut someones dick off for fucking her is insanity. I question your mental stability more than that of the man she ran off with. You have been brainwashed by the government. Your attraction to girls who are a certain arbitrarily selected age is almost entirely a socially programmed illusion, biologically you are wired to be attracted to post-pubescent potential mates. You barely need to go back in history at all before it was common and socially acceptable to take wives younger than this girl. Your opinions are entirely a construct of the social environment you have been raised in, they contradict your very biology and indeed are at odds with almost all of history and much of the worlds present beliefs. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Am I the only one who prefers women to girls here? Kmf I gotta say bud it&#039;s pretty weird you post in every single thread about stuff like this. Sure you can argue women *can* be fully physically developed by 15, but why?

FIGHT!! :D</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is highly doubtful that you can even differentiate between 15 year olds and 18 year olds based on physical appearance so if you are physically attracted to women you are physically attracted to 15 year olds. It is simply a fact of life, the average age that full sexual maturity is reached is approximately 14.5 years. I think it is off putting that he is her teacher as well. I don&#039;t judge people who are 36 with 18 year old girlfriends and 15 and 30 is not a big deal either. What is so off putting about it? He didn&#039;t force her to do anything did he? What sort of a naive world have you grown up in where you perceive 15 year olds as being little children still? <br /><br /><br />

Also ephebophilia is largely bullshit as it is attraction to people ages ~15-17 which can not be differentiated from 17+ in many cases (which is what teliophile is, preference for 17+ not 18+ for what it is worth). If you define it as a preference for 15-17 then I would not actually consider myself an ephebophile as I am also attracted to people who are 17+ and do not have an exclusive preference for 17 and under.

				Interestingly the school has a history of safeguard failings, my opinion is that if she is old enough in two months then wait, would have been a lot less hassle for them both, but if i was her dad I&#039;d dust off the shotgun.<br /><br />Sheeple net alert:<br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19717837

				That&#039;s what I find so ridiculously funny about the whole thing, if he&#039;d have waited till she&#039;d finished school they could have done what the fuck they wanted with impunity but now he&#039;s fucked his life and, completely selfishly IMO, fucked hers too especially if this means she screws her education. I mean, you&#039;d think if he &quot;loved&quot; her like he claims he&#039;d maybe want her to have a future by having her education sorted? I dunno maybe not, but that&#039;s just me.

I&#039;m just attempting to be ethically consistent with my value system, which is that if your actions can be truly said to be voluntary, without any coercion, then they are not morally wrong. You may not like them, it may be very far from your preferences, but they are not morally wrong in any realistic sense. Or as one famous judge once said;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;The right to swing my fist ends where the other man&#039;s nose begins.&quot; -- Oliver Wendell Holmes <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is an ancient and sound principal in Western liberal (not in the political sense of the word) ethical values and judicial heuristics, albeit both of those appear to have been on the slide for some considerable time now, mores the pity.<br /><br />Once you reach a certain age, your actions stop being your parents responsibility and become your own responsibility and that is that for better or for worse. My grandparents were working their butts off when they left school, which for them was about 12 (not implying 12 year olds should get married (!), just that a previous generation was intellectually (for whatever reasons) far more responsible and independent than your average &#039;tween&#039; these days.) I think 12, 13 or 14 is too early to be married or have any kind of relationship involving intercourse, but at 15, although it&#039;s certainly the bleeding edge of what is responsible, is roughly the right cut off point. If you want a dividing line, that&#039;s mine. For other people it&#039;s 16, which is actually the vast majority of places in the world, even in the West if you take the time to look it up.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not actually that very many people actually have relationships or sex (despite what the tabloids would have you believe, teens are not having any more sex than they used to, it&#039;s a rarity, there is just no evidence for this bizarre concept, it doesn&#039;t get called out as factually incorrect as much as it should be) at that age, it&#039;s actually very rare, so this is all a big hubbabubba about nothing. I mean some people shouldn&#039;t have relationships at any age to be honest, there are so many &quot;man-childs&quot; and whatever the lady (/bitch) version is supposed to be nowadays. They have the right, but not the ability to be self sacrificing and offer genuine commitment, which is a terrible curse for all parities involved. I stay a league away from such people if I can help it, they&#039;re just trouble and endless man/women-child grief. Often, even if they are not being subsidized by the State, they are getting handouts from their parents well into their 30s and 40s, it disgusts me. <br /><br />I mean things just got a whole lot tougher for young people nowadays since our new depression, but the majority of people with these &#039;subsides&#039; are well older than that generation, and benefited from the biggest bull market in the economy for centuries.

				I sped read the past five pages of this thread, so forgive me if I have missed what I&#039;m about to say being mentioned. Last night on the 10 o clock news, the reporter said that France are refusing to cover this, they are simply not interested. If the French public/police/passport control etc. are unaware of this situation, how are they meant to be found? Interpol can only go so far... Besides they could be anywhere now. I don&#039;t understand why France took this stance? It&#039;s plain wrong.
