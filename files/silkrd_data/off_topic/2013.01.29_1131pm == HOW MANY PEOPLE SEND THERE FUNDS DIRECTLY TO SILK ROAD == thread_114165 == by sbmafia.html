				I used to send them directly from bitmarket.eu but quickly realized how stupid that is as I learned more about how Bitcoin works. Now I send them to Bitcoin Fog and then to SR.

				Silk Road automatically tumbles your coins for you. So i go straight from supplier to SR account.<br /><br />If i feel extra paranoid, i might go from supplier &gt; my offline wallet &gt; SR.

				After doin a bit of research when I first signed up, I&#039;m still ok with goin from Bitinstant to my SR account.&nbsp; All my steps up to that point are completely anonymous/aliased so there&#039;s not much in the BC exchange from Bitinstant &gt; SR thats going to risk exposure IMO, esp with the tumbler process...

				Well, quite frankly I don&#039;t trust the SR tumbler. If we don&#039;t trust SR with our unencrypted addresses I don&#039;t see why the fuck we should trust it with untumbled coins.

				from the market I bought it - <br />first to an ofline wallet - <br />then to an online wallet (one that gives the option for &quot;anonymous transactions&quot;) - <br />then to SR<br /><br />I change my wallet address (at least on int the system of 3) every time. <br /><br />how could I improve this?

				I use a different wallet each time.<br />topup with bank details.<br />send the btc to a new wallet ive made.<br />then resend to a new SR link each time.<br />I don&#039;t really need to make a new wallet but it only costs like 0.01btc<br /><br />I have a few wallets with 0.002 btc or thereabouts sitting around. Is it not possible to combine all these or do i need to send a certain amount to them to cover the transaction fee?<br /><br />offline wallet to online wallet is a good idea,<br />is there anything wrong with this method?&nbsp; or my method?<br /><br />thanks

				Do any of you Hero members have any tried &amp; trusted apps/websites you&#039;d recommend for a personal client wallet?&nbsp; Sounds like the safe way to go instead of straight to SR..

				I have my coins sent directly to my SR account.<br /><br />At the start i used a 3rd wallet, etc, but most times it just took too long, sometimes 3-5 days which wasnt good enough.<br /><br />So i messaged SR about it. <br /><br />If your just buying every now and then, like i do, then just have your coins sent directly to SR, and change your deposit address once a month.<br /><br />SR have their own built in tumblers, etc. After i did this, i have my coins within 2-3hrs tops. I&#039;ve had them go in once in under 2hrs.<br /><br />So theres no problem if your just making 1-2 purchases a month. ;)

				Usually I send my cash (through BitInstant) straight to my infochain wallet, then from there anonymously to SR. A couple of times when BitInstant would not send to a bitcoin address I sent funds to BTC-E, bought bitcoins, and sent them to my wallet. Then to SR, of course.
