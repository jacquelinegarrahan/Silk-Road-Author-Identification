				I was thinking about setting up a trap in an old unused closet in my basement. I live alone so no one would have a reason to go in their. Im pridy good with mechanics and what not and I was thinking for setting up the door handle so if you turned it the opposite way it would open normally but if you turned it the wrong way you would receive a shotgun shell to the chest. Would I get in legal trouble since I dint actually kill the LE agent and it was them that got themselves killed well searching my house. I already have my grow room set up so if people enter by force a motion censor picks them up and the gas ignited the only way to turn it of is from outside the room with a password I would never give to LE, could that get me in any real trouble with the law? If the saw the plants but could not collect them because they burn would they be able to use that as evidence?

				What the fuck?&nbsp; Seriously?<br /><br />YES, you would be charged with premeditated murder and probably end up executed in most states.&nbsp; That&#039;s like asking if you could legally get away with poisoning someone&#039;s food as long as you didn&#039;t operate the spoon.<br /><br />In response to #2, yeah... they can still bust you.&nbsp; First of all you aren&#039;t going to be able to incinerate all the evidence... and the simple fact that you rigged something up to burn evidence would be considered evidence, and it would be an additional felony that has a much tougher penalty than growing weed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to mention the potential charges for arson, attempted murder and a whole host of other things.

				Who the fuck raised you dude? This is seriously idiotic, like did you go to school at ACME or something? Do you honestly believe that setting up a trap designated to shoot a law enforcement officer is legal, much less moral? How stupid, of course you&#039;d be blamed! You can be sentenced to death or life imprisonment for committing first degree murder, which this would qualify I&#039;m sure. Rigging your plants up to incinerate themselves is also destruction of evidence which, as aloutte mentioned, is way worse a crime than growing the plants in the first place. I highly recommend you start buying some nootropics asap, because you could stand to have a lot more common sense as clearly you&#039;re already lacking.

				What if I was to claim SWIM set up the traps that protects on the internet from getting in trouble, cant I just say it was my pet monkey that ran away. I see tones of people use this type of excuse on the internet when discusing making drugs and not one of them get in trouble. Surely the same rools aplie.

				I don&#039;t really agree with all your tactics but I can&#039;t say I haven&#039;t thought of the same things. I don&#039;t think you could get charged that hard if you owned the home.

It doesn&#039;t apply to real life. Claiming someone else must have built the lethal trap in your closet in the home you live alone in is like saying you&#039;re not a virgin because Santa Clause flies down your chimney every Christmas and sucks your dick. Clearly it&#039;s not true just because you say so, LEO&#039;s are evil but not stupid. ???

				Honestly I think swim is quite secure. I would say more secure than thor. I have seen lots of chemists escape jail because their post said swim so le dont bother going after them. Theirs just no case to be made. Lots of sr sellers get busted all the time for example tony76 how many times did you see him use swim?

It won&#039;t matter what fucking alias&#039;s you use online when you&#039;re facing first degree murder in your own home. To think anything different is just stupid. ???

Literally no evidence at all one user on this site was tracking his moving BTC which is way more evidence to prove he is alive and free. <br /><br />SWIM more sexcure than an anonymous way to browse the internet? are you kidding do you now how tor works? I could say any name on here right now to replace swim and my source is untraceable.

				^^^^^What they said. 1. don&#039;t be an idiot, this is an incredibly stupid idea. 2. there is enough LE scrutiny on this forum without posting this kind of shit. This makes us all look like a bunch of thugs.

				OP you are a bit of a fuck-stick. Really doesn&#039;t do SR many favours when LE watch this place to discuss how to kill their staff because I think it MAY attract a bit more undesired attention. Could be wrong here but who knows. We could just invite Taliban on here as well so they can discuss the best ways to create IEDs while they eat their Sunday dinner, or maybe the IRA too and fuck it we&#039;ll add the Tamil Tigers into the mix just to get a nice cross section of terrorists from around the globe..<br /><br />FML....<br /><br />Locked.
