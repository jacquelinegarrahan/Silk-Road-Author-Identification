				Totally agree with you two!&nbsp; Without naming names there&#039;s really not a decent seller of hydro on the entire site.&nbsp; That&#039;s a gap in the product selection at this point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hydro street prices have basically doubled in the last 5 years.&nbsp; 2006 it was $2.50-$3.00 for a Watson or Norco 10/325.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s $5 to $6.<br /><br />Ditto for the first quality generic Xanax.&nbsp; Gador 2mg bars used to be $2.00-$2.50 for a LONG time.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s $4-$5.<br /><br />But you still get a lot of bang for the buck as compared to oxy or dilaudid.&nbsp; And other benzos are very cheap, like valium.<br /><br />There&#039;s a high for every person at every price!&nbsp; How democratic.&nbsp; :)

				Well that depends.&nbsp; If it&#039;s the only one listed then it is not high,&nbsp; Whats the price of tea in china, yesterday? Who cares.<br /><br />Compared to street,yeah it&#039;s high but one has nothing to do with the other.<br /><br />The guy probably already sells them on the street and for him to even consider selling online he needs to charge more to make it worth it for him.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said luckily there are a few vendors here that sell 30mg oxycodone tablets for less than that per mg.&nbsp; <br />

				What MarketMaker said.. Couldn&#039;t have said it better.. I have a certain price that I have to have, If I don&#039;t get it then I&#039;m not selling it, just not worth it.

				Risk vs. reward seems to be a more accurate indicator of price on the Silk Road than supply and demand.

				I&#039;d say supply and demand play a part since the original post is <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">is it just me or does that seem like way too much for a 10mg norco?&nbsp; hopefully supply will knock down prices.............</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To me that means he sees no other listings for it, or there is not much supply.&nbsp; If we added more supply, all things being equal his (as in what he personally is holding) demand will be lower, since there will be other places to get it from.&nbsp; If the oher vendors sell at a lower price, again all things being equal he will more likely than not be forced to lower his prices, unless he can outlast them until they sell out, then he can again command a higher price because there will be no other supply or competition.<br /><br /><br />

				yeah, it&#039;s hilarious what people will charge on here, but it&#039;s the seller&#039;s right to charge what they want. if they&#039;re getting orders, then more power to them. if they&#039;re not, they&#039;ll have to adjust their price.<br /><br />norcos go for $4-6 a piece around here.

				I have to charge about 30 percent more here than f2f If I want to make the same amount of money. shipping costs, fees to turn btc into cash, bitcoin fluctuation. Plus, its a lot more work.

				Hey, $15 a Norco is cheap now. Today I saw a listing for $42 bucks PER 4mg dilaudid. I think I&#039;m going to sell my 2mg for $80/piece just for shits and giggles!
