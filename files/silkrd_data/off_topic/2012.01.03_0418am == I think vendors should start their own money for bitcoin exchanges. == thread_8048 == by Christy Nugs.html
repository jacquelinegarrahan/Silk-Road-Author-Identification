				I have recently been checking out a couple &quot; Vendor I want your bitcoin &quot; pages and they are so convoluted and hard to understand what the purveyors of these pages are saying, not to mention what happens when you go to their order order pages that say absolutely nothing about what is actually going on in terms that are clear and succinct . Wait a minuet, was that a run on sentence? It&#039;s like a 3 card monty&nbsp; game - u never know what u r gonna get. I consider it absolutely absurd to pump in an unknown amount of bitcoins for a highly dubious and unknown amount of dollars at best. I say an unknown amount of bitcoins because my radar was smacking me in the side of the head with a hammer so i didn&#039;t push the order button.<br /><br />I will never name names but i have serious doubts about transfers of this sort when all i have to do is drive a hour to San Francisco and trade in a grand or two in person and then go out for a wonderful lunch.....OMG!!! I guess I will be having lots of nice lunches and site seeing in the near future.<br /><br />It all is just so distasteful and shady - I won&#039;t deal. Bad karma all the way around. I just f&#039;ing hate scammers.<br />If your not scammers your: business model, communication and marketing skills blow.<br /><br />Anyone else feel the same way? Except for the obvious tie in danger and need for separated transactions once u get the: cards,packs, etc.?<br /><br />Let me know;<br />Christy<br /><br />Fuck it my customers know ima legit - ima do it.&nbsp; &lt;3 &lt;3<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have recently been checking out a couple of posts on the SR forum but somtimes they are so convoluted and hard to understand what the purveyors of these threads are saying, not to mention what happens when you logon absolutely stoned and you have to re-read everything 3-4 times to get a idea of what is actually going on. u never know what u r gonna get. I consider it absolutely absurd to post whilst pumped up or emotionally charged. I&#039;d say an unknown amount of re-examination will feel like somebody smacking me in the side of the head with a hammer so i didn&#039;t want to hit the reply button but felt I needed to.

				The logical thing is that once a vendor gets big time on SR they open another sellers account and become a bitcoin exchanger.<br /><br />For instance<br /><br />Borneo == Pharmville<br /><br />BTCBuddy = MrDdroMcgully<br /><br />Both of these bitcoin exchangers are known and trusted basiclly because they are obligated to be trust worthy out of neccesity. Both Pharmville and MrDdroMcgully want cash not BitCoins so they are honest. However if you dont have a vendor account you dont have much business being a bitcoin exchanger unless you plan to scam people.

				It seems a risky prospect to me. It&#039;s just one step shy of actually accepting MP for your dope deals. If LE catches on to it, it becomes pretty easy to either seize your money or track you down via your cash outs. IMO, vendor cash out business isn&#039;t something to be discussed publicly.

				I can&#039;t start an exchange. Its called &quot;Cross Promotion&quot; &quot;Marketing&quot; &quot;Power of suggestion&quot; I want ALL my friends and fans to come up in the community. One reputable vendor to another. We both win. I can&#039;t accept MoneyPaks from the general public. LE would love to give me a few and make a bust. No way, bro. LE would love to get anyone! Assholes!! <br />It is true that I want to cash out. That&#039;s why I do business with the best. The best buyers and vendors. I try and only associate myself with the best.&nbsp; So far its worked out fairly well for me. I could take my btc to the off site exchanges. But I found a better way. Why go backwards? <br /><br /><br />
