				It really depends on what temperature you&#039;re vaping at. Most of mine comes out light brown, although sometimes I&#039;ll still have some green left.<br /><br />I never try to revape it...just use it for edibles. :)

				Til Brown, no more vapor comes out.<br />Try turning your temperature up to 200 degrees F or 160 degrees C.<br />

				@theone - I have an extreme Q too and at first i used to go from 190 - 220 C (raising temp between bags by 5 C i.e. about 7-8 bags) but not i dont do more than 2-3 bags.<br /><br />Btw if you want to get thick hits/vapor from the Extreme Q I would advice you to use the bag, elbow pack (ask me if you dont know what that means), and start at 190 C. Do at max 3 bags at 190, 195 and 200 because above 200 the smoke gets a bit too harsh and there is not much left to vape either. I vape till there is no green left and till the weed is like a sort of coffee brown color.<br /><br />Pro-tip - If using elbow pack method make sure you clean the screen with Isopropyl alcohol before using it for the next session. I didnt clean the screen initially and wasted a lot of weed due to blockage.<br /><br />Hope this helps..

We are NOW relaxing after a day of working with strong elbow hits of finely ground resiny herb, taking hits from the whip which provides an amazing UPLIFTING high!<br /><br />We agree! Munchies are awesome after getting stoned, however the vaporiser just get&#039;s you TOO STONED and you get mega munchies, you can eat a truck load! <br /><br />555+++<br /><br />FUCK COMBUSTION!
