				I can&#039;t be the only one that spends my BTC change on porn... what else is there to buy?&nbsp; :P<br />It sucks though because I plan out my bitcoin purchases so well I only end up with 2-5 dollars change, which equates to a really crappy porn collection on my computer..<br />I know boys love wanking it to internet porn, someone must have favorites I should know about? :P<br />Edit: Browsing 446 listening with no categories is time consuming.. haha

I don&#039;t know about you but I think that&#039;s really cool. I believe everyone should have these freedoms. Don&#039;t you? We were all created equal after all. <br /><br />Communists countries sure don&#039;t have these freedoms. Consider donating to a charity such as halfthesky.org to help Chinese children and families, even some churches have taken action. China&#039;s factory conditions and toxic waste removal are inhuman from what I&#039;ve read. Otherwise I&#039;m sure your local food shelf wouldn&#039;t mind the consideration.<br /><br />I&#039;ll match you up to 50 USD this one time :) my vote is redcross or halfthesky.org<br /><br />I thank you for them in advance!

				lolololol. Yeah, I&#039;m such a girl when it comes to shopping here. I tend to put a lil extra money in when I deposit so I&#039;ll have some leftover to buy porn or e-books or software. :)<br /><br />Of course you can find porn on the internet for free, but for a measly .10 BTC I can get access to an asston of porn sites with high quality full length videos :) It&#039;s really nice to have long videos like that to play in the background sometimes when you&#039;re with someone.

				Haha, you totally read my mind, I do the exact same thing. I bought a ton of porn &amp; TV from warweed when the price of bitcoins took a dump after the Pirate scam too. I know everything is available for free if you know where to look, but I&#039;m willing to pay for the convenience and customer service.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=79766.msg612873#msg612873">Quote from: shitwassocash on November 21, 2012, 05:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">lolololol.
