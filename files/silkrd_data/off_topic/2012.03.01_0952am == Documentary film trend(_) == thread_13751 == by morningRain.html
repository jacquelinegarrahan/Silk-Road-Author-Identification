				IMHO The Corporation and the Zeitgeist movies are as mad as a box of hot frogs. The makers of those so called documentaries know literally next to nothing about the history of capitalism. They gloss over highly complex topics and pretend that long appreciated market principals are some manner of conspiracy theory.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go on, but specifically, from watching The Corporation you&#039;d imagine a panglossian world of peace, harmony and stability before corporations came into existence.

By golly those sneaky capitalists got through again! By Jove!&quot;. I mean, are you serious?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong. Capitalism is not a perfect system, I don&#039;t have rose tinted glasses, but their statements about it are ludicrously ignorant.<br /><br />If you want the big picture, you&#039;re going to have to read some books, because there *are* literally no good documentaries on Capitalism, I&#039;ve scoured the internet and came up with zero.<br /><br />&nbsp;- The Birth of Plenty by William Bernstein<br /><br />&nbsp;- The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner<br /><br />&nbsp;- Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles MacKay<br /><br />&nbsp;- The Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson<br /><br />That selection is deliberately chosen to be non-biased as possible, if anything it&#039;s biased in the other direction, since only 1 of those authors is actually pro-capitalist (N.F). The others lean(ed) to the Left of the political spectrum. <br /><br />Also they are fantastically well written books besides being as accurate as it&#039;s reasonable to expect from any one individual.<br /><br />People like Naomi Klein and Chomsky are the worst source of information about the System, they are entirely caught up in a paradigm which is completely politically USA-centric and centered around the perceived &#039;issues of the day&#039;. If you check out the references Chomsky uses, you&#039;ll quickly find that although he sounds smart, he is ridiculously blinkered, some of the most gregarious examples of intellectual cherry picking I&#039;ve ever seen. He is not an economist, nor an historian, he&#039;s a linguist. Smarts from one field of science don&#039;t translate to the next. <br /><br />If you want some insightful critiques of capitalism, then you should watch Adam Curtis&#039;s documentaries (two of which are mentioned in the OP&#039;s post, namely the Century of the Self and the Power of Nightmares). I don&#039;t entirely agree with him either, but at least he&#039;s making a valiant attempt to figure out the System.<br /><br />Protip: if you want a good &amp; proper mind-fuck, then do this:<br /><br />Watch a documentary called &quot;Collapse&quot;, then immediately afterwards watch a documentary called &quot;Transcendent Man&quot;.

				I am really glad that you mentioned The Century of Self ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhxfArTAcfM ) and Power of Nightmares, both are docs made by the brilliant Adam Curtis of the BBC.&nbsp; Check out his blog at www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/ to see some great essays with videos, some great stuff on Murdoch and the media, why occupy protesters may be so afraid of making demands andd plenty of other stuff, great archive material permeates his work.<br /><br />AC&#039;s other great series is Pandora&#039;s Box about technology and rationality leading to some pretty fucked up results.&nbsp; First one has some great interviews.<br />http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8312897319201458250<br /><br />And The Trap, The Living Dead and The Mayfair Set are all well worth watching, just googling them + Adam curtis to find them.<br /><br />John Pilger is a bit preachy for some but check out The War on Democracy @ http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3739500579629840148 if you&#039;re interested in U.S. hypocrisy and it&#039;s relations in Latin Amercia.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a doc but if you want a good read you should try and find the Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia by Alfred W. McCoy, a history professor who traveled to Vietnam, investigated the French-Indo-Chinese heroin ops that financed French Secret Service ops in Indo-China before then transferring those heroin ops onto U.S. services and the continuation of the drug trade up to and during the Vietnam War.&nbsp; &nbsp;Truly an incredible story.<br /><br />A later work of McCoy looks at the the Nicaraguan civil war and it&#039;s financing by the CIA smuggling cocaine in 80s.<br /><br />McCoy&#039;s work leads to the inevitable conclusion that the CIA is against legalization of drugs because it would loose so much money for it&#039;s many illegal and secret operations.<br /><br />

				++1 on &quot;The Century of Self&quot;<br />amazing documentary series<br /><br />Adam Curtis released another documentary series shortly after that one called &quot;The Trap — What Happened to our Dream of Freedom&quot; that is equally as mind boggling as The Century of Self
