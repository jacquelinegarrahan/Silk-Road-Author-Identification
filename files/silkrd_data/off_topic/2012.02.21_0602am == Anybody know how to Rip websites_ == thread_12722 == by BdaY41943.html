				What I&#039;m trying to do here is rip all of the music off of this 1 website, you have to pay for it obviously, which i have on over 20 occasions, but quite frankly im sick of doing that.&nbsp; I asked one of the vendors who does things like this and he said he doesnt have the time, so i was wondering if anyone else here with some technical know how could point me in the right direction so hopefully i could figure it out myself?

				Check out Screen-Scraper basic edition, or Visual Web Ripper.<br /><br />There is a learning curve, as with any application, but with a little effort one of them should fill your needs.

				Are you using Windows?<br /><br />You might try looking into WinHTTrack, which is free.<br /><br />I guess HTTrack is also available for Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD.

				The only one I know is already stated above (WinHTTrack) The only thing though is I am not sure if it would rip anything that requires a password to access. So if it&#039;s something that need&#039;s to have been purchased I think you would need some extra steps to it but at least it&#039;s a place to start.

				If the site is coded well, it will be impossible. Just torrent your music like everyone else.

				I completely agree, I get all my music in entire discographies or albums and rather quickly. I have over 6000 songs in my collection and that&#039;s that I delete quite a bit and often as well.
