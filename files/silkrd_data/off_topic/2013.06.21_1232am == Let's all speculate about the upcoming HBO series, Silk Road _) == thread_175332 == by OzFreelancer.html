				All we know at the moment is that it is going to be a &#039;thriller&#039; - http://twitchfilm.com/2013/03/ben-wheatley-is-going-down-the-silk-road-for-hbo.html<br /><br />Let&#039;s speculate about it :)&nbsp; Or maybe we can write them some storylines :D<br /><br />I think it will fictionalise DPR&#039;s creation of Silk Road and its subsequent meteoric rise.&nbsp; It will throw in a few real events (420 Sale&amp;Giveaway, tony76 scam) and will have lots of &#039;near misses&#039; of him getting caught.&nbsp; It will have another character of the law enforcement officer who has made it his life mission to track down DPR and he will get tantalisingly close, but never quite make it.<br /><br />It might throw in a friendship/rivalry between DPR and Satashi Nakamoto too.<br /><br />Anyone else?

				The Sopranos was responsible for the takedown of much of the American Mafia in NJ during the early 2000s. Again, I will say press can only be neutral or negative for SR. As DPR has said, we are not strong enough to attack our enemies directly. Throwing our presence in everyone&#039;s face is as direct as it gets. Not to mention, this exposure is advertising, which will result in more fools and/or young people purchasing narcotics - a liability to vendors.<br /><br />There are plenty of publicized and non-publicized cases of children receiving drugs through the postal service. The parent&#039;s first instinct is to call the police who in turn notify the federal government.

				Ugh. I do really hope they don&#039;t make any documentary or public discussion about SR unless it&#039;s already been shut down. As soon as it goes public, you know that LE will be forced to step in more aggressively. Just like with the clearnet RC market that used to exist (WebTryp, anyone?). We need to keep it OG and down-low. <br /><br />Much love to the ones keeping it real :)

				It would probably start at MIT or Nippon, sometime around 2008. Maybe even in the 1990s with the housing bubble crash in Nippon, to give a good background on geopolitical economics... Alogn with a parallel story line that follows a trafficker, moving la coca into the U.S., where he gets caught by the Coast Guard, stash seized and the Coast Guard captain leave him stranded each time with no food or water on a sailboat...<br /><br />Enter Satoshi Nakamoto... never showing his face, but only him working on mathematical theory and comptuer programming, collaborating with a handful of others tirelessly over TOR and i2p. Bring in some of the forum posts and threads... HBO style.<br /><br />The trafficker, stranded with no water comes close to dying, barely making it back to land before dehydration kills him--eating eyes of freshly caught fish to stay hydrated, and getting a few ounces here and there from trapping evaporation, etc. He gives up on his failing lifestyle and gets a fishing job. Later that year, he comes across an old friend who works on computers. They know each other&#039;s history and share a love for sailing, and the computer friend shares the discovery of BTC.... therein lies the origins of the Road.... No more trafficking, and instead, they are now the overseers of the trafficking world...<br /><br />...<br /><br />Alternate storyboard: CIA history in Laos, etc. Trafficking, gun running... CIA founded the Road.... to reduce violence and social/political turmoil from the uncontrollable drug trade..... This would ironically give the CIA black market dollars for fighting terrorism... or just getting CIA agents really fucking rich....

				The amount of fucking bullshit I&#039;ve read in this thread makes me wanna punch a baby in the face.<br />Unwanted attention?! LE is already aware of SR. There have been fucking news reports about it in every fucking country so it&#039;s pretty much public knowledge now. Stop shitting your pants, if LE can&#039;t do anything about SR now, that won&#039;t change in the foreseeable future.<br />Besides, it&#039;s highly unlikely that an HBO series called &quot;Silk Road&quot; is about a darknet drug marketplace called &quot;Silk Road&quot;. Use your fucking brains, idiots.<br />And even if SR was shut down, people would immediately flock to BMR, Atlantis and Sheep and at least a dozen new marketplaces would pop up, trying to take its place.

				Hmm. No publicity is good publicity for the Road.<br /><br />At the same time, I love me some HBO. They seem to produce about 95% of all the good tv there is. I would definitely be interested in what they put together. However, an HBO series means drama, and that means bad things happening to good (or at least sympathetic) people. Hopefully it doesn&#039;t end up pushing the fear agenda.

				where is carman sandiago , any one? you must admit there are some paralells. is the story about Cap&#039;n Roberts true? I wonder how this all did get started and what kind of scurvy sea dog the cap&#039;n is. whats his story? i think no publicity is good publicity but I cant say I wouldn&#039;t watch the show. maybe we could infiltrate the ranks of the writers and send coded messages write through the script to let all the real sr family know where and when to be while the traditional silk road is turned into a dummy op where an ounce of weed or coke is dealt here and there , probably mostly from LE to LE lol.

				The more time we all spend on SR the more commonplace it becomes and especially when we talk about it all day long everyday on here it becomes an &#039;everyday thing&#039; but MOST people really haven&#039;t heard about SR or TOR, drug users and LE do but most people aren&#039;t drug users or LE. An HBO series about SR would be cool, probably fictional but if anything this could encourage others to open sites (BMR &amp; Atlantis) and to fight for legalization and essentially join the cause.&nbsp; On the subject of a tv show about SR i am either in favor or neutral but one thing i do know is that i will most definitely watch the first episode.

				Lets be real about this.&nbsp; HBO(and other TV network) employees are probably some of the best SR customers. <br />That is one reason why you don&#039;t see much about it on the telly.&nbsp; I guarantee you this is just like the ING investment ad, which said &quot;The NEW Silk Road&quot; or the thrift shop with the same name, funny shit, I know, but it&#039;s a coincidence.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll prolly be some dune-ish/GOT-ish story about mining unobtainium through some wormhole, and various parties jockeying to take control of the &#039;spice trade&#039; or what have you.&nbsp; &nbsp;The old SR was around for most of recorded history, so I think we need to stop seeing SR everywhere we read &quot;silk road&quot;&nbsp; the world doesn&#039;t revolve around us, we are a bunch of people who got sick of settling for poor-quality drugs, and did something about it.&nbsp; That, and a great community of people, most of whom I honestly believe want the best for each other in terms of harm reduction, safety, and have no ill will towards anyone(except scammers, fuck them.)&nbsp; Besides, Stargate Atlantis is already taken, and BMR is a large caliber rifle. =)

				Currently working on fiction that is similar to &quot;Dabbling in Suicide&quot; by ShamelessHarvey. You might even call it a sort of fan-fiction? I&#039;m sure that as it develops it will become more my own, but for now it&#039;s strikingly similar. What can I say, I love the guy&#039;s writing. :P<br />All I know is that I love writing about drugs and sex, and I think they are great vehicles with which to look at society from an outside point of view.
