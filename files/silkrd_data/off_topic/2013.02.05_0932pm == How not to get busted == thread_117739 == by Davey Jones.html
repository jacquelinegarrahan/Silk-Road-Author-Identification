				This is what I&#039;ve done over the years; never keep the same cell phone for too long, keep one phone for normal everyday stuff and the other for business.&nbsp; Once the number for the business phone gets used quite a bit, throw entire phone away, get another, repeat process.&nbsp; Never deal with new people even if they have cash, how did they come so close anyway?&nbsp; Anonymous thru the mail works good, but its not the only way.&nbsp; Create layers between you and the street.&nbsp; I would never want to be the one in the club handing half grams to people in the bathroom.&nbsp; Keep a set of friends that don&#039;t get high, they know you at least well enough to say you don&#039;t even do the shit much less sell it, basically establish a cover.&nbsp; Maintain a legit job and keep the business away from work, keep up appearances, the wrong disagreement with a co-worker may get you busted.&nbsp; Doing business out of home address?&nbsp; Yeah right.&nbsp; Someone elses house is always best, or a rental space obtained with a false identity.&nbsp; Storing shit at home, another mistake that gets people busted.&nbsp; There&#039;s a hundred ways to hide shit off site and a hundred more to transport, but I can&#039;t give all my secrets away.&nbsp; Have fun

				I know, but I&#039;ve read some seriously amatuer shit about what some folks think is ok I guess.&nbsp; Whats funny to me is people standing on the street selling out in the open in the worst part of town, then going back and forth into a building they&#039;re right in front of to get more.&nbsp; Super stealth, lol

				its always good to keep a mental picture of the cars and the faces associated with your street....<br />many of us on the road do not have the luxury of multiple addresses...<br />also good to keep an eye out for lingering vehicles and people who seem to have no real connection to your street...<br /><br />basically stay aware and tuned up...you have to be in stealth mode too when receiving goods.....<br />most importantly follow your gut feeling...and do not allow greed and lust for money or a high cloud your judgement....

				Heard about the guy in Australia that got busted and was vending on the road and the street.&nbsp; Basically don&#039;t do what he did and you should be safe.&nbsp; The media tried to put attention on silk road, but I figure the guy was dumb enough to get busted probably from the street side more than the mail. Just putting basic safety procedures in place will ensure longevity and security.&nbsp; I dunno how many times I saw people getting careless because they weren&#039;t getting busted.

				I would do a bunch of small orders from vendors with high stealth rating. Stealth is just as important as price. The reason I suggest a bunch of small orders is one, if a large order were intercepted a large quantity could lead to intent to distribute charges. A large purchase will, at the least, make le take a high level of interest in you thinking you are a major person of interest. Two, you don&#039;t put all your eegs in one basket. You don&#039;t want to loose everything to a scammer. <br /><br />Hope all works out for you.

				You could also... Y&#039;know... Not sell your excess product. That gram of molly should last YOU a year and it probably cost less than a couple rolls. Did you buy up a QP? You&#039;re a daily smoker and you just cut your smoking expenses in half. Fuck those fuckers that think their greenbacks mean they can smoke YOUR green.<br /><br />You&#039;re on the road. You don&#039;t work with street dealers ever again. You got yours, and you didn&#039;t spend a lot of money. Be happy.

				I had a dude call me on my burn phone that I sorta knew.&nbsp; He&#039;s saying another guy I&#039;ve known for alot longer gave him the number, then he&#039;s hinting around about getting some shit so I&#039;m like &quot;man, I dunno, I&#039;m really not into it, so I&#039;m not sure where you could look either&quot; That was that.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m getting rid of that phone and go get another one.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care how much money he had.&nbsp; I&#039;m stayin invisible.
