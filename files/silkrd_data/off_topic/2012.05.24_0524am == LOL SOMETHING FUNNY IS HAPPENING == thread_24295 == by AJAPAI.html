				One time at a festival, my buddy wanted to try MDMA for the first time i had a bunch of crystal MDMA, so i started popping a couple caps, and gave him two. <br /><br />I started coming up hard and he told me he didn&#039;t feel it, i was so giddy and fucked i told him to eat a couple more and ate a couple more myself.<br /><br />About 20min later i realized what i did...<br /><br />He tripped balls, on MDMA. <br /><br />I was a little worried, but he had the best day of his entire life haha

				If you really want to fuck with him, start speaking random gibberish while raising and lowering your voice. Then when he asks what the hell you were saying tell him you haven&#039;t spoken in over two hours. It&#039;ll confuse the shit out of him! ;D

				I love seeing people that think they can handle shit go overboard but I am not for fucking with someone once they are out of their mind. Had a friend with PTSD that was on all these benzos and lithium and shit and 2cx just wouldn&#039;t affect him. I watched him SNORT over 100mg of my bomb 2ci, takes me 20-30 orally, and he didn&#039;t feel a thing and you can&#039;t hide shit like that. On new years he had been off his PTSD stuff for a couple weeks and ate 60mg of 2ci and he sat in the same recliner in a dark room for like 8 hours just smiling his ass off while we were upstairs partying all on the same stuff. He said he was visualizing so hard he&nbsp; didn&#039;t think he was afraid to stand up because he might fall through the carpet lol

				Haha I know a person like this also, he said he can &quot;conquer any drug&quot; so finally I gave him 20mg of 2c-i, said he didn&#039;t feel anything even though his pupils were dilated as hell and we were all tripping. So next week I gave this person 3.5g of some shrooms but I made it into a tea and he drank it thinking it wasn&#039;t going to work, well ten minutes later he starts going into the jungle&nbsp; ;D. <br /><br />Ever since that trip he&#039;s probably the nicest person I know, he want from complete douchebag to nicest person ever because of one intense shroom trip, that&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about!
