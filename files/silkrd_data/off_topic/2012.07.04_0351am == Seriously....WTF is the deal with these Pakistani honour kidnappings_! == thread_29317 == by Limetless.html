				It&#039;s backward culture and their filthy religion.<br /><br />Sorry, just true.<br /><br />When you have a culture that is based on INSANE principles and the ramblings of a pedophilic epileptic peasant, this sort of stuff is just the abstractions that naturally arise from it. <br /><br />So it starts off as all praise be to God, and soon enough it develops into these strict moral codes of discipline and tradition. Religion isn&#039;t even the cause here, it&#039;s just the EXCUSE used by insecure, jealous, cuckolded men, to oppress women&#039;s sexuality and expression. So they develop these structures of oppression, one of which is arranged marriages, another is veiling women.. It all comes from fear of women&#039;s sexuality.<br /><br />And they excuse themselves by saying its about &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot;.. Which is true. It&#039;s about respect and tradition, within a culture that shits all over a true notion of respect, because they&#039;re blinded by their vapid traditions. <br /><br />Yeah Lim, I know a lot of muslims too. Got Pakistani blood in me a few generations back.The ones that generally don&#039;t care, are the ones that have been the most westernized, and live by western values of hedonism. <br /><br />For example I used to know a guy that if pressed, would say he really did believe in Mohammed and the Kuran/Hadith etc (and I&#039;m sure in his own mind he was certain that he did), but then on the weekend would be banging out lines of coke with me and macking on chicks. I&#039;d ask.. isn&#039;t that hiram? And he&#039;d say.. Yeah, but Allah will forgive me.<br /><br />So he couldn&#039;t manage his life by saying, I don&#039;t believe in this stuff, because it&#039;s his whole family etc. So he&#039;d keep up appearances and have a vague belief in a creator and a divine plan, but really, he knew that his own religion wasn&#039;t really practicable in all its specifics. These are the people I refer to when I say they are &quot;most westernized&quot;<br /><br />

				Yes I have to say that not ALL muslims are this way. It is a generalization but is a common way of life for a lot of people especially outside of the UK. Here, they have to at least kind of integrate and live by the laws of our land, not sharia law. Though in highly concentrated asian areas of the UK like Bradford, parts of West Midlands, Southall, areas of the East End London, it is basically like a little asia in those places and they live as though still in their own countries. I think it is these area&#039;s where this behaviour is taking place.<br /><br />Its a very hot topic and stirs a lot of emotions as it is extreme behaviour!!

				Yeah, the irony is though that places like India have progressed so the Indian&#039;s here act more conservative than their family in India that they try to emulate.<br /><br />Pakistan has moved on a bit but tbh, they are still pretty nuts there.<br /><br />Lol yeah that does piss me off but to be fair I do hang around decent Muslims so that&#039;s why I said it.

Can I eat this food? No.. But if unsure, ask the mullah. How many times should I pray a day? Ask the mullah..<br /><br />The religion and culture is inseparable. And the culture of women-hating, oppressive males, has prospered, under a barbaric religion that claims it is the answer to everything.<br /><br />

				i think its a massive shame that a proportion of Islam resides im the 5th century.its probably the most powerful modern religeon that has failed to adapt to modernity.<br /><br />i may get neg karma for this but at least parts of the church have tried taking steps towards the future.<br />the catholics still have a long way to go,<br /><br />biggest trouble in Islam is the difficulty they have in seperating religeon and state, Turkey have done so but with great difficulty.<br /><br />its such a shame that the core messages of all religeon have been forgotten by the majority of their followers:<br /><br /><br />peace, love &amp; respect to others, the importance of community and support &amp; the furthering of the self; both mental, physical &amp; spiritual.
