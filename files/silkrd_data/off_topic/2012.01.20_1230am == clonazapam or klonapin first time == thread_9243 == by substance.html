				i may have spelled those wrong.<br />anyways<br />so i would consider myself a person that lately has been suffering from GAD General Anxiety Disorder.<br />for no specific reason really. i just stress about nothing sometimes.<br />lately ive been taking the herbal supplement called &quot;passion flower&quot; witch seems to work somewhat.<br />i have used ativan on my rough days from a friend, and they work great.<br /><br />so today at work my friend walks up and hands me 2 little yellow pills. he tells me theyre clonazapam.<br />i quickly googled these to make sure they were what they were.<br />clonazapam 1mg split line on the back.<br /><br />so after first break i break one in half and pop it in my mouth. (im kinda&nbsp; a lightweight and didnt want to overdo anything at work)<br />I go to my work area, and i instantly just start feeling strange. uncomfortably strange. my anxiety kicks in.<br />i felt as if i was coming up on a weird trip at first i just felt the inside of me drop.<br />so im starting to panic and feel lots of anxiety. im walking back and forth to the drinking fountain trying to get my mind off everything.<br />telling myself &quot;good thing i took a pill that cures panic attacks&quot; if only itd start working correctly!<br />I was considering going home to lay in my bed. i just did not want to be at work at this point.<br />this feeling was pretty uncomfortable. it was as if the high hit my body before it got to my brain.<br />after about 30-45 mins things started to chill out. i could feel the klonapin working as it should although it still felt a little edgy.<br /><br />do some people just not go good with this stuff?<br />its like it did the opposite of what it should.<br />seems like id never want to take this if i was about to have a panic attack or just having bad anxiety.<br />although ativan makes all my troubles go away. klonapin is just... idk.<br /><br />is this normal/have you heard anything like this?<br />l8er

				it takes about what you said 45 min. what was happening to you was your problem in react mode. people with gad and pinic disorder are a hyperaugmented lot. physically they generate sensations in responce to even something that will eventually help them.....a drug...an unfamiliar drug.

				i really appreciate your guys opinions Because for the longest time i didnt even understand what anxiety was until aabout a year ago.<br />I used to medicate with ganja daily until i had a panic attack on some hard core sativa.<br />i can still stay under the radar with 1 to 2 hits of some indica hash.<br /><br />that makes total sense. I started to feel the drug before its ant-anxiety effects kicked in so i started panicking because i was high on something i didnt quite understand, and it wasnt doing what i was expecting.<br /><br />normally i take .5mg of ativan<br /><br />one time i got to high on weed and started panicking so i just popped a whole one under my tongue and went for a walk until i felt better<br /><br />although i only took .5mg of the kpin i still felt kinda &quot;high&quot; if you will.<br />everyone at work thought i was depressed or &quot;not acting normal&quot; lol<br />id imagine if i took the whole thing id be incapable of working but i really dont know..

				Please remember, that Benzo withdrawal is HARD CORE! It isn&#039;t a joke. It&#039;s one of the only withdrawals that can kill you. Horrid anxiety, blood pressure fluctuations, dizziness, fear, insomnia, hallucinations, seizures, even death. I am sooo sorry if me saying this causes any anxiety, I really just want people to know what they could be getting into...Please be careful.&nbsp; Klonapin takes longer to kick in, but last longer...More for generalized anxiety. Xanax &amp; Adivan are more for panic attacks- or short, intense anxiety. Take care, Much Love.
