				Hi Dutch1337,<br /><br />Bumping your own threads is not appreciated here; it is essentially spamming.<br />If someone has information pertaining to the topic at hand, they would have replied to you. I imagine the reason nobody is responding, however, is because you&#039;ve given no information about what you want to do apart from wanting to make &#039;fake Transit passes&#039;. You&#039;ve given no indication as to why you want them (I presume it&#039;s to travel for free), what country the Transit passes are needed for, or your proficiency with Adobe or Corel suites etc. which you would most likely need in order to produce a passable replica.<br /><br />Forgive the expression, but if you&#039;re looking for somebody to hold your hand and wipe your ass for you, you&#039;re in the wrong place.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I live in the New York/ New Jersey area and I am looking to make a fake NJ Transit monthly pass. It has a black light image on i and also has a reflective top this can be seen b typing in NJ Transit monthly pass into Google on clearnet. the only problem&nbsp; would have is the kind of paper i would need and the reflective strip. Do you or anyone know how to determine the correct paper to use? Also where would be a good place to look for a reflective strip or making one. I am decent in adobe suites but not amazing.

They sell better than drugs and the mark up is huge. The only problem is that it is a cat and mouse game with transit, they will change the design and you have to start from square one.<br /><br />Reflective foils, holograms, magnetic stripesm, fancy barcodes and black light ink are all fakable. Just ask any fake id maker. I am not going to explain to you how that is done.<br /><br />PM me if you are willing to mail some samples to me. I would need about 5 preferably from at least 2 different months. Expired passes are fine.<br /><br />If I am able to make them I can offer them on SR.<br />

				Id be interested in them as well for the NJ/NY area problem is I dont have any old passes. However while riding the bus I have noticed the driver usually does not actually take the pass, but just looks at it, so it shouldn&#039;t be to hard. The best bet would be to go out and but the holographic tape and any special ink needed and just print them.
