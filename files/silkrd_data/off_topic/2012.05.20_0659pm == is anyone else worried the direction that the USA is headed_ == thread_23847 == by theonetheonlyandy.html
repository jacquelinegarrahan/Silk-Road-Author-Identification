				It&#039;s definitely scary to see how out of touch the government is today. I&#039;m only just reaching an age where I pay attention to this kind of thing. Some people would call us alarmists, and say that everyone starts to think the end times are coming when they reach a certain point in their lives. On the other hand, that&#039;s exactly what I would expect a sheep to say. I&#039;ll do my own thing for now, but if I ever find myself getting yelled at by a lamp post I&#039;m out of here.

				You&#039;re not alone. The only thing you can do about this is to make sure you vote, because it fucking counts. If you don&#039;t like Romney, there&#039;s always Obama, Gary Johnson, Ralph Nader, and Vermin Supreme. I don&#039;t like the idea of not voting, but that is an option, I suppose.

				been worried ever since bush took office, nothings &#039;changed&#039; with hopebama so still feeling like its only a matter of time until we are truly forced to live in a new world, 1984 type society. i mean with the authorization of thousands of drones flying around us soil, collecting surveillance... the goverment being able to turn your cell phone into a microphone for them to listen to, a video camera that they can see through, etc etc etc... its just, we&#039;re heading down a road that looks unbearably bleak and scary.

They&#039;re not really literally considered a person.<br /><br />I agree with the supreme courts decision that free speech applies to corporations. Corporations are composed of people and people have rights. You can&#039;t limit free speech just because multiple people decided to pool together to campaign for their view points.

				Secretly, I sort of hope for a new major war. This is a horrible thing to wish for, but I just have a feeling deep down in my gut that tells me things need to drastically change or we&#039;ll be facing a dystopian future similar to 1984 like chiefrogan brought up. I want to see our youth standing up for something at least, but that&#039;s not likely. They&#039;ve grown complacent with their god awful pop idols, iPhones, and Facebook. I&#039;m worried that the media and government are becoming too involved with our personal lives and more and more people are falling into this trend. This may be the cynic in me talking but it&#039;s like only the stupid are breeding. Fifteen years ago my town was strictly a ranching/farming community and everyone knew each other and owned acres of land. Now they&#039;re building the ninth school within a fifteen mile radius of me thanks to the fucking Mormons causing overpopulation and it&#039;s getting a bit too claustrophobic for me. It used to be a friendly town, now it&#039;s full of business type assholes and I hate it. I can walk around the new mall and literally see teenagers texting each other as opposed to actually having conversations and it&#039;s frightening.<br /><br />The state of affairs within my favorite country, Japan, also has me scared for the future. The Japanese are literally facing extinction in the next few hundred years and scientists believe it&#039;s because of technology. Senior citizens outnumber the youth, they seriously aren&#039;t socially interacting or even having sex because of technology. They choose to stay comfortably in the confines of their own home without the need to go out thanks to their advancement of sex toys and online communities. That&#039;s pretty fucking sad to me, I really enjoy sex personally. :&#039;(<br />

				Empires fall. When a country sets it&#039;s heart on empire.. and expands it&#039;s power beyond the borders of the people who instinctively feel themselves to be part of it... it is only a matter of time before it falls.<br /><br />In this day and time Empires rise faster, go higher, and fall further and faster than in times past.<br /><br />This Empire will die like all the others.. the question is.. will you and your kin and friends survive the fall?<br /><br />If you are uncertain.. perhaps you should be planning harder for a worst case scenario.

Senior citizens outnumber the youth, they seriously aren&#039;t socially interacting or even having sex because of technology. They choose to stay comfortably in the confines of their own home without the need to go out thanks to their advancement of sex toys and online communities. That&#039;s pretty fucking sad to me, I really enjoy sex personally. :&#039;(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gary you are one messed up mother fucker, however it is what makes me love to read your posts. :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>you sir are HIGHlarious <br />Yeah...it&#039;s a load of bollocks too, but it&#039;s still fun to consider.

				I think a zombie apocalypse would be the raddest thing ever, and not like that Resident Evil bullshit but more like a form of rabies similar to 28 Days Later. Can you imagine tripping on acid while running for your life from a horde of zombies out in the English countryside? Now that would be the scariest thing ever! :o<br /><br />The scariest thing I can imagine happening to me would be something along the lines of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Basically these alien phantoms invade Earth which have the ability to literally suck the spirit out of humans, killing them instantly. The idea of having my soul stolen is a fate worse than Hell, and I&#039;m sure those with experience with DMT will agree. :P<br /><br />Anyways, getting back on topic...this thread reminds me of this horrible film I&#039;ve seen on Netflix titled Zenith. It depicts a post-apocalyptic future where society has been genetically altered to be void of all emotion other than happiness. The only way to feel alive is to take an illegal drug which causes pain. I turned it off after a few minutes because it was terrible, but the idea isn&#039;t too far-fetched. ::)

				Hey lim, I thought of you the other night... I went to a clandestine chicken boxing match (aka cock fight) and I thought...<br /><br />&quot;hmmm... If limitless could get one of those gaf&#039;s (the blade they put on the ckickens leg) around his prick, he could stripe a bastard while cock slapping him&quot;<br /><br />Anyway. I love how the OP thinks Romney is a bad choice because he is wealthy. Sure, the guy who has turned everything into gold that he has ever touched has got to make a horrid president.<br /><br />Romney might not be for legalizing drugs, but neither is Obama. Romney might not be for gay marriage, but Obama wasn&#039;t either until last week, and I aint gay so I dont care.<br /><br />Foreign policy wise, Obama has continued everything Bush did, so how can Romney be worse...<br /><br />Domestically, Obama is a fuck up, lets fire his ass.
