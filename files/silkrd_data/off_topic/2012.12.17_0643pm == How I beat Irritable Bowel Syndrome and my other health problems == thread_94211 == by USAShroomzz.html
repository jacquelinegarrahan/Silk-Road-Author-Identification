				If any of you have purchased chocolate bars from me recently you have been seeing my posts on how my health has been deteriorating over the past couple years.&nbsp; I am glad to say that I have found the answers to what was ailing me and most likely ailing you if you are in a similar situation.<br /><br />Really it all started about 8 years ago when I first got into lsd/shrooms/etc..&nbsp; I remember my first two trips were on shrooms and it was amazing and no problems.&nbsp; My third trip was on strong LSD blotter and was very intense and eye opening.&nbsp; But I noticed that I started having muscle cramps and tightness during the trip which I summed up as just dehydration issues.&nbsp; The next morning I woke up with both the insides of my thighs charley horsing (intense cramping) badly, I was screaming in pain.&nbsp; My friend brought me water and I drank about 1/2 gal right there and the charley horses subsided soon.&nbsp; This I believe set a bad precedent of being addicted to water while tripping as the solution to muscle tightness.&nbsp; I eventually was drinking up to 3 gal of water a day tripping or not, to prevent waking up with charley horses in my calves or thighs.&nbsp; Also to note while tripping I am the only one standing up and moving around for 8 hours straight, that is why my legs were the victims.<br /><br />Years later I figured out that I could drink salt and vinegar solution (pickle juice) and that would stop the cramping much better, but I was still drinking 2+ gallons of water a day.&nbsp; Then about 2 years ago I began becoming very sensitive to the cold.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t go outside under 50f without having to wear coveralls and 2-3 layers of clothing.&nbsp; It progressively got worse and worse til not only was i sensitive to the cold, it was making me feel ill as well.<br /><br />Then about 1 year ago I began getting what seemed like food poisoning out of no where every couple months.&nbsp; I blamed all kinds of products, even my mom&#039;s homemade pie, which all ended up being fine as it was my gut health that was causing the food poisoning symptoms.&nbsp; I went on the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apples, toast) for a month and things got slightly better.&nbsp; I found that if I took 4-5 beano tablets with every meal I could eat small good meals like steak/chicken and potatoes and even tolerate some fast food.&nbsp; So for months I went through a 100count bottle of beano every week.&nbsp; But then the cold sensitivity started coming back worse with the ill feelings.&nbsp; This is when I began searching for a better answer and came across raw milk kefir and kombucha as a probiotic method to heal me.&nbsp; I now understood that the root of my problems was with my gut health and the microflora in me.<br /><br />I was in a ball in pain on the couch till the first day I was able to acquire and use the raw milk kefir.&nbsp; Wow, what an instant relief it was.&nbsp; A couple weeks later I got into making my own kombucha as well and was on a kefir/kombucha regimen for several months.&nbsp; I drank them like a slimfast diet for morning and lunch and had a light dinner.&nbsp; A secondary goal of mine was to diet and cut my weight down till i was trim (I was about 60lbs overweight).&nbsp; I still had to take beano during dinner but at least things seemed like they were going the right direction.&nbsp; I still was sensitive to the cold but at least I didn&#039;t feel as ill throughout the day.<br /><br />Then a couple weeks ago I ate some runny eggs for breakfast and dinner I had some homemade sauerkraut and spicy italian sausage.&nbsp; It was all very good but it made the junk in my gut go into overdrive and manifest itself.&nbsp; At first I thought I had salmonella poisoning from the eggs because the symptoms were similar and intense.&nbsp; I never went to the doctor because I had no fever or blood in my crap, and I hate doctors and hospitals with a passion.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had severe diarrhea and vomiting.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t eat any food for 3 days and couldn&#039;t even drink water for 2 days.&nbsp; I kept hydrated by swishing ice water which gave me relief too (i didn&#039;t realize how important the ice was till later).&nbsp; I looked like I came straight out of a old western movie, all dehydrated and a mess.&nbsp; My body weight dropped from 198 to 182 in just 4 days.&nbsp; Fortunately I followed a remedy program from&nbsp; http://www.grandmas-wisdom.com/salmonella.html&nbsp; where the 4th day i began eating peeled apples.&nbsp; A major difference in this was that I had always been eating processed applesauce for the BRAT diet and not fresh apples.&nbsp; Did you know fresh apples contain a high percentage of beneficial bacteria?&nbsp; Processed applesauce is pasteurized, killing the bacteria.&nbsp; Soon I was eating small pieces of apples and bananas and feeling somewhat better.&nbsp; <br /><br />But then things got waaay worse.&nbsp; I began losing control of my body heat and started feeling like I had the actual flu.&nbsp; I was constantly sweating which made me colder and colder.&nbsp; The back of my hands felt like ice and when I breathed it felt like ice coming out my nose.&nbsp; To desperately heat up I sat in my bathroom with the heater on high and the hot water running.&nbsp; Because I was still so hungry from fasting and could only eat like 2-3 apples a day I was breathing hard.&nbsp; The combination of sweating in the steam heat and breathing hard put me into a hyperventilation state.&nbsp; But I wasn&#039;t concerned because I had actually beat previous illness by a similar manner, where saturating my body with oxygen killed off the problem.&nbsp; I would breath so hard and fast my skin went numb, couldn&#039;t maintain balance, and could feel &#039;waves&#039; of oxygen buzzing over my face.&nbsp; I probably went through this procedure 5-6x&#039;s over 3 days, each time probably sweating out a half gallon into my clothes.&nbsp; It temporarily worked but I was still having to raise my house temperature higher and higher to feel OK.&nbsp; Then fortunately one night my brother came over and I was in very bad shape.&nbsp; I tried talking to him but my words drolled off midsentence and it felt like my brain was hot and dying (which it was).&nbsp; He was scared and tried to convince me to have him call my mother to take me to the hospital.&nbsp; I debated that the problem had to be low blood sugar or low protein intake because I had fasted for so long.&nbsp; I drank some 7up and about 1/3 gallon of whole raw milk and started feeling back in control.&nbsp; So after a few hours we decided everything was alright for the moment but if i got worse tomorrow I&#039;d go see the doctor.&nbsp; What I didn&#039;t realize at the time was that it was not low sugar or low protein but the coldness of the pop and milk.&nbsp; <br /><br />That night I woke up to the same, and even worse situation, feeling colder than ever and my stomach hurt badly.&nbsp; I went through one last sweat out session in the bathroom but wasn&#039;t getting anywhere with it this time.&nbsp; Because my insides hurt so bad I decided to chug a large glass of ice water.&nbsp; Amazingly the sweating and the symptoms began to lower, so I continued drinking LOTS of ice water.&nbsp; Eventually the sweating stopped and I actually felt comfortable in shorts and the house temp back down to normal.&nbsp; I was perplexed... why had icewater made me feel warmer when I felt soooo cold??&nbsp; Thinking about it I realized that the foundational problem with me (and other IBS, etc patients) is that the gut flora inside me is out of control, growing to quickly, both good and bad microbes.&nbsp; Like a bag of wet compost in the summer sun, it all heated me up from the inside out.&nbsp; My body&#039;s defense was to sweat out the extra heat, which it had to make me feel cold so that I would do the things to warm up and sweat.&nbsp; If I had gone one day longer without ice water I believe I very well could have died from heat exposure.<br /><br />Afterwards I was left with a ringing bad headache and slight fever which lasted for about 3-4 days.&nbsp; I made sure to take a max dose of ibuprofen every day to keep the fever in check.&nbsp; Even a week later my head still hurts a little from all the stress.&nbsp; I truely feel that this is the main cause of every person&#039;s poor gut health, the regulation of how much and what biological activity is taking place inside the stomach and intestines.&nbsp; I hope by reading this you are able to heal yourself or someone else.&nbsp; Now I am back to drinking kefir and kombucha to further protect and strengthen the good beneficial microbes inside me as well as drinking icewater throughout the day and with every meal.&nbsp; Also I don&#039;t have any muscle cramps/tightness and I don&#039;t have to drink so much water all day.&nbsp; I don&#039;t find the need to have to smoke so much weed anymore too to improve my health.&nbsp; God Bless!<br />

				Hey man,<br />I read everything you wrote, start to finish, and I&#039;m glad you&#039;re OK for now, but I hate to say it, but I really think you need to see a real doctor. <br />I get it, I really do, I hate doctors with a passion too-- they&#039;ve fucked me over numerous times, they mis-diagnose and under-diagnose and are elitist fucks like mad, treat a lot of people very poorly, but in this case, you&#039;ve got a serious physical problem going on that&#039;s only getting worse and worse, and for all the shit doctors do, they do a lot of very helpful, life-saving things as well, with treatments only they have access to provide, and that self-diagnosing alternative medicine does sometimes fail to cure (with devastating consequence). <br />You say you&#039;ve beaten it, but honestly, I read your whole post and it doesn&#039;t sound at all like you have-- you&#039;re just in a current state of temporary relief as the symptoms lessened. You don&#039;t know when those symptoms are going to come back in full force, or so much stronger that it has irreversible damage or death involved. I&#039;d honestly be the last person to vouch for doctors in most situations, people treat &#039;em like gods and while they have very valuable education, they&#039;re still often negligent/careless/overestimate themselves like any other humans, but this isn&#039;t something you can take lightly, and you really need to at least get a second opinion on what&#039;s going on with your body-- IBS doesn&#039;t cover all your symptoms, and Occam&#039;s Razor and all that-- you might have something much more serious of which you&#039;re mistaking a subset of its symptoms for IBS and not accounting for the other concurrent symptoms. Could be some kind of chronic viral infection, could be a thyroid disorder, you don&#039;t know... At least get some lab tests?<br />Even if you don&#039;t take my suggestion to heart, I wish the best for you and hope your health improves.<br />Best wishes.

				USAShroomzz great report man. Not everybody has insurance or the money to go to a doctor every time a symptom happens. It&#039;s hard to just fly off to ER when you know the bill will come home.<br /><br />There&#039;s all kinds of discoveries about the true powers of water and those that refuse to evolve and learn about the new age thinking will be left with dawrins natural selection option. I believe that God is behind the whole thing tho. I believe the earth was created with all this functionality. You can dam well heal yourself and create your own reality. Doctors aren&#039;t as smart as people think and they are corrupted by big insurance business. Don&#039;t get me wrong there is a place for all forms of healing. <br /><br />You don&#039;t have to drink tons of water but a little a day helps and a bath everyday helps. You are water. So meditate (pray) in or with water daily. Hold thoughts of gratitude 100% of the time if you can. Let negative thoughts flow out as easily a they flow in. You can not stop them but you don&#039;t have to stew on them. Can you believe that water is susceptible to suggestions or thought frequencies?<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW5KkTokPSQ&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell me this series of videos is Bullshit?<br /><br />Anybody who wants to talk more about this please feel free to PM me or post here and I&#039;ll try to check back.

				Let me better explain why I wont see a doctor about this.&nbsp; If I broke a leg, or cut myself badly, etc... I would surely go to the hospital.&nbsp; But in cases of disease and illness I am going to do my best to find the proper home remedy.&nbsp; The situation that stands out in my mind is that one of my cousins died a couple years ago from advanced Chrone&#039;s disease.&nbsp; He started out like me, having stomach/intestinal problems.&nbsp; He went to the doctor and they gave him some pills and told him to eat nothing but the BRAT diet for the rest of his life.&nbsp; His disease progressed to having cysts in his intestines, then to full on Chrone&#039;s disease.&nbsp; His bowels eventually literally burst from the inside from the buildup of gas and he died a very very painful death.&nbsp; Doctors did nothing and could do nothing for him because they have no clue how to heal the disease, only how to bill medicare and insurance for hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br /><br />The same is true for EVERY patient with IBS/IBD/Chrones,&nbsp; there is no cure, nor treatment other than eating bland tasteless food the rest of your life and then you still die a shitty death.&nbsp; I remember a recent podcast of the Joe Rogan show that he had a German medical researcher on that made an excellent case that chemotherapy and AIDS therapy/drugs are killing patients who would heal if they had just changed their lifestyle to a healthier one.&nbsp; This is the reason AIDS patients look like they are getting better when they enter the hospital, because they are no longer shooting up drugs and living among other nasty individuals who pass the HIV virus to them.&nbsp; The doctors get to bill them $1000 for treatment and they all die,... except Magic Johnson who obviously paid off the medical establishment for the real truth.<br /><br />There are excellent and loving doctors out there, but they are mired by the top of the medical big pharma lobby that wishes only to make a buck.&nbsp; Also the health care system in America is really coming to a close in the next few years with Obamacare so I feel they wont even be an option to save your life in the near future unless you are loaded with cash.

				Hi, sorry to hear your story and I&#039;m glad your finding your own way to combat your symptoms. Like you said there is no cure for IBS or chrones, only ways of reducing symptoms, which can have varying triggers for each individual. I think the overwhelming consensus on here will be to SEE A DOCTOR,&nbsp; just for a diagnosis. So you might be able to structure a better plan/ lifestyle for your self. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to sound picky but hyperventilating causes you to blow off too much carbon dioxide not overload on oxygen.&nbsp; When you hyperventilate you are taking in and expelling&nbsp; the same percentages of gases with each breath but at a higher rate of resps per minute. Carbon dioxide is slightly acidic, so by exhaling rapidly you are removing more carbon dioxide than normal, this upsets the bloods delicate pH level and causes your blood to go slightly alkaline. This is what causes all the sensations. When you say you have beaten other &#039;illnesses&#039; by doing this it might have been deep not rapid breathing, as this can stimulate the vagus nerve, causing your heart rate and bp to alter. People who meditate are a good example of how they use breathing to calm their body and mind. Old school martial artists used it in a slightly different way to produce adrenaline through breathing, in order get that rush or panicked feeling, so that they can learn to remain calm and focused during the &#039;fight or flight&#039; response. I know I&#039;ve gone on and you know your body better than me but i think it shows you don&#039;t know everything( I&#039;m not even hinting I do) and it does no harm to seek help when needed, esp when it&#039;s your health dude<br /><br />

I used to be stuck in a similar way of thinking before I was humbled by seeing the uglier sides of life. I can&#039;t do it no more. I can&#039;t wine and play the part of the victom when I am so blessed with knowing the secrets that open all the doors of my desires. Sometimes it&#039;s hard to realize that I can not help others with this. It is up to them to take posession of their own mind and control every thought they have. Some have called me crazy and others watch in amazement as they see things come into fruition. <br /><br />The fact is there is a war going on inside the mind of each and every one of us. It&#039;s a war between the positive thoughts and the negative thoughts. It&#039;s up to you to decide which way you are going to side with. Disease, germs, and sickness can not survive in a body that is dominated by a mind with good positive thought vibrations. Your mind literally recreates your body every 2 to three years. It produces new cells daily and in a couple of years your&nbsp; whole body is has been replenished with the cells that are manipulated by your mind. You are made up of 60 to 80 percent water depending on your daily intake and the more the better. <br /><br />When you change your thinking habits it takes some time to see the evidence. You are where you are today from years of habitual ways of thinking. When you start thinking on purpose you have got to forcefully do it until it becomes a habit and it becomes effortless for you to be giving thanks for something with every second. When the habit is formed you will see the magic un folding before your eyes. Thoughts of gratitude toward your body parts while bathing is a healing ritual for me. I came upon this knowledge a couple of years ago and I feel better today then I have felt in the last ten years prior to this discovery. <br /><br />What led me to search for this was I was stuck in a bad cycle and I knew there had to be another way of living. I knew that there was something wrong with the world and it wasn&#039;t right. I found out it was me who wasn&#039;t right and when I changed my paradigm things started going my way with no effort.<br />Now instead of being controlled by drugs I am in control instead of running around like an idiot looking for pills and other drugs all the time. Everybody that is around me can see a huge difference and they talk about it. While my old friends are no longer around new friends are popping up and have the utmost respect for me. Now if I have an accident and break a bone or something then dam right take me to the ER but this new way of thinking is more of a preventative measure and prevents those kinds of accidents along with sickness and disease. <br /><br />I believe in God but I don&#039;t follow any religion. I like the philosophies of Napoleon Hill and the seven hermetic laws. These 2 are not connected except by me.<br /><br />Please reply anyone who wants to know more. Thank you

				i&#039;ve been struggling with ibs for the past 2 years and psychedelics have helped me start the healing process, mushrooms in particular. ibs has something to do with communication problems between the brain and gi tract, so it makes sense why psychedelics have helped. cannabis treats all my symptoms and i&#039;ve been taking peppermint oil capsules as well as acacia fiber, which work wonders.
