				Haha I remember one time I saw a 40ft mannequin walking down the road in front of me.&nbsp; It sort of leaned over and then split into three and they all walked away in different directions.&nbsp; ...I didn&#039;t realize that wasn&#039;t normal until the next morning ???&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Same night I definitely looked over at my friend and said &quot;Dude. That tree is telling me the meaning of life! I know it! I just can&#039;t understand &#039;cause I&#039;m too high to speak tree.&quot; Legitimately felt a Grandmother Willow moment there though. ::)

				My one time taking LSD - took 3 tabs, (no idea what strength, the guy who got them said they were &quot;double-dipped&quot;, they were &quot;The Budda&quot; printed) first time. And it was my 5th time doing drugs, ever.<br /><br />I got CEV&#039;s modelling how consciousness interacts with the modern world, and OEV&#039;s like seeing through things, &quot;mouse-trails&quot; on any moving object, auras around people.<br /><br />When we had to go for a walk near the end of the day, (this was a snowy winter night by now), the paths and sidewalks kept stretching to infinity in front of me, but I was traveling at near-warp speed. It was incredible.

				Mine is just kinda funny.<br />The first time I did drugs is when my friend got some pot brownies.<br />He said only to eat 1 but I ate 3 so in my extreme highness, I left and ended up taking a taxi to a mall.<br />2 hours later, I ended up getting kicked out for hosting a &quot;mini-olympics&quot; in a furniture store.<br />I kept yelling that I&#039;d won the gold metal for long jump (I was jumping on beds lol).

				Has to be either:<br />taking tabs in Joshua Tree<br /><br />or<br /><br />Smoking DMT<br /><br />No desire to do either now, those two things were pretty intense&nbsp; ::)
