				First of all, sorry if this is in the wrong thread.&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Just wondering why lots of US sellers (for weed) don&#039;t ship international? The prices for the vendors that only ship to the US are a LOT lower then ones that ship worldwide...? Even with shipping costs included the prices are a lot lower then vendors that ship to EU/US.<br /><br />I understand it the main issue is the possible risk of a vendors face being shown on CCTV cameras e.t.c But then surely can&#039;t you just whack a few postage stamps on a package to cover international postage and then put it in a letterbox?<br /><br />and also wasn&#039;t there another vendor that was reshipping class A&#039;s to other countries for another vendor (I think it was paperchasing but I might be wrong)<br /><br />I hope some of the USA-only shippers reconsider this option or at least have a whitelist of countries they would ship to, I&#039;m in the UK so can&#039;t imagine US - UK being a problem...and there&#039;s big money to be made with the ridiculous prices of weed over here...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				because it has to go through US customs if it goes out of the US and they check it alot better for drugs so the risk of getting caught is way to high for most people

				Yeah...but millions and millions of items get sent outside the US every day so providing the shipping is discrete (as nearly everyone on SR&#039;s is due to the sellers contract) and doesn&#039;t look dodgy it should pass through fine.<br /><br />Especially if it&#039;s heading to UK? This is what I don&#039;t get...
