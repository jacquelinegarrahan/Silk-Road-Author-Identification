				You did nothing wrong. That&#039;s a common occurrence. I puked or felt sick the first few times I did opiates.<br /><br />In fact, I felt that way the last time I did an opiate, after not having done any for over a year.<br />

				40mg of Oxy without any opiate tolerance is a pretty big dose man. Taking too much can make an opiate high feel like shit, specifically nausea. If you haven&#039;t, you really should read more into the drugs you do. Erowid is a great resource for non-biased drug related information.<br />Maybe try 10-20 mg to begin with. 20mg of Oxy usually fucks me up pretty well and I have 0 tolerance.<br /><br />Also, I wouldn&#039;t rush into Heroin. I don&#039;t think it will end well.

				break that 40 into 10mg quarters and start with a quarter. blowing a 40 with 0 tolerance or no experience with opiates was a bit daft

				It also takes many times to teach your brain how it works.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see the buzz gets more rewarding the more you do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I bet in a week you&#039;ll be a pro.&nbsp; Next week you&#039;ll be in withdrawals and wishing to die. <br />Never use more than two days in a row

				With no tolerance, you could of got high probably 4 times off of that 40, you overdid it. And, don&#039;t go rushing into H, especially don&#039;t IV it your first time. Sounds like your begging for a problem. I remember when I first started on oxys, OC&#039;s not them freaken OP&#039;s, a 20 would get me high twice, maybe even 3 times. Fast forward bout 4-5 yrs and I was doing 12-15 OC 80&#039;s a day just to be able to function. I beat em but it was hell and I didn&#039;t use opiates for a good 3 yrs after that and now I only occasionally allow myself a &quot;break&quot; and get a little itchy.<br />&#039;

				Heroin / Oxys are odd drugs. When my buddy and I snorted Oxys for the first time he described the sensation as the closest he&#039;d come to absolute bliss and I got a weedy buzz that was about as good as drinking a bottle of cough medicine. The vomiting thing is natural but be careful. 40mgs of Oxy is a fucking lot to snort my friend. I&#039;d start with 10 - 15mgs.

				Oxycodone effects people differently.&nbsp; Some people like me don&#039;t have much/any of the enzyme in their liver that converts oxycodone into oxymorphone and something else.&nbsp; I snorted three 30mg roxis my first time trying oxycodone and I didn&#039;t really feel anything.&nbsp; If I snort 2 roxis and eat some xanax then I feel it stronger.&nbsp; I got TORE UP FROM THE FLOOR UP no oxymorphone though!&nbsp; I have never puked on any opiates except heroin and morphine.&nbsp; Most people puke from oxycodone before their body is accustomed to the drug.
