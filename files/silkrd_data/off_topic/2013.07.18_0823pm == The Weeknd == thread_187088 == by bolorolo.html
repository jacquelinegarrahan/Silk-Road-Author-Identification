				The pub calls me.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Sometimes, its nice to sink a few beers.<br /><br />Of course, I could use other drugs also.<br /><br />Its hot in the UK so you got to choose your drugs of choice wisely. Was tempted for some MDMA but its too hot and don&#039;t fancy dying of dehydration in a rave.<br /><br />Hash cools you down so for now, its a nice joint and I will think about what else to use later on.<br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)
