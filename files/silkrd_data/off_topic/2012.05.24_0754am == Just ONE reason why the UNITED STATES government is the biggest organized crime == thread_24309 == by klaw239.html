				The government already runs a legal drug house with their methadone clinics and they do not even follow their own guidelines that tells you why the clinics are there. I have friends who go who test positive for weed and other opiates all the time. They know that huge line of people at 5 am is there to get their fix. the only thing they stop serving you for is if they find benzos in you cause the two together can kill you. other than that they turn a blind eye to their drug test.<br /><br />Weed will eventually be made legal and eventually many others will too. Think ABOUT THIS. All the schedule one drugs for the most part the government claims are of no use to anyone&nbsp; for medical reasons. Weed. Has never killed anyone and proven PROVEN to help people not hurt people. MDMA proven to help people not hurt people. Heroin probably the purest strongest opiate for severe pain sufferers and it takes very little to take their pain away the Government claims is of no use. Why? Cause if they marketed heroin in it&#039;s pure form that is of the most and healthiest use to sufferers of chronic pain only ONE company would make those billions dollars a yr. the company producing/selling the heroin&nbsp; as with todays opiates with all its fillers and do little to help those in true chronic pain they got at least ten hands in there getting a piece of that billion dollar pie if not more. It;s all money.<br /><br />MDMA which Dr&#039;s all over was using with great success to treat people the government never said a word about till it got so big in a major city some 500.000 pills a month sold&nbsp; and you even had dr;s on phil donihue and the news saying this stuff helps people it does not hurt them.&nbsp; well think about you think paid the bribe money to the government to make this drug illegal? It was being used by the masses at clubs abd bars all throughout texas at a rate of 500.000 pills a month and the few deaths it had was always proved to be from dehydration. What are you told dehydrates you most and what not to do on X. DRINK ALCOHOL. So lets say this lil miracle party and medical pill spread all over the world and you take one and it makes you super happy and 50 times euphoric than any booze .ever could and even lets you approach chics and talk to them at the cost of 5-ten bucks a pill. Who is the world is going to but alcohol except a flat out drunk addicted to it. Bye bye budweisers billions each yr...bye bye&nbsp; Jim beams billions...you better believe these people got together and&nbsp; said this mdma stuff is a danger to our very existence. Right before the DEA banned it the Government...the Government mind you paid and funded for a test on MDMA to see if it was dangerous well they came out and said it puts holes in the brain and will do this and that and theres no going back once it happens.The government sent out post cars of this is your brain normally and this is it on X/mdma the normal brain looked fine mri scan&nbsp; the what ppl were told was a mdma induced brain looked all fucked up and damaged. well&nbsp; 5 yrs later many different countries including America did their own study NOT funded or having anything to do with the&nbsp; Government at all and each of these Dr&#039;s test all came back as MDMA having no bad side affects on the brain and said this stuff has helped many medical patients from terminal ill cancer patients to PTS sufferers to people suffering from childhood&nbsp; trauma. THe ABC news and peter jennings tried to contact the Dr that did the test for the Gov and he refused to give an interview in person or on the phone. two weeks later this Dr released a statement saying &quot; we were in error in our test findings as one of our lab assistants brought us METH and not MDMA to make these test on with peoples brains and that he withdraws is findings&quot; haha Does anyone really trust this USA government at all? i hope not. But even though he withdrew his findings its still schedule one its still illegal and the feds still sending people to prison just for trying to enjoy themselves. Pat yourselves on the back LEO&#039;s. at least those of you who support this injustice.
