				I have adhd and am trying to get my prescription upped from 60mg to 70mg vyvanse, because 70mg is usually the highest they go. I&#039;ve been on 60mg for a year and have been doing fine. The tricky part is getting my doctor to up it because last month a lot got stolen from me at school, and my doctor knows about it. He&#039;s going to suspect I&#039;m selling it. Any ideas?

				Go in for your appointment and look out the window every 3 minutes, commenting on how cute the squirrel outside is. Then every other time your doctor speaks to you, say &quot;What?&quot;. <br /><br />Just kidding, but if I were you I would just ask him. My cousin used to take Concerta for ADHD (she&#039;s a minor though so might not me the same situation) and he would up the mg/change her prescription almost any time she asked. The worst response we got was &quot;Let&#039;s try this for a little while longer, then we&#039;ll see.&quot;<br />As far as your doctor thinking you&#039;re selling them, there&#039;s not much you can do there. I mean if you just sincerely think you need a higher dose, then you probably need a higher dose or else you wouldn&#039;t be thinking about it, right?<br />Don&#039;t they usually test your pee to make sure the drug is in your system when they think you&#039;re selling pills? Someone I knew was suspected of selling her Xanax and they checked her pee every time she went in, but they never stopped giving them to her. And she WAS selling them! Lmao :)

				dude if you reported your script lost last month i would not ask for anyting for atleast a few months.&nbsp; doctors arent stupid and vyanese is a schedule 2, which means docs are very wary about writing them as they can lose their license. <br /><br />your best best is to make this like a 3 month mission.&nbsp; in the first month you go back, and say everything is good.&nbsp; the second go bnack and say how its not working as good as before., that everything is still working but you notice towards the end of the dose that its effects are wearing off.&nbsp; then in the third month go in and repeat the same thing and say its more noticble now. etc... <br /><br />as long as a doctor has a chart and history documenting this, he is pretty covered and will be more likely to help ya out.&nbsp; <br /><br />also its good to act like these things are really making your life much more productive, and now that they arent working as good your overall life quality is suffering and you would just like to get back to where you were.&nbsp; dont ask for a higher dosage, but maybe ask if there is something that can help make the medicine more effective.&nbsp; and be prepared to take a couple other suggestions and try them before getting what you want.<br /><br />you gotta play it slow or docs know whats up
