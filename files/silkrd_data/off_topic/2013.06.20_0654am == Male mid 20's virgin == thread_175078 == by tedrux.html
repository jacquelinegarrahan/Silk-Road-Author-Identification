				Have you just tried going out and drinking at a local spot where those of the opposite gender are present. Alcohol always loosens you up a little bit, gets ya a little less tight lipped.<br /><br />If I&#039;m talking to someone I think is really out of my league I sometimes struggle, but I jokingly apologize that I&#039;m really shy. Some girls think it&#039;s mad cute and will take the charge to direct a conversation then.<br /><br />You&#039;re probably overthinking it. Just go out, get sloshed, find a girl, talk for a while and ask if they want to leave with you after a while.<br /><br />

				i like virgins now and then... much easier to instruct a guy who&#039;s never been there before, to do what i want, and to teach him well, than to struggle with a guy who&#039;s convinced he knows every snooch like the back of his hand.<br /><br />but i must ask, what does a virgin in his mid-twenties look like? i only ever met one in late-twenties and he looked like the guy on the Quaker oatmeal box had been chewing rocks.

				well you know first off that atractivity is not a science of objectivity. meaning that quaker guy might have been just what some girl needed to get her off . of course there are standard deviations. most women , though markdly not all, would say brad pitt is sexually attractive (I&#039;d go for johnny depp myself but I like the avante gaurde and boheim).&nbsp; <br />I can honestly say I&#039;ve been called cute and sexy (less so on the latter). some too have called me ugly but they tend of course to be pretty dim and immature -that or I see them as such to protect my ego lol. Imagine though if you will a big furry teddy bear.&nbsp; &nbsp;lol, I get a little nervous explaining any sort detailed physical description here but I could maybe pgp you some pics if you&#039;d like to share as well.
